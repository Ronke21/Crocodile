<text>is a Japanese rock duo consisting of guitarist, composer and producer Takahiro &quot;Tak&quot; Matsumoto and vocalist and lyricist Koshi Inaba, known for their energetic hard rock tracks and pop rock ballads. B&#x27;z is one of the best-selling music artists in the world and the best-selling in their native Japan by certifications, having released 50 consecutive No. 1 singles, 27 No. 1 albums, and 4 No. 1 EPs on the Oricon music charts, and have sold more than 100 million records worldwide.

In 2003, HMV Japan ranked them at number 30 on their list of the 100 most important Japanese pop acts. In 2007, B&#x27;z became the first music act from Asia to have their handprints and signatures put up on Hollywood&#x27;s RockWalk. In 2008, they were awarded a &quot;Guinness World Record&quot; for &quot;Best-selling album act in Japan&quot;, which also notes them to be the best-selling act in Japan overall.

== History ==

=== Early works (1988–1990) ===

In the late 1980s, Tak Matsumoto had been extremely busy as a guitarist with various recording sessions and live performances, including for Tetsuya Komuro&#x27;s TM Network and Mari Hamada. On May 21, 1988, Matsumoto released his first solo album, &quot;Thousand Wave&quot;, with positive critical reception. However, wanting to start a band, he searched for band members, particularly a singer. Eventually, through his management, he listened to the demo tape of vocalist Koshi Inaba in 1988, who would later form B&#x27;z with him. At the first session, they played The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Let It Be&quot; and &quot;Oh! Darling&quot;. At the time, Japan&#x27;s music scene was experiencing a band boom. With all the digital sounds in mainstream music, the only sounds that Inaba and Matsumoto felt could not be expressed and replicated were the guitar and the human voice. As a result, they decided to keep it a two-man unit. On September 21, 1988, B&#x27;z made their debut with their first album, &quot;B&#x27;z&quot;, and single, &quot;Dakara Sono Te o Hanashite&quot;. Their music was very much a product of its times, with synthesizers and samplers sharing equal time with Matsumoto&#x27;s guitar, producing an experimental sound, very different from their later well-known hard rock sound.

Instead of immediately performing live after a debut album as many Japanese bands were doing, B&#x27;z had a clear vision of how they wanted to perform and decided to wait until they had enough material to play live. The two concentrated on recording, improving the quality of their music. Their efforts resulted in a second album, &quot;Off the Lock&quot;, released on May 21, 1989. With this second album came their first series of live performances, known better to their fans as &quot;Live-Gym&quot;. &quot;B&#x27;z Live-Gym #00&quot; started in Nagoya, continued in Osaka, and finished in Tokyo. Tickets were sold out on the day they became available. On October 21, their first mini-album (EP), &quot;Bad Communication&quot;, was released. The title track is a blend of rock and dance music and is still a classic played during their &quot;Live-Gyms&quot;. It charted for 163 weeks on the Oricon Charts. Their first nationwide tour, &quot;B&#x27;z Live-Gym #001 &#x27;Off the Lock&#x27;&quot;, covered 16 shows around Japan.

On February 21, 1990, their third album, &quot;Break Through&quot;, was released. It charted at No. 3 on the Oricon Albums Chart. To promote it, they started a tour with 22 shows nationwide. Their single &quot;Taiyō no Komachi Angel&quot; was released on June 13 and peaked at No. 1 on the Oricon Singles Chart; this started a trend of every single released since then debuting at No. 1 on the Oricon Singles Chart. Shortly after, &quot;Wicked Beat&quot;, their second mini album, was released on June 21. It also reached No. 3 on the charts. Like the band&#x27;s other releases, it became commercially successful (reaching one million certifications) retroactively between 1990 and 1991. Their fourth album, &quot;Risky&quot;, was released on November 7 and was their first album to top the charts. It was the beginning of a steady shift in the duo&#x27;s style from pop rock to 80&#x27;s hard rock. The &quot;B&#x27;z Live-Gym &#x27;90~&#x27;91 &#x27;Risky&#x27;&quot; tour, with 49 performances, also started in November. Their first music video compilation, &quot;Film Risky&quot;, was recorded in New York City and London in four weeks and was released on December 16. With a barrage of releases, 1990 came to be the busiest year for B&#x27;z.

=== Transitioning into hard rock (1991–1992) ===
Their third mini album, &quot;Mars&quot;, was released on May 29, 1991; little promotion was done for it. After releasing only two singles, B&#x27;z released their fifth album, &quot;In the Life&quot;, on November 27. The release of the album marked B&#x27;z shying away from their advanced digital sounds and more towards rock. Their first live video, &quot;Just Another Life&quot;, was out on December 11. For promotion, B&#x27;z also embarked on their &quot;B&#x27;z Live-Gym &#x27;91~&#x27;92 &#x27;In the Life&#x27;&quot; tour, with 66 performances in total. The tour started in December and managed to flow into the next year. The total number of &quot;Live-Gyms&quot; they did during that year exceeded 100.

In the summer of 1992, the &quot;B&#x27;z Pleasure &#x27;92 &#x27;Time&#x27;&quot; tour took place with 12 performances in 3 major cities. The arena-class tour had amazing features such as a huge lighting set, called the &quot;Starfish&quot;, and seats that rotated 360 degrees. October 28 marked the release of their sixth album, &quot;Run&quot;, and proved to be even more hard rock oriented than their previous albums. On December 9, they released a slightly different mini-album, &quot;Friends&quot;. Different from &quot;Run&quot;, its concept is somewhat similar to that of a movie soundtrack.

=== Switching to blues (1993–1994) ===
In early 1993, the Run tour concluded after 49 performances in 21 locations. In March, B&#x27;z released their twelfth and best-selling single, &quot;Ai no mama ni Wagamama ni Boku wa Kimi dake o Kizutsukenai&quot;, which was certified double-million by the RIAJ in 2003. They then held an open-air concert for the first time, called &quot;B&#x27;z Live-Gym Pleasure &#x27;93 &#x27;Jap the Ripper&#x27;&quot;. The shows took place at Bentenjima in Hamamatsu-city, Shizuoka on July 31 and August 1. The successful event gathered fifty thousand people per day, totaling 100,000 people in the end. Following this, B&#x27;z concentrated on recording once again, which resulted in a lot of material. On February 9, 1994, the &quot;B&#x27;z Live-Gym &#x27;94 &#x27;The 9th Blues&#x27;&quot; tour started. The tour became their longest and biggest tour thus far, managing 87 performances in a year. During the tour, their seventh and only double album, &quot;The 7th Blues&quot;, was released on March 2. The album title not only came from it being their seventh album but also after the seventh chord that is frequently used in blues. Becoming much more &quot;bluesier&quot; and soulful, this album evidently shows their lean towards blues. The album was made as kind of a &quot;fan trap,&quot; as they wanted to &quot;weed out&quot; casual and non-rock fans from their fanbase as they shifted more towards rock. It included the hit single &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me&quot; and a bluesy re-recording of &quot;Lady Navigation&quot;. &quot;The 9th Blues&quot; tour finished at the Tsukisamu Green Dome in Sapporo on December 24.

=== Adopting pop and temporary hiatus (1995–1998) ===
In the first half of 1995, B&#x27;z spent their time recording, and after creating numerous demos, they held the &quot;B&#x27;z Pleasure &#x27;95 &#x27;Buzz&#x27;&quot; stadium tour with 12 shows in 7 cities. Their eighth album, &quot;Loose&quot;, was released on November 22. &quot;Loose&quot; was concentrated on the original concept of a two-man band. While combining rock with pop, this album is well-balanced with a variety of sounds. The album sold over 3 million copies, making it their best-selling album at the time. The &quot;B&#x27;z Live-Gym &#x27;96 &#x27;Spirit Loose&#x27;&quot; tour started on March 15, 1996, and held 44 performances in 21 locations. The show opened with a short B&#x27;z action movie shot in Los Angeles. A short while afterward, B&#x27;z released their 6th mini-album, titled &quot;Friends II&quot;, on November 25. Much like &quot;Friends&quot; before it, the album displayed more of an adult-oriented rock.

During a short hiatus in 1997, Inaba released his debut solo album, &quot;Magma&quot;, on which he wrote all the music and lyrics. The album, which topped the Oricon charts, showcased another side of him, different from that of his usual image in B&#x27;z. In March, the dome tour &quot;B&#x27;z Live-Gym Pleasure &#x27;97 &#x27;Fireball&#x27;&quot; consisted of 9 performances in 5 locations. Tickets for each dome, which have a capacity of about 30 to 50 thousand people each, were all sold out. The tour included stops at Tokyo (3 nights), Nagoya, Osaka, Fukuoka, and Maebashi, all being successful. On November 19, their ninth studio album, &quot;Survive&quot;, showcased yet another new direction in sound and style. B&#x27;z&#x27;s first promotional effort for the album included performances in concert halls in Akita, Hakodate, Kōchi, Shiga, and Nagasaki, before plunging into the main tour, &quot;B&#x27;z Live-Gym &#x27;98 &#x27;Survive&#x27;&quot;, which started on January 24, 1998. On May 20, B&#x27;z released their first official compilation album, &quot;B&#x27;z The Best &quot;Pleasure&quot;&quot;, which also marked their 10th year since debuting. Every song included in this album was a huge hit and was highly acclaimed as it was the first Japanese album to sell more than 5 million copies, which was achieved by the end of the year. On June 6, the &quot;Survive&quot; tour successfully ended. In mid-1998, B&#x27;z entered a period of both rest and recording. During that period, on September 20, their second best-of album, &quot;B&#x27;z The Best &quot;Treasure&quot;&quot; was released, selling almost 4.5 million copies by the end of the year.

=== Returning to the music scene (1999–2000) ===
B&#x27;z started off 1999 by busily promoting their recent singles and their tenth studio album, &quot;Brotherhood&quot;, which was released on July 14. It is considered their heaviest rock album up to that point. The album&#x27;s track &quot;Giri Giri Chop (Version 51)&quot; was recorded with drummer Pat Torpey and bassist Billy Sheehan, both from Mr. Big. In July, another dome-class tour, &quot;B&#x27;z Live-Gym &#x27;99 &#x27;Brotherhood&#x27;&quot; began in Sapporo and included 14 performances in 7 locations. They did away with extra stage acts and concentrated on their musical performance, playing songs from the new album and many hits from the past. On August 28 and 29, they played at Yokohama International Stadium, which were the first music concerts held in that stadium and gathered a total of 140,000 people over the two days. Although the second day at Yokohama experienced heavy rain, the tour ended successfully. Shortly afterward, B&#x27;z started recording again and continued to do so throughout the rest of the year without rest.

On February 23, 2000, they released the album &quot;B&#x27;z The &quot;Mixture&quot;&quot;, which included remastered tracks of past songs, B-sides, remixes, re-recordings, and a new song. In the middle of May, they started rehearsal for the summer tour &quot;B&#x27;z Live-Gym Pleasure 2000 &#x27;Juice&#x27;&quot;, with warmup shows starting in a hall-class venue in Toyama on May 30. The tour totaled 18 shows in 10 cities, starting with a performance at the famous Nippon Budokan on June 20. Their single &quot;Juice&quot;, which featured drummer Brian Tichy, was released on July 12 and set a Japanese record of marking No. 1 in the first week, making it their 25th No. 1 single in sequence. A live video, &quot;Once Upon a Time in Yokohama: B&#x27;z Live Gym&#x27;99 &quot;Brotherhood&quot;&quot; was released on August 2. On December 6, they released their eleventh album, &quot;Eleven&quot;. B&#x27;z finished off 2000 with an appearance on the TV show Music Station Special and would start rehearsal for their next tour.

=== Induction into Hollywood&#x27;s RockWalk (2001–2007) ===

On February 26, 2001, &quot;B&#x27;z Live-Gym 2001 &#x27;Eleven&#x27;&quot; kicked off with a warmup show at the Ehime Kenmin Bunka Kaikan, which was exclusive to fan club members. The tour had 46 shows in 19 locations and 600,000 attendees. In March, they released their thirty-first and very popular single, &quot;Ultra Soul&quot;. After the Okinawa shows on June 27 and 28, B&#x27;z traveled abroad. They officially released their CDs in Taiwan and Hong Kong, and after finishing up the &quot;Eleven&quot; tour, B&#x27;z prepared for their first Asian tour, which included &quot;B&#x27;z Live-Gym in Taipei 2001&quot; and &quot;B&#x27;z Live-Gym in Hong Kong 2001&quot;.

While B&#x27;z started recording as soon as 2002 started, Tak finished two solo albums, &quot;Dragon From The West&quot;, which consists of hard rock tunes, and &quot;Hana&quot;, which includes more melodic and Asian-influenced tunes, which were released simultaneously. B&#x27;z finished their recording in the middle of May and started rehearsal in Tokyo for the Live-Gym tour that year, as well as performing with Aerosmith on the stage of FIFA World Cup Korea/Japan Official Concert International Day at Tokyo Stadium on June 27. Aerosmith later invited B&#x27;z to open for them in America, but it ultimately never happened. On July 3, their twelfth album, &quot;Green&quot;, was released. The supporting tour, &quot;B&#x27;z Live-Gym 2002 &#x27;Green ~Go★Fight★Win~&#x27;&quot; began at Saitama Super Arena on July 8 and ended at Osaka Dome on September 9, encompassing 700,000 attendees, 14 shows, and 11 cities. The live band was rounded out by bassist Billy Sheehan and Canadian drummer Shane Gaalaas. In September, after the last show in Osaka, B&#x27;z had their first US tour, &quot;B&#x27;z Live-Gym 2002 &#x27;Rock n&#x27; California Roll&#x27;&quot;, starting in San Diego at Canes Bar &amp; Grill on September 22 and The Palace in Los Angeles on September 24. On November 27, a live video, &quot;A Beautiful Reel&quot;, was released, which packaged everything that happened on the &quot;Green&quot; tour, as well as a second disc containing material from &quot;Rock n&#x27; California Roll&quot;. On December 11, their first ballad compilation album, &quot;The Ballads ~Love &amp; B&#x27;z~&quot;, was released.

2003 marked their 15th anniversary, and the two started recording at the beginning of the year, traveling to the United States in February for additional recording. Along with continuous releases, the tour &quot;B&#x27;z Live-Gym The Final Pleasure &#x27;It&#x27;s Showtime!!&#x27;&quot; started in July. This was intended as the final &quot;Pleasure&quot; tour, a series of tours focusing on less popular songs, which started in 1991. The tour kicked off on July 3 at Hakodate Shimin Kaikan and finished at Nagisa-en on September 21, which just so happened to be the day of their debut, having a total of 23 shows altogether. Since it had been 10 years since B&#x27;z performed at Nagisa-en during &quot;B&#x27;z Live-Gym Pleasure &#x27;93 &#x27;Jap the Ripper&#x27;&quot; in 1993, it gathered 100,000 audiences over two days. Even though the shows were hit by a typhoon and it rained very hard, they still managed to attract thousands of attendees.

After the Nagisa-en performance, B&#x27;z flew back to the US. The tour &quot;B&#x27;z Live-Gym 2003 &#x27;Banzai in North America&#x27;&quot; included 7 shows, including stops at Las Vegas, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, and Vancouver. Their thirteenth album, &quot;Big Machine&quot;, was released on September 17. When they flew back to Japan, B&#x27;z started their third tour in 2003, &quot;B&#x27;z Live-Gym 2003 &#x27;Big Machine&#x27;&quot;. It was a dome tour in 6 locations, from Saitama Super Arena to Tokyo Dome in December. Tak Matsumoto&#x27;s cover album, &quot;The Hit Parade&quot;, with various vocalists, including Inaba, was released on November 26.

Kicking off 2004, B&#x27;z went back to the studio to begin recording again. On February 25, a DVD, &quot;Typhoon No.15 ~B&#x27;z Live-Gym The Final Pleasure &quot;It&#x27;s Showtime!!&quot; in Nagisaen~&quot;, was released. For the rest of the year, they worked mainly on their solo projects. Soon after finishing each solo tour, they began recording together again. On April 6, 2005, B&#x27;z released their fourteenth album, &quot;The Circle&quot;. For the album&#x27;s recording, the duo was particularly worried about its live sound. For promotional activities, B&#x27;z started the tour &quot;B&#x27;z Live-Gym 2005 &#x27;Circle of Rock&#x27;&quot; that ran from April to September, totaling 27 shows in 41 locations. On August 1, the compilation &quot;The Complete B&#x27;z&quot; was digitally released only for the Japanese iTunes Store in order to promote the iTunes Store in Japan, which included a Japanese cover of Maroon 5&#x27;s &quot;This Love&quot; as a bonus. Matsumoto&#x27;s House of Strings label, which he established a year before, released its second album, &quot;Theatre of Strings&quot;, on October 19. On November 30, &quot;B&#x27;z The Best &quot;Pleasure II&quot;&quot;, their third compilation album, was released, reaching one million sales by the end of 2005. On June 28, 2006, their fifteenth album, &quot;Monster&quot;, was released. Most of the recording took place in Los Angeles. B&#x27;z kicked off the tour &quot;B&#x27;z Live-Gym 2006 &#x27;Monster&#x27;s Garage&#x27;&quot; at the Amami Bunka Center on July 2, having 17 shows in all, including 5 big domes in 11 locations and 450,000 audience members altogether.

On November 19, 2007, B&#x27;z was inducted into Hollywood&#x27;s RockWalk as the first Asian inductee in Sunset Boulevard, California, United States. They were recommended by Steve Vai, whom they collaborated with in 1999 on the track &quot;Asian Sky&quot; from his album &quot;The Ultra Zone&quot;, as well as supported him during his 2007 tour in Japan. Shortly after, on December 5, B&#x27;z released their sixteenth album, &quot;Action&quot;. The drum parts for the two singles from &quot;Action&quot;, &quot;Eien no Tsubasa&quot; and &quot;Super Love Song&quot;, were recorded by drummers Josh Freese and Jeremy Colson, respectively.

=== 20th anniversary (2008–2009) ===
In February 2008, B&#x27;z released a DVD titled &quot;B&#x27;z Live in Nanba&quot;. The show was recorded in 2006 and was also broadcast online. The concert featured songs from &quot;The Circle&quot; and &quot;Monster&quot; eras, along with a number of older hits as well as several English versions. On April 16, 2008, the band released their forty-fifth single, &quot;Burn -Fumetsu no Face-&quot;, which became their forty-first consecutive No. 1 single. The year also marked the twentieth anniversary of the band. To commemorate the occasion, the &quot;B&#x27;z 20&quot; campaign was launched that saw two further compilation albums: &quot;B&#x27;z The Best &quot;Ultra Pleasure&quot;&quot; was released on June 18, 2008, and featured the greatest of the band&#x27;s hits on a two-disc collection in chronological order, along with two all-new modern recordings of older tracks, while &quot;B&#x27;z The Best &quot;Ultra Treasure&quot;&quot; was released on September 17, 2008, whose two-disc track listing was decided by fans who were invited to vote for three songs of their choice at the B&#x27;z 20th anniversary website, which featured an exclusive song on a three-disc gift bundle, as well as a re-recording and a remix.

On January 25, 2008, B&#x27;z performed &quot;B&#x27;z Showcase 2008 -Kiyotake Action-&quot;, a performance in their &quot;Showcase&quot; series of tours, which are generally small-venue performances of older album songs and more obscure B-sides that are mostly unsuitable for the larger arena concerts. Following this, B&#x27;z immediately embarked on the eight-month &quot;B&#x27;z Live-Gym 2008 &#x27;Action&#x27;&quot; tour, which saw them perform all over Japan. Afterward, they segued into &quot;B&#x27;z Live-Gym Pleasure 2008 -Glory Days-&quot;, their first &quot;Pleasure&quot; tour since 2003. Throughout the month of September, B&#x27;z performed for hundreds of thousands of fans in nine performances across three cities. The special tour ended on September 21 at Nissan Stadium, with a concert on the 20th anniversary of their first release. This performance was later released on DVD on February 25, 2009, as &quot;B&#x27;z Live-Gym Pleasure 2008 -Glory Days-&quot;.
Following their massive tour in 2008, B&#x27;z returned to the studio to record new material. Their first release of the year was a Double A-side single, &quot;Ichibu to Zenbu/Dive&quot;, released on August 5, 2009, which featured drummer Chad Smith. The non-full-track ringtone downloads (&quot;Chaku Uta&quot;) of &quot;Ichibu to Zenbu&quot; began on July 13, 2009, and the full-track ringtone downloads (&quot;Chaku Uta Full&quot;) of the song began on August 26, 2009. Because of its strong download sales in August and September on Recochoku, the song won the &quot;Monthly Recochoku Award, Best Song Award Grand Prix&quot; for &quot;Chaku Uta&quot; and &quot;Chaku Uta Full&quot; each for two consecutive months. On October 13, 2009, KDDI also announced that &quot;Ichibu to Zenbu&quot; was awarded the &quot;Utatomo Award&quot; of September 2009 for the sales on &quot;Utatomo&quot; via au&#x27;s LISMO. The second release was the single &quot;My Lonely Town&quot;, released on October 14, 2009. Both singles are featured in the band&#x27;s next studio album, &quot;Magic&quot;, released on November 18, 2009. On December 10, 2009, it was announced that their single &quot;Ichibu to Zenbu/Dive&quot; won the &quot;Hot 100 of the Year&quot; award at the Billboard Japan Music Awards.

=== 30th anniversary (2010–present) ===
After the &quot;B&#x27;z Live-Gym 2010 &#x27;Ain&#x27;t No Magic&#x27;&quot; tour, Inaba and Matsumoto worked on solo activities and did not release any single as a duo in 2010. Matsumoto released the album &quot;Take Your Pick&quot; with Larry Carlton on June 2, 2010, which later won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Album at the 53rd Grammy Awards on February 13, 2011. Inaba&#x27;s fourth solo studio album, &quot;Hadou&quot;, was also released on August 18, 2010, debuting at number one on the Oricon album charts.

In 2011, they came back as B&#x27;z with their forty-eighth single, &quot;Sayonara Kizu Darake no Hibi yo&quot;, which was written for and used as a commercial song for Pepsi NEX. They released their eighteenth studio album, &quot;C&#x27;mon&quot;, on July 27, 2011, which also featured their forty-ninth single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Wanna Lie&quot;, which was used as the ending theme in &quot;Detective Conan: Quarter of Silence&quot;. In the summer of 2011, B&#x27;z embarked on their third North American tour, &quot;B&#x27;z Live-Gym 2011 -Long Time No See-&quot;, which featured shows in Vancouver, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. On May 4, 2012, they released two singles: &quot;Into Free-Dangan-&quot;, an English re-recording of &quot;Samayoeru Aoi Dangan&quot;, which was used as the theme song for the video game &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Dogma&quot;, and their fiftieth single, &quot;Go for It, Baby (Kioku no Sanmyaku)&quot;. &quot;Into Free&quot; was later revealed as the lead single for their new English EP, titled &quot;B&#x27;z&quot;, which featured English re-recordings of &quot;Ai no Bakudan&quot;, &quot;Splash&quot;, &quot;Juice&quot;, and &quot;Ultra Soul&quot;. The songs were co-selected and co-written with their drummer, Shane Gaalaas. The EP was released internationally through the iTunes Store and was released on July 25, 2012. To support the EP, B&#x27;z embarked on their fourth North American tour, titled &quot;B&#x27;z Live-Gym 2012 -Into Free-&quot;, which included stops in San Francisco, Seattle, Vancouver, Toronto, Silver Spring, New York City, and Los Angeles. In an interview, Matsumoto explained, &quot;This will be our fourth US tour. We love playing for American audiences and are excited to share our first English-language release with our fans.&quot; The tour ended at the Universal Amphitheatre, which almost sold out.

In 2013, the group was the third highest-earning artist by total sales revenue in Japan with ¥5.379 billion. In 2015, they released their nineteenth studio album, &quot;Epic Day&quot;, as well the singles &quot;Uchōten&quot; and &quot;Red&quot;. In August 2017, the band released &quot;B&#x27;z Complete Single Box Set&quot;, and although being a high-priced limited edition, it managed to chart in the Top 10. B&#x27;z released their fifty-third single, &quot;Seimei/Still Alive&quot;, in June, which was their forty-ninth single to top the Oricon charts. Their twentieth studio album, &quot;Dinosaur&quot;, was released in November 2017, which was their twenty-eighth album to top the Oricon Albums Chart. To commemorate their 30th anniversary in 2018, they held a large exhibition between April and June at the Yūrakuchō Infos building in Tokyo&#x27;s Chiyoda ward, their music documentary &quot;B&#x27;z 30th Year Exhibition &quot;Scenes&quot; 1988–2018&quot; was screened in theatres nationwide, all 20 studio albums released up to that point were mastered for release as LPs, a commemorative book, &quot;B&#x27;z The Chronicle&quot;, was released, and a new &quot;Pleasure&quot; tour, &quot;B&#x27;z Live-Gym Pleasure 2018 -Hinotori-&quot;, was held. In July, they released the video &quot;B&#x27;z Live-Gym 2017–2018 &quot;Live Dinosaur&quot;,&quot; which topped both DVD and Blu-ray charts, selling over 90 thousand copies in the first week. Their new track, &quot;Tsuwamono, Hashiru&quot;, was used for TV commercials for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, which was held in Japan.

On January 17, 2019, B&#x27;z was announced as the first, and so far only, Japanese headliner for Japan&#x27;s Summer Sonic festival in its twenty-year history. The band previously played the festival in 2007, 2009, and with Aerosmith during a special event, dubbed &quot;Aerosonic&quot;, in 2013. On April 10, the band announced their long-awaited follow-up to &quot;Dinosaur,&quot; &quot;New Love.&quot; The album was released on May 29, 2019, and featured new backing band members who made their debut on that year&#x27;s &quot;B&#x27;z Live Gym 2019 -Whole Lotta New Love-&quot; tour, as well as a guest appearance by Aerosmith&#x27;s Joe Perry on &quot;Rain &amp; Dream&quot;.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, B&#x27;z made their entire Live-Gym catalog available to watch on YouTube for free, including their most recent one, &quot;Whole Lotta New Love&quot;, for a limited time&quot;.&quot;

B&#x27;z covered &quot;Sexual Violet No. 1&quot; by Masahiro Kuwana for 2021&#x27;s &quot;Take Me to Kazemachi!&quot;, a tribute album to the song&#x27;s lyricist, Takashi Matsumoto.

On May 21, 2021, the majority of the B&#x27;z catalog was made available on online music services, such as Spotify and Apple Music, worldwide. Previously, only the band&#x27;s 2007 and 2012 self-titled EPs were available on the iTunes Store internationally (though, currently, only the latter is available). A new song was also released, titled &quot;Kimi to Nara&quot;. Later, on December 8, they released their first mini-album in 25 years, &quot;Friends III&quot;.

On August 10, 2022, B&#x27;z released their twenty-second album, &quot;Highway X&quot;.

== Music style ==

The band&#x27;s music is composed by guitarist Tak Matsumoto, while the lyrics are written by vocalist Koshi Inaba. The band has experimented with its style, &quot;going from dance-rock to hard rock to blues to J-pop and back,&quot; according to AllMusic. They have also been described as an &quot;ultra-commercial blend of hard rock, blues, and synthesizer pop.&quot; Despite frequent changes in musical style during their first 13 years, they didn&#x27;t lose any support. In a review of their best-selling album, &quot;B&#x27;z The Best &quot;Ultra Pleasure&quot;&quot;, Adam Greenberg of AllMusic notes that they &quot;had some criticism as being more of a pop band with a rock tinge than a full-fledged rock band&quot;, but throughout their career, they&#x27;ve shown strong rock elements including &quot;&#x27;80s-styled extended electric guitar solo&quot; and &quot;blues-based rock&quot; with various Western rock influences combined with their distinctive style. Compared to two other big Japanese rock bands, Mr. Children and Glay, the sound of the former can be described as &quot;soft&quot;, while the latter is &quot;fast and rocking&quot;, which is more comparable to B&#x27;z. On &quot;Magic&quot;, for example, they have combined &quot;happy-go-lucky moods and hard rock aesthetics&quot;, but instead of sounding like Western glam metal, it&#x27;s more similar to a visual kei sound, indicating their influence on that movement and bands like L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel. Greenberg, in a review of &quot;Ichibu to Zenbu/Dive&quot;, argued that most of their work has a &quot;somewhat disjointed structure&quot;, &quot;creative vocal descents and cascades&quot;, and &quot;riff-heavy guitars&quot;. Marty Friedman compared them to Aerosmith, but stated to prefer B&#x27;z because of Inaba&#x27;s type of voice and high vocal technique, and Matsumoto&#x27;s personality while playing the guitar solo. Matsumoto&#x27;s guitar skills have been praised as the &quot;top guitar master in Asia&quot;, with &quot;fretboard histrionics&quot; and a &quot;great sense of riff&quot;.

== Influence and legacy ==
It is considered that Matsumoto&#x27;s guitar style has been influenced by the hard rock sound of Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple, while Inaba, who was interested in rock music since elementary school, listened to Queen, Loudness, Aerosmith, and others.

In 2003, HMV Japan ranked the band at number 30 on their list of the 100 most important Japanese pop acts. In 2007, B&#x27;z became the first music act from Asia to have their handprints and signatures put up on Hollywood&#x27;s RockWalk. According to AllMusic, they are considered the &quot;biggest rock act in Japan and the entirety of Asia&quot;, while the popular music historian Norman Abjorensen described them as one of the most notable J-pop music acts who have achieved Asian and global fame.

Matsumoto, through his B&#x27;z fame, is also credited for a &quot;resurrection and reinvention of the Japanese guitar hero&quot;, alongside, and in comparison to, X Japan&#x27;s guitarist Hide for a model of guitarist more interested in technique, technology, and equipment, popularizing the electric guitar as a mass media product in Japan. He also has numerous Gibson signature models, with the first one being released in 1999.

In Oricon&#x27;s yearly poll of 20,000 people for &quot;Favorite Artist Ranking&quot;, which started in 2004, they were regularly placed among the most popular music artists, even in more recent years being ranked at number 4 (2015, 2016, 2017). In 2015, in a survey by Oricon about peoples&#x27; favorite song to relieve stress, their song &quot;Ultra Soul&quot; was ranked second.

== Awards and achievements ==
In 2015, B&#x27;z had 35,809,000 reported certified single sales, for which they held the first place until December 2015. In 2017, they had 46,576,000 reported certified album sales, for which they still hold the first place. With joint sales of more than 86 million certified records, they are ranked as the best-selling music act in Japan. In 2008, for their 20th anniversary, they were awarded a &quot;Guinness World Record&quot; for &quot;Best-selling album act in Japan&quot;, which also notes them to be the best-selling act in Japan overall.

They have 25 Platinum and 31 Million physical album certifications, 9 Gold, 33 Platinum, and 20 Million physical single certifications, and 11 Gold physical home video certifications by the Recording Industry Association of Japan. The compilation album &quot;B&#x27;z The Best &quot;Pleasure&quot;&quot; was the first Japanese album to sell more than 5 million copies and was the best-selling album in Japan at the time, which has achieved by the end of 1998, but it was surpassed by Hikaru Utada&#x27;s &quot;First Love&quot; shortly after in 1999.

Other sales records held by B&#x27;z include &quot;the most number one singles (49), most consecutive number one singles (49), longest streak of number one singles (49), total weeks singles were at number one (66), longest consecutive period with a single at number one (20 Years), most singles in the top 10 concurrently (9), the most million-selling albums (19), most number-one albums (26), and the only artist in history to lead all six major categories tracked by Oricon&quot; among others, including total CD shipments of over 100 million copies. During the week of April 12, 2003, they held eleven positions in the top twelve on the Oricon Singles Chart, except for the second position.

In 1999, at the World Music Awards, they won the award for &quot;World&#x27;s Best-Selling Japanese Artist of the Year&quot;. At the WMA, they&#x27;ve received several nominations, including &quot;World&#x27;s Best Live Act&quot; and &quot;World&#x27;s Best Group&quot; in 2013.

<text>Antoine Arnauld (; 6 February 16128 August 1694) was a French Catholic theologian, priest, philosopher and mathematician. He was one of the leading intellectuals of the Jansenist group of Port-Royal and had a very thorough knowledge of patristics. Contemporaries called him &quot;le Grand&quot; to distinguish him from his father.

==Biography==
Antoine Arnauld was born in Paris to the Arnauld family. The twentieth and youngest child of the original Antoine Arnauld, he was originally intended for the bar, but decided instead to study theology at the Sorbonne. Here he was brilliantly successful, and his career was flourishing when he came under the influence of Jean du Vergier de Hauranne, the spiritual director and leader of the convent of Port-Royal, and was drawn in the direction of Jansenism.

His book, &quot;De la fréquente Communion&quot; (1643), was an important step in making the aims and ideals of this movement intelligible to the general public. It attracted controversy by being against frequent communion. Furthermore, in the frame of the controversy around Jansenius&#x27; &quot;Augustinus&quot;, during which the Jesuits attacked the Jansenists claiming they were heretics similar to Calvinists, Arnauld wrote in defense the &quot;Théologie morale des Jésuites&quot; (Moral Theology of Jesuits), which would put the base of most of the arguments later used by Pascal in his &quot;Provincial Letters&quot; denouncing the &quot;relaxed moral&quot; of Jesuit casuistry. Pascal was assisted in this task by Arnauld&#x27;s nephew Antoine Le Maistre. The Jesuit Nicolas Caussin, former penitentiary to Louis XIII, was charged by his order of writing a defense against Arnauld&#x27;s book, titled &quot;Réponse au libelle intitulé La Théologie morale des Jésuites&quot; (1644). Other libels published against Arnauld&#x27;s &quot;Moral Theology of Jesuits&quot; included the one written by the Jesuit polemist François Pinthereau (1605–1664), under the pseudonym of the abbé de Boisic, titled &quot;Les Impostures et les ignorances du libelle intitulé: La Théologie Morale des Jésuites&quot; (1644), who was also the author of a critical history of Jansenism titled &quot;La Naissance du Jansénisme découverte à Monsieur le Chancelier&quot; (The Birth of Jansenism Revealed to Sir the Chancellor, Leuven, 1654).

During the formulary controversy which opposed Jesuits to Jansenists concerning the orthodoxy of Jansenius&#x27; propositions, Arnauld was forced to go into hiding. In 1655 two very outspoken &quot;Lettres à un duc et pair&quot; on Jesuit methods in the confessional brought a motion of censorship voted against him in the Sorbonne, in quite an irregular manner. This motion prompted Pascal to anonymously write the &quot;Provincial Letters&quot;. For more than twenty years Arnauld dared not appear publicly in Paris, hiding in religious retreat.

Pascal, however, failed to save his friend, and in February 1656 Arnauld was ceremonially degraded. Twelve years later the so-called &quot;peace&quot; of Pope Clement IX put an end to his troubles; he was graciously received by Louis XIV, and treated almost as a popular hero.

He now set to work with Pierre Nicole on a great work against the Calvinist Protestants: &quot;La perpétuité de la foi de l&#x27;Église catholique touchant l&#x27;eucharistie&quot;. Ten years later, however, persecution resumed. Arnauld was compelled to leave France for the Netherlands, finally settling down at Brussels. Here the last sixteen years of his life were spent in incessant controversy with Jesuits, Calvinists and heretics of all kinds. Arnauld gradually evolved away from the rigorous Augustinianism professed by Port-Royal and closer to Thomism, which also postulated the centrality of the &quot;efficacious grace,&quot; under the influence of Nicole.

His inexhaustible energy is best expressed by his famous reply to Nicole, who complained of feeling tired. &quot;Tired!&quot; echoed Arnauld, &quot;when you have all eternity to rest in?&quot; His energy was not exhausted by purely theological questions. He was one of the first to adopt the philosophy of René Descartes, though with certain orthodox reservations relating to &quot;Meditations on First Philosophy&quot;; and between 1683 and 1685 he had a long battle with Nicolas Malebranche on the relation of theology to metaphysics. On the whole, public opinion leant to Arnauld&#x27;s side. When Malebranche complained that his adversary had misunderstood him, Boileau silenced him with the question: &quot;My dear sir, whom do you expect to understand you, if M. Arnauld does not?&quot; Next Arnauld was engaged in an extensive correspondence with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, regarding the latter&#x27;s views detailed in his &quot;Discourse on Metaphysics&quot; (1686). Arnauld died, aged 82, in Brussels.

Popular record for Arnauld&#x27;s penetration was much increased in his &quot;L&#x27;Art de penser&quot;, commonly known as the &quot;Port-Royal Logic&quot;, which kept its place as an elementary text-book until the 20th century and is considered a paradigmatical work of term logic.

Arnauld came to be regarded as important among the mathematicians of his time; one critic described him as the Euclid of the 17th century. After his death, his reputation began to wane. Contemporaries admired him as a master of intricate reasoning; on this, Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet, the greatest theologian of the age, agreed with Henri François d&#x27;Aguesseau, the greatest lawyer. However, his eagerness to win every argument endeared him to no one. &quot;In spite of myself,&quot; Arnauld once said regretfully, &quot;my books are seldom very short.&quot; . Despite Arnauld&#x27;s achievements in various fields, his name is mostly known because of Pascal&#x27;s acclaimed writings, which were more fit for the general public than Arnauld&#x27;s technical essays. Boileau wrote for him a famous epitaph, consecrating his memory as

“Au pied de cet autel de structure grossière
 Gît sans pompe, enfermé dans une vile bière,
 Le plus savant mortel qui jamais ait écrit;”
(“At the foot of this rough structure altar
Lies without pomp, locked in a vile casket,
The most learned mortal who ever wrote;”)


Antoine Arnauld&#x27;s complete works (thirty-seven volumes in forty-two parts) were published in Paris, 1775–1781. There is a study of his philosophy in Francisque Bouillier, &quot;Histoire de la philosophie cartésienne&quot; (Paris, 1868); and his mathematical achievements are discussed by Franz Bopp in the 14th volume of the &quot;Abhandlung zur Geschichte der mathematischen Wissenschaften&quot; (Leipzig, 1902).

<text>Pierre Nicole (; 19 October 1625 – 16 November 1695) was a French writer and one of the most distinguished of the French Jansenists.

== Life ==
Born in Chartres in 1625, Nicole was the son of a provincial barrister, who took in charge his education. Sent to Paris in 1642 to study theology, he soon entered into relations with the Jansenist community at Port-Royal through his aunt, Marie des Anges Suireau, who was for a short time abbess of the convent, and he taught for a while at the Petites écoles de Port-Royal. Some scruple of conscience forbade him to proceed to the priesthood, and he remained throughout life a &quot;clerk in minor orders,&quot; although a profound theological scholar. For some years he was a master in the &quot;little school&quot; for boys established at Port Royal, and had the honour of teaching Greek to young Jean Racine, the future poet. But his chief duty was to act, in collaboration with Antoine Arnauld, as general editor of the controversial literature put forth by the Jansenists.

He had a large share in collecting the materials for Pascal&#x27;s &quot;Provincial Letters&quot; (1656); in 1658 he translated the &quot;Letters&quot; into Latin, under the pseudonym of Nicholas Wendrock. In 1662 he coauthored the very successful &quot;Port-Royal Logic&quot; with Antoine Arnauld, based on a Cartesian reading of Aristotelian logic. In 1664 he himself began a series of letters, &quot;Les Imaginaires&quot;, intended to show that the heretical opinions commonly ascribed to the Jansenists really existed only in the imagination of the Jesuits. His letters being violently attacked by Desmarets de Saint-Sorlin, an erratic minor poet who professed great devotion to the Jesuits, Nicole replied to him in another series of letters, &quot;Les Visionnaires&quot; (1666). In the course of these he observed that poets and dramatists were no better than &quot;public poisoners.&quot; This remark stung Racine to the quick; he turned not only on his old master, but on all Port Royal, in a scathing reply, which—as Boileau told him—did more honour to his head than to his heart.

About the same time Nicole became involved in a controversy about transubstantiation with the Huguenot Claude; out of this grew a massive work, &quot;La Perpétuité de la foi de l&#x27;Église catholique touchant l&#x27;eucharistie&quot; (1669), the joint effort of Nicole and Antoine Arnauld. But Nicole&#x27;s most popular production was his &quot;Essais de morale&quot;, a series of short discussions on practical Christianity. The first volume was published in 1671, and was followed at irregular intervals by others; altogether the series numbers fourteen volumes. In 1679, on the renewal of the persecution of the Jansenists, Nicole was forced to flee to Belgium in company with Arnauld. But the two soon parted. Nicole was elderly and in poor health; the life of a fugitive was not to his taste, and he complained that he wanted rest. &quot;Rest,&quot; answered Arnauld, &quot;when you have eternity to rest in!&quot; In 1683 Nicole made a rather ambiguous peace with the authorities and was allowed to come back to Paris. There he continued his literary labours up to the last; he was writing a refutation of the new heresy of the Quietists, when death overtook him.

He died in Paris in 1695.

Nicole was one of the most attractive figures of Port Royal. Many stories are told of his quaint absent-mindedness and unreadiness in conversation. His books are distinguished by exactly opposite qualities; they are neat and orderly to excess. Hence they were exceedingly popular with Mme de Sevigné and readers of her class. No other Jansenist writer, not even Pascal, was so successful in putting the position of Port Royal before the world. 

Several abridgments of the work exist, notably a &quot;Choix des essais de morale de Nicole&quot;, ed. Silvestre de Saci (Paris, 1857). Nicole&#x27;s life is told at length in the 4th volume of Sainte-Beuve&#x27;s &quot;Port-Royal&quot;.

<doc id="228445" wikidata="Q462050" url="?curid=228445" title="Sacheen Littlefeather">
<text>Maria Louise Cruz (November 14, 1946 – October 2, 2022), better known as Sacheen Littlefeather, was an American-born actress and activist for Native American civil rights. After her death, she was accused by family members and journalists of falsely claiming Native American heritage.

Littlefeather represented Marlon Brando at the 45th Academy Awards (better known as the Oscars) in 1973, where on Brando&#x27;s declined the Best Actor award that he won for his performance in &quot;The Godfather&quot;. The favorite to win, Brando boycotted the ceremony as a protest against Hollywood&#x27;s portrayal of Native Americans and to draw attention to the standoff at Wounded Knee. During her speech, the audience&#x27;s response to Brando&#x27;s boycotting was divided between booing and applause.

After the Academy Awards speech, Littlefeather worked in hospice care. She continued her activism for Native American issues including healthcare and unemployment, and produced films about Native Americans. In June 2022, the Academy sent Littlefeather a statement of apology that was read in full at &quot;An Evening with Sacheen Littlefeather&quot; on September 17, two weeks before her death.

Littlefeather said her father was of Apache and Yaqui ancestry and her mother was of European descent. Shortly after Littlefeather&#x27;s death, Navajo writer and activist Jacqueline Keeler interviewed Littlefeather&#x27;s two sisters, who said that their family is not Native American and that Littlefeather fabricated her Native American ancestry. They also said that their father, who was born in Oxnard, California, was of Spanish-Mexican descent and had no tribal ties.

==Early life==
Littlefeather was born Marie Louise Cruz or Maria Louise Cruz on November 14, 1946, in Salinas, California. Her mother, Geroldine Marie Cruz (née Barnitz), was a leather stamper of French, German, and Dutch descent, and was born and raised in Santa Barbara, California. Littlefeather&#x27;s father was Manuel Ybarra Cruz, a saddlemaker of Mexican descent who was born and raised in Oxnard, California.

Littlefeather repeatedly claimed that her father had White Mountain Apache and Yaqui ancestry. However, her sisters, as well as researchers who have looked into the claim, confirm that he was of Spanish-Mexican ancestry with no known ancestors who had a tribal identity in Mexico, and he had no connection to the Yaqui or White Mountain Apache tribes of Arizona. 

Both Geroldine and Manuel were saddlemakers. Geroldine learned the craft from Leo Leonard, who owned Leonard Saddle Company in Santa Barbara, and Manuel learned to make saddles as a boy in San Francisco. By 1949, they had moved to Salinas and opened up their own business, Cruz Saddlery. Geroldine Cruz continued to operate the business after her husband&#x27;s death in 1966.

Littlefeather attended North Salinas High School from 1960 to 1964 and was active in 4-H, winning awards in home economics categories such as food preservation and fashion. After high school, she attended Hartnell Junior College and studied elementary education.

Littlefeather said that around age 19, she spent a year in a psychiatric hospital after previously hearing voices that pushed her to a suicide attempt, recounting what happened during a three-hour visual history interview in 2022 with the director of the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures. According to Littlefeather, the institution was a &quot;hell hole&quot; and doctors used what she said was &quot;psychodrama&quot; role-playing her parents &quot;while black-hooded figures listened in a dim-lit room&quot; to help her &quot;reconstruct memories of childhood abuse and abandonment.&quot; Littlefeather said she was diagnosed with schizophrenia. In 1969, she moved to the San Francisco Bay Area to pursue a modeling career, with a portfolio of photos taken by Kenneth Cook of Cook&#x27;s Photography. She said she had been treated with thorazine and other medications but &quot;mostly stabilized with much help&quot; from the San Francisco Bay Area Native American community.

While she attended California State College at Hayward (now California State University, East Bay) and studied dramatics and speech, she continued to cultivate a Native American identity. In 1969, she joined the United Bay Indian Council. She claimed to have participated part-time in the occupation of Alcatraz in 1970, though this claim has been disputed. Around this time, she adopted the name Sacheen Littlefeather. She said she chose the name Sacheen because that was the name her father called her before he died, and Littlefeather came from the feather she always wore in her hair. She learned more about Native American customs from elders and other protesters, such as Adam Fortunate Eagle (then known as Adam Nordwall). In an interview after her Academy Awards appearance, Fortunate Eagle confirmed that Littlefeather had supported the protest at Alcatraz; however, according to an article published after Littlefeather&#x27;s death, activist LaNada War Jack, who was at Alcatraz, said Littlefeather was not there.

In 1974, Littlefeather attended classes at the American Conservatory Theater, studying acting, yoga, fencing, Shakespeare, dancing, and other various skills for her acting career. She played the role of Paleflower in &quot;Winterhawk&quot;, filmed in Kalispell, Montana.

===Accounts of abusive childhood===
In interviews, Littlefeather said she had a difficult childhood. In a 1974 interview, she stated that her mother left her father when she was four and took her to live with her maternal grandparents. In 1988, she stated that her parents lived next door to her maternal grandparents, Marie and Gerold &quot;Barney&quot; Barnitz, while she and her two younger sisters lived with those grandparents. She characterized this as either being &quot;adopted&quot;, or in foster care. During a 1976 television interview, she described her father as abusive. She said her mother and two sisters were subject to their father&#x27;s rage and beatings.

In an opinion piece following her death, Navajo writer and activist Jacqueline Keeler wrote that Littlefeather&#x27;s sisters disputed that their father had been abusive and that Littlefeather&#x27;s account of her childhood seemed to have been taken from that of her father, who had grown up in poverty and whose own father was abusive.

==Early career==
Aspiring to become an actress, Littlefeather picked up several radio and television commercial credits and joined the Screen Actors Guild. She later said that she &quot;learned early in life that there was probably a place for me in the dramatic art field, acting ... if you have a parent who&#x27;s deaf, you naturally have to act out messages to them&quot;, referring to communicating with her father. In 1970, as &quot;Sacheen Littlefeather of Alcatraz&quot;, she was named Miss Vampire USA, a promotion for &quot;House of Dark Shadows&quot;.

While living in the San Francisco Bay area in the early 1970s, Littlefeather participated in the 1971 American Indian Festival at Foothill College, judged a local 1972 beauty pageant as &quot;Princess Littlefeather&quot;, and organized a 1972 American Indian Festival at the Palace of Fine Arts. She worked at a radio station, KFRC, for about six months and did freelance reporting for PBS member station KQED.

&quot;Playboy&quot; magazine planned a spread called &quot;10 Little Indians&quot; in 1972, and one of the models was Littlefeather, but the spread was cancelled. A year later in October 1973, due to her Academy Award appearance fame, they ran the photographs of Littlefeather as a stand-alone feature. Littlefeather was personally criticized for what was seen as exploitation of her fame, but she explained that it was &quot;strictly a business agreement&quot; to earn the money needed to attend the World Theater Festival in Nancy, France. Looking back at the photo shoot, Littlefeather later said, &quot;I was young and dumb.&quot;

In January 1973, she appeared in &quot;Make-up for Minority Women&#x27; and was identified as a professional model. As a spokesperson for the National American Indian Council, she protested President Richard Nixon&#x27;s budget cuts to federal Indian programs in February 1973. On March 6, 1973, she participated in a meeting between the Federal Communications Commission and members of several minority groups about the representation of minorities on television. In an interview published just before her Academy Awards appearance, she stated that she had helped send two Indian nurses to Wounded Knee and that she had relinquished her United States citizenship, along with seven Native Americans.

In 1975, Littlefeather reported that she was working on a movie script about Edward S. Curtis with Cap Weinberger, Jr, who had written an article about Curtis for &quot;Smithsonian&quot; magazine. She emceed an evening performance at the United National Indian Tribal Youth conference in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, in 1976. She continued to pursue acting opportunities, such as touring with the &quot;Red Earth Theater Company&quot;.

==1973 Academy Awards speech==
===Background===

Accounts of how Littlefeather initially met Marlon Brando vary. In one of her first interviews after the speech, she mentioned that they met &quot;through his interest in the Indian movement&quot;. An account from the night of the Oscar ceremony describes Francis Ford Coppola observing Littlefeather on a TV monitor backstage and stating &quot;Sacheen Littlefeather. She lives in San Francisco. She&#x27;s a friend of mine that I introduced to B ... She&#x27;s an Indian princess.&quot;

A 1974 article about a Littlefeather interview stated that she was working for a San Francisco radio station when she applied for work with Coppola and that he then referred her to Brando, &quot;knowing Brando&#x27;s interest in the Indian&quot;. At the time of the Oscars, she had known Brando for nearly a year. Later accounts describe Coppola as Littlefeather&#x27;s neighbor in San Francisco.

In a 2021 interview, Littlefeather said that she got to know Coppola while hiking the hills of San Francisco and she got Brando&#x27;s address from him. Subsequently, she wrote Brando a letter, asking about his interest in Native American issues. In that account, he called the radio station where she worked months after she sent the letter. Littlefeather also said that she met Brando in Washington, D.C., where she was presenting to the Federal Communications Commission about minorities.

In 1972, Brando played Vito Corleone in &quot;The Godfather&quot;, which many critics consider one of the greatest films of all time. For the performance he was nominated for Best Actor at the 45th Academy Awards, which were presented on March 27, 1973, at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles, California. Before the ceremony, Brando decided that—as the favorite to win—he would boycott as a protest led by AIM against the ongoing siege at Wounded Knee and his views on how Native Americans were represented in American films. He called Littlefeather and asked her to appear on his behalf. &quot;I was a spokesperson, so to speak, for the stereotype of Native Americans in film and television,&quot; she later said.

===Awards ceremony===
Littlefeather joined the audience minutes before the award for Best Actor was announced. She was accompanied by Brando&#x27;s secretary, Alice Marchak. She wore her long dark hair tied with Native-style beadwork, moccasins and a fringed and beaded buckskin dress. Producer Howard W. Koch, she later said, told her &quot;you can&#x27;t read all that&quot; in reference to the 739-word speech written by Brando, so she condensed it all into 60 seconds. In other retellings of that night, Littlefeather said Koch told her that she had 60 seconds to deliver the speech or else she would be removed from the stage and arrested. Koch recalled that he permitted her to stay and make her speech after she promised not to make a scene.

The Best Actor award was presented by Norwegian actress Liv Ullmann and British actor Roger Moore. After giving brief remarks and announcing the five nominees, they declared Brando as the winner. Littlefeather walked onto the stage and raised her hand to decline the Oscar trophy that Moore offered her. Deviating from the prepared speech, she said the following:

Moore escorted Littlefeather off-stage, past several people critical of her, and towards the press. Littlefeather stated in 2022 that some people mockingly used the tomahawk chop towards her as she was led by. Koch and director Marty Pasetta both later recalled that John Wayne was waiting in the wings and had to be restrained by six security guards to prevent him from forcing her off stage. This claim has since been disputed by film historian Farran Nehme and biographer Scott Eyman. At a later press conference, Littlefeather read to journalists the speech that Brando had prepared; &quot;The New York Times&quot; published the full text the next day.

The incident drew remarks from others at the same ceremony. Later that night, before she announced the Best Actress winner, Raquel Welch said, &quot;I hope the winner doesn&#x27;t have a cause.&quot; When Clint Eastwood began presenting the Best Picture award, he joked, &quot;I don&#x27;t know if I should present this award on behalf of all the cowboys shot in all the John Ford Westerns over the years.&quot; Michael Caine, the night&#x27;s co-host, criticized Brando for &quot;letting some poor little Indian girl take the boos&quot; instead of up and [doing] it himself&quot;.

===Reception and legacy===
The audience in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion was divided between applause and jeers. Brando and Littlefeather&#x27;s protest was generally considered inappropriate for the awards ceremony. &quot;I was distressed that people should have booed and whistled and stomped, even though perhaps it was directed at myself,&quot; Brando later told Dick Cavett. &quot;They should have at least had the courtesy to listen to her.&quot; Her appearance prompted the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to rule out future proxy acceptance of Academy Awards. (Oscars for winners unable to accept in person are now accepted on their behalf by the presenters.)

After giving the speech, Littlefeather spent two days in Los Angeles before returning to San Francisco. She later said that she visited Marlon Brando&#x27;s house after the Academy Awards and bullets were fired into his front door while they were talking.

According to Ann Brebner of the Brebner Agency, which handled Littlefeather&#x27;s modeling bookings, she was deluged with mail and phone calls after her Oscars appearance, which led to radio and television appearances as well as the opportunity to read for several film roles. In the years immediately following the protest, Littlefeather said that it had &quot;had little effect on the course of her career&quot;. Later, though, Littlefeather said she was blacklisted by the Hollywood community and received threats. She also said that media reports published several falsehoods, such as that she was not Native American or had rented the outfit for the occasion. She said that the federal government encouraged the blacklisting to abate Native American activism after Wounded Knee.

Littlefeather credited the speech with bringing attention back to the situation at Wounded Knee, though news coverage of the standoff at the time makes little mention of Littlefeather or Brando. Russell Means contended that &quot;Marlon Brando and Sacheen Littlefeather totally uplifted&quot; the lives of those at Wounded Knee. Actor Jay Silverheels, who played Tonto in &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; and later founded the Indian Actors Workshop, commented that he did not think Littlefeather&#x27;s appearance at the Oscars &quot;did any harm or any particular good. I knew Sacheen and I don&#x27;t think it was her idea at all—I am sure Brando recruited her&quot;.

At The Comedy Awards in 2012, comedian Norm Macdonald staged a parody of the speech in accepting an award on behalf of Melissa McCarthy.

Coretta Scott King commended Brando for his non-violent stand, stating, &quot;It is gratifying to see people in entertainment increasingly concerned about injustices in society and not just interested in making money.&quot; Many years later, Littlefeather said that King called her to thank her for the speech. In 2016, the 88th ceremony of the Academy Awards drew criticism for lack of diversity in nominations; actress Jada Pinkett Smith, who boycotted the ceremony, cited Littlefeather as inspiration to do so.

In June 2022, the Academy sent Littlefeather a statement of apology, in which the organization&#x27;s then-president David Rubin wrote: &quot;The abuse you endured because of this statement was unwarranted and unjustified. The emotional burden you have lived through and the cost to your own career in our industry are irreparable. For too long the courage you showed has been unacknowledged. For this, we offer both our deepest apologies and our sincere admiration.&quot; The statement was read in full at &quot;An Evening with Sacheen Littlefeather&quot; on September 17, an event honoring Littlefeather and featuring a conversation between her and producer Bird Runningwater, the co-chair of the Academy&#x27;s Indigenous Alliance. She also recorded an episode for the Academy Museum&#x27;s podcast and a visual history for the Academy Oral History Projects.

She described the Academy&#x27;s apology to her as &quot;a dream come true&quot;, and said that &quot;we Indians are very patient people—it&#x27;s only been 50 years!&quot; She added, &quot;We need to keep our sense of humor about this at all times. It&#x27;s our method of survival.&quot;

At the 95th Academy Awards ceremony in 2023, the Academy did not recognize Littlefeather during its in memoriam segment.

==Later career and activism==
Littlefeather was described as a founding member of the Red Earth Indian Theater Company in Seattle when awarded an Eagle Spirit Award (Honorary) at the 2013 American Indian Film Festival. Contemporary accounts of the founding of the Red Earth Performing Arts Company by Nez Perce actor and playwright John Kauffman, Jr in 1974 do not mention Littlefeather. In 1978, it was reported that Littlefeather would travel to Newfoundland with the Greenpeace Foundation to protest the Newfoundland seal hunt along with politicians and other show business personalities. She served as an advisor to PBS&#x27;s &quot;Dance in America: Song for Dead Warriors&quot; (1984), which earned its choreographer, Michael Smuin, an Emmy Award.

As a staff member of the American Indian Center, Littlefeather participated in a conference about American Indians in media at the Hotel San Franciscan in 1978. As the director of the First Nation Education Resource Center in San Francisco, Littlefeather commented on a letter from two American Indians in Oakland that was handed to Nelson Mandela, stating that the letter outlined problems facing American Indians, including healthcare and unemployment. The letter, signed by Betty Cooper, director of the American Indian alcoholism program, and Sally Gallegos, director of the Consortium of United Indian Nations, was credited with Mandela&#x27;s decision to meet with American Indian leaders in October 1990.

She continued doing activism and became a respected member of California&#x27;s Native American community. She played a role in the mascot change at Tamalpais High School in the late 1980s, first becoming involved when she visited the high school as a guest director for the drama class play, &quot;Grandmother Earth&quot;. She criticized the use of an Indian-themed mascot at Tomales High in 2001. In the 1980s, she led prayer circles for Kateri Tekakwitha, the first Native American Catholic saint.

A 1987 profile of Littlefeather stated that she was a recipient of the 1986 Traditional Indian Medicine Achievement Award for her participation in the Traditional Indian Medicine Program at St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital in Tucson, Arizona. Although St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital and Health Center did receive an Achievement Citation from the Catholic Health Association of the United States in 1986 for Traditional Indian Medicine&#x27;s Role in the Carondelet Health System, an article about the award only mentions the initiator of the program, Apache nurse Belinda Acosta, and the program coordinator, Ann Hubbert. Littlefeather also described herself as one of the original teachers in St. Mary&#x27;s Traditional Indian Medicine program, which consisted of a series of conferences held between 1984 and 1990 and was coordinated by Comanche medicine man Edgar Monetathchi, Jr, who worked for the Indian Health Service and was the first medicine man to be employed full-time by a Catholic hospital.

In 1988, she served as the secretary and community member-at-large on the interim board of directors of the American Indian AIDS Institute of San Francisco. Around this same time period, Littlefeather worked at the Gift of Love AIDS hospice in San Francisco, which was founded in 1988 by Mother Teresa, and had the opportunity to meet Mother Teresa during at least one of her five visits to the facility before her death in 1997. She campaigned against obesity, alcoholism, and diabetes, and specifically assisted Native Americans with AIDS. In 1990, it was reported that Littlefeather&#x27;s brother had died of AIDS. Obituaries for Littlefeather&#x27;s father and maternal grandmother do not mention a biological son in the family, only Littlefeather and her two younger sisters.

In a 1991 article, Littlefeather was credited with co-founding the American Indian Registry for Performing Arts. The registry was founded in the early 1980s by Muscogee actor Will Sampson, who worked with the American Native Association to publish a directory of American Indians in the arts and entertainment fields. Littlefeather reported in 1991 that she was working on two shows for PBS, &quot;Remember Me Forever&quot; and &quot;The Americas Before Columbus&quot;, both scheduled for broadcast in 1992. Littlefeather participated in events related to a year-long celebration of the Americas before Columbus, but there is no record of a PBS show by either name being broadcast in 1992. In 2009, she gave testimony in the documentary &quot;Reel Injun&quot; about Native Americans in film.

In 2015, Littlefeather reported that her name and image were being used fraudulently to raise money claimed to be for the Lakota nation. The money raised was never donated to any campaign.

In November 2019, she received the Brando Award, which recognizes individuals for their contributions to the American Indian, from the Red Nation International Film Festival. She participated in events commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Occupation of Alcatraz, including serving as head pow wow judge. Author Tommy Orange was commissioned by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art&#x27;s Open Space platform to write a piece called &quot;Dear Marlon Brando&quot; as part of the magazine &quot;Alcatraz Is Not an Island&quot;, commemorating the 50th anniversary. In the piece, a character from Orange&#x27;s novel &quot;There, There&quot; writes to Brando about what it meant to see Littlefeather at the Oscars.

==Personal life==
In 1973, Littlefeather was married to engineer Michael Rubio. She was later in a 32-year-long relationship with and married Charles Koshiway Johnston, who died in 2021.

Littlefeather studied orthomolecular nutrition and later said that she had &quot;wanted to see where all the &#x27;white&#x27; food came from&quot; so she went to Sweden and lived in Stockholm. She stated that she wanted to travel in Europe to &quot;see where the white people came from&quot; just as people are &quot;always going to reservations to see where the Indians came from&quot;. While traveling, she became interested in the food of other cultures and noted similarities between foods such as Spanish buñuelos and American Indian fry bread as well as Russian pirozhki and the meat pies made by her Kiowa friends.

===Health problems and death===
Over the years, Littlefeather described her personal experiences with serious health issues, including internal bleeding, collapsed lungs, and cancer. She reported having tuberculosis at age four and received treatment in an oxygen tent while hospitalized. She stated that she was suicidal and hospitalized in a mental institution for a year. In 1974, she stated that Marlon Brando sent her to a doctor when she was in a lot of pain and helped her recover, so she made the Oscar speech to repay him.

At the age of 29 her lungs collapsed. After recovering, she received a degree from Antioch University in holistic health and nutrition with an emphasis in Native American medicine, a practice she credited with her recovery. In 1991, Littlefeather was reported to be recovering from radical cancer surgery. A 1999 article stated she had developed colon cancer in the early 1990s.

In 2018, Littlefeather developed stage IV breast cancer, a recurrence of the breast cancer from which she was reported to be in remission in 2012. She said in a 2021 interview that the cancer had metastasized to her right lung and that she was terminal.

Littlefeather died at her home in Novato, California, on October 2, 2022, at the age of 75.

== Ancestry dispute ==
Following Littlefeather&#x27;s death, Navajo author Jacqueline Keeler interviewed Littlefeather&#x27;s biological sisters Rosalind Cruz and Trudy Orlandi, who say their family has no Native American ancestry. Keeler writes that the sisters state that their father, who was born in Oxnard, California, was of Mexican descent and had no tribal ties, nor was he related to the Yaqui tribes of Northern Mexico. Furthermore, Cruz believed Littlefeather fabricated a Native identity because she thought it was more &quot;prestigious&quot; to be Native American than to be Hispanic. Keeler searched records of Littlefeather&#x27;s family going back to 1850 and did not find evidence of Native ancestry. Although some of Cruz&#x27;s/Littlefeather&#x27;s distant family may have been born in Pima/O’odham tribal territory in Sonora, Mexico, scholars have stated that actual tribal members in these communities would have been a minority during the time. According to Liza Black, an associate professor of history and Native American and Indigenous studies at Indiana University, and a citizen of the Cherokee Nation, &quot;Keeler proves Littlefeather was a troubled woman who made the stories of others her own&quot;. The Pascua Yaqui Tribe stated that while neither Littlefeather nor her parents were enrolled tribal members, &quot;that does not mean that we could independently confirm that she is not of Yaqui ancestry generally, from Mexico or the Southwestern United States&quot;.

Roger Ebert had disputed Littlefeather&#x27;s Native American ethnicity in 2004 in an obituary for Marlon Brando, stating that after her attendance at the Oscars she was &quot;identified as Maria Cruz, an actress who was not an Indian&quot;. He subsequently published a letter received from Littlefeather&#x27;s lawyer, which asked him to clarify that Littlefeather was Native American, with a father who was &quot;Yaqui and White Mountain Apache&quot;. The lawyer&#x27;s letter claimed that Cruz was her married name. However, on her official website, a response to Ebert&#x27;s article contradicts the lawyer and states that she was born Maria Cruz. In the statement, Littlefeather continued to claim to be Yaqui and White Mountain Apache.

Because Littlefeather had been a prominent activist, these allegations caused mixed reactions. Academic and journalist Dina Gilio-Whitaker, who studies Native Americans in the US, wrote that the truth about community leaders is &quot;crucial&quot;, even if it means losing a &quot;hero&quot;, and that the work Littlefeather did is still valuable, but there is a need to be honest about the harm done by pretendians, especially by those who manage to fool so many people that they become iconic, as Littlefeather did. Gilio-Whitaker specified:

There have been calls for revisions or removal of the exhibition featuring a tribute to Littlefeather at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures and questions raised about &quot;the organization&#x27;s commitment to historical accuracy&quot;. Historians and activists say the allegations should &quot;prompt the Academy to investigate and determine whether it should amend its presentation of Littlefeather in its gallery spaces or in podcast and video interviews posted on its official channel&quot;. As the 50th anniversary of Littlefeather’s appearance at the Oscars neared, her sisters reiterated that Littlefeather had faked a Native American identity for all that time. In a February 2023 letter, Littlefeather&#x27;s sister Trudi Orlandi asked the Academy to remove the tribute from its museum gallery. , Orlandi had yet to receive a reply.

On March 6, 2024, newly publicized research indicated that the late activist may have had Indigenous Mexican roots, citing church records showing her great-great-grandfather was listed as &quot;Yaquis criollos de la tierra&quot; in 1815. Keeler stated that the wording does not necessarily imply indigenous origin, and that the family may have been Spanish migrants to Mexico.

<text>The Pontiac GTO is a front-engine, rear-drive, two-door and four-passenger automobile manufactured and marketed by the Pontiac division of General Motors over four generations from 1963 until 1974 in the United States — with a fifth generation made by GM&#x27;s Australian subsidiary, Holden, for the 2004 through 2006 model years.

The first generation of the GTO is credited with popularizing the muscle car market segment in the 1960s. Some consider the Pontiac GTO to have started the trend with all four domestic automakers offering a variety of competing models.

For the 1964 and 1965 model years, the GTO was an optional package on the intermediate-sized Pontiac LeMans. The 1964 GTO vehicle identification number (VIN) started with 22, while the 1965 GTO VIN started with 237. The GTO became a separate model from 1966 through 1971 (VIN 242...). It became an optional package again for the 1972 and 1973 intermediate LeMans. For 1974, the GTO was an optional trim package on the compact-sized Ventura.

The GTO model was revived from 2004 to 2006 model years as a captive import for Pontiac, a left-hand drive version of the Holden Monaro, itself a coupé variant of the Holden Commodore.

==Origins==
In early 1963, General Motors management banned divisions from involvement in auto racing. This followed the 1957 voluntary ban on automobile racing that was instituted by the Automobile Manufacturers Association. By the early 1960s, Pontiac&#x27;s advertising and marketing approach was heavily based on performance. With GM&#x27;s ban on factory-sponsored racing, Pontiac&#x27;s managers began to emphasize street performance.

In his autobiography &quot;Glory Days&quot;, Pontiac chief marketing manager Jim Wangers, who worked for the division&#x27;s contract advertising and public relations agency, states that John DeLorean, Bill Collins, and Russ Gee were responsible for the GTO&#x27;s creation. It involved transforming the upcoming second-generation Pontiac Tempest (which reverted to a conventional front-engine with front transmission configuration) into a sporty car, with a larger Pontiac V8 engine from the full-sized Pontiac Grand Prix hardtop coupe in place of the standard V8. By promoting the big-engine option as a special high-performance model, they could appeal to the youth market (which had also been recognized by Ford Motor Company&#x27;s Lee Iacocca, who was at that time preparing the Ford Mustang variant of the second generation Ford Falcon compact).

The GTO disregarded GM&#x27;s policy limiting the A-body intermediate line to a maximum engine displacement of . The development team discovered a loophole in the policy that did not restrict the offering of large engines as an option. Pontiac general manager Elliot &quot;Pete&quot; Estes approved the new model with sales manager Frank Bridge limiting initial production to 5,000 cars.

=== FIA Homologation ===
The name, &quot;GTO&quot; was inspired by the Ferrari 250 GTO. The moniker is an Italian abbreviation for &quot;Gran Turismo Omologato&quot; (&quot;grand tourer homologated&quot;), designating being certified by the FIA for racing in the grand tourer class as a production car with at least a hundred units made.

Unusually for such a Detroit marketing ploy, a Pontiac employee had the car homologated by the FIA in 1964, so that it was indeed possible for the GTO to compete in European sports car racing.

==First generation==
===1964===
The first Pontiac GTO began production September 3, 1963, and was available as an option package for the Pontiac Tempest-based LeMans model, available in coupé, hardtop, and convertible body styles. The US$295 package () included a V8 rated at at 4,800 rpm with a single Carter AFB four-barrel carburetor and dual exhaust pipes, chromed valve covers and air cleaner, seven-blade clutch fan, a floor-shifted three-speed manual transmission with a Hurst shifter, stiffer springs, larger diameter front sway bar, wider wheels with 7.50×14 redline tires, hood scoops, and GTO badges. Optional equipment included a four-speed manual transmission, Super Turbine 300 two-speed automatic transmission, a more powerful engine with &quot;Tri-Power&quot; carburetion (three two-barrel Rochester 2G carburetors) rated at , metallic drum brake linings, limited-slip differential, heavy-duty cooling, ride, and handling package as well as a tachometer mounted in the far right dial on the dash. Some limited power features were available, as well as other accessories. With every available option, the GTO cost about $4,500 () and weighed around .

Most contemporary road tests by the automotive press, such as &quot;Car Life&quot; criticized the slow steering, particularly without power steering, and inadequate drum brakes, which were identical to those of the normal Tempest. Frank Bridge&#x27;s initial sales forecast of 5,000 units proved inaccurate: the GTO package&#x27;s total sales amounted to 32,450 units.

===1965===
The Tempest model lineup, including the GTO, was restyled for the 1965 model year, adding to the overall length while retaining the same wheelbase and interior dimensions. It had Pontiac&#x27;s characteristic vertically stacked quad headlights. Overall weight was increased by about . The brake lining area increased by nearly 15%. Heavy-duty shocks were standard, as was a stronger front antisway bar. The dashboard design was changed, and an optional rally gauge cluster (US$86.08) added a more legible tachometer and oil pressure gauge. An additional option was a breakerless transistor ignition.

The 389 cubic-inch engines received revised cylinder heads with re-cored intake passages and high-rise intake manifolds, improving airflow to the engine. Rated power increased to at 5,000 rpm for the base four-barrel engine; the Tri-Power engine was now rated at 5,200 rpm. The &#x27;S&#x27;-cammed Tri-Power engine had slightly less peak torque rating than the base engine at 3,600 rpm as compared to at 3,200 rpm. Transmission and axle ratio choices remained the same. The three-speed manual was standard, while two four-speed manual transmissions (wide or close ratio) and a two-speed automatic transmission were optional.

The restyled car had a new simulated hood scoop. A seldom-seen dealer-installed option consisted of a metal underhood pan and gaskets to open the scoop, making it a cold air intake. The scoop was low enough that its effectiveness was questionable (it was unlikely to pick up anything but boundary layer air), but it allowed an enhanced engine sound. Another exterior change was the black &quot;egg-crate&quot; grille.

&quot;Car Life&quot; tested a 1965 GTO with Tri-Power and what they considered the most desirable options (close-ratio four-speed manual transmission, power steering, metallic brakes, rally wheels, 4.11 limited-slip differential, and &quot;Rally&quot; gauge cluster), with a total sticker price of US$3,643.79. With two testers and equipment aboard, they recorded a 0–60 miles per hour (0–97 km/h) acceleration time of 5.8 seconds, the standing quarter-mile in 14.5 seconds with a trap speed of 100 miles per hour (160 km/h), and an observed top speed of 114 miles per hour (182.4 km/h) at the engine&#x27;s 6,000 rpm redline. A four-barrel &quot;Motor Trend&quot; test car, a heavier convertible handicapped by the two-speed automatic transmission and the lack of a limited-slip differential, ran 0–60 mph in 7 seconds and through the quarter-mile in 16.1 seconds at 89 miles per hour (142.4 km/h).

Major criticisms of the GTO continued to center on its slow steering (ratio of 17.5:1, four turns lock-to-lock) and subpar brakes. &quot;Car Life&quot; was satisfied with the metallic brakes on its GTO, but &quot;Motor Trend&quot; and &quot;Road Test&quot; found the four-wheel drum brakes with organic linings to be alarmingly inadequate in high-speed driving.

Sales of the GTO, abetted by a marketing and promotional campaign that included songs and various merchandise, more than doubled to 75,342. It spawned many imitators, both within other GM divisions and its competitors.

===1966===

The GTO became a separate Pontiac model (model number 242) in 1966, instead of being an &quot;option package&quot; on the Tempest LeMans. The entire GM &quot;A&quot; body intermediate line was restyled that year, gaining more curvaceous styling with kicked-up rear fender lines for a &quot;Coke-bottle&quot; look, and a slightly &quot;tunneled&quot; backlight. The tail light featured a louvered cover, only seen on the GTO. Overall length grew only fractionally, to , still on a wheelbase, while width expanded to . The rear track increased by one inch (2.5 cm). Overall weight remained about the same. The GTO was available as a pillared coupe, a hardtop (without B-pillars), and a convertible. An automotive industry first was a plastic front grille that replaced the pot metal and aluminum versions used in earlier years. New Strato bucket seats were introduced with higher and thinner seat backs and contoured cushions for added comfort and adjustable headrests were introduced as a new option. The instrument panel was redesigned and more integrated than in previous years with the ignition switch moved from the far left of the dash to the right of the steering wheel. Four pod instruments continued, and the GTO&#x27;s dash was highlighted by walnut veneer trim.

Engine and carburetor choices remained the same as the previous year, except the Tri-Power option was discontinued mid-model year. A new engine was offered that saw few takers: the XS option consisted of a factory Ram Air set up with a new 744 high lift cam. Approximately 35 factory-installed Ram Air packages are believed to have been built, though 300 dealership-installed Ram Air packages are estimated to have been ordered.

Sales increased to 96,946, the highest production figure for all GTO years. Although Pontiac had strenuously promoted the GTO in advertising as the &quot;GTO Tiger,&quot; it had become known in the youth market as the &quot;goat.&quot;

===1967===
The GTO underwent a few styling changes in 1967. The louver-covered taillights were replaced with eight tail lights, four on each side. Rally II wheels with colored lug nuts were also available in 1967. The GTO emblems on the fenders&#x27; rear part were moved to the chrome rocker panels. The grille was changed from a purely split grille to one that shared some chrome.

The 1967 GTO was available in three body styles:
*Hardtop – 65,176 produced
*Convertible – 9,517 produced
*Sports coupe – 7,029 produced

The GTO also saw several mechanical changes in 1967. The Tri-Power carburetion system was replaced with a single 4-barrel Rochester Quadrajet carburetor. The engine received a larger cylinder bore for a total displacement of V8, which was available in three models: economy, standard, and high output. The economy engine used a two-barrel carburetor rather than the Rochester Quadrajet and was rated at at 4,400 rpm and at 3,400 rpm. The standard engine was rated at at 5,000 rpm, and the highest torque of the three engines at at 3,400 rpm. The high output engine produced the most power for that year at at 5,100 rpm and a maximum torque of at 3,600 rpm. Emission controls were fitted in GTOs sold in California.

The 1967 model year cars required new safety equipment. A collapsible steering column with an energy-absorbing steering wheel accompanied by a padded instrument panel, non-protruding control knobs, and four-way emergency flashers became standard. A shoulder belt option was also available, and the brake master cylinder was now a dual reservoir unit with a backup hydraulic circuit.

The two-speed automatic transmission was also replaced with a three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic TH-400, which was equipped with a Hurst Performance dual-gate shifter, called a &quot;his/hers&quot; shifter, that permitted either automatic shifting in &quot;drive&quot; or manual selection through the gears. Front disc brakes were also an option in 1967.

The GTO sales for 1967 totaled 81,722 units.
==Second generation==
===1968===

General Motors redesigned its A-body line for 1968, with more curvaceous, semi-fastback styling, which was a revival of a streamlining on all GM products from 1942 until 1950 as demonstrated on the Pontiac Streamliner. The wheelbase was shortened to on all two-door models. Overall length was reduced 5.9 inches (150 mm) and height dropped half an inch (12 mm), but overall weight was up about . Pontiac abandoned the familiar vertically stacked headlights in favor of a horizontal layout, but made hidden headlights available at extra cost. The concealed headlights were a popular option. The signature hood scoop was replaced by dual scoops on either side of a prominent hood bulge extending rearward from the protruding nose.

A unique feature was the body-color Endura front bumper. It was designed to absorb impact without permanent deformation at low speeds. Pontiac touted this feature heavily in advertising, showing hammering at the bumper to no discernible effect. A GTO could be ordered with &quot;Endura delete&quot;, in which case a chrome front bumper and grille from the Pontiac LeMans would replace the Endura bumper.

Powertrain options remained the same as in 1967, but the standard GTO engine&#x27;s power rating rose to at 5,000 rpm. A new Ram Air package, &quot;Ram Air II&quot;, became available in mid-year. It included freer-breathing cylinder heads, round port exhaust, and the 041 cam. The &#x27;official&#x27; power rating was not changed. Another carry-over from 1967 was the four-piston caliper disc brake option. However, most 1968 models had drum brakes all around. The 1968 model year was also the last the GTOs offered separate crank-operated front door vents.

Concealed windshield wipers, which presented a cleaner appearance hidden below the rear edge of the hood, were standard on the GTO and other 1968 GM products after being introduced initially on 1967 full-size Pontiacs. A popular option introduced during the 1967 model year was a hood-mounted tachometer, located in front of the windshield and lit for visibility at night. An in-dash tachometer was also available.

Redline bias-ply tires continued as standard equipment on the 1968 GTO, though they could be replaced by whitewall tires at no extra cost. A new option was radial tires for improved ride and handling. However, very few were delivered with the radial tires because of manufacturing problems encountered by the supplier B.F. Goodrich. The radial tire option was discontinued after 1968. Pontiac did not offer radial tires as a factory option on the GTO again until the 1974 model.

&quot;Hot Rod&quot; tested a four-speed GTO equipped with the standard engine and obtained a quarter mile reading of 14.7 seconds at in pure stock form. &quot;Motor Trend&quot; clocked a four-speed Ram Air GTO with 4.33 rear differential at 14.45 seconds at and a standard GTO with Turbo-Hydramatic and a 3.23 rear axle ratio at 15.93 seconds at . Testers were split about handling, with &quot;Hot Rod&quot; calling it &quot;the best-balanced car [Pontiac] ever built,&quot; but &quot;Car Life&quot; chided its excessive nose heaviness, understeer, and inadequate damping.

Royal Pontiac, located in Royal Oak, Michigan, offered a 428/Royal Bobcat conversion of the 1968 GTO. For $650.00 a 390-horsepower engine replaced the 400. The engine was disassembled and blueprinted to produce more than the advertised factory 390 horsepower and capable of 5,700 rpm. &quot;Car and Driver&quot; road-tested the 428 CID powered car with the Turbo-Hydramatic transmission and 3.55 gears. It could do 0–60 MPH in 5.2 seconds, 0–100 in 12.9 seconds, and the 1/4 mile in 13.8 seconds at 104 mph. This compared to a &quot; Car Life&quot; road test of a powered GTO with a Ram Air engine, four-speed transmission, and 3.90 gear, which did 0–60 in 6.6 seconds, 0–100 in 14.6 seconds, and the 1/4 mile in 14.53 at 99.7 mph. &quot;Car and Driver&quot; wrote that the powered car was &quot;a fine, exciting car for either touring or tooting around in traffic. Not overly fussy. Not difficult to drive–-up to a point. Too much throttle at the wrong time will spin the car, or send it rocketing off the road and into the farmer&#x27;s field. You can light up the car&#x27;s tires like it was an AA-fueler anytime the notion seizes your fancy.&quot; On the other hand, according to &quot;Car Life&quot;, the Ram Air-powered car &quot;likes to run between 3,000 and 6,000 rpm. Below 3,000, the GTO ran flat and a bit rough. Part-throttle driving at 2,000 rpm around town was difficult and unpleasant. Freeway cruising at 4,000 rpm is anything but pleasant and promises short life for hard-working engine components. Also, driving the GTO on wet roads with this deep geared axle was thrilling. Rear tire breakaway could be provoked by a slight jab at the accelerator, sending the car into a minor skid that usually used up more than one lane of space.&quot;

Like all 1968 passenger vehicles sold in the United States, GTOs now featured front outboard shoulder belts (cars built after January 1, 1968) and side marker lights. The GTO was now equipped with emissions controls to comply with the new 1968 federal vehicle emissions standards.

Now facing competition both within GM and from Ford, Dodge, and Plymouth—particularly the low-cost Plymouth Road Runner—the GTO won the &quot;Motor Trend&quot; Car of the Year Award. Sales reached 87,684 units, ultimately proving to be the second-best sales year for the GTO.

===1969===
The 1969 model eliminated the front door vent windows, had a slight grille and taillight revision, and moved the ignition key from the dashboard to the steering column (which locked the steering wheel when the key was removed, a federal requirement installed one year ahead of schedule), and the gauge face was changed from steel blue to black. In addition, the rear quarter-panel mounted side marker lamps changed from a red lens shaped like the Pontiac &quot;arrowhead&quot; emblem to one shaped like the broad GTO badge. Front outboard headrests were made standard equipment on all cars built in 1969.

The previous economy engine and standard V8 engine remained, while the &quot;400 H.O.&quot; was upgraded to the &quot;400 Ram Air&quot; (though now colloquially referred to as the &quot;Ram Air III&quot;, Pontiac never used that designation), rated at at 5,100 rpm. The top option was the Ram Air IV rated at at 5,500 rpm and at 3,900 rpm of torque, which featured special header-like high-flow exhaust manifolds, high-flow cylinder heads, a specific high-rise aluminum intake manifold, larger Rochester Quadrajet 4-barrel carburetor, high-lift/long-duration camshaft, plus various internal components capable of withstanding higher engine speeds and power output. Unlike the highest rpm Chevy big-block and Hemi engines, the Ram Air IV utilized hydraulic lifters.

By this time, the gross power ratings of both Ram Air engines were highly suspect, bearing less relationship to developed power and more to an internal GM policy limiting all cars except the Corvette to no more than one advertised horsepower per of curb weight. The higher-revving Ram Air IV&#x27;s advertised power peak was listed at 5,000 rpm—100 rpm lower than the less-powerful Ram Air 400.

A new model called &quot;The Judge&quot; was introduced. The name came from a comedy routine, &quot;Here Come de Judge&quot;, used repeatedly on the &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot; TV show. The Judge routine, made famous by comedian Flip Wilson, was borrowed from the act of long-time burlesque entertainer Dewey &quot;Pigmeat&quot; Markham. Advertisements used slogans like &quot;All rise for the Judge&quot; and &quot;The Judge can be bought&quot;. As initially conceived, the Judge was to be a low-cost GTO, stripped of features to make it competitive with the Plymouth Road Runner. The package was US$332 more expensive than a standard GTO, and included the Ram Air 400 engine, Rally II wheels without trim rings, Hurst shifter (with a unique T-shaped handle), wider tires, various decals, and a rear spoiler. Pontiac claimed that the spoiler had some functional effect at higher speeds, producing a small but measurable downforce, but it was of little value at legal speeds. The Judge was initially offered only in Carousel Red, but other colors became available midway into the model year.

The GTO was surpassed in sales both by the Chevrolet Chevelle SS396 and the Plymouth Road Runner, but 72,287 were sold during the 1969 model year, with 6,833 of them having the Judge package.

===1970===
The Tempest model line received another facelift for the 1970 model year. Hidden headlights were deleted in favor of four exposed round headlamps outboard of narrower grille openings. The nose retained the protruding vertical prow theme, although it was less prominent. While the standard Tempest and LeMans had chrome grilles, the GTO retained the Endura urethane cover around the headlamps and grille.

The suspension was upgraded with the addition of a rear anti-roll bar, essentially the same bar as used on the Oldsmobile 442 and Buick Gran Sport. The front anti-roll bar was slightly stiffer. The result was a reduction in body lean in turns and a modest reduction of understeer.

Another handling-related improvement was optional variable-ratio power steering. Rather than a fixed ratio of 17.5:1, requiring four turns lock-to-lock, the new system varied its ratio from 14.6:1 to 18.9:1, needing 3.5 turns lock-to-lock. Turning diameter was reduced from 40.9 feet (12.5 m) to 37.4 feet (11.4 m).

The base engine was unchanged for 1970, but the low-compression economy engine was deleted and the &quot;400 Ram Air&quot;(aka &quot;Ram Air III&quot;), now called &quot;Ram Air&quot;, and Ram Air IV remained available.

A new option was Pontiac&#x27;s D-port HO engine (different from the round-port offerings of the 1971 and 1972 cars), now that GM had rescinded its earlier ban on intermediates with engines larger than . The 455, a long-stroke engine also available in the full-size Pontiac line as well as the Grand Prix, was dubiously rated by Pontiac at , only moderately stronger than the base and less powerful than the &quot;Ram Air&quot;. The Pontiac brochure indicated the same 455 installed in the Grand Prix model was rated at . The camshafts used in the &quot;Ram Air&quot; 400 and the GTO 455 HO were the same. For example, manual transmission 455 HOs used the same 288/302 duration cam as the &quot;Ram Air&quot; 400. The 455 was rated at at 4,300 rpm. Its advantage was torque: at 2,700 rpm. A functional Ram Air scoop was available, but official horsepower and torque ratings were unchanged when so equipped. &quot;Car and Driver&quot; tested a heavily optioned 455 HO, with a four-speed transmission and 3.31 axle, and recorded a quarter-mile time of 15.0 seconds with a trap speed of . &quot;Car Life&quot; test car had the Turbo-Hydramatic 455 with a 3.55 rear differential, clocked 14.76 seconds quarter-mile time at , with an identical 6.6 second 0–60 mph acceleration time. Both were about slower than a &quot;Ram Air&quot; GTO with four-speed, although considerably less temperamental: the Ram Air engine idled roughly and was difficult to drive at low speeds. The smaller displacement engine recorded less than of gasoline, compared to - for the 455.

A new and short-lived option for 1970 was the Vacuum Operated Exhaust (VOE), which was actuated via an under-dash lever marked &quot;exhaust&quot;. The VOE was designed to reduce exhaust backpressure and increase power and performance but also substantially increased exhaust noise. The VOE option was offered from November 1969 to January 1970. Pontiac management was ordered to cancel the VOE option by GM&#x27;s upper management following a TV commercial for the GTO that aired during Super Bowl IV on CBS January 11, 1970. In that commercial, titled the &quot;Humbler&quot; (an advertising tagline Pontiac used in print ads to describe all 1970 GTOs), which was broadcast only that one time, a young man pulled up in a new GTO to a drive-in restaurant with dramatic music and exhaust noise in the background, pulling the &quot;exhaust&quot; knob to activate the VOE and then left the drive-in after failing to find a street racing opponent. That particular commercial was also canceled by order of GM management. Approximately 233 1970 GTOs were factory built with this option including 212 hardtop coupes and 21 convertibles, equipped with either four-speed manual or Turbo Hydra-Matic transmissions. While allegedly all were fitted with the standard GTO &quot;YS&quot; V8 engine, according to the 1970 Pontiac Accessorizer book, VOE was available with the 455 V8. The Accessorizer book indicates that VOE was unavailable with either 400 cubic inch engines with Ram Air. However, it does not specify whether it was unavailable with the 455 when equipped with the optional Ram Air induction components. The particular GTO in the commercial was Palladium Silver with a black bucket seat interior. It was unusual in several respects as it also had the under-dash &quot;Ram Air&quot; knob just to the right of the VOE knob, and it had &quot;&#x27;69 Judge&quot; stripes, as a few very-early 1970 GTOs could be ordered with. It also had a Ram Air IV 400 V8 engine, 4-speed manual transmission, remote mirror, Rally II wheels, A/C, hood tachometer, and a new-for-1970 Formula steering wheel. The car in the ad was a 1970 GTO pilot car built in May 1969.

The Judge package remained available as an option on the GTO. The Judge came standard with the &quot;Ram Air&quot; 400 V8, while the Ram Air IV was optional. Though the 455 HO V8 was available as an option on the standard GTO throughout the entire model year, the 455 HO was not offered on the Judge until late in the year. Orbit Orange (a bright school bus yellow hue) became the new feature color for the 1970 Judge, but any GTO color was available. Arch striping was relocated to the creases above the wheel wells, a new styling trait of the 1970 GTO introduced the previous year on the 1969 Firebird. The Judge package also included dark argent grille surrounds, black painted hood air inlet ornaments, and a revised higher rear airfoil.

The new styling did little to help declining sales, which were now being hit by sagging buyer interest in all muscle cars, fueled by the punitive surcharges levied by automobile insurance companies, which sometimes resulted in insurance payments higher than car payments for some drivers. Sales were down to 40,149, of which 3,797 were the Judge. Of those 3,797 cars built in the Judge trim level, only 168 were ordered in the convertible form: RA 400 (147 built), RA IV (18 built), and 455 HO (3 built). The &#x27;69/&#x27;70 &quot;round-port&quot; RA IV engine, a derivative of the &#x27;68½ &quot;round-port&quot; RA II engine, was the most exotic high-performance engine ever offered by PMD and factory-installed in a GTO or Firebird. The 1969 version had a slight advantage as the compression ratio was still at 10.75:1 as opposed to 10.5:1 in 1970. It is speculated that PMD was losing $1,000 on every RA IV GTO and Firebird built, and the RA IV engine was under-rated at . A total of 37 RA IV GTO convertibles were built in 1970: 24 four-speeds and 13 automatics. Of the 13 1970 GTO RA IV/auto convertibles built, only six received the Judge option. The GTO remained the third best-selling intermediate muscle car, outsold only by the Chevrolet Chevelle SS 396/454 and the Plymouth Road Runner.

===1971===
The 1971 GTO had another modest facelift, this time with wire-mesh grilles, horizontal bumper bars on either side of the grille opening, more closely spaced headlamps, and a new hood with the dual scoops relocated to the leading edge, not far above the grille. Overall length grew slightly to . Sport mirrors increased standard width by two inches, from 74.5 to 76.5 inches.

A new corporate recision to prepare GM-built cars for no-lead gasoline required a reduction in compression ratios. The &quot;Ram Air&quot; and Ram Air IV engines did not return for 1971. The standard GTO engine was the V8, but now with 8.2:1 compression ratio. Power was rated at SAE gross at 4,800 rpm and torque at at 3,600 rpm. It had SAE net at 4,400 rpm in the GTO and SAE net at 4,400 rpm in the Firebird.

Optional was the V8 with a four-barrel carburetor, 8.4:1 compression ratio, and 325 hp (242 kW) at 4,400 rpm, which was only available with the Turbo Hydra-matic TH-400 transmission. It had SAE net at 4,000 rpm in the GTO and SAE net in the Firebird. This engine was not available with Ram Air induction.

The top-of-the-line GTO engine for 1971 was the new HO with 8.4 compression, rated at at 4,800 rpm and at 3,600 rpm. It had SAE net at 4,400 rpm in the GTO and SAE net in the Firebird Trans Am or Formula 455 with Ram Air induction(Formula; shaker hood inlet on Trans Am). The 1971 Pontiac brochure declared that this engine produced more NET horsepower than any other in its history. That would imply the 400 CID V8 Ram Air engines had less than net.

For 1971, the standard rear-end was an open ten bolt. Positraction 10 bolt rear ends were optional on 400 CID engine-equipped GTOs, while all 455 CID GTOs were available with a 12 bolt open or optional 12 bolt Positraction rear-end.

&quot;Motor Trend&quot; tested a 1971 GTO with the 455, four-speed transmission, and 3.90 axle, and obtained a 0–60 mph acceleration time of 6.1 seconds and a quarter mile acceleration time of 13.4 seconds at 102 mph (164 km/h).

The Judge returned for a final year, with the standard Mountain Performance package being 455 HO. Only 357 were sold, including 17 convertibles. On February 11, 1971, Pontiac announced that no new orders for The Judge would be accepted after March 1, 1971. A total of 10,532 GTOs were sold in 1971, 661 non-Judge-equipped convertibles.

===1972===
In 1972, the GTO reverted from a separate model to a US$353.88 (~$ in ) option package for the LeMans and LeMans Sport coupes. On the base LeMans line, the GTO package could be had with either the low-priced pillared coupé or hardtop coupé. Both models came standard with cloth and vinyl or all-vinyl bench seats and rubber floor mats on the pillared coupe and carpeting on the hardtop, creating a lower-priced GTO. The LeMans Sport was offered only as a hardtop coupe. It included Strato bucket seats upholstered in vinyl, carpeting on the floor and lower door panels, vinyl door-pull straps, custom pedal trim, and a cushioned steering wheel, much like GTOs of previous years. Other optional equipment was similar to the 1971 and earlier models. Planned for 1972 as a GTO option was the ducktail rear spoiler from the Pontiac Firebird, but after a few cars were built with that option, the mold used to produce the spoiler broke, and the accessory was canceled. Rally II and honeycomb wheels were optional on all GTOs, with the honeycomb wheels now featuring red Pontiac arrowhead emblems on the center caps. In contrast, the Rally II wheels continued with the same caps as before, with the letters &quot;PMD&quot; (for Pontiac Motor Division).

Power, now rated in SAE net horesepower terms, was down further, to at 4,400 rpm and at 3,200 rpm torque for the standard engine. The optional 455 had the same rated power (although at a peak of 3,600 rpm), but substantially more torque. Most of the drop was attributable to the new rating system (which now reflected an engine in as-installed condition with mufflers, accessories, and standard intake). The engines were relatively little changed from 1971.

The HO engine was optional, essentially similar to that used in the Trans Am. It was rated at at 4,000 rpm and at 3,200 rpm, also in the new SAE net figures. Despite its 8.4:1 compression, it was as strong and like all other 1972-model engines, it could perform on low-octane regular leaded, low-lead, or unleaded types of gasoline. Only 646 cars with this engine were sold.

Sales fell by 45%, to 5,811. (Some sources discount the single convertible and the three wagons, listing the total as 5,807.) Although Pontiac did not offer a production GTO convertible in 1972, a buyer could order a LeMans Sport convertible with either of the three GTO engines and other sporty/performance options to create a GTO in all but name. Even the GTO&#x27;s Endura bumper was offered as an option on LeMans/Sport models, with &quot;PONTIAC&quot; spelled out on the driver&#x27;s side grille rather than &quot;GTO.&quot;

==Third generation==
===1973===

The GTO was an option package for the LeMans and featured a reskinned A-body with &quot;Colonnade&quot; hardtop styling, which eliminated the authentic hardtop design because of the addition of a roof pillar, but retained the frameless door windows. Rear-side windows were now of a fixed design that could not be opened and were triangular in shape. New federal laws for 1973 demanded front bumpers capable of withstanding 5-mile-per-hour (8 km/h) impacts without damaging any safery-related components (5 mph rear bumpers became standard in 1974). The result was prominent and heavy chrome bumpers at the front and rear. The overall styling of the 1973 Pontiac A-body intermediates (LeMans, Luxury LeMans, GTO, and Grand Am) was generally not well received by the general public.

In contrast, the Pontiac Grand Prix and Chevrolet Monte Carlo, which were also derived from the intermediate A-body, were much better received because of their squared-off styling and formal rooflines with vertical windows. Pontiac&#x27;s sister division, Oldsmobile, received better reviews from the automotive press and the car-buying public with the similar-bodied Cutlass.

Again, the 1973 GTO option was offered on two models, including the base LeMans coupe and the LeMans Sport Coupe. The base LeMans coupe featured a cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl bench seat, while the higher trim LeMans Sport Coupe had all-vinyl interiors with Strato bucket seats or a notchback bench seat with a folding armrest. The LeMans Sport Coupe also had louvered rear side windows from the Grand Am in place of the standard triangular windows of the base LeMans.

The standard V8 in the 1973 GTO was further reduced in compression to 8.0:1, dropping its rating to . The 400 engine was available with any of the three transmissions, including the standard three-speed manual or optional four-speed or Turbo Hydra-Matic. The V8 remained optional but it rated power lowered to and was available only with the Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission. The 455 HO engine was discontinued, though GM initially announced the availability of a Super Duty 455 engine (shared with the contemporary Pontiac Trans Am SD455), and several such cars were made available for testing, impressing reviewers with their power and flexibility. Nevertheless, the Super Duty was never actually offered for public sale in the GTO. Eight prototypes were built for testing but were subsequently destroyed.

A new change for 1973 was a hood accented with NACA ducts. These ducts were designed to force air into the ram air-induction system despite the production GTO not offering that system.

Sales dropped to 4,806, partly due to competition from the new Grand Am and the lack of promotion for the GTO. By the end of the model year, an emerging oil crisis quashed consumer interest in muscle cars.

==Fourth generation==
===1974===
Wanting to avoid internal competition with the &quot;Euro-styled&quot; Pontiac Grand Am and looking for an entry into the compact muscle market populated by the Plymouth Duster 360, Ford Maverick Grabber, and AMC Hornet X, Pontiac moved the 1974 GTO option to the compact Pontiac Ventura, which shared its basic body shell and sheet metal with the Chevrolet Nova.
The GTO option was available on both the base Ventura and Ventura Custom lines. It was offered as a two-door coupe version featuring a traditional separate trunk or a two-door hatchback with an opening integrated rear backlight and deck with hydraulic struts to allow access to a cargo area and included a fold-down rear seatback. The two body styles differed in profile and had distinct rear quarter glass designs.

The base Ventura interior consisted of bench seats and rubber floor mats. Bucket seats could be added for $132 (Code A51), while the Ventura Custom had upgraded bench seats or the optional Strato bucket seats along with carpeting, cushioned steering wheel, and custom pedal trim.

The $461 GTO package (Code WW3) included a three-speed manual transmission with Hurst floor shifter, heavy-duty suspension with front and rear anti-roll bars, a shaker hood, special grille, wing mirrors, and wheels, and various GTO emblems. The only engine was the V8 with a 7.6:1 compression ratio and a Rochester 4MC Quadrajet carburetor. The engine was rated at at 4,400 rpm and of torque at 2,800 rpm. Optional transmissions included a wide-ratio four-speed with Hurst shifter for $207 (Code M20) or the three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic. Power Steering was a $104 option (Code N41) as well as Power front disc brakes for $71 (Code JL2).

Bias-belted tires were standard equipment, but a radial-tuned suspension option added radial tires and upgraded suspension.

The revamped model quickly became a sore spot for loyalists, a situation not helped when &quot;Motor Trend&quot; tested the &quot;Hot Sports Compacts&quot; in their February 1974 issue—the staff could only muster a 0–60 mph acceleration time of 9.5 seconds and a quarter-mile trap time of 16.5 seconds (at 84.03 mph). &quot;Cars Magazine&quot; tested a 1974 GTO with the optional four-speed manual transmission and obtained a 0–60 mph acceleration time of 7.7 seconds and a quarter-mile time of 15.72 seconds at . Jerry Heasley of &quot;High Performance Pontiac&quot; magazine called the car &quot;a joke of a Ventura compact...uglier and stupid looking,&quot; in their August 1983 Special GTO issue.

Sales improved over the 1973 model year to 7,058 units, but not enough to justify continuing marketing the GTO option package. Problems for the 1974 model year included an oil embargo and gas rationing. Other factors leading to the discontinuation of the GTO were the declining interest in performance cars and tighter emissions requirements that lowered engine compression ratios to use unleaded fuel and catalytic converters.

==1999 concept car==
During the 1999 Detroit Auto Show, a GTO concept car with a heritage-inspired &quot;Coke-bottle&quot; shape, grille, and hood scoop, was introduced. It was only intended to be a design study and had no engine. It had styling cues paying homage to all the generations of the Pontiac GTOs, such as rear quarter windows reminiscent of the 1967 Pontiac GTO, hood-mounted tachometer pod, split grilles, tapered tail lights, twin hood scoops, and unique 21-inch wheels.

==Fifth generation==


===2004===
In 2004, the Pontiac GTO was relaunched in the U.S. market in the form of a rebadged, third-generation Holden Monaro.

The VZ Monaro-based GTO was Pontiac&#x27;s first captive import since the 1988–1993 Pontiac LeMans. The V2/VZ Monaro was a 2-door coupe variant of the Australian developed VT/VX Holden Commodore. The Monaro was also exported to the United Kingdom as the Vauxhall Monaro and to the Middle East as the Chevrolet Lumina SS.

The revival was prompted by former GM North America Chairman Bob Lutz, who had the idea of importing a Holden Commodore-based vehicle after reading a &quot;Car and Driver&quot; review of the Holden Commodore SS, published circa 2000. &quot;Car and Driver&quot; praised the performance of the V8-powered, rear-wheel drive Holden Commodore SS, but noted that even though it was one of the best vehicles that GM offered at the time, it could not be purchased in the United States. The idea of importing a rear-wheel drive Holden as a GM North American performance offering gradually transformed into importing the Monaro. Lutz and other GM executives later drove a Holden Monaro while on a business trip in Australia, which convinced them that importing the car could be a profitable venture.

Lutz had to convince the GM executive hierarchy to import the car and overcome a corporate culture that promoted regional autonomy between GM North America and its overseas divisions. As Lutz described, this resulted in an &quot;unnecessarily long gestation period,&quot; at a much higher cost than anticipated. The Monaro design was introduced in 2001 but appeared &quot;dated&quot; in 2003 when it was released in the United States. It was also originally planned to sell for about $25,000, but by the time it was launched in the U.S., the Australian dollar&#x27;s growth against the U.S. dollar had inflated the price of the car to well over $34,000. Both of these elements played a role in the car&#x27;s lukewarm acceptance by the general public.

The GTO was assembled by GM&#x27;s Holden subsidiary at Elizabeth, South Australia. It was equipped with the 5.7 L LS1 V8 engine for the 2004 model year, the same engine found in the concurrent model year Chevrolet Corvette, with a choice of a 6-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic. Changes from the Australian-built Monaro included bracing additions to the body to meet U.S. crash standards, a &quot;corporate Pontiac&quot; front facia, new badging, &quot;GTO&quot; stitching on the front seats, and a revised exhaust system. GM Engineers benchmarked the sound of the 1964 GTO held in the Pontiac historical collection and other LS1-powered vehicles, while working with the exhaust vendor to tune the system. An effort was made to make the new GTO invoke the same sound as the original while still meeting the noise threshold required by some states. The 2004 GTO exhaust was an actual dual system that followed the original Monaro exhaust routing, thus both tailpipes exited on the driver side of the vehicle. General Motors claimed performance of 0–60 mph in 5.3 seconds and a 13.8 second quarter mile time, which was closely verified by several automotive magazine tests.

Initially, in 2004, the car was offered in seven colors: Barbados Blue Metallic, Cosmos Purple Metallic, Quicksilver Metallic, Phantom Black Metallic, Impulse Blue Metallic, Torrid Red, and Yellow Jacket.

GM had high expectations to sell 18,000 units, but the lukewarm reception of the car in the U.S. curtailed the target. The styling was frequently derided by critics as being too &quot;conservative&quot; and &quot;anonymous&quot; to befit either the GTO heritage or the current car&#x27;s performance. Given the newly revived muscle car climate, it was also overshadowed by the Chevrolet Monte Carlo, Chrysler 300, Dodge Charger, Dodge Magnum, and the new Ford Mustang, all of whom featured more traditional &quot;muscle car&quot; aesthetics. Critics also pointed out the car&#x27;s high sale price. Sales were also limited because of tactics of dealerships, such as initially charging large markups and denying requests for test drives of the vehicle. By the end of the year, the 2004 models were sold at a significant discount. Sales totaled 13,569 of the 15,728 imported cars for 2004.

The hood scoops slated for production in 2005 were pushed into production as part of an over-the-counter Sport Appearance Package. The 2004 Sport Appearance Package also included a taller and more angular rear spoiler and deeper inset front grilles.

Closing out the 2004 model year was the W40 package featuring an exclusive paint color called Pulse Red, red &quot;GTO&quot; embroidery on black-anthracite seats, and a grey-colored gauge cluster. The last 794 units of the 2004 model year GTOs were equipped with the W40 package.

===Performance===
Pontiac GTO 5.7 (2004)
* Top Speed - 160 mph
* 0-60 mph - 5.0 seconds
* 0-100 mph - 12.3 seconds
* Quarter Mile Drive - 13.9 seconds

===2005===
The 2005 model year cars continued with the standard hood scoops, split rear exhaust pipes with a revised rear fascia, and, late in the year, optional 18 inch (45.7 cm) wheels. The major change for 2005 was the replacement of the LS1 engine with the LS2 engine. This engine had increased power and torque of with respectively. Other changes included larger front rotors and caliper hardware from the Corvette, a strengthened drivetrain with the addition of a driveshaft with larger &quot;giubos&quot; and a larger differential flange, as well as revised half-shafts. Dashboard gauge graphics were revised. The optional dealer-installed Sport Appearance Package became available. It differed visually by having a different lower rear fascia, aftermarket mufflers with quad chrome exhaust tips, revised spoiler, front lower fascia extension, recessed grilles, and revised rocker panels. This package was available from GM as an accessory in red, silver, black, or primer for other color cars. Production amounted to 11,069 cars due in part to a shortened model year. Barbados Blue and Cosmos Purple were dropped for the year, but Cyclone Grey and Midnight Blue Metallic were added. Customers also had the option to order their GTO without hood scoops (RPO code BZJ), though only 24 cars were produced with such an option. With an improved powerplant, GM claimed the car to be capable of accelerating from 0 to in 4.7 seconds and a 13.0 second quarter-mile time at (automatic transmission). &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine tested the car and measured the 0–60 mph acceleration time of 4.8 seconds and a quarter-mile time of 13.3 seconds at with its BFGoodrich g-Force T/A KDWS, 245/45ZR-17 95W M+S front and rear tires and a manual transmission. The 0–100 mph and 0–130 mph times were 11.7 and 19.6 respectively. Motor-week also tested the 2005 GTO.

===2006===

For 2006, two additional colors were added, Spice Red Metallic and Brazen Orange Metallic, while Midnight Blue Metallic and Yellow Jacket were dropped. Changes for 2006 included revised blacked-out tail lamps, illuminated steering wheel radio controls, faster-moving power seat motors, and an interior power door lock switch. The climate control button for the A/C also had the word &quot;Defog&quot;, a carryover from the 2005 model year, along with the , 6.0 L engine.

On February 21, 2006, Buick-Pontiac-GMC General Manager John Larson announced to dealers that GM would halt imports of the GTO in September, making 2006 the last model year for the new GTO. The explanation was the inability to meet new airbag deployment standards for 2007. The final production numbers of the 2006 Pontiac GTO amounted to 13,948 cars, an increase from 11,069 vehicles from the previous model year.

The last Pontiac GTO, which was also the last Monaro-based coupe produced, came off the assembly line in Australia on June 14, 2006. Total production for all three years amounted to 40,808 vehicles. The fifth generation of the GTO was only intended as a limited production car for those three years from the beginning of the program.

<doc id="228455" wikidata="Q599642" url="?curid=228455" title="Archery at the 1900 Summer Olympics">
<text>At the 1900 Summer Olympics, seven of the archery events that took place in Paris, France, are considered to be &quot;Olympic&quot; by Olympic historians, with 153 archers competing. The identities of 17 of those archers are known, though a number of those are known only by their surnames.

In total, 1400 archers to over 1500 archers participated in the archery competitions. It was the first time that archery was featured in the Olympics. All seven events were for men. Only France, Belgium, and the Netherlands sent archers. Six Dutch archers competed, but none qualified for any of the individual event finals.

Until July 2021, the IOC did not decide which events were &quot;Olympic&quot; and which were not. 

The events included here exclude many of the archery events held in France in 1900 connected to the World&#x27;s Fair; those events, if included, would put the number of archers over 5,000. These events are excluded typically because of their status as French national championships rather than international contests (even though international participants were invited to enter) or because, as team events, they were essentially qualifiers for the final events.

The team events &quot;au berceau&quot; served as qualifying for the individual events. The top eight finishers in the team events &quot;au cordon doré&quot; were eligible to compete for the individual titles, while the top six finishers in the team events &quot;au chapelet&quot; were eligible to compete for the individual titles. Two immensely popular types of archery – short-range butt shooting in a covered gallery (&quot;au berceau&quot;) and popinjay (&quot;sur la perche&quot;) – were practiced mainly in France and Belgium.

A case could also be made that only one event took place &quot;au berceau&quot;, that of the &quot;Championnat du Monde&quot;: this event was contested between the two best performing &quot;au berceau&quot; archers in the individual events, &quot;au cordon doré&quot; and &quot;au chapelet&quot;, being Henri Hérouin and Hubert Van Innis. Thus, all the earlier events could be considered qualifying for that one final event.

Crossbow shooting events also took place, though these are not considered to be Olympic.

<doc id="228458" wikidata="Q1072763" url="?curid=228458" title="Muscle car">
<text>A muscle car is an American-made two-door sports coupe with a powerful engine, generally designed for high-performance driving.

In 1949, General Motors introduced its 88 with the company&#x27;s OHV Rocket V8 engine, which was previously available only in its luxury Oldsmobile 98. This formula of putting a maker&#x27;s largest, most powerful engine in a smaller, lighter, more affordable vehicle evolved into the &quot;muscle car&quot; category. Chrysler and Ford quickly followed suit with the Chrysler Saratoga and the Lincoln Capri.

The term &quot;muscle car&quot;, which appeared in the mid-1960s, was originally applied to &quot;performance&quot;-oriented street cars produced to fill a newly recognized niche; it entered the general vocabulary through car magazines and automobile marketing and advertising. By the early 1970s, muscle cars included special editions of mass-production cars designed for street and track drag racing. The concept of high performance at lower prices was exemplified by the 1968 Plymouth Road Runner and companion Dodge Super Bee, whose powerful engines drove relatively basic-trimmed intermediate-sized cars that were meant to undercut more expensive, more stylish, and better-appointed models from General Motors and Ford that had come to define the market, such as the Pontiac GTO (1964), 396 Chevrolet Chevelle (1965), 400 Buick Gran Sport (1965), 400 Oldsmobile 442 (1965), as well as the 427 Mercury Comet Cyclone (1964) and 390 Mercury Cyclone (1966). 

By some definitions – including those used by &quot;Car and Driver&quot;, &quot;CNBC&quot;, &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot;, and &quot;Motor Trend&quot;—pony cars such as the Ford Mustang, Chevrolet Camaro, Plymouth Barracuda, Pontiac Firebird, AMC Javelin, and their luxury companions in that large, influential, and lucrative 1960s–70s niche, the Mercury Cougar and Dodge Challenger, could also qualify as &quot;muscle cars&quot; if outfitted with suitable high-performance equipment.

== Terminology ==
=== Definition ===
The definition of a muscle car is subjective and endlessly debated, resulting in the term having few universally agreed characteristics:
* A large high-performance V8 engine, often in the most powerful configuration offered for a particular model
* Rear-wheel drive
* Being manufactured in the United States in the 1960s or early 1970s (the specific year range of 1964–1973 is sometimes used)
* A relatively lightweight two-door body (though opinions vary as to whether high-performance full-size cars, compacts, and pony cars qualify as muscle cars, and why a two-seat AMC AMX could be, but a two-seat Chevrolet Corvette was not. While some feel that only mid-size cars can be considered muscle cars, this view is not held by the top, industry-defining, enthusiast publications, including &quot;Car and Driver&quot;, &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot;, and &quot;Motor Trend&quot;.

High-powered pony cars are sometimes considered muscle cars, as by the above-mentioned publications, with some exceptional personal luxury cars also regarded by some as qualifying on their merits. In the opposite direction, by the late 1960s a wave of inexpensive, straight-line speed oriented stripped down intermediate sedans offered at prices under as expanded the original definition from a &quot;muscle car&quot; as one offering &quot;both&quot; performance and some measure of style, accessories, and cachet, and doubled it back toward the drag strip focus of such exceptional early proto-muscle cars as the limited production, factory experimental 1964 Ford Fairlane Thunderbolt.

Sports cars – including those which meet all the above most basic criterion, such as the 1969 ZL-1 Corvette, with an all-aluminum V8 listed at but reported to produce , that slung the car through the traps in 10.89 seconds – are considered muscle cars by some, and not by others. Drag strip-oriented fans see muscle cars as an extension of the hot rodding philosophy of taking a small car and putting a large-displacement engine in it to maximize straight-line speed. However, widespread public acceptance and use of the term, including that exemplified by the &quot;Car and Driver&quot;, &quot;CNBC&quot;, &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot;, and &quot;Motor Trend&quot; top muscle car lists below, affirm a much broader interpretation as the norm.

=== &quot;Supercar&quot; ===
Muscle cars were initially referred to as &quot;supercars&quot; in the United States, such as the 1957 Rambler Rebel, which was described as a &quot;potent mill turned the lightweight Rambler into a veritable supercar.&quot; From the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s, &quot;dragstrip bred&quot; mid-size cars equipped with large V8 engines and rear-wheel drive were also referred to as supercars, more often than muscle cars.

In 1966, the supercar became an &quot;industry trend&quot;. This was when the four domestic automakers &quot;needed to cash in on the supercar market&quot; with eye-catching, heart-stopping cars. An example of the use of the supercar description for early muscle car models includes the May 1965 &quot;Car Life&quot; road test of the Pontiac GTO, followed in 1968 with a &quot;Car and Driver&quot; review of the 1969 American Motors SC/Rambler describing it as ready to compete in &quot;the Supercar street racer gang&quot; market segment, with the initials &quot;SC&quot; signifying SuperCar, and a 1969 &quot;Car Life&quot; review that included how &quot;Hurst puts American Motors into the Supercar club with the 390 Rogue&quot;.
The supercar market segment in the U.S. at the time included unique versions of regular production models that were positioned in several sizes and market segments (such as the &quot;economy supercar&quot;), as well as limited edition, documented dealer-converted vehicles. However, over time the term came to be applied to much, much more expensive and exotic cars, which claimed the name supercar.

== History ==
=== 1950s: Origins ===
Opinions on the origin of the muscle car vary, but the 1949 Oldsmobile Rocket 88 is cited as the first full-sized muscle car. The Rocket 88 was the first time a powerful V8 engine was available in a smaller and lighter body style (in this case the engine from the larger Oldsmobile 98 with the body from the six-cylinder Oldsmobile 76). The Rocket 88 produced at 3600 rpm and at 1800 rpm and won eight out of ten races in the 1950 NASCAR season. The Rocket 88&#x27;s Oldsmobile 303 V8 engine, along with the Cadillac 331 engine, also introduced in 1949, are stated to have &quot;launched the modern era of the high-performance V-8.&quot;

In 1955, the large-sized Chrysler C-300 - the first in a long, 15-year series of large, expensive, performance-first Chryslers - was introduced that produced from its V8 engine, and it was advertised as &quot;America&#x27;s Most Powerful Car&quot;. Capable of accelerating from 0 to in 9.8 seconds and reaching , the 1955 Chrysler 300 is also recognized as one of the best-handling cars of its era.

The compact-sized 1956 Studebaker Golden Hawk was powered by a Packard V8, the second most powerful engine to the Chrysler 300.

The Rambler Rebel, introduced by American Motors Corporation (AMC) in 1957, is the first mid-sized car to be available with a big-block V8 engine. The Rebel followed most of the muscle car formula including &quot;make &#x27;em go fast as well as cheaply.&quot; It is therefore considered by some to be the first muscle car. With a V8 engine producing , its 0–60 mph acceleration of 7.5 seconds made it the fastest stock American sedan at the time. Only the fuel-injected Chevrolet Corvette beat it by half a second.

=== Early 1960s: Drag racing influences ===
The popularity and performance of muscle cars grew in the early 1960s. This was when Mopar (Dodge, Plymouth, and Chrysler) and Ford battled for supremacy in drag racing. The 1961 Chevrolet Impala offered an SS package for $53.80, which consisted of a V8 engine producing along with upgraded brakes, tires, and suspension. The 1962 Dodge Dart 413 (nicknamed Max Wedge) had a V8 which produced and could cover the quarter-mile in under 13 seconds.

In 1963, two hundred Ford Galaxie &quot;R-code&quot; cars were factory-built specifically for drag racing, resulting in a full-size car that could cover the quarter-mile in a little over 12 seconds. Upgrades included fiberglass panels, aluminum bumpers, traction bars, and a Ford FE-based racing engine conservatively rated at . The road-legal version of the Galaxie 427 used the &quot;Q-code&quot; engine which produced . The following year, Ford installed the proven 427 &quot;top-oiler&quot; engine in the smaller and lighter Fairlane body, creating the Ford Thunderbolt. The Thunderbolt included several weight-saving measures (including acrylic windows and fibreglass/aluminium body panels and bumpers) and a stock Thunderbolt could cover the quarter-mile in 11.76 seconds. The Thunderbolt was technically road-legal, however, it was considered unsuitable even &quot;for driving to and from the (drag)strip, let alone on the street in everyday use&quot;. A total of 111 Thunderbolts were built.

The General Motors competitor to the Thunderbolt was the Z-11 option package for the full-size Chevrolet Impala coupe, of which 57 examples were produced in 1963 only. The Z-11 Impala was powered by a version of the W-series big-block engine, which was officially rated at . With a compression ratio of 13.5:1, the engine required high-octane fuel. The RPOZ-11 package also included weight reduction measures such as an aluminum hood and fenders, the removal of sound-deadening material as well as the deletion of the heater and radio.

In 1964, a drag racing version of the Dodge 330 was created, called the &quot;330 Lightweight&quot;. It was powered by a version of the Hemi racing engine which was official rated at , but rumored to have an actual power output higher than this. Weight reduction measures included an aluminium hood as well as lightweight front bumpers, fenders and doors, polycarbonate side windows, and no sound deadening. Like other lightweights of the era, it came with a factory disclaimer: &quot;Designed for supervised acceleration trials. Not recommended for general everyday driving because of the compromises in the all-round characteristics which must be made for this type of vehicle.&quot;

Also using the 426 Hemi racing engine was the limited production 1965 Plymouth Satellite 426 Hemi. In 1966, the racing version of the 426 Hemi was replaced by a detuned &quot;Street Hemi&quot; version, also with a size of 426 cu in and an official power rating of ). The 1966 Plymouth Satellite 426 Hemi could run a 13.8-second quarter-mile at and had a base price of $3,850.
=== 1964–1970: Peak muscle car era ===


Although pure muscle cars often sold in relatively small volumes, manufacturers valued the halo effect of the publicity created by these models. Competition between manufacturers led to a horsepower war that peaked in 1970, with models such as the LS-6 Chevelle advertising as much as .

The Pontiac GTO, a car that captured the public mind and strongly influenced the muscle car era, was introduced in 1964 as an optional package for the intermediate-size Pontiac Tempest. The GTO was developed by Pontiac division president John DeLorean and was initially powered by a V8 engine producing . The success of the GTO led other GM divisions to develop muscle cars based on intermediate-sized platforms: the 1964 Oldsmobile 442, 1964 Chevrolet Chevelle SS, and 1965 Buick Gran Sport.

The AMC V8 engine was enlarged to in 1968, which produced and was first used in the 1968 AMC Rebel SST, AMC Javelin Go-package, and AMC AMX. AMC was a car manufacturing company that made these two incredible cars. AMC only made small economy cars until they hired Dick Teague as a designer, who later became the vice president. AMC was not known as a muscle car maker, but the new AMX and AMC Javelin became top competitors.

As the 1960s progressed, optional equipment and luxury appointments increased in many popular models of &quot;performance-oriented&quot; cars. With the added weight and power-consuming accessories and features, engines had to be more powerful to maintain performance levels, and the cars became more expensive. In response, some &quot;budget&quot; muscle cars began to appear, such as the 1967 Plymouth GTX, the 1968 Plymouth Road Runner, and the 1968 Dodge Super Bee. In 1969, the Plymouth Road Runner was awarded &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine&#x27;s Car of the Year. With optional performance parts such as intake and exhaust manifolds, upgraded carburetor, and drag-racing tires, the Road Runner had a quarter-mile time of 14.7 seconds at . In this customized form, the cost of the Road Runner was US$3,893.

The Plymouth Barracuda was a pony car that could be turned into a muscle car with the addition of the famed Chrysler 426 Hemi, available as an option beginning in 1968, after debuting in street form two years earlier in the Plymouth Belvedere, Dodge Coronet, and Dodge Charger. Originally based on the smaller compact car body and chassis of the Plymouth Valiant, the Barracuda was also available with a V8 engine producing . It could run a quarter-mile in 13.33 seconds at on the drag strip. The base price was $2,796.00; the price as tested by &quot;Hot Rod&quot; was $3,652. The related 1970 Plymouth Duster was powered by a V8 engine producing . Performance figures were 0 to in 6.0 seconds and the quarter-mile time of in 14.7 seconds at .

The Chevrolet L72 big-block engine became available in the mid-sized Chevrolet Chevelle in 1969 as the COPO 427 option. The 427 Chevelle could run a 13.3 sec. quarter-mile at . Chevrolet rated the engine at , but the NHRA claimed power output to be . The following year, the &quot;Chevelle SS 454&quot; model was introduced, which used the Chevrolet LS6 big-block engine rated at , the highest factory rating at that time.

The fastest muscle car produced by American Motors was the mid-sized 1970 AMC Rebel &quot;The Machine&quot;, which was powered by a engine producing . The Rebel had a 0– time of 6.8 seconds and a quarter-mile run in 14.4 seconds at .

=== 1970s: Decline of the segment ===
The popularity of muscle cars declined through the early 1970s, due to factors including the Clean Air Act, the fuel crisis, and the increasing cost of insurance for these types of cars. The 1973 oil crisis resulted in rationing of fuel and higher prices. Muscle cars quickly became unaffordable and impractical for many people. In addition, the automobile insurance industry levied surcharges on all high-powered models.

Before the Clean Air Act of 1970, a majority of muscle cars came optioned with high-compression engines (some engines were as high as 11:1), which required high-octane fuel. Prior to 1970, 100-octane fuel was common. However, following the passage of the Clean Air Act of 1970, octane ratings were lowered to 91 (due in part to the removal of lead). Manufacturers reduced the compression ratio of engines, resulting in reduced performance. Simultaneously, efforts to combat air pollution focused Detroit&#x27;s attention on emissions control rather than increased power outputs.

=== 1980s–1990s: Performance revival ===
Muscle car performance began a resurgence in the early 1980s with high-output V8 engines introduced for the Ford Mustang GT, Chevrolet Camaro Z28, and Pontiac Firebird Formula/Trans Am. Initially using four-barrel carburetors, engine performance, and fuel economy were increased by the mid-1980s using electronic fuel injection systems and advanced engine management controls. Muscle car performance began to reappear on intermediate two-door coupés such as the Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS and Buick Regal. The Buick Regal used turbocharged V6 engines on the Grand National, Turbo-T, T-Type, and GNX models which rivaled the performance of V8 engines.

The few muscle cars remaining in production by the mid-1990s included the fourth generation Mustang, the 10th Generation Ford Thunderbird Super Coupe with it&#x27;s supercharged engine, the fourth generation Camaro, and fourth generation Firebird.

=== 2000s–present ===

For the 2004 model year, the Pontiac GTO was relaunched in the United States as a rebadged captive import version of the Holden Monaro. The model was to recreate the past versions, but the new version &quot;was nothing like the old aggressive and evocative model from the 60s&quot; and it was discontinued in 2006.

For 2005, Chrysler introduced muscle car heritage to high-performance V8-powered versions of four-door sedans, the Dodge Charger and Chrysler 300C, using nameplates traditionally used for two-door muscle cars. 

For 2005, the fifth-generation Ford Mustang, designed to resemble the original first-generation Mustang, brought back the aggressive lines and colors of the original. 

For the 2006 model year, GM relaunched the Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS with the first V8 engine on the Monte Carlo in 15 Years. The same V8 was used on the Monte Carlo&#x27;s W-Body sister cars like the Pontiac Grand Prix GXP, Buick Lacrosse Super, and the Chevrolet Impala SS. All Monte Carlo production ended on June 19, 2007, because of declining sales of coupe models in general as well as Chevrolet&#x27;s plan to reintroduce a new Camaro.

For 2008, Chrysler re-introduced the Dodge Challenger, which features styling links to the 1970 first-generation Challenger and was claimed by the Chrysler CEO to be &quot;a modern take on one of the most iconic muscle cars&quot;. 

A year later, running on that same sentiment, Chevrolet released the 2009 fifth-generation Camaro, which bears some resemblance to the 1969 first-generation Camaro.

== Australia ==
===Origins===

The first Australian-designed car to be marketed as a performance model was the 1963 Holden EH S4 model, of which 120 road cars were produced so that the model could be eligible to compete at the 1963 Armstrong 500 motor race at Bathurst. The EH S4 was powered by an upgraded version of the standard six-cylinder engine, enlarged to and producing . In 1964, the Ford Falcon (XM) became available with an enlarged &quot;Super Pursuit&quot; version of the standard six-cylinder engine, which produced .

In 1965, the Chrysler Valiant AP6 became the first Australian car to be available with a V8 engine. This optional engine was the version of the Chrysler LA engine, which produced and was imported from the United States. The first Australian-designed Ford to be available with a V8 was the 1966 Ford Falcon (XR), with a version of the Ford Windsor engine (imported from the United States), which produced . The first Holden to be available with a V8 was the 1968 Holden HK, with a version of the Chevrolet small-block V8 (imported from the United States) which produced . Later that year, a version of the engine became available in the Holden HK Monaro GTS 327 coupe.

The pinnacle of 1970s Australian muscle cars were the 1971–1972 Ford Falcon GTHO, Holden Monaro 350, and Chrysler Valiant Charger R/T (the smaller Holden Torana GTR was also a successful performance car of the era, but it is not considered a muscle car due to its prioritization of lighter weight over outright power output). The Ford Falcon (XY) GTHO Phase III model was powered by a version of the Ford Cleveland V8 engine, officially rated at , but estimated to produce between . The Holden HQ Monaro GTS 350 was powered by a version of the Chevrolet small-block V8 producing . The Chrysler Valiant Charger R/T E49 model was powered by a version of the Chrysler Hemi-6 six-cylinder engine producing .

===Supercar scare===
In 1972, the production of Australian muscle cars saw a setback when the Supercar scare caused Ford, Holden, and Chrysler to cease development of upcoming performance models, due to government pressure. The Australian muscle car models produced during the 1970s later consisted of the limited production 1977–1978 Holden Torana (LX) A9X option and the 1978–1979 Ford Falcon (XC) Cobra model, both created as homologation models for Group C touring car racing. These were less powerful than their predecessors. 

Brands still offered high-performance models with V8 variants throughout the 1980s, but these vehicles were low production and were generally underpowered compared to their late 1960s and 1970s predecessors. An example was the Ford Falcon (XD), which was available with a 5.8 L V8 engine. Subsequent generations of the Ford Falcon would not have any V8 options available until 1992, when the EB XR8 was introduced. The Holden Commodore debuted in 1978. However, a renaissance in muscle cars would be sparked by factory-backed aftermarket operations. Holden Dealer Team would release high-performance models of the Holden Commodore throughout the 1980s, such as the HDT Group A, which would become iconic for its blue paintwork. In 1988, Ford released the Ford Falcon (EB), which was available with a V8 in a 25th anniversary special model celebrating the original Ford Falcon GT.

== Argentina ==

In Argentina, local subsidiaries General Motors and Chrysler produced two acclaimed models of muscle cars, commercialising them under the Chevrolet and Dodge brands respectively. The first was the producer of the third American generation of the Chevrolet Nova, which in this country was renamed &quot;Chevy&quot;. This model was initially presented in a 4-door sedan version that maintained many physical features of the Nova coupe version, which would also be produced and marketed in Argentina a few years later.

On the other hand, Chrysler Fevre produced a series of vehicles based on the fourth generation of the Dodge Dart that received the name of &quot;Línea Dodge&quot; (Dodge Line). This vehicle presented sedan and coupe versions, which in turn were a local redesign of the Dart model and which, depending on its level of equipment, received different names (Polara, Coronado, RT, and GTX). 

In return for these brands, both Ford Argentina and the national producer Industrias Kaiser Argentina (&quot;IKA&quot;) would respond with the production of two high-performance sedans, such as the Argentine version of the Ford Falcon and a derivative of the AMC&#x27;s Rambler American model, called Torino, which, in addition to its sedan version, would present a coupe version which would end up being acclaimed and popularized in the Argentine automotive field. Production of the Torino would be resumed by Renault Argentina after it took over IKA in the 1970s.

<text>Liestal (, ), formerly spelled Liesthal, is the capital of Liestal District and the canton of Basel-Landschaft in Switzerland, south of Basel.

Liestal is an industrial town with a cobbled-street Old Town.

The official language of Liestal is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect.

==History==
The name &quot;Liestal&quot; was first mentioned in 1225, and the settlement dates at least from Roman times. The development of the town is due to its strategic location on the road between the first bridge over the Rhine at Basel and the St. Gotthard Pass.

Citizens of Liestal participated in the Burgundian Wars in 1476 and 1477 against Charles the Bold. In 1501, the mayor swore allegiance to the Swiss Confederation, and this caused repeated conflict with neighboring Rheinfelden, which belonged to the Habsburgs.

In the 17th century, Liestal rebelled against Basel as part of the Farmers&#x27; Rebellion and was occupied by troops from that city. Three leaders of the rebellion were beheaded in Basel.

In 1789, the town enthusiastically hailed the French call for freedom and equality. It celebrated Napoleon, when he traveled through town in 1797. After his fall, the earlier subjection to Basel was re-established.

The French July Revolution of 1830 also caused upheaval in Liestal. A provisional government was established, and the town was chosen as the capital of a new canton on 17 March 1832.

<doc id="228463" wikidata="Q2556435" url="?curid=228463" title="Rattanbai Jinnah">
<text>Rattanbai Jinnah or Maryam Jinnah (&quot;née&quot; Petit; 20 February 1900 – 20 February 1929), also known as Ruttie Petit, was the wife of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, an important figure in the creation of Pakistan and the country&#x27;s founder. 

Petit belonged to two of the most influential families of the Indian Subcontinent, the Petit family, through her father and the Jinnah family through her marriage to Jinnah. Her daughter Dina Wadia married Bombay Dyeing chairman Neville Wadia, of the Wadia family.

==Early life and background==
Rattanbai Petit (often informally called &quot;Ruttie&quot;) was born on 20 February 1900 in Bombay, Bombay Presidency, British India, into the extremely affluent and well-connected Petit family that belonged to the Parsi community. She was the only daughter of the businessman Sir Dinshaw Petit, the second baronet Petit, and his wife Lady Dinabai Petit. Her paternal grandfather, Dinshaw Maneckji Petit, the first baronet, had built some of the earliest cotton mills in India. He was also a philanthropist who aided the Zoroastrians of Iran who were persecuted by the Qajars. Her brother, Fali, who later became Sir Dinshaw Maneckji Petit, the 3rd Baronet, was married to Sylla Tata, a member of the Tata family. Her other brother was Jamshed Petit. Rattanbai’s uncle, Bomanjee Dinshaw Petit and cousin, Jehangir Bomanji Petit, were noted industrialists, and her cousin was the activist Mithuben Petit. 

Rattanbai Petit was famous in Bombay. Not only was she the well-read, fashionable, extroverted, and nationalistic daughter of the 2nd Baronet, she was considered beautiful. As she entered her late teens she was called &quot;The Flower of Bombay&quot; by the city&#x27;s high society, many of which were frequent guests in her father&#x27;s home.

The Petits were an extremely anglicized family that strove to be fully British in manner, dress, language, diet, and customs. The 2nd Baronet would import only the finest flowers, marble, and furniture from Europe for his home. Every room had multiple Persian rugs, and Petit Hall even had a Grecian fountain. Unsurprisingly, they spared their children almost no luxuries. Ruttie&#x27;s father would shower her with gifts of books, clothes, pets, sweets, gourmet meals, and vacations to Europe or other parts of India where they owned homes. Ruttie was a huge lover of fashion and was allowed to go shopping unattended and purchase anything she wanted; with no spending limits. Her parents left most of the raising of their children to European nannies. While her paternal grandparents were practising orthodox Zoroastrians, Ruttie was agnostic and only nominally a Parsi. None of the Petit children were raised in Zoroastrianism, nor was Gujarati spoken in the home. Ruttie and her brothers did receive Navjote ceremonies, but they were only done as an excuse to throw a grand party afterward.

==Courtship and wedding==
Muhammad Ali Jinnah, then 42, was only three years younger than Ruttie&#x27;s father, and the two men were good friends. Jinnah was a frequent guest at Petit Hall, the sprawling seaside residence of the Petit family at the foot of Malabar Hill in Mumbai. It was in this setting that Ruttie and Jinnah became acquainted. They were both nationalists, loved horses, and were avidly interested in politics. Their romance, however, started in Darjeeling, while the two were thrown together on a vacation by her unsuspecting family. Despite an age difference of twenty-four years, and the fact that Ruttie was sixteen at the time, the two decided to get married. 
Jinnah broached the topic with his friend by first discussing the question of interfaith and inter-community marriages, always a controversial topic in India. Here he was sure of drawing a favorable response from the baronet. Having drawn his friend out to make a general statement in support of mixed marriages, Jinnah then made his proposal to marry his friend&#x27;s daughter. The baronet was shocked beyond words; he had never imagined anything other than a benign paternalistic relationship between his friend and his daughter. He reacted with violent indignation to the idea and almost ordered Jinnah out of his house. From the Petits&#x27; point of view, it was not just the question of religion, but also that of the age difference, especially given that Jinnah was 40, that appalled them.

&quot;She was, after all, not yet sixteen, an age when modern parents of the new century did not expect their daughters to rush into marriage, although in more conventional homes girls were either betrothed or already married by that age. Sir Dinshaw’s only sister, Humabai, after having gone to a French boarding school in Nice for her baccalaureate, was still single at twenty-nine and not an eyebrow was raised.&quot;

Since Ruttie was underage, her father was able to prevent the marriage for the time being, and the matter brewed for more than a year with no resolution. Ruttie was the only daughter (she had three brothers) of her parents, and they always celebrated her birthday in grand style. Despite the tensions within the family, they could hardly give her coming-of-age birthday a miss, and a grand banquet was held on the occasion at the Taj Mahal Hotel in Mumbai. After the baronet had regaled his guests with a witty after-dinner speech, Ruttie stood up saying &quot;Thank you, Papa...&quot; and went on to drop a bombshell. She calmly informed the gathering that she had accepted a proposal of marriage from Jinnah, and that they would be married shortly; she asked the audience to wish them joy. She sat down to thundering silence, but despite the palpable outrage and opposition, a matter which had become so public could not be undone, and Ruttie could not be persuaded to change her mind. Even to the end, her parents could never reconcile themselves to the turn of events. Their objections were manifold: the difference of religion, the vast difference in age, the feeling of having been betrayed by a man they had always regarded as a friend. When the time came for Ruttie to abandon the Parsi community and be received into the Muslim community, she was disowned and thrown off by her family and had to leave her father&#x27;s house forthwith. In 1918, only weeks after her 18th birthday, Ruttie converted to Islam, married the 42-year-old Muhammad Ali Jinnah, in an Islamic wedding, and cut all ties with her family and the Parsi community.&lt;ref name=&quot;dawn/3march2012&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Parsi community was outraged at not only Ruttie, but also her parents. After the marriage of Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata to the Frenchwoman Suzanne Brière, (who later converted to Zoroastrianism), many conservative Parsis were concerned of the rapid anglicization, indifference to religion, and materialistic lifestyle of the Parsi elite. Furthermore, most Parsi youth of Ruttie&#x27;s age from wealthy families at the time were either indifferent to religion or full-blown atheists, and their parents did precious little to educate them religiously. After the marriage of Jinnah and Ruttie, it was the final straw and the conservative Parsis and mobeds called for all of their youth to be religiously re-educated. Regarding the Petit family, they were given two choices by the Parsi Panchayat. They could either be excommunicated along with their daughter, or remain within the community provided they publicly disinherit their daughter and sever all contact with her. Her family chose the latter, but Lady Dinshaw strove to be a part of her granddaughter&#x27;s life, and was able to do so after Ruttie and Jinnah separated.

==Marital problems==
The Jinnahs resided mainly at South Court Mansion in Malabar Hill, a stone&#x27;s throw from Petit Hall. However, there was no contact between them and the Petit family, and the estrangement continued even after the birth of Ruttie&#x27;s only child, Dina Wadia, the following year. In addition to the estrangement from her own family, Ruttie was also ex-communicated from the Parsi Community with extraordinary measures and censure, and a complete ostracization from their social gatherings.

When Ruttie moved in with her pets, she came to what was essentially an empty house. At the very beginning of their marriage, Jinnah surrendered his home and his closet to her. She was allowed to completely furbish the house exactly the way she liked it. In regard to Jinnah&#x27;s wardrobe, Jinnah knew she had an eye for fashionable clothes, and allowed her to not only buy and coordinate his suits but also style his hair. Undoubtedly, Jinnah benefited from this arrangement as it presented him politically as a fashionable, modern Muslim man. They also made frequent trips to Europe and spent considerable lengths of time there. They made for a head-turning couple, not just because they looked an unlikely mismatched pair, but also because Ruttie aspired to define the acme of fashion and money was absolutely no object. Her long hair would be decked in fresh flowers, she wore vibrant silks and chiffons, accentuated by headbands and tiaras lavish with diamonds, rubies and emeralds. Her main choice of dress was a sleeveless blouse with chiffon saris. Her daring wardrobe would not only shock the Muslim community, but also the British. Despite this, Jinnah doted on his childlike bride and indulged her every wish, and she was likewise content to be pampered by her beloved husband whom she called “J”. According to most sources, the couple could not have been happier in their first few years of marriage. Their only child, Dina Jinnah, was born prematurely on 15 August 1919. Dina was severely neglected by both her parents during the first 8 years of her life. Jinnah was preoccupied with politics, and Ruttie left their daughter to the care of nannies and servants. In fact, Dina was not given a name by either of her parents.

Jinnah&#x27;s sister Fatima Jinnah, who had been a ward of Jinnah from age eight, since their father&#x27;s death in 1901, was not amenable to the marriage either. In an attempt to make way for the new bride, Fatima was initially bundled off to another sister&#x27;s home, but later had come to spending her Sundays at the Jinnah residence at South Court. The young Ruttie, already a mother at 19, found that she was no longer the sole recipient of Jinnah&#x27;s attentions. It did not help that she and Fatima were of very different temperaments. Ruttie had even yelled at Fatima (considered dour, and very close in personal characteristics in her austerity and fastidiousness, to Jinnah) once, upon seeing her reading the Quran regularly, “the Quran is a book to be talked about, not to be read!” Jinnah enrolled Fatima in a Dental College in 1919. In 1923, he also helped Fatima Jinnah set up her own clinic in Bombay. Yet, this did little in bridging the gap that had developed between Jinnah and Ruttie.

By mid-1922, Jinnah was facing political isolation (almost reflecting Ruttie&#x27;s own ex-communication from the Parsi Community), as he devoted every spare moment to be the voice of separatist incitement in a nation torn by Hindu-Muslim antipathy. His increasingly late hours and the ever-increasing distance between them left Ruttie feeling neglected. The infatuation had worn out, and Jinnah found the demands made on him onerous and vexatious. The change was not something which Ruttie could understand or accept. Her complex relationship with her husband can be gleaned by reading some extracts of her last letter to him:

::&quot;...When one has been as near to the reality of Life (which after all is Death) as I have been, dearest, one only remembers the beautiful and tender moments and all the rest becomes a half veiled mist of unrealities. Try and remember me, beloved, as the flower you plucked and not the flower you tread upon...&quot; and late in the letter, &quot;.. Darling I love you – I love you – and had I loved you just a little less I might have remained with you – only after one has created a very beautiful blossom one does not drag it through the mire. The higher you set your ideal the lower it falls. I have loved you my darling as it is given to few men to be loved. I only beseech you that the tragedy which commenced in love should also end with it...&quot;.

==Last days and death==

After Ruttie and Jinnah separated, their daughter was able to meet Ruttie&#x27;s mother. Lady Petit became very close to her granddaughter, and due their closeness Dina chose to take her maternal grandmother&#x27;s first name.

Ruttie Jinnah developed intestinal ailments with cancer speculated to be the cause. She also suffered from depression, which was not well understood at the time. In early 1928, she moved into a suite at Bombay&#x27;s Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, leaving Jinnah home with eight-year-old Dina. That spring, while visiting Paris with her mother, Ruttie fell into an unexplained coma and almost died. Two months later, on 19 February 1929, Ruttie fell unconscious in her room at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Mumbai. She died the next day, her 29th birthday.

There is no official medical record stating the cause of her death, so there are many speculations that range from cancer to colitis. Jinnah was in Delhi at the time, so he didn&#x27;t find out about his wife&#x27;s death until his father-in-law called him from Bombay to inform him that Ruttie had died. She was buried at the Khoja Shia Ishna Ashari Jamaat Arambaug Cemetery in Bombay.

Years after the death of his wife, Jinnah confided to a friend, &quot;she was a child, I shouldn’t have married her. It was my mistake&quot;, referring to what Jinnah considered as &quot;childish behavior&quot; of Ruttie. Further, in an irony of sorts, his own stance on inter-faith and inter-community marriages was challenged when his daughter Dina decided to marry the Parsi industrialist Neville Wadia. In almost exactly the same way Sir Dinshaw Petit and Ruttie clashed, Jinnah too clashed with Dina over her desire to marry outside the Muslim community. Mahommed Ali Karim Chagla, who was Jinnah&#x27;s assistant at the time, writes in his autobiography Roses in December: &quot;Jinnah asked Dina ‘there are millions of Muslim boys in India, is he the only one you were waiting for?’ and Dina replied ‘there were millions of Muslim girls in India, why did you marry my mother then?’&quot; His response to her was, &quot;She became a Muslim.&quot;

Muhammad Ali Jinnah is seen as a very private person who hardly showed his emotions, but he is known to have wept twice in public, and both occasions were connected to Ruttie. One of the occasions was Ruttie&#x27;s funeral in 1929, and the other was in August 1947, when he visited her grave one last time before leaving for Pakistan. Jinnah left India in August 1947, never to return again.

After Ruttie&#x27;s death and Dina&#x27;s marriage, it appeared that Jinnah missed them a great deal. G. Allana wrote a biography of Jinnah entitled &quot;Quaid-i-Azam Jinnah: The Story of a Nation,&quot; and he relates an anecdote made known to him by Jinnah&#x27;s chauffeur. He quoted the chauffeur thus:

::&quot;You know servants in household come to know everything that is going around them. Sometimes more than twelve years after Begum Jinnah&#x27;s (Mrs. Jinnah) death, the boss would order at dead of night a huge ancient wooden chest to be opened, in which were stored clothes of his dead wife and his married daughter. He would intently look into those clothes, as they were taken out of box and were spread on the carpets. He would gaze at them for long with eloquent silence. Then his eyes turn moisten...&quot;

<doc id="228464" wikidata="Q675597" url="?curid=228464" title="Athletics at the 1900 Summer Olympics">
<text>At the 1900 Summer Olympics, twenty-three athletics events were contested. Altogether, 117 athletes from 15 nations competed. A total of 68 medals (23 gold, 23 silver, 22 bronze) were awarded. In many countries, due in part to the conflation of the Olympic Games and the World&#x27;s Fair in Paris, the media discussed only the athletics events under the &quot;Olympic&quot; name while ignoring the incredible variety of other sports featured at the time.

The 23 events listed are those currently considered to have been of Olympic stature by the International Olympic Committee and most Olympic historians. They exclude all events that used a handicap system, as well as all events which were open to professional athletes. The IOC has never decided which events were &quot;Olympic&quot; and which were not.

Competitions were held on 14 July, 15 July, 16 July, 19 July, and 22 July. This included Bastille Day, which is a French holiday, and then Sunday, which many of the American athletes protested. Even with many Americans not competing in finals because of confusion caused by the organizers&#x27; decision to count scores achieved on Monday, 16 July for finals held on Sunday, 15 July and subsequent rescission of that decision, the United States won more than 4 times as many medals as any other nation, including 16 of the 23 gold medals.

The conditions of competition were also subpar compared even to those at the previous games in 1896. There was no track for the Paris Games, as a grass field dotted with trees and of unequal elevation was used. The course was 500 metres in length, an unusual distance for a track.

==Medal summary==

These medals are retroactively assigned by the International Olympic Committee; at the time, winners were given silver medals.
==Daily summary==
===14 July===
* All rounds, including the finals, for the 100 metres and the 110 metre hurdles were held. The United States took 5 of the medals, missing only the bronze medal in the 100 metres won by Stan Rowley of Australia. Frank Jarvis won the 100 metres, with Alvin Kraenzlein taking the gold in the 110 metre hurdles.
* In the 400 metre heats, the United States took 5 qualifying spots for the final while Denmark secured the last one. The 800 metres was more balanced, with 3 Americans and one athlete each from France, Great Britain, and Hungary.
* The 400 metre hurdles semifinals eliminated only one athlete, with the other four advancing to the finals.
* Defending discus and shot put champion Robert Garrett failed to make a mark in the qualification round of the discus throw, but did advance to the final in the shot put. Bohemia advanced a thrower in the discus, an event which saw 5 athletes from 5 different nations qualify.
* Surprising few, Kraenzlein and Meyer Prinstein took the top two spots in the long jump qualification, moving to the final along with a third American, a Briton, and a Frenchman.

===15 July===
* In a busy day for the athletics program, 10 finals were held along with the semifinals of the 60 metres (which was one of the events with a final that day). The United States took 7 of the championships, with Great Britain, Canada, and Hungary each picking up one.
* Kraenzlein took the top spots in the 60 metres and the long jump, the latter victory allegedly earning him a punch in the face from Prinstein, who had not competed because the final was held on a Sunday. This brought Kraenzlein&#x27;s total to 3 gold medals, better than any athlete had done four years earlier. Irving Baxter also took gold in two events, the high jump and the pole vault.
* Denmark won its first athletics medal, with a bronze in the 400 metres. Charles Bennett&#x27;s gold in the 1500 metres gave Britain its first gold in the sport. Canadian George Orton took two medals, a gold and a bronze, but did so while representing the United States. Hungary won its first gold with the discus throw, adding a bronze in the high jump. Bohemia, another nation making its debut, took the silver medal in the discus.
* The steeplechase made its Olympic debut, with the 2500 metre version won by Orton.

===16 July===
* Eight more finals were held on Monday the 16th. Kraenzlein picked up a fourth victory with the 200 metre hurdles, winning both his semifinal and the final to set a long-lived Olympic record for athletic gold medals in individual events. Ray Ewry won all three of the standing jumps, each of which made its Olympic debut in 1900. Great Britain picked up another pair of gold medals with the 800 metres and the 4000 metre steeplechase. Prinstein got his long-awaited victory in the triple jump, while John Flanagan&#x27;s hammer throw earned the United States its 6th championship of the day.
* India&#x27;s debut Games reached a high point with Norman Pritchard&#x27;s silver medal in the 200 metre hurdles.

===19 July===
* The marathon was the only event held on the 19th. Michel Théato, a Luxembourgish citizen under the French flag, won the gold medal. Sweden earned its first athletics medal with the bronze in the marathon.

===22 July===
* The two remaining events were held on Sunday the 22nd. The semifinals and finals of the 200 metres and the 5000 metre team race were held.
* Pritchard won his second silver medal in the 200 metres, while Rowley won his third bronze in the same event. The race was won by Walter Tewksbury, bringing his total for the Games to five medals, including two gold medals.
* The 5000 metre team race was won by the British team, which included Stan Rowley of Australia. This makes Rowley the only athlete in Olympic history to win gold medals for multiple nations in the same Games; the establishment of National Olympic Committees ensures this accomplishment will remain unique. Also of note is that Rowley did not finish the race: it was far longer than the sprinter was accustomed to running, and after he had been injured and reduced to walking, he retired after everyone else had crossed the finish line to accept last place.

<doc id="228467" wikidata="Q2039348" url="?curid=228467" title="Municipalities of the Netherlands">
<text>Since 1 January 2023, there have been 342 regular municipalities ( ; sing.  ) and three special municipalities ( ) in the Netherlands. The latter is the status of three of the six island territories that make up the Dutch Caribbean. Municipalities are the second-level administrative division, or public bodies (), in the Netherlands and are subdivisions of their respective provinces. Their duties are delegated to them by the central government and they are ruled by a municipal council that is elected every four years. Municipal mergers have reduced the total number of municipalities by two-thirds since the first official boundaries were created in the mid 19th century. Municipalities themselves are informally subdivided into districts and neighbourhoods for administrative and statistical purposes.

These municipalities come in a wide range of sizes, Westervoort is the smallest with a land area of and Súdwest-Fryslân the largest with a land area of . Schiermonnikoog is both the least populated, with 972 people, and the least densely populated municipality at . Amsterdam has the highest population with 931,298 residents as of January 2024, whereas The Hague is the most densely populated with a density of .

== Municipal status ==
As a second level administrative division municipalities are the third tier of public administration in the Netherlands after the central government and the provinces. The Netherlands is a decentralized unitary state, which means that the central government is supreme and delegates certain tasks to lower levels of government by law. The different levels do, however, make work agreements, which give municipalities a certain degree of independence in their policy decisions. Municipalities are responsible for a wide variety of public services, which include land-use planning, public housing, management and maintenance of local roads, waste management and social security. After the Dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles in 2010 three special municipalities (officially public bodies) were formed. These municipalities function the same as regular municipalities and are grouped together as the Caribbean Netherlands and are not part of a province.

The municipalities are governed by both a board of mayor and aldermen and a municipal council. The municipal council, which is titled island council in the special municipalities, is elected every four years. The number of members in the council ranges from nine members for the smallest municipalities to forty-five members for the largest. It is the highest administrative body in the municipality and controls public policy. The executive power lies with the executive board, which consists of a mayor, titled lieutenant governor in the special municipalities, and multiple aldermen, titled island deputies in the special municipalities. The mayor is appointed for six years at a time by the crown and the alderman are elected by the municipal council, typically after each municipal election. The mayor is responsible for public order and is the first in command during emergencies, all other tasks are distributed freely between mayor and aldermen. The exact portfolio for each person differs between each municipality.
Official municipal boundaries were first drawn up in 1832 in the Netherlands after a cadastre was formed. The &quot;Municipalities Act&quot; of 1851, written by prime minister Thorbecke, led to the disappearance of small municipalities. Throughout the years, less populous municipalities have been merged. They were either added to the larger neighbouring cities or multiple smaller municipalities merged into a larger new municipality with a new name. The number of municipalities reduced from 1,209 in 1850 to 537 in 2000; since 2024 there have been 342 municipalities. During this time, multiple mergers occurred simultaneously in large parts of individual provinces; the municipal boundaries were basically redrawn in these regions. In the 19th and large parts of the 20th century, municipal mergers were forced by the central government. This policy changed in the end of the 20th century; local support for the merger is now a large part of the decision-making process. The larger, merged municipalities are intended to handle an increasing workload because more public services are delegated from higher levels of government to the municipalities. Another reason for municipal mergers is the assumption that larger municipalities are more efficient in performing their tasks than smaller ones.

Municipalities have the right to decentralise themselves and form submunicipalities as an additional level of government. This right and the submunicipalities will cease to exist in the near future to reduce the number of levels of government. Only Amsterdam, where the districts are called , as well as Rotterdam, where the districts are called , consist of such formal subdivisions. The Hague, Almere, Breda, Eindhoven, Enschede, Groningen, Nijmegen, Tilburg and Utrecht have instituted as well, although they do not have the same legal submunicipal status. For administrative use by municipalities and data collection by Statistics Netherlands all municipalities are subdivided into districts (), which in turn are subdivided into neighbourhoods (). These subdivisions have, in contrast to the submunicipalities, no formal status.

<text>In spark-ignition internal combustion engines, knocking (also knock, detonation, spark knock, pinging or pinking) occurs when combustion of some of the air/fuel mixture in the cylinder does not result from propagation of the flame front ignited by the spark plug, but when one or more pockets of air/fuel mixture explode outside the envelope of the normal combustion front. The fuel–air charge is meant to be ignited by the spark plug only, and at a precise point in the piston&#x27;s stroke. Knock occurs when the peak of the combustion process no longer occurs at the optimum moment for the four-stroke cycle. The shock wave creates the characteristic metallic &quot;pinging&quot; sound, and cylinder pressure increases dramatically. Effects of engine knocking range from inconsequential to completely destructive.

Knocking should not be confused with pre-ignition—they are two separate events. However, pre-ignition can be followed by knocking.

The phenomenon of detonation was described in November 1914 in a letter from Lodge Brothers (spark plug manufacturers, and sons of Sir Oliver Lodge) settling a discussion regarding the cause of &quot;knocking&quot; or &quot;pinging&quot; in motorcycles. In the letter they stated that an early ignition can give rise to the gas detonating instead of the usual expansion, and the sound that is produced by the detonation is the same as if the metal parts had been tapped with a hammer. It was further investigated and described by Harry Ricardo during experiments carried out between 1916 and 1919 to discover the reason for failures in aircraft engines.

==Normal combustion==
Under ideal conditions the common internal combustion engine burns the fuel/air mixture in the cylinder in an orderly and controlled fashion. The combustion is started by the spark plug some 10 to 40 crankshaft degrees prior to top dead center (TDC), depending on many factors including engine speed and load. This ignition advance allows time for the combustion process to develop peak pressure at the ideal time for maximum recovery of work from the expanding gases.

The spark across the spark plug&#x27;s electrodes forms a small kernel of flame approximately the size of the spark plug gap. As it grows in size, its heat output increases, which allows it to grow at an accelerating rate, expanding rapidly through the combustion chamber. This growth is due to the travel of the flame front through the combustible fuel–air mix itself, and due to Rayleigh–Taylor instability (resulting from the hot, low-density combustion gasses expanding into the relatively cold and dense unburnt fuel–air mix) which rapidly stretches the burning zone into a complex of fingers of burning gas that have a much greater surface area than a simple spherical ball of flame would have (this latter process is enhanced and accelerated by any pre-existing turbulence in the fuel–air mixture). In normal combustion, this flame front moves throughout the fuel/air mixture at a rate characteristic for the particular mixture. Pressure rises smoothly to a peak, as nearly all the available fuel is consumed, then pressure falls as the piston descends. Maximum cylinder pressure is achieved a few crankshaft degrees after the piston passes TDC, so that the force applied on the piston (from the increasing pressure applied to the top surface of the piston) can give its hardest push precisely when the piston&#x27;s speed and mechanical advantage on the crank shaft gives the best recovery of force from the expanding gases, thus maximizing torque transferred to the crankshaft.

==Abnormal combustion==
When unburned fuel–air mixture beyond the boundary of the flame front is subjected to a combination of heat and pressure for a certain duration (beyond the delay period of the fuel used), detonation may occur. Detonation is characterized by an almost instantaneous, explosive ignition of at least one pocket of fuel/air mixture outside of the flame front. A local shockwave is created around each pocket, and the cylinder pressure will rise sharply – and possibly beyond its design limits – causing damage. (Detonation is actually more efficient than deflagration, but is usually avoided due to its damaging effects on engine components.)

If detonation is allowed to persist under extreme conditions or over many engine cycles, engine parts can be damaged or destroyed. The simplest deleterious effect is particle wear caused by moderate knocking, with the resulting particulate dispersing into the engine&#x27;s oil system causing abrasive wear on other parts prior to being trapped by the oil filter. Such wear gives the appearance of erosion, abrasion, or a &quot;sandblasted&quot; look, similar to the damage caused by hydraulic cavitation. Severe knocking can lead to catastrophic failure in the form of physical holes melted and pushed through the piston or cylinder head (i.e. rupture of the combustion chamber), either of which depressurizes the affected cylinder and introduces large metal fragments, fuel, and combustion products into the oil system. Hypereutectic pistons are known to break easily from such shock waves.

Detonation can be prevented by any or all of the following techniques:
* retarding ignition timing
* the use of a fuel with high octane rating, which increases the combustion temperature of the fuel and reduces the proclivity to detonate
* enriching the air–fuel ratio which alters the chemical reactions during combustion, reduces the combustion temperature and increases the margin to detonation
* reducing peak cylinder pressure
* decreasing the manifold pressure by reducing the throttle opening or boost pressure
* reducing the load on the engine

Because pressure and temperature are strongly linked, knock can also be attenuated by controlling peak combustion chamber temperatures by compression ratio reduction, exhaust gas recirculation, appropriate calibration of the engine&#x27;s ignition timing schedule, and careful design of the engine&#x27;s combustion chambers and cooling system as well as controlling the initial air intake temperature.

The addition of tetraethyl lead (TEL), a soluble organolead compound added to gasoline, was common until it was discontinued for reasons of toxic pollution. Lead dust added to the intake charge will also reduce knock with various hydrocarbon fuels. Manganese compounds are also used to reduce knock with petrol fuel.

Knock is less common in cold climates. As an aftermarket solution, a water injection system can be employed to reduce combustion chamber peak temperatures and thus suppress detonation. Steam (water vapor) will suppress knock even though no added cooling is supplied.

Turbulence, as stated, has a very important effect on knock. Engines with good turbulence tend to knock less than engines with poor turbulence. Turbulence occurs not only while the engine is inhaling but also when the mixture is compressed and burned. Many pistons are designed to use &quot;squish&quot; turbulence to violently mix the air and fuel together as they are ignited and burned, which reduces knock greatly by speeding up burning and cooling the unburnt mixture. One example of this is all modern side valve or flathead engines. A considerable portion of the head space is made to come in close proximity to the piston crown, making for much turbulence near TDC. In the early days of side valve heads this was not done and a much lower compression ratio had to be used for any given fuel. Also such engines were sensitive to ignition advance and had less power.

Knocking is more or less unavoidable in diesel engines, where fuel is injected into highly compressed air towards the end of the compression stroke. There is a short lag between the fuel being injected and combustion starting. By this time there is already a quantity of fuel in the combustion chamber which will ignite first in areas of greater oxygen density prior to the combustion of the complete charge. This sudden increase in pressure and temperature causes the distinctive diesel &#x27;knock&#x27; or &#x27;clatter&#x27;, some of which must be allowed for in the engine design.

Careful design of the injector pump, fuel injector, combustion chamber, piston crown and cylinder head can reduce knocking greatly, and modern engines using electronic common rail injection have very low levels of knock. Engines using indirect injection generally have lower levels of knock than direct injection engines, due to the greater dispersal of oxygen in the combustion chamber and lower injection pressures providing a more complete mixing of fuel and air. Diesels actually do not suffer exactly the same &quot;knock&quot; as gasoline engines since the cause is known to be only the very fast rate of pressure rise, not unstable combustion. Diesel fuels are actually very prone to knock in gasoline engines but in the diesel engine there is no time for knock to occur because the fuel is only oxidized during the expansion cycle. In the gasoline engine the fuel is slowly oxidizing all the time while it is being compressed before the spark. This allows for changes to occur in the structure/makeup of the molecules before the very critical period of high temperature/pressure.

==Knock detection==

Due to the large variation in fuel quality, atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature as well as the possibility of a malfunction, every modern combustion engine contains mechanisms to detect and prevent knocking.

A control loop is permanently monitoring the signal of one or more knock sensors (commonly piezoelectric sensor which are able to translate vibrations into an electric signal). If the characteristic pressure peak of a knocking combustion is detected the ignition timing is retarded by steps of a few degrees. If the signal normalizes indicating a controlled combustion the ignition timing is advanced again in the same fashion keeping the engine at its best possible operating point - the so-called ″knock limit″. Modern knock control-loop systems are able to adjust ignition timings for every cylinder individually. Depending on the specific engine the boost pressure is regulated simultaneously. This way performance is kept at its optimum while mostly eliminating the risk of engine damage caused by knock (e.g. when running on low octane fuel). An early example of this is in turbocharged Saab H engines, where a system called Automatic Performance Control was used to reduce boost pressure if it caused the engine to knock.

==Knock prediction==
Since the avoidance of knocking combustion is so important to development engineers, a variety of simulation technologies have been developed which can identify engine design or operating conditions in which knock might be expected to occur. This then enables engineers to design ways to mitigate knocking combustion whilst maintaining a high thermal efficiency.

Since the onset of knock is sensitive to the in-cylinder pressure, temperature and autoignition chemistry associated with the local mixture compositions within the combustion chamber, simulations which account for all of these aspects have thus proven most effective in determining knock operating limits and enabling engineers to determine the most appropriate operating strategy.

==Knock control==
The objective of knock control strategies is to attempt to optimize the trade-off between protecting the engine from damaging knock events and maximizing the engine&#x27;s output torque. Knock events are an independent random process. It is impossible to design knock controllers in a deterministic platform. A single time history simulation or experiment of knock control methods are not able to provide a repeatable measurement of controller&#x27;s performance because of the random nature of arriving knock events. Therefore, the desired trade-off must be done in a stochastic framework which could provide a suitable environment for designing and evaluating different knock control strategies performances with rigorous statistical properties.

<text>A cricket match was played as part of the 1900 Summer Olympics, took place on 19–20 August at the Vélodrome de Vincennes between teams representing Great Britain and France.

Great Britain won the match by 158 runs. The French team included ten British nationals, two of whom were born in France, and two Frenchmen: as such, it is considered to be a mixed team, though it is currently listed by the IOC as representing France.

Originally, four teams entered - Belgium, France, Great Britain, and the Netherlands - and they were scheduled to compete in a knockout tournament, with the semi-finals scheduled for August 4–5 and August 11–12, and the final scheduled for August 19–20.

However, Belgium and the Netherlands both withdrew before the draw as the Netherlands were unable to field a complete cricket team, while Belgium did not send their cricket team to Paris. Therefore, the semi-finals were scratched, and Great Britain played France in a single match on the dates originally scheduled for the final.

Neither team was nationally selected: the British side was a touring club, the Devon and Somerset Wanderers (alias &quot;Devon County Wanderers&quot;), while the French team, the French Athletic Club Union, was composed mainly of British expatriates living in Paris.

The two-day match commenced on 19 August 1900. Great Britain batted first and scored 117, and bowled France out for 78. Great Britain then scored 145 for 5 in their second innings and declared, setting the hosts a target of 185 to win: Great Britain then bowled out France for 26 to win the match by 158 runs, a significant margin, but with only five minutes remaining before stumps. The Great Britain team was awarded silver medals and the French team bronze medals, together with miniature statues of the Eiffel Tower.

While 1900 is the only Olympiad where cricket was part of the official programme, it will return at the 2028 Games in the Twenty20 format. All events which were restricted to amateurs, open to all nations, open to all competitors, and without handicapping, are now regarded as Olympic events (except for ballooning). The IOC has never decided which events were &quot;Olympic&quot; and which were not.

==Background==

Cricket had been scheduled as an event at the first modern Olympics in 1896, being listed in the original programme for the Athens Games, and would have been the only team event at the Games, but the tournament was cancelled due to a lack of entries.

Four years later, at the Paris Games, there was also a shortage of entries: Belgium and the Netherlands both withdrew before the draw. Their withdrawal left only Great Britain and the host nation, France, to participate.

The slightly haphazard nature of the cricket tournament was mirrored throughout the rest of the 1900 Olympics: events took place throughout a six-month period from May through October, and like the Games themselves, were often considered part of the Exposition Universelle, a world&#x27;s fair held in Paris from 15 April until 12 November 1900.

==Team selection==
Neither side was nationally selected, nor representative. Great Britain, or England as they were called in the advertising handbills, were represented by a touring club side, the Devon and Somerset Wanderers. The side, formed by William Donne in 1894 for a tour of the Isle of Wight, had completed five other tours before travelling to France.

The Wanderers were primarily formed from players of Castle Cary Cricket Club, five of whom played in the match, and also included four former pupils of Blundell&#x27;s School, a public school in Devon. The side was completed by a number of players from the surrounding areas who were able to get away from business and personal commitments for the two-week period of the tour. Writing in the Journal of Olympic History, Ian Buchanan describes that both sides &quot;were made up of distinctly average club cricketers&quot;. Only two members of the Wanderers side, and none of the French side, played first-class cricket. Montagu Toller played six times for Somerset County Cricket Club, all in 1897, while Alfred Bowerman played for Somerset once in 1900, and again in 1905.

The French side was officially drawn from all the member clubs of the Union des Sociétés Françaises de Sports Athlétiques. As few of these clubs actually sported cricket teams, and so the eventual side was selected from just two clubs: the Union Club and the Standard Athletic Club. Both sides had strong English influences, and the majority of the team that competed for France in the Olympic match were British expatriates; the Standard Athletic Club had been formed ten years earlier by English workers who had moved to the country to help build the Eiffel Tower.

==Match==

===Summary===

The match had been intended to be a standard eleven-a-side contest, but by mutual agreement from the captains this was increased to twelve-a-side, a move which the scorecard printers had not expected: extra names had to be added by hand.

Play commenced at 11:00AM on Sunday, 19 August, with the touring Wanderers batting first. They were bowled out for 117, with only four members of the team reaching double figures. Frederick Cuming, one of the four Old Blundellians, top-scored for the side with 38, followed by their captain, and Exeter Cricket Club opening batsman, C. B. K. Beachcroft with 23. The French were then bowled out for 78, the bowling led by Frederick Christian who claimed seven wickets. Play closed at 5:00PM after both sides had completed their first innings, and the Wanderers had a lead of 39 runs. The Wanderers batting improved the following morning, and they added 145 runs for the second innings, declaring their innings closed with five wickets down. Beachcroft was again successful, reaching a half-century, a feat also achieved by Bowerman, who top-scored with 59 runs.

The French required 185 runs to win, but lost their first ten wickets for eleven runs. At this point they attempted to play out time, which would have meant the match was drawn. The match was just five minutes from the end when their eleventh, and final, wicket fell, granting the Wanderers a 158-run victory.

Toller was the pick of the Wanderers bowlers in the second innings, claiming seven wickets and conceding nine runs.

After the match, the English side were awarded silver medals, and the French side were given bronze medals, and both teams were also given miniature statues of the Eiffel Tower. The match was not covered in any national newspapers in England or France, although some of the local Devon and West Country newspapers did publish reports.

===Scorecard===


;Scorecard notes

:a. The published total in the French Athletic Club Union&#x27;s first innings is two more than the totals of the batsmen&#x27;s runs and the extras.
:b. Bowling details for overs, maidens and runs conceded are unavailable with the exception of runs conceded in the French Athletic Club Union&#x27;s second innings, where some information has been recorded.
==Aftermath==
The Devon and Somerset Wanderers played two further matches during their tour of France, both one-day contests, and won them both. They were not impressed by the French, whom a journalist at the time described as &quot;too excitable to enjoy the game&quot;.

Neither of the teams realised that they had competed in the Olympic Games, as the match had been advertised as part of the world&#x27;s fair. Although the IOC has never decided which events were &quot;Olympic&quot; and which were not, the medals won by the teams were later upgraded to gold for Great Britain and silver for France.

A cricket competition was scheduled for the 1904 Summer Olympics, held in St. Louis, but it was cancelled at short notice due to a lack of entries: the sport would not be included in the Olympic Games again until 2028.

As the match was 12-a-side and was scheduled for only two days, it does not have first-class status; despite this, it was the only international cricket match played that year.

<doc id="228484" wikidata="Q1062585" url="?curid=228484" title="Chaos magic">
<text>Chaos magic, also spelled chaos magick, is a modern tradition of magic. Emerging in England in the 1970s as part of the wider neo-pagan and esoteric subculture, it drew heavily from the occult beliefs of artist Austin Osman Spare, expressed several decades earlier. It has been characterised as an invented religion, with some commentators drawing similarities between the movement and Discordianism. Magical organizations within this tradition include the Illuminates of Thanateros and Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth.

The founding figures of chaos magic believed that other occult traditions had become too religious in character. They attempted to strip away the symbolic, ritualistic, theological or otherwise ornamental aspects of these occult traditions, to leave behind a set of basic techniques that they believed to be the basis of magic.

Chaos magic teaches that the essence of magic is that perceptions are conditioned by beliefs, and that the world as we perceive it can be changed by deliberately changing those beliefs. Chaos magicians subsequently treat belief as a tool, often creating their own idiosyncratic magical systems and blending such different things as &quot;practical magic, quantum physics, chaos theory, and anarchism.&quot;

Scholar Hugh Urban has described chaos magic as a union of traditional occult techniques and applied postmodernism – particularly a postmodernist skepticism concerning the existence or knowability of objective truth. Namely, according to him, chaos magic rejects the existence of absolute truth, and views all occult systems as arbitrary symbol-systems that are only effective because of the &quot;belief&quot; of the practitioner.

== History ==
=== Origins and influences (1900–1982) ===
Austin Osman Spare&#x27;s work in the early to mid 1900s is largely the source of chaos magical theory and practice. Specifically, Spare developed the use of sigils and the use of gnosis to empower them. Although Spare died before chaos magic emerged, he has been described as the &quot;grandfather of chaos magic&quot;. Working during much the same period as Spare, Aleister Crowley&#x27;s publications also provided a marginal yet early and ongoing influence, particularly for his syncretic approach to magic and his emphasis on experimentation and deconditioning. Later, concurrent with the growth of religions such as Wicca in the 1950s and 1960s, different forms of magic became more common, some of which came in &quot;explicitly disorganized, radically individualized, and often quite &#x27;chaotic&#x27; forms&quot;. In the 1960s and the decade that followed, Discordianism, the punk movement, postmodernism and the writings of Robert Anton Wilson emerged, and they were to become significant influences on the form that chaos magic would take.

During the mid-1970s chaos magic appeared as &quot;one of the first postmodern manifestations of occultism&quot;, built on the rejection of a need to adhere to a &quot;single, systematized convention&quot;, and aimed at distilling magical practices down to a result-oriented approach rather than following specific practices based on tradition. An oft quoted line from Peter Carroll is &quot;Magic will not free itself from occultism until we have strangled the last astrologer with the guts of the last spiritual master.&quot;

Peter J. Carroll and Ray Sherwin are considered to be the founders of chaos magic, although Phil Hine points out that there were others &quot;lurking in the background, such as the &quot;Stoke Newington Sorcerors&quot;&quot;. Carroll was a regular contributor to &quot;The New Equinox&quot;, a magazine edited by Sherwin, and thus the two became acquainted.

In 1976-77 the first chaos magic organization Illuminates of Thanateros (IOT) was announced. The following year, 1978, was a seminal year in the origin of chaos magic, seeing the publication of both &quot;Liber Null&quot; by Carroll and &quot;The Book of Results&quot; by Sherwin – the first published books on chaos magic.

According to Carroll, &quot;When stripped of local symbolism and terminology, all systems show a remarkable uniformity of method. This is because all systems ultimately derive from the tradition of Shamanism. It is toward an elucidation of this tradition that the following chapters are devoted.&quot;

=== Development and spread (1982–1994) ===
New chaos magic groups emerged in the early 1980s – at first, located in Yorkshire, where both Sherwin and Carroll were living. The early scene was focused on a shop in Leeds called &quot;The Sorceror&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;, owned by Chris Bray. Bray also published a magazine called &quot;The Lamp of Thoth&quot;, which published articles on chaos magic, and his &quot;Sorceror&#x27;s Apprentice Press&quot; re-released both &quot;Liber Null&quot; and &quot;The Book of Results&quot;, as well as issuing &quot;Psychonaut&quot; and &quot;The Theatre of Magic&quot;. The &quot;short-lived&quot; &quot;Circle of Chaos&quot;, which included Dave Lee, was formed in 1982. The rituals of this group were published by Paula Pagani as &quot;The Cardinal Rites of Chaos&quot; in 1985.

Ralph Tegtmeier (Frater U∴D∴), who ran a bookshop in Germany and was already practicing his own brand of &quot;ice magick&quot;, translated &quot;Liber Null&quot; into German. Tegtmeier was inducted into the IOT in the mid-1980s, and later established the German section of the order.

As chaos magic spread, people from outside Carroll and Sherwin&#x27;s circle began publishing on the topic. Phil Hine, along with Julian Wilde and Joel Biroco, published a number of books on the subject that were particularly influential in spreading chaos magic techniques via the internet.

In 1981, Genesis P-Orridge established Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth (TOPY). P-Orridge had studied magic under William S. Burroughs and Brion Gysin in the 1970s, and was also influenced by Aleister Crowley and Austin Osman Spare, as well as the psychedelic movement. TOPY practiced chaos magic alongside their other activities, and helped raise awareness of chaos magic in subcultures like the Acid house and Industrial music scenes. Along with being an influence on P-Orridge, Burroughs was himself inducted into the IOT in the early 1990s.

=== Pop culture: (1994–2000s) ===
From the beginning, chaos magic has had a tendency to draw on the symbolism of pop culture in addition to that of traditional magical systems; the rationale being that all symbol systems are equally arbitrary, and thus equally valid – the belief invested in them being the thing that matters. The symbol of chaos, for example, was lifted from the fantasy novels of Michael Moorcock.

Preluded by Kenneth Grant – who had studied with both Crowley and Spare, and who had introduced elements of H.P. Lovecraft&#x27;s fictional Cthulhu mythos into his own magical writings – there was a trend for chaos magicians to perform rituals invoking or otherwise dealing with entities from Lovecraft&#x27;s work, such as the Great Old Ones. Hine, for example, published &quot;The Pseudonomicon&quot; (1994), a book of Lovecraftian rites.

From 1994 to 2000, Grant Morrison wrote &quot;The Invisibles&quot; for DC Comics&#x27; Vertigo imprint, which has been described by Morrison as a &quot;hypersigil&quot;: &quot;a dynamic miniature model of the magician&#x27;s universe, a hologram, microcosm or &#x27;voodoo doll&#x27; which can be manipulated in real time to produce changes in the macrocosmic environment of &#x27;real&#x27; life.&quot; Both &quot;The Invisibles&quot; and the activities of Morrison themself were responsible for bringing chaos magic to a much wider audience in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with the writer outlining their views on chaos magic in the &quot;Pop Magic!&quot; chapter of &quot;A Book of Lies&quot; (2003) and a Disinfo Convention talk.

Morrison&#x27;s particular take on chaos magic exemplified the irreverent, pop cultural elements of the tradition, with Morrison arguing that the deities of different religions (Hermes, Mercury, Thoth, Ganesh, etc.) are nothing more than different cultural &quot;glosses&quot; for more universal &quot;big ideas&quot; – and are therefore interchangeable: both with each other, and with other pop culture icons like The Flash, or Metron, or Madonna.

=== Post-chaos magic: 2010s ===
Alan Chapman – whilst praising chaos magic for &quot;breathing new life&quot; into Western occultism, thereby saving it from &quot;being lost behind a wall of overly complex symbolism and antiquated morality&quot; – has also criticised chaos magic for its lack of &quot;initiatory knowledge&quot;: i.e., &quot;teachings that cannot be learned from books, but must be transmitted orally, or demonstrated&quot;, present in all traditional schools of magic. Innovations continue into the 2020s, as found in social media, fandoms, and webcomics.

== Beliefs, core concepts, and practices ==
=== Belief as a tool ===
The central defining tenet of chaos magic is arguably the idea that belief is a tool for achieving effects. In chaos magic, complex symbol systems like Qabalah, the Enochian system, astrology or the &quot;I Ching&quot; are treated as maps or &quot;symbolic and linguistic constructs&quot; that can be manipulated to achieve certain ends but that have no absolute or objective truth value in themselves. Religious scholar Hugh Urban notes that chaos magic&#x27;s &quot;rejection of all fixed models of reality&quot; reflects one of its central tenets: &quot;nothing is true everything is permitted&quot;.

Both Urban and religious scholar Bernd-Christian Otto trace this position to the influence of postmodernism on contemporary occultism. Another influence comes from Spare, who believed that belief itself was a form of &quot;psychic energy&quot; that became locked up in rigid belief structures, and that could be released by breaking down those structures. This &quot;free belief&quot; could then be directed towards new aims. Otto has argued that chaos magic &quot;filed away the whole issue of truth, thus liberating and instrumentalising individual belief as a mere tool of ritual practice.&quot;

=== Magical paradigm shifting ===
Peter J. Carroll suggested assigning different worldviews to the sides of a die, and then inhabiting a particular random paradigm for a set length of time (a week, a month, a year, etc.), depending on which number is rolled. For example, 1 might be paganism, 2 might be monotheism, 3 might be atheism, and so on.

Phil Hine has stated that the primary task here is &quot;to thoroughly decondition&quot; the aspiring magician from &quot;the mesh of beliefs, attitudes and fictions about self, society, and the world&quot; that his or her ego associates with:

Our ego is a fiction of stable self-hood which maintains itself by perpetuating the distinctions of &quot;what I am/what I am not, what I like/what I don&#x27;t like&quot;, beliefs about ones politics, religion, gender preference, degree of free will, race, subculture etc all help maintain a stable sense of self.

=== Cut-up technique ===
The cut-up technique is an aleatory literary technique in which a written text is cut up and rearranged, often at random, to create a new text. The technique can also be applied to other media: film, photography, audio recordings, etc. It was pioneered by Brion Gysin and William S. Burroughs.

Burroughs – who practiced chaos magic, and was inducted into the Illuminates of Thanateros in the early 1990s – was adamant that the technique had a magical function, stating &quot;the cut ups are not for artistic purposes&quot;. Burroughs used his cut-ups for &quot;political warfare, scientific research, personal therapy, magical divination, and conjuration&quot; – the essential idea being that the cut-ups allowed the user to &quot;break down the barriers that surround consciousness&quot;. Burroughs stated:

I would say that my most interesting experience with the earlier techniques was the realization that when you make cut-ups you do not get simply random juxtapositions of words, that they do mean something, and often that these meanings refer to some future event. I&#x27;ve made many cut-ups and then later recognized that the cut-up referred to something that I read later in a newspaper or a book, or something that happened... Perhaps events are pre-written and pre-recorded and when you cut word lines the future leaks out.

David Bowie compared the randomness of the cut-up technique to the randomness inherent in traditional divinatory systems, like the &quot;I Ching&quot; or Tarot.

Genesis P-Orridge, who studied under Burroughs described it as a way to &quot;identify and short circuit control, life being a stream of cut-ups on every level. They are a means to describe and reveal reality and the multi-faceted individual in which/from which reality is generated.&quot;

<doc id="228489" wikidata="Q612127" url="?curid=228489" title="Croquet at the 1900 Summer Olympics">
<text>At the 1900 Summer Olympics, three croquet events were contested. Seven men and three women participated. The doubles competition was scheduled first, though it is unclear whether the French pair that won had any competition. The one-ball singles was played the next week, followed by two-ball singles the week after. France, which supplied all 10 competitors, therefore won all the medals.

This was the only Olympiad where croquet was part of the official programme, though there was the variant called roque at the 1904 Summer Olympics. All events which were restricted to amateurs, open to all nations, open to all competitors, and without handicapping, are now regarded as Olympic events (except for ballooning). Although croquet satisfied three criteria, it had been thought to have an entrant from Belgium, Marcel Haëntjens, (Haëntjens is a Flemish name) and thus have been an international competition. Haëntjens is now known to have been from France, as were the other croquet players. Only one paying spectator attended the event.

<text>The 1900 Summer Olympics were held as part of the 1900 World&#x27;s Fair, during which many cycling events were contested. The IOC website currently affirms a total of 3 medal events, after accepting, as it appears, the recommendation of Olympic historian Bill Mallon regarding events that should be considered &quot;Olympic&quot;. These additional events include the men&#x27;s points race. Thus, three cycling events are considered Olympic events. These three competitions were held between 9 September and 16 September 1900. The cycling part of the World&#x27;s Fair included 250 competitors, 160 of them French. In the sprint and 25 km events, 72 competitors, all men, from seven nations competed.

==Medal summary==

==Daily summary==

===11 September===
* In the first two rounds of the 2000 metre sprint, the United States and Italy made their cycling debuts, as did the Olympic-debut nations Belgium and Bohemia. Germany, which had won a silver medal four years earlier, and France, with 4 golds, a silver, and a bronze, were the returning nations.
* Bohemia&#x27;s lone cyclist was eliminated in the first round. The Belgian cyclist was eliminated in the second round of the day, the quarterfinals. Germany&#x27;s trio fared no better, with all having dropped out by the end of the day. Antonio Restelli was the only one of Italy&#x27;s 7 to move on. He was joined by the sole American John Henry Lake and by 7 Frenchmen.

===13 September===
* The semifinals and the final of the sprint were held on the 13th.
* The semifinal round pared the 9 remaining cyclists down to 3, with the winners of each of the semifinals guaranteed a medal in the three-man final. Restelli took second place to Fernand Sanz, dropping Italy from contention. Lake won his semifinal, joining Sanz and Georges Taillandier in the final.
* Taillandier and Sanz reaffirmed French dominance of the sport, taking the top two spots in the final. Lake took the United States&#x27; first medal in cycling.

===15 September===
* The 25 kilometres was held on the 15th. Frenchman Louis Bastien, Briton Louis Hildebrand, and American Lake were the primary contenders, with Bastien the favorite. Lake was unable to keep pace with Hildebrand, however, and dropped out of the race. Bastien won, followed by Hildebrand and Auguste Daumain. Future Tour de France winner Louis Trousselier was among the rest of the pack.
* The amateur points race, or &quot;Course de Primes&quot;, was also held on 15 September. It was a 5 kilometre race — 10 laps of the track — with points awarded at the end of each lap.

==Participating nations==
A total of 72 cyclists from 7 nations competed at the sprint and 25 km cycling events during the Paris Games:

==Non-Olympic events==
In 1900, there was no official distinction between Olympic events and non-Olympic events held during the Exposition Universelle (1900). Most events were open for all cyclists. The cycling events satisfying all of these criteria—restricted to amateurs, open to all nations, open to all competitors and without handicapping—are now regarded as Olympic events. Before July 2021 the IOC has never decided which events were &quot;Olympic&quot; and which were not. Other events were:
*50 kilometres
*Tandems
*Inter-rêgionale
*100 miles (winner: Taylor, France)
*Grand Prix de l’Exposition - Sprint for professionals (winner: Harie Meyers, The Netherlands)
*100 kilometers (winner: Arthur Adalbert Chase, England)
*Grand Course des Nations (winner: American team)
*Handicap
*Amateurs handicap
*Professional points race
*Individual pursuit
*Bol d&#x27;Or (Winner: Mathieu Cordang, Netherlands)

<text>The Jubilee ( &quot;yōḇel;&quot; Yiddish: &quot;yoyvl&quot;) is the year that follows the passage of seven &quot;weeks of years&quot; (seven cycles of sabbatical years, or 49 total years). This fiftieth year deals largely with land, property, and property rights. According to regulations found in the Book of Leviticus, certain indentured servants would be released from servitude, some debts would be forgiven, and everyone was supposed to return to their own property in jubilee years.

Rabbinic literature mentions a dispute between the Sages and Rabbi Yehuda over whether it was the 49th year (the last year of seven sabbatical cycles, referred to as the Sabbath&#x27;s Sabbath), or whether it was the following (50th) year.

The biblical rules concerning sabbatical years are still observed by many religious Jews in Israel, but the practices prescribed for the Jubilee year have not been observed for many centuries. According to current interpretation of Torah in contemporary Rabbinic Judaism, the observance of the Jubilee year only applied when the Jewish people were living in the Land of Israel according to their tribes. Therefore, in one sense Jubilee has not been applicable since the destruction of the Kingdom of Israel in 722 BCE by Neo-Assyrian king Sargon II. 

In modern Israel, the Jubilee rules concerning land redistribution have been rendered functionally obsolete by secular Israeli land law. The vast majority of land in Israel is owned by the Israel Land Authority (until 2009, the Israel Land Administration), an agency of the Ministry of Construction and Housing, and the private non-profit Jewish National Fund.

==Etymology==
The Septuagint used the phrase &quot;a trumpet-blast of liberty&quot; (ἀφέσεως σημασία &quot;apheseôs sêmasia&quot;), and the Vulgate used the Latin &quot;iobeleus&quot;; the English term &quot;Jubilee&quot; derives from the Latin term. The Latin term derives from the Hebrew term יוֹבֵל &quot;yōḇēl&quot;, used in the Masoretic Text, which also meant &quot;ram&quot; and &quot;ram&#x27;s horn trumpet&quot;; the Jubilee year was announced by a blast on a shofar, an instrument made from a ram&#x27;s horn, during that year&#x27;s Yom Kippur.

==Origin and purpose==

 states:
Ancient Near Eastern societies regularly declared noncommercial debts void, typically at the coronation of a new king or at the king’s order. Biblical scholars once argued that the Jubilee was an obvious development of the Sabbatical year. Rather than waiting for the 50th or 49th year, the Deuteronomic Code requires that Hebrew slaves be liberated during their 7th year of service, as does the Covenant Code, which some textual scholars regard as pre-dating the Holiness code; the Book of Ezekiel, which some textual scholars also regard as earlier than the Holiness Code, refers to a &quot;year of liberty&quot; (שנת דרור), during which property is returned to the original owner (or their heirs), (earlier written mentioning in Sum: ama-gi, ama-ar-gi, &#x27;return to the mother&#x27;) but the word דרור is used by Jeremiah to describe the release of slaves during the Sabbatical year, which various scholars take to imply that Ezekiel must have been referring to the sabbatical year. Scholars suspect that the transfer of these regulations to 49th or 50th year was a deliberate attempt to parallel the fact that Shavuot is 50 days after Passover, and follows seven weeks of harvest; this parallel is regarded as significant in Kabbalah.

According to the documentary hypothesis, originally proposed by Julius Wellhausen, the Biblical chapters that contain the Jubilee and Sabbatical-year legislation (chapters 25 and 27 of Leviticus) were part of the so-called &quot;P&quot; or Priestly Code that Wellhausen believed represented the last stage in the development of Israel&#x27;s religion. Wellhausen dated those chapters to a late exilic or post-exilic period though many modern proponents of the Documentary Hypothesis have arrived at different datings.

Wellhausen&#x27;s theory that the Jubilee and Sabbatical-year legislation was written in the exilic or post-exilic period, specifically after the time of Ezekiel, has always been challenged by scholars who have maintained the traditional position of Judaism and Christianity for the Mosaic authorship of Leviticus. Recently, however, the theories of Wellhausen and others who date the Jubilee and Sabbatical-year legislation to the exilic period or later have also been challenged by scholars who generally do not have a conservative view of the Bible. Yehezekel Kaufmann has argued that the book of Ezekiel quotes from the Sabbatical and Jubilee legislation of the Book of Leviticus, which must have been in existence before Ezekiel&#x27;s writings. This argument has been expanded by Risa Levitt Kohn. Kohn examined in detail the 97 terms and phrases that are shared between Ezekiel and the Priestly Code. She concludes:
John Bergsma provides a further argument against an exilic or post-exilic date for the codifying of the Jubilee and Sabbatical-year legislation, saying that the &quot;Sitz im Leben&quot; (life situation) of the exilic or post-exilic period is not at all addressed by this legislation.
Bergsma therefore points out the incongruity of Wellhausen&#x27;s ascribing an exilic or post-exilic date to the Jubilee and Sabbatical-year legislation, since this would conflict with the &quot;Sitz im Leben&quot; of Israel during, and after, the exile. In addition, Bergsma shows that the problem that this legislation was addressing was a problem recognized by the kings of Babylon in the second millennium BC, which naturally suggests the possibility of a much earlier date of codification. These Babylonian kings (to whom could be added Ammi-Saduqa) occasionally issued decrees for the cancellation of debts and/or the return of the people to the lands they had sold. Such &quot;clean slate&quot; decrees were intended to redress the tendency of debtors, in ancient societies, to become hopelessly in debt to their creditors, thus accumulating most of the arable land into the control of a wealthy few. The decrees were issued sporadically.

Economist Michael Hudson maintains that the Biblical legislation of the Jubilee and Sabbatical years addressed the same problems encountered by these Babylonian kings, but the Biblical formulation of the laws presented a significant advance in justice and the rights of the people. This was due to the &quot;clean slates&quot; now being codified into law, rather than relying on the whim of the king. Furthermore, the regular rhythm of the Sabbatical and Jubilee years meant that everyone would know when the next release was due, thereby giving fairness and equity to both creditor and debtor. Hudson therefore maintains that not only was the Levitical legislation a significant advance over the prior attempts to deal with indebtedness, but this legislation was also eminently practical, in contradiction to many Biblical interpreters who are not economists and who have labeled it &quot;utopian&quot;.

==Regulations==
The biblical regulations concerning the Jubilee year appear in . According to these regulations, the Jubilee was to be sounded once 49 years had been counted, raising an ambiguity over whether the Jubilee was within the 49th year, or followed it as an intercalation in the 7-year sabbatical cycles; scholars and classical rabbinical sources are divided on the question.

The biblical requirement is that the Jubilee year was to be treated like a Sabbatical year, with the land lying fallow, but also required the compulsory return of all property to its original owners or their heirs, except the houses of laymen within walled cities, in addition to the manumission of all Israelite indentured servants.

The biblical regulations state that the land was to rest a &quot;Sabbath&quot; when the Children of Israel came to the land God was giving them Israel. The Seder Olam Rabbah (second century AD), stated that this verse meant that the counting was not to start until after the Israelites had gained control of Canaan, which the Seder Olam, based upon received tradition, placed at 14 years after their entry into the land. This interpretation has been largely adopted in later rabbinic scholarship. One reason for this interpretation of the Levitical text was that if counting started before the land was completely conquered, it would require the Israelites to return the land to the Canaanites within 50 years; similar nationalistic concerns about the impact of the Jubilee on land ownership have been raised by Zionist settlers. From a legal point of view, the Jubilee law effectively banned sale of land as fee simple, and instead land could only be leased for no more than 50 years. The biblical regulations go on to specify that the price of land had to be proportional to how many years remained before the Jubilee, with land being cheaper the closer it is to the Jubilee.

==Length of the cycle==
Since the 49th year was already a sabbatical year, the land was required to be left fallow during it, but if the 50th year also had to be kept fallow, as the Jubilee, then no new crops would be available for two years, and only the summer fruits would be available for the following year, creating a much greater risk of starvation overall; Judah the Prince contended that the jubilee year was identical with the sabbatical 49th year. However, the majority of classical rabbis believed that the biblical phrase &quot;hallow the fiftieth year&quot;, together with the biblical promise that there would be three years worth of fruit in the &quot;sixth year&quot;, implies that the jubilee year was the 50th year. The opinion of the Geonim, and generally of later authorities, was that prior to the Babylonian captivity the Jubilee was the intercalation of the 50th year, but after the captivity ended the Jubilee was essentially ignored, except for the blast of the shofar, and coincided with the sabbatical 49th year; the reason was that the Jubilee was only to be observed when the Jews controlled all of Canaan, including the territories of Reuben and Gad and the eastern half-tribe of Manasseh.

The length of the Jubilee cycle continues to be of interest to modern scholarship, as does the question of the practicality of the legislation, and whether it was ever put into effect on a nationwide basis. Regarding the length of the cycle, three significant scholarly studies devoted to the Jubilee and Sabbatical years agree that it was 49 years, while disagreeing somewhat on the interpretation of the other issues involved. These major studies were those of Benedict Zuckermann, Robert North, and Jean-François Lefebvre. The reasons given by these authors to support a 49-year cycle are both textual (examining all relevant Biblical texts) and practical.

Calendrical document 4Q319 from the Dead Sea Scrolls &quot;represents a calendrical system based on the weekly rotation of the twenty-four priestly courses during a six-year period and constructed into six consecutive Jubilees, i.e. 294 years.&quot;.

===Textual and practical considerations===
An example of the textual argument is given by North in his comparison of with . The first passage establishes the timing, in days, for the Festival of Weeks (&quot;Shavuot&quot;), while the second prescribes the timing, in years, for the Jubilee. In the first passage, the start of counting for the Festival of Weeks is said to be &quot;the day after the Sabbath&quot; (&quot;mimaharat ha-shabat&quot;, ), and is to end &quot;the day after the seventh Sabbath&quot; (&quot;mimaharat ha-shabat ha-sheviyit&quot;, ). These seven weeks would constitute 49 days in most modern methods of reckoning. Nevertheless, verse 16 says that they are to be reckoned as 50 days. This method of reckoning (sometimes called &quot;inclusive numbering&quot;) is fairly common in Scripture; for example, the Feast of Tabernacles is to last for seven days (), but the last day is called the eighth day (v. 36). North found this comparison between Leviticus 23 (Feast of Weeks) and Leviticus 25 (Jubilees) to be &quot;the strongest possible support for the &quot;forty-ninth&quot; year&quot; as the Jubilee year. His conclusion that the Jubilee was identical with the seventh Sabbatical year was followed by Lefebvre, for this as well as additional reasons.

The consideration that the Jubilee was identical with the seventh Sabbatical year solves the various practical problems, as also addressed by these authors. If the Jubilee were separate from, and following the seventh Sabbatical year, then there would be two fallow years in succession. Lefebvre points out, however, that there is no support in Scripture for two voluntary fallow years in succession, even though some have misinterpreted as if this refers to a Jubilee year following a Sabbatical year, which is not the sense of the passage. Lefebvre shows that this cannot be the case because planting is mentioned for the eighth year; it is the year after a Sabbath, a year in which planting and harvesting resume. Another practical problem that would occur if the Jubilee cycle were 50 years is that, after the first cycle, the Jubilee and Sabbatical cycles would be out of phase unless the seventh Sabbatical cycle was stretched to eight years. But Scripture gives no instructions for making such an adjustment. Instead, it is assumed that the two cycles will always be in phase so that the &quot;shofar&quot; can be sounded in the seventh year of the seventh Sabbatical cycle.

In contrast, the consideration that the Jubilee year is an intercalated year separate and distinct from the Sabbatical cycles resolves an issue of the requirement for observation of the Torah of both and . For in the former passage, the command is that sowing and pruning must occur for six consecutive years, whereas in the latter, the command is to neither sow, nor reap nor gather from untended vines in the Jubilee year. If the Jubilee year is the 50th year as confirmed by , it must necessarily be a separate year from the first 49 years comprising the whole of the first seven Sabbatical cycles. Therefore it cannot be identical with the seventh Sabbatical year, as 49 does not equal 50. Were the Jubilee year to be considered identical with year one of the following Sabbatical cycle, the requirement of observing six consecutive years of sowing and pruning could not be observed as only five years would therefore be available for sowing and reaping, not the specified six as requires. A lot of the misunderstanding comes from not carefully reading the original Hebrew text. There was no requirement in the Law to observe 6 consecutive years of sowing. The command stated that you may sow for six years but in the seventh year the land must observe a sabbath rest. It would be a double negative to command the land to be sowed for six years in cases of famine and war.

===Historical considerations===
Although not cited by these authors, two historical arguments also argue for a 49-year cycle. The first is that the Samaritans celebrated a 49-year cycle. Although the Samaritans stopped counting for the Jubilee some hundreds of years ago, according to a recent report an effort is underway to determine the date when counting ceased in order to resume. The counting will again be according to a 49-year cycle. A second historical argument has been presented to the effect that the two instances of a Jubilee mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud (tractates &quot;Arakin&quot; 12a and &quot;Megillah&quot; 14b) appear to be proper historical remembrances, because the known calculation methods of rabbinic scholarship were incapable of correctly calculating the dates of the Jubilees mentioned. Rabbinic (Talmudic) scholarship always assumed non-accession reckoning for kings, whereby the first partial year of a king was double-counted both for him and as the last year of the deceased king. This reckoning would give 47 years from the Jubilee mentioned in the 18th year of Josiah (&quot;Megillah&quot; 14b) to the Jubilee that took place 14 years after Jerusalem fell to the Babylonians (&quot;Arakin&quot; 12a), whereas the correct difference was 49 years (623 BC to 574 BC). This has been presented as additional evidence that the cycle was 49 years, and further that the cycles were being measured until the last Jubilee in the days of Ezekiel, when the stipulations of the Jubilee year, long neglected except in the counting of the priests, could no longer be observed because the people were captive in a foreign land.

==Date when counting began==
The &quot;Seder Olam Rabbah&quot; recognized the importance of the Jubilee and Sabbatical cycles as a long-term calendrical system, and attempted at various places to fit the Sabbatical and Jubilee years into its chronological scheme. As mentioned above, the &quot;Seder Olam&quot; put forth the idea that the counting for these cycles was deferred until 14 years after entry into the land. The reasons for this are given in &quot;Seder Olam&quot; chapter 11. In Joshua chapter 14, Caleb mentions that he was 40 years old when he was sent out as a spy in the second year of the 40-year wilderness journey, and his present age was 85, which meant he received his inheritance seven years after entering Canaan. Rabbi Jose assumed that everyone else received their inheritance when Caleb did, or had already received it, so that the allotment of the land to the tribes was finished at this time. Because the division of the land took seven years, the conquest that followed must also have taken seven years. &quot;One has to say that 14 years Israel spent at Gilgal, seven when they were conquering and seven when they were distributing.&quot; Then, after putting up the Tabernacle at Shiloh, &quot;At that moment, they started to count years for tithes, Sabbatical years, and Jubilee years.&quot;

Another explanation has been offered for Rabbi Jose&#x27;s postponement of counting until 14 years had elapsed. In this same chapter 11 of the &quot;Seder Olam&quot;, Rabbi Jose stated (for unknown reasons) that Israel&#x27;s time in its land must have lasted an integral number of Jubilee periods. If this were true, one of those periods should have ended at the beginning of the exile in 587 BC. Yet Rabbi Jose also believed that Ezekiel 40:1 marked the beginning of the seventeenth Jubilee, and this was 14 years after the city fell. In other words, the Jubilee came 14 years too late, according to the idea that the time in the land must comprise an integral number of Jubilee cycles. Rodger Young proposes that the knowledge of when a genuine Jubilee was due was the real reason for the supposition of a delay before the start of counting:

The reason for the fourteen-year delay in &quot;Seder ‘Olam&quot; 11 is that Rabbi Yose (primary author of the &quot;Seder ‘Olam&quot;) had the &quot;idée fixe&quot; that the total time that Israel spent in its land must come out to an exact number of Jubilee cycles. If that had been the case, then we should have expected that 587 BC, when the exile began, would have been at the end of a Jubilee period. However, Rabbi Yose cited Ezek 40:1 as designating the time of the seventeenth Jubilee, and since he knew this was fourteen years after the city fell, he presumed that counting had been delayed for fourteen years so that he could account for the fourteen years between the fall of the city and the observance of the seventeenth Jubilee. He also mentioned the previous Jubilee, in the time of Josiah. As much as he would have liked to put these last two Jubilees fourteen years earlier in order to be consistent with his &quot;idée fixe&quot;, Rabbi Yose could not do it because he knew these were historical dates, not dates that came from his own calculation. 

An alternative account is that counting started at the entry into the land. This follows from a straightforward reading of the relevant text in Leviticus:
The then spoke to Moses at Mount Sinai, saying, &quot;Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, &#x27;When you come into the land which I shall give you, then the land shall have a sabbath to the . Six years you shall sow your field, and six years you shall prune your vineyard and gather in its crop, but during the seventh year the land shall have a sabbath rest, a sabbath to the ... You are also to count off seven sabbaths of years for yourself, seven times seven years, so that you have the time of the seven sabbaths of years, &quot;namely&quot;, forty-nine years. You shall then sound a ram&#x27;s horn abroad on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the day of atonement you shall sound a horn all through your land. You shall thus consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim a release through the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you (Leviticus 25:1–4, 8–10, NASB).

The Talmud states that the people of Israel counted 17 Jubilees from the time they entered the Land of Canaan until their exile at the destruction of the First Temple. If counting is measured back 17 cycles from Ezekiel&#x27;s Jubilee that began in Tishri of 574 BC, based on Thiele&#x27;s computation, the first year of the first cycle would have been 1406 BC. According to the religious calendar that started the year in Nisan, and in accordance with Joshua 5:10 that places the entry in the land in Nisan, Nisan of 1406 BC is the month and year when counting started. But 1406 BC is the year of entry into the land that is traditionally derived by another method, namely taking Thiele&#x27;s date of 931/930 BC for the start of the divided kingdom after Solomon&#x27;s death, in conjunction with 1 Kings 6:1 (Solomon&#x27;s fourth year was 480th year of Exodus-era), to derive the date of the Exodus in 1446 BC. The method of determining the date of the Exodus and entry into Canaan from the Jubilee cycles is independent of the method of deriving these dates from 1 Kings 6:1, yet the two methods agree.

A different approach is taken in the Talmud (&quot;Arakhin&quot; 12a–b) which, like &quot;Seder Olam&quot;, assigns only 410 years to the First Temple, preceded by 480 years from the exodus to its building by Solomon () in 832 BC (by the rabbinic accounting) and its destruction in 422 BC. The Talmud (&quot;Arakhin&quot; 12b) accounts for 40 years of wandering in the wilderness, and 7 years taken to conquer the land of Canaan and 7 years to divide the land among the tribes, putting the first Jubilee cycle precisely 54 years after the exodus (i.e. in 1258 BC), and saying that the people of Israel counted 17 Jubilees from the time they entered the Land of Canaan until their departure, and that the last Jubilee occurred 14 years after the First Temple&#x27;s destruction (i.e. in 408 BC). Talmudic exegete, Rashi, explains in the Talmud (&quot;Arakhin&quot; 12b) that the year of the First Temple&#x27;s destruction (422 BC) was actually the 36th year in the Jubilee cycle, and that fourteen years later (408 BC) would have been the next Jubilee. This time span, taken together (from 1258 BC to 408 BC), accrues to 850 years, during which time the people counted seventeen Jubilees.

The historian Josephus, however, had a different tradition, writing in his work &quot;Antiquities&quot; (10.8.5) that the First Temple stood 470 years, which would, of necessity, offset the number of Jubilee cycles. Moreover, Josephus&#x27; reckoning of the timeline of events does not always align with &quot;Seder Olam&quot;, the book on which rabbinic tradition is so dependent. The discrepancies between Josephus and &quot;Seder Olam&quot; have led some scholars to think that the dates prescribed in &quot;Seder Olam&quot; are only approximations, as Josephus brings down supportive evidence by making use of two basic epochs, the Olympiad era counting and the Seleucid era counting, drawn principally from other writers, to verify the historicity of many of these events. In spite of their differences in the general span of years, there is not necessarily disagreement between Josephus and &quot;Seder Olam&quot; when Josephus refers to dates of Sabbatical years during the Second Temple period, as the time-frame for these dates overlap those mentioned in &quot;Seder Olam&quot; (chapter 30) for the Grecian, Hasmonean, and Herodian periods.

==Theological significance==
The text of the Book of Leviticus argues that the Jubilee existed because the land was the possession of Yahweh, and its current occupiers were merely aliens or tenants, and therefore the land should not be sold forever. Midrashic sources argue that the Jubilee was created to preserve the original division of land between the Israelite tribes, as evidenced by the rabbinical tradition that the Jubilee should not be imposed until the Israelites were in control of Canaan. Leviticus also states that the Israelites were the servants of Yahweh, which classical rabbis took as justification for the manumission of Israelite slaves at the Jubilee, using the argument that no man should have two masters, and thus, as the servants of Yahweh, the Israelites should not also be the servants of men.

A further theological insight afforded by the Jubilee cycles is explained in Andrew Steinmann&#x27;s monograph on Biblical chronology. Steinmann has an extended discussion of the evidence for various pre-exilic Sabbatical years, and how they all occurred an integral number of seven-year periods before Ezekiel’s Jubilee (see the Historical Sabbatical Years article). He also notes that the date of the entry into the land implied by Ezekiel&#x27;s Jubilee (the seventeenth) is in exact agreement with the date calculated from 1 Kings 6:1 and Joshua 5:6. These chronological considerations are usually neglected in discussions of the legislation for the Jubilee and Sabbatical years, but Steinmann stresses their theological importance as follows:
==Policy implications==
Despite the fact that the specific norms of the Jubilee were meant for an agrarian and ancient economy, it has been noted that its principles of economic justice remain relevant and can be adapted to the modern world. The periodic land redistribution mandated by the Jubilee was aimed at preventing excessive wealth inequality and democratizing private property, without abrogating either personal responsibility or incentives for prosperity. The Jubilee provides an economic structure that regularly dissolves large economic inequalities. Given that every fifty years almost every citizen in Ancient Israel was entitled to a plot of land — the main form of wealth at the time — the system seems to promote a form of Asset-based egalitarianism, embracing a universal basic capital or universal inheritance, which in turn could justify a Universal basic income. The norm of Leviticus 25:13, according to which everyone was supposed to return to their own property in the Jubilee years, coupled with the fact that land was initially equally distributed among the Israelites (Book of Numbers 26:51-54), provides additional grounding for Thomas Paine&#x27;s idea of natural inheritance.

<text>Pandit Hridaynath Mangeshkar (Marathi pronunciation: ; born 26 October 1937) is an Indian music director &amp; occasional singer. He is the only son of musician Deenanath Mangeshkar and younger brother of Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhosle. He is popularly known as &quot;Balasaheb&quot; in the music and film industry. He Received Filmfare Marathi Lifetime Achievement Award For His Contribution in Marathi Cinema.

==Career==

Hridaynath debuted his music career in 1955 with the Marathi film &quot;Akash Ganga&quot;. Since then, he has composed for various Marathi films such as &quot;Sansar, Chaani, Ha Khel Savalyancha, Janaki, Jait Re Jait, Umbartha&quot; and &quot;Nivdung&quot; and a few Bollywood films; the most notable among them being &quot;Subah&quot;, &quot;Lekin...&quot; and &quot;Maya Memsaab&quot;.

He has been very selective with his work. He has composed songs in Marathi and Hindi. His songs often have complex meters and require singers of great range and depth for enjoyable renditions. His composition of Vinayak Damodar Savarkar&#x27;s poem &quot;Saagara Pran Talamalala&quot; is a case in point. His 1982 album &quot;Dnyaneshwar Mauli&quot;, featuring compositions from Jñāneśvar, one of the most famous poets in Marathi literature, set the standard for modern devotional music in Marathi.

He also composed music for Doordarshan musical drama &quot;Phoolwanti&quot;.

He has also composed folk songs. Staying true to the spirit, his &quot;Koli Geets&quot; (fishermen songs) reflect the traditional rhythms of the fishermen of Konkan. His music to the critically acclaimed movie &quot;Jait Re Jait&quot; is another example of his prowess in this genre. One of his most popular works is the composition for the Marathi film &quot;Nivdung&quot;. 

At one point, Hridaynath was a student of Ustad Amir Khan; however, he feels that his guru is not as timeless as his sister Lata.

He has been the recipient of several awards throughout his career, such as the prestigious National Award at the hands of the President of India, the Lata Mangeshkar Award of Maharashtra state, and seven Maharashtra State Awards for Best Vocalist and Music Director/Composer.

He was awarded the title pandit by the people of Maharashtra at the hands of Bhimsen Joshi and Jasraj. The Shankaracharya has conferred upon him the title &quot;Bhaav Gandharva&quot;.

He was awarded Padma Shri by the Government of India in 2009.

Some of his most memorable Hindi film scores are &quot;Harishchandra Taramati&quot;, &quot;Prarthana&quot;, &quot;Chakra&quot;, &quot;Lekin...&quot;, &quot;Maya Memsaab&quot;, &quot;Lal Salaam&quot;, Yash Chopra&#x27;s &quot;Mashaal&quot;, &quot;Dhanwan&quot; and &quot;Chaani&quot;, to name a few.

He is also the first Indian composer to compose and release two entire albums featuring the poems and songs of the poet-saint Meera, titled &quot;Chala Vahi Des&quot; and &quot;Meera Bhajans&quot;. He has recently also composed and released an album titled &quot;Meera Soor Kabeera&quot;, featuring the works of Meera, Kabir and Surdas. He produced an album featuring the ghazals of Ghalib, titled &quot;Ghalib&quot; and sung by Lata Mangeshkar. His collaborations with noted Marathi poets such as Shanta Shelke and Suresh Bhat have produced many Marathi classic songs of unmatched popularity.

He joined the political party Shiv Sena in 2009.

<doc id="228494" wikidata="Q280769" url="?curid=228494" title="Equestrian events at the 1900 Summer Olympics">
<text>Five equestrian competitions were held from 29 May to 2 June 1900 at the Concours Hippique International (English: International Horse Show) in Paris as part of the Exposition Universelle. The events were later classified as part of the 1900 Summer Olympics. The events were organised by the , with competitors from eight countries competing in three jumping and two driving events at the Place de Breteuil in the 7th arrondissement of Paris.

Only the three jumping events had been considered &quot;Olympic&quot; by the International Olympic Committee in the past. The IOC website currently has affirmed a total of 95 medal events, after accepting, as it appears, the recommendation of Olympic historian Bill Mallon for events that should be considered &quot;Olympic&quot;. These additional events include two equestrian driving events. It is not certain how many competitors there were, but it is likely that there were between 37 and 64. Five nations competed in the Olympic jumping events, with three more (Germany, Spain, and Austria) in the two driving events. There were three female riders, all of whom competed in the hacks and hunter combined event: Italian Elvira Guerra and Frenchwomen Jane Moulin and Blanche de Marcigny.

<text>Lies () is a South Korean erotic drama film adapted from the banned novel &quot;Tell me a Lie&quot; by Jang Jung-il, which depicts a sadomasochistic sexual relationship between a 38-year-old sculptor and an 18-year-old highschool student. The film was shot in a semi-cinéma vérité style and features interviews with the author and cast spliced in between scenes. Intended to provoke, the film contains full-frontal nudity, unsimulated sex, coprophilia, and criticisms of South Korean society. It was heavily censored upon its initial release in South Korea, but international releases were left uncut.

== Synopsis ==
Y is an 18-year-old highschool senior whose friend Woori has struck up a correspondence with J, a 38-year-old sculptor. After talking to him on the phone, she is aroused by the sound of his voice and arranges to meet him at a love hotel so she can have her first sexual encounter on her own terms instead of losing her virginity to rape like her two sisters did. The two have sex as soon as they enter the motel and proceed to have anal and oral sex. In their next tryst, he confides in her his interest in sadomasochism and she allows him to beat her on her buttocks before they have sex again.

As time goes on, they engage in regular trysts where he beats her with increasing intensity, using a wide variety of implements. At first, Y only goes along with it to make J happy, telling Woori that she desires whatever he does, but she eventually takes a liking to being beaten. When J visits his wife in Paris, his relationship with his wife deteriorates when he begs her to beat him; she refuses and the film reveals that his sexual desires have been a strain on their marriage for years.

After an unusually intense beating, Y becomes angry and J offers to let her beat him. She assumes the dominant role in the relationship and they ultimately take turns beating each other. Y&#x27;s brother discovers the affair and sets fire to J&#x27;s house. Y cuts her hair and drops out of university and J leaves home and they spend the remainder of their relationship living in hotels, having sex every night, carving tattoos onto their inner thighs, forgoing work and rejecting society. When Y&#x27;s brother dies in a motorcycle accident and when J runs out of money, Y leaves J in spite of his pleas for her not to. J ultimately moves to Paris to live with his wife.

Years later, J receives a phone call from Y, who is stopping over in Paris on her way to South America to live with her sister. They meet one last in a hotel and she changes into her old school uniform and beats him with the handle of a pickaxe, fulfilling a fantasy he once expressed to her. After the encounter, they never see each other again. When J asks him where he got the tattoo, he lies.

== Production ==
Though the onscreen sex stops just this side of hard-core, it&#x27;s fairly evident that intercourse, among other things, is actually taking place in some scenes. Production notes assert that Lee fell in love with his co-star during filming but that this was not reciprocated.

<text>The $5.98 E.P. – Garage Days Re-Revisited (released on CD as The $9.98 CD – Garage Days Re-Revisited) is the first extended play by American heavy metal band Metallica, released on August 21, 1987, by Elektra Records. It consists of covers of late-&#x27;70s and early-&#x27;80s new wave of British heavy metal bands and punk rock music rehearsed in Lars Ulrich&#x27;s soundproofed garage and then recorded in Los Angeles over the course of six days. It is the group&#x27;s first release following the death of bassist Cliff Burton and the first to feature his successor, Jason Newsted.

==Development==
With Metallica scheduled to play the 1987 Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington, the band&#x27;s UK label Vertigo Records suggested that they release new material to mark the occasion. Initial songwriting attempts with new bassist Jason Newsted resulted only in a demo for &quot;Blackened&quot;, and vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield subsequently broke his arm skateboarding and was unable to play guitar for several weeks. Given these obstacles, the band decided to record covers of some of their favorite songs rather than work on new material. Newsted utilized his earlier experience as a construction worker to soundproof Lars Ulrich&#x27;s garage in El Cerrito, California, where the band would rehearse the material prior to recording.

While rehearsing the song &quot;White Lightning&quot; by new wave of British heavy metal band Paralex, Kirk Hammett started playing &quot;The Wait&quot; by post-punk group Killing Joke, and the band subsequently decided to try recording the song. Other tracks considered but dropped include &quot;Signal Fire&quot; by Japanese band Bow Wow and another NWOBHM song, Gaskin&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m No Fool&quot;. Though &quot;Last Caress&quot; and &quot;Green Hell&quot; are combined into a single track by Metallica, the original Misfits versions were featured on different albums and were recorded five years apart. The outro of the EP features a wildly off-key segment of the Iron Maiden song &quot;Run to the Hills.&quot; The speculation surrounding this unexpected and unpleasant ending was a view into the simmering feud in the mid-1980&#x27;s between the British heavy metal legends and the America newcomers. 

The band included &quot;The $5.98 E.P.&quot; in the title in an effort to ensure that retailers did not overcharge fans. The original cassette release included a sticker stating &quot;If they try to charge more, STEAL IT!&quot; The title of the official American CD release was amended to &quot;The $9.98 CD&quot;, as the retail price of CDs was much higher than cassette; other countries (such as Australia) still displayed &quot;The $5.98 E.P.&quot; with a sticker stating that this is the &quot;title&quot; and not the price. &quot;The Wait&quot; was omitted from the UK pressings in order to conform to local music-industry rules regarding the length of EPs. 

&quot;The $5.98 E.P. – Garage Days Re-Revisited&quot; was out of print from 1989 to 2018, and the original release is considered a collector&#x27;s item. All five tracks were included on the 1998 double album &quot;Garage Inc.&quot; along with other covers and new recordings. The cover of the CD also was used as a basis for the &quot;Garage Inc.&quot; back cover, which shows the original &quot;Garage Days&quot; cover with pictures of the band members&#x27; faces, , taped over the original faces, along with &quot;Garage Inc.&quot; covering the original album name.

In 2018, &quot;The $5.98 E.P. – Garage Days Re-Revisited&quot; was reissued under Metallica&#x27;s own Blackened Recordings label and also was made available in vinyl format.

<doc id="228498" wikidata="Q732477" url="?curid=228498" title="Common brushtail possum">
<text>The common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula, from the Greek for &quot;furry tailed&quot; and the Latin for &quot;little fox&quot;, previously in the genus &quot;Phalangista&quot;) is a nocturnal, semiarboreal marsupial of the family Phalangeridae, native to Australia and invasive in New Zealand, and the second-largest of the possums.

Like most possums, the common brushtail possum is nocturnal. It is mainly a folivore, but has been known to eat small mammals such as rats. In most Australian habitats, eucalyptus leaves are a significant part of the diet, but rarely the sole item eaten. Its tail is prehensile and naked on its lower underside. The four colour variations are silver-grey, brown, black, and gold.

It is the Australian marsupial most often seen by city dwellers, as it is one of few that thrive in cities and a wide range of natural and human-modified environments. Around human habitations, common brushtails are inventive and determined foragers with a liking for fruit trees, vegetable gardens, and kitchen raids. Its once vast distribution has been greatly affected by drought, epizootic disease and intrusion of invasive mammals into its habitat.

The common brushtail possum was introduced to New Zealand in the 1850s to establish a fur industry, but in the mild subtropical climate of New Zealand, and with few to no natural predators, it thrived to the extent that it became a major agricultural and conservation pest.

==Description==
The common brushtail possum has large and pointed ears. Its bushy tail (hence its name) is adapted to grasping branches, prehensile at the end with a hairless ventral patch. Its fore feet have sharp claws and the first toe of each hind foot is clawless, but has a strong grasp. The possum grooms itself with the third and fourth toes which are fused together. It has a thick and woolly pelage that varies in colour depending on the subspecies. Colour patterns tend to be silver-grey, brown, black, red, or cream. The ventral areas are typically lighter and the tail is usually brown or black. The muzzle is marked with dark patches.

The common brushtail possum has a head and body length of with a tail length of . It weighs . Males are generally larger than females. In addition, the coat of the male tends to be reddish at the shoulders. As with most marsupials, the female brushtail possum has a forward-opening, well-developed pouch. The chest of both sexes has a scent gland that emits a reddish secretion which stains that fur around it. It marks its territory with these secretions.

==Biology and ecology==

===Range and habitat===
The common brushtail possum is perhaps the most widespread marsupial of Australia. It is found throughout the eastern and northern parts of the continent, as well as some western regions, Tasmania and a number of offshore islands, such as Kangaroo Island and Barrow Island. Western Australia alone has several scattered population groups locally distinguished with given indigenous names: &quot;nunguin&quot; in Kimberley, &quot;walambari&quot; in Pilbara, &quot;wayurta&quot; in the desert areas, and &quot;bilda&quot; in Nullarbor Plain shared with South Australia among many others.

It is also widespread in New Zealand since its introduction in 1850. The common brushtail possum can be found in a variety of habitats, such as forests, semi-arid areas and even cultivated or urban areas. It is mostly a forest inhabiting species, however it is also found in treeless areas. In New Zealand, possums favour broadleaf-podocarp near farmland pastures. In southern beech forests and pine plantations, possums are less common. Overall, brushtail possums are more densely populated in New Zealand than in their native Australia. This may be because Australia has more fragmented eucalypt forests and more predators. In Australia, brushtail possums are threatened by humans, tiger quolls, dogs, foxes, cats, goannas, carpet snakes, and powerful owls. In New Zealand, brushtail possums are threatened only by humans and cats. The IUCN highlight the population trend in Australia as decreasing.

The northern subspecies of the common brushtail possum has declined substantially, with one study in Australia&#x27;s Northern Territory finding a 22% reduction in the extent of occurrence of and a 50% reduction in the breadth of occupied environmental space. Analysis of contemporary occurrence points suggested that the species is contracting towards areas of higher rainfall, lower fire frequency, and higher vegetation cover. 

===Food and foraging===
The common brushtail possum can adapt to numerous kinds of vegetation but it is largely omnivorous. It prefers &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; leaves, but also eats flowers, shoots, fruits, and seeds. It may also consume animal matter such as insects, birds&#x27; eggs and chicks, and other small vertebrates. Brushtail possums may eat three or four different plant species during a foraging trip, unlike some other arboreal marsupials, such as the koala and the greater glider, which focus on single species. The brushtail possum&#x27;s rounded molars cannot cut &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; leaves as finely as more specialised feeders. They are more adapted to crushing their food, which enables them to chew fruit or herbs more effectively. The brushtail possums&#x27; caecum lacks internal ridges and cannot separate coarse and fine particles as efficiently as some other arboreal marsupials. The brushtail possum cannot rely on &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; alone to provide sufficient protein. Its more generalised and mixed diet, however, does provide adequate nitrogen.

===Behaviour===

The common brushtail possum is largely arboreal and nocturnal. It has a mostly solitary lifestyle, and individuals keep their distance with scent markings (urinating) and vocalisations. They usually make their dens in natural places such as tree hollows and caves, but also use spaces in the roofs of houses. While they sometimes share dens, brushtails normally sleep in separate dens. Individuals from New Zealand use many more den sites than those from Australia. Brushtail possums compete with each other and other animals for den spaces, and this contributes to their mortality. This is likely another reason why brushtail possum population densities are smaller in Australia than in New Zealand. Brushtail possums are usually not aggressive towards each other and usually just stare with erect ears. They vocalise with clicks, grunts, hisses, alarm chatters, guttural coughs, and screeching.

===Reproduction and life history===

The common brushtail possum can breed at any time of the year, but breeding tends to peak in spring, from September to November, and in autumn, from March to May, in some areas. Mating is promiscuous and random; some males can sire several young in a season, while over half sire none. In one Queensland population, males apparently need a month of consorting with females before they can mate with them. Females have a gestation period of 16–18 days, after which they give birth to single young. A newborn brushtail possum is only long and weighs only . As usual for marsupials, the newborn may climb, unaided, through the female&#x27;s fur and into the pouch and attach to a teat. The young develops and remains inside the mother&#x27;s pouch for another 4–5 months. A preliminary study inducing ovulation through exposure of hormones resulted in changes to the appearance of mammary glands in females suggesting that mammary glands provide immunological protection to neonates through milk secretions. When older, the young is left in the den or rides on its mother&#x27;s back until it is 7–9 months old. Females reach sexual maturity when they are a year old, and males do so at the end of their second year. Brushtail possums can live up to 13 years in the wild.

Female young have a higher survival rate than their male counterparts due to establishing their home ranges closer to their mothers, while males travel farther in search of new nesting sites, encountering established territories from which they may be forcibly ejected. In New Zealand&#x27;s Ōrongorongo population, female young have been found to continue to associate with their mothers after weaning, and some inherit the prime den sites. A possible competition exists between mothers and daughters for dens, and daughters may be excluded from a den occupied by the mother. In forests with shortages of den sites, females apparently produce more sons, which do not compete directly for den sites, while in forests with plentiful den sites, female young are greater in number.
==Relationship with humans==

The common brushtail possum is considered a pest in some areas, as it is known to cause damage to pine plantations, regenerative forest, flowers, fruit trees, and buildings. Like other possums, it is rather tolerant of humans and can sometimes be hand fed, although it is not encouraged, as their claws are quite sharp and can cause infection or disease to humans if scratched. It is a traditional food source for some Indigenous Australian groups.

===Australia===
Although once hunted extensively for its fur, the common brushtail possum is largely protected throughout Australia. Tasmania gives crop-protection permits to landowners whose property has been damaged.

While its populations are declining in some regions due to habitat loss, urban populations indicate an adaptation to the presence of humans. In some mainland states, possum trapping is permitted when attempting to evict possums from human residences (e.g. roofs), but possums must be released after dusk within 24 hours of capture, no more than 50 m from the trapping site. In some states, e.g. Victoria, trapped possums may be taken to registered veterinarians to be killed. In South Australia, they are fully protected and permits are required for trapping possums in human residences or for keeping or rescuing sick or injured wild possums and other native animals. In Queensland, they can only be trapped by licensed commercial relocators who must release possums within of the point of capture to ensure that an animal is not released into another possum&#x27;s home range (possums are less likely to survive if they are released into a new area where they do not have access to a den or must compete with a neighbouring possum for den space).

===New Zealand===

Since its introduction from Australia by European settlers in the 1850s, the common brushtail possum has become a major threat to New Zealand native forests and birds. It is also a host for the highly contagious bovine tuberculosis. This is not an issue in Australia, where the disease has been eradicated.

By the 1980s, the peak population had reached an estimated 60–70 million, but is now down to an estimated 30 million due to control measures. The New Zealand Department of Conservation controls possum numbers in many areas via the aerial dropping of 1080-laced bait. Hunting is not restricted, but the population seems to be stable despite the annual killing of thousands of the animals.

===Hunting===
Possums are a pest in New Zealand and Tasmania, where they are culled for their meat and fur. However, due to &quot;tuberculosis&quot; being prevalent in many possums across most of New Zealand, possums are generally only eaten in Northland, where the disease does not exist in possums. In Northland, possum meat has even been used in meat pies.

In Tasmania, possum meat is served at some restaurants. On Bruny Island, possum meat is sold at Bruny Island Game Meats, which also sell it at farmer&#x27;s markets, including in Hobart.

<text>At the 1900 Summer Olympics, seven fencing events were contested. 260 fencers from 19 nations competed. The events took place at the Tuileries Garden.

==Medal summary==
==Weekly summary==
The fencing events were spread out over a good deal of time. The competitions began on Monday, 14 May. 

===14–20 May===
* The first round of the amateur foil competition was held on 14 May and 15 May. Judging was subjective, a change from the 3-touch format from four years earlier. 37 of the 54 fencers advanced, including some who had nominally lost their bouts (when the judges felt that both fencers displayed good skill) and excluding some who had nominally won.
* The quarterfinals, repechage, and semifinals were also held for the foil event in the first week. The quarterfinals and repechage were again judged subjectively, but the semifinal was a round-robin pool format with matches won or lost counting towards advancement to the final. The only non-French fencer to advance past this stage was Rudolf Brosch of Austria.

===21–27 May===
* The foil competition continued with the consolation pool and the final on 21 May. These round-robin pools determined the top 16 places in the tournament, with the top 7 going to France as Brosch finished last in the final.
* The first two rounds, the repechage, and the first half of the semifinals of the masters foil event were held this week. Again, early rounds were judged subjectively but the semifinal used match results.

===28 May-3 June===
* The masters foil competition concluded with the second half of the semifinals on 28 May and the consolation and final rounds on 29 May. France again swept the medals, though Italians Antonio Conte and Italo Santelli made strong showings, with 4th and 7th places, respectively.
* Épée made its Olympic debut, with the amateur event beginning with part of the first round on 1 June and 2 June. All rounds of the event consisted of round-robin pools.

===4–10 June===
* The épée competition continued with the second half of the first round, the quarterfinals, and the semifinals. Ramón Fonst of Cuba and Eduardo Camet of Argentina joined 7 French épéeists in advancing to the final.

===11–17 June===
* The masters épée competition began on 11 June, with the semifinals on 13 June. France dominated the competition, taking all of the finals spots.
* On 14 June, the finals of both the masters and amateur épée events were held. France took its third medal sweep in the masters event, but Fonst took the gold in the amateur event to give Cuba its first Olympic medal.
* An unusual event, a competition between the amateurs and masters in the épée, was held on 15 June. The top four fencers in each class played in a one-day round-robin pool in the amateur-master event. Albert Robert Ayat, the winner of the professional event, went undefeated to win the gold medal, but the amateurs took the next three spots, including a silver medal for Fonst to make Cuba one of two nations in 1900 to win a medal with every competition entry (Luxembourg, with a marathon win as their only entry, was the other).

===18–24 June===
* The first round, semifinals, and final of the amateur sabre event were held. The sabre events were much more internationally balanced than the other two weapons, with 3 Austrians, 2 Hungarians, and 3 Frenchmen making the final. France still took the top two spots, giving the host nation its 5th gold medal in 6 attempts.
* The first round and the semifinals of the masters event of the sabre also took place in the sixth week of fencing competition. In the most international field of the events, the 8 fencers advancing to the final hailed from 5 different nations: Italy, France, Russia, Belgium, and Austria.

===25–27 June===
* Fencing competition ended with the final of the masters sabre on Wednesday, 27 June. France won no medals in the event, as Conte and Santelli did even better in the sabre than they had in the foil, winning the gold and silver medals in the sabre. Milan Neralić of Austria took the bronze.

==Participating nations==
A total of 260 fencers from 19 nations (including 3 nations not recognized by the IOC) competed at the Paris Games:

<doc id="228506" wikidata="Q10832" url="?curid=228506" title="Sex doll">
<text>A sex doll (also, joy toy, love doll, fuck doll or blowup doll) is an anthropomorphic sex toy in the size and shape of a sexual partner. The sex doll may consist of an entire body, or just a head, pelvis, or other body part (vagina, anus, mouth, penis, breasts) intended for sexual stimulation. Sex dolls are made from various materials like silicone, TPE (thermoplastic elastomer), or rubber to replicate a lifelike feel. These materials are chosen for their durability and realistic texture, enhancing the overall experience for users. The parts sometimes vibrate and may be moveable and interchangeable. Sex dolls exist in many forms, but are usually distinguished from sex robots, which are anthropomorphic creations designed to be able to engage in more complex interactions.

== History ==

Sex dolls first appear as consumer goods, sold in France beginning in the 1850s through rubber goods magazines as &quot;rubber women&quot; (). These early sex dolls emerged from European and American industry during the 1800s Brazilian rubber boom, alongside the invention of vulcanized rubber. The first documented appearance of these rubber sex dolls is in an article from French newspaper reporting from an exhibition of American rubber products at the 1855 world&#x27;s fair. These goods were heavily criminalized, along with other sex toys produced in France at the time, and thus were produced and sold in small quantities at high cost.

Most longstanding myths of sex dolls&#x27; origin largely stem from one of the earliest recorded appearances of manufactured sex dolls in academic literature, which dates to 1908, in Iwan Bloch&#x27;s &quot;The Sexual Life of Our Time&quot;. Bloch wrote:

Bloch&#x27;s account, and those stemming from it, have been largely debunked in recent scholarship interrogating the origin of sex dolls by Bo Ruberg, which has found that this historicization relies heavily on fictional sources, namely a collection of René Schwaeblé short stories titled and an erotic novel (pseudonymously written by Alphone Momas) titled . The only primary sources for Blotch&#x27;s claims are exaggerated advertising copy.

It has long been speculated that some of the first sex dolls were created by French () and Spanish () sailors in the 16th century who would be isolated during long voyages. These masturbatory dolls were reported to have often made of sewn cloth or old clothes and were a direct predecessor to today&#x27;s sex dolls. The term , however, first appears in-use in a short story from 1893, and refers to sex workers rather than sex dolls. It is only in the 1920s that , without the addition of (translated to &#x27;of rubber&#x27;), comes to mean sex dolls. The first appearance of sailors making use of sex dolls comes in the 1880s, like with sex dolls more generally, in erotic literature. Rubber sex dolls are later advertised to sailors in France in the early 1900s, however there is no archival evidence for widespread practice of sex doll use at sea prior to this.

Similar to the myth of the origin story, the term &quot;Dutch wife&quot; has come to represent the imagined origin of sex dolls. In this narrative, the Dutch either sold dolls to Japanese people during the Rangaku period, or vice versa. This concept derives however from the more banal &quot;bamboo wife&quot; which is a cooling device historically found throughout East and Southeast Asia. This idea comes to stand in for Orientalizing and colonial fantasies of European men&#x27;s sex with Asian women. The term &quot;Dutch wives&quot; is still sometimes used in Japan to refer to sex dolls.

In 1918, Austrian artist Oskar Kokoschka commissioned a life-sized doll of Alma Mahler (whom Kokoschka was in love with) to German puppet maker Hermine Moos, while he was in Dresden. Although intended to simulate Alma and receive his affection, the &quot;Alma doll&quot; did not satisfy Kokoschka and he destroyed it during a party.

German surrealist artist Hans Bellmer has been described as &quot;the father figure of the modern sex doll&quot; for his sex puppets in the 1930s whose more realistic models moved sex dolls further into the future. Bellmer made three dolls, increasingly sophisticated in design, which also made waves in the international art community.

A report that, as part of the Borghild Project, Nazi Germany made sex dolls for soldiers during World War II has not been verified by reliable sources and is now considered to be a hoax. It is however said that the commercial sex doll has its origins in Germany, especially since the creation of the Bild Lilli doll in the 1950s, which was in turn the inspiration for creating the famous Barbie doll.

The production of human simulacra to substitute for human sexual partners took several technological leaps forward in the late 20th century. By the 1970s, vinyl, latex and silicone had become the materials most frequently used in the manufacture of sex dolls; silicone, in particular, allowed a greater degree of realism.

A 1982 attempt to import a consignment of sex dolls into Britain had the unintended consequence of ending the law against importing &quot;obscene or indecent&quot; items that were not illegal to sell within the UK. Having had the dolls seized by Her Majesty&#x27;s Customs and Excise officers, David Sullivan&#x27;s Conegate Ltd. took the case all the way to the European Court of Justice, and won in 1987. Britain was forced to lift its stringent import prohibitions dating from 1876 because for imports from within the European Community they constituted a barrier to free trade under the terms of the Treaty of Rome.

Shin Takagi, founder of the company Trottla, manufactures lifelike child sex dolls in the belief that doing so provides a safe and legal outlet for men expressing pedophilic desires. This has been disputed by paraphilia researcher Peter J. Fagan, who argues that contact with the products would likely have a reinforcing effect, increasing the risk of pedophilic action being taken. Since 2013, Australian officials have confiscated imported shipments of juvenile sex dolls legally classified as child exploitation material.

Sales of sex dolls increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic.

== Contemporary commercial forms ==
Cheaper sex dolls are inflatable, using air. These dolls, representing the lowest price range (less than US$75), are usually made of welded vinyl and bear only a passing resemblance to actual people. They have an artificial and typically crudely designed vagina or penis, but due to their affordability, many users are willing to overlook their shortcomings. They often burst at the seams after a few uses, although they are commonly given as gag gifts and therefore many may not be used at all. In Russia, for some years the Bubble Baba Challenge humorously featured participants river rafting on blowup dolls as a form of entertainment, but in 2013 the race was canceled on &quot;health and safety&quot; grounds.

At the middle market price range ($100 to approximately $1,000), dolls are made of thicker vinyl or heavy latex without welded seams or a polyurethane and silicone mixture, typically surrounding a foam core. Most have plastic mannequin-style heads and styled wigs, plastic or glass eyes, and occasionally properly molded hands and feet. Some vinyl dolls can contain water-filled body areas such as the breasts or buttocks. Latex dolls were made in Hungary, China and France but only the French manufacturer Domax now remains in production. 

The manufacturing process causes most latex dolls to be delivered with a fine coating of zinc oxide covering the skin, which is usually removed by the consumer by placing the doll under the shower. Otherwise, latex is an inert and non-toxic natural material; although a small percentage of users may discover a latex allergy.

The most expensive sex dolls (approximately $1,200 and up) are usually made from silicone (usually above $3,000 at 2016 prices) or thermoplastic elastomer known as TPE. pricing of the dolls on eBay ranges from $200 to $1000 for high quality full size full body TPE dolls. The most prevalent factors governing price are size, weight, and aesthetics. Pricing loosely follows $5 per pound. Some popular models beginning price at $500 have risen in price to as much as $1000. Scaled down size full body TPE mini dolls, full size torsos, and other body parts range in price from under $100 to $300. Dolls made of either material can be very lifelike, with faces and bodies modeled on real people in some instances, with realistic skin material (similar to that used for movie special effects), and with realistic (or even real) hair. These dolls usually have an articulated PVC or metal skeleton with flexible joints that allow them to be positioned in a variety of positions for display and for sexual acts. Silicone or TPE dolls are much heavier than vinyl or latex inflatable ones (which consist mostly of air), but are roughly half the weight of a real human being of comparable size.

Because of their ability to be posed in different positions silicone dolls are popular with artists and photographers as models.

In Japan, sex dolls are known as , which now refers to relatively inexpensive dolls. Their name originates from the term, possibly English, for the thick rattan or bamboo bolster, used to aid sleep in humid countries by keeping one&#x27;s limbs lifted above sweaty sheets. 
Orient Industry is considered to be the leading manufacturer of high-end silicone dolls in Japan, which started using another term around 1998 to distinguish their dolls from the image of inflatable dolls associated with the term &quot;Dutch wife&quot;. The term has stuck and is now used generally to refer to any high-end product.
There is a business, Doru no Mori (Doll Forest) in Tokyo, that rents love dolls and rooms to male customers. In March 2007 the Japanese daily &quot;Mainichi Shimbun&quot; newspaper reported that there are also rental businesses that bring the dolls to the customer&#x27;s home, and that the specialist love-doll magazine &quot;i-doloid&quot; has a print-run of 10,000 copies per issue.

The middle market and high-end market emerged in the US around 1992. The market has grown for two main reasons. Firstly, the last twenty years have seen huge improvements over earlier types of sex dolls, and customers come to realize this through using the web. Secondly, the method of retail purchase has also improved, now showing customers what the actual doll, seams, hair, and even orifices look like.

In China the market has mushroomed on account of the demographic effects of the one-child policy and accordingly numerous new Chinese manufacturers have appeared in recent years.

== Non-standard forms ==
In Japan one can purchase inflatable or stuffed love pillows or &quot;dakimakura&quot; that can be fitted with a cover printed with a life-size picture of a porn star or anime character. Other less common novelty love dolls include overweight, intersex, and alien dolls, which are usable for pleasure but also tend to be given as gag gifts.

Some companies manufacture cloth sex dolls using the same technology that is used to create plush toys. With widespread cultural use of the internet amongst younger generations, numerous forums exist for amateurs who create their own sex dolls from fabric or other materials. There are even mailing lists for discussing techniques and experiences with &quot;MLDs&quot; (material love dolls) .

Some inflatable sex dolls are made in the form of animals, most notably sheep and cows. These dolls are more of a joke gift or party novelty and are often not suitable for sexual use.

== New materials and technologies ==
Silicone dolls were at first made from tin-cure silicone but platinum technology has better longevity, less prone to tears and compression marks. For this reason, the &quot;RealDoll&quot; manufacturer reported switching from the tin to the platinum material in June 2009 and all other manufacturers have followed suit.

Since 2012 or so, a thermoplastic elastomer alternative known as TPE has come into common use particularly by Chinese manufacturers which have enabled realistic dolls to be made which are cheaper than those composed of the high quality expensive platinum cure silicone.

CybOrgasMatrix dolls used an elastic gel, which they claimed to be superior to silicone in elasticity, shape memory, and durability. Both this company and the company &quot;First Androids&quot; once offered pelvic thruster motor, audio capability, and heated orifices, though these options are no longer available. Several modern doll manufacturers now offer the last option on their silicone dolls, with the addition of an internal heating system.

Foam dolls have now become available from EX Doll and SeeDree dolls, in hope of making Sex Dolls a lighter weight. Cloud Climax reports that they can be as low as 9 kg, whilst being a life-sized doll and that the heads are silicone for realism.

== Legal restrictions and issues ==

=== General ===
In 2019, the Israeli media reported on an incident where a European sex dolls company created a sex doll that is based on the Israeli model, Yael Cohen Aris, without her permission. In 2020, the same story was further investigated and reported by &quot;Playboy&quot;, and was mentioned in relation to Deepfake.

The importation of sex dolls for men has been banned in Botswana according to Section 178 of the Botswana Penal Code. The law further abolishes the right to &quot;possess, lend, trade-in, export, import, and or exhibit obscene objects or any objects tending to corrupt morals in Botswana&quot;, which includes sex dolls.

===Austria===
As prostitution is legalized and regulated, there are no legal restrictions concerning sex dolls in Austria and numerous brothels are offering sex dolls for clients. Although sex dolls originally started appearing in Austria around 1980, they gained popularity in 2017 when a brothel started offering sex doll services to clients. This can be attributed to the fact that the dolls have become more realistic in recent years.

In addition to being able to have intercourse with the sex doll, some places allow clients to purchase sex dolls for themselves. One of the biggest laufhauses in Vienna offers sex in the laufhaus with dolls alongside real women.

According to brothel owners who offer sex dolls, the dolls are being properly cleaned after every session. Unprotected sex with sex dolls is also allowed, but it is not advised as there is no guarantee that the dolls are being cleaned after each client.

=== South Korea ===
In 2018, the South Korean Supreme Court ruled to legalize the sale of sex dolls. The issue still remains controversial in the country.

=== China ===
In China, it is not illegal to buy and use sex dolls. In the past year, sex doll experience halls have appeared in many cities in China.

=== United States ===
Sex dolls that look like children have been banned from Florida, Kentucky, Tennessee, South Dakota, and Hawaii.

=== United Kingdom ===
It is illegal to import sex dolls that look like children into the United Kingdom, and the offence carries up to seven years in prison under several acts, one of which is an 1876 customs act governing the importation of obscene articles. However, the law is not specific on what constitutes a child sex doll and as such all sex dolls are technically illegal until decided otherwise by a border agent upon importation and inspection. The only guidelines known by vendors are to ensure the doll is taller than and this can be observed on UK websites since dolls below this height are not available. Other factors that may affect the outcome of a case are the size of the breasts and subjective opinions about the age that the face appears.

=== Myanmar===
In Myanmar, it was highly publicly criticized on October 22, 2022, when people paid obeisance to China-made two silicone sex dolls as the two goddesses Thurathadi and Thiri Devi at the Shwedagon Pagoda. The dolls are owned by an alchemist named Inn Weizzamo. He bought the dolls from China for US$2,400 each, and worshiped them by dressing in royal clothes. On the same day, he was arrested for allegedly causing harm to Buddhism.

The sayadaw Min Thunya (Buddhist University) says that &quot;the act of worshiping two silicone sex dolls in the form of two noble goddesses is an insult to the religion. It&#x27;s really shameful.&quot;

==Sex robots==

In June 2006, Henrik Christensen of the European Robotics Research Network told the UK&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Times&quot; that &quot;people are going to be having sex with robots within five years.&quot;

Reacting to the ongoing development of &quot;sex robots&quot; or &quot;sexbots&quot;, in September 2015, Kathleen Richardson of De Montfort University and Erik Billing of the University of Skövde created the &quot;Campaign Against Sex Robots&quot;, calling for a ban on the creation of anthropomorphic sex robots. They argue that the introduction of such devices would be socially harmful, and demeaning to women and children.

=== Debates over sex dolls and robots ===
The emergence of sex dolls and robots has raised ethical concerns and sparked debates among people. Some argue that they promote sexist objectification and should not be developed or used at all. Others suggest that, if designed ethically, sex robots can have positive effects on individual and social well-being. This would involve safeguarding advanced sentient robots with robocentric ethics and obtaining explicit consent for sexual interaction. Despite these considerations, ethical questions surrounding robot prostitution remain unresolved and continue to fuel debate.

== State of research ==
Compared to pornography for which thousands, and compared to sex robots for which dozens of scientific studies are available, sex dolls, their use and effects have been relatively little researched so far. This is not surprising because sex dolls are a subtype of sex toys, and sex toys as material sexual objects are fairly under-researched in general.

Nevertheless, a systematic review from the year 2020 was able to identify 29 published academic studies on sex dolls. These sex doll studies deal with the following five research questions:

#What are appropriate theoretical conceptualizations of sex dolls?
#How are sex dolls represented in art and media?
#What empirical findings on the use and effect of sex dolls are available through interviews, surveys or analyses of sex doll online forums?
#What therapeutic uses and effects of sex dolls are documented in clinical case studies?
#Should there be a legal regulation of child sex dolls, and if yes, why and how?

Overall, the current state of research shows that sex doll owners (so far, the majority are men) and their uses are diverse and that sex dolls can be associated with negative and positive effects. Likewise, the available empirical studies with sex doll owners indicate that they do not only regard and treat their dolls as “sex” dolls, but sometimes also as “love” dolls or social companions. A clinical case study explained how living with a doll helped a divorced man to overcome relationship trauma and get ready to approach real women again. Psychological theories that can explain the human-doll relationship are, among others, the theory of transitional objects or the theory of parasocial interactions and relationships usually applied to media personas.

In the 2023 study &quot;Exploring the Psychological Characteristics and Risk-related Cognitions of Individuals Who Own Sex Dolls&quot; the authors point out that there is concern that sex doll ownership increases negative social attitudes towards women and the risk of sexual offenses. However, the study found no scientific evidence for this, but rather that doll owners were less likely to commit sexually aggressive acts towards women. Doll owners also tended to view women as &quot;unknowable&quot; and tended to have lower self-esteem.

== In popular culture ==

In the BBC programme &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, aired since 1942 with little interruption, guests were also permitted to bring either a book or a &quot;luxury&quot; in addition to musical recordings. Several chose life-size dolls: Oliver Reed, Ronnie Scott (who settled instead for a saxophone), and Duncan Carse.

The fictional narrator in the Italian writer Tommaso Landolfi&#x27;s comic short story &quot;Gogol&#x27;s Wife&quot; describes several visits to the subject of his biography, Nikolai Gogol. At that renowned 19th century Russian writer&#x27;s residence, the future biographer finds Gogol, referred to throughout as Nikolai Vassilevitch (his personal name and patronymic), with a life-size, anatomically correct blow-up doll. In later visits, the doll is described with more and more human attributes, bringing the story ever more into the realm of fantastic fiction.

<text>An attack submarine or hunter-killer submarine is a submarine specifically designed for the purpose of attacking and sinking other submarines, surface combatants and merchant vessels. In the Soviet and Russian navies they were and are called &quot;multi-purpose submarines&quot;. They are also used to protect friendly surface combatants and missile submarines. Some attack subs are also armed with cruise missiles, increasing the scope of their potential missions to include land targets.

Attack submarines may be either nuclear-powered or diesel–electric (&quot;conventionally&quot;) powered. In the United States Navy naming system, and in the equivalent NATO system (STANAG 1166), nuclear-powered attack submarines are known as SSNs and their anti-submarine (ASW) diesel–electric predecessors are SSKs. In the US Navy, SSNs are unofficially called &quot;fast attacks&quot;.

==History==
===Origins===
During World War II, submarines that fulfilled the offensive surface attack role were termed fleet submarines in the U.S. Navy and &quot;ocean-going&quot;, &quot;long-patrol&quot;, &quot;type 1&quot; or &quot;1st class&quot; by continental European navies.

In the action of 9 February 1945, sank while both were at periscope depth. This was the first and so far only intentional sinking of a submerged submarine by a submerged submarine. &quot;U-864&quot; was snorkeling, thus producing much noise for &quot;Venturer&quot;″s hydrophones (an early form of passive sonar) to detect, and &quot;Venturer&quot; was fortunate in having over 45 minutes to plot the U-boat&#x27;s zig-zag course by observing the snorkel mast. &quot;Venturer&quot;″s commander, James S. &quot;Jimmy&quot; Launders, was astute in assuming the U-boat would execute an &quot;emergency deep&quot; maneuver once it heard the torpedoes in the water, thus the &quot;spread&quot; of four torpedoes immediately available was aimed on that assumption. One hit, sinking the U-boat.

====Beginnings of the attack submarine type====

Following World War II, advanced German submarines, especially the Type XXI U-boat, became available to the Allies, particularly the United States Navy and the Soviet Navy. Initially, the Type XVII U-boat, with a Walter hydrogen peroxide-fueled gas turbine allowing high sustained underwater speed, was thought to be more developed than was actually the case, and was viewed as the submarine technology of the immediate future. However, the Type XXI, streamlined and with a high battery capacity for high submerged speed, was fully developed and became the basis for most non-nuclear submarine designs worldwide through the 1950s. In the US Navy, the Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program (GUPPY) was developed to modernize World War II submarines along the lines of the Type XXI. By 1955 the U.S. Navy was using the term &#x27;attack submarine&#x27; to describe the GUPPY conversions and the first postwar submarines (the and the ).

====Beginnings of a separate hunter-killer submarine type (SSK)====

It was realized that the Soviet Union had acquired Type XXI and other advanced U-boats and would soon be putting their own equivalents into production. In 1948 the US Navy prepared estimates of the number of anti-submarine warfare (ASW)-capable submarines that would be needed to counter the hundreds of advanced Soviet submarines that were expected to be in service by 1960. Two scenarios were considered: a reasonable scenario assuming the Soviets would build to their existing force level of about 360 submarines, and a &quot;nightmare&quot; scenario projecting that the Soviets could build submarines as fast as the Germans had built U-boats, with a force level of 2,000 submarines. The projected US SSK force levels for these scenarios were 250 for the former and 970 for the latter. Additional anti-surface (i.e., &#x27;attack&#x27;), guided missile, and radar picket submarines would also be needed. By comparison, the total US submarine force at the end of World War II, excluding obsolescent training submarines, was just over 200 boats.
A small submarine suitable for mass production was designed to meet the SSK requirement. This resulted in the three submarines of the &quot;K-1&quot; class (later named the &quot;Barracuda&quot; class), which entered service in 1951. At surfaced, they were considerably smaller than the boats produced in World War II. They were equipped with an advanced passive sonar, the bow-mounted BQR-4, but had only four torpedo tubes. Initially, a sonar located around the conning tower was considered, but tests showed that bow-mounted sonar was much less affected by the submarine&#x27;s own noise.

While developing the purpose-built SSKs, consideration was given to converting World War II submarines into SSKs. The less-capable was chosen for this, as some of the deeper-diving - and boats were being upgraded as GUPPYs. Seven &quot;Gato&quot;-class boats were converted to SSKs in 1951–53. These had the bow-mounted BQR-4 sonar of the other SSKs, with four of the six bow torpedo tubes removed to make room for the sonar and its electronics. The four stern torpedo tubes were retained. Two diesel engines were removed, and the auxiliary machinery was relocated in their place and sound-isolated to reduce the submarine&#x27;s own noise.

The Soviets took longer than anticipated to start producing new submarines in quantity. By 1952 only ten had entered service. However, production was soon ramped up. By the end of 1960 a total of 320 new Soviet submarines had been built (very close to the USN&#x27;s 1948 low-end assumption), 215 of them were the Project 613 class (NATO Whiskey class), a smaller derivative of the Type XXI. Significantly, eight of the new submarines were nuclear-powered.

===Nuclear era===
====End of the U.S. conventional hunter-killers (SSK)====

, the world&#x27;s first nuclear submarine, was operational in 1955; the Soviets followed this only three years later with their first Project 627 &quot;Kit&quot;-class SSN (NATO November class). Since a nuclear submarine could maintain a high speed at a deep depth indefinitely, conventional SSKs would be useless against them:

As the development and deployment of nuclear submarines proceeded, in 1957–59 the US Navy&#x27;s SSKs were decommissioned or redesignated and reassigned to other duties. It had become apparent that all nuclear submarines would have to perform ASW missions.

====Other new technologies====

 Research proceeded rapidly to maximize the potential of the nuclear submarine for the ASW and other missions. The US Navy developed a fully streamlined hull form and tested other technologies with the conventional , commissioned in 1953. The new hull form was first operationalized with the three conventional boats and the six nuclear boats, when both classes entered service beginning in 1959. The was declared the &quot;world&#x27;s fastest submarine&quot; following trials, although the actual speed was kept secret.

Sonar research showed that a sonar sphere capable of three-dimensional operation, mounted at the very bow of a streamlined submarine, would increase detection performance. This was recommended by Project Nobska, a 1956 study ordered by Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Arleigh Burke. The one-off in 1960 and the starting in 1961 were the first with a bow-mounted sonar sphere; midships torpedo tubes angled outboard were fitted to make room for the sphere.

====Failure to develop a U.S. nuclear hunter-killer (SSKN)====
&quot;Tullibee&quot; was a type of nuclear-powered SSK; technologically very successful, intentionally slow but ultra-quiet with turbo–electric drive. Her unexpectedly high cost compared with the &quot;Thresher&quot; proved it was impossible to build a low-cost nuclear SSK (several nuclear reactor features could not be scaled down beyond a certain point, including radiation shielding). This result coupled with her lower performance was judged to be not cost-effective and the type was not repeated; the Navy decided to merge the hunter-killer role with the attack submarines, making the terms interchangeable. &quot;Thresher&quot; was faster and had an increased diving depth, carried twice as many torpedoes, included comparable sound silencing improvements, and was commissioned only nine months later.

&quot;Thresher&quot;&#x27;s loss in April 1963 triggered a major redesign of subsequent US submarines known as the SUBSAFE program. However, &quot;Thresher&quot;″s general arrangement and concept were continued in all subsequent US Navy attack submarines.

====Later developments====
Britain commissioned its first nuclear attack submarine in 1963 with a US S5W reactor. At the same time as the &quot;Dreadnought&quot; construction, attempts were made to transfer US reactor technology to Canada and the Netherlands. Admiral Hyman G. Rickover considered such technology to be obvious, but a visit to the Soviet nuclear icebreaker reportedly &quot;appalled him&quot; and convinced him that he should cancel the transfers to retain secrets.

The first fully streamlined Soviet attack submarines were the Project 671 &quot;Yorsh&quot; class (NATO Victor I class), which first entered service in 1967.

China commissioned its first nuclear attack submarine (NATO Han class) in 1974, and France its first in 1983.

The only time in history that a nuclear attack submarine engaged and sank an enemy warship was in the Falklands War, when on 2 May 1982 the British nuclear submarine torpedoed and sank the Argentine light cruiser .

The United States commissioned the first &quot;Seawolf&quot; and &quot;Virginia&quot;-class nuclear powered submarines in 1997 and 2004 respectively.

As of 2021 Brazil has a nuclear attack submarine under construction, India has finalized a nuclear attack submarine interim design, and Australia has started a nuclear attack submarine program under the AUKUS security pact with UK and US assistance.

===Modern conventional submarines===
Conventional attack submarines have however remained relevant throughout the nuclear era, with the British class and the Soviet , , and classes being good examples which served during the Cold War. 

With the advent of air-independent propulsion technology, these submarines have grown more and more capable. Examples include the Type 212, and classes of submarine. The US Navy leased to perform the opposing force role during ASW exercises tactics. The &quot;Gotland&quot; caused a stir in 2005 when during training it &quot;sank&quot; the American carrier .

<doc id="228513" wikidata="Q332837" url="?curid=228513" title="Stephen Byers">
<text>Stephen John Byers (born 13 April 1953) is a British Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Wallsend between 1992 and 1997, and North Tyneside from 1997 to 2010. He served in the Cabinet from 1998 to 2002, and was implicated in the MP expenses scandal and retired from politics in 2010.

During Byers&#x27; ministerial career, he was Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, and Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions in the Cabinet.

== Early career ==
Stephen Byers was born in Wolverhampton. He was educated at Wymondham College, a state-run day and boarding school, Chester City Grammar School and the Chester College of Further Education. He then gained a law degree at Liverpool John Moores University and became a law lecturer at Newcastle Polytechnic (now Northumbria University) in 1977, a post he retained until his election as a Member of Parliament in 1992.

Byers was elected as a councillor to the North Tyneside District Council in 1980 and was its deputy leader from 1985 until he became an MP in 1992. Reportedly a former supporter of the entryist Militant group once active within the Labour Partya claim which he says is untrue Byers had publicly rejected the group&#x27;s approach by 1986. In the 1983 general election, he contested the Conservative stronghold seat of Hexham, finishing in third place and some 14,000 votes behind the former Cabinet minister Geoffrey Rippon. He was first elected to Parliament in the 1992 general election in Wallsend, a Labour stronghold, following the retirement of Ted Garrett, and secured a majority of 19,470.

In 1993, Byers joined the influential Home Affairs Select committee. He became an ally of Tony Blair, a fellow northeastern Labour MP, who was also in favour of &#x27;modernising&#x27; the Labour Party. Blair gave him a job as soon as he became the Leader of the Opposition, placing Byers in the Whips&#x27; Office. He became a spokesman for the Department for Education and Employment in 1995, and he identified himself as an &quot;outrider&quot; for the New Labour project, regularly floating radical ideas on Blair&#x27;s behalf to test reaction. An instance of this is when Byers briefed journalists in 1996 saying that the party might sever its links with the trade unions. Byers was swiftly appointed to shadow portfolios and became the Minister for School Standards with the title of Minister of State at the Department of Education and Employment following the victorious 1997 general election. While in this post, Byers drew attention to himself in a BBC interview promoting a Government numeracy drive, when he mistakenly said 8 times 7 was 54.

His Wallsend constituency was abolished in 1997, and he was elected for the equally safe North Tyneside constituency with a 26,643-vote majority.

== Cabinet appointment ==
He joined the Cabinet in July 1998, as Chief Secretary to the Treasury and became a Member of the Privy Council. After the sudden resignation of Peter Mandelson, Byers was appointed as Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in December 1998. After the 2001 general election, he was made Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government &amp; the Regions.

=== MG Rover ===
Byers was heavily criticised for his part in the collapse of MG Rover Group. Byers, as Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, advocated the 2000 deal with the Phoenix Consortium instead of the bid from Alchemy Partners, a successful turnaround private equity investor that would have slimmed down the business. Although this deal prolonged the existence of the group by five years, it ultimately collapsed at extensive cost to the British tax payers while giving large profits from a dowry given by the seller BMW to the Phoenix Consortium. Byers responded to this criticism in his submission to the Trade and Industry committee, stating that his actions had largely been in line with government policy and that the long slow collapse of MG Rover Group had been preferable to a short sudden collapse.

=== Railtrack ===
The first source of controversy in the Railtrack incident was the decision, taken at short notice with disregard for the regulator Tom Winsor, and implemented over a weekend, to ask the High Court to put the privatised railway infrastructure company Railtrack into railway administration, on 7 October 2001. This ultimately led to the creation of Network Rail, which effectively renationalised Britain&#x27;s railway infrastructure company. The British Office for National Statistics insisted that the placement of Network Rail in the private sector was correct. Byers later admitted that he had not been truthful.

Byers&#x27; decision angered those private investors who had lost money, and under pressure from The City, the government eventually had to offer compensation. The action also led to the largest class legal action ever seen in the British courts.

=== Exit from the Cabinet ===
In late 2001, it was revealed that Byers&#x27; political adviser, Jo Moore, had sent an email on 11 September 2001, suggesting that the September 11, 2001 attacks made it &quot;a very good day to get out anything we want to bury&quot;. Moore and Byers survived the resulting outrage, but, in February 2002, the public uproar broke out again. A leaked email from the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions&#x27;s head of news, Martin Sixsmith, a former BBC news reporter, seemed to warn Moore not to &quot;bury&quot; any more bad news on the day of Princess Margaret&#x27;s funeral, implying that she was attempting to do so. On 15 February, the resignations of both Moore and Sixsmith were announced. Later on, however, Sixsmith stated that he had not agreed to go, but rather that Byers had insisted on the head of news&#x27; departure as his price to pay for losing Moore. In May it was confirmed by the Department that Byers had announced Sixsmith&#x27;s resignation prematurely, though the Government said that this was due to a misunderstanding, and he had done nothing wrong.

Byers&#x27; troubles continued over the following months. The Labour-dominated House of Commons Transport Select Committee criticised the party&#x27;s transport strategy, and a long-running row over Byers&#x27; decision as Trade Secretary to allow pornographic-magazine publisher Richard Desmond to buy the &quot;Daily Express&quot; newspaper returned to the limelight. The pressure on Byers was too much; he resigned on 28 May 2002, and was replaced by Alistair Darling.

== Return to backbenches ==
On the backbenches, Byers kept up pressure for the Labour Party to keep to the centre ground. In August 2006, he suggested that Labour heir-apparent, Gordon Brown, should discard the inheritance tax to prove his &quot;New Labour&quot; credentials to Middle England. This suggestion was widely criticised by many MPs, who claimed that the publicity surrounding Byers&#x27; plan would &quot;frighten constituents in the high-priced south into believing they would have to pay death duties, when most won&#x27;t&quot;.

On 14 November 2009, he announced that he would be stepping down from Parliament at the 2010 general election.

Following the criticism of the Prime Minister over the budget of 2007, which dismissed the ten per cent starting rate of income tax as well as that of 2008, which included a planned two per cent rise in fuel duties, Byers accused Gordon Brown of manipulating the tax system for &quot;tactical advantage&quot; and urged an &quot;immediate halt&quot; to proposals to increase taxes on motorists. He also condemned the government&#x27;s proposed inheritance tax reforms that had been launched in response to Opposition proposals to reform the tax. He went on to urge the government to carry out a fundamental rethinking of tax policy.

== Expenses ==
As part of a series of reports highlighting MPs&#x27; expenses claims, on 10 May 2009, &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; reported that Byers had claimed more than in second home allowances for a London flat owned by his partner, where the MP lived rent-free. Allegedly included in his expenses claims was £27,000 for redecoration, maintenance, and appliances for the property.

== Lobbyist investigation ==

In March 2010, Byers was among the politicians caught out by undercover journalists who were posing as lobbyists from an international company. The journalists were from &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; and filming for the Channel 4 investigatory series &quot;Dispatches&quot;. He was shown describing himself as a &quot;cab for hire&quot; and offering to lobby his parliamentary contacts in support of the fictitious company for a financial payment of between £3,000 and £5,000 per day. Byers claimed to have influenced outcomes for National Express and Tesco through his relationships with Lord Adonis, Transport Secretary, and Lord Mandelson, Business Secretary, respectively. He claimed that he phoned Mandelson to put a stop to &quot;massively bureaucratic&quot; food labelling regulations after he had been contacted by Tesco. He later withdrew his name for consideration by the fictitious lobbying company via email, claiming he had over-stated his role, writing, &quot;I have not spoken to Andrew Adonis or Peter Mandelson about the matters I mentioned&quot;. When the story broke, National Express and Tesco also denied there was any truth in Byers&#x27; statements. Byers referred himself to John Lyon, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. Byers expressed confidence that Lyon would clear his name, but he was eventually banned from the parliamentary estate. On 22 March 2010, Byers&#x27; administrative suspension from the membership of the Parliamentary Labour Party was announced alongside those of Patricia Hewitt, Geoff Hoon and Margaret Moran. However, all four remained members of the Labour Party itself.

On 9 December 2010, Geoff Hoon along with Stephen Byers and Richard Caborn were banned from parliament, the Standards and Privileges Committee banned Geoff Hoon for a minimum five years, for his was the most serious breach, whilst Byers received two years and Caborn six months.

<text>The Acrobatidae are a small family of gliding marsupials containing two genera, each with a single species, the feathertail glider (&quot;Acrobates pygmaeus&quot;) from Australia and feather-tailed possum (&quot;Distoechurus pennatus&quot;) from New Guinea.

This family of the order Diprotodontia, which can be found in the east coast and inland of Australia and in some islands of New Guinea, is characterized by their very small size, which has side effects: because their mass-to-surface-area ratio is so small, heat escapes quicker from their bodies than it would in larger animals (the larger the mass-to-surface-area ratio, the harder it is to get rid of heat). Therefore, when temperature drops or food is scarce, they have trouble maintaining their body temperature and they enter a state known as torpidity (not to be confused with hibernation, which is not known in marsupials) which can last between one day and two weeks. In this state, the animal&#x27;s breathing slows down, its temperature drops to almost that of its surroundings, and the animal becomes unresponsive.

The earliest fossils of this family are teeth from the Riversleigh World Heritage Area, assigned to both extant genera (&quot;Acrobates&quot; and &quot;Distoechurus&quot;). These fossils suggest that both genera have rather early origins, that &quot;Acrobates&quot; originally inhabited closed forest environments before transitioning to open forests, and that &quot;Distocheurus&quot; originally inhabited Australia before dispersing to New Guinea and eventually going extinct in Australia.

<text>The feathertail glider (Acrobates pygmaeus), also known as the pygmy gliding possum, pygmy glider, pygmy phalanger, flying phalanger and flying mouse, is a species of marsupial native to eastern Australia. It is the world&#x27;s smallest gliding mammal and is named for its long feather-shaped tail.

A second species, the broad-toed feathertail glider (&quot;Acrobates (Dromicia) frontalis&quot;, De Vis 1887) is recognised by some authors based on unpublished genetic studies and cryptic morphological differences in toe and tail characteristics. With this recognition, it is suggested that &quot;Acrobates pygmaeus&quot; takes the common name narrow-toed feathertail glider.

==Description==
At just in head-and-body length and weighing about , the feathertail glider is only around the size of a small mouse, and is the world&#x27;s smallest gliding mammal. The fur is soft and silky, and is a uniform greyish brown on the upper body, and white on the underside. There are rings of dark fur around the eyes, the rhinarium is hairless and deeply cleft, and the ears are moderately large and rounded. The glider also has an unusually large number of whiskers, sprouting from the snout and cheeks, and from the base of each ear.

Like other gliding mammals, the feathertail glider has a patagium stretching between the fore and hind legs. Only reaching the elbows and knees, this is smaller than that of the petaurid gliding possums, although the presence of a fringe of long hairs increases its effective area. The tail is about the same length as the head and body combined, oval in cross-section, only slightly prehensile, and has very short fur except for two distinctive rows of long, stiff hairs on either side. This gives the tail the appearance of a feather or a double-sided comb. The hindfeet possess enlarged, opposable first digits, which unlike all the other toes on both fore and hind feet, lack claws.

The tongue is long and thin, reaching as much as , and has numerous long papillae that give it a brush-like appearance. This improves the animal&#x27;s ability to collect pollen and consume semi-liquid food. The structure of the ear is also unusual, since the animal possesses a unique bony disc with a narrow crescent-shaped slit just in front of the eardrum. The function of this bone is unclear, but it may act as a Helmholtz resonator and enhance sensitivity to certain frequencies of sound. The brain has been recorded as weighing .

The female has two vaginae, which merge into a single sinus before opening into a cloaca together with the rectum. The pouch opens towards the front, as is common in diprotodont marsupials, and contains four teats.

==Distribution and habitat==
Feathertail gliders are found across the eastern seaboard of continental Australia, from northern Queensland to Victoria and extreme south-eastern South Australia. There are no recognised subspecies. They inhabit a wide range of forest types across the region, from sea level to at least . Fossils belonging to the genus &quot;Acrobates&quot; have been identified from deposits in Queensland dating back to 0.5 million years ago, during the late Pleistocene.

==Behaviour and biology==

Feathertail gliders are omnivorous, feeding on nectar, pollen, and arthropods such as moths, ants, and termites. They are arboreal, and although they do occasionally descend to the ground to forage, they spend as much as 87% of their time over above the ground, particularly in eucalyptus trees. They are nocturnal, spending the day resting in nests in tree hollows, lined with leaves or shredded bark. They are social animals, and up to five may share a single nest, especially during the breeding season.

They are highly adept climbers, able to cling to the smooth trunks of eucalyptus trees. In experiments, they have even proved able to climb vertical panes of glass, a feat that is due to a combination of fine skin ridges and sweat that allow their feet to function as suction cups. Movement through the trees is aided by their gliding ability; they are able to glide as far as , and typically do so three to five times every hour through the night.

Feathertail gliders do not hibernate as such, but are capable of entering torpor during cold weather at any time of the year. Torpor can last for several days, during which time the animal&#x27;s body temperature can drop to as low as and oxygen consumption to just 1% of normal. Torpid gliders curl into a ball, wrapping their tail around themselves and folding their ears flat, and often huddling together with up to four other individuals to reduce heat loss and conserve energy.

The breeding season lasts from July to January in Victoria, and may be longer further to the north. Females typically give birth to two litters of up to four young in a season, and are able to mate again shortly after the first litter is born. The second litter then enters embryonic diapause, and is not born until the first litter has finished weaning at about 105 days. Multiple paternity is common, even within litters, as the females are sexually promiscuous. The young remain in the pouch for the first 65 days of life, and the maximum lifespan is about five years.

==In captivity==
Taronga Zoo (Sydney, Australia) was the first zoo to breed feathertail gliders in captivity. The New Zoo in Poznań, Poland, was first European zoo to begin exhibiting feather-tail gliders in 1999 (their animals originated from Taronga Zoo stock). Some of the feathertail gliders born in Poznań have been sent to other European zoos, meaning that the entire European captive population is of Poznań descent.

==In culture==
A feathertail glider was featured on the reverse of the Australian 1-cent coin until 1991 when the 1-cent denomination was discontinued.

<text>is a Japanese science fiction original video animation (OVA) short film created and animated by Makoto Shinkai. It follows the lives of two close childhood friends, a boy and a girl, who are separated when the girl is sent into space to fight in a war against aliens. As the 15-year-old girl goes deeper and deeper into space, the texts she sends take longer to reach the Earth; the film simultaneously follows her battles and the boy&#x27;s life as he receives her texts over the years.

The OVA premiered in Japan in February 2002 in an advance screening. It was followed by two DVD releases on April 19 and October 6, 2002. ADV Films licensed the OVA for release in North America and the United Kingdom, Madman Entertainment licensed it for Australasia, and Anime Limited licensed it for the United Kingdom. In 2002, it won the Animation Kobe award for packaged work. It also won the 2003 Seiun Award for Best Media. It was very positively received by critics, who praised its artistic dimension, plot, and music; the English-language version, however, was criticized for its dubbing.

The OVA was adapted into a drama CD by Pioneer LDC and a novel was written by Waku Ōba, illustrated by Makoto Shinkai and Kou Yaginuma, and published by Media Factory&#x27;s imprint MF Bunko J. Makoto Shinkai adapted a manga from the OVA, illustrated by Mizu Sahara; Kodansha serialized it in its manga magazine, &quot;Afternoon&quot;, from April 2004, and released the manga as a one-shot on February 23, 2005. The manga was licensed for a North American release by Tokyopop, which published it on August 1, 2006.

==Plot==
A schoolgirl named Mikako Nagamine (Mika Shinohara (original Japanese), Sumi Muto (Japanese), Cynthia Martinez (English)) is recruited into the UN Space Army to fight in a war against a group of aliens called the Tarsiansnamed after the Tharsis region of Mars where they were first encountered. As a Special Agent, Mikako pilots a giant robotic mecha called a Tracer as part of a fighting squadron attached to the spacecraft carrier &quot;Lysithea&quot;. When the &quot;Lysithea&quot; leaves Earth to search for the Tarsians, Mikako&#x27;s friend Noboru Terao (Makoto Shinkai (original Japanese), Chihiro Suzuki (Japanese), Adam Colon (English)) remains on Earth. The two continue to communicate across space using the e-mail facilities on their mobile telephones. As the &quot;Lysithea&quot; travels deeper into space, messages take increasingly longer to reach Noboru on Earth, and the time-lag of their correspondence eventually spans years.

The narrative begins in 2047. Mikako is apparently alone in a hauntingly empty city, trying to contact people through her mobile telephone. She wakes up in her Tracer orbiting an extrasolar planet. She then goes to Agartha, the fictional fourth planet of the Sirius Solar System. Mikako sends an e-mail to Noboru (which shows the date 2047-09-16), with the subject &quot;I am here&quot;, which would reach him eight years later. Some flashes of imagery, perhaps indicative of memory, a hallucination, or even a mystical encounter, are then shown. The room shown at the beginning of the animation is presented again; Mikako is squatting in the corner, sobbing and pleading with her doppelganger to let her see Noboru again so she can tell him she loves him.

The ship&#x27;s alarm warns Mikako that the Tarsians are surrounding her, but she does not understand. A climactic battle ensues. On Earth, Noboru receives the message almost nine years later. At Agartha, three of the four carriers equipped with the warp engines which brought the expeditionary force to Sirius have been destroyed. The &quot;Lysithea&quot; is still intact after Mikako joins the fight and stops its destruction. After winning the battle, Mikako lets her damaged Tracer drift in space.

In the manga, 16-year-old Mikako sends a message to 25-year-old Noboru, telling him that she loves him. By this time, Noboru himself has joined the UN, which has launched a rescue mission for the Lysithea. When Mikako hears that the UN is sending help for their rescue, she consults a list of people on the mission, and finds that Noboru is among them. The manga ends with Mikako saying that they will definitely meet again.

==Production==
&quot;Voices of a Distant Star&quot; was written, directed and produced by Makoto Shinkai on his Power Mac G4 using LightWave, Adobe Photoshop 5.0, Adobe After Effects 4.1 and Commotion 3.1 DV software. Around June 2000, Shinkai drew the first picture for &quot;Voices&quot;of a girl holding a mobile telephone in a cockpit.

Shinkai said the OVA was inspired by &quot;Dracula&quot; and &quot;Laputa&quot;. He stated that production took seven months to complete. He said another inspiration was his frequent sending of text messaging to his wife when he was working. Shinkai cited the availability of digital hardware and software tools for image production at his workplace, Falcom, and friends&#x27; view that individual film production could occur because of the improvement of consumer electronics.

Makoto and his then girlfriend, Mika Shinohara, provided the voice acting for the working dub. A second Japanese dub was later created for the DVD release with professional voice actors. Makoto&#x27;s friend Tenmon, who had worked with Makoto&#x27;s video game company, provided the soundtrack. The song and film were created together in sync during storyboarding. Sometimes, the timing of the animation had to be changed to match the music.

The ending theme to the OVA, &quot;Through the Years and Far Away (Hello, Little Star)&quot;, was composed by Tenmon, with lyrics written by K. Juno and sung by Low.

==Media==
===OVA===
The &quot;Voices of a Distant Star&quot; OVA was directed, written and produced by Makoto Shinkai. Shinkai and his fiancé, Mika Shinohara, provided the voices of the characters for the original video. The OVA was released for an advanced screening in February 2002. Yoshihiro Hagiwara produced the DVD release, and the voice actors were Chihiro Suzuki and Sumi Mutoh. CoMix Wave Inc. released it on DVD on April 19, 2002. A DVD Book version of the story was released by Tokuma Shoten on October 6, 2002.

In July 2002, ADV Films announced it had licensed &quot;Voices of a Distant Star&quot; for a North American release. Steven Foster, director of ADV Films, directed the dubbing of the film into English, with voices provided by Adam Colon and Cynthia Martinez. ADV Films released the North American DVD on June 10, 2003. On June 30, 2003, ADV recalled the North American DVDs because they failed to include the original Japanese tracks made by Shinkai and Shinohara. ADV Films UK released the DVD in the United Kingdom on November 17, 2003. ADV Films UK also released a Shinkai Collection DVD set, containing &quot;Voices of a Distant Star&quot; and &quot;The Place Promised in Our Early Days&quot;, on September 3, 2007. Anime Limited has since taken over ADV Film&#x27;s license for the film and has announced DVD and Blu-ray twin-pack releases of &quot;Voices of a Distant Star&quot; and &quot;The Place Promised in Our Early Days&quot; in the UK. The film was licensed in Australasia by Madman Entertainment, which released the DVD on October 15, 2003.

The film was licensed in France by Kazé, in Italy by D/visual, in Russia by XLM Media, in Taiwan by Proware Multimedia International. Crunchyroll streamed the film for free for 48 hours beginning on March 5, 2010, to celebrate Shinkai as director. 
On March 10, 2022, GKIDS announced that they have licensed &quot;Voices of a Distant Star&quot;, along with three other works by Makoto Shinkai, for North American home video release in 2022; the film was included as a bonus feature on the Blu-ray release of &quot;5 Centimeters per Second&quot; on June 7.

===Other===
A drama CD was released by Pioneer LDC on June 25, 2002. A novel was adapted from the OVA by Waku Ōba and illustrated by Makoto Shinkai and Kou Yaginuma. The novel was published by Media Factory&#x27;s imprint MF Bunko J on July 25, 2002.

The OVA was adapted into a manga by Makoto Shinkai and illustrated by Mizu Sahara. It was serialized in Kodansha&#x27;s manga magazine, &quot;Afternoon&quot; from April 2004. Kodansha released the manga in one volume on February 23, 2005. The manga was licensed for a North American release by Tokyopop, which published the manga on August 1, 2006. The manga was also licensed in Italy by D/visual, in Germany by Egmont Manga &amp; Anime and in Portugal by Panini Comics. The manga was re-licensed in English by Vertical. A second novel, &quot;Words of Love/Across the Stars&quot;, was written by Arata Kanoh and initially released in 2006, although it would not get an English translation and release by Vertical until 2019.

==Reception==
&quot;Voices of A Distant Star&quot; has received the Special Prize at the 6th Japan Media Arts Festival. It has also won the Animation Kobe for packaged work in 2002 and the 2003 Seiun Award for best media. The film was listed 100th on DVD Verdict&#x27;s Top 100 DVD Films list.

Anime News Network&#x27;s Jonathan Mays criticized Steven Foster&#x27;s dubbing of the film. He said, &quot;Foster carelessly omits critical details, completely rewrites some scenes, misinterprets emotions, and even adds new dialogue where the original track had silence&quot;. In an Anime News Network interview, Foster said he &quot;made some changes to make the jokes more accessible&quot;. Mays also said, &quot;The animation is breathtaking. Shinkai&#x27;s backgrounds have very few equals. The character designs look uninspired, but paired with the animator&#x27;s beautifully realized worlds, the generic appearance fades into the magnificence of the scene.&quot; He said Shinkai&#x27;s use of lighting is &quot;masterful&quot;, &quot;incredibly realistic&quot; and conveys the characters&#x27; moods well. He called the characters &quot;unoriginal&quot;. DVD Verdict&#x27;s Rob Lineberger commended the music, saying &quot;the simple score infuses the animation with meaning. Solitary piano notes are sluggish, as though the pianist lacked the enthusiasm needed to pick up his fingers. When the action kicks in, it arrives with a sonic punch from 5.1 speakers. Rockets scream around you, birds move overhead, engines thrum quietly in your wake. The soundtrack does what it is supposed to do: transport you to another world&quot;.

THEM Anime Review&#x27;s Carlos Ross said, &quot;The voice-acting is remarkable, the directing is solid, and music is quite competent. But the real kicker here is the animation quality, which actually equals (and sometimes exceeds) that of excellent television series like &quot;Vandread&quot; and &quot;Full Metal Panic&quot; ... there is a remarkable amount of storyline; the plot is well-written and executed, and never gets a chance to be too drawn out. And Shinkai gives equal time to the slick action sequences and the well-handled, genuinely touching romance&quot;. IGN&#x27;s A.E. Sparrow said, &quot;While [the film] was visually one of the best pieces of eye-candy I have seen in a year or so, it&#x27;s ultimately a voice track over a sequence of pretty pictures. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it was absolutely beautiful, but it left me wanting more&quot;. Mania&#x27;s Chris Beveridge commended ADV Films for obtaining the original computer files that were used to create it. He said, &quot;the transfer here is simply gorgeous. Colors are amazingly lush and deep, saturated without bleeding. Cross coloration is non-existent and only a few very minor areas of aliasing occur. The only real &#x27;flaw&#x27; that I could see with this transfer is during some of the panning sequences up and down, there&#x27;s a slight stutter that&#x27;s simply inherent in the materials&quot;. DVDs Worth Watching&#x27;s Johanna Draper Carlson said, &quot;the character designs are familiar and uninspired, and the cross-cutting choppy&quot;.

===Manga===
IGN&#x27;s A.E. Sparrow said that compared with the film, the manga has &quot;a healthy amount of additional storylines, characters and dialogue&quot;. He also said, &quot;Mizu Sahara&#x27;s artwork brings a bit of clarity to scenes that might have come off as muddled in the anime&quot;. Anime News Network&#x27;s Theron Martin said the manga has &quot;strong storytelling which carries good emotional appeal, fleshes out the original anime&quot; but said it &quot;unnecessarily adds on to the ending&quot;, and that &quot;character designs were not Shinkai&#x27;s strong point, and Sahara&#x27;s are only a slight improvement&quot;.

Manga Worth Reading&#x27;s Johanna Draper Carlson said, &quot;the art is denser than in many manga, with toned backgrounds anchoring the drawn world. Faces are often in shadow, suggesting separation and loss.&quot; Pop Culture Shock&#x27;s Melinda Beasi wrote, &quot;the manga is absolutely beautiful. The art is nicely detailed and very expressive, and the panel layouts, including the placement and style of dialogue and narrative text, make the story visually interesting and easy to follow&quot;. She also said, &quot;Sahara also spends more time exploring both Mikako&#x27;s and Noboru&#x27;s feelings about Mikako&#x27;s appointment to the Lysithea, which is very revealing for both characters&quot;. Mania.com&#x27;s Sakura Eries said, &quot;there&#x27;s not a lot of detail in the backgrounds, the mecha designs are dull, and the warp scenes, which were so spectacular in the anime, don&#x27;t make much of an impact&quot;.

<text>The Lover (French: &quot;L&#x27;Amant&quot;) is an autobiographical novel by Marguerite Duras, published in 1984 by Les Éditions de Minuit. It has been translated into 43 languages and was awarded the 1984 Prix Goncourt. It was adapted to film in 1992 as &quot;The Lover&quot;.

==Plot summary==

Set against the backdrop of French Indochina, &quot;The Lover&quot; reveals the intimacies and intricacies of a clandestine romance between a pubescent girl from a financially strapped French family and an older, wealthy Chinese-Vietnamese man.

In 1929, a 15-year-old nameless girl is traveling by ferry across the Mekong Delta, returning from a holiday at her family home in the town of Sa Đéc to her boarding school in Saigon. She attracts the attention of a 27-year-old son of a Chinese business magnate, a young man of wealth and heir to a fortune. He strikes up a conversation with the girl; she accepts a ride back to town in his chauffeured limousine.

Compelled by the circumstances of her upbringing, this girl, the daughter of a bankrupt, manic depressive widow, is newly awakened to the impending and all-too-real task of making her way alone in the world. Thus, she becomes his lover, until he bows to the disapproval of his father and breaks off the affair.

For her lover, there is no question of the depth and sincerity of his love, but it is not until much later that the girl acknowledges to herself her true feelings.

== Published versions ==

There are two published versions of &quot;The Lover&quot;: one written in the form of an autobiography, without any superimposed temporal structures, as the young girl narrates in first-person; the other, called &quot;The North China Lover&quot; and released in conjunction with the film version of the work, is in film script form, in the third person, with written dialogue and without internal monologue. This second version also contains more humor than the original.

In the first version of Avital Inbar&#x27;s Hebrew transliteration (Maariv publishers, 1986, page 11), there is an excerpt, dictated by Marguerite Duras on the phone to her translator; a section that does not appear in any other version of the book.

Barbara Bray&#x27;s English translation won the Scott Moncrieff Prize and PEN/Book-of-the-Month Club Translation Prize in 1986.

==Real-life connections==

Duras published &quot;The Lover&quot; when she was 70, 55 years after she met Léo, the Chinese man of her story (his legal name was Huỳnh Thủy Lê). She wrote about her experience in three works: The &quot;Sea Wall&quot;, &quot;The Lover&quot;, and &quot;The North China Lover&quot;.

<doc id="228526" wikidata="Q8364" url="?curid=228526" title="( ) (album)">
<text>( ) (also referred to as Svigaplatan, which translates to The Bracket Album) is the third studio album by Icelandic post-rock band Sigur Rós, released on 28 October 2002. It comprises eight untitled tracks, divided into two parts: the first four tracks are lighter and more optimistic, while the latter four are bleaker and more melancholic. The two-halves are divided by a 36-second silence, and the album opens and closes with a click of distortion. Lead singer Jón Þór Birgisson (&quot;Jónsi&quot;) sang the album&#x27;s lyrics entirely in &quot;Hopelandic&quot;, a made-up language consisting of gibberish words. &quot;( )&quot; reached No. 51 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and received acclaim from music critics, although some reviewers found the album weaker than the band&#x27;s previous album .

This is the first album to feature drummer Orri Páll Dýrason who joined the band in 1999, replacing their previous drummer Ágúst Ævar Gunnarsson.

==Production==
The album&#x27;s title consists of two opposing parentheses, representing either the album&#x27;s two-halves, or the idea that the album has no title, leaving the listener free to determine it. Members of the band have referred to &quot;( )&quot; as &quot;Svigaplatan&quot;, which translates to &quot;The Bracket Album&quot;. In the credits of the film &quot;Heima&quot;, it is referred to as &quot;The Untitled Album&quot;. The outside packaging of &quot;( )&quot; consists of a plastic protective sleeve with two parentheses cut out, revealing the image printed on the CD case underneath. There are four versions of this cover art, which consist of modified photographs of nature around the band&#x27;s Mosfellsbær studio, sold in four parts of the world: Europe, the United States, Australia, and Japan. In Iceland, all four cover designs are sold. The back of the packaging shows an image of a sleepwalking boy, adapted from a photograph by John Yang. In 2011, Yang&#x27;s daughter, Naomi Yang, of the band Galaxie 500, said that the band used the image without permission or payment to her father. There are no liner notes or production credits included, although packaged with the album is a booklet of twelve blank pages, on which listeners are invited to write or draw their own interpretations of the album&#x27;s music. A limited edition version of &quot;( )&quot; released in Spain includes a 94-page book of contemporary art.

&quot;( )&quot; was co-produced and engineered by Ken Thomas, who also worked with the band on their previous album, . This is the first album Sigur Rós recorded at their studio based in Álafoss, Mosfellsbær, a small rural town outside Reykjavík, Iceland. The band refers to the studio as &quot;Sundlaugin&quot;, or &quot;The Pool&quot;. &quot;( )&quot; includes the work of the string quartet Amiina. &quot;( )&quot; was given more production and recording time than &quot;Ágætis byrjun&quot;, although lead singer Jónsi considers the &quot;( )&quot; album &quot;less polished&quot; than its predecessor. He characterized the record as being &quot;much more bare and alive and there are far fewer little slick things and much less sweet stuff.&quot; The strings of &quot;Ágætis byrjun&quot; were recorded in just two days, while two weeks were given for their recording on &quot;( )&quot;. In addition, the former was performed by the Iceland Symphony Orchestra, while the latter was done by Amiina. Because of this, the string parts required less preparation prior to recording. The band &quot;just let them &#x27;jam&#x27; in the studio until everybody was happy&quot;, according to Jónsi.

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;( )&quot; consists of eight tracks divided in half by thirty-six seconds of silence which, in concept, replicates the separation of two sides of a gramophone record. Ironically, on the actual vinyl version of the record, the thirty-six seconds of silence occurs in the middle of side 2 (the vinyl consists of 4 sides). The first half of the album is &quot;light and optimistic&quot; musically, with a heavier emphasis on the use of keyboards than guitar, and the sampling of Jónsi&#x27;s voice. The second half is more melancholic, playing with the emotions of the listener, as described by Jónsi. None of the tracks on &quot;( )&quot; have titles; band guitarist and keyboardist Kjartan Sveinsson said of this choice, &quot;we didn&#x27;t want to put titles on the record just because there are supposed to be titles on the record.&quot; The songs are listed as &quot;Untitled #1&quot;, &quot;Untitled #2&quot;, etc., although each track has an unofficial name used by the band.

Jónsi sang the lyrics of &quot;( )&quot; entirely in &quot;Vonlenska&quot; (&quot;Hopelandic&quot;), a made-up &quot;language&quot; which consists of meaningless words and syllables. Jónsi uses Hopelandic in place of songs which do not yet have lyrics, although some tracks on Sigur Rós albums &quot;Von&quot; and &quot;Takk...&quot; are only sung in the language. Its names in English and Icelandic are derived from &quot;Von&quot; (&quot;Hope&quot; in English), the ninth track on the album &quot;Von&quot;, which is the first instance in which Hopelandic is used in the band&#x27;s music. The Hopelandic of &quot;( )&quot; consists of one eleven-syllable phrase, with various permutations and subsequent variations thereof sung over the course of the album. &quot;( )&quot; is made up of material that Sigur Rós had been playing live for over two years. For this reason, the band did not want to give the songs actual lyrics. Drummer Orri Páll Dýrason said of this, &quot;[the songs] were fully formed and it would have been strange to suddenly insert lyrics into these finished products.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;Pitchfork&quot; placed &quot;( )&quot; 29th on its list of the fifty best albums of 2002, and 135th on its list of the top 200 albums of the 2000s (decade). The album also peaked at No. 51 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. A music video for &quot;Untitled #1&quot; directed by Floria Sigismondi was released in April 2003. The video depicts a dystopian future in which schoolchildren wearing gas masks are playing amidst black snow and a red sky. In November 2003, Sigismondi&#x27;s video was given the award for &quot;Best Video&quot; at the MTV Europe Music Awards in Edinburgh, UK.

==Critical reception==
&quot;( )&quot; received critical acclaim, holding a Metacritic score of 82/100 based on twenty reviews, which makes it the twenty-sixth highest-scored album of 2002 according to Metacritic. Daniel Becker of &quot;Dusted Magazine&quot; wrote that the album is &quot;gorgeous music..the songs are vast, unhurried, and vivid, and that only makes them more powerful.&quot; He considers &quot;( )&quot; a &quot;logical extension of &quot;Ágætis Byrjun&quot;, relying on the same interplay of instruments to create a similarly picturesque and eerily calm atmosphere.&quot; Chris Ott of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote that &quot;Sigur Rós&#x27; music has all the depth, resonance and humanity of a Brueghel landscape, and is best appreciated at loud volumes in open spaces, as a soundtrack for scenery, real or imagined.&quot; Sean Adams of &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; said that &quot;&quot;( )&quot; is as pioneering, unnerving, inspiring, confusing, as lyrically anarchic as every thing that has moved the world, ever&quot; and &quot;why I love music, why this website has this name and why art exists. &quot;( )&quot; [is] yours to discover.&quot; Gavin Mueller of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; found that Jónsi&#x27;s voice &quot;never [has] sounded more exposed, giving [the band] a strength that &quot;Ágætis Byrjun&quot; often obscured. The final track&#x27;s ultimate climax is nothing short of harrowing, as a crashing storm of frantic drum fills overwhelms Birgisson&#x27;s urgent guitar strumming and plaintive wail.&quot;

Andy Kellman of AllMusic said that with &quot;( )&quot;, Sigur Rós made &quot;only adjustments – no significant developments – in the group&#x27;s sound&quot; and that &quot;The fact that the emotional extremes are few and far between makes the album difficult to wade through&quot;. Ott wrote that &quot;( )&quot; &quot;doesn&#x27;t shine with the same nascent glimmer as its predecessor. If the band weren&#x27;t so headstrong, it wouldn&#x27;t even be a consideration, but from the beginning they&#x27;ve claimed they would change music forever, and that this record in particular would be even better than [&quot;Ágætis byrjun&quot;]&quot;. In addition, he found the album&#x27;s main Hopelandic phrase repetitive, and that &quot;( )&quot; lacked the innovation of its predecessor. Gavin Edwards of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called &quot;( )&quot; &quot;impressive&quot; but &quot;remarkably similar&quot; in sound; &quot;it&#x27;s just packaged more pretentiously.&quot; Ott said of the blank booklet included with &quot;( )&quot;, &quot;I fail to see how this tactic enriches the band&#x27;s cinematic balladry&quot;, adding, &quot;evidence that they just thought it would be cool to package the record this way is abundant&quot;. Mueller called the title of &quot;( )&quot; &quot;forehead-slappingly pretentious&quot;, and considered the album&#x27;s nameless tracks &quot;a jab at Yorke-worshippers who couldn&#x27;t pronounce the Icelandic titles of Sigur Ros&#x27;s previous work anyway.&quot; In his review for &quot;PopMatters&quot;, music critic Matt Cibula wrote, &quot;I don&#x27;t think there &quot;are&quot; any real meanings to these songs, other than the ones we bring to them, each on our own&quot;, adding:

My only clue – and here I&#x27;m cheating massively – is that I saw them in concert a month ago, and these songs were invariably accompanied by hazy images of children, of childhood ... but even if this stuff is about the end of childhood or innocence or any of those trotted-out tropes, I wouldn&#x27;t know, and it probably tells you more about me than the opening section of this record.A book on the album was released in the 33⅓ series on 28 August 2014. The series are short books inspired by or focused on albums and are generally written as longform essays. The book, written by composer Ethan Hayden, was cited by &quot;Pitchfork&quot; as one of the &quot;33 Best Books&quot;.

===Media usage===
A snippet from &quot;Untitled #8&quot; can be heard during the trailer for the Oliver Hirschbiegel film &quot;The Invasion&quot; (2007).
&quot;Untitled #7&quot; is featured in the trailer for the 2008 video game &quot;Dead Space&quot;.
&quot;Untitled #4&quot;, as well as &quot;Svefn-g-englar&quot; and the title track from and a video backdrop used during a Sigur Rós concert in Los Angeles, are featured in the film &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; (2001). This was the first case of the band licensing their music for a movie; Jónsi allowed for it in part &quot;because he thought the idea of Tom Cruise acting over their music was &#x27;funny&#x27;&quot;.
&quot;Untitled #4&quot; was played in the American TV series &quot;Queer as Folk&quot;, as well as the season 3 finale of Canadian TV series &quot;Orphan Black&quot; (2015).
&quot;Untitled #3&quot;, listed as its alternate title &quot;Samskeyti&quot;, was used in the credits for the Gregg Araki-directed film &quot;Mysterious Skin&quot; (2004, based on the 1995 novel by Scott Heim),
in an episode from the second season of the British serial drama &quot;Skins&quot; (2008), in the 2009 film &quot;The Boys Are Back&quot; (directed by Scott Hicks and starring Clive Owen) during the final shots, and in the 2020 film &quot;Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga&quot;. Various tracks off &quot;( )&quot; were used in the American crime drama &quot;&quot;. &quot;Vaka&quot; was also heavily used in the soundtrack to the 2010 Norwegian film &quot;King of Devil&#x27;s Island&quot;.
The 2006 Academy Award-nominated Danish film &quot;After the Wedding&quot; also uses &quot;Untitled #1&quot; (&quot;Vaka&quot;) as background music during the funeral of a major character. Multiple songs from the album are incorporated into the soundtrack for the 2024 video game &quot;,&quot; based on the popular Moomin series.

<doc id="228531" wikidata="Q249952" url="?curid=228531" title="Ágætis byrjun">
<text> (, &quot;A good beginning&quot;) is the second studio album by Icelandic post-rock band Sigur Rós, released on 12 June 1999. The album was recorded between the summer of 1998 and the spring of 1999 with producer Ken Thomas. represented a substantial departure from the band&#x27;s previous album &quot;Von&quot;, with that album&#x27;s extended ambient soundscapes replaced by Jónsi Birgisson&#x27;s cello-bowed guitar work and orchestration, using a double string octet amongst other chamber elements.

 was a commercial and critical breakthrough for the band. It received a 2000 release in the United Kingdom and a 2001 release in the United States. According to their label Smekkleysa, the album sold 10,000 copies on its first year of release in Iceland, earning the band platinum status. It won numerous awards, and has appeared on multiple critics&#x27; lists of the best albums of the 2000s.

 is the band&#x27;s first album to feature keyboardist Kjartan Sveinsson, and their last to feature drummer Ágúst Ævar Gunnarsson, who left the band several months after the album was released. Gunnarsson was replaced by Orri Páll Dýrason in the same year.

==Composition==

The ten songs on the album include some self-reference; the introduction contains backmasked sections of the title track, and the last song, &quot;Avalon&quot;, consists of a different take of an instrumental passage from &quot;Starálfur&quot; slowed to around a quarter of its original speed. The string parts on &quot;Starálfur&quot; are palindromic; they are the same forwards and backwards.

All vocals are sung in Icelandic, except for those on &quot;Olsen Olsen&quot; and the last section of the title track, which are sung in the gibberish language Vonlenska. Sigur Rós&#x27; subsequent album, &quot;( )&quot;, used Vonlenska exclusively for its vocals.

The album has been described as &quot;cosmic&quot;, &quot;other-worldly&quot; and &quot;timeless&quot; due to the unique sound of the band&#x27;s music. 

==Packaging==
The album&#x27;s title came from a friend hearing the first song they had written for the album, which would become the title track. After hearing the song, he said it was &quot;a good beginning&quot;; the name stuck. The title has also been translated as &quot;An alright start.&quot;

The sketch of a human foetus on the cover was drawn by Gotti Bernhöft with a Bic Cristal ballpoint pen. The booklet cover for the CD edition of the album features the line: &quot;Ég gaf ykkur von sem varð að vonbrigðum... þetta er ágætis byrjun&quot; which translates to &quot;I gave you (plural) hope that became a disappointment... this is a good beginning&quot;. This line is a reference to their two previous releases, &quot;Von&quot; and &quot;Von brigði&quot;.

Sigur Rós assembled and glued together the cases of the first print of themselves. As a result, many of the CDs were unusable due to glue stains.

==Reception==

While released to little fanfare, the album quickly gained radio exposure in Iceland, and spent the autumn of 1999 climbing the Icelandic album charts, finally resting at the top for a number of weeks. After surprising success in Iceland, the album subsequently gained strong international buzz with numerous articles in many prominent publications, hype from internet message boards and blogs, as well as often exuberant critical praise. was released in the United Kingdom in 2000, and in the North American market in 2001 by Fat Cat Records. In 2001, won the inaugural Shortlist Music Prize.

An acclaimed music video was made for &quot;Viðrar vel til loftárása&quot;. The album&#x27;s tracks have also been featured in soundtracks; &quot;Starálfur&quot; was used in &quot;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou&quot; and the Emmy winning 2005 TV film &quot;The Girl in the Café&quot;. &quot;Svefn-g-englar&quot; was used in &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot;, amongst others. The song &quot;Flugufrelsarinn&quot; has been arranged by Stephen Prustman for the Kronos Quartet, and is available on their download-only release &quot;Kronos Quartet Plays Sigur Rós&quot;.

&quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked at number two on their list of the best albums of 2000 (behind &quot;Kid A&quot; by Radiohead), and at number eight on their list of the top 200 albums of the 2000s.

In December 2009, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the 29th best album of the 2000s.

In the &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;Mojo&quot; Classic Special Edition &quot;Pink Floyd &amp; The Story of Prog Rock&quot;, the album placed at number 27 in its list of &quot;40 Cosmic Rock Albums&quot;.

The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

It was announced in 2009 that a deluxe edition would be released to mark the 10th anniversary of ″s international release. It was slated for release in early summer 2015. It was to feature previously unheard studio and live recordings as well as photographic and documentary material from the band&#x27;s personal archives.

 peaked at No. 24 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Independent Albums chart in January and it has sold 227,000 copies in the US, according to Nielsen SoundScan. In Europe it was upgraded to Platinum by Impala award for 400,000+ copies sold up to 2012.

&quot;Olsen Olsen&quot; was used in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;The Saga of Carl&quot; broadcast May 19, 2013.

Note

<doc id="228532" wikidata="Q1933433" url="?curid=228532" title="Swansong (album)">
<text>Swansong is the fifth studio album by English extreme metal band Carcass. It was released on 10 June 1996 in the UK by Earache Records. It is the only Carcass album to feature guitarist Carlo Regadas. This album was intended to be their major label debut, having been signed by Columbia Records following the success of &quot;Heartwork&quot;, but disputes with that record company caused them to return to Earache. The album was re-released on 21 July 2008, as a dualdisc including the fifth part of &quot;The Pathologist&#x27;s Report&quot;. It was the band&#x27;s last studio release for over 17 years, until the release of &quot;Surgical Steel&quot; in 2013, and the last to feature founding member Ken Owen on drums, although he contributed backing vocals to &quot;Surgical Steel&quot;.

==Background==
In &quot;The Pathologist&#x27;s Report&quot;, drummer Ken Owen states that he considers &quot;Swansong&quot; the ultimate Carcass album. The band&#x27;s sense of humour is illustrated with titles such as &quot;Keep on Rotting in the Free World&quot;.

The disc art is the &quot;Unfinished Pyramid et al.&quot; from the Great Seal of the United States, but it reads &quot;carcass&quot; instead of &quot;annuit coeptis&quot;, &quot;somnus pecunia cibus&quot; instead of &quot;novus ordo seclorum&quot; and &quot;MCMXCV&quot; instead of &quot;MDCCLXXVI&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Swansong&quot; was released on 10 June 1996 on Earache Records. A limited edition of this album was released as a brain-shaped CD, with a bonus 2-track CD titled &quot;Somnus Pecunia Cibus&quot;. The reason for the bonus disc was to include &quot;Go to Hell&quot;, which wouldn&#x27;t fit on the brain shaped CD, due to the cutting required for the brain shape.

On 21 July 2008, a twelve-panel digipak version of the album was released, with full artwork and lyrics as well as a limited edition sticker sheet with classic Carcass motifs. The reissue also features the previously Japanese-only bonus track &quot;Death Rider Da&quot; which was made to be used as a jingle on a Japanese critic Masa Ito&#x27;s radio program at the time, as well as the fifth and final part of the extensive interview &quot;The Pathologist&#x27;s Report&quot; on a dualdisc. Later editions contain the album on a CD and the documentary on a separate DVD, and do not include the sticker sheet.

In November 2013, Earache rereleased &quot;Swansong&quot; on full dynamic range vinyl in different colours and with limited circulation.

<doc id="228533" wikidata="Q1592490" url="?curid=228533" title="Heartwork">
<text>Heartwork is the fourth studio album by English extreme metal band Carcass. The album was released in the UK by Earache Records on 18 October 1993, and in the United States on 11 January 1994 by Columbia Records, making it the band&#x27;s only major label release. &quot;Heartwork&quot; has been described as the band&#x27;s &quot;breakthrough&quot; and &quot;mid-period masterpiece&quot;, as well as a landmark album in melodic death metal. The album was recorded at Parr Street Studios, Liverpool from 18 May – 21 June 1993.

The sculpture depicted in the cover art, &quot;Life Support 1993,&quot; was designed by H. R. Giger, and is an update of a sculpture he created in the late 1960s. The video for the title track features a real-life interpretation of the sculpture, including a human welded as a part of it. The album was reissued as a Dualdisc on 2 June 2008.

Until 2021&#x27;s &quot;Torn Arteries&quot;, this was the only Carcass album to have the same lineup as the previous album. Guitarist Michael Amott left the band after the recording of the album before founding Spiritual Beggars, and was temporarily replaced by Mike Hickey. In &quot;The Pathologist&#x27;s Report,&quot; Bill Steer says &quot;Heartwork&quot; is his favourite Carcass album.

== Composition and lyrics ==
&quot;Heartwork&quot; has been noted for its strong sense of melody. According to Johnny Loftus of AllMusic, the music on the album &quot; melody onto the existing muscle of Carcass&#x27; punishing .&quot; The album&#x27;s sound has been described as &quot;relentless.&quot; The album&#x27;s guitar riffs have been described as &quot;intricate.&quot; The album contains influences from the New Wave of British Heavy Metal. The album&#x27;s sound has been described as &quot;Megadeth being flushed down a toilet.&quot; Invisible Oranges described the album&#x27;s sound as &quot;cold and massive.&quot; The album has described as &quot;catchy&quot; and as &quot;a continuous onslaught of memorable hooks.&quot; While the lyrical content on earlier Carcass releases has been described as &quot;ridiculous medical dictionary-isms,&quot; the lyrics on &quot;Heartwork&quot; have been described as &quot;abstract.&quot; Ken Owen&#x27;s drumming has been called &quot;curiously wobbly.&quot;
==Release==
&quot;Heartwork&quot; sold at least 81,000 units. It spawned one single under the same name that featured the title track and non-album tracks &quot;This is Your Life&quot; and &quot;Rot &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;.

The album was re-released in 2008 as part of an ongoing series of Carcass reissues to tie in with their reunion. The main album is presented as one side of a Dualdisc, while the DVD side features the fourth part of an extended interview/documentary titled &quot;The Pathologist&#x27;s Report Part IV: Epidemic.&quot; Also included in the reissue is a bonus disc including the entire album in demo form, something recorded by the band before recording the actual album in an effort to be better prepared. The demo features the same 10 songs in a slightly different order. Later editions have the DVD on a separate disc, bringing the total to 3 discs. The album is presented in a 12-panel digipak with full lyrics and artwork.

==Critical reception and legacy==

&quot;Heartwork&quot; is considered by some to be the best British extreme metal album of the 1990s, and is widely considered to be one of the greatest death metal albums of all time. In an October 2007 interview, Evile frontman Matt Drake described &quot;Heartwork&quot; as &quot;just one of the best albums ever.&quot; Metal Hammer said the album was &quot;arguably the point where melodic death metal became a cohesive idea,&quot; calling it the genre&#x27;s &quot;defining statement.&quot;

Hank Schteamer of Pitchfork described &quot;Heartwork&quot; as Carcass&#x27;s &quot;mid-period masterpiece,&quot; and praised the album as being &quot;perhaps the greatest example to date of an extreme-metal band nodding to the polish and swagger of above-ground rock while retaining their core ferocity.&quot; Johnny Loftus called the album the band&#x27;s &quot;breakthrough release&quot; on AllMusic, and suggested that while &quot;some purists might decry its melodic breaks for soloing or nods toward conventional structure[,] &quot;Heartwork&quot; is that rare album that so carefully dissects and reconstructs its original form that its additional body parts seem like they were there all along.&quot;

&quot;Decibel&quot; called &quot;Heartwork&quot; &quot;a thing of pure metal glory&quot; and a landmark in death metal, crediting the band&#x27;s innovations for taking the genre to &quot;new places.&quot;

In May 2013, &quot;Heartwork&quot; was inducted into the Decibel Magazine Hall of Fame, becoming the 100th overall inductee and second Carcass album to be featured in the Decibel Hall of Fame, right after &quot;Necroticism&quot;.

In 2017, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Heartwork&quot; as 51st on their list of &#x27;The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time.&#x27;

The band Carnal Forge named themselves after the song of the same name from this album. Additionally, the album&#x27;s influence has been observed in the works of Arsis, The Black Dahlia Murder, Arch Enemy and Angela Gossow.&quot;

The album&#x27;s first track &quot;Buried Dreams&quot; has been called &quot;one of the mightiest [opening tracks] any record has ever had.&quot;

<doc id="228539" wikidata="Q655455" url="?curid=228539" title="Necroticism – Descanting the Insalubrious">
<text>Necroticism – Descanting the Insalubrious is the third album by British extreme metal band Carcass. It was released on 30 October 1991 through Earache Records. This album is the first to feature guitarist Michael Amott and marked the first time Carcass had recorded as a four-piece. Many of the tracks describe economical ways to dispose of dead bodies. &quot;Necroticism&quot; continues the move towards a predominant death metal sound which was started in &quot;Symphonies of Sickness&quot;, featuring songs with longer sections and complex structures, more akin to the then-burgeoning technical death metal subgenre.

== Release ==
&quot;Necroticism&quot; was originally released on 21 October 1991 through Earache Records. The album was re-released in 2008 as part of an ongoing series of Carcass reissues, to tie in with their reunion. The main album is presented as one side of a dualdisc, while the DVD side features the third part of an extended documentary titled &quot;The Pathologist&#x27;s Report Part III: Mass Infection&quot;, and a 23-minute interview with Walker and Amott from 1993, recorded on the Gods of Grind tour. Later editions of the reissue contain the album on a CD and the documentary on a separate DVD. Also included in the reissue is a set of four art cards. The reissue is presented in a 12-panel digipak with full lyrics and artwork.

== Musical style ==
Ken Owen and Jeff Walker said during &quot;The Pathologist&#x27;s Report Part III: Mass Infection&quot; that they rejected the descriptions of Carcass&#x27;s music on this album being grindcore. While Owen acknowledges its death metal characteristics, both he and Walker expressed that they are more inclined towards calling their music on this album &quot;progressive&quot;. Music journalist T Coles described the album as having &quot;a more straightforward death metal sound&quot;.

== Reception ==
AllMusic gave &quot;Necroticism&quot; four out of five stars, stating that the worthy addition of Michael Amott made the record an excellent guitarist&#x27;s album. Kerrang! notably gave the album a perfect score in their 364th magazine issue. Metal Storm gave &quot;Necroticism&quot; a 9.6/10 calling it a masterpiece and a transitional album that every metalhead should own (melodic or extreme) and suggested that people should buy the album immediately.

=== Accolades ===
In 2005, &quot;Necroticism&quot; was ranked number 294 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book of &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. In September 2005, &quot;Necroticism&quot; was inducted into the Decibel Magazine Hall of Fame, being the eighth album overall to be featured in the Decibel Hall of Fame.

<doc id="228540" wikidata="Q227031" url="?curid=228540" title="360-degree feedback">
<text>360-degree feedback (also known as multi-rater feedback, multi-source feedback, or multi-source assessment) is a process through which feedback from an employee&#x27;s colleagues and associates is gathered, in addition to a self-evaluation by the employee.

360-degree feedback can include input from external sources who interact with the employee (such as customers and suppliers), subordinates, peers, and supervisors. It differs from traditional performance appraisal, which typically uses &quot;downward feedback&quot; delivered by supervisors employees, and &quot;upward feedback&quot; delivered to managers by subordinates.

Organizations most commonly use 360-degree feedback for developmental purposes. Nonetheless, organizations are increasingly using 360-degree feedback in performance evaluations and administrative decisions, such as in payroll and promotion. When 360-degree feedback is used for performance evaluation purposes, it is sometimes called a 360-degree review. The use of 360-degree feedback in evaluation is controversial, due to concerns about the subjectivity and fairness of feedback providers.

==History==
The origins of 360-degree feedback date back to around 1930, with the German Reichswehr, when the military psychologist Johann Baptist Rieffert developed a selection methodology for officer candidates. One of the earliest recorded uses of surveys to gather information about employees occurred in the 1950s at the Esso Research and Engineering Company. From there, the idea of 360-degree feedback gained momentum. 

Online evaluation tools led to increased popularity of multi-rater feedback assessments, due to the ease of use compared to physical pen-and-paper tools. The outsourcing of human resources functions has also created a market for 360-degree feedback products from consultants. Today, studies suggest that over one-third of U.S. companies use some type of multi-source feedback, including 90% of all Fortune 500 firms. In recent years, multi-source feedback has become a best practice in human resources due to online tools such as multiple language options, comparative reporting, and aggregate reporting.

== Guidelines ==
Certain guidelines emphasise establishing trust between raters and ratees to improve rater accountability and feedback accuracy. At the same time, anonymous participation has also been found to result in more accurate feedback, in which case confidentiality among human resources staff and managers should be preserved. The standardisation and optimisation of rating scales and data collection also affects assessment accuracy, including such factors like the time of day.

== Issues ==
Using 360-degree feedback tools for appraisal purposes has been criticised over concerns of performance criteria validity, ability of peers to give accurate feedback, and manipulation of these systems by feedback providers. Employee manipulation of feedback ratings has been reported in some companies who have utilized 360-degree feedback for performance evaluation, including GE, IBM, and Amazon.

The amount and level of training in 360-degree feedback for both the rater and ratee can affect the level of accuracy of the feedback. If no guidance is given, individual bias may affect the rater&#x27;s ratings and the ratee&#x27;s interpretation of the feedback. However, even with training measures in place, unconscious bias may still occur due to factors such as the cultural influences or relationship quality between the rater and ratee. Additionally, if there are potential consequences from rater feedback, rater motivation may shift from providing accurate feedback to providing feedback based on self-motivated reasons such as promoting or harming a particular individual.

Some members of the U.S. military have criticized its use of 360-degree feedback programs in employment decisions because of problems with validity and reliability. Other branches of the U.S. government have questioned 360-degree feedback reviews as well. Still, these organizations continue to use and develop their assessments in developmental processes.

A study on the patterns of rater accuracy shows that the length of time that a rater has known the individual being evaluated generally correlates with positive review favorability and lower accuracy of a 360-degree review, apart from raters who have known the individual for less than a year.

It has been suggested that multi-rater assessments often generate conflicting opinions and that there may be no way to determine whose feedback is accurate. Studies have also indicated that self-ratings are generally significantly higher than the ratings given from others.

==Results==
Several studies indicate that the use of 360-degree feedback helps to improve employee performance because it helps the evaluated see different perspectives of their performance.

In a 5-year study, no improvement in overall rater scores was found from the 1st year to the 2nd, but scores rose with each passing year from 2nd to 4th. A 1996 study found that performance increased between the 1st and 2nd administrations, and sustained this improvement 2 years later. Additional studies show that 360-degree feedback may be predictive of future performance.

Some authors maintain, however, that there are too many confounding variables related to 360-degree evaluations to reliably generalize their effectiveness, arguing that process features are likely to have major effects on creating behavior change. A 1998 study has found that the category of rater affects the reliability of feedback, with direct reports generally the least reliable.

Multiple pieces of research have demonstrated that the scale of responses can have a major effect on the results, and that some response scales are better than others. The evaluated individual following up with raters to discuss their results, which cannot be done when feedback is anonymous, often has a profound impact on results. Other potentially powerful factors affecting behavior change include how raters are selected, manager approval, instrument quality, rater training and orientation, participant training, supervisor training, coaching, integration with HR systems, and accountability.

One group of studies proposed four paradoxes that explain why 360-degree evaluations do not elicit accurate data: 

# The Paradox of Roles, in which an evaluator is conflicted by being both peer and the judge
# The Paradox of Group Performance, which admits that the vast majority of work done in a corporate setting is done in groups, not individually
# The Measurement Paradox, which shows that qualitative, or in-person, techniques are much more effective than mere ratings in facilitating change
# The Paradox of Rewards, which shows that individuals evaluating their peers care more about the rewards associated with finishing the task than the actual content of the evaluation itself.

Additional studies found no correlation between an employee&#x27;s multi-rater assessment scores and performance appraisal scores provided by supervisors. They advise that although multi-rater feedback can be effectively used for appraisal, care needs to be taken in its implementation or results will be compromised. This research suggests that 360-degree feedback and performance appraisals get at different outcome, leading some executives to argue that traditional performance appraisals and 360-degree feedback should be used in evaluating overall performance.

<text>Chocolate-coated marshmallow treats, also known as chocolate teacakes, are confections consisting of a biscuit base topped with marshmallow-like filling and then coated in a hard shell of chocolate. They were invented in Denmark in the 19th century under the name (cream buns), and later also produced and distributed by Viau in Montreal as early as 1901. Numerous varieties exist, with regional variations in recipes. Some variants of these confections have previously been known in many countries by names comprising equivalents of the English word &quot;negro&quot;.

== National varieties ==

=== North America ===

==== Canada ====

Whippets are produced in Cambridge, Ontario, Canada, by Dare Foods. Théophile Viau first manufactured these as &quot;Empire&quot; biscuits in Montreal, and introduced them at a hockey game in Westmount in 1901, but in 1927, in order to lower costs, he removed the vanilla and renamed the product &quot;Whippets&quot;. They are currently available with both dark chocolate and milk chocolate coatings, and twelve varieties of flavors.

&quot;Viva Puffs&quot; are similar to Whippets; they are produced by Dare Foods in two flavours. Viva is a trade name; these confections have been known in Canada for at least 50 years as &quot;chocolate puffs&quot;.

The cookies are similar to Mallomars of New York City. They also bear a striking resemblance to Tunnock&#x27;s Tea Cakes as well as Krembos. However, the Tunnock tea cake does not have the same kind of chocolate nor filling.

An episode of the Canadian science program &quot;How It&#x27;s Made&quot; showed the production process behind the cookie. However, many aspects of the production process (the amount of marshmallow filling, the ingredients, etc.) were not revealed. The show&#x27;s narrator described these aspects as &quot;classified information&quot;.

==== United States ====
In the United States, Mallomars are produced by Nabisco. A graham cracker circle is overlaid with extruded marshmallow, then coated in a thin shell of dark chocolate. Mallomars were introduced to the public in 1913, the same year as the Moon Pie (a confection that has similar ingredients). The first box of Mallomars was sold in West Hoboken, New Jersey (now Union City, New Jersey).

Mallomars are generally available from early October through to April. They are not distributed during the summer months, supposedly because they melt easily in summer temperatures, though this is as much for marketing reasons as for practical ones. Devoted eaters of the cookie have been known to stock up during winter months and keep them refrigerated over the summer, although Nabisco markets other chocolate-coated cookie brands year-round. (Those brands include Pinwheels, which also combines chocolate, cookie, and marshmallow.) Eighty-five percent of all Mallomars are sold in the New York metropolitan area. They are produced entirely within Canada, at a factory in Scarborough, Ontario.

=== Northern and Western Europe ===

==== Austria ====
The Austrian version of chocolate-coated egg white foam is called . It was created in 1926 by Walter Niemetz who chose the name in honour of a friend of Swedish origin who had a hand in the development. Manufacturing started in 1930. Schwedenbomben were originally only sold at six per pack, but are now also available in packs of twelve and twenty. Regardless of the pack size, half the pieces in a pack are plain and the other half are sprinkled with coconut flakes.

Schwedenbomben are immensely popular in Austria. They have a market share of around 80% and a brand recognition of about 94%.

==== Denmark ====
In Denmark, the treat was originally made using cream (hence the Danish name —&quot;cream buns&quot;); however, the filling was later made from egg whites to help industrialize production and improve shelf life. In Denmark, the confection is known as a &quot;flødebolle&quot; (cream bun) and was in some parts, mostly in the Copenhagen area of Denmark, historically known as a &quot;negerbolle&quot; (negro bun) or &quot;negerkys&quot; (negro kiss). In the 1960s through 1980s, the term negro was phased out by all major producers due to its use as a racial slur. Denmark also markets a variation shaped more like a patty, hence the name &quot;bøf&quot; (steak). Note that the Swedish word &quot;negerboll&quot; is used for a similar but different confection (Havregrynskugle aka chokladboll).

Denmark is one of the largest producers of chocolate-coated marshmallow treats, producing approximately 800 million of these every year. The largest Danish producer, Elvirasminde, produces roughly 650 million treats; the company sends 400 million abroad and leaving the remaining 250 million to be eaten by the Danish population, putting the amount of &quot;flødeboller&quot; eaten at 45 per Dane per year.

In Denmark, chocolate-coated marshmallow treats are traditionally handed out in school by children on their birthday. They are found in any supermarket, and most confectioners will have delicacy versions. It is also a popular addition to ice cream cones, offered at most shops selling ice cream. Usually they are placed on top of the last ball of ice cream with whipped cream and jam (or &quot;Guf&quot;, a topping made of whipped egg whites with sugar and fruit flavoring) Sometimes they are even found in restaurants. Many baking enthusiasts see them as a challenge, and it was a technical challenge in &quot;Den store Bagedyst&quot; (The Great Bake Off) on Danish TV.

The popularity of the treat is evident from the sheer number of varieties. Variation in coating ranging from white chocolate over dark chocolate to licorice coating, with or without sprinkles. The base is often a plain wafer in commercial products, but delicacy and homemade versions often have shortbread, marzipan biscuits or other bases. Flavored filling is also very common especially when homemade, but licorice, marzipan and other flavors are commercially available. Variation in form is also common, often this is seen in commercial products ranging from wide and flat (bøf) to tall with sharp edges (Christmas tree).

Luxury versions have become more popular, and has also made the image of the &#x27;flødebolle&#x27; change from a basic candy or cake, to a luxury product suitable as a dessert or present, similar to a box of high-quality chocolates.

==== Belgium ====
In Belgium, Milka branded it under the name &quot;Melo-Cakes&quot;. These popular treats are sold in packages of six to thirty pieces.

In Flanders, the confection is known as &quot;negerinnentetten&quot;. The word can either be translated as &quot;negress&#x27;s tits&quot; or could originate from the French word for head, , as the French word for this confection used to be , which is French for &quot;negro&#x27;s head&quot;. This is also the probable origin of an alternative name &quot;negertetten&quot;. Nowadays manufacturers market the confection under a different name, as the aforementioned terms are considered to be offensive.

==== Germany ====

In Germany, the (; &quot;Choco-kiss&quot;) was first made commercially in 1920, although the first mention of them dates to 1892. Industrial manufacturing started in the 1950s. The sweets are made all year long, with approximately one billion made per year, placing average consumption at about one dozen per person per year. They are available in supermarkets and bakeries, and are traditionally sold at fairs. The interior is always egg white foam, sweetened with sugar, but there are also varieties using sugar substitutes available on the German market.

Sometimes they are consumed pressed between two halves of a bun, which is also referred to as a (&quot;Mud Roll&quot; or &quot;Squished Bread Roll&quot;)mostly by children.

The original colloquial names were (&quot;Moor&#x27;s Head&quot;) and (&quot;Negro&#x27;s Kiss&quot;), but after eventually accepting that these names are racist and therefore inappropriate, companies changed the product-name to (&quot;Chocolate Kisses&quot;), (&quot;Foam Kisses&quot;) or to brand-specific names like Dickmann&#x27;s.

==== Switzerland ====
In German-speaking Switzerland, they are still sold as . In the French-speaking part of Switzerland, as well as in France, they are known as Têtes Choco (&quot;chocolate heads&quot;); they are more commonly referred as in France, which is also a racial slur.

==== Great Britain ====

These differ from the domed biscuit or wafer based styles and contain a higher proportion of thicker rippled chocolate, topped with a half walnut.

===== Scotland =====
In the United Kingdom, this confection is known as a chocolate teacake; however, the confection is entirely unlike the usual English teacake, a sweet roll with dried fruit which is served toasted and buttered. Teacakes are generally served in the afternoon alongside a traditional British tea. There are several manufacturers of chocolate teacakes in the UK, though the best known is Tunnock&#x27;s, a Scottish company founded in 1890. It was invented by Sir Boyd Tunnock in 1956. He developed the idea of using Italian meringue. He made a biscuit base, hand piped the mallow onto the base and covered it in milk chocolate. The Tunnock&#x27;s teacake is commonly regarded in the same food category as the British biscuit, eaten at break times with a cup of tea as shown in advertising for the product. Popular throughout the UK, the Tunnock&#x27;s Teacake enjoys iconic status in Scotland, evoking memories of childhood, or symbolising &quot;home&quot; for Scots around the world.

The Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service gives Tunnock&#x27;s Teacakes to blood donors in Scotland after giving blood. There is an online appreciation society for the Tunnock&#x27;s Teacake and Dundee University also has an appreciation society for the Tunnock&#x27;s Teacake. A giant fully edible replica of a Tunnock&#x27;s Teacake was made by Michelle Kershaw and Nick Dodds at &quot;Pimp That Snack&quot;. The opening ceremony of the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow featured giant dancing Tunnock&#x27;s Teacakes.

The product itself consists of a small round shortbread base covered with a hemisphere of Italian meringue, a whipped egg white concoction similar to marshmallow. As this soft white fondant is based on egg white rather than gelatine, it is much more delicate than marshmallow. This also means that a Tunnock&#x27;s Teacake is suitable for vegetarians, unlike any marshmallow-based alternatives. The Italian meringue is then coated in a thin layer of milk or plain chocolate and, in the case of Tunnock&#x27;s, wrapped in a distinctive red and silver foil for the more popular milk chocolate variety, and a blue and gold wrapping for the plain chocolate type. Several competing brands to Tunnock&#x27;s, such as Lees&#x27; Foods, also include jam in the centre of the teacake. In 2013, British café chain Costa Coffee introduced the giant marshmallow teacake, which is around three times the size of a standard teacake, with a chocolate biscuit base topped with marshmallow and raspberry jam in the centre.

An argument about whether the teacake is a biscuit or a cake led to an action in the European Court of Justice by British company Marks and Spencer. The UK tax authorities eventually accepted the company&#x27;s argument that the teacakes were cakes (chocolate covered biscuits are taxed, cakes are not) but refused to repay most of the VAT. The European court ruled that in principle the tax should be repaid and in a further hearing before the UK Law Lords in 2009, after 13 years of litigation, Marks and Spencer won full repayment of the tax they had paid from 1973 to 1994, amounting to £3.5 million. This case was fought with Jaffa cakes.

==== Netherlands ====
In the Netherlands, it was referred &quot;Negerzoenen&quot; (&quot;Negro kisses&quot;) until 2006. In 2005, the &quot;Foundation for Honor and Reparation of Payments for Victims of Slavery in Suriname&quot; fought to change the name, which happened shortly after. One of the largest producers changed the name to &quot;Zoenen&quot; (&quot;Kisses&quot;) and others followed. This led to some controversy, since the Dutch word &quot;neger&quot; was perceived by some as more neutral compared to the English equivalent &quot;negro&quot;, though both terms are now widely considered pejorative and racist. These are often packaged with nine per box, creating the play on words &quot;Negen Zoenen&quot; (&quot;Nine Kisses&quot;).

==== Finland ====

In Finland, the name originated from Germany, and they were named &quot;Negro&#x27;s Kisses&quot; (&quot;neekerinsuukot&quot;) in 1951. The name was changed to &quot;Brunberg&#x27;s Kisses&quot; in 2001, after the manufacturer Brunberg from Porvoo; the name was changed for the same reasons as in Denmark, Germany, and other countries.

=== Eastern, Central and Southeastern Europe ===

==== Hungary ====
In Hungary, the product is called &quot;négercsók&quot; (&quot;Negro kiss&quot;) and was first introduced in 1980 by the New World Farming and Food Industry Co-operative Society (Hungarian: Újvilág Mezőgazdasági és Élelmiszeripari Szövetkezet) to great success. The production was based on a Danish example, with Danish machinery. Production gradually declined in the 1990s when local confectionaries and food factories had to face heavy competition from abroad.

==== Russia ====

Zefir (, may also be spelled &quot;zephyr&quot; or &quot;zephir&quot;) is made from fruit and berry purée with added sugar and whipped egg whites. It is commonly produced and sold in the countries of the former Soviet Union. The recipe is a merger of the traditional Russian pastila with French meringue. The name given after the Greek god of the light west wind Zephyr symbolizes its delicate airy consistency.

The consistency is similar to that of marshmallows, Schokokuss or krembo. The form typically resembles traditional meringue. However, in contrast to commercial meringue, it is never crisp. Both pure and chocolate-coated versions are widespread. In contrast to the other confectioneries of this type, it has no biscuit base.

==== Slovenia ====
In Slovenia, these confections are known as &quot;indijančki&quot; (literally &quot;little Indians&quot;). They are also known as &quot;zamorčki&quot; (&quot;little Negroes&quot;).

==== Slovakia ====
In Slovakia, these are known as Čierny Princ (literally &quot;Black Prince&quot;).

==== Poland ====
Warm ice cream () is a Polish dessert or confection that could be seen as their version of the chocolate-covered marshmallow treat.

==== Serbia ====
Produced in Serbia by Jaffa, it has a biscuit base and a soft mallow filling covered by a chocolate flavoured coating, and is very similar to the original Glasgow version.

=== Southeastern Asia ===

==== Philippines ====

In the Philippines, Fibisco has &quot;Choco Mallows&quot;. Likely to allow for a better shelf life in the tropical climate, its &quot;hard chocolate shell&quot; is actually a soft chocolate covering that does not completely melt at room temperature.

=== Southern Europe ===

==== Portugal ====
In Portugal, these confections are known as &quot;Bombocas&quot;. Sold by different brands, usually the supermarket ones. They are sold in three main flavors: meringue (white interior), strawberry (pink) and vanilla (yellow). They are being called &quot;Beijinhos&quot; in the last few years.

=== Latin America ===

==== Argentina ====
In Argentina, the confections were first commercialised in the 1970s and known as &quot;Angelito negro&quot; (Little Black Angel) and later, &quot;cremocoa&quot;. They were manufactured by Terrabusi and are no longer in production, as in the country only the Uruguayan &quot;ricarditos&quot; are available.

==== Bolivia ====
In Bolivia, Chocolates Condor is the traditional manufacturer of &quot;Beso de Negro&quot; (Negro Kiss). The confection is similar to the German Schokoküsse in its use of a sweetened egg white foam filling rather than a marshmallow-based filling. There have been attempts to introduce variations in flavor, but the &quot;classic&quot; version remains the most popular.

==== Peru ====
In Peru, the confections are known as &quot;Beso de Moza&quot; (Girl&#x27;s Kiss), sold by Nestlé. Currently there is a contest between strawberry and lucuma flavors to become permanent versions of the product.

==== Colombia ====
In Colombia and Ecuador, it is called &quot;Beso de Negra&quot; (Black Woman&#x27;s Kiss) or &quot;Chocmelo&quot;, a portmanteau of chocolate and &quot;masmelo&quot; (marshmallow). However, these last ones do not always have a cookie as its base.

In 2020, during the George Floyd protests, Nestlé announced it would rename the confectionary and remove the image on its packaging of a Black woman with bare shoulders and a colorful dress.

==== Brazil ====
In Brazil, the dessert is known as Nhá Benta. It is manufactured by the Kopenhagen chocolaterie. Other variants exist in Brazil. Examples include Cacau Show&#x27;s Montebello (does not contain the waffle base), and the one that popularised the international formula for the masses in Brazil, the Dan-Top. The cookies are sold in a variety of flavours, including coconut, lemon, passion fruit, caramel, boysenberry, tonka bean and coffee. It is also known as &quot;teta-de-nega&quot; (&quot;black woman&#x27;s tit&quot;).

==== Uruguay ====
In Uruguay, it is known as &quot;Ricardito&quot;; the confection is meringue covered in chocolate, and is manufactured by Ricard.

=== Oceania ===

==== Australia ====
Arnott&#x27;s Chocolate Royals are a chocolate coated-marshmallow treat of Australia, which are available in milk and dark chocolate varieties, and are similar in appearance to a Tunnock&#x27;s teacake. Unlike Tunnock&#x27;s, however, Royals have a thin layer of jam between the biscuit and marshmallow; they are also smaller in size compared to a Tunnock&#x27;s teacake.

Previously, there is a variation on the chocolate-coated marshmallow treats which are coated in desiccated coconut, sold by Betta Foods under the Eskimo Snowballs name, before it was discontinued. Similarly, such treats are sold through supermarkets, such as Coles under the name Snow Drops.

==== New Zealand ====
Since the 1960s, the New Zealand biscuit manufacturers Griffin&#x27;s have made MallowPuffs, a chocolate biscuit that is described as a &quot;light fluffy marshmallow sitting on top of a shortcake biscuit, covered in luxurious milk chocolate&quot;. The marshmallow in MallowPuffs tends to be more dense and rubbery than in some similar products (such as Tunnock&#x27;s chocolate teacakes). They come in a variety of flavours, including Cookies and Cream, Hokey Pokey, Toffee, Rocky Road, Double Chocolate and original chocolate. The slogan from a national advertising campaign for MallowPuffs, &quot;Have you done enough for a MallowPuff&quot;, became briefly popular in the 1990s.

=== Southern Africa ===

==== South Africa ====
In South Africa, a similar confection is Sweetie Pies, originally made by Cadbury&#x27;s; it is now produced by Beyers.

=== Middle East ===

==== Iran ====
In Iran, this is considered a popular treat for children. The local version is sold under several brands, all commonly called (; literally meaning &quot;winter ice cream&quot;).

==== Levantine countries ====
In Levantine countries such as Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, and Jordan, it has historically been called (; slave head), however it has since been renamed to &quot;Sambo&quot;. In Lebanon, a local variation went on sale in the 1950s under the name &quot;ras el abd&quot; (slave&#x27;s head) by Gandour; however, it has since been changed to &quot;Tarboush&quot; or &quot;Tarboosh&quot; (Fez) but continues to be referred to by the former name in public.

==== Israel ====


&quot;Krembo&quot; or &quot;Creambo&quot; (, a contraction meaning literally &quot;Cream-in-it&quot;), is the name of a chocolate-coated marshmallow treat that is popular in Israel, especially in the winter as an alternative to ice-cream. &quot;Krembo whipped snack&quot; consists of a round biscuit base (17% of total weight), topped with fluffy marshmallow creme-like foam (53%), coated in a thin layer of compound chocolate (about 30%) and wrapped in colorful, thin aluminum foil. Over time, different flavorings have been attempted for the foam by the different manufacturers, but the most popular have always predominantly been the vanilla flavoring and, to a lesser extent, the mocha flavoring. According to a study from 2003, funded by Strauss, Israel&#x27;s leading Krembo producer, 69% of Israelis prefer to eat Krembos from the top down (starting with the cream), and only 10% start with the biscuit at the bottom; the rest had no preference.

European chocolate-coated marshmallow treats were popular as homemade sweets in Mandate Palestine, where it was known as Kushi (, roughly Negro) and Rosh Kushi (, roughly &quot;Negro&#x27;s head&quot;) This name was borrowed from the names then used in Europe. It entered mass production in 1966. The first manufacturer, the Whitman Company, coined the name &quot;Krembo&quot;. In Hebrew, the word &quot;krembo&quot; is a combination of &quot;krem&quot; (cream) and &quot;bo&quot; (in it), and ever since only that name has been in use. A mocha flavour was introduced in 1967. In 1979, Whitman was acquired by Strauss which has the major part of the krembo market in Israel. During the 1980s and 1990s, smaller manufacturers introduced additional flavours such as banana and strawberry but failed to achieve a significant market share. Today Strauss controls 54% of the krembo market in Israel.

Krembos are a seasonal treat sold only four months a year, from October to February. Nevertheless, 50 million krembos are sold each year—an average of 9 per person. Krembos are exported to the United States and Canada, and sold mostly in kosher shops and import stores.

In 2005, Strauss signed an agreement with Unilever to export ice cream and krembos to the United States and Canada due to a demand for products of this type with strict Kosher certification. Under terms of the agreement, they may be sold only in kosher supermarkets and import shops. The distributor in North America is Dairy Delight, a subsidiary of Norman&#x27;s Dairy. In 2007, Nestlé introduced an ice cream variation of krembo called &quot;Lekbo&quot; (, &quot;lick inside&quot;).

The average krembo weighs and has 115 calories. According to the fine print on packing foil, per 100 g of krembo there are 419 calories, 3.2 g protein, 64 g carbohydrates (of which 54 g are sugars); 16.7% Fats (of which 13.9% are poly-saturated fatty acids, less than 0.5% are trans fatty acids) and 67 mg sodium.

==Other variations==

=== Chocolate-covered marshmallow ===
Chocolate-covered marshmallows or chocolate-dipped marshmallows are confections of marshmallow coated with chocolate, without a biscuit base. Varieties include chocolate fish and Bamsemums.

==== Chocolate fish ====

In New Zealand, a common chocolate-coated marshmallow treat is the chocolate fish. A fish-shaped delicacy, 12 to 20 centimeters (5 to 8 inches) in length, it is made of pink or white marshmallow covered in a thin layer of milk chocolate. The milk chocolate&#x27;s texture features scale-like ripples on the fish, created by the fish moving under a blower during production.

In Kiwi culture, the chocolate fish is a common immediate reward or prize for a small job done well (e.g. &quot;Give that kid a chocolate fish&quot;) so much so that a phrase suggesting a person be awarded one can be said regardless of availability of the treat (and either as a compliment or sarcastically).

==== Cups ====
Milk chocolate cups may be filled with marshmallow in products including Mallo Cup and Valomilk.

=== Chocolate marshmallow pies ===

Chocolate marshmallow pies differ from regular chocolate-coated marshmallow treats in that there is a cake- or cookie-like layer above as well as below the marshmallow filling – that is, the marshmallow filling is sandwiched between two layers of cake or cookie, the entirety then being enrobed in chocolate. Some local names for chocolate marshmallow pies are:
* &quot;Chocolate marshmallow pie&quot; (a generic term) in the United States (e.g., Little Debbie Chocolate Flavored Marshmallow Pies).
* &quot;Moon Pie&quot; (a brand name of Chattanooga Bakery) in the United States, particularly the Southern United States.
* &quot;Scooter Pie&quot; (a brand name of Burry&#x27;s) in the United States, particularly in the Northeastern United States.
* &quot;Choco pie&quot; (originally a brand name, now a common noun as a generic trademark), originally in South Korea but now also in Russia and other parts of East Asia, South Asia and Southeast Asia.
* &quot;Angel pie&quot; (a brand name of Morinaga) in Japan.
* &quot;Wagon Wheels&quot; (a brand name used by both Burton&#x27;s Biscuit and Dare Foods) in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and certain other countries.

<doc id="228543" wikidata="Q537491" url="?curid=228543" title="Westerburg">
<text>Westerburg () is a small town of roughly 6,000 inhabitants in the Westerwaldkreis in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. The town is named after the castle built on a hill above the medieval town centre (&quot;Burg&quot; is German for “castle”)

==Geography==

===Location===
The town lies in easternmost Rhineland-Palatinate, 4 km from the boundary with Hesse. It is the seat of the &quot;Verbandsgemeinde&quot; of Westerburg – a kind of collective municipality – which administers the town and 24 surrounding municipalities.

===Constituent communities===
The former &quot;Ortsgemeinden&quot; – communities belonging to a &quot;Verbandsgemeinde&quot; – of Gershasen, Wengenroth and Sainscheid belong to the town of Westerburg.

==History==
The earliest witnesses to human beings settling in what is now Westerburg are some urns that point to cremations performed here about 700 BC.

The earliest documentary mention of the constituent community of Wengenroth is dated 9 November 879 from the time when Gebhard, Count of the Lahngau donated holdings here to the St. Severus Monastery in Gemünden.

The first time that Westerburg was named in a document came in 1209 when Siegfried III of Runkel acquired Westerburg by marrying a countess from the House of Leiningen and thereafter began calling himself Siegfried von Runkel und von Westerburg. Two of his sons had bequests from him: Siegfried IV of Runkel, whose seat was in Westerburg, and Dietrich I of Runkel, whose seat was in Runkel. Family squabbles began about 1250 and under Siegfried&#x27;s grandsons led to a permanent rift between the houses of Westerburg and Runkel by 1288. Dietrich&#x27;s son Siegfried V of Runkel drove his cousin Heinrich out of Runkel, whereupon Siegfried, who was Siegfried IV&#x27;s son, began calling himself Heinrich I of Westerburg. There are express indications of settlement next to the castle for the first time in 1270.

On 7 July 1292, Westerburg was raised to town at the same time as Wetzlar by King Adolf of Nassau, who also granted both towns the same town rights. In 1303, a jurymen&#x27;s court (&quot;Schöffengericht&quot;) was approved in the town. Later these jurymen, whose number soon became fixed at eight, took turns serving as the town&#x27;s mayor. No later than 1304, there were individual fortification works. Later, the town was divided into the upper town (Oberflecken) within the ring of walls finished by 1400 and the unwalled lower town (Unterflecken). There are known to have been 20 Burgmann houses in the upper town, but only from documents; archaeology has yielded no confirmation. In 1514, the first townsman&#x27;s house (&quot;Bürgerhaus&quot;) is mentioned, and in 1560, a new building. In 1630, a prison is avouched.

In 1448 and 1534, great fires beset the town. After the unification of the County of Leiningen-Dagsburg with the Barony of Westerburg in 1467, Reinhard IV of Westerburg, who as of 1481 began calling himself Count Reinhard I at Leiningen-Westerburg, moved his seat to the County of Leiningen. Only as of 1557 was Westerburg once again a seat for sidelines of the once more sundering House of Leiningen or its family branch, Leiningen-Westerburg. Westerburg townsmen (&quot;Bürger&quot;) had at their disposal several privileges, in particular blood court jurisdiction (&quot;Halsgerichtsbarkeit&quot;) at their jurymen&#x27;s court. Moreover, taxation privileges and laying out economic estates about the town time and again put the townsmen at loggerheads with the lords of the day.

In 1806, Westerburg passed to the Duchy of Berg. After 1815, the town was assigned to the Duchy of Nassau. On 2 September 1814, the lower town burnt down, and likewise the upper town on 13 October 1819. As of 1866, Prussia held sway. From 1866 to 1885, Westerburg belonged to the &quot;Amt&quot; of Rennerod and thereby also to the newly formed district of Oberwesterwaldkreis, whose seat was in Bad Marienberg. District reform in 1885 brought Westerburg a broader administrative function once again as it became the seat of a like-named district, which was in force until 1932. In that year, the Oberwesterwaldkreis was newly founded and Westerburg became its seat. In 1974, however, the two districts of Oberwesterwaldkreis and Unterwesterwaldkreis were amalgamated, and since then, Westerburg has no longer been a district seat.

Ecclesiastically, Westerburg was assigned to the St. Severus Monastery at Gemünden. The Late Romanesque tower of what is now an Evangelical church might stem from the first church building next to the castle chapel. A further chapel stood in the lower town by 1350. It is believed that shortly after 1560, the Reformation was introduced into Westerburg. Jews are first mentioned in 1616. In 1760, the Jewish community comprised 75 persons with one rabbi, and by 1754, there was a Jewish school. Public schooling is first known to have been instituted in 1557. Later, the school was also run temporarily as a Latin school.

The oldest census, from 1540, shows 124 assessable inhabitants. Eighty-six households are witnessed in 1607, and 39 in 1656. In 1760, 1,144 inhabitants were counted, and in 1807, 1,245.

Most inhabitants of course worked at agriculture or market gardening in the Middle Ages and on into early modern times, but they were hardly townsman farmers (&quot;Ackerbürger&quot;). Westerburg seems much more to have been a craft centre for the surrounding region in which even such rare crafts as arrowsmithing and crossbow making were settled. Also showing this are the many traders’ markets held in the town. Several guilds formed in this comparatively small town: in 1581 the bakers’ guild, which joined with the brewers’ guild in 1657, in 1532 the woolweavers’ and clothmakers’ guild (dissolved in 1710), in 1574 the tanners’ and shoemakers’ guild, in 1611 the linen weavers’ guild, and by 1658 also the tailors’ and merchants’. The woolweavers are known to have had their own hall, &quot;Westerburger Hall&quot; in Frankfurt am Main in 1605. Furthermore, it has been established that there were several mills, a forest smithy, a limekiln (mentioned in 1537) and a brickworks (built in 1612).

By 1518 there was also a sickhouse, and the town had an apothecary by 1697.

==Politics==

===Community council===

The municipal council in Westerburg consists of 22 council members, as well as the honorary and presiding mayor (&quot;Stadtbürgermeister&quot;), who were elected at the municipal elections on 25 May 2014.

The distribution of seats in the council is as follows:
* 

===Mayor===
Since 2019, Janick Pape (CDU) has been the town&#x27;s mayor.

===Town partnerships===
Westerburg has partnership arrangements with the following places:
* Daventry, Northamptonshire, England, United Kingdom
* Le Cateau-Cambrésis, Nord, France
* Nowa Wieś Wielka, Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship, Poland
* Złotoryja, Lower Silesian Voivodeship, Poland

==Economy and infrastructure==
The Westerburg countryside has at its disposal, by reason of its lying between the urban agglomerations of Rhine-Main and Cologne-Düsseldorf-Ruhr, great appeal (according to a self-description at its website)

To ensure it, the municipality and the chamber of commerce (&quot;Verein für Handel, Handwerk, Industrie und Gewerbe e.V.&quot;) undertook in early 2005 to work on professional local marketing for Westerburg and the Westerburger Land (the outlying countryside), in which all fields of economic and political endeavour in the town and the area took part.

===Transport===
Autobahnen A 3 (Cologne–Frankfurt), A 45 (Dortmund–Gießen) and A 48 (Montabaur–Trier) each lie roughly 20 km away.

Westerburg station lies on the Oberwesterwaldbahn (railway) to Limburg and Au (Sieg). From there, the cities of Cologne, Koblenz, Frankfurt am Main and Wiesbaden may be reached directly.

The opening of InterCityExpress service on the new Cologne-Frankfurt high-speed rail line with its Montabaur and Limburg stations with bring strengthened impetus to growth and development in the Westerburger Land.

Near Westerburg lies Ailertchen airport (ICAO code: EDGA).

===Education===
Westerburg is a schooling centre with every kind of school. The following educational institutions are to be found here:
* Konrad-Adenauer-Gymnasium
* Realschule Plus am Schlossberg
* Rolf-Simon-Schaumburger-Hauptschule
* Regenbogenschule (“Rainbow School”, primary school)
* Berufsbildende Schule Westerburg (vocational training school) with associated economic Gymnasium
* Friedrich-Schweizer-Schule (special school for students with learning disabilities)
* Adolf-Reichwein-Studienseminar for teaching office at primary schools and Hauptschulen
* Volkshochschule Westerburg (folk high school)
* Montessori-School Westerwald (A Primary school and Realschule combined, with the Montessori method, named after Maria Montesorri)

===Sport===
Among sporting venues are the Westerwaldstadion and the Schulsportstadion (stadiums), competitive track type B with grass playing field, plastic running track and further competition-ready facilities for athletics. In the runup to the 2006 FIFA World Cup, this was the training facility used by the Czech Republic national football team, who stayed in a sport hotel at the Wiesensee (lake) in the &quot;Verbandsgemeinde&quot; of Westerburg.

Furthermore, Westerburg has a heated swimming pool at its disposal with a sunbathing field. This is run by a private club and is open in the summer months, from about May to September.

==Culture and sightseeing==

===Buildings===
The castle, Schloss Westerburg, was first mentioned in 1192, and together with the castle church from the 16th century it is the town&#x27;s landmark.

<doc id="228547" wikidata="Q483604" url="?curid=228547" title="Mozilla Thunderbird">
<text>Mozilla Thunderbird is a free and open-source email client that also functions as a personal information manager with a calendar and contactbook, as well as an RSS feed reader, chat client (IRC/XMPP/Matrix), and news client. Operated by MZLA Technologies Corporation, a subsidiary of the Mozilla Foundation, Thunderbird is an independent, community-driven project that is managed and overseen by the Thunderbird Council, which is elected by the Thunderbird community. As a cross-platform application, Thunderbird is available for Windows, macOS, FreeBSD, Android, and Linux. The project strategy was originally modeled after that of Mozilla&#x27;s Firefox, and Thunderbird is an interface built on top of that Web browser.

== Overview ==
Thunderbird is an e-mail, newsgroup, news feed, and instant messaging client with personal information manager (PIM) functionality, inbuilt since version 78.0 and previously available from the Lightning calendar extension. Additional features are available from extensions, which allow the addition of features through the installation of XPInstall modules (known as &quot;XPI&quot; or &quot;zippy&quot; installation) via the add-ons Web site that also features an update functionality to update the extensions.

Thunderbird supports a variety of themes for changing its overall look and feel. These packages of CSS and image files can be downloaded via the add-ons website at Mozilla Add-ons.

With contributors all over the world, Thunderbird has been translated into more than 65 languages, although email addresses are currently limited to ASCII local parts. Thunderbird does not yet support SMTPUTF8 () or Email Address Internationalization.

==Email features==
===Message management===
Thunderbird manages multiple email, newsgroup, and news feed accounts and supports multiple identities within accounts. Features such as quick search, saved search folders (&quot;virtual folders&quot;), advanced message filtering, message grouping, and tags help manage and find messages. On Linux-based systems, system mail (movemail) accounts were supported until version 91.0. Thunderbird provides basic support for system-specific new email notifications and can be extended with advanced notification support using an add-on.

===Junk filtering===
Thunderbird incorporates a Bayesian spam filter, a whitelist based on the included address book, and can also understand classifications by server-based filters such as SpamAssassin.

===Standards support===
Thunderbird follows industry standards for email:
* POP. Basic email retrieval protocol.
* IMAP. Thunderbird has implemented many of the capabilities in IMAP, in addition to adding their own extensions and the de facto standards by Google and Apple.
* LDAP address auto-completion.
* S/MIME: Inbuilt support for email encryption and signing using X.509 keys provided by a centralized certificate authority.
* OpenPGP: Inbuilt support for email encryption and signing since version 78.2.1, while older versions used extensions such as Enigmail.

=== Authentication support ===
Email providers have increasing been introducing OAuth authentication in addition, or instead of, more traditional authentication methods, most notably by Gmail and Outlook. Thunderbird has full support for OAuth authentication and provides instructions for Outlook users transitioning from Outlook&#x27;s now-deprecated &quot;basic authentication&quot;.

===File formats supported===
Thunderbird provides mailbox format support using plugins, but this feature is not yet enabled due to related work in progress. The mailbox formats supported are:
* mbox – Unix mailbox format (one file holding many emails)
* maildir – known as maildir-lite (one file per email). &quot;there are still many bugs&quot;, so this is disabled by default.

Thunderbird also uses Mork and (since version 3) MozStorage (which is based on SQLite) for its internal database. Mork was due to be replaced with MozStorage in Thunderbird 3.0, but the 8.0 release still uses the Mork file format.

===Big file linking===
Since version 38, Thunderbird has integrated support for automatic linking of large files instead of attaching them directly to the mail message.

===HTML formatting and code insertion===
Thunderbird provides a wysiwyg editor for composing messages formatted with HTML (default). The delivery format auto-detect feature will send unformatted messages as plain text (controlled by a user preference). Certain special formatting like subscript, superscript and strikethrough is available from the Format menu. The Insert &gt; HTML menu provides the ability to edit the HTML source code of the message. There is basic support for HTML template messages, which are stored in a dedicated templates folder for each account.

Markdown support is provided through the Markdown here Revival add-on.

===Security===
Thunderbird provides security features such as TLS/SSL connections to IMAP and SMTP servers. It also offers inbuilt support for secure email with digital signing and message encryption through OpenPGP (using public and private keys) or S/MIME (using certificates). Any of these security features can take advantage of smartcards with the installation of additional extensions.

Other security features may be added through extensions. Up to version 68, the Enigmail extension was required for OpenPGP support (now inbuilt).

Optional security protections also include disabling loading of remote images within messages, enabling only specific media types (sanitizer), and disabling JavaScript.

The French military uses Thunderbird and contributes to its security features, which are claimed to match the requirements for NATO&#x27;s closed messaging system.

=== Limitations and known issues ===
As with any software, there may be limitations to the number and sizes of files and objects represented. For example, POP3 folders are subject to filesystem design limitations, such as maximum file sizes on filesystems that do not have large-file support, as well as possible limitations of long filenames, and other issues.

== Other features ==

While primarily used as an email client, Thunderbird is also a news aggregator, which is named &quot;News Feeds and Blogs&quot; in the application. It supports RSS and more recently added Atom as well.

The software has a chat client for instant messaging, supporting the IRC, XMPP, and (since version 102) Matrix protocols, and the Odnoklassniki network. In the past, it also had support for Twitter, Google Talk and Facebook Chat.

Thunderbird is also a newsreader for Usenet, using the NNTP protocol and supports NNTPS. Intended for reading use, it does not support NZB for binary downloading, nor does it have a search function for the newsgroups.

As of version 91, Thunderbird introduced a built-in PDF document reader, allowing users to open and view PDF attachments or files directly within the application without needing an external PDF viewer.

== Cross-platform support ==

Thunderbird runs on a variety of platforms. Releases available on the primary distribution site support the following operating systems:
* Linux
* Windows
* macOS

Unofficial ports are available for:
* FreeBSD
* OpenBSD

Ports for older versions available for OS/2 (including ArcaOS and eComStation).

The source code is freely available and can be compiled to be run on a variety of other architectures and operating systems.

=== Android and iOS versions ===
In June 2022, the Thunderbird project announced that it would be collaborating with email client K-9 for Android to build a Thunderbird version for Android. To this end, K-9 lead developer Christian Ketterer joined the Thunderbird team in 2022. The plan was to transform K-9 Mail into Thunderbird on Android, including the respective name change and adoption of the Thunderbird branding. As soon as K-9 Mail had been brought into alignment with Thunderbird&#x27;s feature set and visual appearance, this changeover would take place, according to Thunderbird&#x27;s Jason Evangelho.

In the 2022 Financial Report published on May 8th, 2023, Ryan Sipes (Product and Business Development Manager) mentions plans of hiring an iOS developer later that same year to start laying the foundation for Thunderbird on iOS.

The first Thunderbird-branded version for Android was released as a beta version on September 30, 2024, with anticipation for a final release in October 2024.

==History and development==

=== 2003—2010 ===
Originally launched as &quot;Minotaur&quot; shortly after &quot;Phoenix&quot; (the original name for Mozilla Firefox), the project failed to gain momentum. With the success of Firefox, however, demand increased for a mail client to go with it, and the work on Minotaur was revived under the new name of Thunderbird, and migrated to the new toolkit developed by the Firefox team.

On December 7, 2004, version 1.0 was released, and received more than 500,000 downloads in its first three days of release, and 1,000,000 in ten days.

Significant work on Thunderbird restarted with the announcement that from version 1.5 onward the main Mozilla suite would be designed around separate applications using this new toolkit. This contrasts with the previous all-in-one approach, allowing users to mix and match the Mozilla applications with alternatives. The original Mozilla Suite continues to be developed as SeaMonkey.

On December 23, 2004, Project Lightning was announced which tightly integrated calendar functionality (scheduling, tasks, etc.) into Thunderbird. Lightning supports the full range of calendar mechanisms and protocols supported by the Mozilla Calendar infrastructure, just as with modern (post-0.2) Sunbird.

On October 11, 2006, Qualcomm and the Mozilla Foundation announced that &quot;future versions of Eudora will be based upon the same technology platform as the open source Mozilla Thunderbird email program.&quot; The project was code-named Penelope.

In late 2006, Debian rebranded Thunderbird as Icedove due to trademark and copyright reasons. This was the second product to be rebranded.

On July 26, 2007, the Mozilla Foundation announced that Thunderbird would be developed by an independent organization, because the Mozilla Corporation (a subsidiary of the foundation) was focusing on Mozilla Firefox development.

On September 17, 2007, the Mozilla Foundation announced the funding of a new internet communications initiative with David Ascher of ActiveState. The purpose of this initiative was &quot;to develop Internet communications software based on the Thunderbird product, code, and brand&quot;.

On February 19, 2008, Mozilla Messaging started operations as a subsidiary of the Mozilla Foundation responsible for the development of email and similar communications. Its initial focus was on the then upcoming version of Thunderbird 3. Alpha Preview releases of Thunderbird 3 were codenamed &quot;Shredder&quot;. 

=== 2011—2016 ===

On April 4, 2011, Mozilla Messaging was merged into the Mozilla Labs group of the Mozilla Foundation.

Following in the footsteps of Firefox, Thunderbird switched to a rapid release cycle in 2011. Version 4.0 was skipped so as to re-align Thunderbird with Firefox&#x27;s version 5.0, both released in June 2011. By the end of the year it had reached version 9.0.

On July 6, 2012, a confidential memo from Jb Piacentino, the Thunderbird Managing Director at Mozilla, was leaked and published to TechCrunch. The memo indicated that Mozilla would be moving some of the team off the project and further development of new features would be left up to the community. The memo was slated for release on July 9, 2012. A subsequent article by the Executive Chair of Mozilla, Mitchell Baker, stated Mozilla&#x27;s decision to make a transition of Thunderbird to a new release and governance model. On July 6, 2012, Mozilla announced the company was dropping the priority of Thunderbird development because the continuous effort to extend Thunderbird&#x27;s feature set was mostly fruitless. The new development model shifted to Mozilla offering only &quot;Extended Support Releases&quot;, which deliver security and maintenance updates, while allowing the community to take over the development of new features.

On November 25, 2014, Kent James of the volunteer-led Thunderbird Council announced on the Thunderbird blog that active contributors to Thunderbird gathered at the Mozilla office in Toronto and discussed the future of the application. They decided that more staff were required working full-time on Thunderbird so that the Thunderbird Team could release a stable and reliable product and make progress on features that had been frequently requested by the community.

On December 1, 2015, Mozilla Executive Chair Mitchell Baker announced in a company-wide memo that Thunderbird development needed to be uncoupled from Firefox. She referred to Thunderbird developers spending large efforts responding to changes to Mozilla technologies, while Firefox was paying a tax to support Thunderbird development. She also said that she does not believe Thunderbird has the potential for &quot;industry-wide impact&quot; that Firefox does. Mozilla remained interested in having a role in Thunderbird, but sought more assistance to help with development. Therefore, at the same time, it was announced that Mozilla Foundation would provide at least a temporary legal and financial home for the Thunderbird project.

=== 2017—present ===
On May 9, 2017, Philipp Kewisch announced that the Mozilla Foundation would continue to serve as the legal and fiscal home for the Thunderbird project, but that Thunderbird would migrate off Mozilla Corporation infrastructure, separating the operational aspects of the project. Mozilla brought Thunderbird back in-house in an announcement on May 9, 2017, and continued to support its development. The Thunderbird development team expanded by adding several new members and overhauled security and the user interface.

The interim/beta versions Thunderbird 57 and 58, released in late 2017, began to make changes influenced by Firefox Quantum, including a new &quot;Photon&quot; user interface. Despite the removal in Firefox Quantum of support for XUL-based legacy add-ons in favor of WebExtensions, the stable/ESR release of Thunderbird 60 in mid-2018 continued to support them, although most would require updates, and it did not support WebExtensions except for Themes. In 2018, work was underway for planned support in Thunderbird 63 of WebExtensions and to continue to &quot;somewhat&quot; support legacy addons, according to Mozilla.

With the release of Thunderbird 68 in August 2019 it now only supports WebExtension addons. Legacy Addons can still be used if a special &quot;legacy mode&quot; is enabled, but even for this, the legacy Addon has to be converted. Alongside the transition, OpenPGP support was integrated directly into Thunderbird as a standard feature, seeking to supplant the Enigmail extension. Mainly for licensing reasons, this is no longer based on GnuPG, but on the RNP library, which has more liberal licensing terms.

On January 28, 2020, the Mozilla Foundation announced that the project would henceforth be operating from a new wholly owned subsidiary, MZLA Technologies Corporation, in order to explore offering products and services that were not previously possible and to collect revenue through partnerships and non-charitable donations.

As of version 78.7.1, Thunderbird will no longer allow installation of addons that use Legacy WebExtensions. Only MailExtensions are now compatible with Thunderbird. MailExtensions are WebExtensions but with &quot;some added features specific to Thunderbird&quot;.

Thunderbird 91 features various UI improvements (including a new account setup workflow), Apple silicon support, CardDAV address book support, built-in import and export tools for Thunderbird profiles, the PDF.js PDF viewer, and the ability to encrypt emails to BCC recipients.

On June 13, 2022, it was announced that the Mozilla Thunderbird team would take over development of the Android email client app K-9 Mail, with plans for it to eventually become a mobile version of Thunderbird with synchronisation support.

In November 2024, Thunderbird Mobile became available for download, and in December 2024, iodéOS, an open source Android operating system, began including Thunderbird Mobile as the default email client for some 30+ devices.

===Releases===
Thunderbird development releases occur in three stages, called Beta, Earlybird, and Daily, which correspond to Firefox&#x27;s Beta, Aurora, and Nightly stages. The release dates and Gecko versions are exactly the same as Firefox; for example, Firefox 7 and Thunderbird 7 were both released on September 27, 2011, and were both based on Gecko 7.0.

<doc id="228551" wikidata="Q228885" url="?curid=228551" title="Eleanor of Provence">
<text>Eleanor of Provence ( 1223 – 24/25 June 1291) was a Provençal noblewoman who became Queen of England as the wife of King Henry III from 1236 until his death in 1272. She served as regent of England during the absence of her spouse in France in 1253.

Although Eleanor was completely devoted to her husband and staunchly defended him against the rebel Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, she was very unpopular among the Londoners. This was because she had brought many relatives with her to England in her retinue; these were known as &quot;the Savoyards&quot; (her mother was from Savoy), and, as Londoners saw it, these foreigners were given influential positions in the government and realm to lord over them. On one occasion, Eleanor&#x27;s barge was attacked by angry Londoners who pelted her with stones, mud, pieces of paving, rotten eggs and vegetables.

Eleanor had five children, including the future King Edward I of England. She also was renowned for her cleverness, skill at writing poetry, and as a leader of fashion.

==Early life and family==
Born in the city of Aix-en-Provence in southern France, she was the second daughter of Ramon Berenguer V, Count of Provence (1198–1245) and Beatrice of Savoy (1198–1267), the second of four daughters of Thomas I of Savoy and his wife Margaret of Geneva. Two sons were born before the daughters, but they died very young. Eleanor was probably born latest in 1223; Matthew Paris describes her as being &quot;jamque duodennem&quot; (already twelve) when she arrived in the Kingdom of England for her marriage

She was well educated as a child and developed a strong love of reading, partly due to the influence of her tutor Romée de Villeneuve. Her three sisters also married kings. Like her mother, grandmother, and sisters, Eleanor was renowned for her beauty. She was a dark-haired brunette with fine eyes. Piers Langtoft speaks of her as &quot;The erle&#x27;s daughter, the fairest may of life&quot;.

Her elder sister Margaret married Louis, King of France, and of her younger sisters Sanchia was to marry Richard of Cornwall, Henry&#x27;s brother who was to become King of the Romans, and Beatrice was to marry Louis&#x27; brother Charles of Anjou, the King of Sicily. She was especially close to Margaret, to whom she was close in age, and with whom she sustained friendly relationships until they grew old.

==Marriage negotiations==

Henry investigated a range of potential marriage partners in his youth, but they all proved unsuitable for reasons of European and domestic politics.

After her elder sister Margaret married Louis IX of France, their uncle William corresponded with Henry III of England to persuade him to marry Eleanor. Henry sought a dowry of up to twenty thousand silver marks to help offset the dowry he had just paid for his sister Isabella, but Eleanor&#x27;s father was able to negotiate this down to no dowry, just a promise to leave her ten thousand marks when he died.

On 22 June 1235, the marriage contract was confirmed; Eleanor was betrothed to King Henry III (1207–1272).

==Queen consort==
===Wedding and coronation===

Eleanor was married to King Henry III of England on 14 January 1236. At the time, she was either 12 or 13 years old, while he was 28. She had never seen Henry prior to the wedding at Canterbury Cathedral and had never set foot in his kingdom. Edmund Rich, Archbishop of Canterbury, officiated. She was dressed in a shimmering golden dress that fitted tightly at the waist and flared out to wide pleats at her feet. The sleeves were long and lined with ermine. After riding to London the same day where a procession of citizens greeted the bridal pair, Eleanor was crowned queen consort of England in a ceremony at Westminster Abbey planned by Henry which was followed by a magnificent banquet with the entire nobility in full attendance. Her love for her husband grew significantly from 1236 onward.

Through her marriage with Henry she acquired at her coronation the titles of Queen of England, Lady of Ireland and Duchess of Aquitaine. She was also acquired the titles of Duchess of Normandy and Countess of Anjou although these already symbolic claims were dropped as part of the 1259 Treaty of Paris.

Despite the substantial age gap the historian Margaret Howell observes that the King &quot;was generous and warm-hearted and prepared to lavish care and affection on his wife&quot;. Henry gave Eleanor extensive gifts and paid personal attention to establishing and equipping her household. He also brought her fully into his religious life, including involving her in his devotion to Edward the Confessor.

===Responsibilities===

Though Eleanor and Henry supported different factions at times, she was a loyal and faithful consort and was made regent of England when her husband went to suppress a rebellion in Gascony in 1253, although this was after a quarrel about the Gascon revolt that had lasted a year. (During this time she exercised the functions of Lord Chancellor, the only woman to do so until Liz Truss was appointed to the office in 2016.)

Eleanor was devoted to her husband&#x27;s cause. Although originally supportive of the Simon de Montfort when he was an ally of Henry, she was a strong opponent when de Montfort led the English Barons against Henry, raising mercenary troops in France for her husband. Her influence with her sister Margaret, Louis IX&#x27;s wife meant that Henry had some support from France.

The primary reason Eleanor was chosen was the chance to create a valuable set of alliances with the rulers of the south and south-east of France which meant Eleanor brought in her retinue a large number of often related Savoyards many of whom become prominent thanks to Henry&#x27;s patronage which caused friction with the English barons. Her uncle Peter was particularly influential as her early advisor before he inherited the County of Savoy.

The Savoyards would later be opposed to the Lusignan faction of Henry&#x27;s Poitevin half brothers. Many Savoyards, probably including Eleanor, backed a 1258 coup d&#x27;état by a coalition of English barons who expelled the Poitevins from England, reforming the royal government through a process called the Provisions of Oxford.

===Religious life===

During her early years as queen, her religious formation was under the guidance of the royal physician and confessor Nicholas Farnham, later Bishop of Durham. She was also friendly with the Franciscan Adam Marsh and the reforming bishops Richard of Chichester and Robert Grosseteste, Bishop of London. Eleanor shared her husband&#x27;s devotion to faith.

===Attack by Londoners ===

Eleanor stoutly hated the Londoners, who returned her hatred; in revenge for their dislike, Eleanor had demanded from the city all the back payments due on the monetary tribute known as &quot;queen-gold&quot;, by which she received a tenth of all fines which came to the Crown. In addition to the &quot;queen-gold&quot;, other such fines were levied on the citizens by the Queen on the thinnest of pretexts.

During the Second Barons War in 1263, London had risen in revolt. Henry and Eleanor were trapped in the Tower of London. On 13 July 1263, she attempted to escape by sailing down the Thames to Edward&#x27;s army when her barge was attacked by citizens of London. In fear for her life as she was pelted with stones, loose pieces of paving, dried mud, rotten eggs and vegetables, Eleanor was rescued by Thomas Fitzthomas, the Mayor of London, and took refuge at the bishop of London&#x27;s home. This meant that she and her husband were in effect prisoners of De Montfort.

==Queen dowager and death==
===Early widowhood===
In 1272, Henry died, and her son Edward, who was 33 years old, became king of England. She remained in England as queen dowager and raised several of her grandchildren: Two of Edward&#x27;s children, Henry and Eleanor, as well as Beatrice&#x27;s son John of Brittany.

In 1273, after an earlier dispute over its control, Queen Eleanor granted a new charter and additional endowment to the hospital of St Katharine by the Tower in memory of Henry, reserving the foundation&#x27;s patronage to the queens of England.

When her grandson Henry died in her care in 1274, Eleanor went into mourning and gave orders for his heart to be buried at the Dominican priory at Guildford, which she founded in his memory. Eleanor&#x27;s two remaining daughters died in 1275, Margaret on 26 February and Beatrice on 24 March.

===Expulsion of the Jews from Dower lands===
Eleanor was noted for her hostility to Jews and Judaism. On 16 January 1275, she received permission from Edward I to expel the Jews from all of her lands. Jews were expelled from Marlborough, Gloucester, Worcester and Cambridge. The Jews of Cambridge were instructed to flee to Norwich, and those of Marlborough to Devizes. The Jews of Gloucester were ordered to move to Bristol, but were worried because of anti-Jewish violence that had occurred there, and instead mostly chose to move to Hereford along with those forced to leave nearby Worcester.

===Amesbury Priory===

She became a nun and retired in 1286 to Amesbury Priory in Wiltshire, eight miles north of Salisbury, as Henry II&#x27;s widow, Eleanor of Aquitaine, had taken up residence at the mother abbey, Fontevraud. She was visited there by her son, King Edward. Two of her granddaughters – Mary of Woodstock (daughter of Edward) and Eleanor of Brittany – were already nuns there, each having entered the priory on reaching the age of seven.

Eleanor died on 24/25 June 1291 at the priory and was buried there. The site of her grave is unknown, making her the only English queen without a marked grave. Her heart was taken to London where it was buried at the Franciscan priory of Greyfriars.

==Cultural legacy==
Eleanor was renowned for her learning, cleverness, and skill at writing poetry, as well as her beauty and antisemitism; she was also known as a leader of fashion, continually importing clothes from France. She favoured red silk damask and often wore parti-coloured cottes (a type of tunic), gold or silver girdles into which a dagger was casually thrust, and decorations of gilt quatrefoil. To cover her dark hair, she wore jaunty pillbox caps. Eleanor introduced a new type of wimple to England, which was high, &quot;into which the head receded until the face seemed like a flower in an enveloping spathe&quot;.

She had developed a love for the songs of the troubadours as a child and continued this interest into adulthood. She bought many romantic and historical books that included stories from ancient times to contemporary romances written in the period (13th century).

Eleanor is the protagonist of &quot;The Queen From Provence&quot;, a historical romance by British novelist Jean Plaidy which was published in 1979. Eleanor is a main character in the novel &quot;Four Sisters, All Queens&quot; by author Sherry Jones, as well as the novels &quot;The Sister Queens&quot; by Sophie Perinot, &quot;Falls The Shadow&quot; by Sharon Kay Penman, and &quot;My Fair Lady: A Story of Henry III&#x27;s Lost Queen&quot; by J. P. Reedman. She is also the subject of Norwegian Symphonic metal band Leave&#x27;s Eyes in their song &quot;Eleonore De Provence&quot; from their album &quot;Symphonies of the Night&quot;.

==Issue==
Despite initial concerns that the Queen might be barren, Eleanor and Henry had five children together. Eleanor seems to have been especially devoted to her eldest son, Edward; when he was deathly ill in 1246, she stayed with him at the abbey at Beaulieu in Hampshire for three weeks, long past the time allowed by monastic rules. She personally supervised Edward&#x27;s upbringing and education. It was because of her influence that King Henry granted the duchy of Gascony to Edward in 1249. Her youngest child, Katherine, seems to have had a degenerative disease that rendered her deaf. When the little girl died at the age of three, both her royal parents suffered overwhelming grief. Eleanor possibly had four other sons who also died in childhood, but their existence is in doubt as there is no contemporary record of them.

#Edward I (1239–1307), married Eleanor of Castile (1241–1290) in 1254, by whom he had issue, including his heir Edward II. His second wife was Margaret of France, by whom he had issue.
#Margaret (1240–1275), married King Alexander III of Scotland, by whom she had issue.
#Beatrice (1242–1275), married John II, Duke of Brittany, by whom she had issue.
#Edmund Crouchback, 1st Earl of Lancaster (1245–1296), married Aveline de Forz in 1269, who died four years later without issue; married Blanche of Artois in 1276, by whom he had issue.
#Katherine (25 November 1253 – 3 May 1257)

The children spent most of their childhood at Windsor Castle and Henry appears to have been extremely attached to them, rarely spending extended periods of time apart from his family.

==Historiography==

Some historians have regarded her as the most unpopular queen in England.
Historians Margaret Howell and David Carpenter describe her as being &quot;more combative&quot; and &quot;far tougher and more determined&quot; than her husband.

<text>Hugo Ball (; 22 February 1886 – 14 September 1927) was a German author, poet, and essentially the founder of the Dada movement in European art in Zürich in 1916. Among other accomplishments, he was a pioneer in the development of sound poetry.

== Life and work ==
Hugo Ball was born in Pirmasens, Germany, and was raised in a middle-class Catholic family. He studied sociology and philosophy at the universities of Munich and Heidelberg (1906–1907). In 1910, he moved to Berlin in order to become an actor and collaborated with Max Reinhardt. At the beginning of World War I, he tried joining the army as a volunteer, but was denied enlistment for medical reasons. After witnessing the invasion of Belgium, he was disillusioned, saying: &quot;The war is founded on a glaring mistake – men have been confused with machines.&quot; Considered a traitor in his country, he crossed the frontier with the cabaret performer and poet Emmy Hennings, whom he would marry in 1920, and settled in Zürich, Switzerland. There, Ball continued his interest in anarchism and in Mikhail Bakunin in particular; he also worked on a book of translations of works by Bakunin, which never got published. Although interested in anarchist philosophy, he nonetheless rejected it for its militant aspects, and viewed it as only a means to his personal goal of socio-political enlightenment.

In 1916, Hugo Ball created the Dada Manifesto, making a political statement about his views on the terrible state of society and acknowledging his dislike for philosophies of the past that claimed to possess the ultimate truth. In the manifesto Ball aimed to legitimize the new artistic movement&#x27;s ambition to not merely &quot;write poetry with words&quot;, but to &quot;write poetry out of the words&quot;, to create an entirely new language, because the old language was viewed as &quot;doomed&quot;, and &quot;ruined by the filthy hands of capital&quot;. The central thought of modernism since Baudelaire regarding that the language has to be fixed, is here given a distinctive critique of economy as a motivation. The same year as the &quot;Manifesto&quot;, in 1916, Ball wrote his poem &quot;,&quot; a poem consisting of nonsensical words. The meaning, however, resides in its meaninglessness, reflecting the chief principle behind Dadaism. Some of his other best known works include the poem collection &#x27;, the drama &#x27;, a memoir of the Zürich period &quot;Flight Out of Time: A Dada Diary&quot;, and a biography of Hermann Hesse, entitled &quot;&quot; (1927).

As co-founder of the Cabaret Voltaire and a magazine with the same name, &quot;Cabaret Voltaire&quot;, in Zürich, he led the Dada movement in Zürich and is one of the people credited with naming the movement &quot;Dada,&quot; by allegedly choosing the word at random from a dictionary. His companion and future wife, Emmy Hennings, was also a member of Dada.

His involvement with the Dada movement lasted approximately two years. He then worked for a short period as a journalist for &quot;&quot; in Bern. After returning to Catholicism in July 1920, Ball retired to the canton of Ticino, where he lived a religious and relatively poor life with Emmy Hennings. He contributed to the journal &quot;Hochland&quot; during this time. He also began the process of revising his diaries from 1910 to 1921, which were later published under the title &quot;Die Flucht aus der Zeit&quot; (Flight Out of Time). These diaries provide a wealth of information concerning the people and events of the Zürich Dada movement. He died in Sant&#x27;Abbondio (Gentilino), Switzerland, of stomach cancer on 14 September 1927.

==Adaptations==
Ball&#x27;s poem &quot;Gadji beri bimba&quot; was adapted to the song &quot;I Zimbra&quot; on the 1979 Talking Heads album &quot;Fear of Music&quot;. Ball received a writing credit for the song on the track listing.

The song contains these lines:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em;&quot;&gt;Gadji beri bimba clandridi
Lauli lonni cadori gadjam
A bim beri glassala glandride
E glassala tuffm I zimbra&lt;/poem&gt;

The complete &quot;Gadji beri bimba&quot; poem by Ball reads:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em;&quot;&gt;gadji beri bimba glandridi laula lonni cadori

A voice-cut-up collage of his poem &quot;Karawane&quot; by German artist Kommissar Hjuler, member of Boris Lurie&#x27;s NO!art movement, was released on an LP on the Greek Shamanic Trance label in 2010. &quot;Karawane&quot; was also set to music in 2012 by Australian composer Stephen Whittington, as an &quot;anti-song cycle&quot; of seventeen songs — one for each line of the poem, lasting approximately two minutes each. The same poem and its historical context was used by Esa-Pekka Salonen for his 28-minute composition &quot;Karawane&quot; for mixed choir and orchestra.

<doc id="228564" wikidata="Q334102" url="?curid=228564" title="Jeremy Thorpe">
<text>John Jeremy Thorpe (29 April 1929 – 4 December 2014) was a British politician who served as the Member of Parliament for North Devon from 1959 to 1979 and as leader of the Liberal Party from 1967 to 1976. In May 1979 he was tried at the Old Bailey on charges of conspiracy and incitement to murder his ex-boyfriend Norman Scott, a former model. Thorpe was acquitted on all charges, but the case, and the furore surrounding it, ended his political career.

Thorpe was the son and grandson of Conservative MPs, but decided to align with the small and ailing Liberal Party. After reading Law at Oxford University he became one of the Liberals&#x27; brightest stars in the 1950s. He entered Parliament at the age of 30, rapidly made his mark, and was elected party leader in 1967. After an uncertain start during which the party lost ground, Thorpe capitalised on the growing unpopularity of the Conservative and Labour parties to lead the Liberals through a period of electoral success. This culminated in the general election of February 1974, when the party won 6 million votes out of some 31 million cast. Under the first-past-the-post electoral system this gave them only 14 seats, but in a hung parliament, no party having an overall majority, Thorpe was in a strong position. He was offered a cabinet post by the Conservative prime minister, Edward Heath, if he would bring the Liberals into a coalition. His price for such a deal, reform of the electoral system, was rejected by Heath, who resigned in favour of a minority Labour government.

The February 1974 election was the high-water mark of Thorpe&#x27;s career. Thereafter his and his party&#x27;s fortunes declined, particularly from late 1975 when rumours of his involvement in a plot to murder Norman Scott began to multiply. Thorpe resigned the leadership in May 1976 when his position became untenable. When the matter came to court three years later, Thorpe chose not to give evidence to avoid being cross-examined by counsel for the prosecution. This left many questions unanswered; despite his acquittal, Thorpe was discredited and did not return to public life. From the mid-1980s he was disabled by Parkinson&#x27;s disease. During his long retirement he gradually recovered the affections of his party, and by the time of his death was honoured by a later generation of leaders, who drew attention to his record as an internationalist, a supporter of human rights and an opponent of apartheid and all forms of racism.

==Family background and early childhood==

Thorpe was born in South Kensington, London, on 29 April 1929. His father was John Henry Thorpe, a lawyer and politician who was the Conservative MP for Manchester Rusholme between 1919 and 1923. His mother, Ursula Norton-Griffiths (1903–1992), was the daughter of another Conservative MP, Sir John Norton-Griffiths, widely known as &quot;Empire Jack&quot; because of his passionate imperialism. The Thorpe family claimed kinship with distant forebears carrying the name, including Sir Robert Thorpe, who was briefly Lord Chancellor in 1372, and Thomas Thorpe, who was Speaker of the House of Commons in 1453–54. There is no direct evidence of any link between these figures and Jeremy Thorpe&#x27;s family.

The more recent Thorpe ancestors were Irish, stemming from the elder of two brothers who were, according to family tradition, soldiers under Cromwell during the re-conquest of Ireland. Both were rewarded with land; the descendants of the younger brother—from County Carlow—prospered in Dublin as High Sheriffs and Lord Mayors, but those of the elder lost their land and became tenant farmers and tradesmen. Jeremy Thorpe&#x27;s great-grandfather, William Thorpe, was a Dublin policeman who, having been a labourer, joined the police as a constable and rose to the rank of superintendent. One of his many sons, John Thorpe, became an Anglican priest and served as Archdeacon of Macclesfield from 1922 to 1932. The archdeacon&#x27;s marriage in 1884 to a daughter of the prosperous Anglo-Irish Aylmer family brought considerable wealth to the Thorpes, as did his elder daughter Olive&#x27;s marriage into the influential Christie-Miller family of Cheshire. Both John Henry and Jeremy Thorpe would benefit from this connection, as the Christie-Millers paid the costs of their education.

Jeremy was his parents&#x27; third child, following two sisters. His upbringing was privileged and protected, under the care of nannies and nursemaids until, in 1935, he began attending Wagner&#x27;s day school in Queen&#x27;s Gate. He became a proficient violinist, and often performed at school concerts. Although John Henry Thorpe was no longer in parliament, he had maintained many of his political contacts and friendships, and leading politicians were regularly entertained at the Thorpe home. Among the strongest of these friendships was that with the Lloyd George family—Ursula Thorpe was a close friend of the former Liberal prime minister&#x27;s daughter, Megan, who became Jeremy&#x27;s godmother. The former prime minister David Lloyd George, an occasional visitor, became Jeremy&#x27;s political hero and role model, and helped form his ambitions for a political career in the Liberal Party.

==Education==

===Schooling===
In January 1938 Jeremy went to Cothill House, a school in Oxfordshire that prepared boys for entry to Eton. By mid-1939 war looked likely, and the Thorpe family moved from London to the Surrey village of Limpsfield where Jeremy attended Hazelwood School. War began in September 1939; in June 1940, with invasion threatening, the Thorpe children were sent to live with their American aunt, Kay Norton-Griffiths, in Boston. In September that year Jeremy began at the Rectory School in Pomfret, Connecticut. He remained there for three generally happy years; his main extracurricular task, he later recalled, was looking after the school&#x27;s pigs. In 1943 it was thought safe for the children to return to England, and John Henry used his political connections to secure for Jeremy a passage in the Royal Navy cruiser HMS &quot;Phoebe&quot;.

Thorpe started at Eton in September 1943. He proved an indifferent scholar, he lacked sporting aptitude, and although superficially a rebel against conformity, his frequent toadying to authority earned him the nickname &quot;Oily Thorpe&quot;. He also annoyed his fellow-pupils by parading his acquaintance with a range of famous and important people. He offended the school&#x27;s traditionalists by resigning from the school&#x27;s cadet force, and shocked others by expressing his intention to marry Princess Margaret, then second in line to the British throne. Thorpe revealed little about his Eton years, beyond his membership of the school orchestra and his winning a cup for his violin playing—he briefly considered the possibility of a career as a professional violinist. His time at Eton was marred by the death of his father in 1944, at the age of 57.

===Oxford===

Having secured a place at Trinity College, Oxford, Thorpe left Eton in March 1947. In September he began 18 months&#x27; National Service, but within six weeks was discharged on medical grounds after collapsing while attempting an assault course. As his place at Oxford was unavailable until the following year, Thorpe worked as a temporary preparatory school teacher before his admission to Trinity on 8 October 1948.

Thorpe was reading Law, but his primary interests at Oxford were political and social. From his earliest undergraduate days he drew attention to himself by his flamboyant behaviour; according to Thorpe&#x27;s biographer, Michael Bloch, his &quot;pallid appearance, dark hair and eyes and angular features, gave him a diabolonian air&quot;. He was quick to seek political office, initially in the Oxford University Liberal Club (OULC) which, despite the doldrums affecting the Liberal Party nationally, was a thriving club with over 800 members. Thorpe was elected to the club&#x27;s committee at the end of his first term; in November 1949 he became its president. Outside Oxford, Thorpe showed a genuine commitment to Liberalism in his enthusiastic contributions to the party&#x27;s national election campaigns, and on reaching his 21st birthday in April 1950, applied to have his name added to the party&#x27;s list of possible parliamentary candidates.

Beyond the OULC, Thorpe achieved the presidency of the Oxford University Law Society, although his principal objective was the presidency of the Oxford Union, an office frequently used as a stepping-stone to national prominence. Normally, would-be presidents first served in the Union&#x27;s junior offices, as Secretary, Treasurer or Librarian, but Thorpe, having impressed as a confident and forceful debater, decided early in 1950 to try directly for the presidency. He was easily defeated by the future broadcaster Robin Day. His single-minded pursuit of office, and the dubious strategies he sometimes employed, led to some acrimonious campaigns, but he gained many supporters, and later in 1950 beat two formidable contenders—the socialist Dick Taverne and the Conservative William Rees-Mogg—to secure the presidency for the Hilary term of 1951.

Thorpe&#x27;s term as president was marked by the range of distinguished guest speakers that he recruited, among them the future Lord Chancellor Lord Hailsham, the barrister and former Liberal MP Norman Birkett, and the humorist Stephen Potter. The time-consuming nature of his various offices meant that Thorpe required a fourth year to complete his law studies, which ended in the summer of 1952 with a third-class honours degree.

At Oxford, Thorpe enjoyed numerous friendships with his contemporaries, many of whom later achieved distinction. These were almost exclusively with men; even so, he was not identified as a member of any of Oxford&#x27;s homosexual sets. He confided to a friend that politics provided him with the necessary level of emotional excitement, thus making sexual relationships unnecessary. Thus, Bloch suggests, he was accepted by his fellow-students as &quot;a basically asexual character, wrapped up in politics and his career&quot;.

==Early career==

===Parliamentary candidate===
Having been accepted as a potential Liberal parliamentary candidate, Thorpe looked for a constituency. The general elections of 1950 and 1951 had seen the party&#x27;s MPs fall, first to nine, then six; some commentators saw little future except &quot;further attrition and further losses to the two major parties&quot;. The journalist Julian Glover writes that Thorpe&#x27;s determination to stay with the party, despite its woes, showed a more principled commitment to Liberalism than many critics have acknowledged; his prospects of reaching parliament would have been considerably greater within either the Conservative or Labour parties.

Initially the young would-be candidate was offered the opportunity of succeeding the party leader, Clement Davies, in the Welsh seat of Montgomeryshire, when Davies decided to retire. There being no immediate prospect of that, Thorpe looked elsewhere, in particular to Devon and Cornwall, where the party had long-standing traditions and had polled respectably in 1950 and 1951. In these elections Thorpe had assisted the Liberal candidate for North Cornwall, Dingle Foot, whose agent recommended him to the neighbouring North Devon constituency. The Torrington local party was also anxious to adopt Thorpe as their candidate, while Foot saw him as a possible successor in North Cornwall. Thorpe chose to fight North Devon, a seat once held by the Liberals although, in 1951, the party had finished in third place behind Conservative and Labour, with less than 20% of the vote.

Thorpe was adopted as North Devon&#x27;s Liberal candidate in April 1952. His political stance matched that of other young activists, who believed that the party should offer a radical non-socialist alternative to the Conservative government. He and others founded the Radical Reform Group, to drive the party in that direction. He spent much of his spare time cultivating the voters in North Devon; at rallies and on the doorstep he mixed local concerns with conspicuously liberal views on larger, international issues such as colonialism and apartheid. When Anthony Eden, who had succeeded Winston Churchill as prime minister, called a snap general election in April 1955, Thorpe fought an energetic local campaign. He succeeded in halving the Conservative majority in the constituency, and restoring the Liberals to second place.

===Barrister-at-law and television journalist===
In need of a paid occupation Thorpe opted for the law, and in February 1954 was called to the bar in the Inner Temple. Initially he found it difficult to earn a living from his fees; he needed another source of income, and found it in television journalism. Thorpe was employed by Associated-Rediffusion, at first as chairman of a science discussion programme, &quot;The Scientist Replies&quot;, and later as an interviewer on the station&#x27;s major current affairs vehicle &quot;This Week&quot;. Among various assignments for &quot;This Week&quot;, he travelled to Ghana in 1957 to cover the country&#x27;s independence celebrations, and in 1958 he reported from Jordan on a plot to assassinate King Hussein. Thorpe was a skilled broadcaster, and in addition to his television work he became a regular guest on the BBC radio programme &quot;Any Questions?&quot; In 1959 he was offered the post of chief commentator by Associated Rediffusion, but as the condition was that he gave up his parliamentary candidature, he declined.

Through the later 1950s Thorpe juggled his legal and television work with his political duties in North Devon, where he worked tirelessly to build up support. From September 1956 the Liberal Party was led by Jo Grimond, a more up-to-date figure than his elderly predecessor Davies, and more in tune with the ideas of Thorpe and the Radical Reform Group. After an uncertain beginning—the Liberals lost one of their six seats to Labour in a February 1957 by-election—Grimond&#x27;s leadership began to produce results. The party polled well in a series of by-elections during 1957 and 1958, culminating in a victory at Torrington in March 1958—a seat which the party had not contested in the 1955 general election. Thorpe, who had figured prominently in the Torrington campaign, saw this victory in an adjoining Devon constituency as a harbinger of his own future success.

Thorpe&#x27;s television and radio work had brought him a measure of celebrity, and his colourful and individualistic campaigning style was widely admired. The journalist Christopher Booker recalled: &quot;He had an extraordinary ability both to cheer up his followers and send up his opponents&quot;. Throughout the 1950s Thorpe was leading a secret homosexual life, at a time when all such activity was illegal in the United Kingdom, and subject to heavy penalties; exposure would have ended his political prospects instantly. This sexual orientation, concealed from the wider public, was known and tolerated in North Devon, and was at least suspected by many in the wider Liberal Party.

==Member of Parliament==
Thorpe&#x27;s efforts in North Devon came to fruition in the October 1959 general election, when he won the seat with a majority of 362 over his Conservative opponent—the Liberal Party&#x27;s solitary gain in what was generally an electoral triumph for Harold Macmillan&#x27;s Conservative government. On 10 November 1959, he made his maiden speech, during a debate on the government&#x27;s local employment bill. He highlighted poor communications as the principal reason for the lack of employment opportunities in North Devon, and called for urgent government action.

Thorpe was a diligent MP, active in promoting local issues—a new general hospital, and a link road to the Exeter-Taunton motorway—and campaigned successfully to save the Barnstaple-to-Exeter railway line from the &quot;Beeching axe&quot;. On broader questions he made no secret of his anti-hanging, pro-immigrant, pro-Europe opinions, largely not shared by his constituents. He championed freedom from colonial and minority rule, and was an outspoken opponent of regimes he considered oppressive such as those in South Africa and the short-lived Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. He was also noted for his verve and wit; when in 1962, after a series of by-election disasters, Macmillan sacked a third of his cabinet, Thorpe&#x27;s reported comment, an inversion of the biblical verse John 15:13, was &quot;Greater love hath no man than this, that he lay down his friends for his life&quot;.

Within the Liberal Party, Thorpe helped to found an informal organisation known as &quot;Winnable Seats&quot;, which directed energy and funding to selected target constituencies. This strategy led to some good by-election performances during 1961–62, culminating in March 1962 with victory in Orpington, where a 14,760 Conservative majority was turned into a Liberal majority of 7,855. These results were accompanied by substantial Liberal gains in municipal elections; national opinion polls briefly showed the party on equal terms with the Labour and Conservative parties. This advance was barely reflected in the results of the October 1964 general election; the party nearly doubled its share of the national vote, to 11.2%, but secured a net gain of only two seats. One of the new Liberals was Peter Bessell, who won the Cornish seat of Bodmin. In North Devon, Thorpe increased his personal majority to over 5,000.

After the election, which Labour won with a small majority, Thorpe was seen by many as Grimond&#x27;s natural successor; his speeches were generally the highlights of the party&#x27;s annual assemblies, and he strengthened his position when, in 1965, he secured the important post of party treasurer. He proved to be an excellent fund-raiser, although his insistence on personal control of much of the party&#x27;s funds aroused criticism and resentment. In July 1965, after the end of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, Thorpe toured Central and East Africa, visiting both Zambia and Rhodesia. On his return he advised the prime minister, Harold Wilson, that the all-white Rhodesian government under Ian Smith would make a unilateral declaration of independence (UDI) before the end of the year, unless deterred by the threat of armed intervention. Wilson would not countenance the use of troops; the UDI took place on 11 November. In a speech to the Liberal Assembly in September 1966, Thorpe condemned Wilson&#x27;s handling of the Rhodesia issue (&quot;misjudged and misplanned&quot;), and called for the bombing by United Nations aircraft of the rail link through which the post-UDI Rhodesian government received its oil supplies. The speech delighted the more radical elements in the Liberal Party but outraged many Conservatives, who used the derisive nickname &quot;Bomber Thorpe&quot; for the rest of Thorpe&#x27;s parliamentary career.

In March 1966 Wilson called an election, hoping to improve his tiny parliamentary majority. He did so, increasing it to almost 100. The Liberals, although their overall share of the vote fell to 8.5%, increased their number of MPs from nine to 12, an indication of success in targeted campaigning under the &quot;Winnable Seats&quot; strategy. Thorpe suffered a personal disappointment in North Devon, where his majority dropped to 1,166.

==Party leader==

===1967–1970===
Following the 1966 election, Grimond confided to senior party officials that he wished soon to step down from the leadership. Thorpe was now the senior Liberal MP after Grimond, and the party&#x27;s highest-profile member, although Tim Beaumont, chairman of the party&#x27;s organising committee, noted in his diary: &quot;I am pretty certain that he has little popularity within the Parliamentary Party&quot;. When Grimond finally resigned, on 17 January 1967, an election to replace him was arranged to take place within 48 hours, leaving little time for manoeuvring. The 12 Liberal MPs formed the whole electorate; after the first ballot, Thorpe had secured six votes against three each for Eric Lubbock, the Orpington MP, and Emlyn Hooson who had succeeded to the Montgomeryshire seat. On 18 January Lubbock and Hooson withdrew their candidacies, and Thorpe was declared the winner.

As Liberal leader, Thorpe provided a clear contrast with the pedestrian images of Wilson and Edward Heath, the Conservative leader since March 1965. He was considerably younger, and much more telegenic. His first years of leadership were problematic; he found himself at odds with the Young Liberals, who were advocating policies far to the left of the Liberal mainstream. Their demands for workers&#x27; control in nationalised industries, British withdrawal from NATO, and massive cuts in the defence budget, caused bitter disputes within the party and damaged its public image. At this time the political climate was not conducive to radical policies; the Wilson government&#x27;s rapid descent into unpopularity brought a sharp swing to the right among voters. The beneficiaries were the Conservatives, who made spectacular by-election gains at Labour&#x27;s expense while the Liberals failed to make any real impact. Discontent against Thorpe&#x27;s leadership was being voiced within a year of his election, culminating in June 1968 when disaffected senior party members combined with Young Liberals in an attempt to depose him. Thorpe had just married Caroline Allpass, and was abroad on honeymoon when the plotters struck. The timing of their attempted coup, widely seen in and out of the party as treachery, ensured that on Thorpe&#x27;s return the party executive backed him by 48 votes to 2.

Thorpe&#x27;s marriage provided him with a period of emotional stability; a son, Rupert, was born in April 1969. Shortly afterwards, Thorpe received a political boost when the Liberals unexpectedly won a by-election at Birmingham Ladywood, in a previously safe Labour seat. This was a solitary success, and the party faced the general election of June 1970 with little confidence. The results justified their gloomy premonitions; the party&#x27;s share of the vote fell to 7.5%, and seven of its thirteen seats, including Ladywood, were lost. Thorpe barely hung on in North Devon, his majority reduced to 369. Three of his colleagues had comparably small majorities; only Grimond, Hooson and Russell Johnston were relatively safe. Heath&#x27;s Conservatives secured a 30-seat majority.

===1970–1974===

Following the Liberals&#x27; poor election performance Thorpe came under fire, but such criticisms were stifled when, ten days after the election, Caroline Thorpe was killed in a car crash. For the rest of 1970 and for much of 1971, Thorpe was preoccupied with his loss and his plan for a permanent memorial to Caroline. Meanwhile, the party began to recover, chiefly through its adoption of &quot;community politics&quot;—engagement with local rather than national issues—and achieved modest gains in the 1971 local elections.

By early 1972, with the monument to Caroline erected on Codden Hill, Thorpe was fully re-engaged in political life. In February he assisted the passage through the House of Commons of Heath&#x27;s European Communities Bill, approving the United Kingdom&#x27;s accession to the European Economic Community. The bill was opposed by Labour and by some Conservatives. By aligning his party with the government, Thorpe ensured a majority of eight for the bill&#x27;s second reading, and it duly became law. By mid-1972 the Liberals&#x27; fortunes were rising significantly; the public was equally disenchanted with both major parties, and community politics were proving popular. Impressive local election results were followed by sensational by-election results. In October 1972 Rochdale was won from Labour, and in the next year four victories were achieved over the Conservatives: Sutton, Isle of Ely, Ripon and Berwick-upon-Tweed.

On 14 March 1973, Thorpe married Marion Stein, a concert pianist and the former wife of George Lascelles, 7th Earl of Harewood. The couple had been brought together a year earlier by a mutual acquaintance, the pianist Moura Lympany. The year ended less happily for Thorpe, when the secondary banking firm of London &amp; County Securities, of which he had been a director since May 1971, collapsed amid rumours of mismanagement and fraud, marking the start of the secondary banking crisis of 1973–1975; the details were not revealed until 1976. In February 1974, Heath, whose government had been plagued by industrial unrest, called a general election on the issue of &quot;Who governs Britain?&quot;. During the election campaign there was evidence of disaffection with both Heath and Wilson, and of a surge in Liberal support. Thorpe was confident that the party would make a significant breakthrough; on election day, 28 February, it secured its highest national vote to date, 6 million, and its highest share of the vote (19.3%) since 1929. Under the first-past-the-post voting system, these figures translated into just 14 seats. Thorpe&#x27;s majority in North Devon rose to 11,072.

===Coalition negotiations===

The February 1974 general election produced a hung parliament; neither Labour, with 301 seats, nor the Conservatives, with 297 seats, achieved an overall majority. As was his right as the sitting Prime Minister, Heath did not resign, hoping to persuade the Liberals into a Conservative-led coalition. He met Thorpe on 2 March to discuss possible bases for co-operation, Heath&#x27;s preferred option being a formal coalition in which Thorpe would be given a cabinet post, and junior ministries would be allocated to other senior Liberals. As the combined Conservative-Liberal vote amounted to 57% of the electorate, such a government would, Heath thought, have some moral legitimacy. If Thorpe would not accept coalition, a less formal basis of inter-party co-operation might be agreed which would enable the Conservative government to retain office.

The next day, following discussions with senior colleagues, Thorpe advised Heath that a commitment to electoral reform would be a prerequisite to any arrangement between the two parties. Thorpe proposed that Heath establish a Speaker&#x27;s Conference whose recommendations on electoral reform would, if acceptable to the Liberals, form the basis of subsequent legislation with full cabinet approval. Following further consultations with their parties, the two leaders met again; Heath reported that while his party would not object to a Speaker&#x27;s Conference, they could not commit themselves in advance to accepting its recommendations, which would be subject to a free House of Commons vote. This was unacceptable to Thorpe, who then made a separate proposal that an all-party &quot;Government of national unity&quot; be formed to tackle the urgent economic problems facing the country. This idea was rejected by Heath, who resigned on Monday 4 March.

Thorpe later admitted that a coalition agreement would have torn the party apart; the more radical elements, in particular the Young Liberals, would never have accepted it. Furthermore, Thorpe said that &quot;even with our support Heath wouldn&#x27;t have had a parliamentary majority&quot;; without some arrangements with the Scottish Nationalists or the Ulster Unionists, the coalition could have been brought down by the first vote on the Queen&#x27;s Speech. Following Heath&#x27;s resignation, Wilson formed a Labour minority government.

===Declining fortunes===
As Harold Wilson did not have an overall majority after the February 1974 election, he was widely expected to call another election before too long; he did so in September 1974. Thorpe anticipated a turning point in the Liberals&#x27; fortunes and campaigned under the slogan &quot;one more heave&quot;, aiming for a complete breakthrough with entering a coalition a last resort. The phrase is attributed to advertising agent and Liberal parliamentary candidate Adrian Slade. Future Liberal Party leader David Steel called the whole campaign &quot;a slightly less successful re-run of February.&quot; In the October 1974 general election, the Liberals received over 700,000 fewer votes and returned 13 MPs, down one, with Wilson achieving an overall majority of three.

Thorpe and the Liberals were deflated by the outcome of the October 1974 election. Wilson&#x27;s majority, albeit slim, denied Thorpe the role of kingmaker, leaving the Liberals without a clear role; as Dutton observes, apart from being neither Conservative or Labour, the Liberals lacked a distinctive identity and their policies were largely unknown to the public. A further problem for the party was the divergence between its activists, who were radicals well to the left of the official party, and a large section of its recent supporters who were disgruntled Conservatives. Thorpe, whose personal majority in North Devon had fallen to under 7,000 in October, confided to an associate that, unless the party were soon to make a significant impact, his days as leader might be numbered.

During 1975 Thorpe campaigned for electoral reform, citing the &quot;Great Vote Robbery&quot; of the year before. He argued that electoral reform on a proportional basis would bring about a centrist stability to British politics that would favour British business. In the June 1975 referendum on the UK&#x27;s continuing membership of the EEC, Thorpe campaigned for a &quot;yes&quot; vote alongside the pro-Europeans of both major parties, appearing with Heath (recently replaced as Conservative leader by Margaret Thatcher) at the Oxford Union. The referendum resulted in a two-to-one approval of the UK&#x27;s membership, but Thorpe failed to stem the decline in his party&#x27;s electoral fortunes. In the Woolwich West by-election on 26 June 1975 the party lost more than two-thirds of its October 1974 vote, a &quot;major humiliation&quot; according to &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

===Relationship with Norman Scott===

Thorpe&#x27;s homosexual activities from time to time came to the attention of the authorities, and were investigated by the police; information was added to his MI5 file, but in no case was action taken against him. In 1971 he survived a party inquiry after a complaint against him by Norman Scott, a riding instructor and would-be model. Scott maintained that in the early 1960s he had been in a sexual relationship with Thorpe, who had subsequently mistreated him. The inquiry dismissed the allegations, but the danger represented by Scott continued to preoccupy Thorpe who, according to his confidant David Holmes, felt &quot;he would never be safe with that man around&quot;.

Scott (known then as Norman Josiffe) had first met Thorpe early in 1961 when the former was a 20-year-old groom working for one of Thorpe&#x27;s wealthy friends. The initial meeting was brief, but nearly a year later Scott, by then in London and destitute, called at the House of Commons to ask the MP for help. Thorpe later acknowledged that a friendship had developed, but denied any physical relationship; Scott claimed that he had been seduced by Thorpe on the night following the Commons meeting. Over the following years Thorpe made numerous attempts to help Scott find accommodation and work, but Scott became increasingly resentful towards Thorpe, threatening him with exposure.

In 1965 Thorpe asked his parliamentary colleague Peter Bessell to help him resolve the problem. Bessell met Scott and warned him that his threats against Thorpe might be considered blackmail; he offered to help Scott obtain a new National Insurance card, the lack of which had been a long-running source of irritation. This quietened matters for a while, but within a year Scott came calling again. With Thorpe&#x27;s agreement, Bessell began paying Scott a &quot;retainer&quot; of £5 a week (), supposedly as compensation for the welfare benefits that Scott had been unable to obtain because of his missing card. Bessell later stated that by 1968 Thorpe was considering ways in which Scott might be permanently silenced; he thought David Holmes might organise this. Holmes had been best man at Thorpe&#x27;s wedding, and was completely loyal to him.

When Scott unexpectedly married, on 13 May 1969, it appeared that the problem might be over, but by 1970 the marriage had ended. Early in 1971 Scott moved to the village of Tal-y-bont, in North Wales, where he befriended a widow, Gwen Parry-Jones, to whom he recounted his tale of ill-treatment at the hands of Thorpe. She passed the information to Emlyn Hooson, who was MP for the adjoining Welsh constituency; Hooson precipitated the party inquiry which cleared Thorpe. After Parry-Jones&#x27;s death the following year, Scott fell into a depression and for a while was quiescent. In time, he began to tell his story to anyone who would listen. By 1974 Thorpe, at the crest of the Liberal revival, was terrified of exposure that might lose him the Liberal leadership. As Dominic Sandbrook observes in his history of the times: &quot;The stakes had never been higher; silencing Scott had never been more urgent&quot;.

===Resignation===

Over the years Scott made several attempts to publicise his story, but no newspapers were interested. The satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot; decided in late 1972 that the story &quot;was defamatory, unproveable, and above all was ten years old&quot;. From late 1974 Holmes took the lead in furthering plans to silence Scott; through various intermediaries he found Andrew Newton, an airline pilot, who said he would dispose of Scott for a fee of between £5,000 and £10,000. Meanwhile, Thorpe procured £20,000 from Sir Jack Hayward (), the Bahamas-based millionaire businessman who had previously donated to the Liberal Party, stating that this was to cover election expenses incurred during 1974. Thorpe arranged for these funds to be secretly channelled to Holmes rather than the party. He later denied that this money had been used to pay Newton, or anyone else, as part of a conspiracy.

In October 1975 Newton made a bungled attempt to shoot Scott that resulted in the killing of Scott&#x27;s Great Dane Rinka. Newton was arrested on charges of possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life, yet the press remained muted, possibly awaiting the bigger story that they hoped would break. Their reticence ended in January 1976 when Scott, in court on a minor social security fraud charge, claimed he was being hounded because of his previous sexual relationship with Thorpe. This statement, made in court and thus protected from the libel laws, was widely reported.

On 29 January the Department of Trade published its report into the collapse of London &amp; County Securities. The report criticised Thorpe&#x27;s failure to investigate the true nature of the company before involving himself, &quot;a cautionary tale for any leading politician&quot;. Thorpe received some relief when his former colleague Peter Bessell, who had resigned from parliament and relocated to California to escape from a string of business failures, re-emerged in early February after discovery by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. Bessell gave muddled accounts of his involvement with Scott but insisted that his former chief was innocent of any wrongdoing.

On 16 March 1976 Newton&#x27;s trial began at Exeter Crown Court, where Scott repeated his allegations against Thorpe despite the efforts of the prosecution&#x27;s lawyers to silence him. Newton was found guilty and sentenced to two years&#x27; imprisonment, but did not incriminate Thorpe. The erosion of public support for the Liberal Party continued with several poor by-election results in March, which the former leader Grimond attributed to increasing lack of confidence in Thorpe. On 14 March, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; printed Thorpe&#x27;s answer to Scott&#x27;s various allegations, under the heading &quot;The Lies of Norman Scott&quot;. Nevertheless, many of the party&#x27;s senior figures now felt that Thorpe should resign.

Thorpe&#x27;s problems multiplied when Bessell, alarmed by his own position, confessed to the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; on 6 May that in his earlier statements he had lied to protect his former leader. Scott was threatening to publish personal letters from Thorpe who, to forestall him, arranged for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; to print two letters from 1961. Although these did not conclusively indicate wrongdoing, their tone indicated that Thorpe had not been frank about the true nature of his friendship with Scott. On 10 May 1976, amid rising criticism, Thorpe resigned the party leadership, &quot;convinced that a fixed determination to destroy the Leader could itself result in the destruction of the Party&quot;.

==Post-resignation==

===Interlude===

Thorpe&#x27;s resignation brought him a period of temporary calm. The new Liberal leader, David Steel, made him party spokesman on foreign affairs, with responsibility for European issues. Wilson had by this time retired as prime minister, and been replaced by James Callaghan. Thorpe lobbied the government hard for legislation to introduce direct elections to the European Parliament; at that time MEPs were appointed by member nations&#x27; parliaments.

By-election losses eroded and finally removed Labour&#x27;s small parliamentary majority, and in March 1977 Callaghan was in danger of losing a confidence vote that would have precipitated a general election. Opinion polls indicated that an election at that time would have been equally disastrous for the Labour and Liberal parties; to ensure mutual survival, a &quot;Lib–Lab pact&quot; was agreed, whereby in return for certain policy concessions the Liberals would support the Government. Thorpe used his influence to insist that legislation for direct elections to the European Parliament was part of the pact, but was unable to secure his principal objective, a commitment to a proportional basis in these elections. In parliament, Thorpe spoke in favour of Scottish and Welsh devolution, arguing that there was no alternative to home rule except total separation. In the various debates related to the unresolved issue of Rhodesia, Thorpe pressed for the involvement of representatives from the African nationalists, in the form of the Patriotic Front, in negotiations for a peaceful settlement to the long-running Rhodesian Bush War.

Although the press was generally quiet following Thorpe&#x27;s resignation, reporters were still investigating him. The most persistent of these were Barry Penrose and Roger Courtiour, collectively known as &quot;Pencourt&quot;, who had begun by believing that Thorpe was a target of South African intelligence agencies, until their investigations led them to Bessell in California. Bessell, no longer covering for Thorpe, gave the reporters his version of the conspiracy to murder Scott, and Thorpe&#x27;s role in it. Pencourt&#x27;s progress was covered in &quot;Private Eye&quot;, to Thorpe&#x27;s extreme vexation; when the pair attempted to question him outside his Devon home early in 1977, he threatened them with prosecution.

Thorpe&#x27;s relatively peaceful interlude ended in October 1977 when Newton, released from prison, sold his story to the London &quot;Evening News&quot;. Newton&#x27;s claim that he had been paid &quot;by a leading Liberal&quot; to kill Scott caused a sensation, and led to a prolonged police investigation. Throughout this period Thorpe endeavoured to continue his public life, in and out of parliament. In the House of Commons on 1 August 1978, when it appeared certain he would face criminal charges, he asked the Attorney-General what sum of capital possessed by an applicant would prevent him from receiving legal aid. The next day he made his final speech in the House, during a debate on Rhodesia.

On 4 August, Thorpe, along with Holmes and two of Holmes&#x27;s associates, was charged with conspiracy to murder Scott. Thorpe was additionally charged with incitement to murder, on the basis of his alleged 1968 discussions with Bessell and Holmes. After being released on bail, Thorpe declared his innocence and his determination to refute the charges. Although he remained North Devon&#x27;s MP he withdrew almost completely from public view, except for a brief theatrical appearance at the Liberals&#x27; 1978 annual assembly on 14 September—to the annoyance of the party&#x27;s leaders who had asked him to stay away.

===Committal, electoral defeat===

In November 1978, Thorpe, Holmes and two of the latter&#x27;s business acquaintances, John le Mesurier (a carpet salesman, not to be confused with the actor of that name) and George Deakin, appeared before magistrates at Minehead, Somerset, in a committal hearing to determine whether they should stand trial. The court heard evidence of a conspiracy from Scott, Newton and Bessell; it also learned that Bessell was being paid £50,000 by &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; for his story. At the conclusion, the four defendants were committed for trial at the Old Bailey. This was set to begin on 30 April 1979, but when in March the government fell, and a general election was called for 3 May, the trial was postponed until 8 May.

Thorpe accepted the invitation of his local party to fight the North Devon seat, against the advice of friends who were certain he would lose. His campaign was largely ignored by the national party; of its leading figures only John Pardoe, the MP for North Cornwall, visited the constituency. Thorpe, supported by his wife, his mother and some loyal friends, fought hard, although much of his characteristic vigour was missing. He lost to his Conservative opponent by 8,500 votes. Overall, the Conservatives obtained a majority of 43 seats, and Margaret Thatcher became prime minister. The Liberal Party&#x27;s share of the national vote fell to 13.8%, and its total seats from 13 to 11. Dutton attributes much of the fall in the Liberal vote to the lengthy adverse publicity generated by the Thorpe affair.

==Trial and acquittal==

The trial, which lasted for six weeks, began on 8 May 1979, before Mr Justice Cantley. Thorpe was defended by George Carman. Carman quickly undermined Bessell&#x27;s credibility by revealing that he had a significant interest in Thorpe&#x27;s conviction; in the event of an acquittal, Bessell would receive only half of his newspaper fee. During his cross-examination of Scott on 22 May, Carman asked: &quot;You knew Thorpe to be a man of homosexual tendencies in 1961?&quot; This oblique admission of his client&#x27;s sexuality was a stratagem to prevent the prosecution from calling witnesses who would testify to Thorpe&#x27;s sex life. Nevertheless, Carman insisted, there was no reliable evidence of any physical sexual relationship between Thorpe and Scott, whom Carman dismissed as &quot;this inveterate liar, social climber and scrounger&quot;.

After weeks in which the court heard the prosecution&#x27;s evidence from the committal hearings, the defence opened on 7 June. Deakin testified that although he introduced Newton to Holmes, he had thought that this was to help deal with a blackmailer—he knew nothing of a conspiracy to kill. Deakin was the only defendant to testify; Thorpe and the others chose to remain silent and call no witnesses, on the basis that the testimonies of Bessell, Scott and Newton had failed to make the prosecution&#x27;s case.

On 18 June, following closing speeches from prosecution and defence counsel, the judge began his summing-up. While emphasising Thorpe&#x27;s distinguished public record, he was scathing about the principal prosecution witnesses: Bessell was a &quot;humbug&quot;, Scott a fraud, a sponger, a whiner, a parasite—&quot;but of course he could still be telling the truth.&quot; Newton was &quot;determined to milk the case as hard as he can.&quot; On 20 June the jury retired; they returned two days later and acquitted the four defendants on all charges. In a brief public statement, Thorpe said that he considered the verdict &quot;a complete vindication.&quot; Scott said he was &quot;unsurprised&quot; by the outcome but was upset by the aspersions on his character made by the judge from the safety of the bench.

==Later life==
Following his acquittal, Thorpe announced that he proposed to attend the 1979 Liberal assembly and the forthcoming Liberal International Congress in Canada. His failure to explain himself under oath was widely criticised in the press, and the public perception was that he had been fortunate to have &quot;got off&quot;. Reluctantly, Thorpe accepted that there was no future role for him within the Liberal Party, and informed the North Devon association that he would not seek to fight the seat again. Steel expressed the hope that Thorpe would, &quot;after a suitable period of rest and recuperation ... find many avenues where his great talents may be used.&quot;

In his search for a new career Thorpe applied unsuccessfully for the posts of administrator of the Aldeburgh Festival, and race relations adviser to the Greater London Council. His attempts to restart a career in television also came to nothing. In February 1982, it was announced that he was to become director of the British section of Amnesty International, but the appointment was opposed by many of the organisation&#x27;s membership, and he withdrew from the post after a month of controversy. He kept his position as chairman of the political committee of the United Nations Association, but in 1985 the progression of Parkinson&#x27;s disease, which had first been diagnosed in 1979, led to the curtailment of most of his public activity. He continued to live in North Devon, and in 1987 accepted the honorary presidency of the North Devon Liberal Democrat association, formed after the Liberal–SDP merger. He thought he might return to parliament via a life peerage in the House of Lords, but although friends lobbied on his behalf, the merged party&#x27;s leadership refused to recommend him. Within the party generally, feelings towards him warmed, and when he attended the 1997 annual conference he received a standing ovation.
In 1999 Thorpe published an anecdotal memoir, &quot;In My Own Time&quot;, an anthology of his experiences in public life. In the book he repeated his denial of any sexual relationship with Scott, and maintained that the decision not to offer evidence was made to avoid prolonging the trial, since it was clear that the prosecution&#x27;s case was &quot;shot through with lies, inaccuracies and admissions&quot;. In the 2005 general election campaign Thorpe appeared on television, attacking both the Conservative and Labour parties for supporting the Iraq War. Three years later, in 2008, he gave interviews to &quot;The Guardian&quot; and to the &quot;Journal of Liberal History&quot;. York Membery, the Liberal journal&#x27;s interviewer, found Thorpe able to communicate only in a barely audible whisper, but with his brain power unimpaired. Thorpe asserted that he &quot;still had steam in my pipes&quot;; reviewing the current political situation, he considered the Labour prime minister Gordon Brown &quot;dour and unimpressive&quot;, and dubbed the Conservative leader David Cameron &quot;a phoney ... a Thatcherite trying to appear progressive&quot;. Some of Thorpe&#x27;s pro-Europeanism had been eroded over the years; in his final years, he thought that the European Union had become too powerful, and insufficiently accountable.

==Final years and death==
Thorpe&#x27;s last public appearance was in 2009, at the unveiling of a bust of himself in the Grimond Room at the House of Commons. Thereafter he was confined to his home, nursed by Marion until she became too infirm. She died on 6 March 2014; Thorpe survived for nine more months, dying from complications of Parkinson&#x27;s disease on 4 December, aged 85. His funeral was at St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster, on 17 December.

==Appraisal==
Most assessments of Thorpe&#x27;s career emphasise his downfall rather than his political achievements, &quot;a fall unparalleled in British political history&quot;, according to the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; obituarist. While Thorpe hoped that acquittal would ensure he would be remembered primarily for his revival of Liberal fortunes in the 1960s and 1970s, the trial shattered his reputation irretrievably. The prosecuting counsel at the Old Bailey likened the case to &quot;a tragedy of truly Greek or Shakespearian proportions—the slow but inevitable destruction of a man by the stamp of one defect.&quot;

After Thorpe&#x27;s death, sympathetic commentators drew attention to his internationalism and social liberalism, highlighting his long involvement with the Anti-Apartheid Movement, his denunciations of dictators, his opposition to the death penalty, and his rejection of racism. There is wide agreement that he was an outstanding political campaigner—persuasive, witty, and warm: &quot;his astonishing memory for faces persuaded voters that they were intimate friends ... his resourceful mind afforded quips and stunts for every occasion.&quot; A different perspective on Thorpe, quoted by Michael Bloch, was given by a former friend, the art expert David Carritt, at the time of the trial: &quot;Self-centred ...&quot;Mildly&quot; entertaining, slightly sinister. Said to be witty, but ... if one doesn&#x27;t care for impersonations, he&#x27;s really a bit of a bore&quot;.

In assessing Thorpe&#x27;s 10 years as party leader, Nick Clegg credited him with providing &quot;the driving force that continued the Liberal revival that began under Jo Grimond&quot;, and Douglas Murray, writing for &quot;The Spectator&quot;, recognised his strategy of identifying and concentrating on winnable seats as the basis for the major Liberal Democrat breakthrough in the 1997 election. Dutton, in his party history, took a more qualified view, suggesting that in spite of Thorpe&#x27;s bold style and charisma, &quot;the party drifted without a sense of conviction and underlying purpose ... [and was] dominated by tactics rather than ideas&quot;. Thorpe positioned the Liberals in the &quot;moderate centre&quot;, equidistant from Labour and Conservative, a strategy which was very successful in February 1974 when dissatisfaction with the two main parties was at its height, but which left the party&#x27;s specific identity obscure, and its policies largely unknown.

The political journalist Andrew Rawnsley described Thorpe as a &quot;dandy, exhibitionist, superb showman, shallow thinker, wit and mimic, cunning opportunist, sinister intriguer, idealistic internationalist and a man with a clandestine homosexual life&quot;. Thorpe never discussed his sexuality publicly, although throughout his political career he led a double life—responsible politician by day while, according to Murray, &quot;by night he was not only very gay but rather carefree about being so.&quot; The writer and broadcaster Jonathan Fryer, who was a gay activist within the Liberal Party in the 1970s, maintained that in the repressive climate of the time Thorpe &quot;couldn&#x27;t have come out, even if he&#x27;d wanted to&quot;. His double standard irritated and alienated the gay Liberals: &quot;He wanted the best of both worlds—his fun and a family.&quot;

In his review of Michael Bloch&#x27;s biography, Murray writes: &quot;Jeremy Thorpe had hoped to be remembered as a great political leader. I suppose they all do. And perhaps he will be remembered longer than many other politicians of his age or ours. But it will always be for the same thing. Jeremy, Jeremy, bang, bang, woof, woof.&quot;

==In popular media==
In 2009 the BBC attempted to film a TV biopic of Thorpe&#x27;s life, with Rupert Everett in the title role, but this was subsequently abandoned after legal threats from Thorpe. &quot;A Very English Scandal&quot;, a true crime account covering the Thorpe/Scott affair, by John Preston, was published on 5 May 2016 by Viking Press. The book was described as &quot;a political thriller, with urgent dialogue, well-staged scenes, escalating tension and plenty of cliffhangers, especially once the trial begins&quot;. A British three-part television series, also titled &quot;A Very English Scandal&quot;, based on Preston&#x27;s book, aired on the BBC in May 2018, directed by Stephen Frears, with actor Hugh Grant starring as Thorpe and Ben Whishaw as Norman Scott. Adam Macqueen&#x27;s counterfactual thriller &quot;Beneath the Streets&quot;, longlisted for the 2021 Polari Prize, is a fictionalised retelling of the Thorpe affair in which the Liberal leader succeeds in killing Scott.

<text>Ruud Janssen (born 29 July 1959 in Tilburg) is a Dutch Fluxus and mail artist currently living in Breda in the Netherlands.

==Life and Work==
Janssen studied physics and mathematics before he became active with mail art in 1980, doing several international mail art projects. From 1994 till 2001 he conducted interviews with Fluxus and mail artists. In later years, Janssen focused on acrylic painting and individual correspondences.

Janssen was selected to publish an essay as one of eleven contemporary &quot;New Fluxus&quot; artists who are seen to &#x27;inhabit the site of Fluxus, developing and interpreting the Fluxus tradition in a new way.&#x27; in a special double issue of the journal &quot;Visible Language&quot; on Fluxus.

In 1994, Janssen began a series of mail-interviews. He interviewed Fluxus and mail art personalities by using all the communication-forms that were available (fax, e-mail, envelope, personal meeting, telephone). The question traveled by one form and the answer could be sent back in another form. This concept resulted in a series of mail-interviews. These interviews were published in booklet-form and the complete texts are also available online. In 2008, a selection of the mail-interviews were published in book form.

In 1997 Janssen had a solo exhibition of his mail art work and interviews in Guy Bleus&#x27; &quot;E-Mail Art Archives&quot; (Provincial Center for Visual Arts, now Z33) in Hasselt, Belgium.

==TAM-Publications==
Janssen publishes articles, magazines and booklets with his TAM-Publications and participates in international mail art projects, collaborations and exhibitions.

==International Union of Mail-Artists==
He founded IUOMA (International Union of Mail-Artists) in 1988 and is also the curator of the &quot;TAM-Rubberstamp Archive&quot;, the result of a Mail Art collection that has been accumulated by him from 1983 till now. The archive contains art prints, original rubber stamps, magazines and literature.

==Fluxus Heidelberg Center==
In 2003 Janssen and Litsa Spathi founded the Fluxus Heidelberg Center for which they are building up a collection of Fluxus material and where they also publish their own works.

<text>Mail art, also known as postal art and correspondence art, is an artistic movement centered on sending small-scale works through the postal service. It developed out of what eventually became Ray Johnson&#x27;s New York Correspondence School and the Fluxus movements of the 1960s. It has since developed into a global, ongoing movement.

==Characteristics==

Media commonly used in mail art include postcards, paper, a collage of found or recycled images and objects, rubber stamps, artist-created stamps (called artistamps), and paint, but can also include music, sound art, poetry, or anything that can be put in an envelope and sent via post. Mail art is considered art once it is dispatched. Mail artists regularly call for thematic or topical mail art for use in (often unjuried) exhibition.

Mail artists appreciate interconnection with other artists. The art form promotes an egalitarian way of creating that frequently circumvents official art distribution and approval systems such as the art market, museums, and galleries. Mail artists rely on their alternative &quot;outsider&quot; network as the primary way of sharing their work, rather than being dependent on the ability to locate and secure exhibition space.

Mail art can be seen as anticipating the cyber communities founded on the Internet.

==History==
Artist Edward M. Plunkett has argued that communication-as-art-form is an ancient tradition; he posits (tongue in cheek) that mail art began when Cleopatra had herself delivered to Julius Caesar in a rolled-up carpet.

===Ray Johnson, New York Correspondance School, and Fluxus===
The American artist Ray Johnson is considered to be the first mail artist. Johnson&#x27;s experiments with art in the mail began in 1943, while the posting of instructions and soliciting of activity from his recipients began in the mid-1950s with the mailing of his &quot;moticos&quot;, and thus provided mail art with a blueprint for the free exchange of art via post.

The term &quot;mail art&quot; was coined in the 1960s. In 1962, Plunkett coined the term &quot;New York Correspondence School&quot; to refer to Johnson&#x27;s activities; Johnson adopted this moniker but sometimes intentionally misspelled it as &quot;correspondance&quot;. The deliberate misspelling was characteristic of the playful spirit of the Correspondance School and its actions.

Most of the Correspondance School members are fairly obscure, and the letters they sent, often featuring simple drawings or stickers, often instructed the recipient to perform some fairly simple action. Johnson&#x27;s work consists primarily of letters, often with the addition of doodles and rubber stamped messages, which he mailed to friends and acquaintances. The Correspondance School was a network of individuals who were artists by virtue of their willingness to play along and appreciate Johnson&#x27;s sense of humor. One example of the activities of the Correspondance School consisted in calling meetings of fan clubs, such as one devoted to the actress Anna May Wong. Many of Johnson&#x27;s missives to his network featured a hand drawn version of what became a personal logo or alter-ego, a bunny head.

In a 1968 interview, Johnson explained that he found mailed correspondence interesting because of the limits it puts on the usual back and forth interaction and negotiation that comprises communication between individuals. Correspondence is &quot;a way to convey a message or a kind of idea to someone which is not verbal; it is not a confrontation of two people. It&#x27;s an object which is opened in privacy, probably, and the message is looked at ... You look at the object and, depending on your degree of interest, it very directly gets across to you what is there&quot;.

In 1970, Johnson and Marcia Tucker organized The New York Correspondence School Exhibition at the Whitney Museum in New York, which was the first significant public exhibition of the mail art genre.

On April 5, 1973, Johnson declared the &quot;death&quot; of the New York Correspondance School in an unpublished letter to the Obituary Department of &quot;The New York Times&quot; and in copies that he circulated to his network. However, he continued to practice mail art even after this.

Although much of Johnson&#x27;s work was initially given away, this hasn&#x27;t prevented it from attaining a market value. Andy Warhol is quoted as saying he &quot;would pay ten dollars for anything by Johnson.&quot;

In his 1973 diagram showing the development and scope of Fluxus, George Maciunas included mail art among the activities pursued by the Fluxus artist Robert Filliou. Filliou coined the term the &quot;Eternal Network&quot; that has become synonymous with mail art. Other Fluxus artists have been involved since the early 1960s in the creation of artist&#x27;s postage stamps (Robert Watts, Stamp Dispenser, 1963), postcards (Ben Vautier, The Postman&#x27;s Choice, 1965: a postcard with a different address on each side) and other works connected to the postal medium. Indeed, the mail art network counts many Fluxus members among its earliest participants. While Johnson did not consider himself directly as a member of the Fluxus school, his interests and attitudes were consistent with those of a number of Fluxus artists.

===1970s and 1980s===
In the 1970s, the practice of mail art grew considerably, providing a cheap and flexible channel of expression for cultural outsiders. In Canada, the artist collectives Image Bank and General Idea have been heralded as instrumental to the early history of networking and social interaction as art. Correspondence Art was particularly widespread where state censorship prevented a free circulation of alternative ideas, as in certain countries behind the Iron Curtain or in South America.

The growth of a sizable mail art community, with friendships born out of personal correspondence and, increasingly, mutual visits, led in the 1980s to the organization of several festivals, meetings and conventions where networkers could meet, socialize, perform, exhibit and plan further collaborations. Among these events were the Inter Dada Festivals organized in California in the early 1980s and the Decentralized Mail Art Congress of 1986.

In 1984 curator Ronny Cohen organized an exhibition for the Franklin Furnace, New York, called &quot;Mail Art Then and Now.&quot; The exhibition was to have an historical aspect as well as showing new mail art, and to mediate the two aspects Cohen edited the material sent to Franklin Furnace, breaking an unwritten but commonly accepted custom that all works submitted must be shown. The intent to edit, interpreted as censorship, resulted in a two-part panel discussion sponsored by Artists Talk on Art (organized by mail artist Carlo Pittore and moderated by art critic Robert C. Morgan) in February of that year, where Cohen and the mail artists were to debate the issues.

The night preceding the second panel on February 24, Carlo Pittore, John P. Jacob, Chuck Welch a.k.a. CrackerJack Kid, David Cole, and John Held Jr. crafted a statement asking Cohen to step down as the panel moderator. Welch delivered the statement whereby Cohen was asked to remain on the panel but forfeit her right to serve as moderator. Instead of remaining, Cohen chose to leave the event. After some give and take with both panelists and audience, Cohen left, saying, &quot;Have fun, boys.&quot; Her entourage walked out with her during the ensuing melee.

The excluded works were ultimately added to the exhibition by the staff of the Franklin Furnace, but the events surrounding it and the panels revealed ideological rifts within the mail art community. Simultaneously fanning the flames and documenting the extent to which it was already dominated by a small, mostly male, coterie of artists, the discussions were transcribed and published by panelist John P. Jacob in his short-lived mail art zine PostHype. In a letter to panelist Mark Bloch, Ray Johnson (who was not a panelist) commented on the reverse-censorship and sexism of the event.

The rise of mail art meetings and congresses during the late 80s, and the articulation of various &quot;isms&quot; proclaimed by their founders as movements within mail art, were in part a response to fractures made visible by the events surrounding the Franklin Furnace exhibition. Even if &quot;tourism&quot; was proposed satirically as a new movement by , a Swiss mail artist who was one of the organizers of the 1986 Mail Art Congress, nevertheless mail art in its pure form would continue to function without the personal meeting between so-called networkers.

In the mid-1980s, Fricker and Bloch, in a bilingual &quot;Open Letter To Everybody in the Network&quot; stated, &quot;1) An important function of the exhibitions and other group projects in the network is: to open channels to other human beings. 2) After your exhibition is shown and the documentation sent, or after you have received such a documentation with a list of addresses, &quot;use the channels&quot;! 3) Create person-to-person correspondence... 4) You have your own unique energy which you can give to others through your work: visual audio, verbal, etc. 5) This energy is best used when it is exchanged for energy from another person with the same intentions. 6) the power of the network is in the quality of the direct correspondence, not the quantity.&quot; The manifesto concludes, &quot;We have learned this from our own mistakes.&quot;

===1990s and the impact of the Internet era===
In 1994, Dutch mail artist Ruud Janssen began a series of mail-interviews which became an influential contribution in the field of mail art.

By the 1990s, mail art&#x27;s peak in terms of global postal activities had been reached, and mail artists, aware of increasing postal rates, were beginning the gradual migration of collective art projects towards the web and new, cheaper forms of digital communication. The Internet facilitated faster dissemination of mail art calls (invitations) and precipitated the involvement of newcomers.

==Philosophy and norms of the mail artist network==
In spite of the many links and similarities between historical avant-garde, alternative art practices (visual poetry, copy art, artist&#x27;s books) and mail art, one aspect that distinguishes the creative postal network from other artistic movements, schools, or groups (including Fluxus) is the way it disregards and circumvents the commercial art market. Any person with access to a mailbox can participate in the postal network and exchange free artworks, and each mail artist is free to decide how and when to answer (or not answer) a piece of incoming mail. Participants are invited by network members to take part in collective projects or unjuried exhibitions in which entries are not selected or judged. While contributions may be solicited around a particular theme, work to a required size, or sent in by a deadline, mail art generally operates within a spirit of &quot;anything goes.&quot;

The mail art philosophy of openness and inclusion is exemplified by the &quot;rules&quot; included in invitations (calls) to postal projects: a mail art show has no jury, no entry fee, there is no censorship, and all works are exhibited. The original contributions are not to be returned and remain the property of the organizers, but a catalogue or documentation is sent free to all the participants in exchange for their works. Although these rules are sometimes stretched, they have generally held up for four decades, with only minor dissimilarities and adjustments, like the occasional requests to avoid works of explicit sexual nature, calls for projects with specific participants, or the recent trend to display digital documentation on blogs and websites instead of personally sending printed paper to contributors.
Mail art has been exhibited in alternative spaces such as private apartments, municipal buildings, and shop windows, as well as in galleries and museums worldwide. Mail art shows, periodicals, and projects represent the &quot;public&quot; side of postal networking, a practice that has at its core the direct and private interaction between the individual participants. Mail artists value the process of exchanging ideas and the sense of belonging to a global community that is able to maintain a peaceful collaboration beyond differences of language, religion and ideology; this is one aspect that differentiates the mail art network from the world of commercial picture postcards and of simply &quot;mailed art.&quot;

A mail artist may have hundreds of correspondents from many different countries, or build a smaller core circle of favorite contacts. Mail art is widely practiced in Europe, North and South America, Russia, and Australia with smaller numbers of participants also in Africa, and China. In addition to being kept by the recipient, mail art archives have attracted the interest of libraries, archives, museums, and private collectors. Or, the works may be &#x27;worked into&#x27; and recycled back to the sender or to another networker.
Ray Johnson suggested (with a pun) that &quot;mail art has no history, only a present&quot;, and mail artists have followed his playful attitude in creating their own mythologies. Parody art movements like neoism and plagiarism have challenged notions of originality, as have the shared pseudonymous names Monty Cantsin and Karen Eliot, which were proposed for serial use by anyone. Semi-fictional organizations have been set up and virtual lands invented, imaginary countries for which artistamps are issued. Furthermore, attempts have been made to document and define the history of a complex and underestimated phenomenon that has spanned five decades. Various essays, graduate theses, guides and anthologies of mail art writings have appeared in print and on the Internet, often written by veteran networkers. A sub-group of envelope art has its genesis in the Grateful Dead Ticket Service. Looking to help their fans avoid the high fees that are generated by national ticket services the Grateful Dead started their own service, commonly referred to as mail order. At some point fans started decorating their envelopes with art. Some for art&#x27;s sake, others to grab the attention of the people that dole out tickets in hope of better seats.

==Media and artistic practices in the creation of mail artworks==

Because the democratic ethos of mail art is one of inclusion, both in terms of participants (&#x27;anyone who can afford the postage&#x27;) and in the scope of art forms, a broad range of media are employed in creation of mail artworks. Certain materials and techniques are commonly used and frequently favored by mail artists due to their availability, convenience, and ability to produce copies.

===Rubberstamps and artistamps===
Mail art has adopted and appropriated several of graphic forms already associated with the postal system. The rubber stamp officially used for franking mail, already utilized by Dada and Fluxus artists, has been embraced by mail artists who, in addition to reusing ready-made rubber stamps, have them professionally made to their own designs. They also carve into erasers with linocut tools to create handmade ones. These unofficial rubber stamps, whether disseminating mail artists&#x27; messages or simply announcing the identity of the sender, help to transform regular postcards into artworks and make envelopes an important part of the mail art experience.
Mail art has also appropriated the postage stamp as a format for individual expression. Inspired by the example of Cinderella stamps and Fluxus faux-stamps, the artistamp has spawned a vibrant sub-network of artists dedicated to creating and exchanging their own stamps and stamp sheets. Artist Jerry Dreva of the conceptual art group Les Petits Bonbons created a set of stamps and sent them to David Bowie who then used them as the inspiration for the cover of the single &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; released in 1980. Artistamps and rubber stamps, have become important staples of mail artworks, particularly in the enhancement of postcards and envelopes. The most important anthology of rubberstamp art was published by the artist Hervé Fischer in his book &quot;Art and Marginal Communication&quot;, Balland, Paris, 1974 – in French, English and German, to note also the catalog of the exhibition &quot;Timbres d&#x27;artistes&quot;, Published of Musée de la Poste, Paris, 1993, organized by the French artist Jean-Noël Laszlo – in French, English. Recently, an extensive compilation of artistamp artists was featured in 40 issues of the Artistamp Review. It was published by artist Adam Roussopoulos from 2019 through May 2024. Many notable artists were featured in the review including Jas Felter, E.F. Higgins III, John Held Jr., Michael Leigh, Chuck Welch, Vittore Baroni, and H.R. Fricker.

===Envelopes===
Some mail artists lavish more attention on the envelopes than the contents within. Painted envelopes are one-of-a-kind artworks with the handwritten address becoming part of the work. Stitching, embossing and an array of drawing materials can all be found on postcards, envelopes and on the contents inside.

===Printing and copying===
Printing is suited to mail artists who distribute their work widely. Various printmaking techniques, in addition to rubber stamping, are used to create multiples. Copy art (xerography, photocopy) is a common practice, with both mono and color copying being extensively used within the network. Ubiquitous &#x27;add &amp; pass&#x27; sheets that are designed to be circulated through the network with each artist adding and copying, chain-letter fashion, have also received some unfavorable criticism. However, Xerography has been a key technology in the creation of many short-run periodicals and zines about mail art, and for the printed documentation that has been the traditional project culmination sent to participants. Inkjet and laserprint computer printouts are also used, both to disseminate artwork and for reproducing zines and documentation, and PDF copies of paperless periodicals and unprinted documentation are circulated by email. Photography is widely used as an art form, to provide images for artistamps and rubber stamps, and within printed and digital magazines and documentation, while some projects have focused on the intersection of mail art with the medium itself.

===Lettering and language===
Lettering, whether handwritten or printed, is integral to mail art. The written word is used as a literary art form, as well as for personal letters and notes sent with artwork and recordings of the spoken word, both of poetry and prose, are also a part of the network. Although English has been the de facto language, because of the movement&#x27;s inception in America, an increasing number of mail artists, and mail artist groups on the Internet, now communicate in Breton, French, Italian, German, Spanish, and Russian.

===Other media===

In addition to appropriating the postage stamp model, mail artists have assimilated other design formats for printed artworks. Artists&#x27; books, decobooks and friendship books, banknotes, stickers, tickets, artist trading cards (ATCs), badges, food packaging, diagrams, and maps have all been used.

Mail artists routinely mix media; collage and photomontage are popular, affording some mail art the stylistic qualities of pop art or Dada. Mail artists often use collage techniques to produce original postcards, envelopes, and work that may be transformed using copy art techniques or computer software, then photocopied or printed out in limited editions.

Printed matter and ephemera are often circulated among mail artists, and after artistic treatment, these common items enter into the mail art network. Small assemblages, sculptural forms, or found objects of irregular shapes and sizes are parceled up or sent unwrapped to deliberately tease and test the efficiency of the postal service. Mailable fake fur (&quot;Hairmail&quot;) and Astroturf postcards were circulated in the late 1990s.

Having borrowed the notion of intermedia from Fluxus, mail artists are often active simultaneously in several different fields of expression. Music and sound art have long been celebrated aspects of mail art, at first using cassette tape, then on CD and as sound files sent via the Internet.

Performance art has also been a prominent facet, particularly since the advent of mail art meetings and congresses. Performances recorded on film or video are communicated via DVD and movie files over the internet. Video is also increasingly being employed to document mail art shows of all kinds.

==Quotations==

Correspondence art is an elusive art form, far more variegated by its very nature than, say, painting. Where a painting always involves paint and a support surface, correspondence art can appear as any one of dozens of media transmitted through the mail. While the vast majority of correspondence art or mail art activities take place in the mail, today&#x27;s new forms of electronic communication blur the edges of that forum. In the 1960s, when correspondence art first began to blossom, most artists found the postal service to be the most readily available – and least expensive – medium of exchange. Today&#x27;s micro-computers with modern facilities offer anyone computing and communicating power that two decades ago were available only to the largest institutions and corporations, and only a few decades previous weren&#x27;t available to anyone at any price. – Ken Friedman

Cultural exchange is a radical act. It can create paradigms for the reverential sharing and preservation of the earth&#x27;s water, soil, forests, plants and animals. The ethereal networker aesthetic calls for guiding that dream through action. Cooperation and participation, and the celebration of art as a birthing of life, vision, and spirit are first steps. The artists who meet each other in the Eternal Network have taken these steps. Their shared enterprise is a contribution to our common future. – Chuck Welch

The purpose of mail art, an activity shared by many artists throughout the world, is to establish an aesthetical communication between artists and common people in every corner of the globe, to divulge their work outside the structures of the art market and outside the traditional venues and institutions: a free communication in which words and signs, texts and colours act like instruments for a direct and immediate interaction. – Loredana Parmesani

<text>An art movement is a tendency or style in art with a specific art philosophy or goal, followed by a group of artists during a specific period of time, (usually a few months, years or decades) or, at least, with the heyday of the movement defined within a number of years. Art movements were especially important in modern art, when each consecutive movement was considered a new avant-garde movement. Western art had been, from the Renaissance up to the middle of the 19th century, underpinned by the logic of perspective and an attempt to reproduce an illusion of visible reality (figurative art). By the end of the 19th century many artists felt a need to create a new style which would encompass the fundamental changes taking place in technology, science and philosophy (abstract art).

== Concept ==
According to theories associated with modernism and also the concept of postmodernism, &quot;art movements&quot; are especially important during the period of time corresponding to modern art. The period of time called &quot;modern art&quot; is posited to have changed approximately halfway through the 20th century and art made afterward is generally called contemporary art. Postmodernism in visual art begins and functions as a parallel to late modernism and refers to that period after the &quot;modern&quot; period called contemporary art. The postmodern period began during late modernism (which is a contemporary continuation of modernism), and according to some theorists postmodernism ended in the 21st century. During the period of time corresponding to &quot;modern art&quot; each consecutive movement was often considered a new avant-garde.

Also during the period of time referred to as &quot;modern art&quot; each movement was seen corresponding to a somewhat grandiose rethinking of all that came before it, concerning the visual arts. Generally there was a commonality of visual style linking the works and artists included in an art movement. Verbal expression and explanation of movements has come from the artists themselves, sometimes in the form of an art manifesto, and sometimes from art critics and others who may explain their understanding of the meaning of the new art then being produced.

In the visual arts, many artists, theorists, art critics, art collectors, art dealers and others mindful of the unbroken continuation of modernism and the continuation of modern art even into the contemporary era, ascribe to and welcome new philosophies of art as they appear. Postmodernist theorists posit that the idea of art movements are no longer as applicable, or no longer as discernible, as the notion of art movements had been before the postmodern era. There are many theorists however who doubt as to whether or not such an era was actually a fact; or just a passing fad.

The term refers to tendencies in visual art, novel ideas and architecture, and sometimes literature. In music it is more common to speak about genres and styles instead. See also cultural movement, a term with a broader connotation.

As the names of many art movements use the -ism suffix (for example cubism and futurism), they are sometimes referred to as &quot;isms&quot;.

<text>Conversation is interactive communication between two or more people. The development of conversational skills and etiquette is an important part of socialization. The development of conversational skills in a new language is a frequent focus of language teaching and learning. Conversation analysis is a branch of sociology which studies the structure and organization of human interaction, with a more specific focus on conversational interaction.

==Definition and characterization==

No generally accepted definition of conversation exists, beyond the fact that a conversation involves at least two people talking together. Consequently, the term is often defined by what it is not. A ritualized exchange such as a mutual greeting is not a conversation, and an interaction that includes a marked status differential (such as a boss giving orders) is also not a conversation. An interaction with a tightly focused topic or purpose is also generally not considered a conversation. Summarizing these properties, one authority writes that &quot;Conversation is the kind of speech that happens informally, symmetrically, and for the purposes of establishing and maintaining social ties.&quot;

From a less technical perspective, a writer on etiquette in the early 20th century defined conversation as the polite give and take of subjects thought of by people talking with each other for company.

Conversations follow rules of etiquette because conversations are social interactions, and therefore depend on social convention. Specific rules for conversation arise from the cooperative principle. Failure to adhere to these rules causes the conversation to deteriorate or eventually to end. Contributions to a conversation are responses to what has previously been said.

Conversations may be the optimal form of communication, depending on the participants&#x27; intended ends. Conversations may be ideal when, for example, each party desires a relatively equal exchange of information, or when the parties desire to build social ties. On the other hand, if permanency or the ability to review such information is important, written communication may be ideal. Or if time-efficient communication is most important, a speech may be preferable.

Conversation involves a lot more nuanced and implied context, that lies beneath just the words.

Conversation is generally face-to-face person-to-person at the same time (synchronous) – possibly online with video applications such as Skype, but might also include audio-only phone calls. It would not generally include internet written communication which tends to be asynchronous (not same time – can read and respond later if at all) and does not fit the &#x27;con&#x27;=&#x27;with&#x27; in &#x27;conversation&#x27;. In face to face conversation it has been suggested that 85% of the communication is non-verbal/body language – a smile, a frown, a shrug, tone of voice conveying much added meaning to the mere words. Short forms of written communication such as sms are thus frequently misunderstood.

In English slang, a conversation that is generally found to be uninteresting is referred to as &#x27;boring&#x27; and the person at the center of that conversation a &#x27;bore&#x27; 

==Classification==

=== Banter ===

Banter is short witty sentences that bounce back and forth between individuals. Often banter uses clever put-downs and witty insults similar to flyting, misunderstandings (often intentional), zippy wisecracks, zingers, flirtation, and puns. The idea is that each line of banter should &quot;top&quot; the one before it and be, in short, a verbal war of wit.

Films that have used banter as a way of structure in conversations are:

* &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; (1938)
* &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; (1940)
* &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; (1946)
* &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; (1993)

Important factors in delivering a banter is the subtext, situation and the rapport with the person. Every line in a banter should be able to evoke both an emotional response and ownership without hurting one&#x27;s feelings. Following a structure that the involved parties understand is important, even if the subject and structure is absurd, a certain level of progression should be kept in a manner that it connects with the involved parties.

Different methods of story telling could be used in delivering banter, like making an unexpected turn in the flow of structure (interrupting a comfortable structure), taking the conversation towards an expected crude form with evoking questions, doubts, self-conscientiousness (creating intentional misunderstandings), or layering the existing pattern with multiple anchors. It is important to quit the bantering with the sensibility of playground rules, both parties should not obsess on topping each other, continuously after a certain point of interest. It is as Shakespeare said &quot;Brevity is the soul of wit.&quot;

=== Discussion ===

One element of conversation is discussion: sharing opinions on subjects that are thought of during the conversation. In polite society the subject changes before discussion becomes dispute or controversial. For example, if theology is being &quot;discussed&quot;, maybe no one is insisting a particular view be accepted.

===Subject===
Many conversations can be divided into four categories according to their major subject content:
* &quot;Subjective ideas&quot;, which often serve to extend understanding and awareness.
* &quot;Objective facts&quot;, which may serve to consolidate a widely held view.
* &quot;Other people&quot; (usually absent), which may be either critical, competitive, or supportive. This includes gossip.
* &quot;Oneself&quot;, which sometimes indicate attention-seeking behavior or can provide relevant information about oneself to participants in the conversation.

The proportional distribution of any given conversation between the categories can offer useful psychological insights into the mind set of the participants. Practically, however, few conversations fall exclusively into one category. This is the reason that the majority of conversations are difficult to categorize.

===Functions===
Most conversations may be classified by their goal. Conversational ends may shift over the life of the conversation.
* Functional conversation is designed to convey information in order to help achieve an individual or group goal.
* Small talk is a type of conversation where the topic is less important than the social purpose of achieving bonding between people or managing personal distance, such as &#x27;how is the weather&#x27; might be portrayed as an example, which conveys no practicality whatsoever.

==Aspects==

===Differences between men and women===

A study completed in July 2007 by Matthias Mehl of the University of Arizona shows that contrary to popular belief, there is little difference in the number of words used by men and women in conversation. The study showed that on average each gender uses about 16,000 words per day.

===Between strangers===
There are certain situations, typically encountered while traveling, which result in strangers sharing what would ordinarily be an intimate social space such as sitting together on a bus or airplane. In such situations strangers are likely to share intimate personal information they would not ordinarily share with strangers. A special case emerges when one of the travelers is a mental health professional and the other party shares details of their personal life in the apparent hope of receiving help or advice.

===Narcissism===

Conversational narcissism is a term used by the Marxist sociologist Charles Derber in his book &quot;The Pursuit of Attention: Power and Ego in Everyday Life&quot;.

Derber argued that the social support system in America is relatively weak, which leads people to compete for attention. In social situations, he believes that people tend to steer the conversation away from others and toward themselves. &quot;Conversational narcissism is the key manifestation of the dominant attention-getting psychology in America,&quot; he wrote. &quot;It occurs in informal conversations among friends, family and coworkers. The profusion of popular literature about listening and the etiquette of managing those who talk constantly about themselves suggests its pervasiveness in everyday life.&quot; Derber asserts that this &quot;conversational narcissism&quot; often occurs subtly rather than overtly because it is socially prudent to avoid being judged an egotist.

Derber distinguishes the &quot;shift-response&quot; from the &quot;support-response&quot;. A &quot;shift-response&quot; takes the focus of attention away from the last speaker and refocuses on the new speaker, as in: &quot;John: I&#x27;m feeling really starved. Mary: Oh, I just ate.&quot; Whereas, a &quot;support-response&quot; maintains the focus on the last speaker, as in: &quot;John: I&#x27;m feeling really starved. Mary: When was the last time you ate?&quot;

===Artificial intelligence===
The ability to generate conversation that cannot be distinguished from a human participant has been one test of a successful artificial intelligence (the Turing test). A human judge engages in a natural-language conversation with one human and one machine, during which the machine tries to appear human (and the human does not try to appear other than human). If the judge cannot tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the test. One limitation of this test is that the conversation is by text as opposed to speech, not allowing tone to be shown.

===One&#x27;s self===
Also called intrapersonal communication, the act of conversing with oneself can help solve problems or serve therapeutic purposes like avoiding silence.

==Literature==
Authors who have written extensively on conversation and attempted to analyze its nature include:
* Milton Wright wrote &quot;The Art of Conversation&quot;, a comprehensive treatment of the subject, in 1936. The book deals with conversation both for its own sake, and for political, sales, or religious ends. Milton portrays conversation as an art or creation that people can play with and give life to.
* Kerry Patterson, Joseph Grenny, Al Switzler, and Ron McMillan have written two &quot;New York Times&quot; bestselling books on conversation. The first one, &quot;Crucial Conversations: Tools for Talking When Stakes are High&quot;, McGraw-Hill, 2002, teaches skills for handling disagreement and high-stakes issues at work and at home. The second book, &quot;Crucial Accountability: Tools for Resolving Violated Expectations, Broken Commitments, and Bad Behavior&quot;, McGraw-Hill, 2013, teaches important skills for dealing with accountability issues.
*&quot;Difficult Conversations: How to Discuss What Matters Most&quot; (Viking Penguin, 1999), a book by Bruce Patton, Douglas Patterson and Sheila Heen was one of the work products from the Harvard Negotiation Project. This book built on, and extended the approach developed by Roger Fisher and William Ury in &quot;Getting To Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In&quot; (Houghton Mifflin, 1981). The book introduced useful concepts such as the Three Conversations (The &#x27;What Happened&#x27; Conversation, The Feelings Conversation, and The Identity Conversation), Creating a Learning Conversation, and Collaborative Problem Solving.
* Charles Blattberg has written two books defending an approach to politics that emphasizes conversation, in contrast to negotiation, as the preferred means of resolving conflict. His &quot;From Pluralist to Patriotic Politics: Putting Practice First&quot;, Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2000, , is a work of political philosophy; and his &quot;Shall We Dance? A Patriotic Politics for Canada&quot;, Montreal and Kingston: McGill-Queen&#x27;s University Press, 2003, , applies that philosophy to the Canadian case.
* Paul Drew &amp; John Heritage – &quot;Talk at Work&quot;, a study of how conversation changes in social and workplace situations.
* Neil Postman – &quot;Amusing Ourselves to Death&quot; (Conversation is not the book&#x27;s specific focus, but discourse in general gets good treatment here)
* Deborah Tannen

<doc id="228579" wikidata="Q2706048" url="?curid=228579" title="Thomas Brown (philosopher)">
<text>Thomas Brown (9 January 17782 April 1820) was a Scottish physician, philosopher, and poet. Renowned as a physician for his structured thinking, diagnostic skills, and prodigious memory, Brown went on to hold the Chair of Moral Philosophy at Edinburgh University from 1810 to 1820; where, &quot;rather than pronouncing how he found things to be, [Brown] taught [his students] &quot;how to go about thinking about things&quot;.&quot;

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Brown was born at Kirkmabreck, Kirkcudbrightshire, the son of Rev. Samuel Brown (died 1779) (minister of Kirkmabreck and Kirkdale) and Mary Smith.

Their son was a wide reader and an eager student. Educated at several schools in London, he went to the University of Edinburgh in 1792, where he attended Dugald Stewart&#x27;s moral philosophy class, but does not appear to have completed his course. After studying law for a time he took up medicine; his graduation thesis &quot;De Somno&quot; was well received. But his strength lay in metaphysical analysis.

=== Career ===
Brown set an answer to the objections raised against the appointment of Sir John Leslie to the mathematical professorship (1805). Leslie, a follower of David Hume, was attacked by the clerical party as a sceptic and an infidel, and Brown took the opportunity to defend Hume&#x27;s doctrine of causality as in no way inimical to religion. His defence, at first only a pamphlet, became in its third edition a lengthy treatise entitled &quot;Inquiry into the Relation of Cause and Effect&quot;, and is a fine specimen of Brown&#x27;s analytical faculty.

In 1806, Brown became a medical practitioner in partnership with James Gregory (1753–1821), but, though successful, preferred literature and philosophy. After twice failing to gain a professorship in the university, he was invited, during an illness of Dugald Stewart in the session of 1808–1809, to act as his substitute, and during the following session he undertook much of Stewart&#x27;s work. The students received him with enthusiasm, due partly to his splendid rhetoric and partly to the novelty and ingenuity of his views. In 1810 he was appointed as colleague to Stewart, a position which he held for the rest of his life. Brown was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1815. He wrote his lectures at high pressure, and devoted much time to the editing and publication of the numerous poems which he had written at various times during his life. He was also preparing an abstract of his lectures as a handbook for his class. His health, never strong, gave way under the strain of his work.

He was advised to take a trip to London, where he died in 1820 aged 42. His body was returned to Kirkmabreck for burial.

=== Criticism of Erasmus Darwin ===
One of Brown&#x27;s notable works included a critique of Erasmus Darwin&#x27;s theory of transmutation. The philosopher published it in the form of a detailed study &quot;Observations on the zoonomia of Erasmus Darwin&quot; (1798), which was recognized as a mature work of criticism.

There, Brown wrote:
Noteworthy, Brown&#x27;s criticism of the Darwinian thesis, like that of Rudolf Virchow, did not come from any religious feeling. In fact, Brown&#x27;s critique bears an uncanny resemblance to &quot;Thomas Robert Malthus&#x27;s Essay on the Principle of Population&quot; (1798) in which Malthus&#x27;s main objection against Darwin&#x27;s thesis, like that of Brown, was epistemological rather than religious.

=== Reception ===
Brown&#x27;s philosophy occupies an intermediate place between the earlier Scottish school and the later associational psychology, to which he really belonged. Later criticism of Brown&#x27;s philosophy lessened its popularity, a severe attack being made by Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet in his &quot;Discussions&quot; and &quot;Lectures on Metaphysics&quot;. A high estimate of his merits was shown in John Stuart Mill&#x27;s &quot;Examination of Hamilton&quot;. Also, in David Welsh&#x27;s &quot;Account of the Life and Writings&quot; (1825) and James McCosh&#x27;s &quot;Scottish Philosophy&quot;. Friedrich Eduard Beneke, who found in him anticipations of some of his own doctrines.

The philosopher Schopenhauer wrote of him in 1844:
Quite recently Thomas Brown has taught ... in his extremely tedious book &quot;Inquiry into the Relation of Cause and Effect&quot; (4th ed., 1835), ... that knowledge springs from an innate, intuitive, and instinctive conviction; he is therefore essentially on the right path. However, the crass ignorance is unpardonable by which, in this book of 476 pages, 130 of which are devoted to the refutation of Hume, no mention at all is made of Kant, who cleared up the matter seventy years ago.|&quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot;, Vol. II, Chapter IV

In his &quot;On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason&quot;, § 20, Schopenhauer claimed that Brown intended to provide support for the Cosmological Proof of God&#x27;s Existence. &quot;… sometimes there is an intention…a theological design flirting with the Cosmological Proof…. We find the clearest instance of this in Thomas Browne&#x27;s [sic] book, &quot;On the Relation of Cause and Effect&quot;…this Englishman rightly recognizes, that the causal law has invariably to do with &quot;changes&quot;, and that every effect is accordingly a &quot;change&quot;. Yet…he is unwilling to admit that every cause is likewise a &quot;change&quot; and that the whole process is therefore nothing but the uninterrupted connection of &quot;changes&quot; succeeding one another in time. On the contrary, he persists in clumsily calling the cause an &quot;object or substance, which precedes the change&quot;…in order that his definition may on no account stand in the way of the Cosmological Proof….&quot;

His friend and biographer, David Welsh (1793–1845), superintended the publication of Brown&#x27;s text-book, the &quot;Physiology of the Human Mind&quot;, and his &quot;Lectures on the Philosophy of the Human Mind&quot;, which was published by his successors, John Stewart and Edward Milroy. The &quot;Lectures&quot; were well received both in England (where it reached a 19th edition) and in the USA.

Among Brown&#x27;s poems, which were influenced by Alexander Pope and Akenside were: &quot;Paradise of Coquettes&quot; (1814); &quot;Wanderer in Norway&quot; (1815); &quot;Warfiend&quot; (1816); &quot;Bower of Spring&quot; (1817); &quot;Agnes&quot; (1818); &quot;Emily&quot; (1819); a collected edition in 4 vols. appeared in 1820. His poetry, though graceful, lacked force, and is now forgotten.

Brown was one of the first contributors to the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;. In its second number, he published a criticism of Immanuel Kant&#x27;s philosophy, based on Charles de Villers&#x27;s account of it.

<text>Raymond Edward &quot;Ray&quot; Johnson (October 16, 1927 – January 13, 1995) was an American artist. Known primarily as a collagist and correspondence artist, he was a seminal figure in the history of Neo-Dada and early Pop art and was described as &quot;New York&#x27;s most famous unknown artist&quot;. Johnson also staged and participated in early performance art events as the founder of a far-ranging mail art network – the New York Correspondence School – which picked up momentum in the 1960s and is still active today. He is occasionally associated with members of the Fluxus movement but was never a member. He lived in New York City from 1949 to 1968, when he moved to a small town in Long Island and remained there until his suicide.

==Early years and education==

Born in Detroit, Michigan, on October 16, 1927, Ray Johnson grew up in a working-class neighborhood and attended Cass Technical High School where he was enrolled in the advertising art program. He took weekly classes at the Detroit Art Institute and spent a summer drawing at Ox-Bow School in Saugatuck, Michigan, affiliated with the Art Institute of Chicago.

Johnson left Detroit after high school in the summer of 1945 to attend the progressive Black Mountain College (BMC) in North Carolina, where he stayed for the next three years (spending the spring 1946 semester at the Art Students League in New York but returning the following summer). Josef Albers, before and after his notable sabbatical in Mexico, was in residence at Black Mountain College for six of the ten semesters that Johnson studied there. Anni Albers, Walter Gropius, Lyonel Feininger, Robert Motherwell, Ossip Zadkine, Paul Rand, Alvin Lustig, Ilya Bolotowski, Jacob Lawrence, Beaumont Newhall, M. C. Richards, and Jean Varda also taught at BMC during Johnson&#x27;s time there. Johnson decided on Albers&#x27; advice to stay at BMC for a final term in summer 1948, when the visiting faculty included John Cage, Merce Cunningham, Willem de Kooning, Buckminster Fuller, and Richard Lippold. Johnson took part in &quot;The Ruse of Medusa&quot; – the culmination of Cunningham&#x27;s Satie Festival - with Cage, Cunningham, Fuller, Willem and Elaine de Kooning, Lippold, Ruth Asawa, Arthur Penn, and others among the cast and crew. &quot;Because of those who participated, the event has taken on the reputation of a watershed event in &#x27;mixed media wrote Martin Duberman in his history of BMC.

In the documentary &quot;How to Draw a Bunny&quot;, Richard Lippold delicately but candidly confesses to carrying on a love affair with Johnson for many years which began at Black Mountain College.

I risk to say, [that at Black Mountain College] &#x27;anything went&#x27;—between the students and the faculty ... As I said to my wife the other day, &#x27;I think I&#x27;m a good old man now, but I was a very bad boy.&#x27; ... She agreed. We had a little house, my family and me, and he would arrive every morning with a little bouquet of wild flowers, and singing. Eventually our relationship became very intimate, so I brought him back to New York ... and obviously, we didn&#x27;t live together, steadily, because I had my family. We were quite close together until 1974, so that&#x27;s a long period of time. From &#x27;48 to &#x27;74, twenty some years. Because it was a very intimate relationship, a loving relationship. And it would be very hard for me to separate him as a person from his work. I don&#x27;t think I could do that.

==New York years==

Johnson moved with Richard Lippold to New York City by early 1949, rejoining Cage and Cunningham and befriending, within the next couple of years, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Cy Twombly, Ad Reinhardt, Stan Vanderbeek, Norman Solomon, Lucy Lippard, Sonia Sekula, Carolyn Brown and Earle Brown, Judith Malina, Diane di Prima, Julian Beck, Remy Charlip, James Waring, and innumerable others. With the American Abstract Artists group, Johnson painted geometric abstractions that, in part, reflected the influence of Albers. But by 1953 he turned to collage and left the American Abstract Artists, rejecting his early paintings, which it is rumored that he later burned in Cy Twombly&#x27;s fireplace. Johnson began to create small, irregularly shaped works incorporating fragments from popular culture, most notably the Lucky Strikes logo and images from fan magazines of such movie stars as Elvis Presley, James Dean, Marilyn Monroe, and Shirley Temple. In the summer of 1955, he coined a term for these small collages: &quot;moticos&quot;. He carried boxes of moticos around New York, showing them on sidewalks, at cafes, in Grand Central Station and other public places; he asked passersby what they thought of them, and recorded some of their responses. He began mailing collages to friends and strangers, along with a series of manifestos, mimeographed for distribution, including &quot;What is a Moticos?&quot;, excerpts of which were published in an article by John Wilcock in the inaugural issue of &quot;The Village Voice&quot;.

A friend of Johnson&#x27;s, art critic Suzi Gablik, brought photographer Elisabeth Novick to document an installation of dozens of Johnson&#x27;s moticos in autumn of 1955. (Most of these were destroyed or recycled by the artist.) &quot;The random arrangement, on a dilapidated cellar door in Lower Manhattan may even have been the first informal Happening,&quot; she recalled later. According to Henry Geldzahler, &quot;[Ray&#x27;s] collages &quot;Elvis Presley No. 1&quot; and &quot;James Dean&quot; stand as the Plymouth Rock of the Pop movement.&quot; Johnson&#x27;s friend Lucy Lippard would later write that &quot;The Elvis ... and Marilyn Monroe [collages], heralded Warholian Pop.&quot; Johnson was quickly recognized as part of the nascent Pop generation. A note about the cover image in January 1958&#x27;s &quot;Art News&quot; pointed out that &quot;[Jasper] Johns&#x27; first one-man show ... places him with such better-known colleagues as Rauschenberg, Twombly, Kaprow and Ray Johnson&quot;.

Johnson worked part-time at the Orientalia Bookstore in the Lower East Side as he began to deepen his understanding of Zen philosophy and to employ &quot;chance&quot; in his work. Both of these interests increasingly informed his collages, performances, and mail art. Johnson also found occasional work as a graphic designer. He had met Andy Warhol by 1956; both designed several book covers for New Directions and other publishers. Johnson had a series of whimsical flyers advertising his design services printed via offset lithography, and began mailing these out. These were joined in 1956–7 by two small promotional artists&#x27; books, and , self-published in editions of 500.

Johnson participated in about a dozen performance art events between 1957 and 1963 – in his own short pieces (&quot;Funeral Music for Elvis Presley&quot; and &quot;Lecture on Modern Music&quot;), in those of others (by James Waring and Susan Kaufman), and via his own compositions performed by his colleagues at The Living Theatre and during the Fluxus Yam Festival of 1963. From 1961 on, Johnson periodically staged events he called &quot;Nothings&quot;, described to his friend William Wilson as &quot;an attitude as opposed to a happening&quot;, which would parallel the &quot;Happenings&quot; of Allan Kaprow and later Fluxus events. The first of these, &quot;Nothing by Ray Johnson&quot;, was part of a weekly series of events in July 1961 at the AG Gallery, a venue in New York operated by George Maciunas and Almus Salcius; Yoko Ono&#x27;s first solo show was on view in the gallery at the time. Ed Plunkett later recalled entering an empty room. &quot;Visitors began to enter the premises. Most of them looked quite dismayed that nothing was going on ... Well, finally Ray arrived ... and he brought with him a large corrugated cardboard box of wooden spools. Soon after arriving Ray emptied this box of spools down the staircase ... with these ... one had to step cautiously to avoid slipping ... I was delighted with this gesture.&quot; Johnson&#x27;s Second Nothing took place at Maidman Playhouse, New York, in 1962. It was part of a variety show that was organized by Nicholas Cernovich and Alan Marlow of New York Poet&#x27;s Theatre, had lighting design by Billy Name (aka Billy Linich), and featured artists such as Fred Herko, George Brecht, Simone Morris, La Monte Young, Stan Vanderbeek, and others. In 1964/65, Ray Johnson circulated publicity for an imaginary gallery called the Robin Gallery, which was a pun on the Rueben Gallery where some of the earliest happenings took place and was said by one critic to “put the happenings out on the street in a series of irresponsible exploits and escapades.&quot;

Johnson&#x27;s first known piece of mail directing a recipient to &quot;please send to...&quot; someone else dates from 1958; the phrases &quot;please add to and return&quot;, &quot;please add and send to&quot;, and even &quot;please do not send to&quot; followed. Johnson&#x27;s mail art activities became more systematic with the help of several friends, particularly Bill Wilson and his mother, assemblage artist May Wilson, along with Marie Tavroges Stilkind and later Toby Spiselman. In 1962, Ed Plunkett named Johnson&#x27;s endeavors &#x27;the New York Correspondence School&#x27; (NYCS). In early 1962, Joseph Byrd responded to several mailings with a red rubber stamp, &quot;THIS IS NOT ART,&quot; which Johnson then used in his mailings for several months. On April 1, 1968, the first of the meeting of the NYCS was held at the Society of Friends Meeting House on Rutherford Place in New York City. Two more meetings were called by Johnson in the following weeks, including the Seating-Meeting at New York&#x27;s Finch College, about which John Gruen reported: &quot;It was ... attended by many artists and &#x27;members&#x27; ... all of whom sat around wondering when the meeting would start. It never did ... people wrote things on bits of paper, on a blackboard, or simply talked. It was all strangely meaningless – and strangely meaningful.&quot; Johnson staged such events regularly, often following them up with witty typed reports, photocopied for wide distribution via the post. Such gatherings continued to be held in various guises into the mid-1980s.

Johnson produced 13 known unbound pages of his enigmatic &quot;A Book About Death&quot; from 1963 to 1965. Consisting of cryptic texts and drawings (mostly) by Johnson, they were mailed a few at a time, randomly, and offered for sale via a classified ad in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;., thus very few people ever received all the pages. Something Else Press published Johnson&#x27;s &quot;The Paper Snake&quot; for a wider audience in 1965. Remarking about himself and the book, Johnson said:
I&#x27;m an artist and a, well, I shouldn&#x27;t call myself a poet but other people have. What I do is classify the words as poetry. ... &quot;The Paper Snake&quot; ... is all my writings, rubbings, plays, things that I had given to the publisher, Dick Higgins, editor and publisher, which I mailed to him or brought to him in cardboard boxes or shoved under his door, or left in his sink, or whatever, over a period of years. He saved all these things, designed and published a book, and I simply as an artist did what I did without classification. So when the book appeared the book stated, &quot;Ray Johnson is a poet&quot;, but I never said, &quot;this is a poem&quot;, I simply wrote what I wrote and it later became classified.

Long out of print, &quot;The Paper Snake&quot; was re-printed by Siglio Press in 2014.

On June 3, 1968 – the same day that Andy Warhol was shot by Valerie Solanas with a gun she&#x27;d stored under May Wilson&#x27;s bed – Johnson was mugged at knifepoint. Two days later, Robert Kennedy was assassinated. Severely shaken, Johnson moved to Glen Cove, Long Island, and the next year bought a house in nearby Locust Valley, where Richard Lippold and his family resided. He began to live in a state of increasing reclusion in what he called a &quot;small white farmhouse with a Joseph Cornell attic.&quot;

Johnson appeared twice in the &quot;Art in Process&quot; series, described by blogger Greg Allen as &quot;a series of topical, process-oriented, teaching exhibitions organized by Finch College Museum director Elayne Varian. They included sketches, models and studies to show how the artist did what he was doing.&quot;

==Locust Valley years==
From 1966 into the mid-1970s, Johnson&#x27;s work was shown at the Willard Gallery (New York) and Feigen Gallery (Chicago and New York), as well as by Angela Flowers in London and Arturo Schwarz in Milan. In 1970, mail from 107 participants to curator Marcia Tucker was exhibited in a Ray Johnson – New York Correspondence School exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York – a significant moment of cultural validation for Johnson. Another notable exhibition followed – Correspondence: An Exhibition of the Letters of Ray Johnson at the North Carolina Museum of Art in Raleigh, 1976, organized by Richard Craven: 81 lenders&#x27; works, 35 years of Johnson&#x27;s outgoing mail. Around that time, Johnson began his silhouette project, creating approximately 200 profiles of personal friends, artists, and celebrities which became the basis for many of his later collages. His subjects included Chuck Close, Andy Warhol, William S. Burroughs, Edward Albee, Louise Nevelson, Larry Rivers, Lynda Benglis, Nam Jume Paik, David Hockney, David Bowie, Christo, Peter Hujar, Roy Lichtenstein, Paloma Picasso, James Rosenquist, Richard Feigen, among others – a who&#x27;s who of the New York arts and letters scene.

During the 1980s Johnson purposefully receded from view, cultivating his role as outsider, maintaining personal connections via mail art and telephone largely in place of physical interaction. In 1981, he began a longstanding correspondence with librarian and artists&#x27; book specialist, Clive Phillpot. Only a handful of people were ever allowed into his house in Locust Valley. Eventually, Johnson ceased to exhibit or sell his work commercially altogether. His underground reputation bubbled beneath the surface into the 1980s and 90s despite his general absence from the flourishing New York art scene. Johnson feverishly continued to work on richer and more complex collages, such as &quot;Untitled (Seven Black Feet with Eyelashes)&quot;, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art. It demonstrates the artist&#x27;s incorporation of text into collage, which is his preferred medium. In contrast to his physical seclusion, Johnson&#x27;s pre-digital network of correspondents increased in size exponentially.

==Death==

On January 13, 1995, Johnson was seen diving off a bridge in Sag Harbor, Long Island, and backstroking out to sea. His body washed up on the beach the following day. Many aspects of his death involved the number &quot;13&quot;: the date; his age, 67 (6+7=13); the room number of a motel he had checked into earlier that day, 247 (2+4+7=13), etc. Some continue to speculate about a &#x27;last performance&#x27; aspect of Johnson&#x27;s drowning. Hundreds of collages were found carefully arranged in his home. He left no will and his estate is now administered by fine art dealership Adler Beatty.

==Film, television and music==
Over seven hours of videos with Ray were created by Nicholas Maravell in the late 1980s. Ray greatly enjoyed the creative process of making them and liked viewing them. Ray had wanted the videos to be played at his final scheduled gallery exhibition but at the last minute he had reason to cancel that show and he asked that the videos not be shown. These wishes were honored after Ray&#x27;s death even when the gallery owner tried repeatedly to have Maravell show them. Portions of the videos have been used by several filmmakers. A Sampler of them played at Ray&#x27;s Whitney Museum retrospective after Ray&#x27;s death. Robert Rodger created a website to honor and help share these videos.

Following his suicide, filmmakers Andrew Moore and John Walter (in conjunction with Frances Beatty of Richard L. Feigen &amp; Co.) spent six years probing the mysteries of Johnson&#x27;s life and art. Their collaboration yielded the award-winning documentary &quot;How to Draw a Bunny&quot;, released in 2002. The film includes interviews with artists Chuck Close, James Rosenquist, Billy Name, Christo and Jeanne-Claude, Judith Malina, and many others.

The Manic Street Preachers wrote and recorded a song about Johnson, titled &quot;Locust Valley.&quot; Released as a B-side on the &quot;Found That Soul&quot; single (2001), &quot;Locust Valley&quot; describes Johnson as &quot;famously unknown/elusive and dismantled&quot;.

John Cale&#x27;s song &quot;Hey Ray&quot; from the &quot;Extra Playful&quot; EP (2011) is about Cale&#x27;s encounters with Johnson in New York during the 1960s.

Canadian art rock band Women&#x27;s 2010 album &quot;Public Strain&quot; includes two songs that directly reference Ray Johnson. Locust Valley is the town where Johnson lived in New York State. Venice Lockjaw is a phrase Johnson incorporated in pins that he made to be given away at the Ubi Fluxus ibi Motus exhibit in 1990 at the Venice Biennale. Their 2008 album &quot;Women&quot; also featured a song called Sag Harbor Bridge, referencing the place of Johnson&#x27;s death.

==Exhibition history==

A temporary exhibition of Ray Johnson&#x27;s work opened in 2021 at The Art Institute of Chicago, entitled &quot;Ray Johnson c/o.&quot; The exhibition showed the relationship of Ray Johnson&#x27;s work to mail art, and the spirit of collaboration and connection that influenced the dispersal of much of his work. Utilizing collection donated to The Art Institute of Chicago by Bill Wilson, a lifelong acquaintance of Johnsons, as well as other who harbored Ray Johnsons circulated art, the exhibition showcased the largest collection on public display since the artists death. Items on display included the artists popular series of small cardboard collages called &#x27;moticos,&#x27; as well as some of the artists earlier work during his time at Black Mountain College.
