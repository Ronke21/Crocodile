<doc id="228921" wikidata="Q3336957" url="?curid=228921" title="National Woman Suffrage Association">
<text>The National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) was formed on May 15, 1869, to work for women&#x27;s suffrage in the United States. Its main leaders were Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. It was created after the women&#x27;s rights movement split over the proposed Fifteenth Amendment to the U. S. Constitution, which would in effect extend voting rights to black men. One wing of the movement supported the amendment while the other, the wing that formed the NWSA, opposed it, insisting that voting rights be extended to all women and all African Americans at the same time.

The NWSA worked primarily at the federal level in its campaign for women&#x27;s right to vote. In the early 1870s, it encouraged women to attempt to vote and to file lawsuits if prevented, arguing that the constitution implicitly enfranchised women through its guarantees of equal protection for all citizens. Many women attempted to vote, notably Susan B. Anthony, who was arrested and found guilty in a widely publicized trial. After the Supreme Court ruled that the constitution did not implicitly enfranchise women, the NWSA worked for an amendment that would do so explicitly.

The NWSA and its leaders also worked on related projects, such as a history of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement and the establishment of the International Council of Women, which is still active. The split in the suffrage movement was healed in 1890, when the NWSA merged with its rival, the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA) to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association under the leadership of Anthony and Stanton.

==Background ==

Women&#x27;s suffrage in the U.S. emerged as a significant issue in the mid-1800s. A key event was the first women&#x27;s rights convention, the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848, which was initiated by Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Women&#x27;s right to vote was endorsed at the convention only after a vigorous debate about an idea that was controversial even within the women&#x27;s movement. Soon after the convention, however, it became a central tenet of the movement.

In 1851, Stanton and Susan B. Anthony formed a decades-long partnership that became important to the women&#x27;s rights movement and to the future National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA). For the next several years, they worked together for the abolition of slavery and for women&#x27;s rights.

In 1866, Anthony and Stanton organized the Eleventh National Women&#x27;s Rights Convention, the first since the Civil War began.
The convention voted to transform itself into the American Equal Rights Association (AERA), whose purpose was to campaign for the equal rights of all citizens, especially the right of suffrage. Its members consisted mainly of activists in the women&#x27;s rights and abolitionist movements, and its leadership included such prominent activists as Lucretia Mott, Lucy Stone and Frederick Douglass.

Over time, the AERA members whose primary interest was women&#x27;s suffrage began to divide into two wings. One wing, whose leading figure was Lucy Stone, was willing for black men to achieve suffrage first, as the abolitionist movement insisted, and wanted to maintain close ties with the Republican Party. The other, whose leading figures were Stanton and Anthony, wanted women and black men be enfranchised at the same time and worked toward a politically independent women&#x27;s movement that would no longer be dependent on abolitionists for financial and other resources. In 1868, Anthony and Stanton began publishing &quot;The Revolution&quot;, a weekly women&#x27;s rights newspaper in New York City that became an important tool for supporting their wing of the movement.

The dispute became increasingly bitter after the Fifteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was introduced, which would in effect enfranchise black men by prohibiting the denial of suffrage because of race. Lucy Stone supported the amendment even though she argued that suffrage for women would be more beneficial to the country than suffrage for black men. Stanton and Anthony opposed it, insisting that all women and all African Americans should be enfranchised at the same time. Stanton argued that by enfranchising almost all men while excluding all women, the amendment would give constitutional authority to the belief that men were superior to women, creating an &quot;aristocracy of sex&quot;. 

During the debate, Stanton wrote articles for &quot;The Revolution&quot; with language that was sometimes elitist and racially condescending. According to Cheris Kramarae and Lana Raknow, Stanton distinguished between &quot; &#x27;colorophobia&#x27; &quot; and her own belief in the &quot;evolutionary development of the human &#x27;race.&#x27; Stanton, for example, sometimes referred to the &#x27;lower orders of mankind&#x27;, an indication of her belief that education and &#x27;civilization&#x27; were needed to bring groups of people (particularly American Blacks and white working-class immigrants) out of barbarism and to the pinnacle of development...to admit Black men to enfranchisement was to admit them into &#x27;manhood&#x27;, making ever more difficult the task of redefining citizenship...for women.&quot; She also presumed that all &quot;lower orders&quot; promoted &quot;low ideas of womanhood.&quot; Stanton wrote, &quot;American women of wealth, education, virtue and refinement, if you do not wish the lower orders of Chinese, Africans, Germans and Irish, with their low ideas of womanhood to make laws for you and your daughters, to be your rulers, judges, and jurors---to dictate not only the civil, but moral codes by which you shall be governed, awake to the dangers of your present position, and demand, too, that women too shall be represented in government!&quot; 

These beliefs and contentions corresponded with her published comments from inaugural issues of &quot;The Revolution&quot;. In 1868, for instance, she argued that &quot;there is only one safe, sure way to build a government, and that is on the equality of all its citizens, male and female, black and white...Just so if woman finds it hard to bear the oppressive laws of a few Saxon Fathers, of the best orders of manhood, what may she not be called to endure when all the lower orders, natives and foreigners, Dutch, Irish, Chinese and African, legislate for her and her daughters?&quot; Ellen DuBois referred to this particularly litany of &quot;lower orders&quot; as &quot;betraying her underlying elitism&quot;, whereas Sue Davis renounced her question as one in a series that &quot;included racist and nativist comments.&quot; Stanton added that U.S. Senators &quot;degrade&quot; women &quot;in their political status, below unwashed and unlettered ditch-diggers, boot-blacks, hostlers, butchers, and barbers.&quot; Stanton then objected to laws being made for women by &quot;Patrick and Sambo and Hans and Yung Tung who do not know the difference between a Monarchy and a Republic, and who never read the &quot;Declaration of Independence&quot; or Webster&#x27;s spelling book.&quot;

==Formation of the National Woman Suffrage Association==

The AERA essentially collapsed after an acrimonious convention in 1869, and two rival women&#x27;s suffrage organizations were created in its wake. The National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) was created on May 15, 1869, two days after what turned out to be the AERA&#x27;s last convention, with Anthony and Stanton as its primary leaders. The American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA) was formed in November 1869, with Lucy Stone as its primary leader. The AWSA was initially larger and better funded, but Stanton and Anthony were more widely known as leaders of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement and were more influential in setting its direction.

Membership of the NWSA came partly from activists in organizations that Anthony and Stanton had created. One of those was the Women&#x27;s Loyal National League, whose 5000 members had by 1864 completed a petition drive, the largest in the nation&#x27;s history, in support of an amendment to abolish slavery. Another was the Working Women&#x27;s Association, which began as an organization of wage-earning women but evolved into one consisting almost entirely of journalists, doctors and other middle-class working women. Its members formed the core of the New York City segment of the NWSA, where the NWSA was headquartered.

==Comparison to AWSA==

Even after the Fifteenth Amendment was ratified in 1870, some important differences remained between the two organizations, and others emerged over time.

The NWSA worked mostly at the federal level, focusing on a constitutional amendment to achieve women&#x27;s suffrage, while the AWSA worked toward the same goal mostly at the state level. The NWSA&#x27;s meetings were open to everyone, but the AWSA allowed only delegates from recognized state organizations to vote at its meetings, although any member could attend and speak. The NWSA initially dealt with several women&#x27;s issues, such as divorce reform and equal pay for women, while the AWSA focused almost exclusively on suffrage. The AWSA&#x27;s membership included both women and men, and its first president was a man, Henry Ward Beecher. Stanton had originally proposed that the NWSA&#x27;s membership be limited to women, but her proposal was not accepted. In practice, however, the overwhelming majority of the NWSA members and officers were women. The NWSA held its conventions in Washington in accordance with its strategy of working primarily at the federal level, while the AWSA, working mainly at the state level, met in various cities across the country.

The author of a study of African American women in the suffrage movement lists nine who participated in the AWSA during the 1870s and six who participated in the NWSA. Stanton, a NWSA leader, &quot;moved to sever the women&#x27;s rights movement from its earlier moorings in the antislavery tradition.&quot; She periodically &quot;appealed to racial and ethnic prejudices, arguing that native-born white women deserved the vote more than non-whites and immigrants.&quot; Lee Boomer and New-York Historical Society educators noted that &quot;while the NWSA did not prohibit Black women from joining at the national level, local [NWSA] organizations could reject their participation.&quot;

==Early years==

Many suffragists were appalled by the split and insisted on reunification. Theodore Tilton, a newspaper editor and women&#x27;s rights advocate, initiated a petition drive calling for an end to the split. In April 1870, he convened a meeting of members of both organizations in an attempt to merge the two groups. Anthony opposed the idea of merger, as did her rival Lucy Stone. The NWSA sent three official representatives to the meeting who reported that their organization would agree to a merger only if the new organization agreed to work toward a Sixteenth Amendment to enfranchise women. Lucy Stone and two other AWSA members who were present as unofficial representatives of their organization left the meeting at that point. Those remaining, including some non-affiliated activists, formed a new organization, the Union Woman Suffrage Association (UWSA) with Tilton as president and a Sixteenth Amendment as its central goal. Soon afterward, the executive committee of the moribund AERA met and voted, over Stone&#x27;s objection, to merge into the UWSA. The next month, the NWSA itself merged into the UWSA, which essentially became the NWSA under a new name.

In May 1870, Anthony was forced to sell &quot;The Revolution&quot; because of mounting debts, thereby losing the NWSA&#x27;s primary media voice. The NWSA afterwards depended on smaller periodicals, such as &quot;The National Citizen and Ballot Box&quot;, edited by Matilda Joslyn Gage, and &quot;The Woman&#x27;s Tribune&quot;, edited by Clara Bewick Colby, to represent its viewpoint.

The NWSA benefited from the extensive lecture tours that Stanton and Anthony undertook, which brought new recruits into the organization and strengthened it at the local, state and national levels. Their journeys during that period covered a distance that was unmatched by any other reformer or politician. From 1869 to 1879, Stanton traveled eight months of the year on the lecture circuit, usually delivering one lecture per day, two on Sundays. In one year alone, Anthony traveled 13,000 miles and gave at least 170 lectures.

The NWSA did not have a national office, its mailing address being simply that of one of the officers. Anthony and Stanton did not receive a salary from the organization, supporting themselves with the money they earned by lecturing. In Anthony&#x27;s case, the money flowed the other way, with her lecture fees helping to fund the organization after she had paid &quot;The Revolution&#x27;s&quot; debts.

The fact that Anthony was unmarried gave her a legal advantage in building the organization. A married woman at that time had the legal status of &quot;feme covert&quot;, which, among other things, excluded her from signing contracts (she had to convince her husband to sign for her). As Anthony had no husband, she had the legal status of a &quot;feme sole&quot;, enabling her to sign contracts for convention halls and printed materials.

==New Departure==

In 1869, Virginia Minor, a member of the NWSA, and her husband Francis developed the idea that achieving women&#x27;s suffrage did not require a Sixteenth Amendment. Their approach, which became known as the New Departure, was based on the belief that women were already implicitly enfranchised by the U.S. Constitution. Their strategy relied heavily on the Fourteenth Amendment, which says, &quot;No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States … nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.&quot;

In January 1871, the UWSA delayed the opening session of its annual convention in Washington so its members could hear the historic address to the House Judiciary Committee by Victoria Woodhull, the first woman to speak before a Congressional body. A stockbroker with wealthy backers but little previous connection to the women&#x27;s movement, she presented a modified version of the New Departure strategy. Instead of asking the courts to rule that the Constitution implicitly enfranchised women, she asked Congress to pass a declaratory act to accomplish the same goal. The committee did not accept her proposal.
Woodhull was invited to give the same speech to the UWSA&#x27;s afternoon session and was greeted there with enthusiasm.

Woodhull&#x27;s reputation as a women&#x27;s suffrage leader continued to rise afterwards. Both Stanton and Anthony eagerly supported her at first, although Anthony became increasingly wary of her. At the UWSA&#x27;s 1872 convention, Woodhull attempted to commandeer the organization, urging its delegates to meet the next day in a different hall to form a new political party with herself as its candidate for president of the United States. In the chaotic situation that followed, Anthony shouted that the UWSA would meet the next day as usual and abruptly adjourned the session. The UWSA did meet the next day as planned, although with fewer participants because most of them had gone to the Woodhull event instead. The UWSA voted to transform itself at this meeting into a reconstituted NWSA with Anthony as president.

Later that year, Woodhull published details of an affair between Elizabeth Tilton, wife of Theodore Tilton, a prominent NWSA ally, and Reverend Henry Ward Beecher, the first president of the AWSA, seriously damaging the reputation of the entire women&#x27;s movement. Woodhull did not play a significant role in the women&#x27;s suffrage movement afterwards.

In 1871 the NWSA officially adopted the New Departure strategy, encouraging women to attempt to vote and to file lawsuits if denied that right. Soon hundreds of women tried to vote in dozens of localities.

==Challenging the denial of voting rights ==

In 1872, Susan B. Anthony convinced some election officials to allow her to vote in that year&#x27;s presidential elections, for which she was arrested and found guilty in a widely publicized trial. The judge at the trial was Justice Ward Hunt, who had recently been appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court and who conducted the trial as part of the federal circuit court system at that time.

The trial, &quot;United States v. Susan B. Anthony&quot;, was closely followed by the national press. Following a rule of common law at that time which prevented criminal defendants in federal courts from testifying, Hunt refused to allow Anthony to speak until the verdict had been delivered. At the end of the trial, Justice Hunt delivered his opinion, which he had put in writing, and directed the jury to deliver a guilty verdict.
When he asked Anthony if she had anything to say, she responded with &quot;the most famous speech in the history of the agitation for woman suffrage&quot;, according to Ann D. Gordon, a historian of the women&#x27;s movement.
Repeatedly ignoring the judge&#x27;s order to stop talking and sit down, she castigated him for denying her a trial by jury, but said that even if he had allowed the jury to discuss the case, she still would have been denied a trial by a jury of her peers because women were not allowed to be jurors.

The Supreme Court ruled in 1875 in &quot;Minor v. Happersett&quot; that &quot;the Constitution of the United States does not confer the right of suffrage upon anyone&quot;. 
The NWSA was obliged to return to the far more difficult strategy of achieving suffrage by constitutional amendment. In 1878, Senator Aaron A. Sargent, who was married to NWSA treasurer Ellen Clark Sargent, introduced into Congress the women&#x27;s suffrage amendment that more than forty years later would become the Nineteenth Amendment to the U. S. Constitution. Its text is identical to that of the Fifteenth Amendment except that it prohibits the denial of suffrage because of sex rather than race.

==Centennial of the Declaration of Independence==
On July 4, 1876, The United States celebrated its 100th anniversary with a ceremony in Philadelphia at Independence Hall, where the Declaration of Independence was approved on July 4, 1776. In preparation for the event, the NWSA established headquarters nearby and began drawing up &quot;articles of impeachment&quot; against the country&#x27;s male &quot;Political Sovereigns&quot;. NWSA officers asked permission to present a Declaration of Rights for Women at the official celebration, but they were refused. Despite the lack of permission, five women, headed by Anthony, walked onto the platform during the ceremony and handed their Declaration to Senator Thomas Ferry who was the acting Vice President of the United States, and the official in charge of the celebration. As they left, they handed out copies to the crowd. Stepping onto an unoccupied bandstand outside the hall, Anthony read the Declaration to a large crowd and invited everyone to a NWSA convention at the nearby Unitarian church to hear Stanton, Lucretia Mott and other speakers.

The Declaration was signed by Susan B. Anthony and these other leading members of the NWSA: Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Paulina Wright Davis, Ernestine L. Rose, Clarina I. H. Nichols, Mary Ann McClintock, Amy Post, Sarah Pugh, Matilda Joslyn Gage, Clemence Sophia Harned Lozier, Olympia Brown, Mathilde Franziska Anneke, Mathilde F. Wendt, Adelaide Thomson, Laura de Force Gordon, Ellen Clark Sargent, Virginia L. Minor, Sara Andrews Spencer, Lillie Devereux Blake, Phoebe Couzins, Jane Graham Jones, Abigail Scott Duniway, Belva A. Lockwood.

Lucretia Mott, former president of the AERA, was listed first among those who signed the Declaration and was a vice president of the NWSA. According to Sally Gregory McMillen, a historian of the women&#x27;s movement during this period, Lucretia Mott &quot;avoided taking sides&quot; in the split in the women&#x27;s movement, providing support to both sides.

==&quot;History of Woman Suffrage&quot;==

In 1876, Anthony and Stanton began working on the &quot;History of Woman Suffrage&quot;. Originally envisioned as a modest publication that could be produced quickly, the history evolved into a six-volume work of more than 5700 pages written over a period of 41 years, preserving a rich history that otherwise might have been lost. The first three volumes, which cover the movement up to 1885, were produced primarily by Anthony and Stanton. Anthony handled the production details while Stanton wrote most of the text. Matilda Joslyn Gage, another leading member of the NWSA, wrote three chapters of the first volume but was forced to abandon the project afterwards because of the illness of her husband. After Stanton&#x27;s death, Anthony published Volume 4 with the help of Ida Husted Harper. After Anthony&#x27;s death, Harper completed the last two volumes, bringing history up to 1920.

Stanton and Anthony had encouraged their rival Lucy Stone to assist with the work, or at least to send material that could be used by someone else to write the history of her wing of the movement, but she refused to cooperate in any way. Stanton&#x27;s daughter Harriot Stanton Blatch, wrote the 120-page chapter on Stone and the AWSA, which appears in Volume 2.
Even so, the &quot;History of Woman Suffrage&quot; places Stanton, Anthony and the NWSA at the center of the movement&#x27;s history and marginalizes the role of Stone and the AWSA.

==International Council of Women==

Anthony traveled to Europe in 1883, linking up with Stanton, who had arrived a few months earlier to visit her daughter, whose husband was British. Over a period of nine months, they met with leaders of various European women&#x27;s movements and began laying the foundation for an international women&#x27;s organization.

The NWSA agreed to host the founding congress of the organization that Stanton and Anthony were working toward. The first congress of the International Council of Women (ICW) met in Washington in 1888 with delegates from fifty-three women&#x27;s organizations in nine countries. The delegates represented various organizations, including suffrage associations, professional groups, literary clubs, temperance unions, labor leagues and missionary societies. The AWSA participated in the congress. The ICW convention brought increased publicity and respectability to the women&#x27;s movement, especially when President Grover Cleveland honored the delegates by inviting them to a reception at the White House.
Still active, ICW is associated with the United Nations.

==Reunification of the movement ==

Lucy Stone initiated the reunification of the rival suffrage organizations. She was seventy years old and in declining health, and the AWSA was losing strength. Anthony, by contrast, was by that point, &quot;among the senior political figures in the United States&quot;, according to a prominent historian of women&#x27;s history. Stanton, a popular speaker and a prolific writer of articles for newspapers and magazines, was also well known.

The AWSA&#x27;s annual meeting in November 1877 passed a resolution authorizing Stone to confer with Anthony about the possibility of a merger. The proposal did not generate significant controversy within the AWSA. There was strong opposition within the NWSA, however. Ida Husted Harper, Anthony&#x27;s co-worker and biographer, said the NWSA meetings that dealt with this issue &quot;were the most stormy in the history of the association.&quot; Matilda Joslyn Gage, an opponent of the merger, formed a competing organization called the Woman&#x27;s National Liberal Union, but it did not attract a significant following, and plans for merger proceeded.

The NWSA and the AWSA met in a joint convention in Washington and formed the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) on February 18, 1890. At Anthony&#x27;s insistence, Stanton agreed to accept its presidency. This was largely a symbolic move; the day after she was elected president, Stanton sailed to her daughter&#x27;s home in England, where she stayed for eighteen months, leaving Anthony effectively in charge. Stone was elected chair of the executive committee.

The NAWSA developed into the nation&#x27;s largest voluntary organization, with two million members. After women&#x27;s suffrage was achieved in 1920 by the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the NAWSA transformed itself into the League of Women Voters, which is still active.

<doc id="228927" wikidata="Q160770" url="?curid=228927" title="Prince George, Duke of Kent">
<text>Prince George, Duke of Kent (George Edward Alexander Edmund; 20 December 1902 – 25 August 1942) was a member of the British royal family, the fourth son of King George V and Queen Mary. He was a younger brother of kings Edward VIII and George VI. Prince George served in the Royal Navy in the 1920s and then briefly as a civil servant. He became Duke of Kent in 1934. In the late 1930s he served as an Royal Air Force officer, initially as a staff officer at RAF Training Command and then, from July 1941, as a staff officer in the Welfare Section of the RAF Inspector General&#x27;s Staff. He died in the Dunbeath air crash on 25 August 1942, in which fourteen of the fifteen crew and passengers were killed.

==Early life==

Prince George was born on 20 December 1902 at York Cottage on the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, England. His father was the Prince of Wales (later King George V), the only surviving son of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra.

His mother was the Princess of Wales, later Queen Mary, the only daughter and eldest child of the Duke and Duchess of Teck. At the time of his birth, he was fifth in the line of succession to the throne, behind his father and three older brothers: Edward, Albert and Henry.

George was baptised in the Private Chapel at Windsor Castle on 26 January 1903 by Francis Paget, Bishop of Oxford. His godparents were King Edward VII (his paternal grandfather), Prince Valdemar of Denmark (his paternal granduncle, represented by Prince Carl of Denmark, his paternal uncle), Prince Louis of Battenberg (husband of his father&#x27;s cousin), Queen Alexandra (his paternal grandmother), Empress Dowager Maria Feodorovna (his paternal grandaunt, represented by Princess Victoria of the United Kingdom, his paternal aunt), and Princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein (his paternal grandaunt).

==Education and career==

Prince George received his early education from a tutor and then followed his elder brother, Prince Henry, to St Peter&#x27;s Court, a preparatory school at Broadstairs, Kent. At the age of 13, like his brothers, the Prince of Wales, later King Edward VIII and Prince Albert, later King George VI, before him, he went to naval college, first at Osborne and later, at Dartmouth. He was promoted to sub-lieutenant on 15 February 1924, and was promoted to lieutenant on 15 February 1926. He remained on active service in the Royal Navy until March 1929, serving on and later on the flagship of the Atlantic Fleet (renamed the Home Fleet in 1932), . He served on the latter as a lieutenant on the admiral&#x27;s staff before transferring in 1928 to on the America and West Indies Station, based at the Royal Naval Dockyard at Bermuda. His father had previously served at Bermuda on and , as a watch-keeping lieutenant.

After leaving the navy, he briefly held posts at the Foreign Office and later the Home Office, becoming the first member of the royal family to work as a civil servant. He continued to receive promotions after leaving active service: to commander on 15 February 1934 and to captain on 1 January 1937.

From January to April 1931, Prince George and his elder brother the Prince of Wales travelled 18,000 miles on a tour of South America. Their outward voyage was on the ocean liner . In Buenos Aires they opened a British Empire Exhibition. They continued from Río de la Plata to Rio de Janeiro on the liner and returned from Brazil to Europe on the liner , landing at Lisbon. The princes returned via Paris and an Imperial Airways flight from Paris–Le Bourget Airport that landed specially in Windsor Great Park.

On 23 June 1936, George was appointed a personal aide-de-camp to his eldest brother, the new king, Edward VIII. Following the abdication of Edward VIII, he was appointed a personal naval aide-de-camp to his elder brother, now George VI. On 12 March 1937, he was commissioned as a colonel in the British Army and in the equivalent rank of group captain in the Royal Air Force (RAF). He was also appointed as the Colonel-in-Chief of the Royal Fusiliers from the same date.

In October 1938 George was appointed Governor-General of Australia in succession to Lord Gowrie with effect from November 1939. On 11 September 1939 it was announced that, owing to the outbreak of the Second World War, the appointment was postponed.

On 8 June 1939, George was promoted to the ranks of rear admiral in the Royal Navy, major-general in the British Army and air vice-marshal in the Royal Air Force. At the start of the Second World War, George returned to active naval service with the rank of rear admiral, briefly serving in the Intelligence Division of the Admiralty.

He was patron of the Society for Nautical Research between 1926 and 1942.

==Personal life==
===Marriage and children===

On 9 October 1934, in anticipation of his forthcoming marriage to his second cousin, Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark, he was created Duke of Kent, Earl of St Andrews, and Baron Downpatrick. The couple married on 29 November 1934 at Westminster Abbey. This was followed by a Greek ceremony in the private chapel at Buckingham Palace, which was converted into an Orthodox chapel for the liturgy. They had three children:
* Prince Edward, Duke of Kent (born 9 October 1935). He married Katharine Worsley on 8 June 1961. They have three children.
* Princess Alexandra, The Hon. Lady Ogilvy (born 25 December 1936). She married the Hon. Angus Ogilvy, son of David Ogilvy, 12th Earl of Airlie and Lady Alexandra Coke, on 24 April 1963. They had two children.
* Prince Michael of Kent (born 4 July 1942). He married Baroness Marie Christine von Reibnitz on 30 June 1978. They have two children.

===Relationships===
George was rumored to have affairs with musical star Jessie Matthews, writer Cecil Roberts, and Noël Coward, a relationship which Coward&#x27;s long-term partner, Graham Payn, denied. While married, he had an affair with Margaret Whigham, later known as Margaret Campbell, Duchess of Argyll.

George was also rumoured to have been addicted to drugs, especially morphine and cocaine, an allegation which reputedly originated from his friendship with Kiki Preston (née Alice Gwynne, 1898–1946), whom he first met in the mid-1920s. Known as &quot;the girl with the silver syringe&quot; due to her addiction to heroin, Preston – a cousin of railroad heiress Gloria Vanderbilt – was married first to Horace R. B. Allen and then, in 1925, to banker Jerome Preston. She died after jumping out of a window of the Stanhope Hotel in New York City.

His other alleged sexual liaisons include a &quot;ménage à trois&quot; with Preston and José Uriburu, bisexual son of Argentine ambassador to the UK José Uriburu Tezanos.

In addition to his legitimate children, he was said to have had a son by Kiki Preston. According to the memoirs of a friend, Loelia, Duchess of Westminster, Prince George&#x27;s brother Edward VIII believed that the son was Michael Temple Canfield (1926–1969), the adopted son of American publisher Cass Canfield – and the first husband of Lee Radziwill, sister of First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis (wife of President John F. Kennedy).

In an article published in June of 2024, the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; provided a list of the Duke&#x27;s known and suspected romantic partners, while casting doubt on others who have been named at times. The article specifically called into question the factual accuracy of some elements of the article about the Duke in the English language Wikipedia specifically relating to his private life and romantic relationships.

As a young man the Duke came to the opinion that the future lay in aviation. It became his passion, and in 1929, the Duke earned his pilot&#x27;s licence. He was the first of the royal family to cross the Atlantic Ocean by air. Before his flying days, he entered the Royal Navy, and was trained in intelligence work while stationed at Rosyth.

In March 1937, he was granted a commission in the Royal Air Force as a group captain. He was also made the Honorary Air Commodore of No. 500 (County of Kent) Squadron Auxiliary Air Force in August 1938. He was promoted to air vice-marshal in June 1939, along with promotions to flag and general officer rank in the other two services.

In 1939 he returned to active service as a rear admiral in the Royal Navy, but in April 1940, transferred to the Royal Air Force. He temporarily relinquished his rank as an air officer to assume the post of staff officer at RAF Training Command in the rank of group captain, so that he would not be senior to more experienced officers. On 28 July 1941, he assumed the rank of air commodore in the Welfare Section of the RAF Inspector General&#x27;s Staff. In this role, he went on official visits to RAF bases to help boost wartime morale.

==Freemasonry==
Prince George was initiated into freemasonry on 12 April 1928 in Navy Lodge No. 2612. He subsequently served as master of Navy Lodge in 1931, and was also a member of Prince of Wales&#x27;s Lodge No. 259, and Royal Alpha Lodge No. 16, of which he served as master in 1940. He was appointed senior grand warden of the United Grand Lodge of England in 1933, and served as provincial grand master of Wiltshire from 1934, until he was elected grand master of the United Grand Lodge of England in 1939; a position he held until his death in 1942.

==Death==
On 25 August 1942, George and 14 others took off in a RAF Short Sunderland flying boat W4026 from Invergordon, Ross and Cromarty, to fly to Iceland on non-operational duties. The aircraft crashed on Eagle&#x27;s Rock, a hillside near Dunbeath, Caithness, Scotland. George and all but one of those on board were killed. He was 39 years old.

Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince wrote about the crash in their book &quot;Double Standards&quot;, which was criticised for its &quot;implausible inaccuracy&quot;.
They alleged that Kent had a briefcase full of 100 Swedish krona notes, worthless in Iceland, handcuffed to his wrist, leading to speculation the flight was a military mission to Sweden, the only place where Swedish notes were of value.

His death in RAF service marked the first time in more than 450 years that a member of the royal family died on active service. The prince&#x27;s body was transferred initially to St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor, and he was buried in the Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore, directly behind Queen Victoria″s mausoleum. His elder son, six-year-old Prince Edward, succeeded him as Duke of Kent. Princess Marina, his wife, had given birth to their third child, Prince Michael, only seven weeks before Prince George&#x27;s death. His will was sealed in Llandudno in 1943. His estate was valued at £157,735 (or £ in when adjusted for inflation).

One RAF crew member survived the crash: Flight Sergeant Andrew Jack, the Sunderland&#x27;s rear gunner. Flight Sergeant Jack&#x27;s niece has claimed that Jack told his brother that the Duke had been at the controls of the plane; that Jack had dragged him from the pilot&#x27;s seat after the crash; and that there was an additional person on board the plane whose identity has never been revealed.

==In popular culture==

The Duke&#x27;s early life is dramatised in Stephen Poliakoff&#x27;s television serial &quot;The Lost Prince&quot; (2003), a biography of the life of the Duke&#x27;s younger brother John. In the film, the teenage Prince &#x27;Georgie&#x27; is portrayed as sensitive, intelligent, artistic and almost uniquely sympathetic to his brother&#x27;s plight. He is shown as detesting his time at the Royal Naval College and as having a difficult relationship with his austere father.

In May 2008, the BBC aired its Radio 4 comedy &quot;Hut 33&quot;, Series 2, Episode 1, titled &quot;The Royal Visit&quot;. The main guest character for this episode was Duke of Kent, played by Michael Fenton-Stevens. The show is set at Bletchley Park with a team of code breakers. The Duke has been chosen to make an impromptu visit, and the code breakers have been told to hide all evidence of their real work and invent a story. &quot;On no account should the Duke be told what really happens at Bletchley because he is a Nazi spy.&quot; He is also portrayed as promiscuous and bisexual, as he tries to gain sexual favours from one of the male staff, and one of the female characters recalls a previous liaison with the Duke.

Much of George&#x27;s later life was outlined in the documentary film &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Lost Uncle&quot;. He is a recurring character in the revival of &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; (2010/2012), played by Blake Ritson. He is portrayed as a caring brother, terrified of the mistakes that his family is making; later, he is portrayed as an appeaser of the German regime, but also as a supportive friend of Hallam Holland.

George and his eldest brother the Prince of Wales, later Edward VIII, are shown in Stephen Poliakoff&#x27;s BBC television serial &quot;Dancing on the Edge&quot; (2013), in which they are portrayed as supporters of jazz and encouragers of Louis Lester&#x27;s Jazz Band. A sexual attraction to Louis on George&#x27;s part is also insinuated.

<text>The High School of Art and Design is a career and technical education high school in Manhattan, New York City, New York State, United States. Founded in 1936 as the School of Industrial Art, the school moved to 1075 Second Avenue in 1960 and more recently, its Midtown Manhattan location on 56th Street, between Second and Third Avenues, in September 2012. High School of Art and Design is operated by the New York City Department of Education.

==History==
On November 2, 1936, four art teachers began what was to become the High School of Art and Design, the School of Industrial Art, in a former Manhattan elementary school at 257 West 40th Street, which for a time had housed a WPA Federal Theatre Project locale. Initially, they used orange crates and plywood to make storage and desks. One of the co-founders, John B. Kenny, became principal in 1941. The school soon moved to 211 East 79th Street on the Upper East Side, the site of the former annex to Benjamin Franklin High School. In September 1960, the School of Industrial Art changed its name to the High School of Art and Design and moved to 1075 Second Avenue in east Midtown.

The 1936 school was first envisioned as a continuation school, that is, a school where children who had left school and gotten jobs attended for half days to continue their education, normally including vocational classes relevant to their current or possible future jobs. However, it opened as a vocational high school,

On November 8, 2004, a rally was scheduled on the occasion of the school&#x27;s 68th anniversary. This was to include a press conference at which increased support of the school would be urged. On November 8, 2006, the school celebrated its 70th anniversary. The office of the Mayor of New York City issued a proclamation making November 8 &quot;High School of Art and Design Day&quot;.

==Academics and events==
Applicants must take an entrance exam and present a portfolio to be accepted. Freshmen sample all art and design subjects before selecting a major for their sophomore, junior and senior years. Students at Art and Design receive two periods of art instruction per day, choosing from among eight art majors: cartooning, animation, architecture, graphic design, illustration, fashion, photography, and film/video.

Art and Design&#x27;s Kenny Gallery, named for the school&#x27;s founding principal, John B. Kenny, hosts monthly art exhibits of student work. The gallery is open to the public. The Black Box Theatre was donated by the Friends of Art and Design (FAD).

<text>The School of Visual Arts New York City (SVA NYC) is a private for-profit art school in New York City. It was founded in 1947 and is a member of the Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design.

==History==
This school was started by Silas H. Rhodes and Burne Hogarth in 1947 as the Cartoonists and Illustrators School; it had three teachers and 35 students, most of whom were World War II veterans who had a large part of their tuition underwritten by the U.S. government&#x27;s G.I. Bill. It was renamed the School of Visual Arts in 1956 and offered its first degrees in 1972. In 1983, it introduced a Master of Fine Arts in painting, drawing and sculpture.

The school has a faculty of more than 1,100 and a student body of over 3,000. It offers 11 undergraduate and 22 graduate degree programs, and is accredited by the Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools and the National Association of Schools of Art and Design. Its second president, David Rhodes (appointed in 1978), is the son of founder Silas Rhodes.

The interior design BFA is accredited by the Council for Interior Design Accreditation, the art therapy MPS is approved by the American Art Therapy Association, and the art education MA is accredited by the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation.

The current school logo was created in 1997 by George Tscherny for its 50th anniversary, and redesigned in 2013.

In 2019 the school began the process of converting to nonprofit, with the SVA alumni organization (which is already an IRS tax-exempt entity) planning to purchase the school from its owners, who are retiring.

Commencement speakers have included Susan Sontag, Carrie Mae Weems, Gloria Steinem, Roxane Gay, and John Waters.

In 2024, the school received an honorary &quot;SVA Way&quot; co-naming at the intersection of 23rd St. and 3rd Ave. in recognition of its institutional presence in the neighborhood since 1960.

==Continuing education==
The continuing education division offers noncredit courses from most departments; a selection of advertising, branding, cartooning, copywriting, illustration and marketing courses taught in Spanish; professional development and corporate training courses; and summer residency programs.

The school offers short-term study abroad programs in various creative fields.

==Location and campus==
The school has several buildings in the Gramercy Park neighborhood, on Manhattan&#x27;s east side, and in the Chelsea neighborhood, on the west side. There is a residence hall on Ludlow Street, in the Lower East Side. From 1994 to 1997, it had a branch campus in Savannah, Georgia; this was closed following a lawsuit from the Savannah College of Art and Design.

=== Library ===
The library holds books, periodicals, audio recordings, films and other media; the Milton Glaser Design Study Center and Archives, which comprises the collections of Chermayeff &amp; Geismar, Seymour Chwast, Heinz Edelmann, Milton Glaser, Steven Heller, Ed McCabe, James McMullan, Tony Palladino, George Tscherny and Henry Wolf; and the SVA Archives, a repository for materials pertaining to the college&#x27;s history.

===West 21st Street buildings===
The building at 133 to 141 West 21st Street, between Sixth Avenue and Seventh Avenue in Chelsea, has studios for drawing and painting classes, and a small library called Library West which houses books specifically on animation, comics, illustration and art therapy.

The buildings at 132 and 136 West 21st Street have offices, classrooms and studios for art criticism, art education, art therapy, cartooning, computer art, design, illustration and writing. The building at 132 West 21st Street houses the Visible Futures Lab, a workshop featuring traditional and emerging fabrication technology, which regularly hosts artists in residence.

===Residence halls===

There are several residence halls available for students at SVA, including:

*23rd Street Residence (formerly New Residence), at 215 East 23rd Street, is an apartment-style dormitory reserved for new students.
*24th Street Residence, is a 146,000-square-foot, 14-story residence hall that opened in August 2016. The site was purchased by Magnum Real Estate Group and 40 North in April 2015 for $32.25 million from the nonprofit International Center for the Disabled. It houses 505 residents in 242 suites, including office space, and serves as the flagship residence hall for the school.
*Ludlow Residence, at 101 Ludlow Street (abutting Delancey Street), on the Lower East Side, opened in 2009. This tower has 259 single and 47 double rooms.

====Former residence halls====
*George Washington Residence, at 23 Lexington Avenue (between 23rd Street and 24th Street).

=== SVA Galleries ===
SVA maintains three permanent gallery locations across its campus—SVA Gramercy Gallery, SVA Flatiron Gallery, and SVA Chelsea Gallery—which exhibit work from both students and established creative professionals. Every year, the SVA Chelsea Gallery stages an exhibition for its Masters Series recipient, who are honored with both an award and retrospective exhibition. The 2022 Masters Series Recipient was photographer, MacArthur Genius Grant-, and Pulitzer Prize-winner Lynsey Addario for her documentation of civilian life in conflict zones; the retrospective was covered by publications such as the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;.

===Theatre===

The Theatre, also known as the SVA Theatre, is at 333 West 23rd Street, between Eighth Avenue and Ninth Avenue, in Chelsea.

The site was formerly called the 23rd Street Theatre, and served as the home of the Roundabout Theatre Company, from 1972 until 1984; when their lease expired, the venue was converted into a movie theatre, the Clearview Chelsea West Cinema.

It was purchased in 2008, renovated, and reopened in January 2009. Milton Glaser designed the theatre&#x27;s renovated interior and exterior, including the sculpture situated atop its marquee. The facility houses two separate auditoriums, one with 265 seats and one with 480, and hosts class meetings, lectures, screenings and other public events. It has also hosted the red-carpet New York première of Ethan Hawke&#x27;s &quot;The Daybreakers&quot; and a diverse list of world premières, ranging from Lucy Liu&#x27;s 2010 feature documentary &quot;Redlight&quot;, to the 2011 Fox animated comedy &quot;Allen Gregory;&quot; and the 2012 film &quot;The Hunger Games&quot;. In 2013, Beyoncé held a release party and screening for her record-setting, self-titled visual album at the theatre. Community partners that have used the theatre include the Tribeca and GenArt film festivals, Mayor Michael Bloomberg&#x27;s PlaNYC environmental initiative, and the Mayor&#x27;s Office of Film, Theatre &amp; Broadcasting. The theater is also home to the Dusty Film &amp; Animation Festival, held annually since 1990, which showcases the work of emerging filmmakers and animators from the college&#x27;s BFA Film and Video and BFA Animation programs.

<doc id="228953" wikidata="Q2405682" url="?curid=228953" title="Terry Lloyd">
<text>Terence Ellis &quot;Terry&quot; Lloyd (21 November 1952 – 22 March 2003) was an English television journalist who reported extensively from the Middle East. He was killed by the U.S. military while covering the 2003 invasion of Iraq for ITN. An inquest jury in the United Kingdom before Assistant Deputy Coroner Andrew Walker returned a verdict of unlawful killing on 13 October 2006 following an eight-day hearing.

==Early life and education==
Lloyd was born in Derby, Derbyshire, where he worked for Raymonds News Agency, and later moved to become a regional TV reporter for ATV/Central Television. He joined ITN in 1983. His Welsh-born father, Ellis Aled Lloyd, was a police officer who was killed in an accident while answering an emergency call aged 46 in 1970. He was the brother of the television actor Kevin Lloyd, and uncle of James Lloyd, also an actor.

==Career==
In 1988, Lloyd broke the news that Saddam Hussein had used chemical weapons in an attack in Halabja, killing 5,000 Kurds. In 1999, he became the first foreign journalist to enter Kosovo.

==Death==
Lloyd died on 22 March 2003 while covering the 2003 invasion of Iraq for ITN. Working as an independent reporter not &quot;embedded&quot; with coalition forces, Lloyd and his team of two cameramen and an interpreter were caught in crossfire during fighting near the Shatt Al Basra Bridge in Basra, Iraq, between U.S. and Iraqi forces. His body and that of his Lebanese interpreter, Hussein Osman, were recovered and it was later discovered they had both been shot by U.S. forces on the road to Basra. French cameraman Frédéric Nérac is still officially classed as missing, presumed dead. Belgian cameraman Daniel Demoustier survived. Lloyd&#x27;s funeral was reported on ITN news bulletins by Mark Austin on ITV and Samira Ahmed on Channel 4. At a 29 July 2003 &#x27;Embedded Journalist&#x27; symposium in Washington, D.C., journalist John Donvan said he had seen Lloyd in the town of Safwan two hours before he was killed. Donvan also added that his ABC news team ripped &quot;the duct tape off the car … the tape that spelled out in eight-inch letters—TV&quot;, suggesting that both sides of the conflict were targeting independent reporting.

==Investigation==
The Royal Military Police (RMP) carried out an investigation into the incident. Major Kay Roberts, an RMP investigator, testified at Lloyd&#x27;s inquest that a videotape of the incident, taken by a cameraman attached to the U.S. unit that killed him, had been edited before it had been passed on to the British investigation. The RMP forensics expert who examined the tape concluded that about 15 minutes had been removed from the start of the recording. Roberts testified at the inquest that she was sent the tape &quot;some months&quot; after the incident and that she was told by U.S. authorities that the footage they handed over was &quot;everything that they had&quot;.

The ITN team were driving in two cars both clearly marked as press vehicles. Frédéric Nérac and Hussein Osman were in the car behind Lloyd and Daniel Demoustier. They encountered an Iraqi convoy at the Shatt Al Basra Bridge in Basra, Iraq. Nérac and Osman were taken out of their car and made to get into an Iraqi vehicle. The British investigation into the incident established the convoy was escorting a Baath Party leader to Basra. American forces shot at the Iraqi convoy, killing Osman: Nérac&#x27;s body has not been recovered, but the investigation found that he was unlikely to have survived. Frédéric Nérac&#x27;s wife Fabienne Mercier-Nérac testified that she had received a letter from U.S. authorities who denied being at the scene when the ITN News team was attacked.

Demoustier and Lloyd, still in the ITN car, were caught in crossfire between the Iraqi Republican Guard and American forces. Lloyd was hit by an Iraqi bullet, an injury from which he could have recovered. He was put into a civilian minibus that had stopped to pick up casualties. Forensic evidence presented at the inquest shows U.S. forces shot at the minibus after it had turned to leave the area, killing Lloyd outright. Demoustier survived.

==Inquest==
The inquest on Lloyd&#x27;s death was held in October 2006 in Oxfordshire, and lasted eight days, recording the verdict on 13 October 2006. The Assistant Deputy Coroner, Andrew Walker, recorded a verdict of unlawful killing by the U.S. military, and announced he would write to the Director of Public Prosecutions asking for him to investigate the possibility of bringing charges.

Andrew Walker formally cleared ITN of any blame for Lloyd&#x27;s death, and said that in his view the U.S. tanks had been first to open fire on the ITN crew&#x27;s two vehicles. However, in the same document, he says he &quot;was unable to determine whether the bullets that killed Lloyd in southern Iraq on 22 March 2003, were fired by U.S. ground forces or helicopters.&quot; Lloyd &quot;would probably have survived the first [Iraqi] bullet wound&quot; but was killed as he was being carried away from the fighting in the civilian minibus. Walker said: &quot;If the vehicle was perceived as a threat, it would have been fired on before it did a U-turn. This would have resulted in damage to the front of the vehicle. I have no doubt it was the fact that the vehicle stopped to pick up survivors that prompted the Americans to fire on that vehicle.&quot; The National Union of Journalists said Lloyd&#x27;s killing was a war crime.

On 25 October 2006, Liberal Democrats leader Sir Menzies Campbell raised the matter at Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions (PMQs), asking &quot;When may we expect the Attorney-General to make an application for the extradition and trial in Britain of those American soldiers against whom there is a &quot;prima facie&quot; case for the unlawful killing in Iraq of the ITN journalist Terry Lloyd?&quot;

On 19 March 2007, BBC reported that ITN had released the names of the 16 U.S. Marines in the unit involved in Lloyd&#x27;s death. Despite the inquest verdict of unlawful killing, the Crown Prosecution Service decided in July 2008 that there was &quot;insufficient evidence&quot; to prosecute Lloyd&#x27;s killers.

<doc id="228956" wikidata="Q2916311" url="?curid=228956" title="Victoria Day">
<text>Victoria Day () is a federal Canadian public holiday observed on the last Monday preceding May 25 to honour Queen Victoria, who is known as the &quot;Mother of Confederation&quot;. The holiday has existed in Canada since at least 1845, originally on Victoria&#x27;s natural birthday, May 24. It falls on the Monday between the 18th and the 24th (inclusive) and, so, is always the penultimate Monday of May ( in 2025 and in 2026). Victoria Day is a federal statutory holiday, as well as a holiday in six of Canada&#x27;s ten provinces and all three of its territories. The holiday has always been a distinctly Canadian observance and continues to be celebrated across the country. It is informally considered the start of the summer season in Canada.

The same date is also, since 1952, recognized as the currently reigning Canadian monarch&#x27;s official birthday (though, previously, that event had been marked in Canada typically on each monarch&#x27;s actual birthday). In Quebec, before 2003, the Monday preceding May 25 of each year was unofficially the , a commemoration of Adam Dollard des Ormeaux, initiated in the 1920s to coincide with Victoria Day. In 2003, provincial legislation officially created National Patriots&#x27; Day () on the same date.

==History==
Royal birthdays for members of French and British royal families were commemorated in various parts of Canada since the 17th century. These were ad hoc commemorations, rather than holidays enshrined in law. Early commemorations were typically marked by an official ceremony, such as a levee and military review, banquets, and sporting events. Several different days were used to celebrate a sovereign&#x27;s birthday. The birth date for George III, June 4, was observed from the late 18th century to decades after his death in 1820. Until the mid-19th century, the monarch&#x27;s birthday was more of a military occasion than a civil celebration, as it was the day when able-bodied men in the colony assembled into their militia units for their compulsory military training, as well as attended reviews and celebrations in commemoration of the monarch.

Shortly after the Canadas were united into the Province of Canada, the Parliament sought to create a new public holiday that would form common ground between English and French Canadians, helping them transcend their religious and cultural differences. The birthday of Queen Victoria was selected to be transformed into a public holiday, as it was a date that appealed to both English and French Canadians. At the time, loyalty to the Crown was seen as a key trait that distinguished Canada from the United States and the monarchy was viewed as a &quot;guarantor of minority rights&quot; in the colony. The Queen&#x27;s birthday was officially designated as a public holiday by legislation passed in 1845, transforming the date from a military event to a civilian holiday and making it Canada&#x27;s now-oldest official holiday. 
On Victoria&#x27;s 35th birthday, in 1854, some 5,000 residents of Canada West gathered in front of Government House (near present-day King and Simcoe Streets in Toronto) to &quot;give cheers to their queen&quot;. An example of a typical 19th-century celebration of the Queen&#x27;s birthday took place on May 24, 1866, in Omemee, also in Canada West: The town mounted a day-long fête, including pre-dawn serenades, picnics, athletic competitions, a display of illuminations, a torch-light procession, and a gun salute at midnight. By Canadian Confederation in 1867, Victoria Day celebrations were held in communities in Ontario and Quebec and would later spread to other parts of the country as it expanded.

Even as the inhabitants of the Red River Colony, in the then-British territory of Rupert&#x27;s Land, resisted Canadian expansion, clashing with agents of Canada&#x27;s government in 1869 and 1870 as Canada negotiated the purchase of Rupert&#x27;s Land from Britain, the Red River Colony&#x27;s provisional government celebrated Victoria&#x27;s birthday with a show of skill at the militia&#x27;s drill.

The day had become a &quot;patriotic holiday&quot; by the 1890s. Amid the Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee in 1897, the Senate passed a bill that aimed to fix the Queen&#x27;s birthday in perpetuity as a holiday in her honour. It was sent to the House of Commons, where it languished as a private member&#x27;s bill without government support. It was not until after Victoria&#x27;s death in May 1901 that the Queen&#x27;s Birthday was made a perpetual statutory holiday by which to remember the late Queen, who was deemed the &quot;Mother of Confederation&quot;. Some members of Parliament proposed the holiday keep the name &quot;Queen&#x27;s Birthday&quot;, while others proposed changing it to &quot;Queen Victoria Day&quot; or &quot;Victorian Empire Day&quot;. The name &quot;Victoria Day&quot; was selected by Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier, who wanted to avoid an imperialist name that would antagonize French Canadians. The Crown-in-Council, the following year, designated May 24 as the official birthday of King Edward VII. 
Victoria Day served as the King&#x27;s official birthday until 1910, when King George V acceded to the throne. From then until 1952, Victoria Day only honoured Queen Victoria&#x27;s contribution to Canadian Confederation, with the reigning monarch&#x27;s official birthday typically observed in June, instead. However, for King George VI&#x27;s tour of Canada in 1939, the King&#x27;s official birthday was changed to May 20, so he could be present for official festivities; still, Victoria Day was also treated as a day to celebrate the King&#x27;s birthday.

In 1952, the date for Victoria Day was made variable, changing from May 24 to the last Monday before May 25 each year, ensuring that most Canadians would receive a long weekend. The monarch&#x27;s official birthday in Canada was, by annual viceregal proclamations between 1953 and 1956, made to fall on the same day as Victoria Day. On January 31, 1957, the link was made permanent by royal proclamation.

===Relation with Empire Day===
Shortly after Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee in 1898, Clementina Trenholme advocated the creation of Empire Day, a complementary auxiliary event that would occur the weekday before the Queen&#x27;s Birthday. Empire Day was not intended to be a general holiday like Victoria Day, but, was instead intended to provide schools and civic institutions the opportunity to implement activities and lessons on Canada and the British Empire before the monarch&#x27;s official birthday. The event was adopted by several schools in Ontario, Nova Scotia, and Quebec. May 24 was, by imperial decree in 1904, made Empire Day throughout the British Empire. 

In 1958, Empire Day was renamed Commonwealth Day. In 1977, the day was moved to the second Monday in March, ending its association as an &quot;opening act&quot; to Victoria Day in Canada.

===Incidents===
Victoria Day celebrations have been marred by major tragedy at least twice. In 1881, the passenger ferry &quot;Victoria&quot; overturned in the Thames River near London, Ontario. The boat departed in the evening with 600 to 800 people on board—three times the allowed passenger capacity—and capsized partway across the river, drowning some 182 individuals, including a large number of children who had been with their families for Victoria Day picnics at Springbank Park. The event came to be known as the &quot;Victoria Day disaster&quot;.

The Point Ellice Bridge disaster occurred in Victoria, British Columbia, on May 26, 1896, when a bridge collapsed under the weight of a streetcar overloaded with passengers on their way to attend Victoria Day celebrations.

==Provincial and territorial legislation==
Most workplaces in Canada are regulated by the provincial or territorial governments. Therefore, although Victoria Day is a statutory holiday for federal purposes, whether an employee is entitled to a paid day off generally depends on the province or territory of residence (with the exception of employees in federally regulated workplaces such as banks).

The status of Victoria Day in each of the provinces and territories is as follows: It is a general holiday in Alberta, Manitoba, the Northwest Territories, and Yukon and is a statutory holiday in British Columbia, Ontario, and Saskatchewan. Victoria Day is not a paid public holiday but is a government holiday in: Newfoundland and Labrador; Nova Scotia, where it is also not a designated retail closing day, but is considered a &quot;non-statutory holiday&quot;; and Prince Edward Island, although provincial legislation defines &quot;holiday&quot; to include Victoria Day. In Nunavut and New Brunswick, the date is set as a general holiday (for New Brunswick, a prescribed day of rest on which retail businesses must be closed) to mark the reigning sovereign&#x27;s official birthday.

Beginning in the 1920s, French Canadians in Quebec informally called the May holiday , after Adam Dollard des Ormeaux, an early colonist of New France. In 2002, the provincial government of Quebec replaced with National Patriots&#x27; Day, which commemorates the patriotes of the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837.
==Practice==
Canada is the only country that commemorates Queen Victoria with an official holiday. Federal government protocol dictates that, on Victoria Day, the Royal Union Flag is to be flown from sunrise to sunset at all federal government buildings—including airports, military bases, and other Crown owned property across the country—where physical arrangements allow (i.e. where a second flag pole exists, as the Royal Union Flag can never displace the national flag).

Several cities hold a parade on the holiday, with the most prominent being that which has taken place since 1898 in the monarch&#x27;s namesake city of Victoria, British Columbia. In nearby New Westminster, the Victoria Day weekend is distinguished by the Hyack Anvil Battery Salute, a tradition created during colonial times as a surrogate for a 21-gun salute: Gunpowder is placed between two anvils, the top one upturned, and the charge is ignited, hurling the upper anvil into the air. Other celebrations include an evening fireworks show, such as that held at Ashbridge&#x27;s Bay Beach in the east end of Toronto, and at Ontario Place, in the same city.
In Ottawa, the traditional Trooping the Colour ceremony takes place on Parliament Hill or occasionally at Rideau Hall. The reviewing officer in the ceremony is the monarch, with members of the royal family, the governor general, the minister of national defence, or the chief of the defence staff taking the sovereign&#x27;s place in their absence. The participating units in the parade include personnel of the Governor General&#x27;s Foot Guards and The Canadian Grenadier Guards, both of which are part of the ad hoc Ceremonial Guard.

Across the country, Victoria Day serves as the unofficial marker of the end of the winter social season and, thus, the beginning of the summer social calendar. Banff, Alberta&#x27;s Sunshine Village ends its lengthy ski season on Victoria Day and, likewise, it is during this long weekend that many summer businesses—such as parks, outdoor restaurants, bicycle rentals, city tour operators, etc.—will open. Victoria Day is also a mark of the beginning of the cottage season, when cottage owners may reverse the winterization of their property. Gardeners in Canada will similarly regard Victoria Day as the beginning of spring, as it falls at a time when one can be fairly certain that frost will not return until the next autumn. There is also a change in fashion: lighter-coloured summer clothing was traditionally worn from Victoria Day through to Labour Day.
The holiday is colloquially known in parts of Canada as &quot;May Two-Four&quot;, a double entendre that refers both to the date around which the holiday falls (May 24) and the Canadian slang for a case of twenty-four beers (a &quot;two-four&quot;), a drink popular during the long weekend. The holiday weekend may also be known as the &quot;May long weekend&quot;, &quot;May Long&quot;, or in Timmins and surrounding areas, &quot;May Run&quot;. The term &quot;Firecracker Day&quot; was also once employed in Ontario.

A traditional, short song about Victoria Day went as follows: &quot;The twenty-fourth of May / Is the Queen&#x27;s birthday; / If they don&#x27;t give us a holiday / We&#x27;ll all run away!&quot; The holiday is referenced in the song &quot;Lakeside Park&quot; by Canadian rock band Rush, from their 1975 album &quot;Caress of Steel&quot;. The song features the line, &quot;everyone would gather on the 24th of May, sitting in the sand to watch the fireworks display&quot;.

==Petition to change name==

In 2013, an online petition was circulated to rename the holiday &quot;Victoria and First Peoples Day&quot;, to provide Canadians with an opportunity to honour both the Crown and the Indigenous peoples of Canada, which share a relationship. While a group of prominent Canadian actors, authors, and politicians sent the petition to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, in total the petition did not get enough traction for any change to occur.

<doc id="228964" wikidata="Q706198" url="?curid=228964" title="Taiwan High Speed Rail">
<text>Taiwan High Speed Rail (THSR) is the high-speed railway network in Taiwan, which consists of a single line that runs approximately along the western coast of the island, from the capital Taipei in the north to the southern city of Kaohsiung. With construction and operations managed by a private company, Taiwan High Speed Rail Corporation (THSRC), which also operates the line, the total cost of the project was billion in 1998. The system&#x27;s technology is based primarily on Japan&#x27;s Shinkansen.

The railway opened for service on 5 January 2007, with trains running at a top speed of , currently running from Nangang to Zuoying in as little as 1 hour and 45 minutes, reaching almost 90% of Taiwan&#x27;s population. Most intermediate stations on the line lie outside the cities served; however, a variety of transfer options, such as free shuttle buses, conventional rail, and metros have been constructed to facilitate transport connections.

Ridership initially fell short of forecasts, but grew from fewer than 40,000 passengers per day in the first few months of operation to over 129,000 passengers per day in June 2013. Daily passenger traffic reached 130,000 in 2014, well below the forecast of 240,000 daily passengers for 2008. The system carried its first 100 million passengers by August 2010 and over 200 million passengers had taken the system by December 2012, followed by 400 million by December 2016. THSR, or railways in general, is only located on the main island of Taiwan. Outer islands under the control of the ROC government including Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu do not have railways.

In the initial years of operation, THSRC accumulated high debts due to high depreciation charges and interest, largely due to the financial structure set up for the private company. In 2009, THSRC negotiated with the government to change the method of depreciation from depending on concessions on rights to ridership. At the same time, the government also started to help refinance THSRC&#x27;s loans to assist the company so it could remain operational and profitable. The government injected NT$30 billion as a financial bailout, boosting the government&#x27;s stake to about 64% from about 37%. The government also extended the rail concession from 35 years to 70 years and terminated the company&#x27;s build-operate-transfer business model.

==History==
Taiwan&#x27;s rapid economic growth during the latter half of the twentieth century led to congestion of highways, conventional rail, and air traffic systems in the western transport corridor, which threatened to impede the region&#x27;s development. The idea of a new high-speed rail line arose in the 1970s, and informal planning began in 1980. In 1987, the executive branch of Taiwan&#x27;s government, the Executive Yuan, instructed the Ministry of Transportation to launch a feasibility study for a high-speed rail line in the western Taiwan corridor, which was completed in 1990. The study found that in a comparison of potential solutions to traffic problems in the corridor, a high-speed rail line would offer the highest transit volume, lowest land use, highest energy savings, and least pollution. In July 1990 the Preparation Office of High Speed Rail (POHSR) was established and a route was selected in 1991. Plans for the THSR were subsequently approved by the Executive Yuan in June 1992 and by Taiwan&#x27;s legislature, the Legislative Yuan, in 1993.

===Build-Operate-Transfer===
In November 1994, Taiwan passed a law regarding the use of private finance in infrastructure projects, which also applied to the up-to-then state-run THSR project. Consequently, in 1995, POHSR was transformed into the Bureau of High Speed Rail (BOHSR), which started to tender THSR as a build-operate-transfer (BOT) scheme in October 1996.

The bidding process pitted Taiwan High Speed Rail Consortium (THSRC) against the Chunghwa High Speed Rail Consortium (CHSRC). THSRC&#x27;s bid was based on the high-speed technology platform of Eurotrain, a joint venture between GEC-Alsthom, the main maker of the French TGV, and Siemens, the main maker of the German ICE, while CHSRC&#x27;s bid was based on Japanese Shinkansen technology supplied by Taiwan Shinkansen Consortium (TSC), a joint venture of Japanese companies. THSRC, which submitted the lower bid and promised to build the line with zero net cost from the government, was chosen as the preferred bidder in September 1997. The group was renamed and formally established as the Taiwan High Speed Rail &quot;Corporation&quot; (THSRC) in May 1998. THSRC and the government signed the BOT agreement on 23 July 1998.

However, controversy arose during rolling-stock selection. In May 1999, as THSRC faced difficulties in raising capital, the government of Japan promised soft loans if THSRC switched to TSC. Although Eurotrain promised to match TSC&#x27;s financial proposal, the Eschede train disaster in combination with TSC offering the newer 700 Series Shinkansen, convinced THSRC to reopen its core system bid, ultimately resulting in TSC selected as the preferred rolling-stock supplier in December 1999. Although Eurotrain eventually conceded in the bid, in February 2001 it filed for a US$800 million damage claim against THSRC at the Singapore International Arbitration Centre. After a lengthy arbitration process, the court ruled in March 2004 that THSRC should pay a compensation for the US$32.4 million Eurotrain spent on development and US$35.7 million for unjust enrichment. THSRC agreed to pay US$65 million (US$89 million with interest) to Eurotrain in November 2004.

=== Construction ===
Construction of the line by THSRC officially started in March 1999. Tunnels and other major civil engineering works were completed by 2004, along with the first delivery of the 700T trains. Testing and commissioning of the line then took place in 2005 and 2006, with a maximum testing speed of achieved in October 2005.

===Opening===

The railway was opened in 2007, with limited commercial services between Banqiao and Zuoying stations from 5 January, with full service from Taipei Station to Kaohsiung from May 2007.

Three additional stations located along the line – Miaoli, Changhua and Yunlin – opened in 2015.

=== Future plans ===
==== Southern extension ====
On 10 September 2019, the Executive Yuan announced that the railway would be expanded to Pingtung. Out of four proposed route options, it was confirmed on 27 September that the expansion would bypass central Kaohsiung, branching from Zuoying east towards western Pingtung City, near , with an estimated cost of NT$55.4 billion. Although lowest in cost, the option was met with criticism regarding its economic benefits.

The extension to Pingtung was approved by Premier Su Tseng-chang in January 2023, with opening of the extension planned for 2029.

On 28 December 2024, Executive Yuan announced that the extension route would be altered to pass through the city centre with a stop at Kaohsiung Main Station.

==== Northern extension ====
The line was extended from Taipei to Nangang, opening in July 2016.

On 25 October 2019, the Railway Bureau published an assessment report to extend the line further from Taipei to Yilan, cutting travel time to 13 minutes. The extension was approved in October 2020, and is planned to open by 2030.

==Rolling stock==
===THSR 700T===
Taiwan High Speed Rail started operation with 30 THSR 700T trainsets supplied by a consortium led by Kawasaki Heavy Industries. In response to increasing ridership and new stations that would begin operation in 2015, THSRC signed the contract for four new 700T trainsets with the Kawasaki consortium in May 2012 in Tokyo, Japan. The first (TR 31) trainset was delivered to Taiwan on 23 December 2012; the second (TR 32) on 21 January 2013; the third (TR33) on 25 January 2014; the fourth (TR34) on 12 August 2015.

The THSR 700T trainset is based on the 700 Series Shinkansen trainset used by JR Central and JR West in Japan. This marked the first time Shinkansen technology was exported to a foreign country, and it involved &quot;rolling stock derived from a JR Central design running on both the European and Japanese track systems.&quot; Customization was focused on adapting to Taiwan&#x27;s climate and geography, and the nose shape was optimized for tunnels wider than those in Japan.

The maximum service speed of the trains was raised from the 700 Series Shinkansen&#x27;s . The 12 cars of a 700T train are grouped in three traction units with three power cars and one trailer each, providing of power; both end cars are trailers to avoid slip on powered bogies. The train is long and has a mass of when empty. The trains have a passenger capacity of 989 seats in two classes: 66 seats in 2+2 configuration in the single Business Car and 923 seats in 2+3 configuration in the eleven Standard Cars. The per capita energy consumption of a fully loaded 700T train is 16% of that of private cars and half that of buses; carbon dioxide emissions are 11% of private cars and a quarter that of buses.

=== N700S ===

In the late 2010s, THSRC began work to purchase additional high speed trains, in light of growing demand. 12 trains would be ordered, at a cost of around NT$30 billion. Due to the limited number of Japanese companies who build Shinkansen rolling stock, it took several years for THSRC to agree an acceptable deal. In 2022, it was reported that THSRC was speaking to European train manufacturers instead, as the price offered by Japanese companies was &quot;unreasonable&quot;.

In March 2023, it was announced that a joint bid by Hitachi and Toshiba had been awarded the contract. Twelve of the latest generation of Shinkansen train—the N700S Series—would be delivered at a cost of NT$28 billion.

=== Engineering trains ===
THSRC uses overhead line inspection trains from Windhoff, Harsco railgrinders, Plasser &amp; Theurer track tampers, and several ex-JR rolling stock to maintain its line. Among the latter include the JNR Class DD14 and JNR Class DD16 diesel-hydraulic locomotives, which were originally used for snowploughing by JR. The two ex-JR locomotives with THSRC are equipped with Shinkansen-style rotary couplers and standard-gauge bogies instead of the original gauge bogies and knuckle couplers and are used for shunting the 700T trainsets within the depot. THSRC also uses a former 0 Series Shinkansen end car as a structure gauge test car.

== Operation ==
As the first high speed railway system in Taiwan, THSRC started operation in 2007 with many foreign employees, including French and German train drivers and operation controllers in the Operation Control Center (OCC). At the same time, THSRC also started to train local drivers and controllers. Since May 2008, all controllers working in the OCC have been Taiwanese, and since October 2008, all train drivers have been Taiwanese.

The OCC&#x27;s main responsibility is to maintain safe train operations. THSRC has 132 controllers (July 2012), of which about one quarter are female, working 24 hours per day and 365 days per year in the OCC. Requirements for becoming a Chief Controller (主任控制員) include experience in all nine OCC positions, 300-hours of on-the-job training and acquiring qualification.

THSRC has 144 drivers (July 2012), of which almost 10% are female. All driver candidates must spend 8 months completing 1,326 hours of professional training and pass the National Certification before they can drive the train. In addition, after becoming a certified high-speed train driver, they undergo further on-the-job training at least three times each year in order to guarantee they can drive the train safely.

===Natural disasters===
Taiwan frequently faces multiple types of natural disasters, including typhoons, earthquakes, heavy rainfall, floods, and landslides. For this reason, a primary focus of THSRC&#x27;s infrastructure design was how to respond to natural disasters such as earthquakes and how to ensure safety for all passengers and trains in any emergency situation.

THSRC has established a system to respond to natural disasters and unexpected intrusion onto the right-of-way, called DWS (Disaster Warning Systems). This system consists of a network of sensors installed along the rail route to detect unexpected situations such as earthquakes, strong winds, heavy rainfall, floods, landslides, and intrusions. In case of an unexpected situation, the DWS will send signals to the OCC (Operation Control Center) immediately; it will also activate contingency measures to ensure the safety of the passengers and trains, including decelerating or stopping trains in the affected area.

The DWS has functioned successfully since its initial operation in 2007. The most powerful earthquake that THSRC has experienced measured 6.4 on the Richter Scale with an epicenter from Jiaxian, Kaohsiung that shook southern Taiwan on 4 March 2010 (甲仙地震). One operating train was slightly derailed in Sinshih, Tainan, and six trains were stopped on the track. In spite of the temporary suspension of operations, there was no damage or casualties. All 2,500 affected passengers were evacuated in two hours without injury. Service resumed the next day. Such a record was well noted, and provided valuable experience in operational safety to the global railway industry.

In April 2010, it was reported that subsidence had been observed during construction on a viaduct section in Yunlin County. The subsidence continued, reaching up to over seven years. By 2010 subsidence had slowed, which was ascribed to the closure of some deep groundwater wells operating in the region. Although the situation was deemed safe with differential settlement between adjacent piers along the viaduct at only a sixth of the permissible level, the BOHSR urged the closure of more wells. On 25 July 2011, the government announced plans to close almost 1,000 wells in Changhua and Yunlin counties, reducing the amount of water pumped from deep wells by by 2021.

==Service==

According to THSR&#x27;s July 2018 timetable, there are 989 train services per week of operation, with operation times between 05:50 to 24:00 every day. Most southbound trains originate from Nangang station and most northbound trains originate from Zuoying; however, a few trains operate just between Nangang and Taichung or between Taichung and Zuoying. Southbound trains are designated by odd train numbers, and northbound trains by even train numbers.

Each train consists of 1 business car (car 6) and 11 standard cars (including reserved seats and non-reserved seats). Since July 2010, non-reserved seats are available in cars 10 through 12 (some trains available in cars 9 through 12 or available in cars 8 through 12 ). Car 7 of each train is fitted with 4 wheelchair accessible chairs and a disabled-friendly restroom. Passengers can call THSR&#x27;s Customer Service Hot Line at (Taiwan) 4066-3000 or visit any THSR station ticket window to reserve these seats.

By August 2012, implementation of 4G WiMAX on-board trains is expected to provide smooth wireless broadband services, making THSR the first high-speed ground transportation system equipped with this service.

In 2012, THSRC rated highly in the CommonWealth Magazine (天下雜誌) &quot;Golden Service Award survey&quot; (金牌服務大賞), not only far outpacing all rivals in the &quot;long-distance land transport&quot; category, but also taking the top spot in the overall rankings of 300 industries.

===Local connections===
To improve local public transit connections to THSR stations, the TRA built two new spur lines branching off from West Coast Line.
*Shalun Line for Tainan opened on 2 January 2011,
*Liujia Line for Hsinchu opened on 11 November 2011.

===Stop patterns===
With a few exceptions, the services follow the below pattern.
===Ticket fare and discount===
As of January 2018, a one-way Taipei–Zuoying trip, a THSR standard car adult ticket is NT$1490, and a business car ticket fare is NT$1950. The cost of a non-reserved seat is approximately 3% less than the regular price. Business and standard car reserved ticket reservations are available 28 days prior to the date of departure (including the departure day).

Senior citizens (Taiwan citizens above 65 years of age), registered disabled persons plus one accompanying passenger (Taiwan citizens only), and children (passengers under 12 years of age) are eligible for concession (half price) tickets.

A group discount is offered for groups of 11 or more. A group discount cannot be used in combination with other discount offers and does not include non-reserved seats. Passengers eligible for multiple discounts can only choose one discount offer.

Since 1 July 2010, a smart card system has provided frequent travelers with multi-ride (eight trips) or periodic tickets. THSR&#x27;s contact-less smart cards allow the cardholder to travel between specific stations within a given time period for a certain number of rides. The card is sold in either registered (name-bearing) or non-registered form. Only adult tickets are available in this format, and cannot be used for rides between Banqiao and Taipei.

After purchasing or adding value to a multi-ride card, the card balance is valid for 45 days counted from the day of first use. The ticket is good for 8 rides. The multi-ride card provides a discount of about 21% off the full fare of a reserved Standard Seat. Non-registered and registered multi-ride tickets can be purchased at the ticket windows of all THSRC stations. Upon first purchase of a multi-ride ticket, a card deposit fee of NT$100 is required (refundable if the card is returned). The registered multi-ride ticket is limited to personal use by the registered cardholder.
Since November 2012, an Early Bird discount of 35% has been offered for a limited number of tickets sold no later than 8 days before the departure date. If the 35% off tickets sell out before the deadline, tickets with a discount of 20% off are offered. If these tickets sell out before the deadline, tickets with a discount of 10% off are offered. If all early bird tickets are sold out, then full fare tickets are offered.

===Train frequency===

THSRC operates additional train services during national holidays. On 29 June 2011, a proposal by THSRC to increase the maximum number of train services to 210 per day (compared to the existing 175 per day) passed an environmental impact assessment, increasing the number of possible services on &quot;high-load days&quot;.

===Ridership===

Original estimates predicted a daily ridership of 180,000 after launch, growing to 400,000 by 2036. In view of a 50% drop in airline passengers in the wake of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, forecasts were revised downwards. The final initial ridership estimate was 140,000 passengers per day. Actual initial ridership did not match these projections. In September 2007, six months after opening, THSRC carried 1.5 million passengers monthly, translating to about 50,000 passengers daily. In the second year, passenger numbers almost doubled. In the third year, average daily ridership continued to grow to 88,000 passengers per day, jumping to over 120,000 passengers per day in 2012. (updated to September 2012) Seat occupancy was around 45% in the first three years, with a modest improvement achieved in 2009, and reached 53.91% in 2012. (updated to September 2012) Punctuality is stable above 99%.

The 10-millionth passenger was carried after 265 days of operation on 26 September 2007, while the 100-millionth passenger was carried after 1,307 days on 3 August 2010, and 200-millionth by December 2012. On 10 October 2011, the Double Ten Day holiday, THSRC transported a single-day record of 189,386 passengers. On 5 February 2011, the third day of Chinese New Year’s celebration, a new record of 190,596 passengers was achieved. The next single-day record was reached on 25 January 2012, also the third day of Chinese New Year&#x27;s celebration, at 191,989 passengers. The most recent record is 212,000 passengers transported on 1 January 2013.

The high-speed trains have successfully out-competed planes: by August 2008, half of the air routes between Taipei and the country&#x27;s western cities had been discontinued, including all connections between cities with THSR stations except for a single daily connection between Taipei and Kaohsiung. Total domestic air traffic was expected to be halved from 2006 to 2008, and actually fell from 8.6 to 4.9 million. In June 2012, officials announced the discontinuation of the last remaining commercial flight between Taipei and Kaohsiung. The share for conventional rail between Taipei and Kaohsiung fell from 9.71% in 2006 to 2.5% in 2008, while high-speed rail became the most common mode of transport at 50% of all trips by 2008. The opening of THSR led to a 10% reduction of traffic on the parallel expressway in 2007. Despite cheaper ticket prices, long-distance bus companies reported that passenger volumes had fallen by 20 to 30 percent by 2008.

==Infrastructure==
Construction of the system took more than 2,000 professional engineers from 20 countries and over 20,000 foreign and domestic workers six years to complete. Construction work was broken into several specialized lots that were contracted separately. One group of contracts was for civil works, covering the construction of the superstructure of open line sections. Stations and depots were the subject of separate groups of construction contracts. A fourth group of contracts was for track work.

The Taiwan North-South High Speed Rail Project was awarded the first prize for the Outstanding Civil Engineering Project Award by the Asian Civil Engineering Coordination Council (ACECC) in Sydney in 2010.

In 2011, the Public Construction Commission (公共工程委員會) organized an on-line voting campaign that garnered over 330,000 votes, to select the 100 best infrastructure projects (百大建設) in Taiwan to celebrate the centennial of the Republic; Taiwan High Speed Rail topped the list.

===Track===
Reflecting a design speed of , track layout was designed with a minimum curve radius of , track-centre distance of , right-of-way width of , and a maximum gradient of 2.5%, except for 3.5% at one location. All but of track is ballastless, combining slab track of Japanese manufacture on open line sections with switches from a German supplier. Track laying began in July 2003. The line was electrified with the 25 kV/60 Hz AC system. The signalling and train control system was laid out for bi-directional operation according to European specifications. Each track section has a checkpoint, and an automatic control system ensures that trains are spaced at least apart to prevent collisions.

Most of the line is elevated. About or 73% of the line runs on viaducts, mostly precast pre-stressed concrete box girder spans, the first of which was put in place in October 2001.

The Changhua-Kaohsiung Viaduct is a continuous section from Baguashan (八卦山) in Changhua County to Zuoying in Kaohsiung. It was the second longest bridge in the world as of 2017. Viaducts were designed to be earthquake resistant to allow for trains to stop safely during a seismic event and for repairable damage following a maximum design earthquake. Bridges built over known fault lines were designed to survive fault movements without catastrophic damage.

About or 18% of the line is in tunnels, including of the TRUPO section in Taipei, as well as 48 tunnels with a total length of on the other sections, the longest of which is Paghuashan Tunnel, at a finished length of . Forty-two of the tunnels included a total of of mined sections, all of which were bored with the sequential excavation and support construction method, with excavated tunnel faces of , between November 2000 and July 2003. The finished interior cross-sectional area of , set according to wider European standards, provides space for two tracks with safety walkways.

After four months of delays, trial runs using the first THSR 700T trains began on 27 January 2005, on the Tainan–Kaohsiung section. On 30 October 2005, a day after a test run passed the planned top service speed of , the targeted maximum test speed of was achieved. The section between Banqiao (Taipei) and Zuoying (Kaohsiung) opened to the public on 5 January 2007. The HSR platforms at Taipei Station opened on 2 March 2007, bringing the entire line into operation.

===Stations===
A distinctive feature of the system&#x27;s station placement is that many are located at the periphery of urban areas, rather than within city centers. The decision was made with the expectation that the stations would act as centers for planned communities and thus increase the property values of the surrounding area. A study in 2010 showed that this isn&#x27;t the case, but later analyses show that property prices around certain stations have indeed risen. Since the THSR&#x27;s opening, cities have gradually expanded their mass transit systems to connect with these stations.

===Environmental issues===

 Environmental mitigation measures in the line&#x27;s construction phase included the construction of animal bridges over the line, the planting and re-planting of trees along the track as noise screens, and the purchase of farmland to create a preservation area for jacana birds away from the line.

THSRC is involved in the preservation of the pheasant-tailed jacana, which is considered endangered in Taiwan. An artificial habitat recovery project was completed in collaboration with the local government, country development organizations and non-profit organizations for a cost of NT$50 million. In 2007, the recovery habitat was officially renamed the &quot;Pheasant-tailed Jacana Eco-Educational Nature Park&quot; and since then, it has opened to the public. THSRC arranges for elementary and junior high school students to visit the park annually.

 A 330 year old camphor tree and a temple in Hsinchu County are located on the main route of the THSR, and both of them faced removal because of railway construction. The temple established beside the old tree serves as a major religious site for the local community. In 1998, THSRC adjusted the line and design to keep the tree and temple in their original place and cooperated with the local government and people to protect the old tree and the temple until today. Afterwards, together with the local government, the Environment and the Resources Protection Committee, and cultural and historical authorities, THSRC drafted the Hsinchu Old Camphor Tree Medical Plan, which called for the repair of decayed branches as well as measures designed to maintain the long-term growth and the health of the tree.

==Financial==

===Revenue and cost===
Most of THSRC&#x27;s revenue comes from ticket sales; supplemental income comes from other activities such as advertising and renting spaces for standing shops and spots in plazas. Advertising spots on trains and station platforms have also been sold.
Revenues grew along with ridership over the first three years, but ridership remained below expectations. In 2008 the second year of operation, revenues fell barely short of THSRC&#x27;s expectations a year earlier of a doubling of first-year results.

The cost of running the trains and infrastructure, or cash operating costs, was initially over NT$1 billion a month, but was reduced to around NT$850–900 million in 2008. Revenues first exceeded this level, thus generating a positive operating cash flow, in the fourth month of operation (April 2007).

For THSRC, the over heavy accounting of the fixed cost of fixed assets like rolling stock and infrastructure (depreciation) is a significant non-cash element of total operating costs. In its first two years of operation, THSRC applied straight-line depreciation, distributing costs evenly over a period of 26.5 years. As a result, the balance of operating revenues and costs (operating income) showed a high loss in the first year of operation, which was only reduced as revenues grew in the second year. The depreciation period set for THSRC reflected the length of the B.O.T. concession rather than the much longer lifespan of the infrastructure, and it is the factor for the operating loss. After adopting an activity depreciation method which is variable in time, THSRC posted its first operating profit for 2009, the third year of operation. The company reported its first annual profit of NT$5.78 billion after five years of operation.

For the first time in its five-year operation, the Company reported a net income of NT$5.78 billion, with earnings per share of NT$0.59. Revenues increased by 16.65% from NT$27.64 billion to NT$32.24 billion, with operating costs and expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) rising by only 4.98%. Over the same period of time, gross profit totaled NT$12.98 billion (an increase of 30.32%), income from operations totaled NT$12.06 billion (an increase of 32.93%) and EBITDA totaled NT$22.73 billion (an increase of 22.34%). 2011 gross profit, income from operation and EBITDA were all record highs. Since commencing operations in 2007, THSRC has had a significant influence on Taiwan&#x27;s economy and on the lives of its people. In 2011, the Company continued to pursue sustainable growth aligned with the interests of shareholders and society, achieving record profits even amid a challenging economic environment.

The interest cost is another major item of this company&#x27;s financing. In the first few years of operation, interest rates were well above market rates. Interest expense per month stood at around NT$1.3 billion in 2008, when THSRC first achieved break-even cash flow, with revenue and cash expenses (which exclude depreciation) both around NT$2.1 billion in 2008. Interest rates fell in the first half of 2009, reducing interest expenses and contributing to a reduced net loss.

In 2010, THSRC obtained a new syndicate loan to alleviate its imminent financial burden. The company signed a NT$382 billion refinancing contract with a consortium of eight domestic banks led by the Bank of Taiwan, and used the new loan to pay off the previous syndicated loan, which had higher interest. , the long-term debts totalling NT$385 billion included NT$26 billion in corporate bonds and NT$359 billion in bank loans. In comparison with the terms and conditions of previous loans, the refinancing debts carried lower interest rates and longer tenors, up to 22 years.

===Financial and loan===
In cumulative figures, until July 2008, depreciation and interest were equal to 95% of THSRC&#x27;s accumulated debt. Both THSRC and a September 2009 government report identified an unreasonable financial structure and the resulting high interest rates and high depreciation charges as the main causes of negative financial performance, while the government assessed THSRC to have performed well in its core business, as measured by earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). To reduce its interest load, THSRC sought to revise its loan structure in 2008 and again in 2009. To reduce depreciation costs by increasing the amortization time, THSRC requested an extension of its 35-year concession period.

By the summer of 2009, THSRC&#x27;s cumulative losses were equivalent to two-thirds of its equity capital. In response to global financial crisis and domestic economic recession, THSRC proposed to increase income and reduce expenditures in several aspects in the hope of raising operation performances. In February 2009, THSRC announced to adjust train frequency, cut down salary payment by 10~20% among management level, and measured to expand fare promotion to stimulate ridership.
While the media questioned whether the planned construction of three more intermediate stations and the extension to Nangang would be postponed, THSRC published press release on 28 September 2009, stating that the company will comply with &quot;Taiwan High Speed. Rail Construction and Operation Contract&quot;, and the construction project of 3 intermediate stations, namely Miaoli, Changhua and Yunlin will be initiated in July 2012, and is scheduled to start its operation from 2015. By the time of completion, there will be a total of 12 stations along the THSRC operation route. The company was put under new management in September 2009 with the aim of turning around the company&#x27;s finances with government help in arranging refinancing of the loans.

The government took majority control of the company after the election of its new board on 10 November 2009. In January 2010, when accumulated losses already exceeded NT$70 billion, THSRC signed a government-guaranteed refinancing deal in which eight government-dominated banks provided NT$382 billion at lower interest rates and longer maturity. The government also approved the company&#x27;s new variable depreciation charge.

==Incidents==
On 12 April 2013, suspicious luggage items were found inside the North bound train No. 616 toilet when it was heading towards THSR Hsinchu Station. The train was stopped at THSR Taoyuan Station and all of the passengers were evacuated. Later, it was determined the luggage contained an unidentified liquid in cans, alarm clock and white particulate matter. The items were dismantled by the bomb squad and taken for further investigation. Two KMT legislators, Hsu Hsin-ying and Lu Shiow-yen, were on board.

Part of the tracks near Tainan were badly damaged during the earthquake on 6 February 2016. All high-speed rail services south of Chiayi Station were suspended until 7 February 2016.

On 10 May 2017, a non-passenger carrying train traveled in the opposite direction of the track from Zuoying to Tainan for due to human negligence.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the THSR, along with Taiwan Railway Administration and bus services nationwide, began to require all passengers to wear surgical masks as of 1 April. In addition, infrared sensors were set up at twelve stations to detect fevers, eating and drinking were prohibited on board the trains, trains and stations were disinfected more frequently, and the THSR cancelled all non-reserved seating tickets, which allowed for crowds of passengers to stand if no seats were available. It was reported that the switch to reserved seats only aimed to reduce crowding.

==Public relations activities==
THSRC conducts community engagement activities to raise its profile.

Since 2009, the company has organized an annual &quot;Ride THSR and Join the Book Exhibition for Free&quot; event to promote a national reading culture; school-age passengers from remote villages are given free admission to the Taipei International Book Exhibition and go there on a themed high-speed &quot;reading train&quot;, which features a celebrity reading a book over the train&#x27;s public address system.

Since 2010, along with World Vision Taiwan, THSRC has run a tuition fee assistance program for thousands of underprivileged children, to which passengers contribute.

Other events have been a cappella singers at stations; gift-giving to couples taking wedding photos at major stations; station tours for the public and experience-sharing with its fellow railway transportation operators; and in collaboration with non-profit organizations, thousands of free rides to underprivileged groups and families.

Students at primary, secondary and tertiary level learn about high-speed rail and THSRC at &quot;THSR Camps&quot;, held in partnership with the Railway Cultural Society of Taiwan, the National Chiao Tung University Railway Research Society, and the China Youth Corps.

==In popular culture==
The first film to feature THSR prominently was the 2007 Taiwanese movie &quot;Summer&#x27;s Tail&quot;, directed by Cheng Wen-tang ().

&quot;&quot;, a 2007 train simulator video game developed jointly by Taiwanese company Actainment and Japanese company Ongakukan on the basis of the latter&#x27;s Train Simulator series, featured real video and was the first Taiwanese game for Sony Computer Entertainment&#x27;s PlayStation 3 system.
The &quot;National Geographic&quot; website chose travel by Taiwan&#x27;s high speed train as the &quot;Best winter trip” in 2013.

<doc id="228972" wikidata="Q2064362" url="?curid=228972" title="Battle of Texel">
<text>The naval Battle of Texel or Battle of Kijkduin took place off the western coast of the island of Texel on 21 August 1673 (11 August O.S.) between the Dutch and the combined English and French fleets. It was the last major battle of the Third Anglo-Dutch War, which was itself part of the Franco-Dutch War (1672–1678), during which Louis XIV of France invaded the Republic and sought to establish control over the Spanish Netherlands. English involvement came about because of the Treaty of Dover, secretly concluded by Charles II of England, and which was highly unpopular with the English Parliament.

The overall commanders of the English and Dutch military forces were Lord High Admiral James, Duke of York, later James II, and Admiral-General William III of Orange, his son-in-law and another future King of England. Neither of them took part in the fight.

Prince Rupert of the Rhine commanded the Allied fleet of more than 100 warships and 28 fireships, taking control of the centre himself, with Jean II d&#x27;Estrées commanding the van, and Sir Edward Spragge the rear division. The Dutch fleet of 75 warships and 22 fireships was commanded by Lieutenant-Admiral-General Michiel de Ruyter, with Lieutenant-Admirals Adriaen Banckert in charge of the van and Cornelis Tromp the rear. Although the Dutch ships were smaller on average than their opponents, their crews were better trained and more experienced.

==Battle==
In late July, Rupert put to sea again, hoping to draw the Dutch fleet north by feinting against The Hague or Den Helder. De Ruyter initially remained at Schooneveld, but William ordered him to escort an inbound Dutch East India Company treasure fleet, whose capture could provide Charles enough funds to continue the war.

De Ruyter first decided not to leave his defensive position in the Schooneveld, from which he had successfully engaged the allied fleet in the double Battle of Schooneveld. However the Dutch Spice Fleet was returning from the Indies, filled with precious cargo. With half the country under French occupation for almost a year, the Dutch Republic&#x27;s finances were in disastrous straits. The Dutch could not afford to lose the wealth the Spice Fleet was bringing, let alone allow it to be captured by the enemy. As such stadtholder William ordered De Ruyter to seek to engage the enemy.

Although outnumbered, De Ruyter gained the weather gauge and sent his van under Adriaen Banckert in to separate the Allied van (under D&#x27;Estrées) from the main fleet. His ploy was effective, and the French ships were unable to play a significant part in the remainder of the battle, which became a gruelling encounter between the bulk of the Dutch fleet and the English centre and rear divisions. Both suffered badly during hours of fierce fighting.

Once again, the rear divisions led by Spragge and Tromp clashed repeatedly, Spragge having publicly sworn to kill or capture his old enemy. Each had to shift their flags to fresh ships three times; on the third occasion, Spragge drowned when the boat transporting him sank. More importantly, his preoccupation with duelling Tromp isolated the English centre, and was a key factor in allowing an inferior but better managed fleet to succeed.

The fight between the English and Dutch centre under De Ruyter and Lieutenant-Admiral Aert Jansse van Nes continued for hours, with each side gaining the weather gauge as the winds shifted. Having disengaged from the French, Banckert joined the Dutch centre, followed first by Rupert, then De Ruyter; the main focus of the fight was a Dutch attempt to capture Spragge&#x27;s isolated flagship, the &quot;Prince&quot;. This was unsuccessful, and with both fleets exhausted, the Allies withdrew; although no major ships sunk, many were seriously damaged and about 3,000 men died, two-thirds of them English or French.

==Aftermath==

After the battle, Prince Rupert complained the French had not done their share of the fighting, and their performance is still disputed. While Prud&#x27;homme states the French fought hard, he accepts they allowed themselves to become separated from the English fleet. The main dispute is whether this was deliberate; D&#x27;Estrées had been ordered by Louis XIV to preserve the French fleet, and thus disobeyed Rupert&#x27;s orders to attack the Dutch, claiming the wind was too weak. By the admission of several French officers, their fleet was not prominent in the action, but they attributed this to inexperience.

The size of the Allied fleet and length of its battle line, combined with inadequacies in fighting instructions and signalling, made it hard to control. It deepened suspicions between the English and French, further undercutting popular support for the war, while ending any hopes of starving the Dutch through a naval blockade, making it an overwhelming strategic victory for the Dutch. This campaign was the highlight of De Ruyter&#x27;s career, as acknowledged by the Duke of York, who concluded &quot;he was the greatest that ever to that time was in the world&quot;.

Despite losing four ships, the Spice Fleet arrived safely, bringing the much needed financial reprieve. In the months following, the Netherlands formed a formal alliance with Spain and the Holy Roman Empire. The threat posed by German and Spanish invasions from the south and east forced the French to withdraw from the territory of the Republic. The Third Anglo-Dutch War came to an end with the signing of the Treaty of Westminster between the English and the Dutch in 1674. Fourteen years later the Glorious Revolution, which saw Stadtholder William III ascend the throne of England, put an end to the Anglo-Dutch conflicts of the 17th century. Not until 1781 would the Dutch and British fleets fight each other again in the battle of Dogger Bank.

<text>&quot;JAG&quot; (U.S. military acronym for Judge Advocate General) is an American legal drama television show with a distinct U.S. Navy and Marine Corps theme, created by Donald P. Bellisario, and produced by Belisarius Productions in association with Paramount Network Television (after 2006 known as CBS Studios). The first season was co-produced with NBC Productions.

Originally pitched towards the studio, network, and later also marketed for audiences as a &quot;Top Gun&quot; meets &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; hybrid series, the pilot episode of &quot;JAG&quot; first aired on NBC on September 23, 1995, but the series was later canceled on May 22, 1996, after finishing 79th in the ratings, leaving one episode unaired. Rival network CBS picked up the series for a mid-season replacement, beginning on January 3, 1997. For several seasons, &quot;JAG&quot; climbed in the ratings and was on the air for nine additional seasons. &quot;JAG&quot; furthermore spawned the hit series &quot;NCIS&quot;, which in turn spun off &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

In total, 227 episodes were produced over 10 seasons. At the time of the original airing of its fifth season in the United States, &quot;JAG&quot; was seen in over 90 countries worldwide. &quot;JAG&quot; entered syndication in early 1999.

== Ratings ==
== US television ratings ==
Seasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of &quot;JAG&quot; from Nielsen ratings on NBC (first season) and CBS (other seasons).
: Note: U.S. network television seasons generally start in late September and end in late May, which coincides with the completion of the May sweeps.

&quot;JAG&quot; had generally an older skewing audience: for the 2002-2003 season, the median age viewer was 58 (the same figure was also held by other CBS shows &quot;Becker&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot;). As a comparison, for the same season, &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; and &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; on NBC had a median of 50, while &quot;The Practice&quot; and &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; on ABC had a median of 48. However, as the article in &quot;Broadcasting &amp; Cable&quot; states: &quot;fewer broadcast network primetime series than [2013] had median age audiences over 50&quot;

==Home media==
&quot;JAG&quot; was not available on DVD (or VHS, with the singular exception of the pilot movie, which was given a VHS release by Paramount Home Video in 1998&lt;ref name=&quot;Jag / Premiere Episode VHS&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ) during the course of its original run. It was suggested that a syndication deal with USA Network possibly prevented Paramount from issuing DVD releases. Before it did happen in 2006, &quot;JAG&quot; was the second most requested TV series not commercially available on the TVShowsOnDVD.com website.

<text>Martin Buber (; , ; ; February 8, 1878 – June 13, 1965) was an Austrian-Israeli philosopher best known for his philosophy of dialogue, a form of existentialism centered on the distinction between the I–Thou relationship and the I–It relationship. Born in Vienna, Buber came from a family of observant Jews, but broke with Jewish custom to pursue secular studies in philosophy. He produced writings about Zionism and worked with various bodies within the Zionist movement extensively over a nearly 50-year period spanning his time in Europe and the Near East. In 1923, Buber wrote his famous essay on existence, &quot;Ich und Du&quot; (later translated into English as &quot;I and Thou&quot;), and in 1925 he began translating the Hebrew Bible into the German language.

He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature ten times, and the Nobel Peace Prize seven times.

== Biography ==
Martin (Hebrew name: &quot;מָרְדֳּכַי,&quot; &quot;Mordechai&quot;) Buber was born in Vienna to an Orthodox Jewish family. Buber was a direct descendant of the 16th-century rabbi Meir Katzenellenbogen, known as the Maharam (מהר&quot;ם), the Hebrew acronym for “Mordechai, HaRav (the Rabbi), Meir”, of Padua. Karl Marx is another notable relative. After the divorce of his parents when he was three years old, he was raised by his grandfather in Lemberg (now Lviv in Ukraine). His grandfather, Solomon Buber, was a scholar of Midrash and Rabbinic Literature. At home, Buber spoke Yiddish and German. In 1892, Buber returned to his father&#x27;s house in Lemberg.

Despite Buber&#x27;s putative connection to the Davidic line as a descendant of Katzenellenbogen, a personal religious crisis led him to break with Jewish religious customs. He began reading Immanuel Kant, Søren Kierkegaard, and Friedrich Nietzsche. The latter two, in particular, inspired him to pursue studies in philosophy. In 1896, Buber went to study in Vienna (philosophy, art history, German studies, philology).

In 1898, he joined the Zionist movement, participating in congresses and organizational work. In 1899, while studying in Zürich, Buber met his future wife, Paula Winkler, a &quot;brilliant Catholic writer from a Bavarian peasant family&quot; who in 1901 left the Catholic Church and in 1907 converted to Judaism.

Buber, initially, supported and celebrated the Great War as a &quot;world historical mission&quot; for Germany along with Jewish intellectuals to civilize the Near East. Some researchers believe that while in Vienna during and after World War I, he was influenced by the writings of Jacob L. Moreno, particularly the use of the term ‘encounter’.

In 1930, Buber became an honorary professor at the University of Frankfurt am Main, but resigned from his professorship in protest immediately after Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933. He then founded the Central Office for Jewish Adult Education, which became an increasingly important body as the German government forbade Jews from public education. In 1938, Buber left Germany and settled in Jerusalem, Mandatory Palestine, receiving a professorship at Hebrew University and lecturing in anthropology and introductory sociology. In 1947, he was forced to flee his home in Abu Tor, Jerusalem, due to the advance of the Arab Liberation Army. After the creation of the state of Israel in 1948, Buber became the best known Israeli philosopher. After 1948, Buber lived in Edward Said&#x27;s family home in Jerusalem.

Buber and Paula had two children: a son, Rafael Buber, and a daughter, Eva Strauss-Steinitz. They helped raise their granddaughters Barbara Goldschmidt (1921–2013) and Judith Buber Agassi (1924–2018), born by their son Rafael&#x27;s marriage to Margarete Buber-Neumann.
Buber&#x27;s wife Paula Winkler died in 1958 in Venice, and he died at his home in the Talbiya neighborhood of Jerusalem on June 13, 1965.
Buber was a vegetarian.

== Major themes ==

Buber&#x27;s evocative, sometimes poetic, writing style marked the major themes in his work: the retelling of Hasidic and Chinese tales, Biblical commentary, and metaphysical dialogue. A cultural Zionist, Buber was active in the Jewish and educational communities of Germany and Israel. He was also a staunch supporter of a binational solution in Palestine, and, after the establishment of the Jewish state of Israel, of a regional federation of Israel and Arab states. His influence extends across the humanities, particularly in the fields of social psychology, social philosophy, and religious existentialism.

Buber&#x27;s attitude toward Zionism was tied to his desire to promote a vision of &quot;Hebrew humanism&quot;. According to Laurence J. Silberstein, the terminology of &quot;Hebrew humanism&quot; was coined to &quot;distinguish [Buber&#x27;s] form of nationalism from that of the official Zionist movement&quot; and to point to how &quot;Israel&#x27;s problem was but a distinct form of the universal human problem. Accordingly, the task of Israel as a distinct nation was inexorably linked to the task of humanity in general&quot;.

== Zionist views ==

=== Pre-1915: Early engagement with Zionism ===

Approaching Zionism from his own personal viewpoint, a young Buber disagreed with Theodor Herzl about their respective positions on Zionism. Herzl did not envision Zionism as a movement with religious objectives. In contrast, Buber believed the potential of Zionism was for social and spiritual enrichment. For example, Buber argued that following the formation of the Israeli state, there would need to be reforms to Judaism: &quot;We need someone who would do for Judaism what Pope John XXIII has done for the Catholic Church&quot;. Herzl and Buber would continue, in mutual respect and disagreement, to work towards their respective goals for the rest of their lives. In 1902, Buber became the editor of the weekly &quot;Die Welt&quot;, the central organ of the Zionist movement. However, a year later he became involved with the Jewish Hasidic movement. Buber admired how the Hasidic communities actualized their religion in daily life and culture. In stark contrast to the busy Zionist organizations, which were always mulling political concerns, the Hasidim were focused on the values which Buber had long advocated for Zionism to adopt. In 1904, he withdrew from much of his Zionist organizational work, and devoted himself to study and writing, as in that same year, he published his thesis, &quot;Beiträge zur Geschichte des Individuationsproblems&quot;, on Jakob Böhme and Nikolaus Cusanus.

In a 1910 essay entitled &quot;He and We,&quot; Buber established himself and Herzl (who had died in 1904) as diametrically opposed in their perspectives on Zionism. Buber described Herzl by saying, &quot;The impulse of the elementally active person (Elementaraktiver) to act is so strong that it prevents him from acquiring knowledge for the sake of knowledge,&quot; and, according to Buber, when a person like Herzl is aware of his Jewishness, &quot;In him awakens the will to help the Jews to whom he belongs, to lead the where they can experience freedom and security. Now he does what his will tells He does not see anything else.&quot; In that same essay, Buber would draw a parallel between Herzl and Baal Shem Tov, the founder of Hasidism, arguing that both seek to reinstate the Jewish people, the difference coming in their approaches; Herzl affecting change indirectly via history whereas Baal Shem Tov sought to achieve improvement directly through religion.

=== 1915–38: Further development ===

Buber produced multiple writings on Zionism and nationalism during this period, expanding upon broader ideas related to Zionism. In light of the outbreak of WWI, Buber engaged in debates with fellow German philosopher Hermann Cohen in 1915 on the nature of nationalism and Zionism. Whereas Cohen, whose argument was based in messianic principles, believed that a Jewish minority was essential to a broader German national identity, Buber argued that, &quot;Judaism may well be taken up in messianic humanity, to be melted into it; we do not, however, consider that the Jewish people must disappear among contemporary humanity so that a messianic humanity might arise.&quot;

Buber continued to explore and develop his views on Zionism in these years. One such notable piece of writing is a letter to a professor entitled &quot;Concepts and Reality&quot; in 1916. In this letter, Buber addresses the issues of nationalism, Messianism, and Hebrew within the Zionist movement of the period. Buber argued that nationalism is not a natural phenomenon, and that Zionism is a movement centered around religiosity, not nationalism. However, according to Buber, the messianic movement within Zionism is obscured by those in liberal Jewish and anti-Zionist circles, who argue that Messianism necessitates a diaspora. On the importance of the Hebrew language, Buber believed, &quot;Hebrew is not first and foremost a vernacular but the single language that can fully absorb and express the sublime values of Judaism.&quot;

In the early 1920s, Martin Buber started advocating a binational Jewish-Arab state, stating that the Jewish people should proclaim &quot;its desire to live in peace and brotherhood with the Arab people, and to develop the common homeland into a republic in which both peoples will have the possibility of free development.&quot; 

Buber rejected the idea of Zionism as just another national movement, and wanted instead to see the creation of an exemplary society; a society which would not be characterized by Jewish domination of the Arabs. He was influenced by cultural Zionist Ahad Ha&#x27;am. Buber believed that it was necessary for the Zionist movement to reach a consensus with the Arabs even at the cost of the Jews remaining a minority in the country. In 1925, he, alongside his friend Judah Magnes, was involved in the creation of the organization Brit Shalom (Covenant of Peace), which advocated the creation of a binational state, and throughout the rest of his life, he hoped and believed that Jews and Arabs one day would live in peace in a joint nation.

In a 1929 essay entitled &quot;The National Home and National Policy in Palestine,&quot; Buber explores Jewish right to the land of Israel before engaging with the question of Jewish-Arab relations. According to Buber, the Zionist right to establish a country in Israel originates from their ancient, ancestral connection to the land, the fact that Jews have worked to cultivate the land in recent years, and the future prospect that a Jewish state offers as both a cultural center for Judaism and a model for creating a new social organization, referencing the emergence of kibbutzim. Buber goes on to discuss, broadly, the necessity for injustice in order to survive, and focuses it to the Zionist perspective by writing, &quot;It is indeed true that there can be no life without injustice. The fact that there is no living creature that can live and thrive without destroying another existing organism has a symbolic significance as regards our human life. But the human aspect of life begins the moment we say to ourselves: We will not do more injustice to others than we are forced to do to exist.&quot; Buber then uses this perspective to argue in favor of Binationalism as means to establish a combination of potential coexistence and national independence.

=== Post 1938: Zionist views from Israel and post-Independence Zionism ===

Living and writing in Jerusalem, Buber increased his political involvement, and continued to develop his ideas on Zionism. In 1942, he co‑founded the Ihud party, which advocated a bi-nationalist program. Nevertheless, he was connected with decades of friendship to Zionists and philosophers such as Chaim Weizmann, Max Brod, Hugo Bergmann, and Felix Weltsch, who were close friends of his from old European times in Prague, Berlin, and Vienna to the Jerusalem of the 1940s through the 1960s.

Buber evaluated the competing strains of cultural and political Zionism from a somewhat teleological perspective in a 1948 piece &quot;Zionism and Zionism&quot;. He summarizes these two competing perspectives as, on the one hand, &quot;returning and restoring the true Israel, whose spirit and life would once again no longer exist beside each other,&quot; and, on the other hand, as a process of &quot;normalization,&quot; and that to be &quot;normal,&quot; a &quot;nation needs a land, a language, and independence. Thus, one must only go and acquire those commodities, and the rest will take care of itself.&quot; According Buber, as Jews and Israel succeed at being a &quot;normal nation,&quot; the drive for a spiritual and cultural rebirth is lost, and the war being waged over political structure threatens to become a war for survival. After the establishment of Israel in 1948, Buber advocated Israel&#x27;s participation in a federation of &quot;Near East&quot; states wider than just Palestine. Buber outlines this concept in &quot;Zionism and Zionism&quot;. For Buber, Israel has the potential to serve as an example for the &quot;Near East&quot; as, in his Binationalist perspective, two independent nations, could each maintain their own cultural identity, &quot;but both united in the enterprise of developing their common homeland and in the federal management of shared matters. On the strength of that covenant we wish to return once more to the union of Near Eastern nations, to build an economy integrated in that of the Near East, to carry out policies in the framework of the life of the Near East, and, God willing, to send the &quot;living idea&quot; forth to the world from the Near East once again.&quot; During this same time period Buber remained critical of many policies and leaders of the new Israeli government. He was particularly vocal about the treatment of Arab refugees, and was unafraid to criticize top leadership like David Ben-Gurion, the first Prime Minister.

== Literary and academic career ==

From 1905 he worked for the publishing house Rütten &amp; Loening as a lecturer; there he initiated and supervised the completion of the social psychological monograph series &quot;&quot;.

From 1906 until 1914, Buber published editions of Hasidic, mystical, and mythic texts from Jewish and world sources. In 1916, he moved from Berlin to Heppenheim.

During World War I, he helped establish the Jewish National Committee to improve the condition of Eastern European Jews. During that period he became the editor of &quot;Der Jude&quot; (German for &quot;The Jew&quot;), a Jewish monthly (until 1924). In 1921, Buber began his close relationship with Franz Rosenzweig. In 1922, he and Rosenzweig co-operated in Rosenzweig&#x27;s House of Jewish Learning, known in Germany as &quot;Lehrhaus&quot;.

In 1923, Buber wrote his famous essay on existence, &quot;Ich und Du&quot; (later translated into English as &quot;I and Thou&quot;). Though he edited the work later in his life, he refused to make substantial changes. In 1925, he began, in conjunction with Franz Rosenzweig, translating the Hebrew Bible into German (&quot;Die Schrift&quot;). He himself called this translation &quot;Verdeutschung&quot; (&quot;Germanification&quot;), since it does not always use literary German language, but instead attempts to find new dynamic (often newly invented) equivalent phrasing to respect the multivalent Hebrew original. Between 1926 and 1930, Buber co-edited the quarterly &quot;Die Kreatur&quot; (&quot;The Creature&quot;).

In 1930, Buber became an honorary professor at the University of Frankfurt am Main. He resigned in protest from his professorship immediately after Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933. On October 4, 1933, the Nazi authorities forbade him to lecture. In 1935, he was expelled from the &quot;Reichsschrifttumskammer&quot; (the National Socialist authors&#x27; association). He then founded the Central Office for Jewish Adult Education, which became an increasingly important body, as the German government forbade Jews to attend public education. The Nazi administration increasingly obstructed this body.

Finally, in 1938, Buber left Germany, and settled in Jerusalem, then capital of Mandate Palestine. He received a professorship at Hebrew University, there lecturing in anthropology and introductory sociology. The lectures he gave during the first semester were published in the book &quot;The problem of man&quot; (&quot;Das Problem des Menschen&quot;); in these lectures he discusses how the question &quot;What is Man?&quot; became the central one in philosophical anthropology. He participated in the discussion of the Jews&#x27; problems in Palestine and of the Arab question – working out of his Biblical, philosophic, and Hasidic work.

He became a member of the group &quot;Ihud&quot;, which aimed at a bi-national state for Arabs and Jews in Palestine. Such a binational confederation was viewed by Buber as a more proper fulfillment of Zionism than a solely Jewish state. In 1949, he published his work &quot;Paths in Utopia&quot;, in which he detailed his communitarian socialist views and his theory of the &quot;dialogical community&quot; founded upon interpersonal &quot;dialogical relationships&quot;.

After World War II, Buber began lecture tours in Europe and the United States. In 1952, he argued with Jung over the existence of God.

== Philosophy ==

Buber is famous for his thesis of dialogical existence, as he described in the book &quot;I and Thou&quot;. However, his work dealt with a range of issues including religious consciousness, modernity, the concept of evil, ethics, education, and Biblical hermeneutics.

Buber rejected the label of &quot;philosopher&quot; or &quot;theologian&quot;, claiming he was not interested in ideas, only personal experience, and could not discuss God, but only relationships to God.

Politically, Buber&#x27;s social philosophy on points of prefiguration aligns with that of anarchism, though Buber explicitly disavowed the affiliation in his lifetime and justified the existence of a state under limited conditions.

=== Dialogue and existence ===
In &quot;I and Thou&quot;, Buber introduced his thesis on human existence. Inspired by Feuerbach&#x27;s &quot;The Essence of Christianity&quot; and Kierkegaard&#x27;s &quot;Single One&quot;, Buber worked upon the premise of existence as encounter. He explained this philosophy using the word pairs of &quot;Ich-Du&quot; and &quot;Ich-Es&quot; to categorize the modes of consciousness, interaction, and being through which an individual engages with other individuals, inanimate objects, and all reality in general. Theologically, he associated the first with the Jewish Jesus and the second with the apostle Paul (formerly Saul of Tarsus, a Jew). Philosophically, these word pairs express complex ideas about modes of being—particularly how a person exists and actualizes that existence. As Buber argues in &quot;I and Thou&quot;, a person is at all times engaged with the world in one of these modes.

The generic motif Buber employs to describe the dual modes of being is one of dialogue (&quot;Ich-Du&quot;) and monologue (&quot;Ich-Es&quot;). The concept of communication, particularly language-oriented communication, is used both in describing dialogue/monologue through metaphors and expressing the interpersonal nature of human existence.

==== &quot;Ich-Du&quot; ====
&quot;Ich‑Du&quot; (&quot;I‑Thou&quot; or &quot;I‑You&quot; – &#x27;you&#x27; in a very personal, connected sense. &#x27;Du&#x27; in German means &#x27;you&#x27;, but is generally only used to a closely-connected person, such as a close relative) is a relationship that stresses the mutual, holistic existence of two beings. It is a concrete encounter, because these beings meet one another in their authentic existence, without any qualification or objectification of one another. Even imagination and ideas do not play a role in this relation. In an I–Thou encounter, infinity and universality are made actual (rather than being merely concepts). Buber stressed that an &quot;Ich‑Du&quot; relationship lacks any composition (e. g., structure) and communicates no content (e. g., information). Despite the fact that &quot;Ich‑Du&quot; cannot be proven to happen as an event (e. g., it cannot be measured), Buber stressed that it is real and perceivable. A variety of examples are used to illustrate &quot;Ich‑Du&quot; relationships in daily life—two lovers, an observer and a cat, the author and a tree, and two strangers on a train. Common English words used to describe the &quot;Ich‑Du&quot; relationship include encounter, meeting, dialogue, mutuality, and exchange.

One key &quot;Ich‑Du&quot; relationship Buber identified was that which can exist between a human being and God. Buber argued that this is the only way in which it is possible to interact with God, and that an &quot;Ich‑Du&quot; relationship with anything or anyone connects in some way with the eternal relation to God.

To create this I–Thou relationship with God, a person has to be open to the idea of such a relationship, but not actively pursue it. The pursuit of such a relation creates qualities associated with It‑ness, and so would prevent an I‑You relation, limiting it to I‑It. Buber claims that if we are open to the I–Thou, God eventually comes to us in response to our welcome. Also, because the God Buber describes is completely devoid of qualities, this I–Thou relationship lasts as long as the individual wills it. When the individual finally returns to the I‑It way of relating, this acts as a barrier to deeper relationship and community.

==== &quot;Ich-Es&quot; ====
The &quot;Ich-Es&quot; (&quot;I‑It&quot;) relationship is nearly the opposite of &quot;Ich‑Du&quot;. Whereas in &quot;Ich‑Du&quot; the two beings encounter one another, in an &quot;Ich‑Es&quot; relationship the beings do not actually meet. Instead, the &quot;I&quot; confronts and qualifies an idea, or conceptualization, of the being in its presence and treats that being as an object. All such objects are considered merely mental representations, created and sustained by the individual mind. This is based partly on Kant&#x27;s theory of phenomenon, in that these objects reside in the cognitive agent&#x27;s mind, existing only as thoughts. Therefore, the &quot;Ich‑Es&quot; relationship is in fact a relationship with oneself; it is not a dialogue, but a monologue.

In the &quot;Ich-Es&quot; relationship, an individual treats other things, people, etc., as objects to be used and experienced. Essentially, this form of objectivity relates to the world in terms of the self – how an object can serve the individual&#x27;s interest.

Buber argued that human life consists of an oscillation between &quot;Ich‑Du&quot; and &quot;Ich‑Es&quot;, and that in fact &quot;Ich‑Du&quot; experiences are rather few and far between. In diagnosing the various perceived ills of modernity (e. g., isolation, dehumanization, etc.), Buber believed that the expansion of a purely analytic, material view of existence was at heart an advocation of &quot;Ich‑Es&quot; relations - even between human beings. Buber argued that this paradigm devalued not only existents, but the meaning of all existence.

== Students and colleagues ==
Buber was a sort of mentor figure in the lives of Gershom Scholem and Walter Benjamin, the &#x27;Kabbalist of the Holy City&#x27; and the &#x27;Marxist Rabbi&#x27; of Berlin during the era leading up to, overlapping with proceeding after the Holocaust (Benjamin died during his escape from Europe, but Buber retained contact with Scholem after the war).

While his relationship with these two was sometimes unilaterally contentious (with the students occasionally attacking or critiquing their patron somewhat viciously) Buber acted as an impresario, publisher and by various means as one of the great sponsors of their careers and growing reputations. Scholem was to be amongst the friends and interested parties who helped attend to and orchestrate Buber&#x27;s eventual emigration to Palestine from the very beginning stages of that discussion during the rise of Hitler. They corresponded also in regards to their work with Brit Shalom, an early think-tank that was tasked with figuring out the dynamics of two-state solution to be brokered between Israel and Palestine more than twenty years before Israel became a nation state—and also about a great many issues regarding their shared interest in ancient, sacred and often mystical Jewish literature whilst keeping tabs likewise on mutual acquaintances and important publications in their fields of interest. Scholem dedicated his bibliography of the Zohar to Buber.

== Hasidism and mysticism ==
Buber was a scholar, interpreter, and translator of Hasidic lore. He viewed Hasidism as a source of cultural renewal for Judaism, frequently citing examples from the Hasidic tradition that emphasized community, interpersonal life, and meaning in common activities (e. g., a worker&#x27;s relation to his tools). The Hasidic ideal, according to Buber, emphasized a life lived in the unconditional presence of God, where there was no distinct separation between daily habits and religious experience. This was a major influence on Buber&#x27;s philosophy of anthropology, which considered the basis of human existence as dialogical.

In 1906, Buber published &quot;Die Geschichten des Rabbi Nachman&quot;, a collection of the tales of the Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, a renowned Hasidic &quot;rebbe&quot;, as interpreted and retold in a Neo-Hasidic fashion by Buber. Two years later, Buber published &quot;Die Legende des Baalschem&quot; (stories of the Baal Shem Tov), the founder of Hasidism.

== Awards and recognition ==

<text>Brothers in Arms is the fifth studio album by the British rock band Dire Straits, released on 17 May 1985, by Vertigo Records internationally and Warner Bros. Records in the United States. It was the first album in history to sell over one million copies in CD format.

&quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; spent a total of 14 non-consecutive weeks at number one on the UK Albums Chart (including ten consecutive weeks between 18 January and 22 March 1986), nine weeks at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the United States and 34 weeks at number one on the Australian Albums Chart. It was the first album to be certified ten-times platinum in the UK and is the eighth-best-selling album in UK chart history. It is certified nine-times platinum in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and is one of the world&#x27;s best-selling albums, having sold more than 30 million copies worldwide.

The album won a Grammy Award in 1986 for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical and Best British Album at the 1987 Brit Awards; the 20th Anniversary reissue won another Grammy in 2006 for Best Surround Sound Album. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; at number 418 on its list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. &quot;Q&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; number 51 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest British Albums Ever&quot;.

==Recording==

&quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; was recorded from November 1984 to February 1985 at AIR Studios on the island of Montserrat, a British overseas territory in the Caribbean. The album was produced by songwriter Mark Knopfler and Neil Dorfsman, who had engineered Dire Straits&#x27; 1982 album &quot;Love over Gold&quot; and Knopfler&#x27;s 1983 soundtrack album &quot;Local Hero&quot;.

&quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; was one of the first albums recorded on a Sony 24-track digital tape machine. The decision to move to digital recording came from Knopfler&#x27;s constant striving for better sound quality. &quot;One of the things that I totally respected about him,&quot; Dorfsman observed, &quot;was his interest in technology as a means of improving his music. He was always willing to spend on high-quality equipment.&quot;

Before arriving at Montserrat, Knopfler had written all the songs and rehearsed them with the band. The studio lineup was Knopfler (vocals, guitar), John Illsley (bass), Hal Lindes (guitar), Alan Clark (keyboards), Terry Williams (drums) and new member Guy Fletcher (keyboards, backing vocals). Lindes left the band early on in the sessions, and was replaced in December 1984 by Jack Sonni, a New York-based guitarist and longstanding friend of Knopfler. (Sonni&#x27;s only contribution to the album was the guitar synthesizer on &quot;The Man&#x27;s Too Strong&quot;, with all the other guitar parts played by Knopfler).

The studio itself was small, with a recording space that offered virtually no isolation. &quot;It was a good-sounding studio,&quot; Dorfsman later recalled, &quot;but the main room itself was nothing to write home about. The sound of that studio was the desk,&quot; referring to the Neve 8078 board. Knopfler and Dorfsman utilised the limited space to best effect, placing the drum kit in the far left corner, facing the control room, miked with Sennheiser MD 421s on the toms, an Electro-Voice RE20 and AKG D12 on the kick drum, a Shure SM57 and AKG C451 with a 20 dB pad on the snare, 451s for overheads and the hi-hat, and Neumann U87s set back a little to capture &quot;some kind of ambience&quot;. They placed the piano in a tight booth in the far right corner of the studio, miked with AKG C414s. The Hammond B3 was placed nearby, with its Leslie speaker crammed into an airlock next to the control room. Illsley&#x27;s bass amplifier was recorded inside a small vocal booth with a Neumann FET 47 and a DI unit. Knopfler&#x27;s amplifiers were miked with 57s, 451s, and Neumann U67s. Fletcher&#x27;s synths were placed in the control room.

During the recording of &quot;Money for Nothing&quot;, the signature sound of Knopfler&#x27;s guitar may have been enhanced by a &quot;happy accident&quot; of microphone placement. Knopfler was using his Gibson Les Paul going through a Laney amplifier. While setting up the guitar amplifier microphones in an effort to get the &quot;ZZ Top sound&quot; that Knopfler sought, guitar tech Ron Eve, who was in the control room, heard the &quot;amazing&quot; sound before Dorfsman was finished arranging the mics. &quot;One mic was pointing down at the floor,&quot; Dorfsman remembered, &quot;another was not quite on the speaker, another was somewhere else, and it wasn&#x27;t how I would want to set things up—it was probably just left from the night before, when I&#x27;d been preparing things for the next day and had not really finished the setup.&quot; What they heard was exactly what ended up on the record; no additional processing or effects were used during the mix.

According to a &quot;Sound on Sound&quot; magazine interview with Neil Dorfsman, during the first month of the recording sessions at Montserrat the performance of Terry Williams was considered to be unsuitable for the desired sound of the album. According to Williams himself, he had recorded all his drum parts to a click track, which he felt hindered his ability to channel the rhythmic feel he wanted. About six weeks into the sessions, after listening to a playback of what had been recorded so far, he voiced his disappointment to Mark Knopfler over some of his own playing. Shortly after this, he was dismissed from the sessions.

Dorfsman and Knopfler made the decision to erase Williams&#x27; contributions. Williams was replaced in the sessions by jazz session drummer Omar Hakim, who re-recorded all the album&#x27;s drum parts during a two-day stay before leaving for other commitments. All of the drumming on the final album was performed by Hakim, with the exception of the song &quot;Walk of Life&quot; and the improvised crescendo at the beginning of &quot;Money for Nothing&quot;. (In another interview, Dorfsman has said that Williams&#x27; fills and tom-toms were also used in the rest of &quot;Money for Nothing&quot;). Both Hakim and Williams are credited on the album.

A defective batch of recording tape at AIR Studios resulted in the loss of part or all of three album tracks, leading to follow-up sessions being recorded at the Power Station in New York during early 1985 (including the addition of a Jack Sonni guitar synthesizer part to &quot;The Man&#x27;s Too Strong&quot;). During this time, overdubs were recorded with further New York musicians including Michael and Randy Brecker, Mike Mainieri (who had previously contributed vibraphone to &quot;Love Over Gold&quot;) and percussionist Jimmy Maelen, plus trumpeter Dave Plews and Average White Band saxophonist Malcolm Duncan.

When Illsley broke both elbows after a fall whilst jogging in Central Park, several prominent New York studio bassists were hired to record or re-record several basslines on the record. Tony Levin contributed to &quot;Why Worry&quot;. &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; house band bassist Neil Jason was brought in for a week&#x27;s work which included takes on &quot;So Far Away&quot;, &quot;Walk of Life&quot;, &quot;Ride Across the River&quot;, &quot;Your Latest Trick&quot; and &quot;The Man&#x27;s Too Strong&quot;, although the only fully confirmed released results from the Jason sessions were the slap-style funk bassline on &quot;One World&quot; and &quot;slides on my fretless—almost like a Syndrum effect&quot; on the intro to the extended version of &quot;Money for Nothing&quot;.

Although Andy Kanavan was briefly recruited as Dire Straits&#x27; new drummer, Terry Williams ended up rejoining the band for the promotional concert world tour, which lasted until April 1986. All the music videos that were released from the album featured Williams.

==Composition==
&quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; has been described musically as a pop rock album. The music video for &quot;Money for Nothing&quot; received heavy rotation on MTV, and it was the first to be aired on MTV Europe when the network launched on 1 August 1987. It is one of only two Dire Straits songs on a studio album not to be solely credited to Knopfler (the other being &quot;The Carousel Waltz&quot;, which opens &quot;Making Movies&quot;), with guest vocalist Sting given a co-writing credit due to the melody of the repeated &quot;I want my MTV&quot; (sung by Sting) at the start echoing the melody of the Police&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Stand So Close to Me&quot;.

&quot;Walk of Life&quot; was a number two hit in the UK Singles Chart in early 1986 and a number seven hit in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 later that year. The song was nearly left off the album, but was included after the band out-voted producer Neil Dorfsman.

On the second side of the album, three songs (&quot;Ride Across the River&quot;, &quot;The Man&#x27;s Too Strong&quot; and &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot;) are lyrically focused on militarism. &quot;Ride Across the River&quot; uses immersive Latin American imagery, accompanied by synthesized pan flute, mariachi trumpet, a reggae-influenced drum part and eerie background noises. &quot;The Man&#x27;s Too Strong&quot; depicts the character of an ancient soldier (or war criminal) and his fear of showing feelings as a weakness. Written during the 1982 Falklands War, &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; deals with the senselessness of war.

In 2007, the 25th anniversary of the war, Knopfler recorded a new version of the song at Abbey Road Studios to raise funds for British veterans who he said &quot;are still suffering from the effects of that conflict&quot;.

==Artwork==
The guitar featured on the front of the album cover is Mark Knopfler&#x27;s 1937 14-fret National Style &quot;O&quot; Resonator. The Style &quot;O&quot; line of guitars was introduced in 1930 and discontinued in 1941. The photographer was Deborah Feingold. The back cover features a painting of the same guitar, by German artist Thomas Steyer. A similar image was also used, with a similar colour scheme, for the 1989 album &quot;The Booze Brothers&quot; by Brewers Droop, which features Knopfler on a few tracks.

==Release==
&quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; was one of the first albums directed at the CD market, and it was a full digital recording (DDD) at a time when most popular music was recorded on analog equipment. It was also released on vinyl (abridged to fit on one LP) and cassette. Producer Neil Dorfsman says the digital multitrack was mixed on a Solid State Logic analog board, with the resulting two track mix re-digitized via a Prism A/D converter and recorded on a DAT machine.

&quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; was the first album to sell one million copies in the CD format and to outsell its LP version. Rykodisc co-founder Rob Simonds subsequently wrote, &quot;[In 1985] we were fighting to get our CDs manufactured because the entire worldwide manufacturing capacity was overwhelmed by demand for a single rock title (Dire Straits&#x27; &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot;).&quot;

It was remastered and reissued with the rest of the Dire Straits catalogue in 1996 for most of the world outside the United States and on 19 September 2000 in the United States, the remastering for both reissues was done by Bob Ludwig at Gateway Mastering using the Super Bit Mapping process. In 2000, it was released on XRCD2 format, remastered by Hiromichi Takiguchi using K2 20bit technology. A 20th anniversary edition was issued on Super Audio CD on 26 July 2005 (becoming the 3000th title for the SACD format), featuring a 5.1 surround sound remix done by Chuck Ainlay at British Grove Studios. It was mastered by Bob Ludwig at Gateway Mastering. The 5.1 mix was also released on DualDisc format with DVD-Audio 24 bit/96 kHz track on 16 August 2005. Ainlay&#x27;s 5.1 remix won a Grammy for Best Surround Sound Album at the 48th Grammy Awards ceremony. In 2006, a half-speed–mastered vinyl version of the album was issued. Mastered by Stan Ricker, this version consists of four sides on two 33 1/3 rpm discs, containing the full-length songs on vinyl for the first time. In 2013, Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab released a hybrid SACD mastered from the original tapes by Shawn R. Britton. It includes the original stereo mix only. In 2014, a new master was released in Japan on SHM-SACD – it is made from the original analogue master tapes and contains the original LP length of the album: 47:44. This edition was transferred by Mick McKenna and Richard Whittaker at FX Copyroom using Direct Stream Digital. On 19 May 2014, Vertigo reissued the album on double 180g vinyl; this edition contains the full-length songs. It was mastered by Bob Ludwig, Bernie Grundman and Chris Bellman from the original analogue and digital tapes, and was also included on &quot;The Studio Albums 1978–1991&quot; the previous year. In 2015, Mobile Fidelity also released the album on double 45 RPM vinyl, which was mastered by Krieg Wunderlich. The same year, the album re-entered the UK Albums Chart at number 8 following the record being made available at a discounted price on digital music retailers. In March 2021, a new half-speed mastered edition was released, mastered at Abbey Road Studios by Miles Showell. The release was a double-LP, 45 rpm, 180 gram edition, with the complete version of the album, for only the second time (the first being issued by Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab in 2015). The album has spent a total of 356 weeks on the UK Albums Chart.

==Critical reception==
Initial reviews of &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; from the UK music press in 1985 were generally negative. In a scathing review for &quot;NME&quot;, Mat Snow criticised Knopfler&#x27;s &quot;mawkish self-pity, his lugubriously mannered appropriation of rockin&#x27; Americana, his thumpingly crass attempts at wit&quot;. He also accused the album of the &quot;tritest would-be melodies in history, the last word in tranquilising chord changes, the most cloying lonesome playing and ultimate in transparently fake troubador sentiment ever to ooze out of a million-dollar recording studio&quot;. Eleanor Levy of &quot;Record Mirror&quot; dismissed the &quot;West Coast guitars reeking of mega bucks and sell out stadium concerts throughout the globe. Laid back melodies. Dire Straits – summed up... This is like any other Dire Straits album quarried out of the tottering edifice of MOR rock.&quot;

The reviews from other UK music papers were less harsh, with Jack Barron of &quot;Sounds&quot; feeling that &quot;it&#x27;s only a halfway decent album because it has only halfway decent songs... Knopfler has distilled his sonic essence, via blues, to appeal to billboard romantics with cinemascope insecurities. And he &quot;can&quot; pull it off well... but not often enough here.&quot; &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s Barry McIlheney observed that Knopfler had recently explored different creative directions with his work on movie soundtracks and on Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Infidels&quot;, and bemoaned that &quot;this admirable spirit of adventure fails to materialise... Instead it sounds just a bit too like the last Dire Straits album, which sounded not unlike the last one before that, which sounded suspiciously like the beginning of a hugely successful and very lucrative plan to take over the world known as AOR&quot;. He concluded, &quot;the old rockschool restraints and the undeniably attractive smell of the winning formula seem to block out any such experimental work and what you end up with is something very like the same old story&quot;.

US reviews were more positive. Writing for &quot;Spin&quot; magazine, E. Brooks praised Knopfler&#x27;s guitar work and noted that &quot;when the intensity of his words approaches that of his ravishing stratocaster licks, the song soars. That doesn&#x27;t happen as often as I&#x27;d like on this new album [...] but I find myself returning to certain cuts the way one might come back to a favorite chair.&quot; Brooks singled out the &quot;haunting ballad&quot; &quot;Your Latest Trick&quot;, the &quot;acerbic satire of vid-rock culture&quot; in &quot;Money for Nothing&quot; and the &quot;outstanding craftsmanship in the words and music&quot; of the title track, which was &quot;not a new message, but at least something other than sex, cars, or drugs is being talked about here. Take that and the quality of the musicianship, and you&#x27;ve got a lot.&quot; Debby Bull gave the album a mixed review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, praising the &quot;carefully crafted&quot; effort, writing, &quot;The record is beautifully produced, with Mark Knopfler&#x27;s terrific guitar work catching the best light&quot;. Although she found the lyrics literate, Bull noted that the scenarios &quot;aren&#x27;t as interesting as they used to be on records like &quot;Making Movies&quot;&quot;. Despite the production values and notable contributions from guest artists like drummer Omar Hakim and the Brecker Brothers, Bull concluded that &quot;the music lacks the ache that made Knopfler&#x27;s recent soundtracks for &quot;Comfort and Joy&quot; and &quot;Cal&quot; so powerful.&quot; In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s end-of-year round-up of 1985&#x27;s key albums, Fred Schruers said that &quot;Knopfler&#x27;s nimble, evocative guitar style and gentle vocalizing are still as appealing as they were on previous scenario-rich albums&quot;.

Later reviews have praised the record. Reviewing the remastered Dire Straits albums in 1996, Rob Beattie of &quot;Q&quot; awarded &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; five stars out of five and wrote that &quot;repeated listening reveals it as a singularly melancholic collection – see the guitar slashing of &#x27;The Man&#x27;s Too Strong&#x27; and the title track, where joy is as sharp as sorrow&quot;. In a 2007 review for BBC Music, Chris Jones called &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; &quot;a phenomenon on every level... a suite of Knopfler&#x27;s very fine brand of JJ Cale-lite&quot;. In his retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album four out of five stars, crediting the international success of the album not only to the clever computer-animated video for &quot;Money for Nothing&quot;, but also to Knopfler&#x27;s &quot;increased sense of pop songcraft&quot;. According to Erlewine, Dire Straits had &quot;never been so concise or pop-oriented, and it wore well on them&quot;. Erlewine concluded that the album remains &quot;one of their most focused and accomplished albums, and in its succinct pop sense, it&#x27;s distinctive within their catalog&quot;.

In 2010, when &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; was among ten albums nominated for the best British album of the past 30 years by the Brit Awards, music broadcaster and author Paul Gambaccini described the list of nominees as &quot;risible&quot; but added, &quot;&quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; runs away with it for the quality of songwriting and musicianship.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; won Best British Album at the 1987 Brit Awards (in a first-time occurrence, it had actually been nominated for Best Album a year earlier at the 1986 Brit Awards but lost out to Phil Collins&#x27; &quot;No Jacket Required&quot;, before being nominated again the following year due to its chart longevity).
Also in 1986, the album won a Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical, while the &quot;20th Anniversary Edition&quot; won another Grammy in 2006 for Best Surround Sound Album.

In 2000, &quot;Q&quot; magazine placed the album at number 51 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. In 2003, the album ranked number 351 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, and number 352 in a 2012 revised list, and number 418 in the 2020 revision. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

In November 2006 the results of a national poll conducted by the public of Australia revealed their top 100 favourite albums. &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; came in at number 64 (see &quot;My Favourite Album&quot;). &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; is ranked number three in the best albums of 1985 and number 31 in the best albums of the 1980s.

As of July 2016 &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; is the eighth-best-selling album of all-time in the UK. In the Netherlands, the album held the record for longest run ever on the Dutch Album chart with 269 weeks (non-consecutive) but was surpassed by Adele&#x27;s album &quot;21&quot; in 2016.

<text>Making Movies is the third studio album by British rock band Dire Straits, released on 17 October 1980 by Vertigo Records internationally, Warner Bros. Records in the United States and Mercury Records in Canada. The album includes the single &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, which reached number 8 on the UK Singles Chart, as well as &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot;, featured in the 1982 Richard Gere film &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot;.

&quot;Making Movies&quot; reached number one on the album charts in Italy and Norway, number 19 in the United States and number 4 in the United Kingdom. &quot;Making Movies&quot; was later certified platinum in the United States and double-platinum in the United Kingdom by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) respectively.

==Background==
After Dire Straits&#x27; Communiqué Tour ended on 21 December 1979 in London, Mark Knopfler spent the first half of 1980 writing the songs for the band&#x27;s next album. He contacted Jimmy Iovine after hearing Iovine&#x27;s production on the song &quot;Because the Night&quot; by Patti Smith, a song written by Smith and Bruce Springsteen. Iovine had also worked on Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Born to Run&quot; and &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot; albums, and was instrumental in recruiting E-Street Band keyboardist Roy Bittan for the &quot;Making Movies&quot; sessions.

&quot;Making Movies&quot; was recorded at the Power Station in New York from 20 June to 25 August 1980. Jimmy Iovine and Mark Knopfler produced the album.

David Knopfler left Dire Straits in August 1980 during the recording of the album, following heated arguments with his brother and almost immediately after the recording of a BBC2 &quot;Arena&quot; documentary about the group featuring several individual interviews with the band members. His guitar tracks were almost complete for the album, but were re-recorded by Mark. David appears on video playing &quot;Solid Rock&quot; and &quot;Les Boys&quot; live in concert, but these performances preceded the recording. The album sessions continued with Sid McGinnis on rhythm guitar, although he was uncredited. Dire Straits expanded into a quintet when keyboard player Alan Clark and Californian guitarist Hal Lindes were recruited as full-time group members shortly after the album&#x27;s release in October 1980.

Four songs were recorded during the sessions but not released on the album: &quot;Making Movies&quot;, &quot;Suicide Towers&quot;, &quot;Twisting by the Pool&quot; and &quot;Sucker for Punishment&quot;. &quot;Twisting by the Pool&quot; was released on the &quot;ExtendedancEPlay&quot; EP on 10 January 1983 and reached the UK Top 20 when released as a single. The title of the album is taken from a line in the song &quot;Skateaway&quot; and from the outtake &quot;Making Movies&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Making Movies&quot; was released on 17 October 1980 on LP and cassette formats. In 1981, an identically named short film was released on VHS and Beta, as well as screened in some theatrical venues, consisting of three music videos directed by fashion/commercial photographer Lester Bookbinder, for &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; and &quot;Skateaway&quot;. The original CD version was released in 1984.

The album was remastered and reissued on CD with the rest of the Dire Straits catalogue in 1996 internationally and on 19 September 2000 in the United States.

The album&#x27;s primary single was &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; which reached number 8 in the UK singles chart in early 1981. The second single release was &quot;Skateaway&quot;, and the third and final single from the album was the lengthy opening track, &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot;, with its intro &quot;The Carousel Waltz&quot; by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II, which only reached the number 54 position in the UK.

With new group members Alan Clark and Hal Lindes on board, Dire Straits embarked on tours of Europe, North America, and Oceania from October 1980 until July 1981 to promote the album.

Three of the seven tracks from &quot;Making Movies&quot; continued to be played throughout the Love over Gold, Brothers in Arms and On Every Street tours: &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot;, and &quot;Solid Rock&quot;, while &quot;Expresso Love&quot; was played in all concert tours until 1986.

==Critical reception==
In his review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, David Fricke wrote, &quot;&quot;Making Movies&quot; is the record on which Mark Knopfler comes out from behind his influences and Dire Straits come out from behind Mark Knopfler. The combination of the star&#x27;s lyrical script, his intense vocal performances and the band&#x27;s cutting-edge rock &amp; roll soundtrack is breathtaking—everything the first two albums should have been but weren&#x27;t. If &quot;Making Movies&quot; really were a film, it might win a flock of Academy Awards.&quot;

In his retrospective review for &quot;AllMusic&quot;, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that &quot;Making Movies&quot; saw Dire Straits chief songwriter Mark Knopfler increasing his ambitions by moving on from roots rock to country rock and folk rock, and that his songwriting skills were keeping pace. He was also complimentary towards the album&#x27;s production and jazz leanings, though he opined that it runs out of steam towards the end.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Making Movies&quot; number 52 in their survey of the 100 Best Albums of the Eighties.

<text>On Every Street is the sixth and final studio album by British rock band Dire Straits, released on 9 September 1991 by Vertigo Records internationally, and by Warner Bros. Records in the United States. The follow-up to the band&#x27;s massively successful album &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot;, &quot;On Every Street&quot; reached the top of the UK Albums Chart and was also certified platinum by the RIAA.

==History==
&quot;On Every Street&quot; was released more than six years after the band&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot;. &quot;On Every Street&quot; reached number 12 in the United States and number one in the United Kingdom and numerous European countries. The album was produced by Mark Knopfler and Dire Straits.

By this time, the band comprised Knopfler, John Illsley, Alan Clark and Guy Fletcher, and the album features session musicians including Chris White, Paul Franklin, Phil Palmer, Danny Cummings and American drummer Jeff Porcaro from Toto, who was asked to play the band&#x27;s subsequent world tour, although he declined because of other commitments, both with Toto and as a studio musician.

Dire Straits promoted the album with a 14-month world tour which comprised 216 shows in Europe, North America, and Australia, sold 7.1 million tickets, and lasted from August 1991 to October 1992. This was documented in the group&#x27;s second live album, &quot;On the Night&quot;, which was recorded in May 1992 at Les Arenes in Nîmes, France, and at Feijenoord Stadion in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, and was released in May 1993.

Dire Straits disbanded permanently in 1995, after which Mark Knopfler pursued a solo career.

The album was remastered and reissued with the rest of the Dire Straits catalogue in 1996 for most of the world, except for the United States, where it was reissued on 19 September 2000.

<doc id="228995" wikidata="Q1213577" url="?curid=228995" title="Hyperion Cantos">
<text>The Hyperion Cantos is a series of science fiction novels by Dan Simmons. The title was originally used for the collection of the first pair of books in the series, &quot;Hyperion&quot; and &quot;The Fall of Hyperion&quot;, and later came to refer to the overall storyline, including &quot;Endymion&quot;, &quot;The Rise of Endymion&quot;, and a number of short stories. More narrowly, inside the fictional storyline, after the first volume, the Hyperion Cantos is an epic poem written by the character Martin Silenus covering in verse form the events of the first two books.

Of the four novels, &quot;Hyperion&quot; received the Hugo and Locus Awards in 1990; &quot;The Fall of Hyperion&quot; won the Locus and British Science Fiction Association Awards in 1991; and &quot;The Rise of Endymion&quot; received the Locus Award in 1998. All four novels were also nominated for various science fiction awards.

==Works==

===&quot;Hyperion&quot; (1989)===

First published in 1989, &quot;Hyperion&quot; has the structure of a frame story, similar to Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; and Giovanni Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Decameron&quot;. The story weaves the interlocking tales of a diverse group of travelers sent on a pilgrimage to the Time Tombs on Hyperion. The travelers have been sent by the Hegemony (the government of the human star systems), the All Thing, and the Church of the Final Atonement, alternately known as the Shrike Church, to make a request of the Shrike. As they progress in their journey, each of the pilgrims tells their tale.

===&quot;The Fall of Hyperion&quot; (1990)===

This book concludes the story begun in &quot;Hyperion&quot;. It abandons the storytelling frame structure of the first novel, and is instead presented primarily as a series of dreams by John Keats.

===&quot;Endymion&quot; (1996)===

The story commences 274 years after the events in the previous novel. Few main characters from the first two books are present in the later two. The main character is Raul Endymion, an ex-soldier who receives a death sentence after an unfair trial. He is rescued by Martin Silenus and asked to perform a series of rather extraordinarily difficult tasks. The main task is to rescue and protect the daughter of Brawne Lamia (one of the main characters of Hyperion), Aenea, a messiah coming from the time period just after the first books via time travel. The Catholic Church has become a dominant force in the human universe and views Aenea as a potential threat to their power. The group of Aenea, Endymion, and A. Bettik (an android) evades the Church&#x27;s forces on several worlds through use of the Consul&#x27;s spaceship, ending the story on Earth.

===&quot;The Rise of Endymion&quot; (1997)===

This final novel in the series finishes the story begun in &quot;Endymion&quot;, expanding on the themes in &quot;Endymion&quot;, as Raul and Aenea battle the Church and meet their respective destinies.

===Short stories===
The series also includes three short stories:
* &quot;Remembering Siri&quot; (1983, included almost verbatim in &quot;Hyperion&quot;)
* &quot;The Death of the Centaur&quot; (1990)
* &quot;Orphans of the Helix&quot; (1999)

==Development==
The Hyperion universe originated when Simmons was an elementary school teacher, as an extended tale he told at intervals to his young students; this is recorded in &quot;The Death of the Centaur&quot;, and its introduction. It then inspired his short story &quot;Remembering Siri&quot;, which eventually became the nucleus around which &quot;Hyperion&quot; and &quot;The Fall of Hyperion&quot; formed. After the quartet was published came the short story &quot;Orphans of the Helix&quot;. &quot;Orphans&quot; is currently the final work in the Cantos, both chronologically and internally.

The original &quot;Hyperion Cantos&quot; has been described as a novel published in two volumes, published separately at first for reasons of length. In his introduction to &quot;Orphans of the Helix&quot;, Simmons elaborates:

Some readers may know that I&#x27;ve written four novels set in the &quot;Hyperion Universe&quot;—&quot;Hyperion&quot;, &quot;The Fall of Hyperion&quot;, &quot;Endymion&quot;, and &quot;The Rise of Endymion&quot;. A perceptive subset of those readers—perhaps the majority—know that this so-called epic actually consists of two long and mutually dependent tales, the two Hyperion stories combined and the two Endymion stories combined, broken into four books because of the realities of publishing.

==Influences==
Much of the appeal of the series stems from its extensive use of references and allusions from a wide array of thinkers such as Teilhard de Chardin, John Muir, Norbert Wiener, and to the poetry of John Keats, the famous 19th-century English Romantic poet, Norse mythology, and the monk Ummon. A large number of technological elements are acknowledged by Simmons to be inspired by elements of &quot;Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World&quot;.

The Hyperion series has many echoes of Jack Vance, explicitly acknowledged in one of the later books.

The title of the first novel, &quot;Hyperion&quot;, is taken from one of Keats&#x27;s poems, the unfinished epic &quot;Hyperion&quot;. Similarly, the title of the third novel is from Keats&#x27; poem &quot;Endymion&quot;. Quotes from actual Keats poems and the fictional &quot;Cantos&quot; of Martin Silenus are interspersed throughout the novels. Simmons goes so far as to have two artificial reincarnations of John Keats (&quot;&quot;cybrid&quot;s&quot;: artificial intelligences in human bodies) play a major role in the series.

==Setting==
Much of the action in the series takes place on the planet Hyperion. It is described as having one-fifth less gravity than Earth standard. Hyperion has a number of peculiar indigenous flora and fauna, notably Tesla trees, which are essentially large electricity-spewing trees. It is also a &quot;labyrinthine&quot; planet, which means that it is home to ancient subterranean labyrinths of unknown purpose. Most importantly, Hyperion is the location of the Time Tombs, large artifacts surrounded by &quot;anti-entropic&quot; fields that allow them to move backward through time. 

In the fictional universe of the &quot;Hyperion Cantos&quot;, the Hegemony of Man encompasses over 200 planets. Faster than light communications technology, Fatlines, are said to operate through tachyon bursts. However, in later books it is revealed that they operate through the Void Which Binds. The Farcaster network was given to humanity by the TechnoCore and again it was another use of the Void Which Binds that allowed this instantaneous travel between worlds. The Hawking Drive was developed by the Human scientists, allowing the faster than light travel which led to the Hegira (from the Arabic word &quot;&quot;, meaning &#x27;migration&#x27;). The Gideon drive, a Core-provided starship drive, allows for near-instantaneous travel between any two points in human-occupied space. The drive&#x27;s use kills any human on board a Gideon-propelled starship; thus, the technology is only of use with remote probes or when used in conjunction with the Pax&#x27;s resurrection technology. The resurrection creche can regenerate someone carrying a cruciform from their remains. Treeships are living trees that are propelled by ergs (spider-like solid-state alien being that emits force fields) through space.

===The Shrike===

The region of the Tombs is also the home of the Shrike, a menacing half-mechanical, half-organic four-armed creature that features prominently in the series. It appears in all four Hyperion Cantos books and is an enigma in the initial two; its purpose is not revealed until the second book, but is still left nebulous. The Shrike appears to act both autonomously and as a servant of some unknown force or entity. In the first two Hyperion books, it exists solely in the area around the Time Tombs on the planet Hyperion. Its portrayal is changed significantly in the last two books, &quot;Endymion&quot; and &quot;The Rise of Endymion&quot;. In these novels, the Shrike appears effectively unfettered and protects the heroine Aenea against assassins of the opposing TechnoCore.

Surrounded in mystery, the object of fear, hatred, and even worship by members of the Church of the Final Atonement (the Shrike Cult), the Shrike&#x27;s origins are described as uncertain. It is portrayed as composed of razorwire, thorns, blades, and cutting edges, having fingers like scalpels and long, curved toe blades. It has the ability to control the flow of time, and may thus appear to travel infinitely fast. The Shrike may kill victims in a flash or it may transport them to an eternity of impalement upon an enormous artificial &#x27;Tree of Thorns,&#x27; or &#x27;Tree of Pain&#x27; in Hyperion&#x27;s distant future. The Tree of Thorns is described as an unimaginably large, metallic tree, alive with the agonized writhing of countless human victims of all ages and races. It is also hinted in the second book that the Tree of Thorns is actually a simulation generated by a mystical interface which connects to human brains via a strong and pulsing (as if it were alive) cord. The name Shrike seems a reference to the Loggerhead Shrike, a small fierce bird that impales its victims on thorns, spines, or twigs.

===Worlds and Systems===
In the fictional universe of the &quot;Hyperion Cantos&quot;, the Hegemony of Man encompasses over 200 planets. The following planets appear or are specifically mentioned in the &quot;Hyperion Cantos&quot;.

<text>Christopher Eric Hitchens (13 April 1949 – 15 December 2011) was a British and American author and journalist. He was the author of 18 books on faith, religion, culture, politics, and literature. He was born and educated in Britain, graduating in the 1970s from Oxford with a degree in philosophy, politics, and economics. In the early 1980s, he emigrated to the United States and wrote for &quot;The Nation&quot; and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. Known as one of the &quot;Four Horsemen&quot; of New Atheism (along with Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, and Daniel Dennett), he gained prominence as a columnist and speaker. His epistemological razor, which states that &quot;what can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence&quot;, is still of mark in philosophy and law.

Hitchens&#x27;s political views evolved greatly throughout his life. Originally describing himself as a democratic socialist, he was a member of various socialist organisations in his early life, including the Trotskyist International Socialists.

Hitchens was critical of aspects of American foreign policy, including its involvement in Vietnam, Chile, and East Timor. However, he also supported the United States in the Kosovo War. Hitchens emphasised the centrality of the American Revolution and Constitution to his political philosophy. He held complex views on abortion: being ethically opposed to it in most instances, and believing that a foetus was entitled to personhood; while holding ambiguous, changing views on its legality. He supported gun rights and supported same-sex marriage, while opposing the war on drugs. Beginning in the 1990s, and particularly after 9/11, his politics were widely viewed as drifting to the right, but Hitchens objected to being called &#x27;conservative&#x27;. During the 2000s, he argued for the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, endorsed the re-election campaign of US President George W. Bush in 2004, and viewed Islamism as the principal threat to the Western world.

Hitchens described himself as an antitheist and saw all religions as false, harmful, and authoritarian. He endorsed free expression, scientific scepticism, and separation of church and state, arguing science and philosophy are superior to religion as an ethical code of conduct for human civilisation. Hitchens notably wrote critical biographies of Catholic nun Mother Teresa in &quot;The Missionary Position&quot;, Bill Clinton in &quot;No One Left to Lie To&quot;, and American diplomat Henry Kissinger in &quot;The Trial of Henry Kissinger&quot;. Hitchens died from complications related to oesophageal cancer in December 2011, at the age of 62.

==Early life and education==
Hitchens was born in Portsmouth, Hampshire, the elder of two boys; his brother, Peter, became a socially conservative journalist. Their parents, Commander Eric Ernest Hitchens (1909–1987) and Yvonne Jean Hitchens (née Hickman; 1921–1973), met in Scotland when serving in the Royal Navy during World War II. His mother had been a Wren, a member of the Women&#x27;s Royal Naval Service. She was of Jewish origin, something that Hitchens discovered when he was 38; he thus came to identify as a Jew.

Hitchens often referred to his father simply as &#x27;the Commander&#x27;. Eric Hitchens was deployed on , which took part in the sinking of the in the Battle of the North Cape on 26 December 1943. He paid tribute to his father&#x27;s contribution to the war: &quot;Sending a Nazi convoy-raider to the bottom is a better day&#x27;s work than any I have ever done.&quot; Eric&#x27;s naval career required the family to move from base to base throughout Britain and its colonies; including to Malta, where Peter Hitchens was born in Sliema in 1951. Eric later worked as a book-keeper for boatbuilders, speedboat-manufacturers, and a prep school.

Hitchens attended two private schools—Mount House School, Tavistock, Devon, from the age of eight, and the Leys School in Cambridge. Hitchens went up to Balliol College, Oxford, in 1967 where he read philosophy, politics and economics and was tutored by Steven Lukes and Anthony Kenny. He graduated in 1970 with a third-class degree. In his adolescence, he was &quot;bowled over&quot; by Richard Llewellyn&#x27;s &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot;, Arthur Koestler&#x27;s &quot;Darkness at Noon,&quot; Fyodor Dostoyevsky&#x27;s &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;, R. H. Tawney&#x27;s critique on &quot;Religion and the Rise of Capitalism&quot;, and the works of George Orwell. In 1968, he took part in the TV quiz-show &quot;University Challenge&quot;.

In the 1960s, Hitchens joined the political left; drawn by disagreement over the Vietnam War, nuclear weapons, racism, and oligarchy, including that of &quot;the unaccountable corporation&quot;. He expressed affinity with the politically charged counter-cultural and protest movements of the 1960s and 1970s. He avoided the recreational drug-use of the time, saying &quot;in my cohort we were slightly anti-hedonistic ... it made it very much easier for police provocation to occur, because the planting of drugs was something that happened to almost everyone one knew.&quot; Hitchens was inspired to become a journalist after reading a piece by James Cameron.

Hitchens was bisexual during his younger days; and joked that as he aged, his appearance &quot;declined to the point where only women would go to bed with [him]&quot;. He said he had sexual relations with two male students at Oxford who would later become Tory ministers during the premiership of Margaret Thatcher, although he would not reveal their names publicly.

Hitchens joined the Labour Party in 1965, but along with the majority of the Labour students&#x27; organisation was expelled in 1967, because of what Hitchens called &quot;Prime Minister Harold Wilson&#x27;s contemptible support for the war in Vietnam&quot;. Under the influence of Peter Sedgwick, who translated the writings of Russian revolutionary and Soviet dissident Victor Serge, Hitchens forged an ideological interest in Trotskyism and anti-Stalinist socialism. Shortly after, he joined &quot;a small but growing post-Trotskyist Luxemburgist sect&quot;, the International Socialists. Hitchens recruited James Fenton to the International Socialists.

==Career==

===Journalistic career in the UK (1971–1981)===
Early in his career Hitchens began working as a correspondent for the magazine &quot;International Socialism&quot;, published by the International Socialists, the forerunners of today&#x27;s British Socialist Workers Party. This group was broadly Trotskyist, but differed from more orthodox Trotskyist groups in its refusal to defend communist states as &quot;workers&#x27; states&quot;. Their slogan was &quot;Neither Washington nor Moscow but International Socialism&quot;.

In 1971 after spending a year travelling the United States on a scholarship, Hitchens went to work at the &quot;Times Higher Education Supplement&quot; where he served as a social science correspondent. Hitchens was fired after six months in the job. Next he was a researcher for ITV&#x27;s &quot;Weekend World&quot;.

In 1973 Hitchens went to work for the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, where his colleagues included the authors Martin Amis, whom he had briefly met at Oxford, as well as Julian Barnes and James Fenton, with whom he had shared a house in Oxford. Amis described him at the time as, &quot;handsome, festive [and] gauntly left-wing&quot;. Around that time, the Friday lunches began, which were attended by writers including Clive James, Ian McEwan, Kingsley Amis, Terence Kilmartin, Robert Conquest, Al Alvarez, Peter Porter, Russell Davies and Mark Boxer. At the &quot;New Statesman&quot; Hitchens acquired a reputation as a left-winger while working as a war correspondent from areas of conflict such as Northern Ireland, Libya, and Iraq.

In November 1973, while in Greece, Hitchens reported on the constitutional crisis of the military junta. It became his first leading article for the &quot;New Statesman&quot;. In December 1977 Hitchens interviewed Argentine dictator Jorge Rafael Videla, a conversation he later described as &quot;horrifying&quot;. In 1977, unhappy at the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, Hitchens defected to the &quot;Daily Express&quot; where he became a foreign correspondent. He returned to the &quot;New Statesman&quot; in 1978 where he became assistant editor and then foreign editor.

===American writings (1981–2011)===
Hitchens went to the United States in 1981 as part of an editor exchange programme between the &quot;New Statesman&quot; and &quot;The Nation&quot;. After joining &quot;The Nation&quot;, he penned vociferous critiques of Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush and American foreign policy in South and Central America.

Hitchens became a contributing editor of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; in 1992, writing ten columns a year. He left &quot;The Nation&quot; in 2002 after profoundly disagreeing with other contributors over the Iraq War.

There is speculation that Hitchens was the inspiration for Tom Wolfe&#x27;s character Peter Fallow in the 1987 novel &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot;, but others—including Hitchens—believe it to be &quot;Spy Magazine&quot;″s &quot;Ironman Nightlife Decathlete&quot;, Anthony Haden-Guest. In 1987, Hitchens&#x27;s father died from cancer of the oesophagus, the same disease that would later claim his own life. In April 2007, Hitchens became a US citizen; he later stated that he saw himself as &quot;Anglo-American&quot;.

He became a media fellow at the Hoover Institution in September 2008. At &quot;Slate&quot;, he usually wrote under the news-and-politics column &quot;Fighting Words&quot;.

Hitchens spent part of his early career in journalism as a foreign correspondent in Cyprus. Through his work there he met his first wife, Eleni Meleagrou, a Greek Cypriot, with whom he had two children, Alexander and Sophia. His son, Alexander Meleagrou-Hitchens, born in 1984, has worked as a policy researcher in London. Hitchens continued writing essay-style correspondence pieces from a variety of locales, including Chad, Uganda and the Darfur region of Sudan. In 1991, he received a Lannan Literary Award for Nonfiction.

Hitchens met Carol Blue in Los Angeles in 1989 and they married in 1991. Hitchens called it love at first sight. In 1999, Hitchens and Blue, both harsh critics of President Clinton, submitted an affidavit to the trial managers of the Republican Party in the impeachment of Bill Clinton. Therein they swore that their then-friend Sidney Blumenthal had described Monica Lewinsky as a stalker. This allegation contradicted Blumenthal&#x27;s own sworn deposition in the trial, and it resulted in a hostile exchange of opinion in the public sphere between Hitchens and Blumenthal. Following the publication of Blumenthal&#x27;s &quot;The Clinton Wars,&quot; Hitchens wrote several pieces in which he accused Blumenthal of manipulating the facts. The incident ended their friendship and sparked a personal crisis for Hitchens, who was stridently criticised by friends for what they saw as a cynical and ultimately politically futile act.

Before Hitchens&#x27;s political shift, the American author and polemicist Gore Vidal was apt to speak of Hitchens as his &quot;dauphin&quot; or &quot;heir&quot;. In 2010 Hitchens attacked Vidal in a &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; piece headlined &quot;Vidal Loco&quot;, calling him a &quot;crackpot&quot; for his adoption of 9/11 conspiracy theories. On the back of Hitchens&#x27;s memoir &quot;Hitch-22,&quot; among the praise from notable figures, Vidal&#x27;s endorsement of Hitchens as his successor is crossed out in red and annotated &quot;NO, C.H.&quot; Hitchens&#x27;s strong advocacy of the war in Iraq gained him a wider readership, and in September 2005 he was named as fifth on the list of the &quot;Top 100 Public Intellectuals&quot; by &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; and &quot;Prospect&quot; magazines. An online poll ranked the 100 intellectuals, but the magazines noted that the rankings of Hitchens (5), Noam Chomsky (1), and Abdolkarim Soroush (15) were partly due to their respective supporters&#x27; publicising of the vote. Hitchens later responded to his ranking with a few articles about his status as such.

Hitchens did not leave his position writing for &quot;The Nation&quot; until after the 11 September attacks, stating that he felt the magazine had arrived at a position &quot;that John Ashcroft is a greater menace than Osama bin Laden&quot;. The 11 September attacks &quot;exhilarated&quot; him, bringing into focus &quot;a battle between everything I love and everything I hate&quot; and strengthening his embrace of an interventionist foreign policy that challenged &quot;fascism with an Islamic face&quot;. His numerous editorials in support of the Iraq War caused some to label him a neoconservative, although Hitchens insisted he was not &quot;a conservative of any kind&quot;, and his friend Ian McEwan described him as representing the anti-totalitarian left. Hitchens recalls in his memoir having been &quot;invited by Bernard-Henri Lévy to write an essay on political reconsiderations for his magazine &quot;&quot;. I gave it the partly ironic title: &#x27;Can One Be a Neoconservative?&#x27; Impatient with this, some copy editor put it on the cover as &#x27;How I Became a Neoconservative.&#x27; Perhaps this was an instance of the Cartesian principle as opposed to the English empiricist one: It was decided that I evidently was what I apparently only thought.&quot; Indeed, in a 2010 BBC interview, he stated that he &quot;still [thought] like a Marxist&quot; and considered himself &quot;a leftist&quot;.

In 2007, Hitchens published one of his most controversial articles titled &quot;Why Women Aren&#x27;t Funny&quot; in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. While providing no empirical evidence, he argued that there is less societal pressure for women to practice humour and that &quot;women who do it play by men&#x27;s rules&quot;. Over the following year, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; published several letters that it received, objecting to the tone or premise of the article, as well as a rebuttal by Alessandra Stanley. Amid further criticism, Hitchens reiterated his position in a video and written response.

In 2007 Hitchens&#x27;s work for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; won the National Magazine Award in the category &quot;Columns and Commentary&quot;.
He was a finalist in the same category in 2008 for some of his columns in &quot;Slate&quot; but lost out to Matt Taibbi of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. &quot;Hitch-22&quot; was short-listed for the 2010 National Book Critics Circle Award for Autobiography. He won the National Magazine Award for Columns about Cancer in 2011. Hitchens also served on the advisory board of Secular Coalition for America and offered advice to the Coalition on the acceptance and inclusion of nontheism in American life. In December 2011, prior to his death, Asteroid 57901 Hitchens was named after him.

===Literature reviews===
Hitchens wrote a monthly essay in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; and occasionally contributed to other literary journals. One of his books, &quot;Unacknowledged Legislation: Writers in the Public Sphere&quot;, collected these works. In &quot;Why Orwell Matters&quot;, he defends Orwell&#x27;s writings against modern critics as relevant today and progressive for his time. In the 2008 book &quot;Christopher Hitchens and His Critics: Terror, Iraq, and the Left&quot;, many literary critiques are included of essays and other books of writers, such as David Horowitz and Edward Said.

During a three-hour &quot;In Depth&quot; interview on Book TV, he named authors who influenced his views, including Aldous Huxley, George Orwell, Evelyn Waugh, Kingsley Amis, P. G. Wodehouse and Conor Cruise O&#x27;Brien. When asked what the difference between an autobiography and a memoir was, he replied
: &quot;Look, everyone has a book inside of them ... which is exactly where I think it should, in most cases, remain&quot;.

===Professorships===
Hitchens was a visiting professor in the following institutions:
* University of California, Berkeley
* The University of Pittsburgh
* The New School of Social Research

===Relationship with his brother===
Journalist and author Peter Hitchens is Christopher&#x27;s younger brother by two years. Christopher said in 2005 the main difference between the two is belief in the existence of God. Peter became a member of the International Socialists (forerunners of the modern Socialist Workers&#x27; Party) from 1968 to 1975 (beginning at age 17) after Christopher introduced him to them.

The brothers reportedly fell out after Peter wrote a 2001 article in &quot;The Spectator&quot; which allegedly characterised Christopher as a Stalinist. After the birth of Peter&#x27;s third child, the brothers were reconciled. Peter&#x27;s review of &quot;God Is Not Great&quot; led to a public argument between the brothers but no renewed estrangement.

In 2007 the brothers appeared as panellists on BBC TV&#x27;s &quot;Question Time&quot;, where they clashed on a number of issues. In 2008, in the US, they debated the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the existence of God. In 2010 at the Pew Forum, the pair debated the nature of God in civilisation. At the memorial service held for Christopher in New York, Peter read a passage from St Paul&#x27;s Epistle to the Philippians.

==Political views==

In 2009 Hitchens was listed by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine as one of the &quot;25 most influential liberals in the U.S. media&quot;. The article also noted that he would &quot;likely be aghast to find himself on this list&quot;, as it reduces his self-styled radicalism to mere liberalism. Hitchens&#x27;s political perspectives also appear in his wide-ranging writings, which include many dialogues. He said of Ayn Rand&#x27;s Objectivism, &quot;I have always found it quaint, and rather touching, that there is a movement in the US that thinks Americans are not yet selfish enough.&quot;

Hitchens disagreed with the premise of a Jewish homeland and had said of himself, &quot;I am an Anti-Zionist. I&#x27;m one of those people of Jewish descent who believes that Zionism would be a mistake even if there were no Palestinians.&quot;

Having long described himself as a socialist and a Marxist, Hitchens began his break from the established political left after what he called the &quot;tepid reaction&quot; of the Western left to the controversy over &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;, followed by what he saw as the left&#x27;s embrace of Bill Clinton and the anti-war movement&#x27;s opposition to NATO intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 1990s. He later became a so-called liberal hawk and supported the War on Terror, but he had some reservations, such as his characterisation of waterboarding as torture after voluntarily undergoing the procedure. In January 2006, he joined four other individuals and four organisations, including the ACLU and Greenpeace, as plaintiffs in a lawsuit, &quot;ACLU v. NSA&quot;, challenging Bush&#x27;s NSA warrantless surveillance; the lawsuit was filed by the ACLU.

Hitchens was an avid critic of President Slobodan Milošević of Serbia and other Serbian politicians of the 1990s. He called Milošević a &quot;fascist&quot; and a &quot;Nazi&quot; after the Bosnian genocide and ethnic cleansing of Albanians in Kosovo and expressed a positive reaction to his death. Hitchens often accused the Serbian government of committing numerous war crimes during the Yugoslav Wars. He denounced people like Noam Chomsky and Edward S. Herman, who criticised the NATO intervention there. Hitchens also criticised Croatian president Franjo Tuđman and the policies of the Croatian government, which he saw as reviving &quot;Ustashe formations&quot;.

Hitchens held complex views on abortion; being ethically opposed to it in most instances, and believing that a foetus was entitled to personhood, while holding ambiguous and changing views on its legality. In a 1988 interview with &quot;Crisis Magazine&quot;, Hitchens wrote: &quot;It might interest your readers to know that Margaret Thatcher voted to keep capital punishment, to keep homosexuality criminal, to make divorce harder to get, and &quot;for&quot; the abortion bill. I gather that she&#x27;s since changed her position on the latter. My own vote would have been, as so often, exactly the reverse of hers.&quot; However, Hitchens argued that the issue was cynically used by self-described pro-life politicians, and doubted that they sincerely desired to legally prohibit abortion. In the same 1988 interview with &quot;Crisis Magazine&quot; he stated: &quot;Once you allow that the occupant of the womb is even potentially a life, it cuts athwart any glib invocation of &quot;the woman&#x27;s right to choose&quot; and that: Hitchens supported gun rights and supported same-sex marriage.

Hitchens was a supporter of the European Union. In an appearance on C-SPAN in 1993, Hitchens said, &quot;As of 1992, there is now a Euro passport that makes you free to travel within the boundaries of ... member countries, and I&#x27;ve always liked the idea of European unity, and so I held out for a Euro passport. So I travel as a European.&quot; Speaking at the launch of his brother Peter Hitchens&#x27;s book, &quot;The Abolition of Britain&quot;, at Conway Hall in London, Hitchens denounced the so-called Eurosceptic movement, describing it as &quot;the British version of fascism&quot;. He went on to say, &quot;Scepticism is a title of honour. These people are not sceptical. They&#x27;re fanatical. They&#x27;re dogmatic&quot;.

==Critiques of specific individuals==
Hitchens wrote book-length biographical essays on Thomas Jefferson (&quot;Thomas Jefferson: Author of America&quot;), Thomas Paine (&quot;Thomas Paine&#x27;s &#x27;Rights of Man&#x27;: A biography&quot;), and George Orwell (&quot;Why Orwell Matters&quot;).

He also became known for excoriating criticisms of public contemporary figures, including Mother Teresa, Bill Clinton, and Henry Kissinger, the subjects of three full-length texts: &quot;The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice&quot;, &quot;No One Left to Lie To: The Triangulations of William Jefferson Clinton&quot;, and &quot;The Trial of Henry Kissinger&quot;.

Writers Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy published an article in &quot;Time&quot; in 2007, claiming that Hitchens, while promoting his book &quot;God Is Not Great: How religion poisons everything&quot;, described the Christian evangelist Billy Graham as &quot;a self-conscious fraud&quot; and &quot;a disgustingly evil man&quot; and that the evangelist had made a living by &quot;going around spouting lies to young people. What a horrible career. I gather it&#x27;s soon to be over. I certainly hope so.&quot;

They challenged Hitchens&#x27;s suggestion that Graham went into ministry to make money. They argued that during his career Graham &quot;turn[ed] down million-dollar television and Hollywood offers&quot;. They also pointed out that having established the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association in 1950, Graham drew a straight salary, comparable to that of a senior minister, irrespective of the money raised by his meetings.

In 1999, Hitchens wrote a profile of Donald Trump for &quot;The Sunday Herald&quot;. Trump had expressed interest in running in the 2000 United States presidential election as a candidate for the Reform Party. Of Trump, Hitchens said:

Hitchens had previously written that Trump demonstrated how &quot;nobody is more covetous and greedy than those who have far too much.&quot;

==Criticism of religion==

Hitchens was an antitheist, and said that a person &quot;could be an atheist and wish that belief in God were correct&quot;, but that &quot;an antitheist, a term I&#x27;m trying to get into circulation, is someone who is relieved that there&#x27;s no evidence for such an assertion.&quot; He often spoke against the Abrahamic religions. When asked by readers of &quot;The Independent&quot; (London) what he considered to be the &quot;axis of evil&quot;, Hitchens replied &quot;Christianity, Judaism, Islam – the three leading monotheisms.&quot; In debates Hitchens often posed what has become known as &quot;Hitchens&#x27;s Challenge&quot;: to name at least one moral action that a person without a faith (e.g., an atheist or antitheist) could not possibly perform, and conversely, to name one immoral action that only a person with a faith could perform or has performed in the past.

In his best-seller &quot;God Is Not Great&quot;, Hitchens expanded his criticism to include all religions, including those rarely criticised by Western secularists, such as Hinduism, Buddhism and neo-paganism. Hitchens said that organised religion is &quot;the main source of hatred in the world&quot;, calling it &quot;violent, irrational, intolerant, allied to racism, tribalism, and bigotry, invested in ignorance and hostile to free inquiry, contemptuous of women and coercive toward children: [it] ought to have a great deal on its conscience&quot;. In the same work Hitchens says that humanity therefore needs a renewed Enlightenment. The book received mixed responses, ranging from praise in &quot;The New York Times&quot; for his &quot;logical flourishes and conundrums&quot; to accusations of &quot;intellectual and moral shabbiness&quot; in the &quot;Financial Times&quot;. &quot;God Is Not Great&quot; was nominated for a National Book Award on 10 October 2007.

&quot;God Is Not Great&quot; affirmed Hitchens&#x27;s position in the &quot;New Atheism&quot; movement. Hitchens was made an Honorary Associate of the Rationalist International and the National Secular Society shortly after its release and he was later named to the Honorary Board of distinguished achievers of the Freedom From Religion Foundation. He also joined the advisory board of the Secular Coalition for America, a group of atheists and humanists. Hitchens said he would accept an invitation from any religious leader who wished to debate with him. On 30 September 2007, Richard Dawkins, Hitchens, Sam Harris, and Daniel Dennett met at Hitchens&#x27;s residence for a private, unmoderated discussion lasting two hours. The event was videotaped and entitled &quot;The Four Horsemen&quot;. In it, Hitchens stated at one point that he saw the Maccabean Revolt as the most unfortunate event in human history due to the reversion from Hellenistic thought and philosophy to messianism and fundamentalism that its success constituted.

That year Hitchens began a series of written debates on the question &quot;Is Christianity Good for the World?&quot; with Christian theologian and pastor Douglas Wilson, published in &quot;Christianity Today&quot; magazine. This exchange eventually became a book with the same title published in 2008. During their promotional tour of the book, they were accompanied by the producer Darren Doane&#x27;s film crew. Thence Doane produced the film &quot;Collision: Is Christianity GOOD for the World?,&quot; which was released on 27 October 2009. On 4 April 2009, Hitchens debated William Lane Craig on the existence of God at Biola University. On 19 October 2009, Intelligence Squared explored the question &quot;Is the Catholic Church a force for good in the world?&quot;. John Onaiyekan and Ann Widdecombe argued that it was, while Hitchens joined Stephen Fry in arguing that it was not. The latter side won the debate according to an audience poll. On 5 October 2010, Hitchens debated with Tariq Ramadan, as to whether Islam was a religion of peace, at 92NY. On 26 November 2010, Hitchens appeared in Toronto, Ontario, at the Munk Debates, where he debated religion with former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, a convert to Roman Catholicism. Blair argued religion is a force for good, while Hitchens argued against that.

Throughout these debates, Hitchens became known for his persuasive and enthusiastic rhetoric in public speaking. &quot;Wit and eloquence&quot;, &quot;verbal barbs and linguistic dexterity&quot; and &quot;self-reference, literary engagement and hyperbole&quot; are all elements of his speeches. The term &quot;hitch-slap&quot; has been used as an informal term among his supporters for a carefully crafted remark designed to humiliate his opponents. Hitchens&#x27;s line &quot;one asks wistfully if there is no provision in the procedures of military justice for them to be taken out and shot,&quot; condemning the perpetrators of the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse, was cited by &quot;The Humanist&quot; as an example. A tribute in &quot;Politico&quot; stated that this was a trait Hitchens shared with fellow atheist and intellectual Gore Vidal.

==Personal life==

Hitchens was raised nominally Christian and attended Christian boarding schools, but from an early age he declined to participate in communal prayers. Later in life, Hitchens discovered that he was of Jewish descent on his mother&#x27;s side and that his Jewish ancestors were immigrants from Eastern Europe (including Poland). Hitchens was married twice, first to Eleni Meleagrou, a Greek Cypriot, in 1981; the couple had a son, Alexander, and a daughter, Sophia.

In 1991 Hitchens married his second wife, Carol Blue, an American screenwriter, in a ceremony held at the apartment of Victor Navasky, editor of &quot;The Nation&quot;. They had a daughter together, Antonia.

Hitchens considered reading, writing, and public speaking not as a job or career but as &quot;what I am, who I am, [and] what I love.&quot;

In November 1973 Hitchens&#x27;s mother died by suicide in Athens in a pact with her lover, a defrocked clergyman named Timothy Bryan. The pair overdosed on sleeping pills in adjoining hotel rooms and Bryan slashed his wrists in the bathtub. Hitchens flew alone to Athens to recover his mother&#x27;s body, initially under the impression that she had been murdered.

In 2007, after living in the United States for twenty-five years, he became an American citizen, electing to retain his UK citizenship.

==Illness and death==
On 8 June 2010, Hitchens was on tour in New York promoting his memoirs &quot;Hitch-22&quot; when he was taken into emergency care suffering from a severe pericardial effusion. Soon after, he announced he was postponing his tour to undergo treatment for oesophageal cancer.

In a &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; piece published in 2010, titled &quot;Topic of Cancer&quot;, he stated that he was undergoing treatment for cancer. He said that he recognised the long-term prognosis was far from positive and he would be a &quot;very lucky person to live another five years&quot;. A heavy smoker and drinker since his teenage years, Hitchens acknowledged that these habits were likely to have contributed to his illness. During his illness, Hitchens was under the care of Francis Collins and was the subject of Collins&#x27;s new cancer treatment, which maps out the human genome and selectively targets damaged DNA.

According to Christopher Buckley, before Hitchens died, his estranged friend Sidney Blumenthal wrote to Hitchens. Buckley said the letter contained words of &quot;tenderness and comfort and implicit forgiveness&quot;.

Hitchens died of pneumonia on 15 December 2011 in the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, aged 62.

According to Andrew Sullivan, his last words were &quot;Capitalism. Downfall.&quot;

In accordance with his wishes, his body was donated to medical research. &quot;Mortality&quot;, a collection of seven of Hitchens&#x27;s &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; essays about his illness, was published in September 2012.

===Reactions to death===

Former British prime minister Tony Blair said, &quot;Christopher Hitchens was a complete one-off, an amazing mixture of writer, journalist, polemicist and unique character. He was fearless in the pursuit of truth and any cause in which he believed. And there was no belief he held that he did not advocate with passion, commitment and brilliance. He was an extraordinary, compelling and colourful human being whom it was a privilege to know.&quot;

Richard Dawkins said of Hitchens, &quot;He was a polymath, a wit, immensely knowledgeable, and a valiant fighter against all tyrants, including imaginary supernatural ones.&quot; Dawkins later described Hitchens as &quot;probably the best orator I&#x27;ve ever heard&quot;, and called his death &quot;an enormous loss&quot;.
 American theoretical physicist and cosmologist Lawrence Krauss said

Bill Maher paid tribute to Hitchens on his show &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot;, saying, &quot;We lost a hero of mine, a friend, and one of the great talk show guests of all time.&quot;
Salman Rushdie and Stephen Fry paid tribute at the Christopher Hitchens Vanity Fair Memorial 2012.

British conservative author and friend of Hitchens Douglas Murray paid tribute to Hitchens in an article in &quot;The Spectator&quot;, recalling personal experiences with him.

Three weeks before Hitchens&#x27;s death, George Eaton of the &quot;New Statesman&quot; wrote, &quot;He is determined to ensure that he is not remembered simply as a &#x27;lefty who turned right&#x27; or as a contrarian and provocateur. Throughout his career, he has retained a commitment to the Enlightenment values of reason, secularism, and pluralism. His targets—Mother Teresa, Bill Clinton, Henry Kissinger, God—are chosen not at random, but rather because they have offended one or more of these principles. The tragedy of Hitchens&#x27;s illness is that it came at a time when he enjoyed a larger audience than ever. The great polemicist is certain to be remembered, but, as he was increasingly aware, perhaps not as he would like.&quot; &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; asked if Hitchens was the last public intellectual.

===The Hitchens Prize===
In 2015, an annual prize of $50,000 was established in his honour by The Dennis and Victoria Ross Foundation for &quot;an author or journalist whose work reflects a commitment to free expression and inquiry, a range and depth of intellect, and a willingness to pursue the truth without regard to personal or professional consequence&quot;. The foundation&#x27;s website states the Hitchens Prize &quot;seeks to advance what he was dedicated to throughout his life: vigorous, honest, and open public debate and discussion, with no tolerance of orthodoxy, no reverence for authority, and a belief in reasoned dialogue as the best path to the truth&quot;. The 2024 winner was Errol Morris.

<text>Richard Nott Antrim (December 17, 1907 – March 7, 1969) was an officer in the United States Navy who received the United States&#x27; highest military decoration—the Medal of Honor—for his actions as a prisoner of war during World War II. He retired in 1954 as a rear admiral.

==Early life and career==
Antrim was born in Peru, Indiana, and entered Naval Reserve in 1926. He received an appointment to the United States Naval Academy in 1927 and graduated on June 4, 1931. He married Mary Jean Packard shortly before he graduated. He served briefly in the 11th Naval District before reporting to the battleship as fire control officer. Detached from that battleship in April 1932, he received flight instruction at the Naval Air Station (NAS), Pensacola, Florida, before serving consecutive tours of sea duty on the , and .

Subsequently, ordered to the Bethlehem Steel Corporation in Quincy, Massachusetts, Antrim assisted in fitting out and after her commissioning, served as a division officer in that heavy cruiser until the spring of 1936. After that time, he became assistant first lieutenant in before undergoing instruction in lighter-than-air (LTA) flight at NAS Lakehurst, New Jersey. Antrim subsequently received his naval aviator (LTA) designation, qualified for duty as an airship, kite, or free-balloon pilot. In the spring of 1938, Antrim arrived on the Asiatic Station and served as executive officer of before joining in December 1939, as her executive officer. The outbreak of war in the Pacific Ocean in December 1941 found Antrim still serving in that capacity.

==World War II==
During her brief wartime career, &quot;Pope&quot; played a significant part in three major engagements fought by the venerable Asiatic Fleet destroyers—the battles of Balikpapan, Badung Strait, and the Java Sea.

In the former, &quot;Pope&quot; delivered close-range attacks that momentarily helped to delay the Japanese landings at Balikpapan. During the action, Lieutenant Antrim selected targets for his guns and torpedoes, placing his shots accurately in the midst of a large Japanese convoy and thus inflicting damage to several enemy ships. After the Battle of Badung Strait, &quot;Pope&#x27;s&quot; commanding officer, Commander Welford C. Blinn, reported that his executive officer was &quot;highly deserving of commendation for the meritorious performance of his several duties before and throughout the action.&quot; Citing Antrim as a &quot;ready assistant in navigation fire control, and torpedo fire,&quot; Blinn recommended him not only for a destroyer command but for a &quot;decoration deemed appropriate.&quot; Antrim later received a Navy Cross for this service.

The Battle of the Java Sea (27 to February 28, 1942) ended all Allied hope of stemming the Japanese onslaught. In the wake of that action, the smashed Allied fleet attempted to escape the cordon of Japanese warships rapidly tightening the noose around Java. Among the small groups was one composed of the British heavy cruiser , the destroyer , and &quot;Pope&quot;.

The ships slipped out of Surabaya, Java, on the evening of February 28, but were spotted the next day by Japanese aircraft. A surface force of cruisers and destroyers located the fleeing trio, and a fierce action ensued, with &quot;Exeter&quot; and &quot;Encounter&quot; after having put up a stiff fight, going down under a deluge of Japanese shells. &quot;Pope&quot;, however, fought on, managing to make a temporary haven in a passing rain squall.

Unfortunately, the destroyer—an Asiatic Fleet flush decker &quot;old enough to vote&quot;—could not elude her pursuers. Ultimately, damaged by Japanese bombs, from aircraft summoned from the Japanese carrier &quot; Ryūjō&quot;, and by shells from the Japanese force, &quot;Pope&quot; began to sink, but not before all but one of her men had reached safety in life rafts and the destroyer&#x27;s sole motor whaleboat. Antrim, wounded in the action, helped to gather the life rafts around the boat to facilitate the distribution of what meager supplies were available to the men. His devotion to duty during the ordeal inspired and sustained his shipmates&#x27; morale.

== Prisoner of war ==
For three days and nights, Pope&#x27;s survivors stuck together as a group until picked up by a Japanese warship and handed over to Japanese Army authorities at Makassar, in the Celebes Islands.

During the early part of his imprisonment at Makassar in April 1942, Antrim saw a Japanese guard brutally beating an American prisoner of war, Lt.(jg) Allan Jack Fisher, (SC), and successfully intervened, at great risk to his own life. For his conspicuous act of valor, Antrim later received the Medal of Honor.

Subsequently when the Japanese forced Antrim to take charge of a labor detail assigned the task of constructing slit trenches for protection during air raids, he carefully rearranged the construction work plans approved by the Japanese and gained their approval of his own ideas. Under the eyes of their captors, the POWs dug the slit trenches correctly, but in a curious pattern recognizable from the air as a giant US which clearly and craftily identified the occupants of the trenches. This audacious action possibly saved hundreds of prisoners of war from mistaken bombings by Allied planes. Antrim carried out the plan in spite of the fact that discovery of his trick would have resulted in instant beheading. For this, Antrim received a Bronze Star.

==Post-war activities==
Ultimately liberated after the war in the Far East ended in August 1945, Antrim returned to the United States and enjoyed rehabilitation leave before attending the Repatriated POW Refresher Course at the Washington Navy Yard, Washington, D.C. in May 1946. He then brushed up on his pilot training at NAS Lakehurst and later completed a course at the Naval War College. Antrim—who had been listed as missing since the sinking of &quot;Pope&quot; in March 1942—received the Medal of Honor and Bronze Star Medal from President Harry S. Truman in ceremonies at the White House on January 30, 1947.

Later, following a brief stint at the Fleet Sonar School, San Diego, California, in June and July 1947, Antrim went to sea in command of the destroyer . He next underwent further instruction at NAS Lakehurst, before assuming the duties of Assistant for Lighter-than-Air Planning and Programs Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), Washington, D.C., in December 1948.

Following further Washington duty—with the Policy Advisory Staff, Department of State, and the Psychological Strategy Board—Antrim commanded the attack transport during the Korean War before returning to the capital for a brief tour of duty as Head, Amphibious Warfare Matters Section, Office of the CNO, prior to his retirement on April 1, 1954. He was advanced to rear admiral on the retired list on the basis of his combat awards.

==Later life==
Rear Admiral Antrim died in Mountain Home, Arkansas on March 7, 1969. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, in Arlington, Virginia.

==Awards and decorations==
His decorations include:


===Medal of Honor citation===
For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while interned as a prisoner of war of the enemy Japanese in the city of Makassar, Celebes, Netherlands East Indies, in April 1942. Acting instantly on behalf of a naval officer who was subjected to a vicious clubbing by a frenzied Japanese guard venting his insane wrath upon the helpless prisoner, Comdr. (then Lt.) Antrim boldly intervened, attempting to quiet the guard and finally persuading him to discuss the charges against the officer. With the entire Japanese force assembled and making extraordinary preparations for the threatened beating, and with the tension heightened by 2,700 Allied prisoners rapidly closing in, Comdr. Antrim courageously appealed to the fanatic enemy, risking his own life in a desperate effort to mitigate the punishment. When the other had been beaten unconscious by 15 blows of a hawser and was repeatedly kicked by 3 soldiers to a point beyond which he could not survive, Comdr. Antrim gallantly stepped forward and indicated to the perplexed guards that he would take the remainder of the punishment, throwing the Japanese completely off balance in their amazement and eliciting a roar of acclaim from the suddenly inspired Allied prisoners. By his fearless leadership and valiant concern for the welfare of another, he not only saved the life of a fellow officer and stunned the Japanese into sparing his own life but also brought about a new respect for American officers and men and a great improvement in camp living conditions. His heroic conduct throughout reflects the highest credit upon Comdr. Antrim and the U.S. Naval Service.

==Posthumous honor==

In 1979, the was named in his honor.

<text>José Eloy Alfaro Delgado (25 June 1842 – 28 January 1912) often referred to as &quot;The Old Warrior,&quot; was an Ecuadorian politician who served as the President of Ecuador from 1895 to 1901 and from 1906 to 1911. Eloy Alfaro emerged as the leader of the Liberal Party and became a driving force for fairness, justice and liberty. He became one of the strongest opponents of the pro-Catholic conservative President Gabriel García Moreno (1821–1875). The &quot;Viejo Luchador&quot; (in Spanish) played a central role in the Liberal Revolution of 1895 and fought against conservatism for almost 30 years. 

Alfaro&#x27;s major political legacies are considered to be strengthened national unity, securing the integrity of Ecuador&#x27;s borders, and the increased secularization of the country. Alfaro led the modernization of Ecuadorian society through the introduction of new ideas, education, and systems of public transport and communication, including the engineering feat of the Transandino Railway linking Guayaquil with Quito. Alfaro&#x27;s effigy appeared on the Ecuadorian 50-cent coin from the 2000 issue, and the Ecuadorian Army&#x27;s military college bears his name, as have two ships of the Ecuadorian Navy.

==Biography==

===Rebellious youth===
Alfaro was born in Montecristi, Manabí, on 25 June 1842. His father was don Manuel Alfaro y González, a Spanish Republican native of Cervera del Río Alhama, La Rioja, Spain who arrived in Ecuador as a political exile; his mother was doña María Natividad Delgado López.

Alfaro received his primary education in his place of birth. After graduation he dedicated himself to helping his father with his business negotiations. During his youth he aligned himself with anticlerical liberalism, a doctrine later embodied in the Ecuadorian Radical Liberal Party. He fought against Presidents García Moreno, Borrero, Veintemilla and Camaño, and as a result he is traditionally known as the &quot;Viejo Luchador&quot; (Old Warrior). Eloy Alfaro experienced many serious difficulties in the various campaigns he initiated against the conservative Ecuadorian governments. He spent his fortune, acquired with the help of his Panamanian wife, Ana Paredes Arosemena, in those battles. Nine children were born of their marriage: Bolívar, Esmeraldas, Colombia, Colón, Bolívar(2), Ana María, América, Olmedo, and Colón Eloy; Rafael was born out of wedlock.

From a very early age Alfaro participated in acts of rebellion. He almost lost his life in the disastrous naval battle of Alajuela when he tried to disembark in Ecuador with a troop of revolutionaries and was defeated by Conservative Government forces. When his ship sank, he saved himself from drowning by clinging to a barrel. He participated in the battles of Montecristi, San Mateo, Esmeraldas, Guayaquil, Jaramijó, Gatazo, Cuenca, and Chasqui.

Alfaro was a model father and was magnanimous with friends and the destitute. He supported various liberals, such as the writer Juan Montalvo, to whom he offered monetary assistance. Once in power, he glorified the memory of Montalvo as a great teacher and an example to the Ecuadorian people. Even though Alfaro was not very well-educated, through force of character he was able to overcome this fault and impress others with his clear intelligence. During his exile, he travelled Central America and was granted the rank of &quot;General de División&quot; by the Nicaraguan Congress.

===First presidency (1895–1901)===
Alfaro, head of the Radical Liberals, was the leader of the Ecuadorian Liberal Revolution, carrying out a struggle that he waged from his youth in the 1860s until 1895 when the liberals finally took power in a coup d&#x27;état. In this uprising, he deposed President Vicente Lucio Salazar and declared himself a dictator on 5 June 1895 and was later named &quot;constitutional president&quot; from 17 January 1897 until 1 September 1901. The principal accomplishment of his first government was the introduction of the principle of secularism. Many public buildings in Quito including the Instituto Nacional Mejía and the first purpose build siege of the National Polytechnic School were commissioned in his administration to French architects.

===Second presidency (1906–1911)===
After initially supporting, but later coming to oppose, his successor, in 1906 he led another revolt, deposing elected President Lizardo García, being declared supreme dictator by the army and continuing in office until 12 August 1911. During this second presidency he enacted a number of changes, among them freedom of speech and the legalization of civil marriage and divorce. He constructed numerous public schools and inaugurated the right to a free and secular education. What is considered to be his greatest public work during this period was the completion of the Ferrocarril Transandino (Trans-Andean Railroad) connecting Guayaquil to Quito. Consistent with his anticlericalism, he suppressed the influence of the Catholic Church while in office. He seized much property of the Church, expelled religious orders and prohibited the establishment of any new monasteries or convents. His attempts to secularize Ecuadorian society were opposed by the Archbishop of Quito Federico González Suárez.

In 1911, he was removed from office by his former supporters. In 1911 he tried to strike a blow at the State in an attempt to return to power. He was captured near Guayaquil and sent to Quito on the railroad he had constructed. After he left office, during the administration of Emilio Estrada Carmona, Alfaro was severely critical of the government and his followers soon began to organize a series of military insurrections. Alfaro was exiled to Panama during the interim government of Carlos Freile Zaldumbide. He returned to Ecuador on 4 January 1912, and attempted another coup but was defeated, arrested and jailed by General Leonidas Plaza.

===Assassination===

On 28 January 1912, a group of pro-Catholic soldiers whose motto was &quot;Muerte al indio Alfaro&quot; (death to the Indian Alfaro), supported by a mob, broke into the prison where Alfaro and his colleagues were detained and dragged them along the cobbled streets of the city center. They were all dead when the horde arrived at the esplanade of El Ejido (city gardens) in the northern outskirts of town. The crowd finally burnt the corpses in the area where the present day park of El Ejido is located. (A monument was erected in the 1960s at the site.) Days later, Alfaro&#x27;s remains were buried in Quito, in secret. They were transported to Guayaquil and deposited in a mausoleum there at some time in the 1940s. On the initiative of President Rafael Correa (in office from 2007 – 2017), some of the ashes of Eloy Alfaro were exhumed and re-interred with honors in the city of Montecristi, seat of the 2008 National Constitutional Convention.

<doc id="229017" wikidata="Q283673" url="?curid=229017" title="Latissimus dorsi muscle">
<text>The latissimus dorsi () is a large, flat muscle on the back that stretches to the sides, behind the arm, and is partly covered by the trapezius on the back near the midline. 

The word latissimus dorsi (plural: &quot;latissimi dorsi&quot;) comes from Latin and means &quot;broadest [muscle] of the back&quot;, from &quot;latissimus&quot; () and &quot;dorsum&quot; (). The pair of muscles are commonly known as &quot;lats&quot;, especially among bodybuilders.

The latissimus dorsi is responsible for extension, adduction, transverse extension also known as horizontal abduction (or horizontal extension), flexion from an extended position, and (medial) internal rotation of the shoulder joint. It also has a synergistic role in extension and lateral flexion of the lumbar spine.

Due to bypassing the scapulothoracic joints and attaching directly to the spine, the actions the latissimi dorsi have on moving the arms can also influence the movement of the scapulae, such as their downward rotation during a pull up.

==Structure==

===Variations===

The number of dorsal vertebrae, to which it is attached, varies from four to eight; the number of costal attachments varies; muscle fibers may or may not reach the crest of the ilium.

A muscle slip, the axillary arch, varying from 7 to 10 cm in length, and from 5 to 15 mm in breadth, occasionally springs from the upper edge of the latissimus dorsi about the middle of the posterior fold of the axilla, and crosses the axilla in front of the axillary vessels and nerves, to join the under surface of the tendon of the pectoralis major, the coracobrachialis, or the fascia over the biceps brachii. This axillary arch crosses the axillary artery, just above the spot usually selected for the application of a ligature, and may mislead a surgeon. It is present in about 7% of the population and may be easily recognized by the transverse direction of its fibers. Guy &quot;et al.&quot; extensively described this muscular variant using MRI data and positively correlated its presence with symptoms of neurological impingement.

A fibrous slip usually passes from the upper border of the tendon of the Latissimus dorsi, near its insertion, to the long head of the triceps brachii. This is occasionally muscular, and is the representative of the dorsoepitrochlearis brachii of apes. This muscular form is found in ~5% of humans and is sometimes termed the latissimocondyloideus.

The latissimus dorsi crosses the inferior angle of the scapula. A study found that, of 100 cadavers dissected:
* 43% had &quot;a substantial amount&quot; of fibers in the latissimus dorsi originating from the scapula.
* 36% had few or no muscular fibers, but a &quot;soft fibrous link&quot; between the scapula and the latissimus dorsi
* 21% had little or no connecting tissue between the two structures.

===Triangles===
* The lateral margin of the latissimus dorsi is separated below from the obliquus externus abdominis by a small triangular interval, the &quot;lumbar triangle of Petit&quot;, the base of which is formed by the iliac crest, and its floor by the obliquus internus abdominis.
* Another triangle is situated behind the scapula. It is bounded above by the trapezius, below by the latissimus dorsi, and laterally by the vertebral border of the scapula; the floor is partly formed by the rhomboideus major. If the scapula is drawn forward by folding the arms across the chest, and the trunk bent forward, parts of the sixth and seventh ribs and the interspace between them become subcutaneous and available for auscultation. The space is therefore known as the &quot;triangle of auscultation&quot;.
*The latissimus dorsi can be remembered best for insertion as &quot;A Miss Between Two Majors&quot;. As the latissimus dorsi inserts into the floor of the intertubercular groove of the humerus it is surrounded by two major muscles. The teres major inserts medially on the medial lip of the intertubercular groove and the pectoralis major inserts laterally onto the lateral lip.

===Nerve supply===
The latissimus dorsi is innervated by the sixth, seventh, and eighth cervical nerves through the thoracodorsal (long subscapular) nerve. Electromyography suggests that it consists of six groups of muscle fibres that can be independently coordinated by the central nervous system.

==Function==
The latissimus dorsi assists in depression of the arm with the teres major and pectoralis major. It adducts, extends, and internally rotates the shoulder. When the arms are in a fixed overhead position, the latissimus dorsi pulls the trunk upward and forward.

It has a synergistic role in extension (posterior fibers) and lateral flexion (anterior fibers) of the lumbar spine, and assists as a muscle of both forced expiration (anterior fibers) and an accessory muscle of inspiration (posterior fibers).

Most latissimus dorsi exercises concurrently recruit the teres major, posterior fibres of the deltoid, long head of the triceps brachii, among numerous other stabilizing muscles. Compound exercises for the &#x27;lats&#x27; typically involve elbow flexion and tend to recruit the biceps brachii, brachialis, and brachioradialis for this function. Depending on the line of pull, the trapezius muscles can be recruited as well; horizontal pulling motions such as rows recruit both latissimus dorsi and trapezius heavily.

===Training===
The power/size/strength of this muscle can be trained with a variety of different exercises. Some of these include:
* Vertical pulling movements such as pull-downs and pull-ups (including chin-ups)
* Horizontal pulling movements such as bent-over row, T-bar row and other rowing exercises
* Shoulder extension movements with straight arms such as straight-arm lat pulldowns and pull-overs
* Deadlift

==Clinical significance==
Tight latissimus dorsi has been shown to be a contributor to chronic shoulder pain and chronic back pain. Because the latissimus dorsi connects the spine to the humerus, tightness in this muscle can manifest as either sub-optimal glenohumeral joint (shoulder) function which leads to chronic pain or tendinitis in the tendinous fasciae connecting the latissimus dorsi to the thoracic and lumbar spine.

The latissimus dorsi is a potential source of muscle for breast reconstruction surgery after mastectomy (e.g., Mannu flap) or to correct pectoral hypoplastic defects such as Poland&#x27;s syndrome. An absent or hypoplastic latissimus dorsi can be one of the associated symptoms of Poland&#x27;s syndrome.

===Cardiac support===
For heart patients with low cardiac output and who are not candidates for cardiac transplantation, a procedure called &quot;cardiomyoplasty&quot; may support the failing heart. This procedure involves wrapping the latissimus dorsi muscles around the heart and electrostimulating them in synchrony with ventricular systole.

===Injury===
Injuries to the latissimus dorsi are rare. They occur disproportionately in baseball pitchers. Diagnosis can be achieved by visualization of the muscle and movement testing. MRI of the shoulder girdle will confirm the diagnosis. Muscle belly injuries are treated with rehabilitation while tendon avulsion injuries can be treated surgically, or with rehab. Regardless of treatment, patients tend to return to play without any functional losses.

<text>The Continental Blockade (), or Continental System, was a large-scale embargo by French emperor Napoleon I against the British Empire from 21 November 1806 until 11 April 1814, during the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon issued the Berlin Decree on 21 November 1806 in response to the naval blockade of the French coasts enacted by the British government on 16 May 1806. The embargo was applied intermittently, ending on 11 April 1814 after Napoleon&#x27;s first abdication.

Aside from subduing Britain, the blockade was also intended to establish French industrial and commercial hegemony in Europe. Within the French Empire, the newly acquired territories and client states were subordinate to France itself, as there was a unified market within France (no internal barriers or tariffs) while economic distortions were maintained on the borders of the new territories.

The Berlin Decree forbade the import of British goods into any European country allied with or dependent upon France, and it installed the Continental System in Europe. All connections with Britain were to be cut, even mail. However, there was extensive smuggling, which made the Continental System an ineffective weapon of economic war. There was some damage to British trade, especially in 1808 and 1812, but British control of the oceans led to replacement trade with North and South America, as well as large scale smuggling in Europe particularly from Malta, which was used by the British to sell their goods to southern Italy.

The loss of Britain as a trading partner also hit the economies of France and its allies. Angry governments gained an incentive to ignore the Continental System, which led to the weakening of Napoleon&#x27;s coalition. As Napoleon realised that extensive trade was going through Spain and Russia, he invaded those two countries. His forces were tied down in Spain, in which the Spanish War of Independence occurred simultaneously, and suffered severely in, and ultimately retreated from, Russia in 1812.

==Background==

The British government was the central force in encouraging and financing alliances against France. Napoleon was frustrated in his repeated attempts to defeat Britain. Attacks that involved naval power had all failed, with the systematic defeats of the combined French and Spanish navies. After the decisive defeat at Trafalgar, Napoleon made no attempt to rebuild his navy. He turned instead to economic warfare, planning to ruin the British economy. It was thought that Britain depended completely upon trade with Europe for its prosperity, so cutting off trade with continental Europe would ruin the British economy and force it to sue for peace. A blockade was impossible because the Royal Navy controlled the seas, but if Napoleon controlled the ports of Europe, he could prevent British products from landing.

On 16 May 1806, the Royal Navy imposed a naval blockade of the French and French-allied coasts. In turn, Napoleon resorted to economic warfare. Britain was Europe&#x27;s manufacturing and business center as a result of the Industrial Revolution. Napoleon believed it would be easy to take advantage of an embargo on trade with the European nations under his control, causing inflation and great debt to undermine British strength. His position was strengthened by the Fall of Berlin in October 1806, bringing swathes of Prussia under his control.

In November 1806, having recently conquered or allied with every major power on the European continent, Napoleon, in retaliation to the British Order in Council of 17 May 1806 blockading all ports from Brest to the Elbe, issued the Berlin Decree forbidding his allies and conquests from trading with the British. Britain responded with further orders in council issued on 10 January and 11 November 1807. These forbade French trade with Britain, its allies or neutrals, and instructed the Royal Navy to blockade all French and allied ports, and to prevent all shipping whether neutral or not. Napoleon responded again with the Milan Decree of 1807, declaring that all neutral shipping using British ports or paying British tariffs were to be regarded as British and seized.

Napoleon&#x27;s plan to defeat Britain was to destroy its ability to trade. As an island nation, trade was its most vital lifeline. Napoleon believed that if he could isolate Britain economically, he would be able to invade the nation after its economic collapse. Napoleon decreed that all commercial ships wishing to do business in Europe must first stop at a French port in order to ensure that there could be no trade with Britain. He also ordered all European nations and French allies to stop trading with Britain, and he threatened Russia with an invasion if they did not comply as well. His orders backfired in the Iberian Peninsula, especially in Portugal (being allied to Britain), setting off the Peninsular War. He pushed Russia too hard, both in terms of the Continental System, and in his demands for control over part of Poland. Napoleon&#x27;s 1812 invasion of Russia was a disaster which set the stage for his downfall.

==Effects==
===British Empire===
The Continental System had mixed effects on British trade. The embargo encouraged British merchants to seek out new markets aggressively and to engage in smuggling with continental Europe. Napoleon&#x27;s exclusively land-based customs enforcers could not stop British smugglers, especially as these operated with the connivance of Napoleon&#x27;s chosen rulers of Spain, Westphalia, and other German states. British exports to the continent fell between 25% and 55% compared to pre-1806 levels. However, trade sharply increased with the rest of the world, covering much of the decline.

In response to the Continental System, British orders in council prohibited other countries (that is, its trade partners) from trading with France. If they chose to trade with France or otherwise comply with the Continental System, the orders in council threatened to respond with punitive measures. This double threat created a difficult time for neutral nations like the United States. In response to this prohibition, the U.S. government adopted the Embargo Act of 1807 and eventually Macon&#x27;s Bill Number 2. This embargo was designed as an economic counterattack to hurt Britain, but it proved even more damaging to American merchants. Together with the issues of the impressment of American seamen, and British support for Indian resistance in U.S. colonization, tensions led to a declaration of war by the U.S. in the War of 1812. This war, not Napoleon&#x27;s blockade, sharply reduced British trade with the United States. 

The blockade did not cause significant economic damage to the British, although British exports to the continent as a proportion of the country&#x27;s total trade dropped from 55% to 25% between 1802 and 1806. However, the British economy suffered greatly from 1810 to 1812, especially in terms of high unemployment and inflation. This led to widespread protest and violence, but the middle classes and upper classes strongly supported the government, which used the Yeomanry and militia to suppress the working class unrest, especially the Luddite movement.

===France and continental Europe===
The episode seriously hurt France itself. Shipbuilding, and its trades such as rope-making, declined, as did many other industries that relied on overseas markets, such as the linen industries. With few exports and lost profits, many industries were closed down. Southern France, especially the port cities of Marseille and Bordeaux, as well as the city of La Rochelle, suffered from the reduction in trade. Moreover, the prices of staple foods rose in most of continental Europe.

Napoleon&#x27;s St. Cloud Decree in July 1810 opened the southwest of France and the Spanish frontier to limited British trade, and reopened French trade to the United States. It was an admission that his blockade had hurt his own economy more than the British. It had also failed to reduce British financial support for its allies. The industrialised north and east of France, and Wallonia (the south of present-day Belgium) saw significantly increased profits due to the lack of competition from British goods (particularly textiles, which were produced much more cheaply in Britain).

In Italy, the agricultural sector flourished; but the Dutch economy, predicated on trade, suffered greatly as a result of the embargo. Napoleon&#x27;s economic warfare was much to the chagrin of his own brother, King Louis I of Holland.

===Scandinavia and the Baltic region===
Britain&#x27;s first response to the Continental System was to launch a major naval attack on the weakest link in Napoleon&#x27;s coalition, Denmark. Although ostensibly neutral, Denmark was under heavy French and Russian pressure to pledge its fleet to Napoleon. London could not take the chance of ignoring the Danish threat. In the Second Battle of Copenhagen in August–September 1807, the Royal Navy bombarded Copenhagen, seized the Danish fleet, and assured control of the sea lanes in the North Sea and Baltic Sea for the British merchant fleet. The island of Heligoland off the west coast of Denmark was occupied in September 1807. This base made it easier for Britain to control trade to North Sea ports and to facilitate smuggling. The attacks against Copenhagen and Heligoland started the Gunboat War against Denmark, which lasted until 1814.

Sweden, Britain&#x27;s ally in the Third Coalition, refused to comply with French demands and was attacked by Russia in February and by Denmark-Norway in March 1808. At the same time, a French force threatened to invade southern Sweden, but the plan was stopped as the Royal Navy controlled the Danish straits. The Royal Navy set up a base outside the port of Gothenburg in 1808 to simplify operations into the Baltic Sea. The Baltic campaign was under the command of Vice-admiral James Saumarez. In November 1810 France demanded that Sweden should declare war upon Britain and stop all trade. The result was a phony war between Sweden and Britain. A second navy base was set up on the island of Hanö in the south of Sweden in 1810. These two bases were used to support convoys from Britain to Gothenburg, then through the Danish straits to Hanö. From Hanö the goods were smuggled to the many ports around the Baltic Sea. To further support the convoys, the small Danish island of Anholt was occupied in May 1809. A lighthouse on the island simplified navigation through the Danish straits.

Russia also chafed under the embargo, and in 1810 reopened trade with Britain. Russia&#x27;s withdrawal from the system was a motivating factor behind Napoleon&#x27;s decision to invade Russia in 1812, which proved the turning point of the war and his regime.

===Portugal and Spain===
Portugal openly refused to join the Continental System. In 1793, Portugal signed a treaty of mutual assistance with Britain. After the Treaty of Tilsit in July 1807, Napoleon attempted to capture the Portuguese fleet and the House of Braganza, and to occupy the Portuguese ports. He failed, as Prince-regent John VI, acting for his mother, Queen Maria I of Portugal, took the fleet and transferred the Portuguese court to Brazil with a Royal Navy escort. The Portuguese population rose in revolt against the French invaders, with the help of the British Army under Arthur Wellesley, later the Duke of Wellington. Napoleon intervened, and the Peninsular War began in 1808. Napoleon also forced the Spanish royal family to abdicate their throne in favour of Napoleon&#x27;s brother, Joseph.

<doc id="229020" wikidata="Q274179" url="?curid=229020" title="Egyptian goose">
<text>The Egyptian goose (Alopochen aegyptiaca) is an African member of the Anatidae family including ducks, geese, and swans. Because of their popularity chiefly as an ornamental bird, the species has also been introduced to Europe, the United States and elsewhere outside their natural range. Egyptian geese were regularly represented in ancient Egyptian art.

== Taxonomy ==
The Egyptian goose was formally described in 1766 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the twelfth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Anas aegyptiaca&quot;. Linnaeus partly based his account on the &quot;L&#x27;oye d&#x27;Egypte&quot; that had been described and illustrated in 1760 by the French ornithologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in his &quot;Ornithologie&quot;. Brisson used the Latin name &quot;Anser Egyptiatiacus&quot; but although he coined Latin names for species, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. The Egyptian goose is now placed with the extinct Mauritius sheldgoose and the extinct Reunion sheldgoose in the genus &quot;Alopochen&quot; that was introduced in 1885 by the Norwegian born zoologist Leonhard Stejneger. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. The generic name &quot;Alopochen&quot; (literally, &quot;fox-goose&quot;) is based on Greek (&quot;alōpós&quot;, also &quot;alōpēx&quot;), &quot;fox&quot;, and (&quot;chēn&quot;) &quot;goose&quot;, referring to the ruddy colour of its back. The word χήν : chēn is grammatically of either masculine or feminine gender. The species name &quot;aegyptiacus&quot; (or &quot;aegyptiaca&quot;) is from the Latin &quot;Aegyptiacus&quot;, &quot;Egyptian&quot;.

The Egyptian goose is believed to be most closely related to the shelducks (genus &quot;Tadorna&quot;) and their relatives, and is placed with them in the subfamily Tadorninae. It is the only extant member of the genus &quot;Alopochen&quot;, which also contains closely related prehistoric and recently extinct species. mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; sequence data suggest that the relationships of &quot;Alopochen&quot; to &quot;Tadorna&quot; need further investigation.

== Description ==

It swims well and appears heavy in flight, more like a goose than a duck, hence the English name. On average, they are tall.

The sexes of this species are identical in plumage but the males are usually somewhat larger. They vary greatly in plumage tone, with some birds greyer and others browner, but this variation has not been observed to be sex- or age-related. A large part of the wings of mature birds is white, but the white is hidden by the wing coverts when at rest. When it is aroused, either in alarm or aggression, the white is displayed.

Egyptian geese in the wild can live for up to 15 years, while captive individuals have been recorded reaching an age of 35.

The voices and vocalisations of the sexes differ, the male having a hoarse, subdued duck-like quack which seldom sounds unless it is aroused, as well as a louder, breathy call which is performed in a rapid sequence, sounding somewhat like a steam engine. The female has a far noisier raucous quack that frequently sounds in aggression when tending her young. The male Egyptian goose attracts its mate with an elaborate, noisy courtship display that includes honking, neck stretching and feather displays.

== Distribution ==
The Egyptian goose is native to Sub-Saharan Africa and the Nile Valley, where it is widespread and common to abundant, though it has become scarce in the northern Nile Valley. It is found in open or semi-open habitats, typically near fresh water, ranging from lowlands to above sea level in the Ethiopian Highlands, and largely absent from dense forests and deserts. While not breeding, it disperses somewhat, sometimes making longer migrations northwards into the arid regions of the Sahel, and occasionally even reaching the North African nations of Algeria and Tunisia, historically a more frequent part of its range.

It was found in southeastern Europe (up to the lower Danube Valley and southern Hungary) until the early 1700s, and in parts of Turkey and the western Middle East until the early 1900s (and has since re-established through escaped captives), but its historical ranges in these places is incompletely known and the reason for the disappearances is also unknown.

===Introduced populations===
====United Kingdom====
The British populations of the Egyptian goose date back to the 17th century when it was introduced to estates and parks, though the species was only formally added to the British bird list in 1971. The British introductions were the first outside its native range; however, these individuals did not spread widely and are not known to have expanded into other countries. In Great Britain, it is found mainly in East Anglia, and in various locations along the River Thames, where it breeds at sites with open water, short grass and suitable nesting locations (either islands, holes in old trees or amongst epicormic shoots on old trees). During the winter, they are widely dispersed within river valleys, where they feed on short grass and cereals. In the United Kingdom in 2009, it was officially declared a non-native species. Accordingly, Egyptian geese in Great Britain may be shot without special permission if they cause problems.

====Mainland Europe====
The Egyptian goose was first introduced to the Netherlands in 1967 and to Belgium in 1982, and these formed the basis for the population in mainland Europe, likely supplemented by some captive escapees from other European countries. From these two countries, the species has experienced a relatively fast range expansion into adjacent countries, first spreading into Germany and France (where possibly supplemented by local escapees) in the mid-1980s, and then to the Czech Republic, Denmark, Luxembourg and Switzerland in the early 2000s. Further observations, sometimes also involving isolated cases of breeding, have been made in Austria, Italy, Poland, Spain, Sweden and elsewhere in mainland Europe, but it is not yet known to have become established in those countries.

Because of its aggressiveness towards other birds, it may reduce or displace native species, and since 2017 the Egyptian goose has been listed as an invasive species in the European Union. Therefore this species cannot be imported, bred, transported, commercialized, used, exchanged or intentionally released into the environment and member states are obliged to try to eradicate the species.

====Elsewhere====
In addition to Europe, the Egyptian goose has been introduced and established breeding populations in Mauritius, Israel, the United Arab Emirates and the United States. In the US, breeding populations are found in Arkansas, California, Florida, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Texas, with occasional reports of the species elsewhere. Although the Egyptian goose was introduced to Australia and New Zealand, it did not become established in these countries.

== Behaviour ==
This is a largely terrestrial species, which will also perch on trees and buildings. 

This species will nest in a large variety of situations, especially in holes in mature trees in parkland. The female builds the nest from reeds, leaves and grass and both parents take turns incubating the eggs. Egyptian geese usually mate for life. Both the male and female care for the offspring until they are old enough to care for themselves. Such parental care, however, does not include foraging for the young, which are able to forage for themselves upon hatching.

Egyptian geese typically eat seeds, leaves, grasses and plant stems. Occasionally, they will eat locusts, worms, or other small animals. Until the goslings are a few weeks old and strong enough to graze, they feed largely on small aquatic invertebrates, especially freshwater plankton. As a result, if anoxic conditions lead to the production of botulinum toxin and it gets passed up the food chain via worms and insect larvae insensitive to the toxin, entire clutches of goslings feeding on such prey may die. The parents, who do not eat such organisms to any significant extent, generally remain unaffected.

Both sexes are aggressively territorial towards their own species when breeding and frequently pursue intruders into the air, attacking them in aerial &quot;dogfights&quot;. Egyptian geese have been observed attacking aerial objects such as drones that enter their habitat as well. Neighbouring pairs may even kill another&#x27;s offspring for their own offsprings&#x27; survival, as well as for more resources.

In their native range, predators of Egyptian geese include leopards, lions, cheetahs, hyenas, crocodiles and Old World vultures.

<text>Cyprinus is the genus of typical carps in family Cyprinidae. Most species in the genus are of East Asia origin with only the common carp (&quot;C. carpio&quot;) in Western Asia and Europe; this invasive species has also been introduced to many other regions around the world. &quot;Cyprinus&quot; are closely related to some more barb-like genera, such as &quot;Cyclocheilichthys&quot; and &quot;Barbonymus&quot; (tinfoils). The crucian carps (&quot;Carassius&quot;) of western Eurasia, which include the goldfish (&quot;C. auratus&quot;), are apparently not as closely related.

This genus&#x27;s most widespread and well-known member is the common carp (&quot;C. carpio&quot;) species complex. Although traditionally considered a single species, recent authorities have split the European and West Asian populations from the East Asian, with the latter named &quot;C. rubrofuscus&quot; (syn. &quot;C. carpio haematopterus&quot;). Members of the species complex are famed as a food fish and have been widely traded and introduced since antiquity, but in certain areas has multiplied inordinately and become a pest. In its long use it has been domesticated, and a number of breeds have been developed for food and other purposes. The koi (from Japanese &quot;nishikigoi&quot;, 錦鯉) are well-known carp breeds, selectively bred for being enjoyed by spectators from above. Strictly speaking, &quot;koi&quot; is simply the Japanese name of the East Asian carp.

The other species of typical carp are generally found in more restricted areas of eastern Asia, centered on the Yunnan region. In some cases, they are endemic to a single lake, most notably Lake Erhai, as well as Lake Dian, Fuxian Lake, Lake Jilu, Lake Qilihu, Lake Xingyun and Lake Yi-Lung, which are all in Yunnan proper. Several of these species are seriously threatened and five are possibly already extinct: &quot;C. yilongensis&quot; (Lake Yi-Lung), &quot;C. yunnanensis&quot; (Lake Qilihu), &quot;C. daliensis&quot; (Lake Erhai), &quot;C. megalophthalmus&quot; (Lake Erhai) and &quot;C. fuxianensis&quot; (Fuxian Lake).

<text>George Glenn Jones (September 12, 1931 – April 26, 2013) was an American country musician, singer, and songwriter. He achieved international fame for a long list of hit records, and is well known for his distinctive voice and phrasing. For the last two decades of his life, Jones was frequently referred to as &quot;the greatest living country singer&quot;, &quot;The Rolls-Royce of Country Music&quot;, and had more than 160 chart singles to his name from 1955 until his death in 2013.

His earliest musical influences were Roy Acuff and Bill Monroe, although the artistry of Hank Williams and Lefty Frizzell helped to crystallize his vocal style. He served in the United States Marine Corps and was discharged in 1953. In 1959, Jones recorded &quot;White Lightning&quot;, written by The Big Bopper, which launched his career as a singer. Years of alcoholism compromised his health and led to his missing many performances, earning him the nickname &quot;No Show Jones.&quot; Jones died in 2013, aged 81, from hypoxic respiratory failure.

==Life and career==

===Early years (1931–1953)===

George Glenn Jones was born on September 12, 1931, in Saratoga, Texas, and was raised with a brother and five sisters in Colmesneil, Texas, in the Big Thicket region of southeast Texas. His father, George Washington Jones, worked in a shipyard and played harmonica and guitar; his mother, Clara (née Patterson), played piano in the Pentecostal Church on Sundays. When Jones was born, one of the doctors dropped him and broke his arm. He heard country music for the first time when he was seven, when his parents bought a radio. Jones recalled to &quot;Billboard&quot; in 2006 that he would lie in bed with his parents on Saturday nights listening to the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;, and would insist that his mother wake him if he fell asleep so that he could hear Roy Acuff or Bill Monroe.

In his autobiography &quot;I Lived To Tell It All&quot;, Jones recalled that the early death of his sister Ethel worsened his father&#x27;s drinking problem, which caused him to be physically and emotionally abusive to his wife and children. In his biography &quot;George Jones: The Life and Times of a Honky Tonk Legend&quot;, Bob Allen recounts how George Washington Jones would return home drunk in the middle of the night with his cronies, wake up his terrified son and demand that he sing for them or face a beating. In a CMT episode of &quot;Inside Fame&quot; dedicated to Jones&#x27;s life, country music historian Robert K. Oermann said, &quot;You would think that it would make him not a singer, because it was so abusively thrust on him. But the opposite happened; he became ... someone who had to sing.&quot; In the same program, Jones admitted that he remained ambivalent and resentful towards his father until the day he died. He observed in his autobiography, &quot;The Jones family makeup doesn&#x27;t sit well with liquor ... Daddy was an unusual drinker. He drank to excess, but never while working, and he probably was the hardest working man I&#x27;ve ever known.&quot; His father bought him his first guitar at age nine and he learned his first chords and songs at church. Several photographs show a young George busking on the streets of Beaumont.
He left home at 16 and went to Jasper, Texas, where he sang and played on the KTXJ radio station with fellow musician Dalton Henderson. He moved to the KRIC radio station, and during an afternoon show there met his idol, Hank Williams (&quot;I just stared,&quot; he later wrote). In the 1989 video documentary &quot;Same Ole Me&quot;, Jones admitted, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t think or eat nothin&#x27; unless it was Hank Williams, and I couldn&#x27;t wait for his next record to come out. He had to be, really, the greatest.&quot; He married his first wife Dorothy Bonvillion in 1950; they divorced in 1951. He was enlisted in the United States Marines and until his discharge in 1953 was stationed in San Jose, California.

===First recordings (1954–1957)===

Jones married Shirley Ann Corley in 1954. His first record, the self-penned &quot;No Money in This Deal&quot;, was recorded on January 19 and was released in February on Starday Records. This began Jones&#x27;s association with producer and mentor H.W. &quot;Pappy&quot; Daily. The song was cut in the living room of Starday Records&#x27; co-founder Jack Starnes, who produced it. Around this time Jones also worked at KTRM (now KZZB) in Beaumont. Deejay Gordon Baxter told Nick Tosches that Jones had acquired the nickname &quot;possum&quot; while working there. During his early recording sessions, Daily admonished Jones for attempting to sound too much like his heroes Hank Williams and Lefty Frizzell. In 1996 Jones recalled to NPR that the quality of production at Starday was poor. &quot;It was a terrible sound. We recorded in a small living room of a house on a highway near Beaumont. You could hear the trucks. We had to stop a lot of times because it wasn&#x27;t soundproof, it was just egg crates nailed on the wall and the big old semi trucks would go by and make a lot of noise and we&#x27;d have to start over again.&quot; Jones&#x27;s first hit came with &quot;Why Baby Why&quot; in 1955, and in that year, while touring as a cast member of the &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot;, Jones met and played shows with Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash. In 1994, Jones told Nick Tosches that Presley &quot;stayed pretty much with his friends around him in his dressing room&quot;. Jones remained a lifelong friend of Johnny Cash, and was invited to sing at the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; in 1956.

With Presley&#x27;s explosion in popularity in 1956, pressure was put on Jones to cut some rockabilly sides. He reluctantly agreed, but his heart was not in it and he quickly regretted his decision. He joked later in his autobiography, &quot;When I&#x27;ve encountered those records I&#x27;ve used them for Frisbees.&quot; He told &quot;Billboard&quot; in 2006: &quot;I was desperate. When you&#x27;re hungry, a poor man with a house full of kids, you&#x27;re gonna do some things you ordinarily wouldn&#x27;t do. I said, &#x27;Well, hell, I&#x27;ll try anything once.&#x27; I tried &#x27;Dadgum It How Come It&#x27; and &#x27;Rock It&#x27;, a bunch of shit. I didn&#x27;t want my name on the rock and roll thing, so I told them to put Thumper Jones on it and if it did something, good, if it didn&#x27;t, hell, I didn&#x27;t want to be shamed with it.&quot; He unsuccessfully attempted to buy all the masters to keep the cuts from surfacing later, which they did.

Jones moved to Mercury in 1957, teamed up with singer Jeannette Hicks, the first of several duet partners he would have over the years, and had another top-10 single with &quot;Yearning&quot;. Starday Records merged with Mercury that year, and Jones was rated highly on the charts with his debut Mercury release, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop the Music&quot;. Although he was garnering a lot of attention, and his singles were making very respectable showings on the charts, he was still travelling the black-top roads in a 1940s Packard with his name and phone number on the side, playing the &quot;blood bucket&quot; circuit of honky-tonks that dotted the rural countryside.

===Commercial breakout (1959–1964)===
In 1959, Jones had his first number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart with &quot;White Lightnin&#x27;&quot;, which was a more authentic rock and roll sound than his half-hearted rockabilly cuts.

Jones had early success as a songwriter. He wrote or co-wrote many of his biggest hits during this period, several of which became standards, such as &quot;Window Up Above&quot; (later a hit for Mickey Gilley in 1975) and &quot;Seasons of My Heart&quot; (a hit for Johnny Cash, and also recorded by Willie Nelson and Jerry Lee Lewis). Jones wrote &quot;Just One More&quot; (also recorded by Cash), &quot;Life To Go&quot; (a top-five hit for Stonewall Jackson in 1959), &quot;You Gotta Be My Baby&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop The Music&quot; on his own, and had a hand in writing &quot;Color of the Blues&quot; (covered by Loretta Lynn and Elvis Costello), &quot;Tender Years&quot;, and &quot;Tall, Tall Trees&quot; (co-written with Roger Miller). Jones&#x27;s most frequent songwriting collaborator was his childhood friend Darrell Edwards.

Jones signed with United Artists in 1962, and immediately scored one of the biggest hits of his career, &quot;She Thinks I Still Care&quot;. His voice had grown deeper during this period, and he began cultivating his own singing style. During his stint with UA, Jones recorded albums of Hank Williams and Bob Wills songs, and cut an album of duets with Melba Montgomery, including the hit &quot;We Must Have Been Out of Our Minds&quot;. Jones was also gaining a reputation as a hell-raiser. In his &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; tribute, Merle Haggard recalled:

:&quot;I met him at the Blackboard Café in Bakersfield, California, which was the place to go in &#x27;61. He was already famous for not showing up or showing up drunk, and he showed up drunk. I was onstage – I think I was singing Marty Robbins&#x27; &#x27;Devil Woman&#x27; – and he kicked the doors of the office open and said &#x27;Who the fuck is that?&#x27; It was one of the greatest compliments of my entire life when George Jones said I was his favorite country singer ... In 1967, I released a ballad called &quot;I Threw Away The Rose&quot; and he was so impressed he actually jumped ship and left his tour, rented a Lear Jet and came to Amarillo, Texas. He told me my low note changed his life. &quot;

Jones was always backed by the Jones Boys on tour. Like Buck Owens&#x27;s Buckaroos and Merle Haggard&#x27;s Strangers, Jones worked with many talented musicians, including Dan Schafer, Hank Singer, Brittany Allyn, Sonny Curtis, Kent Goodson, Bobby Birkhead, and Steve Hinson. In the 1980s and 1990s, bass player Ron Gaddis served as the Jones Boys&#x27; bandleader and sang harmony with Jones in concert. Lorrie Morgan (who married Gaddis) also toured as a backup singer for Jones in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Johnny Paycheck was the Jones Boys&#x27; bass player in the 1960s before going on to his own stardom in the 1970s.

===Alcoholism and decline (1964–1979) ===

In 1964, Pappy Daily secured a new contract with Musicor records. For the rest of the 1960s, Jones scored only one number one (1967&#x27;s &quot;Walk Through This World With Me&quot;), but he featured often in the country music charts. Significant hits included &quot;Love Bug&quot; (a nod to Buck Owens and the Bakersfield sound), &quot;Things Have Gone to Pieces&quot;, &quot;The Race Is On&quot;, &quot;My Favorite Lies&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Share My World with You&quot;, &quot;Take Me&quot; (which he co-wrote and later recorded with Tammy Wynette), &quot;A Good Year for the Roses&quot;, and &quot;If My Heart Had Windows&quot;. Jones&#x27;s singing style had by now evolved from the full-throated, high lonesome sound of Hank Williams and Roy Acuff on his early Starday records to the more refined, subtle style of Lefty Frizzell. In a 2006 interview with &quot;Billboard&quot;, Jones acknowledged the fellow Texan&#x27;s influence on his idiosyncratic phrasing: &quot;I got that from Lefty. He always made five syllables out of one word.&quot;

Jones&#x27;s binge drinking and use of amphetamines on the road caught up to him in 1967, and he had to be admitted into a neurological hospital to seek treatment for his drinking. Jones would go to extreme lengths for a drink if the thirst was on him. A drinking story concerning Jones occurred while he was married to his second wife Shirley Corley. Jones recalled Shirley trying to prevent him from travelling to Beaumont, away, to buy liquor. She said she hid the keys to all their cars, but she did not hide the keys to the lawn mower. He wrote in his memoir: &quot;There, gleaming in the glow, was that ten-horsepower rotary engine under a seat. A key glistening in the ignition. I imagine the top speed for that old mower was five miles per hour. It might have taken an hour and a half or more for me to get to the liquor store, but get there I did.&quot; Years later Jones comically mocked the incident by making a cameo in the video for &quot;All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight&quot; by Hank Williams Jr. He also parodied the episode in the 1993 video for &quot;One More Last Chance&quot; by Vince Gill and in his own music video for the single &quot;Honky Tonk Song&quot; in 1996. Tammy Wynette, in her 1979 autobiography &quot;Stand By Your Man&quot;, claimed the incident occurred while she was married to Jones. She said she woke at one in the morning to find her husband gone. &quot;I got into the car and drove to the nearest bar 10 miles [16 km] away. When I pulled into the parking lot, there sat our rider-mower right by the entrance. He&#x27;d driven that mower right down a main highway... He looked up and saw me and said, ‘Well, fellas, here she is now. My little wife, I told you she&#x27;d come after me.’&quot; Jones had become aware of Tammy Wynette because their tours were booked by the same agency and their paths sometimes crossed. Wynette was married to songwriter Don Chapel, who was also the opening act for her shows, and the three became friends. Jones married Wynette in 1969.
They began touring together, and Jones bought out his contract with Musicor so that he could record with Wynette and her producer Billy Sherrill on Epic Records after she had split with longtime producer Pappy Daily. In the early 1970s, Jones and Wynette became known as &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Country Music&quot; and scored several big hits, including &quot;We&#x27;re Gonna Hold On&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Build A World Together&quot;, &quot;Golden Ring&quot; and &quot;Near You&quot;. When asked about recording Jones and Wynette, Sherill told Dan Daley in 2002, &quot;We started out trying to record the vocals together, but George drove Tammy crazy with his phrasing. He never, ever did it the same way twice. He could make a five-syllable word out of &#x27;church.&#x27; Finally, Tammy said, &#x27;Record George and let me listen to it, and then do my vocal after we get his on tape.&#x27; &quot;

In October 1970, shortly after the birth of their only child Tamala Georgette, Jones was straitjacketed and committed to a padded cell at the Watson Clinic in Lakeland, Florida, after a drunken bender. He was kept there for 10 days to detoxify, before being released with a prescription for Librium. Jones managed to stay sober with Wynette for long periods, but as the decade wore on, his drinking and erratic behavior worsened and they divorced in 1976. Jones accepted responsibility for the failure of the marriage, but denied Wynette&#x27;s allegations in her autobiography that he had beaten her and fired a shotgun at her. Jones and Wynette continued playing shows and drawing crowds after their divorce, as fans began to see their songs mirroring their stormy relationship. In 1980, they recorded the album &quot;Together Again&quot; and scored a hit with &quot;Two Story House&quot;. In the 2019 Ken Burns documentary &quot;Country Music,&quot; Jones and Wynette were compared to &quot;two wounded animals&quot;. Jones also spoke of his hopes for a reconciliation, and would jokingly reference Wynette in some of his songs – during performances of his 1981 hit &quot;If Drinkin&#x27; Don&#x27;t Kill Me (Her Memory Will)&quot; he would sing &quot;Tammy&#x27;s memory will&quot; – but the recriminations continued. Jones and Wynette appeared to make peace in the 1990s, and recorded a final album, &quot;One&quot;, and toured together again before Wynette&#x27;s death in 1998. In 1995, Jones told &quot;Country Weekly&quot;, &quot;Like the old saying goes, it takes time to heal things and they&#x27;ve been healed quite a while.&quot;

Jones&#x27;s pairing with Billy Sherrill at Epic Records came as a surprise to many; Sherrill and business partner Glenn Sutton are regarded as the defining influences of the countrypolitan sound, a smooth amalgamation of pop and country music that was popular during the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, a far cry from George&#x27;s honky-tonk roots. Despite a shaky start, the success that Sherrill had with Jones proved to be his most enduring; although &quot;Billboard&quot; chart statistics show that Sherrill had his biggest commercial successes with artists such as Wynette and Charlie Rich, with Jones, Sherrill had his longest-lasting association. In Sherrill, Jones found what Andrew Meuller of &quot;Uncut&quot; described as &quot;the producer capable of creating the epically lachrymose arrangements his voice deserved and his torment demanded...He summoned for Jones the symphonies of sighing strings that almost made the misery of albums like 1974&#x27;s &quot;The Grand Tour&quot; and 1976&#x27;s &quot;Alone Again&quot; sound better than happiness could possibly feel.&quot; In 1974, they scored a number-one hit with the instant classic &quot;The Grand Tour&quot; and followed that with &quot;The Door&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;ve heard the sound of my dear old mother cryin&#x27;/and the sound of the train that took me off to war&quot;), another number-one smash. Unlike most singers, who might have been overwhelmed by the string arrangements and background vocalists Sherrill sometimes employed on his records, Jones&#x27;s voice, with its at times frightening intensity and lucid tone, could stand up to anything. While Jones wrote fewer songs himself – songwriters had been tripping over themselves pitching songs to him for years – he still managed to co-write several, such as &quot;What My Woman Can&#x27;t Do&quot; (also recorded by Jerry Lee Lewis), &quot;A Drunk Can&#x27;t Be A Man&quot;, the harrowing &quot;I Just Don&#x27;t Give a Damn&quot; (perhaps the greatest &quot;lost classic&quot; in the entire Jones catalogue), and &quot;These Days (I Barely Get By)&quot;, which he had written with Wynette.

In the late 1970s, Jones spiraled out of control. Already drinking constantly, a manager named Shug Baggot introduced him to cocaine before a show because he was too tired to perform. The drug increased Jones&#x27;s already considerable paranoia. During one drunken binge, he shot at, and very nearly hit, his friend and occasional songwriting partner Earl &quot;Peanutt&quot; Montgomery after Montgomery had quit drinking after finding religion. He was often penniless and acknowledged in his autobiography that Waylon Jennings and Johnny Cash came to his financial aid during this time. Jones also began missing shows at an alarming rate and lawsuits from promoters started piling up. In 1978, owing Wynette $36,000 in child support and claiming to be $1 million in debt, he filed for bankruptcy. Jones appeared incoherent at times, speaking in quarrelling voices that he would later call &quot;the Duck&quot; and &quot;the Old Man&quot;. In his article &quot;The Devil In George Jones&quot;, Nick Tosches states, &quot;By February 1979, he was homeless, deranged, and destitute, living in his car and barely able to digest the junk food on which he subsisted. He weighed under a hundred pounds, and his condition was so bad that it took him more than two years to complete &quot;My Very Special Guests&quot;, an album on which Willie Nelson, Linda Ronstadt, Elvis Costello, and other famous fans came to his vocal aid and support. Jones entered Hillcrest Psychiatric Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama. Upon his release in January 1980, the first thing he did was pick up a six-pack.&quot;

Jones often displayed a sheepish, self-deprecating sense of humor regarding his dire financial standing and bad reputation. In June 1979, he appeared with Waylon Jennings on Ralph Emery&#x27;s syndicated radio program, and at one point Jennings cracked, &quot;It&#x27;s lonely at the top.&quot; A laughing Jones replied, &quot;It&#x27;s lonely at the bottom, too! It&#x27;s real, real lonely, Waylon.&quot; Despite his chronic unreliability, Jones was still capable of putting on a captivating live show. On Independence Day, 1976, he appeared at Willie Nelson&#x27;s Fourth of July Picnic in Gonzales, Texas, in front of 80,000 younger, country-rock oriented fans. A nervous Jones felt out of his comfort zone and nearly bolted from the festival, but went on anyway and wound up stealing the show. &quot;The Houston Post&quot; wrote, &quot;He was the undisputed star of this year&#x27;s Willie Nelson picnic...one of the greatest.&quot; &quot;Penthouse&quot; called him &quot;the spirit of country music, plain and simple, its Holy Ghost&quot;. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; added, &quot;As a singer he is as intelligent as they come, and should be considered for a spot in America&#x27;s all-time top ten.&quot; Jones began missing more shows than he made, however, including several highly publicized dates at the Bottom Line club in New York City. Former vice president of CBS Records Rick Blackburn recalls in the 1989 video &quot;Same Ole Me&quot; that the event had been hyped for weeks, with a lot of top press and cast members from &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; planning to attend. &quot;We&#x27;d made our plans, travel arrangements, and so forth. George excused himself from my office, left – and we didn&#x27;t see him for three weeks. He just &quot;did not show up&quot;.&quot; Much like Hank Williams, Jones seemed suspicious of success and furiously despised perceived slights and condescension directed towards the music that he loved so dearly. When he finally played the Bottom Line in 1980, the &quot;New York Times&quot; called him &quot;the finest, most riveting singer in country music&quot;.

===Comeback (1980–1990)===

By 1980, George Jones had not achieved a number-one single in six years, leading many critics to doubt his career. However, he surprised the music industry when &quot;He Stopped Loving Her Today&quot; reached number one on the country charts, staying there for 18 weeks. The song, written by Bobby Braddock and Curly Putman, tells the story of a man who continues to love his departed lover until his death. Jones&#x27;s poignant delivery of the song has made it one of the greatest country songs of all time. Jones&#x27;s interpretation, buoyed by his delivery of the line &quot;first time I&#x27;d seen him smile in years,&quot; gives it a mournful, gripping realism. It is consistently voted as one of the greatest country songs of all time, along with &quot;I&#x27;m So Lonesome I Could Cry&quot; by Hank Williams and &quot;Crazy&quot; by Patsy Cline. Jones, who personally hated the song and considered it morbid, ultimately gave the song credit for reviving his flagging career, stating, &quot;a four-decade career had been salvaged by a three-minute song&quot;. Jones earned the Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance in 1980. The Academy of Country Music awarded the song Single of the Year and Song of the Year in 1980. It also became the Country Music Association&#x27;s Song of the Year in both 1980 and 1981.

The success of &quot;He Stopped Loving Her Today&quot; led CBS Records to renew Jones&#x27;s recording contract and sparked new interest in the singer. He was the subject of an hour-and-a-quarter-long HBO television special entitled &quot;George Jones: With a Little Help from His Friends&quot;, which had him performing songs with Waylon Jennings, Elvis Costello, Tanya Tucker, and Tammy Wynette, among others. Jones continued drinking and using cocaine, appearing at various awards shows to accept honors for &quot;He Stopped Loving Her Today&quot; obviously inebriated, like when he performed &quot;I Was Country When Country Wasn&#x27;t Cool&quot; with Barbara Mandrell at the 1981 Country Music Association Awards. He was involved in several high-speed car chases with police, which were reported on the national news, and one arrest was filmed by a local TV crew; the video, which is widely available online, offers a glimpse into Jones&#x27;s alter ego when drinking, as he argues with the police officer and lunges at the camera man. Conversely, when sober, Jones was known to be friendly and down to earth, even shy. In a 1994 article on Jones, Nick Tosches remarked that when he first interviewed the singer in April 1976, &quot;One could readily believe the accounts by those who had known him for years: that he had not changed much at all and that he had been impervious to fame and fortune.&quot; In an unusually unguarded self-appraisal in 1981, the singer told Mark Rose of &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, &quot;I don&#x27;t show a lot of affection. I have probably been a very unliked person among family, like somebody who was heartless. I saved it all for the songs. I didn&#x27;t know you were supposed to show that love person to person. I guess I always wanted to, but I didn&#x27;t know how. The only way I could would be to do it in a song.&quot; Years later he commented to the Christian Broadcasting Network&#x27;s Scott Ross about himself, &quot;I think you&#x27;re mad at yourself, I think that you&#x27;re sayin&#x27; to yourself &#x27;You don&#x27;t deserve this. You don&#x27;t deserve those fans. You don&#x27;t deserve makin&#x27; this money.&#x27; And you&#x27;re mad at yourself. And you beat up on yourself by drinkin&#x27; and losing friends that won&#x27;t put up with that...It&#x27;s just one terrible big mess you make out of your life.&quot; In 1982, Jones recorded the album &quot;A Taste of Yesterday&#x27;s Wine&quot; with Merle Haggard; while Jones, in the wake of his condition, appeared underweight on the album cover, his singing was flawless. His run of hits also continued in the early 1980s, with the singer charting &quot;I&#x27;m Not Ready Yet&quot;, &quot;Same Ole Me&quot; (backed by the Oak Ridge Boys)&quot;, &quot;Still Doin&#x27; Time&quot;, &quot;Tennessee Whiskey&quot;, &quot;We Didn&#x27;t See a Thing&quot; (a duet with Ray Charles), and &quot;I Always Get Lucky with You&quot;, which was Jones&#x27;s last number one in 1984.

In 1981, Jones met Nancy Sepulvado, a 34-year-old divorcée from Mansfield, Louisiana. Sepulvado&#x27;s positive impact on Jones&#x27;s life and career cannot be overstated. She eventually cleaned up his finances, kept him away from his drug dealers (who reportedly kidnapped her daughter in retaliation), and managed his career. Jones always gave her complete credit for saving his life. Nancy, who did not drink, explained to Nick Tosches in 1994, &quot;He was drinking but he was fun to be around. It wasn&#x27;t love at first sight or anything like that. But I saw what a good person he was, deep down, and I couldn&#x27;t help caring about him.&quot; Jones managed to quit cocaine, but went on a drunken rampage in Alabama in fall 1983, and was once again straitjacketed and committed to Hillcrest Psychiatric Hospital suffering from malnutrition and delusions. By that time, though, physically and emotionally exhausted, he really did want to quit drinking. In March 1984 in Birmingham, Alabama – at the age of 52 – Jones performed his first sober show since the early &#x27;70s. &quot;All my life it seems like I&#x27;ve been running from something,&quot; he told the United Press International in June. &quot;If I knew what it was, maybe I could run in the right direction, but I always seem to end up going the other way.&quot; Jones began making up many of the dates he had missed, playing them for free to pay back promoters, and began opening his concerts with &quot;No Show Jones&quot;, a song he had written with Glen Martin that poked fun at himself and other country singers. Jones always stressed that he was not proud of the way he treated loved ones and friends over the years, and was ashamed of disappointing his fans when he missed shows, telling &quot;Billboard&quot; in 2006, &quot;I know it hurt my fans in a way and I&#x27;ve always been sad about that, it really bothered me for a long time.&quot;

Mostly sober for the rest of the 1980s, Jones consistently released albums with Sherrill producing, including &quot;Shine On&quot;, &quot;Jones Country&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ve Still Got A Place In My Heart&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s Gonna Fill Their Shoes&quot;, &quot;Wine Colored Roses&quot; (an album Jones would tell Jolene Downs in 2001 was one of his personal favorites), &quot;Too Wild Too Long&quot;, and &quot;One Woman Man&quot;. Jones&#x27;s video for his 1985 hit &quot;Who&#x27;s Gonna Fill Their Shoes&quot; won the CMA award for Video of the Year (Billy Sherrill makes a cameo as the bus driver).

===Later years and death (1990–2013)===

In 1990, Jones released his last proper studio album on Epic, &quot;You Oughta Be Here With Me&quot;. Although the album featured several stirring performances, including the lead single &quot;Hell Stays Open All Night Long&quot; and the Roger Miller-penned title song, the single did poorly and Jones made the switch to MCA, ending his relationship with Sherrill and what was now Sony Music after 19 years. His first album with MCA, &quot;And Along Came Jones&quot;, was released in 1991, and backed by MCA&#x27;s powerful promotion team and producer Kyle Lehning (who had produced a string of hit albums for Randy Travis), the album sold better than his previous one had. However, two singles, &quot;You Couldn&#x27;t Get The Picture&quot; and &quot;She Loved A Lot In Her Time&quot; (a tribute to Jones&#x27;s mother Clara), did not crack the top 30 on the charts, as Jones lost favor with country radio, as the format was altered radically during the early 1990s. His last album to have significant radio airplay was 1992&#x27;s &quot;Walls Can Fall&quot;, which featured the novelty song &quot;Finally Friday&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Need Your Rockin&#x27; Chair&quot;, a testament to his continued vivaciousness in his sixties. Despite the lack of radio airplay, Jones continued to record and tour throughout the 1990s and was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame by Randy Travis in 1992. In 1996, Jones released his autobiography &quot;I Lived To Tell It All&quot; with Tom Carter, and the irony of his long career was not lost on him, with the singer writing in its preface, &quot;I also know that a lot of my show-business peers are going to be angry after reading this book. So many have worked so hard to maintain their careers. I never took my career seriously, and yet it&#x27;s flourishing.&quot; He also pulled no punches about his disappointment in the direction country music had taken, devoting a full chapter to the changes in the country music scene of the 1990s that had him removed from radio playlists in favor of a younger generation of pop-influenced country stars. (Jones had long been a critic of country pop, and along with Wynette and Jean Shepard, he was one of the major backers of the Association of Country Entertainers, a guild promoting traditional country sounds that was founded in 1974; Jones&#x27;s divorce from Wynette was a factor in the association&#x27;s collapse.) Despite his absence from the country charts during this time, latter-day country superstars such as Garth Brooks, Randy Travis, Alan Jackson, and many others often paid tribute to Jones, while expressing their love and respect for his legacy as a true country legend who paved the way for their own success. On February 17, 1998, The Nashville Network premiered a group of television specials called &quot;The George Jones Show&quot;, with Jones as host. The program featured informal chats with Jones holding court with country&#x27;s biggest stars old and new, and of course, music. Guests included Loretta Lynn, Trace Adkins, Johnny Paycheck, Lorrie Morgan, Merle Haggard, Billy Ray Cyrus, Tim McGraw, Faith Hill, Charley Pride, Bobby Bare, Patty Loveless, and Waylon Jennings, among others.

While Jones remained committed to &quot;pure country&quot;, he worked with the top producers and musicians of the day and the quality of his work remained high. Some of his significant performances include &quot;I Must Have Done Something Bad&quot;, &quot;Wild Irish Rose&quot;, &quot;Billy B. Bad&quot; (a sarcastic jab at country music establishment trendsetters), &quot;A Thousand Times A Day&quot;, &quot;When The Last Curtain Falls&quot;, and the novelty &quot;High-Tech Redneck&quot;. Jones&#x27;s most popular song in his later years was &quot;Choices&quot;, the first single from his 1999 studio album &quot;Cold Hard Truth&quot;. A video was also made for the song, and Jones won another Grammy for Best Male Country Vocal Performance. The song was at the center of controversy when the Country Music Association invited Jones to perform it on the awards show, but required that he perform an abridged version. Jones refused and did not attend the show. Alan Jackson was disappointed with the association&#x27;s decision, and halfway through his own performance during the show, he signaled to his band and played part of Jones&#x27;s song in protest.

On March 6, 1999, Jones was involved in an accident when he crashed his sport utility vehicle near his home. He was taken to the Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), where he was released two weeks later. In May of that year, Jones pleaded guilty to drunk-driving charges related to the accident. (In his memoir published three years earlier, Jones admitted that he sometimes had a glass of wine before dinner and that he still drank beer occasionally, but insisted, &quot;I don&#x27;t squirm in my seat, fighting the urge for another drink&quot; and speculated, &quot;perhaps I&#x27;m not a true alcoholic in the modern sense of the word. Perhaps I was always just an old fashioned drunk.&quot;) 
The crash was a significant turning point, as he explained to &quot;Billboard&quot; in 2006: &quot;when I had that wreck, I made up my mind, it put the fear of God in me. No more smoking, no more drinking. I didn&#x27;t have to have no help, I made up my mind to quit. I don&#x27;t crave it.&quot; After the accident, Jones went on to release &quot;The Gospel Collection&quot; in 2003, for which Billy Sherrill came out of retirement to produce. He appeared at a televised Johnny Cash Memorial Concert in Jonesboro, Arkansas, in 2003, singing &quot;Big River&quot; with Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson. In 2008, Jones received the Kennedy Center Honor along with Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey of The Who, Barbra Streisand, Morgan Freeman, and Twyla Tharp. President George W. Bush disclosed that he had many of Jones&#x27;s songs on his iPod. Jones also served as judge in 2008 for the 8th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists&#x27; careers. An album titled &quot;Hits I Missed and One I Didn&#x27;t&quot;, in which he covered hits he had passed on, as well as a remake of his own &quot;He Stopped Loving Her Today&quot;, would be released as his final studio album. In 2012, Jones received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement award.

On March 29, 2012, Jones was taken to the hospital with an upper respiratory infection. Months later, on May 21, Jones was hospitalized again for his infection and was released five days later. On August 14, 2012, Jones announced his farewell tour, the Grand Tour, with scheduled stops at 60 cities. His final concert was held in Knoxville at the Knoxville Civic Coliseum on April 6, 2013.
Jones was scheduled to perform his final concert at the Bridgestone Arena on November 22, 2013. However, on April 18, 2013, Jones was taken to VUMC for a slight fever and irregular blood pressure. His concerts in Alabama and Salem were postponed as a result. Following six days in intensive care at VUMC, Jones died on April 26, 2013, at age 81. Former First Lady Laura Bush was among those eulogizing Jones at his funeral on May 2, 2013. Other speakers were Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, news personality Bob Schieffer, and country singers Barbara Mandrell and Kenny Chesney. Alan Jackson, Kid Rock, Ronnie Milsap, Randy Travis, Vince Gill, Patty Loveless, Travis Tritt, the Oak Ridge Boys, Charlie Daniels, Wynonna, and Brad Paisley provided musical tributes. The service was broadcast live on CMT, GAC, RFD-TV, The Nashville Network and FamilyNet as well as Nashville stations. SiriusXM and WSM 650 AM, home of the Grand Ole Opry, broadcast the event on the radio. The family requested that contributions be made to the Grand Ole Opry Trust Fund or to the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum.

Jones was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in Nashville. His death made headlines all over the world; many country stations (as well as a few of other formats, such as oldies/classic hits) abandoned or modified their playlists and played his songs throughout the day.

==Legacy==

Jones tirelessly defended the integrity of country music, telling &quot;Billboard&quot; in 2006, &quot;It&#x27;s never been for love of money. I thank God for it because it makes me a living. But I sing because I love it, not because of the dollar signs.&quot; Jones also went out of his way to promote younger country singers that he felt were as passionate about the music as he was. &quot;Everybody knows he&#x27;s a great singer,&quot; Alan Jackson stated in 1995, &quot;but what I like most about George is that when you meet him, he is like some old guy that works down at the gas station...even though he&#x27;s a legend!&quot;

Shortly after Jones&#x27;s death, Andrew Mueller wrote about his influence in &quot;Uncut&quot;, &quot;He was one of the finest interpretive singers who ever lifted a microphone...There cannot be a single country songwriter of the last 50-odd years who has not wondered what it might be like to hear their words sung by that voice.&quot; In an article for &quot;The Texas Monthly&quot; in 1994, Nick Tosches eloquently described the singer&#x27;s vocal style: &quot;While he and his idol, Hank Williams, have both affected generations with a plaintive veracity of voice that has set them apart, Jones has an additional gift—a voice of exceptional range, natural elegance, and lucent tone. Gliding toward high tenor, plunging toward deep bass, the magisterial portamento of his onward-coursing baritone emits white-hot sparks and torrents of blue, investing his poison love songs with a tragic gravity and inflaming his celebrations of the honky-tonk ethos with the hellfire of abandon.&quot; In an essay printed in &quot;The New Republic&quot;, David Hajdu writes:

:&quot;Jones had a handsome and strange voice. His singing was always partly about the appeal of the tones he produced, regardless of the meaning of the words. In this sense, Jones had something in common with singers of formal music and opera, though his means of vocal production were radically different from theirs. He sang from the back of his throat, rather than from deep in his diaphragm. He tightened his larynx to squeeze sound out. He clenched his jaw, instead of wriggling it free. He forced wind through his teeth, and the notes sounded weirdly beautiful.&quot;

David Cantwell recalled in 2013, &quot;His approach to singing, he told me once, was to call up those memories and feelings of his own that most closely corresponded to those being felt by the character in whatever song he was performing. He was a kind of singing method actor, creating an illusion of the real.&quot; In the liner notes to &quot;Essential George Jones: The Spirit of Country&quot; Rich Kienzle states, &quot;Jones sings of people and stories that are achingly human. He can turn a ballad into a catharsis by wringing every possible emotion from it, making it a primal, strangled cry of anguish&quot;. In 1994, country music historian Colin Escott pronounced, &quot;Contemporary country music is virtually founded on reverence for George Jones. Walk through a room of country singers and conduct a quick poll, George nearly always tops it.&quot; Waylon Jennings expressed a similar opinion in his song &quot;It&#x27;s Alright&quot;: &quot;If we all could sound like we wanted to, we&#x27;d all sound like George Jones.&quot; In the wake of Jones&#x27;s death, Merle Haggard pronounced in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;His voice was like a Stradivarius violin: one of the greatest instruments ever made.&quot; Emmylou Harris wrote, &quot;When you hear George Jones sing, you are hearing a man who takes a song and makes it a work of art—always,&quot; a quote that appeared on the sleeve of Jones&#x27;s 1976 album &quot;The Battle&quot;.

Several country music stars praised Jones in the documentary &quot;Same Ole Me&quot;. Randy Travis said, &quot;It sounds like he&#x27;s lived every minute of every word that he sings and there&#x27;s very few people who can do that.&quot; Tom T. Hall said, &quot;It was always Jones who got the message across just right.&quot; Roy Acuff said, &quot;I&#x27;d give anything if I could sing like George Jones.&quot; In the same film, producer Billy Sherrill states, &quot;All I did was change the instrumentation around him. I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s changed &quot;at all&quot;.&quot;

In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Jones at No. 24 on their list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

Jones was the subject of the second season of the podcast &quot;Cocaine and Rhinestones&quot;, which contends Jones is the greatest country music singer ever.

==Duets==
Jones released many duets over the course of his career. While his songs with Tammy Wynette are his best known, Jones claimed in his autobiography that he felt his duets with Melba Montgomery were his best. Jones also recorded duet albums with Gene Pitney and his former bass player Johnny Paycheck. Jones also recorded the duet albums &quot;My Very Special Guests&quot; (1979), &quot;A Taste of Yesterday&#x27;s Wine&quot; with Merle Haggard (1982), &quot;Ladies Choice&quot; (1984), &quot;Friends In High Places&quot; (1991), &quot;The Bradley Barn Sessions&quot; (1994), &quot;God&#x27;s Country: George Jones And Friends&quot; (2006), a second album with Merle Haggard called &quot;Kickin&#x27; Out The Footlights...Again&quot; (2006), and &quot;Burn Your Playhouse Down&quot; (2008).

<doc id="229029" wikidata="Q1754153" url="?curid=229029" title="Maersk Air">
<text>Maersk Air A/S was a Danish airline which operated between 1969 and 2005. Owned by the A. P. Møller–Mærsk Group, it operated a mix of scheduled and chartered passenger and cargo services. Headquartered at Dragør, its main operating bases were Copenhagen Airport, Billund Airport and Esbjerg Airport. The airline had offshore helicopter operations from 1975 to 1999 and had three airline subsidiaries: Maersk Air UK, Maersk Commuter, and Star Air.

The airline was founded on the foundations on the purchase of Falck Air on 21 February 1969. Fokker F27s were bought and domestic services from Copenhagen to Odense and Stauning. From 1971 to 1995 Maersk participated in Danair, which held a monopoly on all domestic services. Maersk Air was heavily involved in the inclusive tours market during the 1970s, operating the Boeing 720B and 737-200. From 1981 Maersk started international flights, first out of Billund and from the 1990s out of Copenhagen.

Maersk Air gradually invested in new aircraft, including the Fokker 50, Boeing 737 Classic, and later the 737-700. During the 1990s the number of international services increased, often codesharing with foreign airlines. With the Danish airlines deregulated in 1995, Maersk first sought to compete with Scandinavian Airlines. They later created a cartel. After being exposed, the airline fell into a decline after 2001, posting large deficits from which it never recovered. The airline was bought by the FL Group and merged with Sterling Airlines in 2005.

==History==
===Establishment===

The A. P. Moller-Maersk Group&#x27;s first investment in aviation was taken in 1937 when it bought a stake in Danish Air Lines, the flag carrier at the time. Its next step took place in 1967, when the group bought a Hawker Siddeley HS 125-3B as a corporate jet. At the time there were few options for Danish airlines. The charter market was dominated by Spies Rejser and Tjæreborgs Rejser, each with their own airlines—Conair and Sterling, respectively. Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) was the flag carrier and had the sole right to conduct international scheduled services, and freight charters could only be carried out if the entire load had a single shipper and recipient.
The establishment of the airline was approved by the group in 1969. The airline aimed at ad hoc charter with aircraft in the 50-seat market, and perhaps securing the rights to fly regional scheduled flights to smaller domestic airports. To secure a running organization, Maersk bought Falck Air on 21 February 1969 from the Falck Group. At the time Falck Air operated a fleet of two de Havilland Herons and two Hawker Siddeley HS 748 aircraft and a hangar at Copenhagen Airport, Kastrup. The Herons allowed Maersk to commence services from Copenhagen to Stauning Airport, a route taken over from Cimber Air. Meanwhile, the airline had ordered three Fokker F27 Friendships, the first which was delivered on 9 December. Operations to Odense Airport commenced on 26 December.

The new airline, Maersk Air I/S was officially incorporated on 1 January 1970. The same day it took over the assets in Falk Air along with its air operator&#x27;s certificate, concessions and the operational responsibility for the HS-125. The initially scheduled operations consisted of five daily trip pairs from Copenhagen to Odense Airport, and two daily pairs to Stauning Airport. Norwegian-American Finn Rassmussen Ryssdal was hired as the airline&#x27;s first director. He held the position for two years until he was replaced by another Norwegian, Johan Paus, former CEO of Scanair. As part of the establishment, Maersk entered the travel agency industry. Originally named Maersk Air Rejsebureau, was later named Maersk Travel.

===Initial operations===
The distribution of domestic routes was a contentious political issue. SAS held a privilege to commence any route they wanted, but lacked regional airlines to serve the smaller airports. It was complicated by the establishment of alternative domestic airlines in Norway and Sweden, Braathens SAFE and Linjeflyg, respectively. Danish authorities, therefore, asked the three scheduled carriers, SAS, Maersk, and Cimber, to negotiate to see if they could reach an agreement. An agreement was reached in November 1971, whereby the company Danair was established. Flights to Vágar Airport on the Faroe Islands commenced in 1971. Thisted Airport opened in 1971 and Maersk was allocated as the operator. The Thisted and Stauning services were transferred to Cimber Air in 1976, although Maersk continued to operate some services.
Maersk also aimed at serving the inclusive tours charter market. To gain better access to the market, Maersk bought two travel agents in December 1971, Raffels Rejser and Bangs Rejser. To better target the charter market, Maersk Air bought five used Boeing 720Bs in 1973. This was followed up with purchasing Unisol in 1974 and the three were merged to form a new agency under the brand Unisol and 120,000 annual trips. After having lost 100 million Danish krone (DKK) by 1979, Unison was sold to Tjæreborg in 1980. A participating cause was Unisol&#x27;s inability to profile itself in a market dominated by two high-profile, yet diametrical, owners.

Maersk Air was contracted by Maersk Oil to operate to the latter&#x27;s oil field in the North Sea. For this purpose, Maersk Air bought two Bell 212 helicopters. The airline stationed these at Esbjerg Airport and they commenced operations on 1 July 1975.
Maersk Air took delivery of its first two Boeing 737-200 Advanced in 1976. By 1981 the airline had taken delivery of fourteen aircraft. Some were leased to other carriers, including Guyana Airways, Malaysia Airlines and Tunisair. Others were used charter services, mostly to Danish inclusive tour operators. From 1983 three aircraft were entirely dedicated to this task. This was a highly competitive market, where Maersk had to compete with Conair, Sterling and Scanair, amongst others.

During the second half of the 1970s, Maersk focused on wet leasing their aircraft on the intercontinental market. Contracts included flying pilgrims from Morocco to Mecca and Scandinavians to North America. The 737-200s proved too large for domestic services. The F27s had been sold and the airline, therefore, determined that it needed to procure new turboprops. A decision was made to buy the de Havilland Dash 7, but in the meantime, the airline leased three HS 748s from 1980 to 1981. The first Dash 7 entered revenue service on 13 May 1981.
Maersk Air experienced falling profits at during the late 1970s. The revenue of DKK 535 million in 1979 fell to DKK 454 million in 1981, hitting a record loss of DKK 29 million in 1981. The company started hitting problems with liquidity and in 1981 was not able to pay its employees wages. Bjarne Hansen was hired as CEO that year. The number of bases for charter aircraft was reduced, cutting personnel costs. The two Beechcrafts were sold, as were nine other of the airline&#x27;s twenty-four aircraft. A key part of this plan was not allowing the aircraft to remain idle during the day, thus maximizing revenue. The number of employees were reduced from 720 to 480. By 1985 the revenue had risen to DKK 898 million in 1985, allowing the airline to make a profit of DKK 112 million in 1985.
Starting in 1981 Maersk Air started flying a Bell 212 under contract with the Cabinet of the Faroe Islands. By then the helicopter fleet had reached five Bell 212s. From 1983 the petroleum activity increased and two larger Eurocopter AS332 Super Pumas.

Danair was reorganized from 27 September 1982. SAS&#x27;s routes to Aalborg, Aarhus, and Rønne were taken into the Danair pool. Maersk on its side increased the number of departures on its services. The goal was to improve profitability. And although the scheme did rise passenger numbers, it failed to improve Maersk Air&#x27;s financial performance in the domestic market. Stauning was dropped from Maersk and Danair&#x27;s scheduled from 1 January 1983. From 1988 Maersk Air saw competition on its scheduled service to the Faroes, through the establishment of Atlantic Airways.

===International===

Maersk decided to look for possibilities to fly international routes. The first non-SAS international concession was in 1981 granted to Air Business from Esbjerg via Thistedt to Stavanger Airport, Sola in Norway, using an Embraer EMB-110 Bandeirante. Maersk Air bought the company in 1984 and bought two Short 360s. Soon the change to the concession was granted allowing the flight to operate from Aalborg instead of Thistedt, allowing for a greater catchment of passengers. The airline was kept as a regional subsidiary and took the name Maersk Commuter in 1988. It was dissolved in 1990.

Changes in European Community rules in 1984 allowed any carrier to operate intra-European routes, granted that they connected two regional airports. Maersk laid its eyes on Billund Airport, which was centrally located in Jutland and was classified as a regional airport. It was already a popular base for charter flights. London was a favored destination, but all the four primary airports were all categorized as primary airports. To exploit the new regulations, Maersk identified London Southend Airport, which was classified as a secondary airport. Maersk inaugurated the route on 29 November 1984 with two round trips, using Dash 7s. Due to the distance from the city Maersk could only market it as &quot;London&quot; if they included an onwards ticket with a train. The route carried about 12,000 passengers annually and failed to make a profit.
Maersk considered both Århus and Billund as the base for their Jutland operations, and settled for Billund. The next international route to inaugurate was to Cologne Bonn Airport in Germany in 1988, in cooperation with Lufthansa. It was flown with the Fokker 50, which had just entered into service with the airline. During the late 1980s Maersk Air started an expansion of its travel agencies, both domestically and abroad.

Based on the need for a replacement for the 737-200s, Boeing developed the shortened 737-500 on the request of Maersk and others. Maersk took delivery of its first -500 on 6 April 1990. From 1990 Maersk was free to compete on any intra-European international route. Using the new -500s, it focused on routes out of Billund, providing services to Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, Brussels Airport, London Gatwick Airport, Stockholm Arlanda Airport and Stavanger. In addition it flew from Copenhagen to London.

===New airlines===
Maersk Air Cargo, which only acted as a handling agent, was founded in 1982. Maersk Air was barred from operating a cargo fleet until deregulation in 1987. The Maersk Group then established Star Air. It took into use a fleet of F-27-600s. From 1993 it acquired a fleet of Boeing 727-100s and started hauling for United Parcel Service.
Maersk Air also decided to enter the British market. It bought part of the Plimsoll Line, which again bought Birmingham Executive Airways (BEA) and Brymon Airways. After a merger into Brymon European Airways and subsequent demerger, Maersk Air UK was founded on the foundations of BEA. It operated a series of international and domestic services out of Birmingham Airport, initially with a fleet of three Jetstream 31 and three BAC One-Elevens. Maersk signed a franchise agreement in which Maersk Air UK would fly with British Airways livery and flight codes, but at their own expense and their own aircraft and crew. The 1-11s were replaced with Boeing 737-500s in 1996. Bombardier CRJ200s were introduced two years later.

Maersk also secured a 49-percent stake in Estonian Air, after having beaten SAS in a privatization tender. Two of Maersk Air&#x27;s Fokker 50s were leased to Estonian Air, who also took delivery of two 737-500s, replacing the older Soviet fleet.

===Danish deregulation===

Maersk Air began services from Billund to Frankfurt in 1993, and a year later it started flights from Copenhagen to Kristiansand. To meet the upcoming deregulation, Maersk carried out a major fleet rearrangement in 1993. The airline sold its Fokker 50s and leased them back. Meanwhile, it procured six Boeing 737-500s, which were delivered in 1996.

Unlike Cimber, Maersk initially declined to participate in SAS&#x27; frequent-flyer program, EuroBonus, which was founded in 1992. With the demise of Danair, Maersk Air focused on improving its international connections. Its primary strategy was to establish routes from Billund to European destinations with codeshare agreements with major European airlines. Gradually the services were upgraded from Fokker 50 to 737-500s. Danair was dissolved on 1 October 1995, when the domestic airline industry in Denmark was deregulated.
Maersk&#x27;s success in Jutland was noticed by SAS, who in October 1996 opened its first service out of Billund, to Frankfurt. This was the first route in which the two airlines competed for head to head. In response, Maersk Air commenced services out of SAS&#x27; stronghold at Copenhagen Airport to Milan, Geneva and Stockholm the following year. Additional routes out of Billund were added in 1997. Flemming Knudsen took the position as CEO on 12 January 1998. On 3 March the first 737-700 was delivered, with Maersk Air being the European launch customer.

With its eight daily round trips, Maersk Air only captured ten percent of the market on the Copenhagen–Stockholm route, losing money on it. Maersk, therefore, started negotiations with British Airways and KLM to see if they could become part of an airline alliance. They were in close negotiations with what would become Oneworld, but pulled out in the last minute.

With the 14 June 1998 opening of the Great Belt Fixed Link, car, coach and rail transport became faster between Jutland and Funen on the one hand, and Zealand on the other, cutting travel time by an hour. This had an effect on patronage, with a significant drop in domestic traffic. 
The same year the government introduced a domestic air tax of DKK 150 on all domestic flights, which further contributed to the fall in domestic ridership. Maersk Air anticipated a significant drop and reduced services from a 737-500 to a Fokker 50. Yet passenger numbers dropped to a third and the service was terminated on 13 June 1998. Ole Dietz took over as managing director on 1 March 1999.

After the Oneworld negotiations failed, Maersk Air turned to SAS in an attempt to initiate a cooperation. Negotiations commenced in early 1997, and the deal was announced on 8 October 1998, and took effect 28 March 1999. Maersk would adopt EuroBonus and codeshare all domestic flights, flights out of Copenhagen and select Billund services. In addition to the publicly stated clauses, the agreement also contained a series of illegal collusions. Maersk and SAS split up the market between them, so they no longer would fly on competing routes. This involved that Maersk Air would withdraw from its Copenhagen services to Stockholm and Geneva. Maersk Air also agreed to—gradually so to not awake suspicion—withdraw from its various codeshare agreements with other airlines than SAS.
The case was followed up by the EU Commission and the Danish authorities, who carried out a dawn raid on 15 June 2000. Maersk Air was sentenced to a fine of €17.5 million, while SAS was fined €43.75 million. As a consequence, Dietz resigned as CEO and Hansen, who had been appointed chairman, also withdrew. Flemming Ipsen was hired as a new CEO, while Troels Dilling was hired as chairman.

===Decline===
Maersk was struck by a series of labor disputes in 1998 and 1999. At the turn of the century Maersk Air fell into financial distress. The airline was struck hard by the 2001 airline recession, making a loss that year of DKK 341 million. Ridership increased in 2002, largely through the increased sale of discounted tickets. Maersk Air therefore turned to divest its non-core activities. Estonian Air was sold to SAS in 2003. The British subsidiary lost an accumulative DKK 325 million from 2000 through 2002. The company was therefore sold in a management buyout in 2003, with the airline becoming Duo Airways.
The Maersk Group was forced to issue more than DKK 700 million in the airline from 2002 to 2005. In late 2003 the Maersk Aircraft A/S was established to own the fleet, spurring speculation in the media that Maersk was planning of liquidating the company. The year gave a net loss of DKK 841 million.

In the years following the cartel case, almost the entire executive management of the airline was replaced. A large portion of the new management was without experience from the aviation industry. On 1 November 2003 Ipsen was replaced as CEO by Finn Øelund, who came from the same position in Air Greenland. He devised a new strategy, in which the airline would better utilize its fleet by placing flights closer to each other and flying throughout the day. He also proposed competing head-on with SAS, as he believed that Maersk Air with the new strategy could operate with lower costs than the consortium. Aircraft received a new white and dark blue livery, replacing the old light-blue Maersk colors. The airline adopted the slogan &quot;fly as you like&quot; and focused its route production on typical holiday destinations and cheap fares.
Since 2002 Maersk had seen competition in the scheduled market from Sterling, which had reorganized itself as a low-cost carrier targeting the Mediterranean leisure market. In 2005 Fred. Olsen &amp; Co. sold the airline to FL Group. The Maersk Group announced on 30 June 2005 that it would sell Maersk Air to Sterling. Star Air and the corporate jet were kept out of the deal. Ownership of the 737 was also not included, and instead, there were leased to Sterling. The sales price of Maersk Air was never made public.

==Operations==

Maersk Air I/S was until 1996 organized as a partnership (), which was again owned by two subsidiaries within the Maersk Group. This allowed the company to report less detailed accounts, and hindered competitors from gaining as good a picture of the company&#x27;s economic situation. Maersk Air I/S was reorganized in 1996. The partnership model was abandoned and instead, the airline became a limited company () directly under the mother company. Star Air on its side became a subsidiary of Maersk Air.

Half of Maersk Air&#x27;s accumulative profits came from the sale of used aircraft. Inspired form the importance of crucial timing of purchase and sale of ships, Maersk Air made several advantages deals. One of the involved selling 737-200s at a higher price than they had paid for them. Maersk was an early customer of the Fokker 50, of which the first was delivered in 1988. As part of the purchase agreement, they would receive DKK one million per sold aircraft in the Nordic Counties. This turned out well as SAS and Braathens SAFE bought a combined twenty units.
From 1974 to 1999 Maersk Air operated a helicopter division out of Esbjerg Airport. These were contracted by Maersk Oil, which operated offshore oil platforms in the North Sea.

Throughout its existence, Maersk Air operated a corporate jet for the Maersk Group. Five different aircraft were used in series, first consisting of two Hawker Siddeley HS 125, since 1997 opting for a Bombardier Challenger 600. These were all named &quot;Jette Maersk&quot; and served two purposes. First, they were used for flying executives. Secondly, the aircraft were dispatched to send mechanics and spare parts of serve ships of Maersk Line and other shipping companies within the group. Because this could minimize downtime due to mechanical failure, the latter proved a highly profitable endeavor.

===Ground handling===

Initially, Maersk and the other major Danish airlines had a common ground handling company, Copenhagen Air Services, at the eponymous airport. In 1994 Maersk Air bought out the other owners of Copenhagen Air Services. Within three years it was making a DKK 46-million profit from a DKK 401-million revenue. In 1998 Maersk merged the company with the ground handling company owned by the Swedish Civil Aviation Administration, creating Novia. It operated ground handling services at the airports in Copenhagen, Stockholm-Arlanda and Gothenburg-Landvetter.

With the deregulation of the handling market from 1999, entranced with lower costs took over a substantial portion of the market. Novia failed to retain its profits and lost DKK 80 million from 1999 to 2001. The CAA sold to Aviapartner in 2001, but the cooperation was poor. Maersk Air eventually let the company be file for bankruptcy.

===Subsidiary airlines===

SAS held a 51-percent share of the company, while Maersk received 34 percent and Cimber 15 percent. Initially, it was to organize domestic flights and in the long run become a separate operator. Danair bought services from the three airlines, who retained flights to their respective destinations. Then Danair would set prices and sell tickets on the flights and the profits were paid out in relation to the ownership shares. The airlines were paid a fixed price, irrespective of their actual operating costs.

Maersk Commuter was based at Esbjerg Airport and operated as a subsidiary of Maersk Air between 1984 and 1990. It flew a single route, from Esbjerg via Aalborg to Stavanger. It operated a fleet of two Short 360s.
Maersk Air UK operated in the United Kingdom between 1993 and 2003. It operated under a franchise agreement with British Airways with its base at Birmingham Airport. It employed the BA branding, including aircraft livery, uniforms, in-flight service, and catering, as well as terminal services. It also employed BA&#x27;s flight codes and reservation system. Flights qualified for miles on BA&#x27;s frequent-flyer program, Executive Club.

Star Air was from 1996 to 2004 a cargo airline subsidiary of Maersk Air. It operated a fleet of cargo jetliners, notably the Boeing 727 and Boeing 757, on long-term contracts with United Parcel Service. These operations were based in UPS&#x27;s main European hub at Cologne Bonn Airport in Germany.

A 49-percent stake in Estonian Air was owned by Maersk Air between 1996 and 2003. The flag carrier of Estonia was based at Tallinn Airport and flew a limited international network, using a combination of Boeing 737-500s and Fokker 50s.

===Travel agencies===
As part of the establishment, Maersk entered the travel agency industry. Originally named Maersk Air Rejsebureau, this department was later named Maersk Travel. It bought Expert Rejser in 1987 and established international agencies in London, Hong Kong, and Singapore. It gradually built up a nationwide network of travel agency outlets, in Ålborg, Århus, Copenhagen, Esbjerg, Herning, Horsens, Odense and Skive. In the following years it bought several smaller agencies and in 1990 entered a cooperation with DSB Rejsebureau. A common agency was established in Esbjerg and negotiations regarding a fusion were initiated. But both parent companies wanted to be the &quot;locomotive&quot; in the new company, and the deal fell through. Maersk Travel was merged with DFDS Travel in 1997, to create Maersk DFDS Travel. This proved a difficult process and Maersk pulled out of the new company in 1999.
Maersk also aimed at serving the inclusive tours charter market. To gain better access to the market, Maersk bought two travel agents in December 1971, Raffels Rejser and Bangs Rejser. This was followed up with purchasing Unisol in 1974 and the three were merged to form a new agency under the brand Unisol and 120,000 annual trips. Unisol—Denmark&#x27;s third-largest inclusive tours travel agency—was placed under the industrial department in Maersk, while the airline reported directly to the executive administration. This caused a lack of coordination between the companies and Maersk never made money from the inclusive tours operations. After having lost 100 million Danish krone (DKK) by 1979, Unison was sold to Tjæreborg in 1980.

==Fleet==
The following is a list of aircraft operated by Maersk Air, including its helicopter and corporate jet divisions. It excludes aircraft operated by Star Air, Maersk Commuter, and Maersk Air UK. The list consists of the total number of aircraft operated by the airline (although the peak number operated may be lower), the year the type was first introduced and the year the last aircraft was taken out of service.

==Accidents and incidents==
Maersk Air has been subject to three write-off accidents, of which one resulted in fatalities:

The first accident took place on 27 December 1969, ten days after the accident aircraft, a Fokker F27 with registration OY-APD, had been delivered to the airline. It was being used for training flight in poor weather conditions at Bornholm Airport. After carrying out a touch and go, the aircraft failed to stay airborne due to icing on the wings. It slid off the runway and into the Baltic Sea.

On 25 January 1975 the F27 OY-APB was carrying out a landing on a wet and icy runway at Vágar Airport. Without having been informed of the conditions, the pilots veered the aircraft off the runway and collided with terrain.

The fatal accident took place on 2 January 1984. A Bell 212 with registration OY-HMC crashed into the North Sea during a flight from Esbjerg Airport to an oil platform. There arose a breach in the steering system and the pilots lost control of the helicopter. This caused the aircraft to start to spin and the pilots to reduce speed to regain control. This caused a loss of height and eventually brought the helicopter to an emergency landing on the water. Both pilots and a passenger were killed in the crash.

<text>Rarotonga is the largest and most populous of the Cook Islands. The island is volcanic, with an area of , and is home to almost 75% of the country&#x27;s population, with 10,898 of a total population of 15,040. The Cook Islands&#x27; Parliament buildings and international airport are on Rarotonga. Rarotonga is a popular tourist destination with many resorts, hotels and motels. The chief town, Avarua, on the north coast, is the capital of the Cook Islands.

Captain John Dibbs, master of the colonial brig &quot;Endeavour&quot;, is credited as the European discoverer on 25 July 1823, while transporting the missionary Reverend John Williams.

== Geography ==

Rarotonga is a kidney-shaped volcanic island, in circumference, and wide on its longest (east-west) axis. The island is the summit of an extinct Pliocene or Pleistocene volcano, which rises from the seafloor. The island was formed between 2.3 to 1.6 million years ago, with a later stage of volcanism between 1.4 and 1.1 million years ago. While its position is consistent with being formed by the Macdonald hotspot, its age is too young, and its formation is attributed to a short-lived Rarotonga hotspot, or to rejuvenated volcanism at Aitutaki.

The core of the island consists of densely forested hills cut by deep valleys, the eroded remnants of the original volcanic cone. The hills are drained by a number of radial streams, including the Avatiu Stream and Takuvaine Stream. Te Manga, at 658 m (2,140 ft) above sea level, is the highest peak on the island. Ikurangi, a smaller peak, overlooks the capital.

The hills are surrounded by a low coastal plain consisting of beaches, a storm ridge, lowland swamps, and alluvial deposits. This in turn is surrounded by a fringing reef, which ranges from wide. The reef is shallow, with a maximum depth of , and has a number of passages, notably at Avarua, Avatiu and Ngatangiia. Beyond the reef crest, the outer reef slopes steeply to deep water. 

The lagoon is at its widest off the southeast coast in the area of the Muri Lagoon. This area contains four small islets or &quot;motu&quot;. From north to south, the islets are:
#Motutapu, 
#Oneroa, 
#Koromiri, 
#Taakoka, 

Another small islet, Motutoa, lies on the reef flat on the northwest coast.

==Natural environment==
The interior of the island is dominated by eroded volcanic peaks cloaked in dense vegetation. Paved and unpaved roads allow access to valleys but the interior of the island remains largely unpopulated due to forbidding terrain and lack of infrastructure.

===Takitumu Conservation Area===
A tract of of land has been set aside in the south-east as the Takitumu Conservation Area to protect native birds and plants, especially the Vulnerable kakerori or Rarotonga monarch. Other threatened birds in the conservation area include the Rarotonga fruit dove and Rarotonga starling. The site has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International.

==History==

The earliest evidence of human presence in the Southern Cook Islands has been dated to around AD 1000. Oral tradition tells that Rarotonga was settled by various groups, including Ata-i-te-kura, Apopo-te-akatinatina and Apopo-te-ivi-roa in the ninth century, and Tangi&#x27;ia Nui from Tahiti and Karika from Samoa in 1250. An early &quot;ariki&quot;, Toi, is said to have built &quot;Te Ara Nui o Toi&quot; or &quot;Ara Metua&quot;, a paved road that encircles the island, though the sites adjacent to it are dated to 1530. Trading contact was maintained with the Austral Islands, Samoa and the Marquesas to import basalt that was used for making local adze heads, while a pottery fragment found on Ma&#x27;uke has been traced to Tongatapu to the west, the main island of Tonga. The ultimate origin of almost all the islanders’ settlement cargo can be traced back to Southeast Asia: not just their chickens, Pacific rats, Polynesian pigs, Pacific dogs and crops, but also several kinds of lizards and snails. Among the species that are understood to have reached Rarotonga by this means are at least two species of geckos and three of skinks. Likewise, the ultimate origin of almost 30 of their crops lies in the west.

According to New Zealand Māori tradition, Kupe, the discoverer of Aotearoa, visited Rarotonga, and the Māori migration canoes &quot;Tākitimu, Te Arawa, Tainui, Mātaatua, Tokomaru, Aotea&quot;, and &quot;Kurahaupō&quot; passed through on their way to Aotearoa. 

Fletcher Christian visited the island in 1789 on but did not land. Captain Theodore Walker sighted the island in 1813 on the ship &quot;Endeavour&quot;. The first recorded landing by a European was Captain Philip Goodenough with William Wentworth in 1814 on the schooner &quot;Cumberland&quot;. On 25 July 1823, while transporting the missionary Reverend John Williams, the &quot;Endeavour&quot; returned to Rarotonga. Papeiha, a London Missionary Society evangelist from Bora Bora, went ashore to teach his religion. Further missionaries followed, and by 1830 the island had converted to Christianity.&quot;RARATONGA [[[Typographical error|sic]]] National Flag&quot; (Rarotonga) in 1899 publication by the [[United States Navy]] book, &quot;&quot;|left|190x190pxFrom 1830 to 1850, Rarotonga was a popular stop for whalers and trading schooners, and trade began with the outside world. The missionaries attempted to exclude other Europeans as a bad influence, and in 1845 Rarotongan &quot;ariki&quot; prohibited the sale of land to Europeans, though they were allowed to rent land on an annual basis. Despite a further ban on foreign settlement in 1848, European traders began to settle. In 1865, driven by rumours that France planned to annex the islands, the &quot;ariki&quot; of Rarotonga unsuccessfully petitioned Governor George Grey of New Zealand for British protection. In 1883 the Royal navy &quot;de facto&quot; recognised the &quot;ariki&quot; of Rarotonga as an independent government. By this time Makea Takau Ariki had become paramount among the &quot;ariki&quot;, and was recognised as the &quot;Queen of Rarotonga&quot; on a visit to New Zealand. In 1888 the island became a British protectorate after a petition from the &quot;ariki&quot;. In 1901, it was annexed by New Zealand.Oranges had been introduced by the &quot;Bounty&quot; mutineers, and after annexation developed into a major export crop, though exports had been disrupted by poor shipping. In 1945 the industry was revived with a government-led citrus replanting scheme, and in 1961 a canning factory was opened to allow the export of juice. The industry survived until the 1980s, but collapsed after New Zealand adopted Rogernomics and removed privileged market access.

An airstrip was built in 1944, leading to regular flights to Fiji, Tonga, Samoa and Aitutaki. The airport and better shipping links saw the beginnings of large-scale migration to New Zealand. Emigration increased further in the early 1970&#x27;s when the airport was upgraded, but this was balanced by immigration from elsewhere in the Cook Islands.

Flooding in April and May 1967 damaged bridges on the island and caused widespread crop losses, raising risks of a food shortage. An unnamed tropical cyclone in December of that year left hundreds homeless and caused widespread devastation after demolishing homes and offices in Avarua. In December 1976 80% of the island&#x27;s banana crop was destroyed by tropical cyclone Kim. In January 1987 Tropical Cyclone Sally made a thousand people homeless and damaged 80% of the buildings in Avarua.

==Demographics and settlements==


The population of Rarotonga was 13007 in 2016.

The island is traditionally divided into three tribal districts or &quot;vaka&quot;. Te Au O Tonga on the northern side of the island (Avarua is the capital), Takitumu on the eastern and southern side and Puaikura on the western side. For administrative purposes it is divided into five Land Districts. The Land District of Avarua is represented under vaka Te Au O Tonga, the Land Districts of Matavera, Ngatangiia and Titikaveka are represented under vaka Takitumu and the Land District Arorangi is represented under vaka Puaikura. The districts are subdivided into 54 tapere (traditional sub-districts).

In 2008, the three vaka councils of Rarotonga were abolished.

== Area attractions ==
Palm-studded white sandy beaches fringe most of the island, and there is a popular cross-island walk that connects Avatiu valley with the south side of the island. It passes the Te Rua Manga, the prominent needle-shaped rock visible from the air and some coastal areas. Hikes can also be taken to the Raemaru, or flat-top mountain. Other attractions include Wigmore Falls (Papua Falls) and the ancient marae, Arai te Tonga.

Popular island activities include snorkeling, scuba diving, bike riding, kite surfing, hiking, deep-sea fishing, boat tours, scenic flights, going to restaurants, dancing, seeing island shows, squash, tennis, zipping around on mopeds, and sleeping on the beach. There are many churches open for service on Sunday, with a cappella singing. People congregate at the sea wall that skirts the end of the airport&#x27;s runway to be &quot;jetblasted&quot; by aircraft.

== Transport ==

Rarotonga has three harbours, Avatiu, Avarua and Avana, of which only Avatiu harbour is of commercial significance. The Port of Avatiu serves a small fleet of inter-island and fishing vessels, with cargo ships regularly visiting from New Zealand via other Pacific Islands ports. Large cruise ships regularly visit Rarotonga but the port is too small for cruise ships to enter and they are required to anchor off shore outside the harbour. The island is encircled by a main road, Ara Tapu, that traces the coast. Three-quarters of Rarotonga is also encircled by the ancient inner road, Ara Metua. Approximately long, this road was constructed in 11th century and for most or all of its whole length was paved with large stone slabs. Along this road are several important marae, including Arai Te Tonga, the most sacred shrine in Rarotonga. Due to the mountainous interior, there is no road crossing the island. Rarotonga has only two bus routes: clockwise and anticlockwise. The clockwise bus runs from morning operating an hourly schedule until a last service at 11pm. The anti-clockwise route leaves Avarua on the half-hour, with the last service at 4.30 pm. Although there are bus stops, the buses pick up and set down anywhere en route.

Rarotonga International Airport is the international airport of the Cook Islands.

<text>Paul Ross Spadafora (born September 5, 1975) is an American retired professional boxer. He is the former IBF lightweight champion of the world, and has challenged once for a light welterweight world title.

==Personal background==
Known as &quot;The Pittsburgh Kid&quot;, Spadafora is from McKees Rocks, a borough outside of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His childhood was poverty-stricken: his father died of a drug overdose when he was nine, and he was homeless for several weeks as a teenager. He started boxing when he was eleven, and left school in 9th grade to focus on it.

==Troubles outside the ring==
Spadafora was an alcoholic from a young age and at one point also abused drugs. He pleaded guilty to aggravated assault for shooting his girlfriend Nadine Russo in the chest in October 2003 after a night of drinking, and in February 2005 was sentenced to six months in a bootcamp-style rehabilitation center. He had by then become engaged to Russo and she had born his second child. He ultimately went to prison for the crime.

In September and October 2011, Spadafora was twice arrested on DUI charges. The following September he pleaded guilty.

On September 23, 2012, his manager filed suit against him in Allegheny County court for breach of contract.

==Comeback==
Despite his troubles outside the ring, Spadafora repeatedly expressed his intention to return to the ring. In November 2006 he returned after a 32-month layoff to stop Jesus Francisco Zepeda in round five at the Avalon Hotel in Erie, Pennsylvania.

On April 25, 2008, again in Erie, Spadafora returned to the ring to fight Shad Howard. Spadafora repeatedly connected with sharp jabs and combinations en route to an 80–72 unanimous decision.

In 2010 he defeated Italian boxer Ivan Fiorletta by knock out. In August 2012 he defeated Humberto Toledo.

One April 6, 2013, Spadafora defeated Robert Franckel for the NABF Super Lightweight Championship.

<doc id="229045" wikidata="Q832436" url="?curid=229045" title="Pager">
<text>A pager, also known as a beeper or bleeper, is a wireless telecommunications device that receives and displays alphanumeric or voice messages. One-way pagers can only receive messages, while response pagers and two-way pagers can also acknowledge, reply to, and originate messages using an internal transmitter.

Pagers operate as part of a paging system which includes one or more fixed transmitters (or in the case of response pagers and two-way pagers, one or more base stations), as well as a number of pagers carried by mobile users. These systems can range from a restaurant system with a single low power transmitter, to a nationwide system with thousands of high-power base stations.

Pagers were developed in the 1950s and 1960s, and became widely used by the 1980s through the late 1990s and early 2000s. Later in the 21st century, the widespread availability of Cellphones and smartphones with text messaging capability has greatly diminished the pager industry. Nevertheless, pagers continue to be used by some emergency services and public safety personnel, because modern pager systems&#x27; coverage overlap, combined with use of satellite communications, can make paging systems more reliable than based cellular networks in some cases, including during natural and human-made disasters. This resilience has led public safety agencies to adopt pagers over cellular and other commercial services for critical messaging.
== History ==

The first telephone pager system was patented in 1949 by Al Gross. Intended for the use of physicians, there was initial resistance to the idea of being permanently on-call, according to Gross. 

One of the first practical paging services was launched in 1950 for physicians in the New York City area. Physicians paid US$12 per month and carried a pager that would receive phone messages within of a single transmitter tower. The system was manufactured by the Reevesound Company and operated by Telanswerphone. In 1960, John Francis Mitchell combined elements of Motorola&#x27;s walkie-talkie and automobile radio technologies to create the first transistorized pager, and from that time, paging technology continued to advance and pager adoption among emergency personnel was still popular as of July 2016.

In 1962, the Bell System, the U.S. telephone monopoly, presented its Bellboy radio paging system at the Seattle World&#x27;s Fair. Bellboy was the first commercial system for personal paging. It also marked one of the first consumer applications of the transistor (invented by Bell Labs in 1947), for which three Bell Labs inventors received a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1956. Solid-state circuitry enabled the Bellboy pager, about the size of a small TV remote device, to fit into a customer&#x27;s pocket or purse, quite a feat at that time. The Bellboy was a terminal that notified the user when someone was trying to call them. Bell System Bellboy radio pagers each used three reed receiver relays, each relay tuned to one of 33 different frequencies, selectively ringing a particular customer when all three relays were activated at the same time—a precursor of DTMF. When the person received an audible signal (a buzz) on the pager, the user found a telephone and called the service center, which informed the user of the caller&#x27;s message. 

In the mid-1980s, tone and voice radio paging became popular among emergency responders and professionals. Tone and voice pagers were activated either by a local base station, or through a telephone number assigned to each individual pager. In the 1990s, pagers became popular among the general public as a cheaper, smaller, and more reliable alternative to mobile phones. The ReFLEX protocol was developed in the mid-1990s.

As prices for mobile phones declined, small form factor phones like the Motorola StarTAC and the Nokia Series 40 line came on the market, cellular connectivity expanded, and digital phones adopted text messaging, most pager customers outside of specialist fields migrated to mobile phones toward the end of the 1990s. While Motorola announced the end of its new pager manufacturing in 2001, pagers remained in use in large hospital complexes. First responders in rural areas with inadequate cellular coverage are often issued pagers.

The 2005 London bombings resulted in overload of TETRA systems by the emergency services and showed that pagers, with their absence of necessity to transmit an acknowledgement before showing the message, and the related capability to operate on very low signal levels, are not completely outclassed by their successors. Volunteer firefighters, EMS paramedics and rescue squad members usually carry pagers to alert them of emergency call outs for their department. These pagers receive a special tone from a fire department radio frequency.
Restaurant pagers remain in wide use since the 2000s. Customers are given a portable receiver that would usually vibrate, flash, or beep when a table becomes free or when their meal is ready. Pagers have been popular with birdwatchers in Great Britain and Ireland since 1991, with companies Rare Bird Alert and Birdnet Information offering news of rare birds sent to pagers that they sell.

Today, companies like Visiplex offer similar solutions for onsite pager systems in the medical, education and commercial sectors.

===Decline===
By early 2002, pager usage was rapidly declining in places like North America due to the proliferation of cellular telephones.

The U.S. paging industry generated $2.1 billion in revenue in 2008, down from $6.2 billion in 2003. In Canada, 161,500 Canadians paid $18.5 million for pager service in 2013. Telus, one of the three major mobile carriers, announced the end to its Canadian pager service as of 31 March 2015, but rivals Bell, Rogers and PageNet intend to continue service.

In 2017 the UK National Health Service was thought to have been using over 10% of the remaining pagers in the world (130,000), with an annual cost of £6.6 million. Matt Hancock, (then) Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, announced in February 2019 that the 130,000 pagers still in use were to be phased out. NHSX announced plans in May 2020 to replace pagers and bleepers with &quot;more modern communication tools,&quot; accelerated by the pressure placed on the service by the COVID-19 pandemic in England. In August 2020, a new procurement framework for clinical communications was launched which was intended to phase out pagers by the end of 2021, replacing them with &quot;dedicated clinical-facing communication and tasks management tools&quot; from 25 approved suppliers.

In Japan, more than ten million pagers were active in 1996. On 1 October 2019, Japan&#x27;s last paging service provider shut down radio signals and terminated its service.

In Russia, the last paging provider was closed in November 2021.

== Design ==

Many paging network operators now allow numeric and textual pages to be submitted to the paging networks via email. A significant convenience for users given the widespread adoption of email, and commonalities in delivery assurances. This can result in pager messages being delayed or lost. Older forms of message submission using the Telelocator Alphanumeric Protocol involve modem connections directly to a paging network and are less subject to these delays. For this reason, older forms of message submission retain their usefulness for disseminating highly-important alerts to users such as emergency services personnel.

Common paging protocols include TAP, FLEX, ReFLEX, POCSAG, GOLAY, ERMES and NTT. Past paging protocols include Two-tone and 5/6-tone. In the United States, pagers typically receive signals using the FLEX protocol in the 900 MHz band. Commercial paging transmitters typically radiate 1000 watts of effective power, resulting in a much wider coverage area per tower than a mobile phone transmitter, which typically radiates around 0.6 watts per channel. Although FLEX paging networks tend to have stronger in-building coverage than mobile phone networks, commercial paging service providers will work with large institutions to install repeater equipment in the event that service is not available in needed areas of the subscribing institution&#x27;s buildings. This is especially critical in hospital settings where emergency staff must be able to reliably receive pages to respond to patient needs.

Unlike mobile phones, most one-way pagers do not display any information about whether a signal is being received or about the strength of the received signal. Since one-way pagers do not contain transmitters, one-way paging networks have no way to track whether a message has been successfully delivered to a pager. Because of this, if a one-way pager is turned off or is not receiving a usable signal at the time a message is transmitted, the message will not be received and the sender of the message will not be notified of this fact. In the mid-1990s, some paging companies began offering a service, which allowed a customer to call their pager number and have numeric messages read back to them. This was useful for times when the pager was off or out of the coverage area, as it would know what pages were sent to the subscriber even if the subscriber never actually received the page. Other radio bands used for pagers include the 400 MHz band, the VHF band and the FM commercial broadcast band (88–108&amp;MHz). Other paging protocols used in the VHF, 400 MHz UHF and 900 MHz bands include POCSAG and ERMES. In Canada and the United States, pagers that use the commercial FM band receive a subcarrier, called the Subsidiary Communications Authority, of a broadcast station. On-site paging systems in hospitals, unlike wide area paging systems, are local area services. Hospitals commonly use on-site paging for communication with staff and increasingly for contacting waiting patients when their appointment is due. These offer waiting patients the opportunity to leave the waiting area, but still be contacted.

== Operation ==
Paging systems are operated by commercial carriers, often as a subscription service and they are also operated directly by end users as private systems. Commercial carrier systems tend to cover a larger geographical area than private systems, while private systems tend to cover their limited area more thoroughly and deliver messages faster than commercial systems. In all systems, clients send messages to pagers, an activity commonly referred to as &quot;paging&quot;. System operators often assign unique phone numbers or email addresses to pagers (and pre-defined groups of pagers), enabling clients to page by telephone call, e-mail and SMS. Paging systems also support various types of direct connection protocols, which sacrifice global addressing and accessibility for a dedicated communications link. Automated monitoring and escalation software clients, often used in hospitals, IT departments and alarm companies, tend to prefer direct connections because of the increased reliability. Small paging systems, such as those used in restaurant and retail establishments, often integrate a keyboard and paging system into a single box, reducing both cost and complexity.

Paging systems support several popular direct connection protocols, including TAP, TNPP, SNPP and WCTP, as well as proprietary modem- and socket-based protocols. Additionally, organizations often integrate paging systems with their Voice-mail and PBX systems, conceptually attaching pagers to a telephone extension and set up web portals to integrate pagers into other parts of their enterprise. A paging system alerts a pager (or group of pagers) by transmitting information over an RF channel, including an address and message information. This information is formatted using a paging protocol, such as 2-tone, 5/6-tone, GOLAY, POCSAG, FLEX, ERMES, or NTT. Two-way pagers and response pagers typically use the ReFLEX protocol.

Modern paging systems typically use multiple base transmitters to modulate the same signal on the same RF channel, a design approach called &quot;simulcast&quot;. This type of design enables pagers to select the strongest signal from several candidate transmitters using FM capture, thereby improving overall system performance. Simulcast systems often use satellite to distribute identical information to multiple transmitters and GPS at each transmitter to precisely time its modulation relative to other transmitters. The coverage overlap, combined with use of satellite communications, can make paging systems more reliable than terrestrial based cellular networks in some cases, including during natural and human-made disaster. This resilience has led public safety agencies to adopt pagers over cellular and other commercial services for critical messaging.

== Categories ==

Pagers themselves vary from very cheap and simple beepers, to more complex personal communications equipment, falling into eight main categories.

; Beepers or tone-only pagers: Beepers or tone-only pagers are the simplest and least expensive form of paging. They were named beepers because they originally made a beeping noise, but current pagers in this category use other forms of alert as well. Some use audio signals, others light up and some vibrate, often used in combination. The majority of restaurant pagers fall into this category.
; Voice/tone: Voice/Tone pagers enable pager users to listen to a recorded voice message when an alert is received.
; Numeric: Numeric Pagers contain a numeric LCD display capable of displaying the calling phone number or other numeric information generally up to 10 digits. The display can also convey pager codes, a set of number codes corresponding to mutually understood pre-defined messages.
; Alphanumeric: Alphanumeric pagers contain a more sophisticated LCD capable of displaying text and icons. These devices receive text messages, often through email or direct connection to the paging system. The sender must enter a message, either numeric and push # or, text &amp; push # or a verbal message. The pager does not automatically record the sender&#x27;s number; the pager will beep but no message can be seen or heard if none has been entered.
; Response: Response pagers are alphanumeric pagers equipped with built-in transmitters, with the ability to acknowledge/confirm messages. They also allow the user to reply to messages by way of a multiple-choice response list, and to initiate &quot;canned&quot; messages from pre-programmed address and message lists. These devices are sometimes called &quot;1.5-way pagers&quot; or &quot;1.7-way pagers&quot; depending on capabilities.
; Two-way: Two-way pagers are response pagers with built-in QWERTY keyboards. These pagers allow the user to reply to messages, originate messages and forward messages using free-form text as well as &quot;canned&quot; responses.
; One-way modems: One-way modems are controllers with integrated paging receivers, which are capable of taking local action based on messages and data they receive.
; Two-way modems: Two-way modems have capabilities similar to one-way modems. They can also confirm messages and transmit their own messages and data.

== Security ==
Pagers have certain privacy advantages and disadvantages compared with cellular phones. Since a one-way pager is a passive receiver only (it sends no information back to the base station), its location cannot be tracked. However, this can also be disadvantageous, as a message sent to a pager must be broadcast from every paging transmitter in the pager&#x27;s service area. Thus, if a pager has nationwide service, a message sent to it could be intercepted by criminals or law enforcement agencies anywhere within the nationwide service area.

==Attacks==
On September 17, 2024, a massive attack against Hezbollah members in Lebanon and Syria was allegedly committed by Israel, who simultaneously detonated pagers that they were using. Lebanese Health authorities confirmed at least nine deaths and over 3,000 injuries as a result of the explosions. In February 2024, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah had told the group&#x27;s members to use pagers instead of cell phones, claiming that Israel had infiltrated their mobile phone network.

== In popular culture ==
As is the case with many new technologies, the functionality of the pager shifted from necessary professional use to a social tool integrated in one&#x27;s personal life. During the rise of the pager, it became the subject of various forms of media, most notably in the 1990s hip-hop scene. Popular artists from the era, including Ice Cube, Method Man, and A Tribe Called Quest, began referencing newly developed mobile technologies such as the pager. A Tribe Called Quest&#x27;s single &quot;Skypager&quot; directly speaks of the importance of such a wireless communication device, with group member Q-Tip stating that the Skypager &quot;serves an important communicative function for a young professional with a full calendar&quot;. Three 6 Mafia&#x27;s &quot;2-Way Freak,&quot; Sir Mix-A-Lot&#x27;s &quot;Beepers&quot; and &quot;Bug a Boo&quot; from Destiny&#x27;s Child also make reference to pagers.

Illicit drug dealers used pagers to great effect during the 1990s to conduct commerce, using them to arrange meetings with buyers. Associate superintendent for Miami-Dade County Public Schools in Florida Gul James Fleming once called them &quot;the most dominant symbol of the drug trade&quot; and schools have previously forbidden students from carrying them because of the ease with which they could be &quot;used to arrange illegal drug sales.&quot;

<text>The Central Criminal Court of England and Wales, commonly referred to as the Old Bailey after the street on which it stands, is a criminal court building in central London, one of several that house the Crown Court of England and Wales. The street outside follows the route of the ancient wall around the City of London, which was part of the fortification&#x27;s bailey, hence the metonymic name.

The court has been housed in a succession of buildings on the street since the sixteenth century, when it was attached to the medieval Newgate Prison. The current main building block was completed in 1902, designed by Edward William Mountford; its monumental architecture is recognised and protected as a Grade II* listed building. An extension, South Block, was constructed in 1972, over the former site of Newgate Prison which had been demolished in 1904.

The Crown Court sitting in the Old Bailey hears major criminal cases from within Greater London. In exceptional cases, trials may be referred to the Old Bailey from other parts of England and Wales. As with most courts in England and Wales, trials at the Old Bailey are open to the public, although they are subject to stringent security procedures.

==History==



The court originated as the sessions house of the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs of the City of London and of Middlesex. In addition to sessions court, the Old Bailey also held trials, similar to the travelling Courts of Assize held in other parts of England and Wales. The original medieval court is first mentioned in 1585; it was next to the older Newgate Prison, and seems to have grown out of the endowment to improve the gaol and rooms for the sheriffs, made possible by a gift from 15th-century Lord Mayor Richard Whittington. It was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666 and rebuilt in 1674, with the court open to the weather to prevent the spread of disease.

The building was re-fronted in 1734, so as to enclose the court and reduce the influence of spectators: this led to outbreaks of typhus, notably in 1750 when 60 people died, including the Lord Mayor and two judges. It was rebuilt again in 1774 and a second courtroom was added in 1824. Over 100,000 criminal trials were carried out at the Old Bailey between 1674 and 1834. In 1834, it was renamed from the Assize Court for London to the Central Criminal Court.

The court was envisaged as that where only criminals accused of crimes committed in the City and Middlesex were tried. However, in 1856, there was public revulsion at complaints sent to police against doctor William Palmer that he was a poisoner and murderer. This led to fears that he could not receive a fair trial in his native Staffordshire. The Central Criminal Court Act 1856 was passed to enable his trial, and others with a public profile, to be held at the Old Bailey. In London cant it was called &quot;The Gate&quot;, an abbreviation of Newgate.

The Old Bailey adjoined Newgate Prison until the jail&#x27;s 1902 closure. Hangings were a public spectacle in the street outside until May 1868. The condemned would be led along Dead Man&#x27;s Walk between the buildings, and many were buried in the walk itself. Large, rowdy crowds sometimes gathered and pelted the condemned with rotten fruit and vegetables and stones. Some sources claim that, after 28 people were crushed to death when a pie-seller&#x27;s stall overturned, a tunnel was made between the prison and St Sepulchre&#x27;s church opposite the crossroads, to allow the chaplain to minister to the condemned without having to force his way through crowds; but there are no known primary sources or photographic evidence that indicate that it actually existed.

The present building dates from 1902 and was officially opened by King Edward VII on 27 February 1907. It was designed by E. W. Mountford and co-occupies the site of the demolished prison. Above the main entrance is inscribed the admonition: &quot;Defend the Children of the Poor &amp; Punish the Wrongdoer&quot;.

On the dome above the court stands the court&#x27;s symbolic gilt bronze statue of Lady Justice by sculptor F. W. Pomeroy (made 1905–1906). She holds a sword in her right hand and the scales of justice in her left. The statue is popularly supposed to show blind Justice, but the figure is not blindfolded: the courthouse brochures explain that this is because Lady Justice was originally not blindfolded, and because her &quot;maidenly form&quot; is supposed to guarantee her impartiality which renders the blindfold redundant.

During the Blitz of the Second World War, the Old Bailey was bombed and severely damaged, but reconstruction work restored most of it in the early 1950s. In 1952, the restored interior of the Grand or Great Hall of the Central Criminal Court was once again open. This hall (underneath the dome) is decorated with paintings commemorating the Blitz, as well as quasi-historical scenes of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral with nobles outside. Running around the entire hall are a series of axioms, some of biblical reference. They read:

Between 1968 and 1972, a new South Block, designed by the architects Donald McMorran and George Whitby, was built to accommodate more modern courts.

In 1973, the Belfast Brigade of the Provisional IRA exploded a car bomb in the street outside, killing one and injuring 200 people. A shard of glass is preserved as a reminder, embedded in the wall at the top of the main stairs.

The hall (and its floor) was decorated with many busts and statues, chiefly of British monarchs, but also of legal figures, and those who achieved renown by campaigning for improvement in prison conditions from 1700 to 1900. This part of the building also housed the stenographers&#x27; offices until the stenographers were replaced by technology in March 2012. On 7 February 2024, around 1,500 people were forced to evacuate the building following a fire and reports of five separate explosions at the rear of the Central Criminal Court. Defendants on remand were returned to prison and juries were sent home.

==Management== 
Until 2017, the court manager was known by the title of the &quot;Secondary of the City of London&quot;, an ancient title of a City officer. His Majesty&#x27;s Courts and Tribunals Service manages the courts and administers the trials but the building itself is owned by the City of London Corporation, which finances the maintenance and running of the building and the staff costs out of their own resources.

==Judges==

All judges sitting in the Old Bailey are addressed as &quot;My Lord&quot; or &quot;My Lady&quot;, whether they are High Court, circuit judges or recorders. The Lord Mayor and aldermen of the City of London are entitled to sit on the judges&#x27; bench during a hearing but do not participate in hearings. Where a ceremonial tradition is followed, a judge, sitting solo, will sit off-centre in case the Lord Mayor should decide to come in, in which case they would take the centre chair. The most senior &quot;permanent&quot; judge of the Central Criminal Court has the title of Recorder of London, and their deputy has the title of Common Serjeant of London. The position of &quot;Recorder of London&quot; is distinct from that of a recorder, which is a part-time judicial office, holders of which sit part-time as judges of the Crown Court or County Court. The recent Recorders of London have been:

* 1975–1990 – Sir James Miskin
* 1990–1998 – Sir Lawrence Verney
* 1998–2004 – Michael Hyam
* 2004–2013 – Peter Beaumont
* 2013–2015 – Brian Barker
* 2015–2019 – Nicholas Hilliard
* 2020–present – Mark Lucraft

== Civic role ==

The court house originated as part of the City of London&#x27;s borough judicial system, and it remains so. The Recorder and the Common Serjeant are city officers, and the Recorder is a member of the Common Council because he is also a member of the Court of Aldermen. The city&#x27;s sheriffs and the Lord Mayor are justices there, but their jurisdiction is now nominal. The sheriffs are resident with the senior judges in the complex. Court 1 has benches set aside for the committee of City Bridge Foundation, the owner of the building.

==In popular culture==
The Old Bailey has been mentioned and featured in numerous fictional works including film, video games and literature. Notable examples include &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; and its film adaptation, in which the title character demolishes it to gain the public&#x27;s attention, and &quot;Justice League&quot; and its director&#x27;s cut, in which Wonder Woman foils a terrorist bomb plot. In Agatha Christie&#x27;s play, &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot;, the murder trial of Leonard Vole is held at the Old Bailey. It is also a central location in &quot;The Great Ace Attorney: Adventures&quot; and its sequel &quot;The Great Ace Attorney 2: Resolve&quot;, where many of the trials in the games&#x27; plot take place. &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot; is a British television series created and written by the British writer and barrister John Mortimer, in which Horace Rumpole, an elderly London barrister, defends a broad variety of clients, often underdogs. In &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;, upon defeating the police, the pirates declare that &quot;No pirate band will take its stand / At the Central Criminal Court.&quot;

<doc id="229047" wikidata="Q179100" url="?curid=229047" title="Enough (film)">
<text>Enough is a 2002 American psychological thriller film directed by Michael Apted, based on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestselling 1998 novel &quot;Black and Blue&quot;, by Anna Quindlen. It stars Jennifer Lopez as Slim, an abused wife who learns to fight back. The film was released theatrically in the United States on May 24, 2002 and grossed $51.8 million worldwide.

The film received largely negative reviews from critics and divisive audience reviews, with criticism over the film&#x27;s writing and excessive focus on melodramatic action and female empowerment over characterization, with particular reviews deeming the portrayal of domestic violence and character of Mitch as highly stereotypical. The film has been viewed more positively in retrospect, with both Lopez and Billy Campbell in particular receiving praise for their performances.

==Plot==
Slim is a waitress in a Los Angeles diner where she meets wealthy family man Mitch Hiller, who wards off a rude man trying to hit on her for a bet. They eventually marry, have a daughter named Gracie, and live happily in an expensive house.

Six years later, Slim discovers Mitch has been repeatedly cheating on her with no remorse. When she threatens to leave, he beats and threatens her. He insists that because he is the breadwinner, he can do whatever he likes, and he won&#x27;t end his affair unless she wants to fight him. Mitch warns her not to leave, stating that he refuses to live without her.

Slim goes to Mitch&#x27;s mother about the abuse. She consoles Slim briefly, but implies that Slim may have provoked Mitch&#x27;s reaction, and that he has a history of abuse. Her best friend Ginny advises her to leave him and press charges, but the police offer no help. After Mitch taunts Slim, revealing he knows who she has been talking to and has been watching by proxy, Slim sees no choice but to take Gracie and leave. She enlists her friends&#x27; help and tries to escape with Gracie late at night, but Mitch foils the plan and beats Slim again while threatening her friends at gunpoint. Mitch is forced to let them escape after they wake up Gracie, as he is unwilling to expose his true nature in front of her.

Mitch empties and freezes Slim&#x27;s bank accounts, leaving her unable to rent a room. Tracking her down at a cheap motel, he tries to break in, but she escapes with Gracie, moving to Seattle to stay with her ex-boyfriend Joe.

The next day, men posing as FBI agents show up and threaten Joe, damaging his apartment. Slim goes to her wealthy, estranged father, Jupiter. Even though Slim sent several unanswered letters to him as a child, Jupiter claims to have been unaware of her existence and believes she is just after money. Slim and Gracie briefly find refuge at a commune, where Jupiter later contacts her, revealing that Mitch&#x27;s associates have threatened him, causing him to be interested in helping her. He sends her a large sum of money, allowing her to set up a new life and identity, and tells her to reach out if she needs more.

Joe visits Slim in Michigan, but Mitch tracks her down with help from his cop friend Robbie, who had posed as the rude man in the staged altercation where Mitch and Slim first met, revealing that they had been conning women into sleeping with them for their personal gain. Slim narrowly escapes a struggle with Mitch who tries to kill her in a rage in front of Gracie after she further rejects him, as well as escaping from Robbie in a car chase.

Consulting a lawyer, she is warned there is little she can do, although he tells her the custody hearing is possibly a trick to lure her back to Mitch. Slim goes into hiding in San Francisco and sends Gracie away to safety while she trains in Krav Maga self-defense while enlisting the help of a woman who looks identical to her. She breaks into Mitch&#x27;s new home and hides his guns, jams the phone, plants fake letters saying she is there to discuss custody of Gracie and awaits his return. When he arrives they fight and Slim beats Mitch unconscious before she eventually knocks him off a balcony to his death. The police regard her actions as self-defense. Slim and Gracie reunite and go to live with Joe in Seattle.

==Production==
===Casting and filming===
&quot;Enough&quot;, produced by Columbia Pictures, is directed by Michael Apted and written by Nicholas Kazan. On November 9, 2000, &quot;New York Daily News&quot; reported that Lopez was in talks to star in &quot;Enough&quot;, &quot;which follows a newly married young woman&#x27;s descent into domestic violence after her dream man physically abuses her, causing her to go on the run&quot;. Sandra Bullock was originally cast to play Slim, a waitress. In November 2000 &quot;Variety&quot; magazine reported that Bullock had to back out of &quot;Enough&quot; because of a scheduling conflict with another film.

On May 19, 2001, it was reported that Lopez was cast as Slim, and &quot;Once and Again&quot; actor Billy Campbell was cast as Mitch, a &quot;wealthy contractor&quot; and Slim&#x27;s abusive husband. Juliette Lewis, Noah Wyle, Dan Futterman and Fred Ward were also announced to be co-starring in the film. According to Basham, filming began on May 21, 2001, and took place on location in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Port Townsend and Seattle. During a documentary featured on a special edition DVD of the film, Kazan said Lopez was &quot;very good&quot; at creating the character on the film &quot;through unscripted details, physical gestures and fiddling with props.&quot; He described her emotional acting as &quot;perfect pitch&quot;. Apted, who had heard rumors that Lopez was a diva, described her as &quot;fantastic&quot; and good to work with. He also noted Lopez was &quot;very much on the case, and that was very impressive.&quot;

In 2008, Lopez revealed that during the filming of &quot;Enough&quot;, she overworked and had a nervous breakdown: &quot;I was suffering from a lack of sleep. And I did have a kind of nervous breakdown. I froze up on set. Well, not on a set, but in my trailer. I was like, I don&#x27;t want to move, I don&#x27;t want to talk, I don&#x27;t want to do anything. It was on that movie, &quot;Enough&quot;. Yeah, I did. I had a nervous breakdown.&quot;

===Themes===

&quot;Enough&quot; is a thriller film that details an abusive relationship. Its writer Nicholas Kazan commented, &quot;About the worst aspect of the male psyche is that males have been taught, traditionally, to expect to get what they want. Much of the problems that men have, or the problems that men impose on women, have to do with feeling like they&#x27;re entitled, and that women should do what men want.&quot; Ryan J. Downey of MTV News wrote, &quot;Is America ready to see its favorite iced-up, well-manicured diva, Jennifer Lopez, all glammed-down and kicking ass as a battered wife?&quot;

Explaining the concept of the film, Lopez stated: &quot;There&#x27;s twists and turns and it&#x27;s exciting ... but it also has a message, which is what attracted me to it in the first place, which is an empowering thing.&quot; Describing its message, she said &quot;[If] you&#x27;re in these negative situations, negative relationships, whatever, you can get out ... The power to get out of those things is always within yourself. That&#x27;s the message of the movie.&quot; When Lopez read the script, she knew she was &quot;going to have to do [the] whole sequence at the end&quot; which featured an act that required her to &quot;become a believable lean, mean fighting machine.&quot;

Lopez then thought she should learn tai chi or taekwondo, but was worried about learning it at an expert level in a short time. Her trainer then suggested that she study Krav Maga, which, according to MTV News, is the &quot;official self-defense system of the Israeli Defense Forces which has recently become trendy in the States. The fighting style focuses on combating realistic scenarios with moves that are based on common, instinctual reactions.&quot; Talking about the system, Lopez said: &quot;[Krav Maga] levels out the playing field between men and women ... Where it doesn&#x27;t matter how big or tall or strong you are. You can actually maneuver around that. It&#x27;s about getting out of the way, counter-attacking and using whatever you can to get the upper hand.&quot;

During an interview with Lopez, discussing the resolution of the film, journalist Diane Sawyer of ABC News noted that people &quot;in the abuse counseling industry have said: you can&#x27;t tell women that; they can&#x27;t do that. That&#x27;s something that&#x27;s dangerous, even to see it in their minds.&quot; Lopez responded: &quot;...this is a movie that touches upon those themes, but really, it&#x27;s a thriller ... it&#x27;s about empowering yourself in any situation ... that you have. When I read the script, I saw it as: you have the power within yourself, no matter how severe the situation can be, to change whatever that is, to find that power within yourself to change any negative situation.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;Enough&quot; was planned to be released in September 2001, but was pushed back to &quot;early&quot; 2002. It was released on May 24, 2002. With a production budget of $38 million, its first run grossed $40 million domestically and a total of $51.8 million worldwide. After its opening week, &quot;Enough&quot; ranked at No. 5 on the American Box Office chart, grossing over $14 million screened across 2,623 theaters. The next week, it grossed $6.8 million, dropping to No. 7 at the box office, and grossed $3.7 million after its third week, falling to No. 9.

===Home media===
Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment released the DVD of &quot;Enough&quot; on October 8, 2002, in Dolby Digital English and French languages, as well as subtitles. A VHS edition was released on March 4, 2003. A special widescreen edition containing an aspect ratio of 2.40:1 was released on September 16, 2003; it also included Spanish language options. It has a range of extras which includes three deleted scenes: &quot;Strip Joint Break In&quot;, &quot;Enough Is Enough&quot; and &quot;Krav Maga: Contact Combat&quot;. Lopez&#x27;s music video for the song&#x27;s soundtrack &quot;Alive&quot; is also included.

During a &quot;making-of&quot; documentary for the film entitled &quot;Max on the Set: Enough&quot; Lopez stated she was attracted to &quot;Enough&quot; because it was &quot;like a female Rocky&quot;. Cynthia Fuchs from PopMatters wrote an in-depth review of the special edition DVD release, and said: &quot;Just why this film needs a second DVD release is unclear, except for the apparent diktat that there is no such thing as enough or even too much J-Lo&quot;.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 21% based on 126 reviews, with an average rating of 4.1/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Enough&quot; exploits the serious issue of spousal abuse to make an illogical, unintelligent thriller.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 25 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said Lopez &quot;holds the screen in a star performance that has less to do with acting than with embodying a forceful, streetwise woman who stands up for herself&quot;, while commenting that its preview had &quot;audience gasping&quot; and &quot;&quot;Enough&quot; does a better job than most movies of sustaining a mood of palpable physical menace, then confirming your worst fears&quot;. Alice King of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described the film&#x27;s plot as &quot;arduously nonsensical&quot; and felt that Lopez lacked connection with her on-screen daughter Tessa Allen, commenting that: &quot;All this to protect a helium-voiced little girl with whom Lopez has so little chemistry, it&#x27;s as if she&#x27;s handling garbage rather than a small child.&quot;

Blake French from Contactmusic.com was underwhelmed with the development of the film, and was critical that the film does not use Slim&#x27;s old friend and romantic interest enough, nor does it develop Slim&#x27;s real and adopted father figures while it &quot;uses the tiresome old &#x27;kid&#x27; cliché. Gracie is, as always, just old enough to understand the situation, but not quite old enough to make an actual impact in the story.&quot; French did praise Lopez in the end sequence, &quot;By the final scenes, despite their obviousness, I was as engrossed in the movie as I could have been, actually rooting for J. Lo to kick some bad guy butt&quot;.

Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote: &quot;Lopez has an image of being sexy and tough, but her appeal as an actress is that she&#x27;s down to earth and that her emotions are accessible. There&#x27;s nothing cold about her.&quot; Additionally, LaSalle felt that &quot;It&#x27;s the most tension-producing movie out there right now&quot;, stating that &quot;it has the biggest visceral kick, capable of inspiring blood lust in otherwise peaceful viewers.

ReelViews&#x27; James Berardinelli said &quot;Enough&quot; is director &quot;[Michael] Apted at his most commercial, and, unfortunately, his least compelling.&quot; Michael Atkinson of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; called Campbell the film&#x27;s &quot;primary power source&quot;, &quot;His steely gaze and overbearing quietude are forever tainted; &quot;Enough&quot; doesn&#x27;t stand a chance in Lifetime reruns&quot;.

Robert Koehler of &quot;Variety&quot; was negative: &quot;&quot;Enough&quot;, a thriller detailing how a good wife gets back at an evil, possessive husband, is never provocative enough to generate strong emotional response.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote how &quot;Enough&quot; was fundamentally similar to the 1978 exploitation flick &quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot; &quot;in which a man victimizes a woman for the first half of the film, and then the woman turns the tables in an extended sequence of graphic violence.&quot; Ebert also added: &quot;It&#x27;s surprising to see a director like Michael Apted and an actress like Jennifer Lopez associated with such tacky material.&quot;

Paula Nechack of the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; called &quot;Enough&quot; &quot;implausible and ugly&quot; and felt that it had already been done by actresses including Julia Roberts and Ashley Judd, and its script was &quot;more than enough of a mess to tarnish her box-office luster.&quot;

Maitland McDonagh of &quot;TV Guide&quot; reviewed the film negatively, but praised the ending sequence, &quot;If ever a movie was undermined by its packaging, it&#x27;s this formulaic thriller about a resourceful battered wife and the brutal husband who won&#x27;t let her go ... the entire promotional campaign is driven by the last 20 minutes, in which Slim becomes a lean, mean fighting machine and kicks the bastard&#x27;s ass&quot;.

Nathan Rabin of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; said &quot;the film&#x27;s idiocy works for Lopez: Every diva needs at least one camp classic on her résumé&quot;. Desson Thomson from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; emphasized his disappointment with the film, stating: &quot;In terms of actual social conscience, the movie gets a demagogic, rabble-rousing F. It also gets a failed grade for honest writing.&quot;

In retrospect the film has been viewed more positively. It has been called &quot;an underrated thriller&quot; and ranked among Lopez best films.

===Accolades===
Jennifer Lopez was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress for her performance in the film (as well as for &quot;Maid in Manhattan&quot;) but lost in a tie to both Madonna for &quot;Swept Away&quot; and Britney Spears for &quot;Crossroads&quot;.

==Soundtrack==

The official score for &quot;Enough&quot; was composed by David Arnold, and released by Audio CD on June 4, 2002. In addition to its score, Lopez recorded the song entitled &quot;Alive&quot;, which she co-wrote with her then-husband Cris Judd. Although it served as the song&#x27;s soundtrack and was used during the film, it does not appear on the film&#x27;s score.

<text>Ethel Margaret Campbell, Duchess of Argyll (&quot;née&quot; Whigham, formerly Sweeny; 1 December 1912 – 25 July 1993) was a Scottish heiress, socialite, and aristocrat who was most famous for her 1951 marriage and much-publicised 1963 divorce from her second husband, Ian Campbell, 11th Duke of Argyll.

==Early years==
Ethel Margaret Whigham was the only child of Helen Mann Hannay and George Hay Whigham. Her father, the son of Scottish lawyer and cricketer David Dundas Whigham, was chairman of the Celanese Corporation of Britain and North America. Her father George was a self-made millionaire, and although his father and mother were well-connected, they were not particularly wealthy. Margaret spent the first fourteen years of her life in New York City, where she was educated privately at the Hewitt School. Her beauty was much spoken of, and she had youthful romances with Prince Aly Khan, millionaire aviator Glen Kidston and publishing heir Max Aitken, later the second Lord Beaverbrook.

In 1928, the future actor David Niven, then 18, had sex with 15-year-old Margaret during a holiday at Bembridge on the Isle of Wight. To the fury of her father, she became pregnant as a result. She was taken into a London nursing home for a secret abortion. &quot;All hell broke loose,&quot; remembered her family cook, Elizabeth Duckworth. Margaret did not mention the episode in her 1975 memoirs, but she continued to adore Niven until the day he died. She was among the VIP guests at his London memorial service.

In 1930, Margaret was presented at Court in London and was known as the debutante of that year. Shortly afterwards, she announced her engagement to Charles Guy Fulke Greville, 7th Earl of Warwick. However, the wedding did not take place because she preferred Charles Francis Sweeny (1910–1993), an American businessman and amateur golfer from a wealthy Pennsylvania family. Her numerous early romances included an affair with Prince George, Duke of Kent.

==First marriage==

On 21 February 1933, following her conversion to Roman Catholicism, Margaret married Sweeny at the Brompton Oratory, London. Such had been the publicity surrounding her Norman Hartnell wedding dress that the traffic in Knightsbridge was blocked for three hours. For the rest of her life, Margaret was associated with glamour and elegance, being a firm client of Hartnell, Victor Stiebel, and Angele Delanghe in London before and after the Second World War. She was one of a series of society beauties photographed as classical figures by Madame Yevonde.

She had three children with Sweeny: a daughter, who was stillborn at eight months in late 1933; another daughter, Frances Helen (1937–2024; who married Charles Manners, 10th Duke of Rutland), and a son, Brian Charles (1940–2021). Before these pregnancies, she suffered eight miscarriages.

In 1943, Margaret had a near-fatal fall down a lift shaft. &quot;I fell forty feet to the bottom of the lift shaft&quot;, she later recalled. &quot;The only thing that saved me was the lift cable, which broke my fall. I must have clutched at it, for it was later found that all my fingernails were torn off. I apparently fell onto my knees and cracked the back of my head against the wall&quot;.

==Intermarital relationships==
The Sweenys divorced in 1947. After the end of her first marriage, Margaret was briefly engaged to a Texas-born banker, Joseph Thomas of Lehman Brothers, but he fell in love with another woman and the engagement was broken. She also had a serious romantic relationship with Theodore Rousseau, curator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, who was, she recalled, &quot;highly intelligent, witty and self-confident to the point of arrogance&quot;. That romance also ended without the couple formalising their liaison, since the mother of two &quot;feared that Ted was not &#x27;stepfather material&#x27;&quot;. Still, she observed in her memoirs, &quot;[W]e continued to see each other constantly.&quot;

==Second marriage==
On 22 March 1951, Margaret became the third wife of Ian Douglas Campbell, 11th Duke of Argyll. She wrote later in life:

Although, Margaret was not mentioned in Porter&#x27;s original version of &quot;You&#x27;re the Top&quot;, in the British version of the song adapted by P. G. Wodehouse, two lines were changed, and &quot;You&#x27;re an O&#x27;Neill drama / You&#x27;re Whistler&#x27;s mama&quot;, became &quot;You&#x27;re Mussolini / You&#x27;re &quot;Mrs Sweeny&quot;&quot;. 

According to Lyndsy Spence, a biographer of the Duchess, the Duke of Argyll forged a deed of sale (sometimes called a deed of gift, thus offering various items from Inveraray Castle as security) before their marriage in exchange for her money used to restore his family home at Inveraray, and wiretapped her car. The Duchess herself forged letters to sow doubt about the fatherhood of Ian Campbell, the Marquess of Lorne, and Lord Colin Campbell, her husband&#x27;s sons from his second marriage to Louise Timpson; and she even tried to acquire a newborn baby she could pass off as her husband&#x27;s rightful heir.

==Divorce from the Duke of Argyll==
Within a few years, the marriage was falling apart. The Duke was known to be addicted to alcohol, gambling and prescription drugs, and was described as physically violent and emotionally abusive by his first two wives, whose money he tried to use to maintain Inveraray Castle. He suspected the Duchess of infidelity and, while she was in New York, engaged a locksmith to break open a cupboard at their Mayfair home, 48 Upper Grosvenor Street. The evidence discovered resulted in the 1963 divorce case, in which the Duke accused his wife of infidelity and included a set of Polaroid photographs of the Duchess naked, save for her signature three-strand pearl necklace, in the company of another man. There were also photographs of the Duchess fellating a naked man whose face was not shown. It was speculated that this &quot;headless man&quot; was the Minister of Defence Duncan Sandys (later Lord Duncan-Sandys, former son-in-law of Winston Churchill), who offered to resign from the cabinet.

The Duchess counter-petitioned the divorce, accusing the Duke of committing adultery with her stepmother, Jane Corby Whigham. She dropped her case the day of the hearing due to lack of a witness, and later had to pay a judgment of £25,000 to her stepmother, who sued her for libel, slander, and conspiracy to suborn perjury. 

A list of as many as 88 men with whom the Duke believed his wife had consorted was produced. The list is said to include two government ministers and three members of the British royal family. The judge commented that the Duchess had indulged in &quot;disgusting sexual activities&quot;. Lord Denning, who was called upon by the government to track down the &quot;headless man&quot;, compared the handwriting of the five leading &quot;suspects&quot;, (Duncan Sandys; Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.; John Cohane, an American businessman; Peter Combe, a former press officer at the Savoy Hotel; and Sigismund von Braun, brother of the German scientist Wernher von Braun) with the captions written on the photographs. It is claimed that this analysis proved that the man in question was Fairbanks, then long married to his second wife, but this was not made public. 

Granting the divorce, Lord Wheatley, the presiding judge, said the evidence established that the Duchess &quot;was a completely promiscuous woman whose sexual appetite could only be satisfied with a number of men&quot;. He continued: &quot;Her attitude to the sanctity of marriage was what moderns would call &#x27;enlightened&#x27; but which in plain language was wholly immoral.&quot; Many of the men the Duchess was alleged to have slept with were homosexual; she was unwilling to divulge this as sexual acts between men were illegal in the United Kingdom at the time.

The Duchess never revealed the identity of the &quot;headless man&quot;, and Fairbanks always denied the allegation. Long afterwards, it was claimed that there were actually two &quot;headless men&quot; in the photographs, Fairbanks and Sandys, the latter identified on the basis of the Duchess&#x27;s statement that &quot;the only Polaroid camera in the country at that time had been lent to the Ministry of Defence&quot;. In 2013, the daughter-in-law of the 11th Duke, Lady Colin Campbell, stated that the &quot;headless man&quot; was an American executive named Bill Lyons.

==Final years==

The Duchess wrote a memoir, &quot;Forget Not&quot; (published by W. H. Allen Ltd in 1975) which was reviewed negatively for its name-dropping and air of entitlement. She also lent her name as author to a guide to entertaining. With her fortune diminished, she opened her London house at 48 Upper Grosvenor Street, which had been decorated for her parents in 1935 by Syrie Maugham, for paid tours. Her extravagant lifestyle and ill-considered investments left her largely penniless by the time she died.

In 1978, Margaret&#x27;s debts forced her to move from Upper Grosvenor Street and relocate with her maid to a suite at the Grosvenor House Hotel. In April 1988, on the evening after the Grand National, she appeared on a Channel 4 &quot;After Dark&quot; discussion about horse racing &quot;so she said, to put the point of view of the horse&quot;, later walking out of the programme &quot;because she was so very sleepy&quot;. In 1990, unable to pay the hotel bills, she was evicted and, with the support of friends and her first husband, moved into an apartment. 
Margaret&#x27;s children later placed her in a nursing home in Pimlico, London. The Duchess died in penury in 1993 after a bad fall in the nursing home. Her funeral, a requiem mass, was held at Church of the Immaculate Conception, Farm Street in Mayfair. She was buried alongside her first husband, Charles Sweeny, who had died only four months earlier, in Brookwood Cemetery in Woking, Surrey.

Margaret had asked Charles Castle in 1974 to write her biography. He then published &quot;The Duchess Who Dared – The Life of Margaret, Duchess of Argyll&quot; in 1994. It was reprinted in 1995 by Pan Books, and in 2021, to coincide with the TV series &quot;A Very British Scandal&quot;, by Swift Press.

==Personality==
The Duchess once told &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;I don&#x27;t think anybody has real style or class any more. Everyone&#x27;s got old and fat.&quot; She described herself as &quot;always vain&quot;. Another quote gives an insight into her personality: &quot;Always a poodle, only a poodle! That, and three strands of pearls!&quot; she said. &quot;Together they are absolutely the essential things in life.&quot;

==In popular culture==
*&quot;Powder Her Face&quot;, a chamber opera based on major events in the Duchess&#x27;s life, received its premiere at the Cheltenham Music Festival in 1995. The English composer Thomas Adès wrote the music, and novelist Philip Hensher contributed the libretto; the Festival, along with the Almeida Opera, commissioned the piece. The opera&#x27;s Duchess character, an image of the real woman refracted through an astringent camp sensibility, invites both sympathy and contempt for her by design.
* Her divorce from the Duke of Argyll was dramatised in the BBC/Amazon Studios miniseries &quot;A Very British Scandal&quot;, written by Sarah Phelps and broadcast in 2021, starring Claire Foy as the Duchess.

<doc id="229052" wikidata="Q14138" url="?curid=229052" title="Qilin">
<text>The qilin ( ; ) is a legendary hooved chimerical creature that appears in Chinese mythology, and is said to appear with the imminent arrival or death of a sage or illustrious ruler. Qilin are a specific type of the mythological family of one-horned beasts. The qilin also appears in the mythologies of other Chinese-influenced cultures.

== Origins ==
The earliest mention of the mythical qilin is in the poem included in the Classic of Poetry (11th – 7th c. BCE). &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals&quot; mentioned that a &quot;lin&quot; () was captured in the 14th year of Duke Ai of Lu () (481 CE); &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot; credited Confucius with identifying the &quot;lin&quot; as such.

The bisyllabic form &quot;qilin&quot; ( ~ ), which carries the same generic meaning as &quot;lin&quot; alone, is attested in works dated to the Warring States period (475–221 BCE). &quot;Qi&quot; denotes the male and &quot;lin&quot; denotes the female according to &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot;.

The legendary image of the qilin became associated with the image of the giraffe in the Ming dynasty. The identification of the qilin with giraffes began after Zheng He&#x27;s 15th-century voyage to East Africa (landing, among other places, in modern-day Somalia). The Ming Dynasty bought giraffes from the Somali merchants along with zebras, incense, and various other exotic animals. Zheng He&#x27;s fleet brought back two giraffes to Nanjing and they were mistaken by the emperor for the mythical creature, with meaning giraffe in Somali. The identification of qilin with giraffes has had a lasting influence: even today, the same word is used for the mythical animal and the giraffe in both Korean and Japanese.

Axel Schuessler reconstructs Old Chinese pronunciation of as *&quot;gərin&quot;. Finnish linguist Juha Janhunen tentatively compares *&quot;gərin&quot; to an etymon reconstructed as *&quot;kalimV&quot;, denoting &quot;whale&quot;; and represented in the language isolate Nivkh and four different language families Tungusic, Mongolic, Turkic and Samoyedic, wherein *&quot;kalay(ә)ng&quot; means &quot;whale&quot; (in Nenets) and *&quot;kalVyǝ&quot; &quot;mammoth&quot; (in Enets and Nganasan). As even aborigines &quot;vaguely familiar with the underlying real animals&quot; often confuse the whale, mammoth, and unicorn: they conceptualized the mammoth and whale as aquatic, as well as the mammoth and unicorn possessing a single horn; for inland populations, the extant whale &quot;remains... an abstraction, in this respect being no different from the extinct mammoth or the truly mythical unicorn.&quot; However, Janhunen cautiously remarks that &quot;[t]he formal and semantic similarity between *&quot;kilin&quot; &lt; *&quot;gilin&quot; ~ *&quot;gïlin&quot; &#x27;unicorn&#x27; and *&quot;kalimV&quot; &#x27;whale&#x27; (but also Samoyedic *&quot;kalay&quot;- &#x27;mammoth&#x27;) is sufficient to support, though perhaps not confirm, the hypothesis of an etymological connection&quot;, and also notes a possible connection between Old Chinese and Mongolian (*)&quot;kers&quot; ~ (*)&quot;keris&quot; ~ (*)&quot;kiris&quot; &quot;rhinoceros&quot; (Khalkha: ).

==Description==

Qilin generally have Chinese dragon-like features: similar heads with antlers, eyes with thick eyelashes, manes that always flow upward, and beards. The body is fully or partially scaled and often shaped like an ox, deer, or horse, or more commonly a goat. They are always shown with cloven hooves. While dragons in China (and thus qilin) are also most commonly depicted as golden, qilin may be of any color or even various colors, and can be depicted as bejeweled or exhibiting a jewel-like brilliance.

The qilin is depicted throughout a wide range of Chinese art, sometimes with parts of their bodies on fire.

Legends tell that qilin have appeared in the garden of the legendary Yellow Emperor and in the capital of Emperor Yao; both events bore testimony to the benevolent nature of the rulers. It has also been told that the birth of the great sage Confucius was foretold by the arrival of a qilin.

===Qilin as unicorns===
In modern times, the depictions of qilin have often fused with the Western concept of unicorns, and qilin () is often translated into English as &quot;unicorn&quot;. The Han dynasty dictionary &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot; describes &quot;qi&quot; as single-horned, and it can sometimes be depicted as having a single horn. The translation, however, may be misleading, as qilin can also be depicted as having two horns. In modern Chinese, &quot;one-horned beast&quot; () is used for &quot;unicorns&quot;. A number of different Chinese mythical creatures can be depicted with a single horn, and a qilin depicted with one horn may be called a &quot;one-horned qilin&quot; in Chinese.

Nevertheless, the mythical and etymological connections between the creatures have been noted by various cultural studies and even the Chinese government, which has minted silver, gold, and platinum commemorative coins depicting both archetypal creatures.

==Other cultural representations==

=== East Asia ===

==== Japan ====
Kirin, which has also come to be used as the modern Japanese word for a giraffe, are similar to qilin. Japanese art tends to depict the kirin as more deer-like than in Chinese art. Alternatively, it is depicted as a dragon shaped like a deer, but with an ox&#x27;s tail instead of a lion&#x27;s tail. They are also often portrayed as partially unicorn-like in appearance, but with a backwards curving horn.

==== Korea ====
Girin or kirin () is the Korean form of qilin. It is described as a maned creature with the torso of a deer, an ox tail with the hooves of a horse. The girin were initially depicted as more deer-like, however over time they have transformed into more horse-like. They were one of the four divine creatures along with the dragon, phoenix, and turtle. Girin were extensively used in Korean royal and Buddhist arts.

In modern Korean, the term &quot;girin&quot; is used for &quot;giraffe&quot;.

===Southeast Asia===
==== Thailand ====
In Thailand, the qilin is known as &quot;&quot; (), and is a member of the pantheon of Thai Himapant forest mythical animals. It is most probable that the Gilen was introduced into the pantheon under the influence of the Tai Yai who came down from Southern China to settle in Siam in ancient times, and the legend was probably incorporated into the Himapant legends of Siam in this manner. The Gilen is a mixture of various animals, which come from differing elemental environments, representing elemental magical forces present within each personified creature. Many of the Himapant animals actually represent gods and devas of the Celestial Realms, and bodhisattvas, who manifest as personifications which represent the true nature of each creature deity through the symbolism of the various body parts amalgamated into the design of the Mythical creature.

In &quot;Phra Aphai Mani&quot;, the masterpiece epic poem of Sunthorn Phu, a renowned poet of the 18th century. There is a monster that is Sudsakorn&#x27;s steed, one of the main characters in the epic. This creature was called &quot;Ma Nin Mangkorn&quot; (, &quot;ceylonite dragon horse&quot;), it is depicted as it has diamond fangs, ceylonite scales, and a birthmark on the tongue. It was a mixture of horse, dragon, deer antlers, fish scales, and Phaya Nak tail, with has black sequins all over. Its appearance resembles a qilin.

<text>In mathematics and computer science, truncation is limiting the number of digits right of the decimal point.

== Truncation and floor function ==

Truncation of positive real numbers can be done using the floor function. Given a number formula_1 to be truncated and formula_2, the number of elements to be kept behind the decimal point, the truncated value of x is
:formula_3

However, for negative numbers truncation does not round in the same direction as the floor function: truncation always rounds toward zero, the formula_4 function rounds towards negative infinity. For a given number formula_5, the function formula_6 is used instead
:formula_7.

== Causes of truncation ==
With computers, truncation can occur when a decimal number is typecast as an integer; it is truncated to zero decimal digits because integers cannot store non-integer real numbers.

== In algebra ==
An analogue of truncation can be applied to polynomials. In this case, the truncation of a polynomial &quot;P&quot; to degree &quot;n&quot; can be defined as the sum of all terms of &quot;P&quot; of degree &quot;n&quot; or less. Polynomial truncations arise in the study of Taylor polynomials, for example.

<text>In medicine and the social sciences, a young adult is generally a person in the years following adolescence, sometimes with some overlap. Definitions and opinions on what qualifies as a young adult vary, with works such as Erik Erikson&#x27;s stages of human development significantly influencing the definition of the term; generally, the term is often used to refer to adults in approximately the age range of 18 to 45 years. Some inclusive definitions extend the range into the early to mid 40s, while others end earlier.

The United States Census Bureau, for instance, defines young adults as those between the ages of 18 and 32. (As of 2024): Over 65 million Americans born approximately from 1990 to 2006, would likely fall under this category. The young adult stage in human development precedes middle adulthood.

The phrase &quot;young adult&quot; is frequently used to market young adult novels to readers in the literary industry of young adult literature. These are books targeted at children down to ages 13 or 14. This broad extension of &quot;young adult&quot; to minors has been disputed, as they are not considered adults by the law or in most cultures, outside of religion (such as the Bar or Bat Mitzvah in Judaism), and the tradition of &quot;biological&quot; adulthood beginning at puberty has become archaic.

This period imposes many challenges in the health and well being, as well as psychological development of humans.

==Time co-ordinates==
For a variety of reasons, timelines on young adulthood cannot be exactly defined—producing different results according to the different mix of overlapping indices (legal, maturational, occupational, sexual, emotional, and the like) employed, or on whether a &quot;developmental perspective&quot;... [or] the &quot;socialization perspective&quot; is taken. &#x27;Sub-phases in this timetable of psycho-social growth patterns... are not rigid, and both social change and individual variations must be taken into account&#x27;—not to mention regional and cultural differences. Arguably indeed, with people living longer, and also reaching puberty earlier, &#x27;age norms for major life events have become highly elastic&#x27; by the twenty-first century. Due to generational changes, the pathway for young adults to fulfill their adult responsibilities has become less predictable. With growing changes in college education costs, living arrangements, and work and education opportunities, young adults are experiencing various life transitions in many stages of adulthood rather than one stage itself.

Some have suggested that after ″&quot;Pre-adulthood&quot;... in the first 20 years or so... the second era, &quot;Early Adulthood&quot;, lasts from about age 17 to 45... the adult era of greatest energy and abundance and of greatest contradiction and stress.&#x27; Within that framework, &#x27;the &quot;Early Adult Transition&quot; (17–22) is a developmental bridge between pre-adulthood and early adulthood&#x27;, recognizing that &#x27;the transition into adulthood is not a clear-cut dividing line&#x27;. One might alternatively speak of &#x27;a &quot;Provisional Adulthood (18–30)&quot;... [&amp;] the initiation to First Adulthood&#x27; as following that. Alternatively, MIT has generally defined &quot;young adulthood&quot; as 18 to 22 or 18 to 25, although this is likely to align with the typical age range of college students.

Despite all such fluidity, there is broad agreement that it is essentially the twenties and thirties that constitute ″&quot;Early adulthood&quot;... the basis for what Levinson calls &quot;the Dream&quot;—a vision of his [or her] goals in life which provide motivation and enthusiasm for the future.&#x27;

==Health==
Young/prime adulthood can be considered the healthiest time of life and young adults are generally in good health, subject neither to disease nor the problems of senescence. Strength and physical performance reach their peak from 18 to 46 years of age. Flexibility may decrease with age throughout adulthood.

As teens transition into young adulthood, engagement in risky behavior may be noticeable, which may result in health risks such as &quot;unintended injury, unprotected sex, violence, binge drinking, motor vehicle incidents, suicide, and poor diet and nutrition.&quot; 75% of deaths during the young adult years are due to risky behavior or mental health crises leading to suicide. In developed countries, mortality rates for the 18–45 age group are typically very low. Men are more likely to die at this age than women, particularly in the 18–25 group: reasons include car accidents and suicide. Mortality statistics among men and women level off during the late twenties and thirties, due in part to good health and less risk-taking behavior.

There has been an increase in the presence of mental illness among young adults globally. This increase has been linked to factors such as diet and exercise. Those dealing with the effects of mental illness are more likely to indulge in food that lacks nutrients and is high in sugar, salt, and fats. Mental illnesses and risk taking behaviors correlate to the transition between the teen years and adulthood. 

Regarding disease, cancer is much less common in young than in older adults. Exceptions are testicular cancer, cervical cancer, and Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma.

In sub-Saharan Africa, HIV/AIDS has hit the early adult population particularly hard. According to a United Nations report, AIDS has significantly increased mortality between ages 20 to 55 for African males and 20 to 45 for African females, reducing the life expectancy in South Africa by 18 years and in Botswana by 34 years.

==Erik Erikson&#x27;s theories of early adulthood==
According to Erik Erikson, in the wake of the adolescent emphasis upon identity formation, &#x27;the young adult, emerging from the search for and insistence on identity, is eager and willing to fuse their identity with that of others. He [or she] is ready for intimacy, that is, the capacity to commit... to concrete affiliations and partnerships.&#x27; To do so means the ability &#x27;to face the fear of ego loss in situations which call for self-abandon: in the solidarity of close affiliations, in orgasms and sexual unions, in close friendships and in physical combat&#x27;. Avoidance of such experiences &#x27;because of a fear of ego-loss may lead to a deep sense of isolation and consequent self-absorption&#x27;.

Where isolation is avoided, the young adult may find instead that &#x27;satisfactory sex relations... in some way take the edge off the hostilities and potential rages caused by the oppositeness of male and female, of fact and fancy, of love and hate&#x27;; and may grow into the ability to exchange intimacy, love, and compassion.

In modern societies, young adults in their late teens and early 20s encounter a number of issues as they finish school and begin to hold full-time jobs and take on other responsibilities of adulthood; and &#x27;the young adult is usually preoccupied with self-growth in the context of society and relationships with others.&#x27; The danger is that in &#x27;the second era, &quot;Early Adulthood&quot;... we must make crucially important choices regarding marriage, family, work, and lifestyle before we have the maturity or life experience to choose wisely.&#x27;

While &#x27;young adulthood is filled with avid quests for intimate relationships and other major commitments involving career and life goals&#x27;, there is also &quot;a parallel pursuit for the formulation of a set of moral values&quot;. Erikson has argued that it is only now that what he calls the &#x27;ideological mind&#x27; of adolescence gives way to &#x27;that &quot;ethical sense&quot; which is the mark of the adult.&#x27;

Reaching adulthood in modern society is not always a linear or clean transition. As generations continue to adapt, new markers of adulthood are created that add different social expectations of what it means to be an adult.

==Daniel Levinson&#x27;s theory of adult development==

Daniel Levinson argued that developmental sequences continue to occur as we transition into adulthood. Levinson&#x27;s theory centers around Erik Erikson&#x27;s conception of life courses. This theory of Erikson includes patterns and relationships of events in the person&#x27;s life that distinguishes them. The study of life courses covers all aspects of life relationships, internal and external feelings, bodily changes, and the good and bad times that are experienced. Preadulthood, Early Adulthood, Middle Adulthood, and Late Adulthood are the four eras that constitute the life course. Preadulthood begins with conception and continues to roughly the age of 22. During these years the person grows from being extremely dependent and undifferentiated to being a more independent responsible adult. This is the era in that we see the most biopsychosocial growth. The Early Adulthood Transition is part of this first stage while also being a part of the second stage, which is from the age of 17 to 22. Here is when the pre-adulthood era begins to draw to a close and the transition to early adulthood begins. It is here that the individual begins to modify their relationship from the pre-adult world so that they fit better to the adult world they are creating. The second era Early adulthood begins at age 17 and goes till 45. It begins during the early adulthood transition and has the greatest amount of energy, contradiction, and stress. This is typically the time for pursuing ambitions and aspirations, finding a place in society, forming families, strengthening relationships and as the era ends establishing a solid position in the adult world. The third period (Middle Adulthood) begins at age 45 and goes till 65, here we begin to see a decline in our biological capacities and mental faculties, though this decline is not enough to completely deplete us of the energy we had during early adulthood and it still allows us to continue to have a socially valuable life. The final era is late adulthood which begins at age 65 and ends with death. In this era, the individual has to find a new balance between involvement with society and the self. An individuals health begins to deteriorate at an increased, albeit varying rate, as such they should be given the ability to freely choose the mode in which they live their lives.

==Settling down==
After the relative upheaval of the early 30s, the middle to late 30s is often characterized by settling down: &#x27;the establishment phase&#x27;, involving &#x27;what we would call &quot;major life investments&quot;—work, family, friends, community activities, and values.&#x27; After making major investments in life, individuals make deeper commitments and thus pursue them with increased determination. What has been termed &#x27;the &quot;Culminating Life Structure for Early Adulthood&quot; (33–40) is the vehicle for completing this era and realizing our youthful aspirations.&#x27; People in their thirties may increase the financial and emotional investments they make in their lives, and may have been employed long enough to gain promotions and raises. They often become more focused on advancing their careers and gaining stability in their personal lives—&#x27;with marriage and child-rearing,&#x27; starting a family, coming to the fore as priorities.

Gail Sheehy, however, signposts the same twenties/thirties division differently, arguing that &#x27;the twenties have stretched out into a long Provisional Adulthood&#x27;, and that in fact &#x27;the transition to the Turbulent Thirties marks the initiation to First Adulthood.&#x27;

==Midlife transition==

Young adulthood then draws to its close with &#x27;the &quot;Midlife Transition&quot;, from roughly age 46 to 50&#x27;—producing &#x27;a brand-new passage in the forties, when First Adulthood ends and Second Adulthood begins.&#x27; In the midlife transition, early adulthood often ends, and individuals make changes in their lives, such as in their career. The end of early adulthood can be defined as when a person stops seeking adult status or wanting to feel like an adult. When people reach the midlife transition, they shift from talking about how old they are to bolster their reputation and emphasize how young they are. In the midlife transition, individuals focus more on the present than the future and the past. In this transitional period from early to middle adulthood, individuals tend to focus less on themselves and more on their relationships. In addition, individuals experience physical changes which may then subsequently necessitate a change in regards to their perceived body image.

Levinson thought of the midlife as a time of crisis. However, recent research shows that midlife crisis is not a general experience. Instead, individuals report their midlife to be an open and free period of life. In the midlife transition, the issue is not whether the individual has achieved or failed in accomplishing the goals they formed in the previous era. Rather the issue at hand is what the individual should be doing with the experience of disparity between their goals and outcomes.

<doc id="229059" wikidata="Q281917" url="?curid=229059" title="Women's PGA Championship">
<text>The Women&#x27;s PGA Championship (branded as the KPMG Women&#x27;s PGA Championship for sponsorship reasons) is a women&#x27;s professional golf tournament. First held in 1955, it is one of five majors on the LPGA Tour. It is not recognized as a major by the Ladies European Tour, which does not recognize any of the three majors played in the United States.

Formerly known as the LPGA Championship, the LPGA (Ladies Professional Golf Association) announced in 2014 that the PGA of America would become a partner of the event, and that it would be renamed the Women&#x27;s PGA Championship beginning in 2015—becoming a sister event to the men&#x27;s PGA Championship (in a similar manner to the U.S. Women&#x27;s Open being a sister event to the men&#x27;s U.S. Open). The partnership included a new title sponsorship agreement with KPMG, an increase in purse, and a commitment by NBC to provide network television coverage of the weekend rounds.

The PGA of America partnership also allowed the tournament to be held at various top courses around the United States. Previously, the LPGA Championship had been usually held at a consistent location each year, most recently near Rochester, New York as part of a title sponsorship agreement with Western New York–based supermarket chain Wegmans.

==Professional-amateur controversy==
Prior to 2005, the LPGA Championship had a &quot;professionals only&quot; rule. This is similar to the men&#x27;s PGA Championship, but contrasts with the U.S. and British Opens, which have long had both amateur and professional entrants through qualifying (henceforth the term &quot;open&quot;). Until its takeover by the PGA of America in 2015, the tournament was the LPGA&#x27;s own event, and the LPGA was created specifically to provide opportunities for women in professional golf.

In 2005 this rule was revoked, effectively to allow 15-year-old amateur Michelle Wie to compete, in order to attract more media coverage and sell more tickets, though this was not publicly acknowledged by the LPGA. Some professionals objected to this move, as they felt that places given to amateurs would come at the expense of the LPGA Tour&#x27;s less successful professionals, who need to play regularly to make a living. One of the leading professionals, Laura Davies, stated objections to the change were shortsighted.

At the time, Wie had made the cut in all five majors that she had played, with two top-ten finishes, and had also played twice in the Sony Open in Hawaii on the PGA Tour, but missed both cuts. Despite the controversy, she outscored all but one of the pros in the 2005 LPGA Championship and was the runner-up, three strokes behind three-time champion Annika Sörenstam.

In 2006, the LPGA Championship reverted to its &quot;professionals only&quot; status, with only pros in the field. Wie had turned professional the previous October, upon signing multimillion-dollar endorsement contracts with Nike, Sony, and other sponsors.

Through 2022, three consecutive championships has been achieved only twice, by Sörenstam (2005) and Park (2015).

==Sites by state==
==Future sites==
Since the PGA of America took control of the tournament in 2015, venues will often bid for both a men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s, and seniors&#x27; PGA Championship together. Aronimink Golf Club, which hosted the men&#x27;s in 1962 and seniors in 2003, was awarded a joint bid for the 2020 women&#x27;s and 2027 men&#x27;s. Congressional Country Club was awarded the 2025 seniors and both the 2022 and 2027 women&#x27;s championships. Baltusrol Golf Club, which had hosted the 2005 and 2016 men&#x27;s championships, was awarded the 2023 women&#x27;s and 2029 men&#x27;s championships together. The tournament will also be held at the PGA of America&#x27;s new home in Frisco, Texas.

<text>Old age is the range of ages for people nearing and surpassing life expectancy. People who are of old age are also referred to as: old people, elderly, elders, senior citizens, seniors or older adults. Old age is not a definite biological stage: the chronological age denoted as &quot;old age&quot; varies culturally and historically. Some disciplines and domains focus on the aging and the aged, such as the organic processes of aging (senescence), medical studies of the aging process (gerontology), diseases that afflict older adults (geriatrics), technology to support the aging society (gerontechnology), and leisure and sport activities adapted to older people (such as senior sport).

Older people often have limited regenerative abilities and are more susceptible to illness and injury than younger adults. They face social problems related to retirement, loneliness, and ageism.

In 2011, the United Nations proposed a human-rights convention to protect old people.

==History==
===European===

The history of old age in the History of Europe has been characterized by several prominent features across the last 3000 years:

* Consistent age threshold: The chronological threshold for old age has remained consistent throughout European history, typically ranging from 60 to 70 years. This definition has persisted from antiquity to modern times, despite overwhelming social and economic changes.
* Legal and cultural recognition: Old age was always recognized in legal and cultural contexts. The laws often included precise age-based exclusions or provisions for the elderly. Cultural representations, such as the division of the life cycle into age-defined stages, were common and often adapted from earlier Greek, Roman, and Egyptian traditions.
* Varied experiences: Old age was a highly diverse experience, encompassing individuals from different classes and socioeconomic backgrounds, political status, levels of fitness, and degrees of power. 
* Changing status: The status of the elderly has varied across different periods. For instance, during the early Middle Ages (5th to 10th centuries), old age gained a more favorable status, particularly for older men, based on the moral worth associated with this life stage and Christian attitudes.

==Definitions==

Current definitions of old age include official definitions, sub-group definitions, and four dimensions as follows.

===Official definitions===
Most developed Western countries set the retirement age around the age of 65; this is also generally considered to mark the transition from middle to old age. Reaching this age is commonly a requirement to become eligible for senior social programs.

Old age cannot be universally defined because it is context-sensitive. The United Nations, for example, considers old age to be 60 years or older. In contrast, a 2001 joint report by the U.S. National Institute on Aging and the World Health Organization [WHO] Regional Office for Africa set the beginning of old age in Sub-Saharan Africa at 50. This lower threshold stems primarily from a different way of thinking about old age in developing nations. Unlike in the developed world, where chronological age determines retirement, societies in developing countries determine old age according to a person&#x27;s ability to make active contributions to society. This number is also significantly affected by lower life expectancy throughout the developing world. Dating back to the Middle Ages and prior, what certain scholars thought of as old age varied depending on the context, but the state of being elderly was often thought as being 60 years of age or older in many respects.

===Sub-group definitions===
Gerontologists have recognized that people experience very different conditions as they approach old age. In developed countries, many people in their later 60s and 70s (frequently called &quot;early old age&quot;) are still fit, active, and able to care for themselves. However, after age 80, they generally become increasingly frail, a condition marked by serious mental and physical debilitation.

Therefore, rather than lumping together all people who have been defined as old, some gerontologists have recognized the diversity of old age by defining sub-groups. One study distinguishes the young-old (60 to 69), the middle-old (70 to 79), and the very old (80+). Another study&#x27;s sub-grouping is young-old (65 to 74), middle-old (75 to 84), and oldest-old (85+). A third sub-grouping is young-old (65 to 74), old (74 to 84), and old-old (85+). Describing sub-groups in the 65+ population enables a more accurate portrayal of significant life changes.

Two British scholars, Paul Higgs and Chris Gilleard, have added a &quot;fourth age&quot; sub-group. In British English, the &quot;third age&quot; is &quot;the period in life of active retirement, following middle age&quot;. Higgs and Gilleard describe the fourth age as &quot;an arena of inactive, unhealthy, unproductive, and ultimately unsuccessful ageing&quot;.

===Dimensions===
&quot;Key Concepts in Social Gerontology&quot; lists four dimensions: chronological, biological, psychological, and social. Wattis and Curran add a fifth dimension: developmental. Chronological age may differ considerably from a person&#x27;s functional age. The distinguishing marks of old age normally occur in all five senses at different times and at different rates for different people. In addition to chronological age, people can be considered old because of the other dimensions of old age. For example, people may be considered old when they become grandparents or when they begin to do less or different work in retirement.

===Senior citizen===
Senior citizen is a common euphemism for an old person used in American English, and sometimes in British English. It implies that the person being referred to is retired. This in turn usually implies that the person is over the retirement age, which varies according to country. Synonyms include old age pensioner or pensioner in British English, and retiree and senior in American English. Some dictionaries describe widespread use of &quot;senior citizen&quot; for people over the age of 65.

When defined in a legal context, &quot;senior citizen&quot; is often used for legal or policy-related reasons in determining who is eligible for certain benefits available to the age group.

It is used in general usage instead of traditional terms such as &quot;old person&quot;, &quot;old-age pensioner&quot;, or &quot;elderly&quot; as a courtesy and to signify continuing relevance of and respect for this population group as &quot;citizens&quot; of society, of senior &quot;rank&quot;.

The term was apparently coined in 1938 during a political campaign. Famed caricaturist Al Hirschfeld claimed on several occasions that his father Isaac Hirschfeld invented the term &quot;senior citizen&quot;. It has come into widespread use in recent decades in legislation, commerce, and common speech. Especially in less formal contexts, it is often abbreviated as &quot;senior(s)&quot;, which is also used as an adjective.

====Age qualifications====
The age of 65 has long been considered the benchmark for senior citizenship in numerous countries. This convention originated from Chancellor Otto von Bismarck&#x27;s introduction of the pension system in Germany during the late 19th century. Bismarck&#x27;s legislation set the retirement age at 70, with 65 as the age at which individuals could start receiving a pension. This age standard gradually gained acceptance in other nations and has since become deeply entrenched in public consciousness.

The age which qualifies for senior citizen status varies widely. In governmental contexts, it is usually associated with an age at which pensions or medical benefits for the elderly become available. In commercial contexts, where it may serve as a marketing device to attract customers, the age is often significantly lower.

In commerce, some businesses offer customers of a certain age a &quot;senior discount&quot;. The age at which these discounts are available varies from 55, 60, 62 or 65 upwards, and other criteria may also apply. Sometimes a special &quot;senior discount card&quot; or other proof of age needs to be produced to show entitlement.

In the United States, the standard retirement age is currently 66 (gradually increasing to 67). The AARP allows couples in which one spouse has reached the age of 50 to join, regardless of the age of the other spouse.

In Canada, the Old Age Security (OAS) pension is available at 65 (the Conservative government of Stephen Harper had planned to gradually increase the age of eligibility to 67, starting in the years 2023–2029, although the Liberal government of Justin Trudeau is considering leaving it at 65), and the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) as early as age 60.

==Signs==
The distinguishing characteristics of old age are both physical and mental. The marks of old age are so unlike the marks of middle age that legal scholar Richard Posner suggests that, as an individual transitions into old age, that person can be thought of as different people &quot;time-sharing&quot; the same identity.

These marks do not occur at the same chronological age for everyone. Also, they occur at different rates and order for different people. Marks of old age can easily vary between people of the same chronological age.

A basic mark of old age that affects both body and mind is &quot;slowness of behavior&quot;. The term describes a correlation between advancing age and slowness of reaction and physical and mental task performance. However, studies from Buffalo University and Northwestern University have shown that the elderly are a happier age group than their younger counterparts.

===Physical===
Physical marks of old age include the following:

*Bone and joint problems: Old bones are marked by &quot;thinning and shrinkage&quot;. This might result in a loss of height (about two inches (5 cm) by age 80), a stooping posture in many people, and a greater susceptibility to bone and joint diseases such as osteoarthritis and osteoporosis.
*Chronic diseases: Some older people have at least one chronic condition and many have multiple conditions. In 2007–2009, the most frequently occurring conditions among older people in the United States were uncontrolled hypertension (34%), arthritis (50%), and heart disease (32%).
*Chronic mucus hypersecretion (CMH), defined as &quot;coughing and bringing up sputum&quot;, is a common respiratory symptom in elderly people.
*Dental problems: Older people may have less saliva and reduced ability to maintain oral hygiene, consequently increasing the chance of tooth decay and infection.
*Digestive system issues: About 40% of the time, old age is marked by digestive disorders such as difficulty in swallowing, inability to eat enough and to absorb nutrition, constipation and bleeding.
*Essential tremor (ET): An uncontrollable shaking in a part of the upper body. It is more common in the elderly and symptoms worsen with age.
*Eyesight deterioration: Presbyopia can occur by age 50 and it hinders reading, especially of small print in low lighting. The speed with which an individual reads and the ability to locate objects may also be impaired. By age 80, more than half of all Americans either have a cataract or have had cataract surgery.
*Falls: Old age increases the risk of injury from falls. Every year, about a third of those 65 years old and more than half of those 80 years old fall. Falls are the leading cause of injury and death for old people.
*Gait change: Some aspects of gait normally change with old age. Speed slows after age 70. Time with both feet on the ground (&quot;double stance&quot;) increases. Old people sometimes move as if they were walking carefully on ice.
*Hair usually turns gray and may become thinner. About age 50, about 50% of Europeans have 50% grey hair. Many men are affected by balding.
*Women enter menopause.
*Hearing loss: By age 75, 48% of men and 37% of women have lost at least some significant hearing. Of the 26.7 million people [where?] over age 50 with a hearing impairment, one seventh use hearing aids. In the 70–79 age range, partial hearing loss affecting communication rises to 65%, mostly in low-income men.
*Hearts can become less efficient in old age, lessening stamina. Atherosclerosis can constrict blood flow.
*Immune-function loss (immunosenescence).
*Lungs may expand less efficiently, providing less oxygen.
*Mobility impairment or loss: &quot;Impairment in mobility affects 14% of those between 65 and 74, [and] half of those over 85.&quot; Loss of mobility is common in old people and has serious &quot;social, psychological, and physical consequences&quot;.
*Pain: 25% of seniors have chronic pain, increasing with age, up to 80% of those in nursing homes. Most pains are rheumatological, musculoskeletal-related, or malignant.
*Decreases in sexual drive in both men and women. Increasing research on sexual behavior and desires in later life is challenging the &quot;asexual&quot; image of older adults. People aged 75–102 do experience sensuality and sexual pleasure. Sexual attitudes and identity are established in early adulthood and change little. Sexuality remains important throughout life, and the sexual expression of &quot;typical, healthy older persons is a relatively neglected topic of research&quot;. Other known sexual behaviors in older age groups include sexual thoughts, fantasies, and dreams; masturbation; oral sex; and vaginal and anal intercourse. 
*Skin loses elasticity and gets drier and more lined and wrinkled.
*Wounds take longer to heal and are likelier to leave permanent scars.
*Trouble sleeping and daytime sleepiness affect more than half of seniors. In a study of 9,000 people with a mean age of 74, only 12% reported no sleep complaints. By age 65, deep sleep drops to about 5% of sleep time.
*Taste buds diminish by up to half by the age of 80. Food becomes less appealing and nutrition can suffer.
*Over the age of 85, thirst perception decreases, so that 41% of the elderly do not drink enough.
*Urinary incontinence is often found in old age.
*Vocal cords weaken and vibrate more slowly. This results in a weakened, breathy voice, &quot;old person&#x27;s voice&quot;.

===Mental===
Mental marks of old age include the following:

*Agreeability: Despite the stressfulness of old age, the words &quot;agreeable&quot; and &quot;accepting&quot; are used commonly to describe people of old age. However, in some people, the dependence that comes with old age induces feelings of incompetence and worthlessness from having to rely on others for many different basic living functions.
*Caution follows closely with old age. This antipathy toward &quot;risk-taking&quot; often stems from the fact that old people have less to gain and more to lose than younger people.
*Depressed mood. According to Cox, Abramson, Devine, and Hollon (2012), old age is a risk factor for depression caused by prejudice. When younger people are prejudiced against the elderly and then become old themselves, their anti-elderly prejudice turns inward, causing depression. &quot;People with more negative age stereotypes will likely have higher rates of depression as they get older.&quot; Old age depression results in the 65+ population having the highest suicide rate.
*Fear of crime in old age, especially among the frail, sometimes weighs more heavily than concerns about finances or health and restricts what they do. The fear persists in spite of the fact that old people are victims of crime less often than younger people.
* Increasing fear of health problems.
*Mental disorders affect about 15% of people aged 60+ according to estimates by the World Health Organization. Another survey taken in 15 countries reported that mental disorders of adults interfered with their daily activities more than physical problems.
*Reduced mental and cognitive ability: Memory loss is common in old age due to the brain&#x27;s decreased ability to encode, store, and retrieve information. It takes more time to learn the same amount of new information. The prevalence of dementia increases in old age from about 10% at age 65 to about 50% over age 85. Alzheimer&#x27;s disease accounts for 50 to 80 percent of dementia cases. Demented behavior can include wandering, physical aggression, verbal outbursts, depression, and psychosis.
*Stubbornness: A study of over 400 seniors found a &quot;preference for the routine&quot;. Explanations include old age&#x27;s toll on &quot;fluid intelligence&quot; and the &quot;more deeply entrenched&quot; ways of the old.

==Perspectives==
===Middle age===
Many books written by authors in middle adulthood depict a few common perceptions on old age. One writer notices the change in his parents: They move slowly, they have less strength, they repeat stories, their minds wander, and they fret. Another writer sees her aged parents and is bewildered: They refuse to follow her advice, they are obsessed with the past, they avoid risk, and they live at a &quot;glacial pace&quot;.

In her &quot;The Denial of Aging&quot;, Dr. Muriel R. Gillick, a baby boomer, accuses her contemporaries of believing that by proper exercise and diet they can avoid the scourges of old age and proceed from middle age to death. Studies find that many people in the 65–84 range can postpone morbidity by practicing healthy lifestyles. However, at about age 85, most people experience similar morbidity. Even with healthy lifestyles, most 85+ people will undergo extended &quot;frailty and disability&quot;.

===Old age===
Early old age can be a pleasant time; children are grown, work is over, and there is time to pursue other interests. Many old people are also willing to get involved in community and activist organizations to promote their well-being. In contrast, perceptions of old age by writers 80+ years old tend to be negative.

 writes that the first man known to talk about his old age was an Egyptian scribe who lived 4,500 years ago. The scribe addressed God with a prayer of lament:
Minois comments that the scribe&#x27;s &quot;cry shows that nothing has changed in the drama of decrepitude between the age of the Pharaoh and the atomic age&quot; and &quot;expresses all the anguish of old people in the past and the present&quot;.

Lillian Rubin, active in her 80s as an author, sociologist, and psychotherapist, opens her book &quot;60 on Up: The Truth about Aging in America&quot; with &quot;getting old sucks. It always has, it always will.&quot; Dr. Rubin contrasts the &quot;real old age&quot; with the &quot;rosy pictures&quot; painted by middle-age writers.

Writing at the age of 87, Mary C. Morrison describes the &quot;heroism&quot; required by old age: to live through the disintegration of one&#x27;s own body or that of someone you love. Morrison concludes, &quot;old age is not for the fainthearted&quot;. In the book &quot;Life Beyond 85 Years&quot;, the 150 interviewees had to cope with physical and mental debilitation and with losses of loved ones. One interviewee described living in old age as &quot;pure hell&quot;.

Research has shown that in high-income countries, on average, one in four people over 60 and one in three over 75 feels lonely.

====Misconceptions====
Johnson and Barer did a pioneering study of &quot;Life Beyond 85 Years&quot; by interviews over a six-year period. In talking with 85-year-olds and older, they found some popular conceptions about old age to be erroneous. Such erroneous conceptions include (1) people in old age have at least one family member for support, (2) old age well-being requires social activity, and (3) &quot;successful adaptation&quot; to age-related changes demands a continuity of self-concept. In their interviews, Johnson and Barer found that 24% of the 85+ had no face-to-face family relationships; many have outlived their families. Second, that contrary to popular notions, the interviews revealed that the reduced activity and socializing of the over-85s does not harm their well-being; they &quot;welcome increased detachment&quot;. Third, rather than a continuity of self-concept, as the interviewees faced new situations they changed their &quot;cognitive and emotional processes&quot; and reconstituted their &quot;self–representation&quot;.

===Societal and historical===

Based on his survey of old age in history, concludes that &quot;it is clear that always and everywhere youth has been preferred to old age&quot;. In Western thought, &quot;old age is an evil, an infirmity and a dreary time of preparation for death&quot;. Furthermore, death is often preferred over &quot;decrepitude, because death means deliverance&quot;.

&quot;The problem of the ambiguity of old age has ... been with us since the stage of primitive society; it was both the source of wisdom and of infirmity, experience and decrepitude, of prestige and suffering.&quot;

In the Classical period of Greek and Roman cultures, old age was denigrated as a time of &quot;decline and decrepitude&quot;. &quot;Beauty and strength&quot; were esteemed and old age was viewed as defiling and ugly. Old age was reckoned as one of the unanswerable &quot;great mysteries&quot; along with evil, pain, and suffering. &quot;Decrepitude, which shrivels heroes, seemed worse than death.&quot;

Historical periods reveal a mixed picture of the &quot;position and status&quot; of old people, but there has never been a &quot;golden age of aging&quot;. Studies have challenged the popular belief that in the past old people were venerated by society and cared for by their families. Veneration for and antagonism toward the aged have coexisted in complex relationships throughout history. &quot;Old people were respected or despised, honoured or put to death according to circumstance.&quot;

In ancient times, those who were frail were seen as a burden and ignored or, in extreme cases, killed. People were defined as &quot;old&quot; because of their inability to perform useful tasks rather than their years.

Although he was skeptical of the gods, Aristotle concurred in the dislike of old people. In his &quot;Ethics&quot;, he wrote that &quot;old people are miserly; they do not acknowledge disinterested friendship; only seeking for what can satisfy their selfish needs&quot;.

The Medieval and Renaissance periods depicted old age as &quot;cruel or weak&quot;.

The 16th-century Utopians Thomas More and Antonio de Guevara allowed no decrepit old people in their fictional lands.

For Thomas More, on the island of Utopia, when people are so old as to have &quot;out-lived themselves&quot; and are terminally ill, in pain, and a burden to everyone, the priests exhort them about choosing to die. The priests assure them that &quot;they shall be happy after death&quot;. If they choose to die, they end their lives by starvation or by taking opium.

Antonio de Guevara&#x27;s utopian nation &quot;had a custom, not to live longer than sixty five years&quot;. At that age, they practiced self-immolation. Rather than condemn the practice, Bishop Guevara called it a &quot;golden world&quot; in which people &quot;have overcome the natural appetite to desire to live&quot;.

==== Contemporary perspectives ====
In the modern period, the cultural status of old people has declined in many cultures. Joan Erikson observed that &quot;aged individuals are often ostracized, neglected, and overlooked; elders are seen no longer as bearers of wisdom but as embodiments of shame&quot;.

Attitudes toward old age well-being vary somewhat between cultures. For example, in the United States, being healthy, physically, and socially active are signs of a good old age. On the other hand, Africans focus more on food and material security and a helpful family when describing old age well-being. Additionally, Koreans are more anxious about aging and more scared of old people than Americans are.

Research on age-related attitudes consistently finds that negative attitudes exceed positive attitudes toward old people because of their looks and behavior. In his study &quot;Aging and Old Age&quot;, Posner discovers &quot;resentment and disdain of older people&quot; in American society. Harvard University&#x27;s implicit-association test measures implicit &quot;attitudes and beliefs&quot; about &quot;Young vis a vis Old&quot;. &quot;Blind Spot: Hidden Biases of Good People&quot;, a book about the test, reports that 80% of Americans have an &quot;automatic preference for the young over old&quot; and that attitude is true worldwide. The young are &quot;consistent in their negative attitude&quot; toward the old. &quot;Ageism&quot; documents that Americans generally have &quot;little tolerance for older persons and very few reservations about harboring negative attitudes&quot; about them.

Despite its prevalence, ageism is seldom the subject of public discourse.

===Simulated===
Simone de Beauvoir wrote that &quot;there is one form of experience that belongs only to those that are old – that of old age itself&quot;. Nevertheless, simulations of old age attempt to help younger people gain some understanding.

Texas A&amp;M University offers a plan for an &quot;Aging Simulation&quot; workshop. The workshop is adapted from &quot;Sensitizing People to the Processes of Aging&quot;. Some of the simulations include:
:* Sight: Wearing swimmer&#x27;s goggles with black paper pasted to lens with only a small hole to simulate tunnel vision
:* Hearing: Use ear plugs to dull the sound of people talking
:* Touch: Trying to button a shirt or buckle a belt while wearing thick gloves
:* Dexterity: Unscrew a jar lid with tape around several fingers
:* Mobility and balance: Carry packages in one hand while using a walker

The Macklin Intergenerational Institute conducts Xtreme Aging workshops, as depicted in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. A condensed version was presented on NBC&#x27;s Today Show and is available online. One exercise was to lay out 3 sets of 5 slips of paper. On set #1, write your 5 most enjoyed activities; on set #2, write your 5 most valued possessions; on set #3, write your 5 most loved people. Then &quot;lose&quot; them one by one, trying to feel each loss, until you have lost them all, as happens in old age.

==Frailty==

Most people in the age range of 65–79 (the years of retirement and early old age) enjoy rich possibilities for a full life, but the condition of frailty, distinguished by &quot;bodily failure&quot; and greater dependence, becomes increasingly common from around age 80. In the United States, hospital discharge data from 2003 to 2011 shows that injury was the most common reason for hospitalization among patients aged 65+.

Gerontologists note the lack of research regarding and the difficulty in defining frailty. However, they add that physicians recognize frailty when they see it.

A group of geriatricians proposed a general definition of frailty as &quot;a physical state of increased vulnerability to stressors that results from decreased reserves and disregulation in multiple physiological systems&quot;.

Frailty is a common condition in later old age but different definitions of frailty produce diverse assessments of prevalence. One study placed the incidence of frailty for ages 65+ at 10.7%. Another study placed the incidence of frailty in age 65+ population at 22% for women and 15% for men. A Canadian study illustrated how frailty increases with age and calculated the prevalence for 65+ as 22.4% and for 85+ as 43.7%.

A worldwide study of &quot;patterns of frailty&quot; based on data from 20 nations found (a) a consistent correlation between frailty and age, (b) a higher frequency among women, and (c) more frailty in wealthier nations where greater support and medical care increases longevity.

In Norway, a 20-year longitudinal study of 400 people found that bodily failure and greater dependence became prevalent in the 80+ years. The study calls these years the &quot;fourth age&quot; or &quot;old age in the real meaning of the term&quot;. Similarly, the &quot;Berlin Aging Study&quot; rated overall functionality on four levels: good, medium, poor, and very poor. People in their 70s were mostly rated good. In the 80–90 year range, the four levels of functionality were divided equally. By the 90–100 year range, 60% would be considered frail because of very poor functionality and only 5% still possessed good functionality.

===Markers===
Three unique markers of frailty have been proposed: (a) loss of any notion of invincibility, (b) loss of ability to do things essential to one&#x27;s care, and (c) loss of possibility for a subsequent life stage.

Old age survivors on average deteriorate from agility in their early retirement years (65–79) to a period of frailty preceding death. This deterioration is gradual for some and precipitous for others. Frailty is marked by an array of chronic physical and mental problems which means that frailty is not treatable as a specific disease. These problems, coupled with increased dependency in the basic activities of daily living (ADLs) required for personal care, add emotional problems: depression and anxiety. In sum, frailty has been depicted as a group of &quot;complex issues&quot;, distinct but &quot;causally interconnected&quot;, that often include &quot;comorbid diseases&quot;, progressive weakness, stress, exhaustion, and depression.

Healthy humans after age 50, accumulate endogenous DNA single- and double-strand breaks in a linear fashion in cellular DNA. Other forms of DNA damage also increase with age. After age 50 a decline in DNA repair capability also occurs. These findings are in accord with the theory that DNA damage is a fundamental aspect of aging in older people.

===Care and costs===
Frail people require a high level of care. Medical advances have made it possible to extend life, or &quot;postpone death&quot;, at old age for years. This added time costs many frail people &quot;prolonged sickness, dependence, pain, and suffering&quot;.

According to a study by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the rate of emergency department visits was consistently highest among patients ages 85 years and older in 2006–2011 in the United States. Additionally, patients aged 65+ had the highest percentage of hospital stays for adults with multiple chronic conditions but the second highest percentage of hospital costs in 2003–2014.

These final years are also costly in economic terms. One out of every four Medicare dollars is spent on the frail in their last year of life ... in attempts to postpone death.

Medical treatments in the final days are not only economically costly, but they are often unnecessary or even harmful. Nortin Hadler, M.D. warns against the tendency to medicalize and overtreat the frail. In her &quot;Choosing Medical Care in Old Age&quot;, Michael R. Gillick M.D. argues that appropriate medical treatment for the frail is not the same as for the robust. The frail are vulnerable to &quot;being tipped over&quot; by any physical stress put on the system such as medical interventions.

In addition to everyday care, frail elderly people and others with disabilities are particularly vulnerable during natural disasters. They may be unable or unwilling to evacuate to avoid a hurricane or wildfire.

===Death===
Old age, death, and frailty are closely linked, with approximately half the deaths in old age preceded by months or years of frailty.

&quot;Older Adults&#x27; Views on Death&quot; is based on interviews with 109 people in the 70–90 age range, with a mean age of 80.7. Almost 20% of the people wanted to use whatever treatment that might postpone death. About the same number said that, given a terminal illness, they would choose assisted suicide. Roughly half chose doing nothing except live day by day until death comes naturally without medical or other intervention designed to prolong life. This choice was coupled with a desire to receive palliative care if needed.

About half of older adults have multimorbidity, that is, they have three or more chronic conditions. Medical advances have made it possible to &quot;postpone death&quot;, but in many cases this postponement adds &quot;prolonged sickness, dependence, pain, and suffering&quot;, a time that is costly in social, psychological, and economic terms.

The longitudinal interviews of 150 age 85+ people summarized in &quot;Life Beyond 85 Years&quot; found &quot;progressive terminal decline&quot; in the year prior to death: constant fatigue, much sleep, detachment from people, things, and activities, simplified lives. Most of the interviewees did not fear death; some would welcome it. One person said, &quot;Living this long is pure hell.&quot; However, nearly everyone feared a long process of dying. Some wanted to die in their sleep; others wanted to die &quot;on their feet&quot;.

The study of &quot;Older Adults&#x27; Views on Death&quot; found that the more frail people were, the more &quot;pain, suffering, and struggles&quot; they were enduring, the more likely they were to &quot;accept and welcome&quot; death as a release from their misery. Their fear about the process of dying was that it would prolong their distress. Besides being a release from misery, some saw death as a way to reunite with deceased loved ones. Others saw death as a way to free their caretakers from the burden of their care.

==Religiosity==
Generally speaking, old people have always been more religious than young people. At the same time, wide cultural variations exist.
In the United States, 90% of old age Hispanics view themselves as very, quite, or somewhat religious. The Pew Research Center&#x27;s study of black and white old people found that 62% of those in ages 65–74 and 70% in ages 75+ asserted that religion was &quot;very important&quot; to them. For all 65+ people, more women (76%) than men (53%) and more blacks (87%) than whites (63%) consider religion &quot;very important&quot; to them. This compares to 54% in the 30–49 age range.

In a British 20-year longitudinal study, less than half of the old people surveyed said that religion was &quot;very important&quot; to them, and a quarter said they had become less religious in old age. The late-life rise in religiosity is stronger in Japan than in the United States, but in the Netherlands it is minimal.

In the practice of religion, a study of 60+ people found that 25% read the Bible every day and over 40% watch religious television. Pew Research found that in the age 65+ range, 75% of whites and 87% of blacks pray daily. When comparing religiosity, the individual practice may be a more accurate measure than participation in organized religion. With organized religion, participation may often be hindered due to transportation or health problems.

==Demographic changes==
In the industrialized countries, life expectancy and, thus, the old age population have increased consistently over the last decades. In the United States the proportion of people aged 65 or older increased from 4% in 1900 to about 12% in 2000. In 1900, only about of the nation&#x27;s citizens were 65 or older (out of 76 million total American citizens). By 2000, the number of senior citizens had increased to about 35 million (of 280 million US citizens). Population experts estimate that more than Americans—about 17 percent of the population—will be 65 or older in 2020. By 2050, it is projected that at least 400,000 Americans will be 100 or older.

The number of old people is growing around the world chiefly because of the post–World War II baby boom and increases in the provision and standards of health care. By 2050, 33% of the developed world&#x27;s population and almost 20% of the less developed world&#x27;s population will be over 60 years old.

The growing number of people living to their 80s and 90s in the developed world has strained public welfare systems and has also resulted in increased incidence of diseases like cancer and dementia that were rarely seen in premodern times. When the United States Social Security program was created, people older than 65 numbered only around 5% of the population and the average life expectancy of a 65-year-old in 1936 was approximately 5 years, while in 2011 it could often range from 10 to 20 years. Other issues that can arise from an increasing population are growing demands for health care and an increase in demand for different types of services.

Of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds—100,000 per day—die of age-related causes.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In industrialized nations, the proportion is much higher, reaching 90%.

==Psychosocial aspects==

According to Erik Erikson&#x27;s &quot;Stages of Psychosocial Development&quot;, the human personality is developed in a series of eight stages that take place from the time of birth and continue on throughout an individual&#x27;s complete life. He characterises old age as a period of &quot;Integrity vs. Despair&quot;, during which people focus on reflecting back on their lives. Those who are unsuccessful during this phase will feel that their life has been wasted and will experience many regrets. The individual will be left with feelings of bitterness and despair. Those who feel proud of their accomplishments will feel a sense of integrity. Successfully completing this phase means looking back with few regrets and a general feeling of satisfaction. These individuals will attain wisdom, even when confronting death. Coping is a very important skill needed in the aging process to move forward with life and not be &#x27;stuck&#x27; in the past. The way people adapt and cope, reflects their aging process on a psycho-social level.

For people in their 80s and 90s, Joan Erikson added a ninth stage in &quot;The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version&quot;. As she wrote, she added the ninth stage because the Integrity of the eighth stage imposes &quot;a serious demand on the senses of elders&quot; and the Wisdom of the eighth stage requires capacities that ninth stage elders &quot;do not usually have&quot;.

Newman &amp; Newman also proposed a ninth stage of life, Elderhood. Elderhood refers to those individuals who live past the life expectancy of their birth cohorts. They described two different types of people in this stage of life. The &quot;young old&quot; are the healthy individuals who can function on their own without assistance and can complete their daily tasks independently, while the &quot;old old&quot; are those who depend on specific services due to declining health or diseases.

===Theories===
Social theories, or concepts, propose explanations for the distinctive relationships between old people and their societies.

One theory, proposed in 1961, is the disengagement theory, which proposes that, in old age, a mutual disengagement between people and their society occurs in anticipation of death. By becoming disengaged from work and family responsibilities, according to this concept, people are enabled to enjoy their old age without stress. This theory has been subjected to the criticism that old age disengagement is neither natural, inevitable, nor beneficial. Furthermore, disengaging from social ties in old age is not across the board: unsatisfactory ties are dropped and satisfying ones kept.

In opposition to the disengagement theory, the activity theory of old age argues that disengagement in old age occurs not by desire, but by the barriers to social engagement imposed by society. This theory has been faulted for not factoring in psychological changes that occur in old age as shown by reduced activity, even when available. It has also been found that happiness in old age is not proportional to activity.

According to the continuity theory, in spite of the inevitable differences imposed by their old age, most people try to maintain continuity in personhood, activities, and relationships with their younger days.

Socioemotional selectivity theory also depicts how people maintain continuity in old age. The focus of this theory is continuity sustained by social networks, albeit networks narrowed by choice and by circumstances. The choice is for more harmonious relationships. The circumstances are loss of relationships by death and distance.

==Life expectancy==
Life expectancy by nation at birth in the year 2011 ranged from 48 years to 82 years. Low values were caused by high death rates for infants and children.

In almost all countries, women, on average, live longer than men. The disparities vary between 12 years in Russia to no difference or higher life expectancy for men in countries such as Zimbabwe and Uganda.

The number of elderly people worldwide began to surge in the second half of the 20th century. In developed countries before then, five or less percent of the population was over 65. Few lived longer than their 70s and people who attained advanced age (i.e. their 80s) were rare enough to be a novelty and were revered as wise sages. The worldwide over-65 population in 1960 was one-third of the under-5 population. By 2013, the over-65 population had grown to equal the under-5 population and is projected to double the under-5 population by 2050.

Before the surge in the over-65 population, accidents and disease claimed many people before they could attain old age, and health problems in those over 65 meant a quick death in most cases. If a person lived to an advanced age, it was generally due to genetic factors and/or a relatively easy lifestyle, since diseases of old age could not be treated before the 20th century.

In October 2016, a group of scientists identified the maximum human lifespan at an average age of 115, with an absolute upper limit of 125 years. However, the concept of a maximum lifespan of humans is still widely debated among the scientific community.

==Benefits==
German chancellor Otto von Bismarck created the world&#x27;s first comprehensive government social safety net in the 1880s, providing for old age pensions. It was a political solution by conservatives to weaken the socialist movement.

In the United States of America, and the United Kingdom, 65 (UK 60 for women) was traditionally the age of retirement with full old age benefits.

In 2003, the age at which a United States citizen became eligible for full Social Security benefits began to increase gradually, and will continue to do so until it reaches 67 in 2027. Full retirement age for Social Security benefits for people retiring in 2012 is age 66. In the United Kingdom, the state pension age for men and women will rise to 66 in 2020 with further increases scheduled after that.

Originally, the purpose of old age pensions was to open up jobs for younger unemployed people, and also prevent elderly people from being reduced to beggary, which is still common in some underdeveloped countries, but growing life expectancies and older populations have brought into question the model under which pension systems were designed. Some complained that &quot;powerful&quot; and &quot;greedy&quot;, old people were getting more than their share of the nation&#x27;s resources. In 2011, using a Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM), the old age American poverty rate was measured as 15.9%.

==Assistance==
In the United States in 2008, 11 million people aged 65+ lived alone: 5 million or 22% of ages 65–74, 4 million or 34% of ages 75–84, and 2 million or 41% of ages 85+. The 2007 gender breakdown for all people 65+ was men 19% and women 39%.

Many new assistive devices made especially for the home have enabled more old people to care for their own activities of daily living (ADL). Some examples of devices are a medical alert and safety system, shower seat (making it so the person does not get tired in the shower and fall), a bed cane (offering support to those with unsteadiness getting in and out of bed) and an ADL cuff (used with eating utensils for people with paralysis or hand weakness).

A Swedish study found that at age 76, 46% of the subjects used assistive devices. When they reached age 86, 69% used them. The subjects were ambivalent regarding the use of the assistive devices: as &quot;enablers&quot; or as &quot;disablers&quot;. People who view assistive devices as enabling greater independence accept and use them, whereas those who see them as symbols of disability reject them. However, organizations like Love for the Elderly aim to combat such age-related prejudice by educating the public about the importance of appreciating growing older, while also providing services of kindness to elders in senior homes.

Even with assistive devices as of 2006, 8.5 million Americans needed personal assistance because of impaired basic activities of daily living required for personal care or impaired instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) required for independent living. Projections place this number at 21 million by 2030 when 40% of Americans over 70 will need assistance. There are many options for such long-term care to those who require it. There is home care in which a family member, volunteer, or trained professional will aid the person in need and help with daily activities. Another option is community services which can provide the person with transportation, meal plans, or activities in senior centers. A third option is assisted living where 24-hour round-the-clock supervision is given with aid in eating, bathing, dressing, etc. A final option is a nursing home which provides professional nursing care.

== Culture ==

In 2014, a documentary film called &quot;The Age of Love&quot; used humor and the poignant adventures of 30 seniors who attend a speed dating event for 70 to 90-year-olds and discover how the search for romance changes—or does not change—from childhood to old age.

===Artistic depiction===
Scholarly literature has emerged, especially in Britain, showing historical trends in the visual depiction of old age.

<doc id="229063" wikidata="Q498237" url="?curid=229063" title="Schizoid personality disorder">
<text>Schizoid personality disorder (, often abbreviated as SzPD or ScPD) is a personality disorder characterized by a lack of interest in social relationships, a tendency toward a solitary or sheltered lifestyle, secretiveness, emotional coldness, detachment, and apathy. Affected individuals may be unable to form intimate attachments to others and simultaneously possess a rich and elaborate but exclusively internal fantasy world. Other associated features include stilted speech, a lack of deriving enjoyment from most activities, feeling as though one is an &quot;observer&quot; rather than a participant in life, an inability to tolerate emotional expectations of others, apparent indifference when praised or criticized, being on the asexual spectrum, and idiosyncratic moral or political beliefs.

Symptoms typically start in late childhood or adolescence. The cause of SzPD is uncertain, but there is some evidence of links and shared genetic risk between SzPD, other cluster A personality disorders, and schizophrenia. Thus, SzPD is considered to be a &quot;schizophrenia-like personality disorder&quot;. It is diagnosed by clinical observation, and it can be very difficult to distinguish SzPD from other mental disorders or conditions (such as autism spectrum disorder, with which it may sometimes overlap).

The effectiveness of psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatments for the disorder has yet to be empirically and systematically investigated. This is largely because people with SzPD rarely seek treatment for their condition. Originally, low doses of atypical antipsychotics were used to treat some symptoms of SzPD, but their use is no longer recommended. The substituted amphetamine bupropion may be used to treat associated anhedonia. However, it is not general practice to treat SzPD with medications, other than for the short-term treatment of acute co-occurring disorders (e.g. depression). Talk therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may not be effective, because people with SzPD may have a hard time forming a good working relationship with a therapist.

SzPD is a poorly studied disorder, and there is little clinical data on SzPD because it is rarely encountered in clinical settings. Studies have generally reported a prevalence of less than 1%. It is more commonly diagnosed in males than in females. SzPD is linked to negative outcomes, including a significantly compromised quality of life, reduced overall functioning even after 15 years, and one of the lowest levels of &quot;life success&quot; of all personality disorders (measured as &quot;status, wealth and successful relationships&quot;). Bullying is particularly common towards schizoid individuals. Suicide may be a running mental theme for schizoid individuals, though they are not likely to attempt it. Some symptoms of SzPD (e.g. solitary lifestyle, emotional detachment, loneliness, and impaired communication), however, have been stated as general risk factors for serious suicidal behavior.

== History ==
The term &quot;schizoid&quot; was coined in 1908 by Eugen Bleuler to describe a human tendency to direct attention toward one&#x27;s inner life and away from the external world. Bleuler describes these personalities as &quot;comfortably dull and at the same time sensitive, people who in a narrow manner pursue vague purposes&quot;. This description echoes Bleuler&#x27;s 1911 description of a personality pathology functionally related to schizophrenia, as described in his seminal work, &quot;Dementia Praecox or the Group of Schizophrenias.&quot; 

August Hoch in 1910 introduced a very similar concept called the &quot;shut-in&quot; personality. Characteristics of it were reticence, reclusiveness, shyness and a preference for living in fantasy worlds, among others. In 1925, Russian psychiatrist Grunya Sukhareva described a &quot;schizoid psychopathy&quot; in a group of children, resembling today&#x27;s SzPD and ASD. About a decade later Pyotr Gannushkin also included &quot;Schizoids&quot; and &quot;Dreamers&quot; in his detailed typology of personality types.

It has been argued that descriptive tradition began in 1925 with the description of observable schizoid behaviors by Kretschmer. However, various theorist prior to Kretschmer described observable behaviours characteristic of schizoid personality as conceptualized by the early descriptive tradition, including Karl Kahlbaum in 1890, Emil Kraepelin in 1902 and 1919, Bleuler in 1911 and 1920, and Adolf Meyer in 1906, 1908, and 1912. Nevertheless, Kretschmer&#x27;s seminal work involving schizoid personality, &quot;Physique and Character&quot;, was highly influential and constituted the most robust description of observable schizoid behaviours, and was notably descriptive for setting forth classifications based on these observable behaviours. However, it would be in error to claim that Kretschmer was operating solely from the descriptive tradition.

In &quot;Physique and Character&quot;, and under a specific influence of the Bleuler school, which Kretschmer failed to properly credit, the schizoid is organized into three characteristic groups:

# Unsociability, quietness, reservedness, seriousness and eccentricity.
# Timidity, shyness with feelings, sensitivity, nervousness, excitability, fondness of nature and books.
# Pliability, kindliness, honesty, indifference, silence and cold emotional attitudes.

These characteristics are thought to be precursors of the DSM-III subcategorization of the schizoid character into three distinct personality disorders: schizotypal, avoidant and schizoid. However, Kretschmer&#x27;s divisions were dimensional, and Kretschmer himself did not conceive of separating these behaviors to the point of radical isolation but considered them to be simultaneously present as varying potentials in schizoid individuals. For Kretschmer, the majority of schizoid people are not &quot;either&quot; oversensitive &quot;or&quot; cold, but they are oversensitive and cold &quot;at the same time&quot; in quite different relative proportions, with a tendency to move along these dimensions from one behavior to the other. Though Krestchmer notes that as a schizoid individual ages, she tends to become more anaclitic. Moreover, as per Bleuler&#x27;s various works on the fundamental features of schizophrenia, this &quot;split&quot; in temperamental characteristics was thought by Kretschmer to be a fundamental, defining feature of schizoid personality. 

The second path to schizoid personality, that of dynamic psychiatry, began in 1924 with the influence of observations by descriptive psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler, who observed that the schizoid person and schizoid pathology were not things to be set apart, though Bleuler argued for this earlier, on schizophrenic diseases more generally, in &quot;Dementia Praecox or the Group of Schizophrenias&quot;. In addition, Bleuler himself was strongly influenced by earlier dynamic theorists, such as Sigmund Freud on the &quot;day-dreamer&quot; in 1908 and on secondary narcissism in 1914, and Carl Jung on introversion in 1917. Later, under the influence of Bleuler and others, Ronald Fairbairn&#x27;s seminal work on the schizoid condition, which was divided into schizophrenia proper; the schizoid personality type, the schizoid character; and transient schizoid episodes, and from which most of what is known today about psychodynamic schizoid phenomena is derived, was presented in 1940. Here, Fairbairn delineated four central schizoid themes:

# The need to regulate interpersonal distance as a central focus of concern.
# The ability to mobilize self-preservative defenses and self-reliance.
# A pervasive tension between the anxiety-laden need for attachment and the defensive need for distance that manifests in observable behavior as &quot;indifference&quot;.
# An overvaluation of the inner world at the expense of the outer world.

Following Fairbairn&#x27;s derivation of SzPD from a combination of derealization, depersonalization, splitting, the oral stage of making all subjects into partial objects, and intellectualization; the dynamic psychiatry tradition has continued to produce rich explorations on the schizoid character, most notably from writers Nannarello (1953), Laing (1965), Winnicott (1965), Guntrip (1969), Khan (1974), Akhtar (1987), Seinfeld (1991), Manfield (1992) and Klein (1995).

The DSM-I had the diagnosis of &quot;schizoid personality&quot;, which was defined by avoidance of close relationships, inability to express aggressive feelings, and autistic thinking (thinking which is preoccupied with one&#x27;s inner experience). The DSM-II later updated the definition to include daydreaming, detachment from reality, and sensitivity. It was incorporated into the DSM-III as &quot;schizoid personality disorder&quot; to describe difficulties forming meaningful social relationships and a persistent pattern of disconnection and apathy. The diagnosis of SzPD made it to the DSM-IV and DSM-V.

== Epidemiology ==
It remains unclear how prevalent the disorder is. It may be present in anywhere from 0.5% to 7% of the population and possibly 14% of the homeless population. Gender differences in this disorder are also unclear. Some research has suggested that this disorder may occur more frequently in men than women. SzPD is uncommon in clinical settings (about 2.2%) and occurs more commonly in males. It is rare compared with other personality disorders. Philip Manfield suggests that the &quot;schizoid condition&quot;, which roughly includes the DSM schizoid, avoidant and schizotypal personality disorders, is represented by &quot;as many as forty percent of all personality disorders.&quot; Manfield adds: &quot;This huge discrepancy [from the ten percent reported by therapists for the condition] is probably largely because someone with a schizoid disorder is less likely to seek treatment than someone with other axis-II disorders.&quot; A 2008 study assessing personality and mood disorder prevalence among homeless people at New York City drop-in centers reported an SzPD rate of 65% among this sample. The study did not assess homeless people who did not show up at drop-in centers, and the rates of most other personality and mood disorders within the drop-in centers were lower than that of SzPD. The authors noted the limitations of the study, including the higher male-to-female ratio in the sample and the absence of subjects outside the support system or receiving other support (e.g., shelters) as well as the absence of subjects in geographical settings outside New York City, a large city often considered a magnet for disenfranchised people. A University of Colorado Colorado Springs study comparing personality disorders and Myers–Briggs Type Indicator types found that the disorder had a significant correlation with the Introverted (I) and Thinking (T) preferences.

== Etiology ==

=== Environmental ===
Perfectionist and hypercritical parenting or cold, neglectful, and distant parenting contribute to the onset of SzPD. For a person with SzPD, their parents likely were intolerant of their emotional experiences. They may have been forced to repress and compartmentalize their emotions, possibly resulting in the onset of difficulties expressing and processing emotional experiences. These difficulties lead to the child feeling rejected and developing the belief that the only safe environment is one where they are alone and inexpressive. People with SzPD may also have internalized the belief that their emotions are dangerous to themselves and others due to the negative responses received from others. In their status of isolation and emotional bluntness they can be self-sufficient and safe. Childhood trauma can also contribute to feelings of emptiness in adulthood. Alcoholism in parents is associated with a heightened risk of developing SzPD.

=== Genetic ===
Sula Wolff, who did extensive research and clinical work with children and teenagers with schizoid symptoms, stated that &quot;schizoid personality has a constitutional, probably genetic, basis.&quot; Research on heritability and this disorder is lacking. Twin studies with SzPD traits (e.g., low sociability and low warmth) suggest that these traits are inherited. Besides this indirect evidence, the direct heritability estimates of SzPD range from 50% to 59%. Earlier, less methodologically rigorous research had found the heritability rate to be 29%.

The pathophysiology of SzPD remains unclear. Genetic relationships with people who have schizophrenia spectrum disorders increase the risk of developing schizoid personality disorder. People with SzPD can have a history of schizotypy before developing the disorder. SzPD symptoms can be premorbid to schizophrenia.

=== Neurological ===
Prenatal malnutrition, premature birth, and low birth weight are all thought to play a role in the development of SzPD. SzPD is associated with reduced serotonergic and dopaminergic pathways in areas such as the frontal lobe, amygdala, and striatum. Traumatic brain injuries to the frontal lobe may also contribute to the onset of SzPD as that area of the brain controls areas such as emotion and socialization. Deficits in the right hemisphere of the brain may also be associated with SzPD. Lower levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol may be correlated with the presence of schizoid traits in women. Excess indices in the left hemisphere may also be related to SzPD.

== Prognosis ==
Traits of schizoid personality disorder appear in childhood and adolescence. Children with this disorder usually have poor relationships with others, social anxiety, internal fantasies, strange behavior, and hyperactivity. These behaviors can result in teasing and bullying at the hands of others. It is common for people with SzPD to have had major depressive disorder in childhood. SzPD is associated with lower levels of achievement, a compromised quality of life, and a worse outcome of treatment. Treatment for this disorder is under-studied and poorly understood. There is no widely accepted and approved psychotherapy or medication for this disorder. It is one of the most poorly researched psychiatric disorders. Professionals may misunderstand the disorder and the client, potentially reinforcing a feeling of failure and negatively impacting their willingness to continue to commit to treatment. Clinicians tend to worry that they are incapable of properly treating the patient. It is rare for someone with this disorder to voluntarily seek treatment without a comorbid disorder or pressure from family or friends. In treatment, people with SzPD are usually disinterested and often minimize symptoms. Patients with SzPD may fear losing their independence through therapy. Many schizoid individuals will avoid making the efforts required to establish a proper relationship with the therapist. It can be difficult for them to open up or discuss their emotions in therapy. Although people with this disorder can still improve, it is unlikely they will ever experience significant joy through social interaction.

== Signs and symptoms ==

=== Social isolation ===

SzPD is associated with a dismissive-avoidant attachment style. People with this disorder will rarely maintain close relationships and often exclusively choose to participate in solitary activities. People with schizoid personality disorder typically have no close friends or confidants, except for a close relative on occasions.

They usually prefer hobbies and activities that do not require interaction with others. People with SzPD may be averse to social situations due to difficulties deriving pleasure from physical or emotional sensations, rather than social anhedonia.

One potential motivation for avoiding social situations is that they feel that it intrudes on their freedom. Relationships can feel suffocating for people with SzPD, and they may think of them as opportunities for entrapment.

Patients with this disorder are often independent and turn to themselves as sources of validation. They tend to be the happiest when in relationships in which their partner places few emotional or intimate demands on them and does not expect phatic or social niceties. It is not necessarily people they want to avoid, but negative &quot;or&quot; positive emotional expectations, emotional intimacy, and self-disclosure.

Patients with SzPD can feel as if close emotional bonds are dangerous to themselves and others. They may have feelings of inadequacy or shame. Some people with SzPD may experience a deep desire to connect with others, yet will be terrified by the dangers inherent in doing so. Avoidance of social situations may be a method of avoiding being hurt or rejected.

Individuals with SzPD can form relationships with others based on intellectual, physical, familial, occupational, or recreational activities, as long as there is no need for emotional intimacy. Donald Winnicott explains this is because schizoid individuals &quot;prefer to make relationships on their own terms and not in terms of the impulses of other people.&quot; Failing to attain that, they prefer isolation.

In general, friendship for schizoid individuals is usually limited to one other person, who is often also schizoid, forming what has been called a union of two eccentrics; &quot;within it – the ecstatic cult of personality, outside it – everything is sharply rejected and despised&quot;. Their unique lifestyle can lead to social rejection and people with SzPD are at a higher risk of facing bullying or homelessness. This social rejection can reinforce their asocial behavior.

=== Sexuality ===
People with this disorder usually have little to no interest in sexual or romantic relationships; it is rare for people with SzPD to date or marry. Sex often causes individuals with SzPD to feel that their personal space is being violated, and they commonly feel that masturbation or sexual abstinence is preferable to the emotional closeness they must tolerate when having sex. Significantly broadening this picture are notable exceptions of SzPD individuals who engage in occasional or even frequent sexual activities with others. Individuals with SzPD have long been noted to have an increased rate of unconventional sexual tendencies, though if present, these are rarely acted upon. Schizoid people are often labeled asexual or present with &quot;a lack of sexual identity&quot;. Kernberg states that this apparent lack of sexuality does not represent a lack of sexual definition but rather a combination of several strong fixations to cope with the same conflicts. People with SzPD are often able to pursue any fantasies with content on the internet while remaining completely unengaged with the outside world.

=== Emotions ===
Sensory or emotional experiences typically provide little enjoyment for people with SzPD. They rarely display strong emotions or react to anything. People with SzPD can have difficulty expressing themselves and seem to be directionless or passive. Individuals with SzPD can also experience anhedonia. They can also have difficulty understanding others&#x27; emotions and social cues. It can be hard for people with SzPD to assess the impact of their actions in social situations. People with this condition are often indifferent towards criticism or praise and can appear distant, aloof, or uncaring to others. They may avoid others and expressing themselves as a method of keeping others distant and preventing themselves from being hurt. Remaining alone and expressionless can feel safe and comfortable for people with SzPD. Expressing themselves can make them feel shame or discomfort. People with SzPD may feel inadequate and can be sensitive, although they have difficulty expressing it. Alexithymia, or difficulties understanding one&#x27;s own emotions, is common amongst people with SzPD. This leads to them isolating themselves to avoid the discomfort and stimulation that emotional experiences offer. According to Guntrip, Klein, and others, people with SzPD may possess a hidden sense of superiority and lack dependence on other people&#x27;s opinions. This is very different from the grandiosity seen in narcissistic personality disorder, which is described as &quot;burdened with envy&quot; and with a desire to destroy or put down others. Additionally, schizoid individuals do not go out of their way to achieve social validation. Unlike narcissists, schizoid people will often keep their creations private to avoid unwelcome attention or the feeling that their ideas and thoughts are being appropriated by the public. When forced to rely on others, a person with SzPD may feel panic or terror.

=== Feelings of unreality ===
Patients with SzPD often feel unreal, empty, and separate from their own emotions. They tend to perceive themselves as fundamentally different from others and can believe that they are fundamentally unlikeable. Other people often seem strange and incomprehensible to a person with SzPD. Reality can feel unenjoyable and uninteresting to people with SzPD. They have difficulty finding motivation and lack ambition. Patients with SzPD often feel as if they are &quot;going through the motions&quot; or that &quot;life passes them by.&quot; Many describe feeling as if they are observing life from a distance. Aaron Beck and his colleagues report that people with SzPD seem comfortable with their aloof lifestyle and consider themselves observers, rather than participants in the world around them. But they also mention that many of their schizoid patients recognize themselves as socially deviant (or even defective) when confronted with the different lives of ordinary people – especially when they read books or see movies focusing on relationships. Even when schizoid individuals may not long for closeness, they can become weary of being &quot;on the outside, looking in&quot;. These feelings may lead to depression, depersonalization, or derealization. If they do, schizoid people often experience feeling &quot;like a robot&quot; or &quot;going through life in a dream&quot;. People with SzPD may try to avoid all physical activity in order to become nobody and disconnect from reality. This can lead to the patient spending a large quantity of time sleeping and ignoring bodily functions such as hygiene.

=== Internal fantasy ===
Although this disorder does not affect the patient&#x27;s capacity to understand reality, they may engage in excessive daydreaming and introspection. Their daydreams can grow to consume most of their lives. Real life can become secondary to their fantasy, and they can have complex lives and relationships which exist entirely inside of their internal fantasy. These daydreams may constitute a defense mechanism to protect the patient from the outside world and its difficulties. Common themes in their internal fantasies are omnipotence and grandiosity. The related schizotypal personality disorder and schizophrenia are reported to have ties to creative thinking, and it is speculated that the internal fantasy aspect of SzPD may also be reflective of this thinking. Alternatively, there has been an especially large contribution of people with schizoid symptoms to science and theoretical areas of knowledge, including mathematics, physics, economics, etc. At the same time, people with SzPD are helpless at many practical activities because of their symptoms.

=== Suicide and self-harm ===
Symptoms of SzPD such as isolation and the blunted affect put people with schizoid personality disorder at a higher risk of suicide and non-suicidal self-harm. This may be because their reduced capacities for emotion prevent them from properly dealing with strife. Their solitary nature may contribute by preventing them from finding relief in relationships. Demonstrative suicides or suicide blackmail, as seen in cluster B personality disorders such as borderline, histrionic, or antisocial, are extremely rare among schizoid individuals. As in other clinical mental health settings, among suicidal inpatients, individuals with SzPD are not as well represented as some other groups. A 2011 study on suicidal inpatients at a Moscow hospital found that schizoid individuals were the least common patients, while those with cluster B personality disorders were the most common.

=== Low weight ===
A study that looked at the body mass index (BMI) of a sample of both male adolescents diagnosed with SzPD and those diagnosed with Asperger syndrome found that the BMI of all patients was significantly below normal. Clinical records indicated abnormal eating behavior by some patients. Some patients would only eat when alone and refused to eat out. Restrictive diets and fears of disease were also found. It was suggested that the anhedonia of SzPD may also affect eating, leading schizoid individuals to not enjoy it. Alternatively, it was suggested that schizoid individuals may not feel hunger as strongly as others or not respond to it, a certain withdrawal &quot;from themselves&quot;.

=== Substance abuse ===
Very little data exists for rates of substance use disorder among people with SzPD, but existing studies suggest they are less likely to have substance abuse problems than the general population. One study found that significantly fewer boys with SzPD had alcohol problems than a control group of non-schizoid people. Another study evaluating personality disorder profiles in substance abusers found that substance abusers who showed schizoid symptoms were more likely to abuse one substance rather than many, in contrast to other personality disorders such as borderline, antisocial, or histrionic, which were more likely to abuse many. American psychotherapist Sharon Ekleberry states that the impoverished social connections experienced by people with SzPD limit their exposure to the drug culture and that they have limited inclination to learn how to do illegal drugs. Describing them as &quot;highly resistant to influence&quot;, she additionally states that even if they could access illegal drugs, they would be disinclined to use them in public or social settings, and because they would be more likely to use alcohol or cannabis alone than for social disinhibition, they would not be particularly vulnerable to negative consequences in early use. People with SzPD are at a lower risk of substance abuse issues than people with other personality disorders. They may form relationships with their substances as a substitute for human contact or to cope with emotional issues. People with SzPD may desire psychedelic drugs more than other kinds.

=== Secret schizoids ===
Many schizoid individuals display an engaging, interactive personality, contradicting the observable characteristic emphasized by the DSM-5 and ICD-10 definitions of the schizoid personality. Guntrip (using ideas of Klein, Fairbairn, and Winnicott) classifies these individuals as &quot;secret schizoids&quot;, who behave with socially available, interested, engaged, and involved interaction yet remain emotionally withdrawn and sequestered within the safety of the internal world. Klein distinguishes between a &quot;classic&quot; SzPD and a &quot;secret&quot; SzPD, which occur &quot;just as often&quot; as each other. Klein cautions one should not misidentify the schizoid person as a result of the patient&#x27;s defensive, compensatory interaction with the external world. He suggests one ask the person what their subjective experience is, to detect the presence of the schizoid refusal of emotional intimacy and preference for objective fact. A 2013 study looking at personality disorders and Internet use found that being online more hours per day predicted signs of SzPD. Additionally, SzPD correlated with lower phone call use and fewer Facebook friends.

Descriptions of the schizoid personality as &quot;hidden&quot; behind an outward appearance of emotional engagement have been recognized since 1940, with Fairbairn&#x27;s description of &quot;schizoid exhibitionism&quot;, in which the schizoid individual can express a great deal of feeling and make what appear to be impressive social contacts yet, in reality, gives nothing and loses nothing. Because they are &quot;playing a part&quot;, their personality is not involved. According to Fairbairn, &quot;the person&quot; disowns the part they are playing, and the schizoid individual seeks to preserve their personality intact and immune from compromise. The schizoid person&#x27;s false persona is based on what those around them define as normal or good behavior, as a form of compliance. Further references to the secret schizoid come from Masud Khan, Jeffrey Seinfeld, and Philip Manfield. These scholars described secret schizoids as people who enjoy public speaking engagements but experience great difficulty during the breaks when audience members would attempt to engage them emotionally. These references expose the problems in relying on outer observable behavior for assessing the presence of personality disorders in certain individuals.

==== Autism spectrum disorder ====
Several studies have reported an overlap or comorbidity with autism spectrum disorder and Asperger syndrome. Asperger syndrome had traditionally been called &quot;schizoid disorder of childhood&quot;, and Eugen Bleuler coined both the terms &quot;autism&quot; and &quot;schizoid&quot; to describe withdrawal to an internal fantasy, against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance. In a 2012 study of a sample of 54 young adults with Asperger syndrome, it was found that 26% of them also met the criteria for SzPD, the highest comorbidity out of any personality disorder in the sample (the other comorbidities were 19% for obsessive–compulsive personality disorder, 13% for avoidant personality disorder and one female with schizotypal personality disorder). Additionally, twice as many men with Asperger syndrome met the criteria for SzPD than women. While 41% of the whole sample were unemployed with no occupation, this rose to 62% for the Asperger&#x27;s and SzPD comorbid group. Tantam suggested that Asperger syndrome may confer an increased risk of developing SzPD. A 2019 study found that 54% of a group of males aged 11 to 25 with Asperger syndrome showed significant SzPD traits, with 6% meeting full diagnostic criteria for SzPD, compared to 0% of a control group.

In the 2012 study, it was noted that the DSM may complicate diagnosis by requiring the exclusion of a pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) before establishing a diagnosis of SzPD. The study found that social interaction impairments, stereotyped behaviors, and specific interests were more severe in the individuals with Asperger syndrome also fulfilling SzPD criteria, against the notion that social interaction skills are unimpaired in SzPD. The authors believe that a substantial subgroup of people with autism spectrum disorder or PDD have clear &quot;schizoid traits&quot; and correspond largely to the &quot;loners&quot; in Lorna Wing&#x27;s classification &quot;The autism spectrum&quot; (Lancet 1997), described by Sula Wolff. The authors of the 2019 study hypothesized that it is extremely likely that historic cohorts of adults diagnosed with SzPD either also had childhood-onset autistic syndromes or were misdiagnosed. They stressed that further research to clarify overlap and distinctions between these two syndromes was strongly warranted, especially given that high-functioning autism spectrum disorders are now recognized in around 1% of the population.

== Treatment ==

=== Medication ===
There are no effective medications for schizoid personality disorder. However, certain medications may reduce the symptoms of SzPD and treat co-occurring mental disorders. Since the symptoms of SzPD mirror the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, antipsychotics have been suggested as a potentially effective medication for SzPD. Originally, low doses of atypical antipsychotics like risperidone or olanzapine were used to alleviate social deficits and blunted affect. However, a 2012 review concluded that atypical antipsychotics were ineffective for treating personality disorders. Antidepressants, SSRIs, anxiolytics, bupropion, modafinil, benzodiazepines, and biofeedback may also be effective treatments.
=== Psychotherapy ===
Treatment for this disorder uses a combination of cognitive-behavioral therapy and psychodynamic psychotherapy. These techniques can be used to help patients identify their defense mechanisms and change them. Therapists attempt to establish healthy relationships with their clients, helping to combat their internalized belief that relationships are harmful and unhelpful. Relationships with a therapist can seem terrifying and intrusive to a person with SzPD. They may feel as if they need to alter or hide their feelings to meet the therapist&#x27;s demands or expectations. To combat this, therapists try to gradually increase their patient&#x27;s emotional expression. Expressing too much too early can lead to their ending therapy. Treatment must be person centered, with clients feeling understood and well regarded. This can allow them to connect with and understand their emotions. When people with SzPD do not have their feelings validated, this will confirm their belief that expressing themselves is dangerous. Therapists attempt to avoid intruding on their patients&#x27; lives or restricting their freedoms, so as to prevent them from feeling as if therapy is intolerable. Because of this, therapy is usually less structured than treatment programs for other disorders. Patients may benefit from long-term treatment lasting several years. Inpatient care may be effective for treating SzPD and other Cluster A disorders.

== Controversy ==
The original concept of the schizoid character developed by Ernst Kretschmer in the 1920s comprised a mix of avoidant, schizotypal, and schizoid traits. It was not until 1980 and the work of Theodore Millon that led to splitting this concept into three personality disorders (now schizoid, schizotypal, and avoidant). This caused debate about whether this was accurate or if these traits were different expressions of a single personality disorder. It has also been argued due to the poor consistency and efficiency of diagnosis due to overlapping traits that SzPD should be removed altogether from the DSM. A 2012 article suggested that two different disorders may better represent SzPD: one affect-constricted disorder (belonging to schizotypal PD) and a seclusive disorder (belonging to avoidant PD). They called for the replacement of the SzPD category from future editions of the DSM with a dimensional model which would allow for the description of schizoid traits on an individual basis.

Some critics such as Nancy McWilliams of Rutgers University and Panagiotis Parpottas of European University Cyprus argue that the definition of SzPD is flawed due to cultural bias and that it does not constitute a mental disorder but simply an avoidant attachment style requiring a more distant emotional proximity. If that is true, then many of the more problematic reactions these individuals show in social situations may be partly accounted for by the judgments commonly imposed on people with this style.

Similarly, John Oldham, using a dimensional approach, thinks that most people with schizoid character features do not have a full-blown personality disorder. Impairment is mandatory for any behavior to be diagnosed as a personality disorder.

== Diagnosis ==

=== Guntrip criteria ===
Ralph Klein, Clinical Director of the Masterson Institute, delineates the following nine characteristics of the schizoid personality as described by Harry Guntrip:

* Introversion
* Withdrawnness
* Narcissism
* Self-sufficiency
* A sense of superiority
* Loss of affect
* Loneliness
* Depersonalization
* Regression

The description of Guntrip&#x27;s nine characteristics should clarify some differences between the traditional DSM portrait of SzPD and the traditional informed object relations view. All nine characteristics are consistent. Most, if not all, must be present to diagnose a schizoid disorder.

=== Millon&#x27;s subtypes ===
Theodore Millon restricted the term &quot;schizoid&quot; to those personalities who lack the capacity to form social relationships. He characterizes their way of thinking as being vague and void of thoughts and as sometimes having a &quot;defective perceptual scanning&quot;. Because they often do not perceive cues that trigger affective responses, they experience fewer emotional reactions.

For Millon, SzPD is distinguished from other personality disorders in that it is &quot;the personality disorder that lacks a personality.&quot; He criticizes that this may be due to the current diagnostic criteria: They describe SzPD only by an absence of certain traits, which results in a &quot;deficit syndrome&quot; or &quot;vacuum&quot;. Instead of delineating the presence of something, they mention solely what is lacking. Therefore, it is hard to describe and research such a concept.

He identified four subtypes of SzPD. Any schizoid individual may exhibit none or one of the following:
=== Akhtar&#x27;s profile ===
American psychoanalyst Salman Akhtar provided a comprehensive phenomenological profile of SzPD in which classic and contemporary descriptive views are synthesized with psychoanalytic observations. This profile is summarized in the table reproduced below that lists clinical features that involve six areas of psychosocial functioning and are organized by &quot;overt&quot; and &quot;covert&quot; manifestations.

&quot;Overt&quot; and &quot;covert&quot; are intended to denote seemingly contradictory aspects that may both simultaneously be present in an individual. These designations do not necessarily imply their conscious or unconscious existence. The covert characteristics are by definition difficult to discern and not immediately apparent. Additionally, the lack of data on the frequency of many of the features makes their relative diagnostic weight difficult to distinguish at this time. However, Akhtar states that his profile has several advantages over the DSM in terms of maintaining historical continuity of the use of the word &quot;schizoid&quot;, valuing depth and complexity over descriptive oversimplification and helping provide a more meaningful differential diagnosis of SzPD from other personality disorders.

<text>Brooks&#x27;s law is an observation about software project management that &quot;Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.&quot; It was coined by Fred Brooks in his 1975 book &quot;The Mythical Man-Month&quot;. According to Brooks, under certain conditions, an incremental person when added to a project makes it take more, not less time.

== Explanations ==
According to Brooks himself, the law is an &quot;outrageous oversimplification&quot;, but it captures the general rule. Brooks points to the main factors that explain why it works this way:
# It takes some time for the people added to a project to become productive. Brooks calls this the &quot;ramp up&quot; time. Software projects are complex engineering endeavors, and new workers on the project must first become educated about the work that has preceded them; this education requires diverting resources already working on the project, temporarily diminishing their productivity while the new workers are not yet contributing meaningfully. Each new worker also needs to integrate with a team composed of several engineers who must educate the new worker in their area of expertise in the code base, day by day. In addition to reducing the contribution of experienced workers (because of the need to train), new workers may even make negative contributions, for example, if they introduce bugs that move the project further from completion.
# Communication overhead increases as the number of people increases. Due to combinatorial explosion, the number of different communication channels increases rapidly with the number of people. Everyone working on the same task needs to keep in sync, so as more people are added they spend more time trying to find out what everyone else is doing.
# Adding more people to a highly divisible task, such as cleaning rooms in a hotel, decreases the overall task duration (up to the point where additional workers get in each other&#x27;s way). However, other tasks including many specialties in software projects are less divisible; Brooks points out this limited divisibility with another example: while it takes one woman nine months to make one baby, &quot;nine women can&#x27;t make a baby in one month&quot;.

== Exceptions and possible solutions ==
There are some key points in Brooks&#x27;s law that allow exceptions and open the door for possible solutions.

The first point is to note that Brooks&#x27;s law only applies to projects that are already late. Projects can be brought back into (or kept in) control if people are added earlier in the process. It is also important to determine if the project is really late, or if the schedule was originally overly optimistic. Scheduling mistakes account for a large number of late projects. Correcting the schedule is the best way to have a meaningful and reliable time frame for the project&#x27;s completion.

The quantity, quality and role of the people added to the project also must be taken into consideration. One simple way to circumvent the law on an overrun project is to add more people than needed, in such a way that the extra capacity compensates the training and communication overhead. Good programmers or specialists can be added with less overhead for training. People can be added to do other tasks related with the project, for example, quality assurance or documentation; given that the task is clear, ramp up time is minimized.

Good helps by minimizing the communication overhead between team members. Smaller sub-problems are solved by a smaller team, and a top-level team is responsible for systems integration. For this method to work, the segmentation of the problem must be done correctly in the first place; if done incorrectly, this can make the problem worse, not better, by impeding communication between programmers working on parts of the problem which are actually closely coupled, even when the project plan has decreed that they are not.

An example of segmentation are design patterns that simplify the distribution of work, because the entire team can do its part within the framework provided by that pattern. The design pattern defines the rules that the programmers follow, simplifies communication through the use of a standard language, and provides consistency and scalability.

The &quot;Bermuda plan&quot;, where most developers on a project are removed (&quot;sent to Bermuda&quot;) and the remaining are left to complete the software, has been suggested as a way of circumventing Brooks&#x27;s law.

<text>A look-alike, or double, is a person who bears a strong physical resemblance to another person, excluding cases like twins and other instances of family resemblance.

Some look-alikes have been notable individuals in their own right. Other notable look-alikes have been notable solely for resembling well-known individuals, such as Clifton James, who acted as a double for British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery during World War II.
Some look-alikes who have resembled celebrities have worked as entertainers, impersonating them on stage or screen, or at venues like parties and corporate functions. Professional look-alikes have often been represented by talent agencies specializing in celebrity impersonators.
Close physical resemblance between individuals is also a common plot point in works of fiction.

==Research==
According to a paper published in 2022 in the journal &quot;Cell Reports&quot;, look-alikes share many common genetic variations and are more likely than non-look-alikes to have characteristics in common.

With the advent of social media, there have been several reported cases of people finding their &quot;twin stranger&quot; online. There are several websites where users can upload a photo of themselves and facial recognition software attempts to match them with another user of like appearance. Some of these sites report that they have found numerous living doppelgängers.

== Notable look-alikes ==
*A popular story about King Umberto I of Italy tells of the king eating in a restaurant and discovering the owner was his dead-ringer double. The story goes that upon talking to the man, Umberto learned of a string of coincidences between their lives, such as: the two men had been born in the same town on the same day, and had both married a woman with the same name, and the restaurant had opened on the day of Umberto&#x27;s coronation. Umberto&#x27;s assassination in 1900 is said to have happened the same day that he heard the news that the restaurateur had died in a shooting. This story is cited often in popular culture (&quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot;, &quot;The Big Book of the Unexplained&quot;) and may have been embellished somewhat.

* The United Kingdom&#x27;s King George V (1865–1936) and Russia&#x27;s Tsar Nicholas II (1868–1918), who were first cousins (their mothers were sisters), bore an uncanny resemblance. Their facial features were distinguishable only up close, particularly their eyes. At George&#x27;s wedding in 1893, according to &quot;The Times&quot; of London, the crowd may have mistaken Nicholas for George due to their similar beards and attire.
* An urban legend claims that Charlie Chaplin entered one of the many Chaplin look-alike contests and lost. It is retold in the musical &quot;Chaplin&quot;.
* Mikheil Gelovani, a Georgian actor and Joseph Stalin look-alike, played the Soviet leader in propaganda films of the 1930s and 1940s.

* In 1944, shortly before D-Day, M. E. Clifton James, who bore a close resemblance to Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, was sent to Gibraltar and North Africa, in order to deceive the Germans about the location of the upcoming invasion. This story was the subject of a book and film, &quot;I Was Monty&#x27;s Double&quot;.
* A notable conspiracy theory holds that Paul McCartney died in 1966 and was replaced by a Canadian policeman named William Shears Campbell (&quot;Billy Shears&quot;).
* In the 1970s, actor-comedian Richard M. Dixon (born James LaRoe), look-alike to then-President Richard Nixon, gained some celebrity, portraying the president in the films, &quot;Richard&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Faking of the President&quot; (1976). He also appeared in director Woody Allen&#x27;s initially unreleased short film &quot;Men of Crisis: The Harvey Wallinger Story&quot; (1971).
* Jeannette Charles (1927-2024) often worked in film as a look-alike to Britain&#x27;s Queen Elizabeth II (1926-2022).
* British stuntman Vic Armstrong acted as Harrison Ford&#x27;s body double in all the films of the original &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; trilogy. Reportedly, Armstrong looked so much like Harrison Ford that the crew members on set were constantly mistaking him for Ford.
* When Uffe Ellemann-Jensen was Denmark&#x27;s foreign minister, he was often compared to Danish pop singer Johnny Reimar.
* Saddam Hussein allegedly employed several look-alikes for political purposes during his Iraq reign. According to a CBS &quot;60 Minutes&quot; segment in late January 2008, Saddam Hussein denied to an American interrogator that he had employed doubles.
* The BBC comedy programme &quot;Doubletake&quot; made extensive use of look-alikes playing their doubles in apparently embarrassing situations, seen through CCTV cameras and amateur video, using distance shots and shaky camera-work to disguise the true identity of those being filmed. Due to the nature of this programme and conditions of filming, many of the world&#x27;s most authentic lookalikes boycotted the project leaving the producer to rely on the careful use of soft focus, lighting and carefully positioned camera angles to make the mainly amateur lookalikes resemble the characters they portrayed.
* Armando Iannucci&#x27;s &quot;Friday Night Armistice&quot; (1996–98) featured &quot;the bus of Dianas&quot;, a bus full of Princess Diana (1961-1997) look-alikes which was dispatched to &quot;care&quot; at the sites of various minor tragedies.
* Steve Sires, a look-alike of Microsoft&#x27;s Bill Gates, came to attention when he attempted to trademark &quot;Microsortof&quot;, and subsequently acted in Microsoft commercials. He appeared as Gates in the films &quot;Nothing So Strange&quot; (2002) and &quot;The Social Network&quot; (2010).
* UK &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; contestant Chantelle Houghton worked briefly and unsuccessfully for a look-alike agency as a Paris Hilton look-alike, earning the nickname &quot;Paris Travelodge&quot;. By the time Chantelle Houghton won series 4 of &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;, the same agency had already signed up a professional model who made a more convincing Paris Hilton look-alike and who was briefly also offered as a fake &quot;Chantelle&quot;.
* UK &quot;Richard and Judy&quot; ran a competition for Little Britain Lookalikes in 2005. After the live final broadcast on Friday, 28 January 2005, on Channel Four, two winning contestants, Gavin Pomfret and Stuart Morrison, formed a Little Britain tribute act called &quot;Littler Britain.&quot;
* Dolly Parton has stated that she lost a &#x27;Dolly Parton Look-Alike Contest&#x27;.
* In 2008 a friend pointed out to Bronx native Louis Ortiz his striking resemblance to then-presidential-candidate Barack Obama. Ortiz, initially as a money-making venture, sought gigs as an Obama impersonator. Ryan Murdock produced a documentary film about Ortiz&#x27;s experiences, &quot;Bronx Obama&quot;.
* Two of the Parti Québécois&#x27;s candidates: Bertrand St-Arnaud and Bernard Drainville
* Larissa Tudor looked strikingly similar to former Grand Duchess Tatiana of Russia. Larissa&#x27;s background was sketchy and included a lot of irregularities. After her death in 1926 it was rumored that she was the former grand duchess. When author Occleshaw wrote a book about Larissa 60 years after her death, those who had known her identified a picture of the former Grand Duchess Tatiana as being Larissa.
* Howard X is a professional impersonator who looks like the North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un.
* Former basketball player Andrew Bynum has famously been compared to actor Tracy Morgan
* Suzie Kennedy is a British impersonator who looks like the actress Marilyn Monroe, and in 2020 impersonated her on &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;.
* Two baseball players, both called Brady Feigl, share an uncanny resemblance to each other. Additionally, both are pitchers for their respective baseball teams, they are the same height, and they both suffered an elbow injury that was treated by the same doctor.
* Hannah Taylor Gordon is a British actress who portrayed the famous Jewish diarist Anne Frank in the movie &quot;Anne Frank: The Whole Story&quot; and was even lauded as looking like the diarist despite being 5&#x27;9.

Fortunately, he has an exact double: a patent-medicine salesman and vaudeville hoofer who is a charismatic campaigner but has no actual political qualifications. The film cynically suggests that most American voters would prefer the latter to the former. Both roles are played by legendary song-and-dance man George M. Cohan.
* The 1940 comedy film &quot;The Great Dictator&quot; was Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s first talkie and his most commercially successful film.
