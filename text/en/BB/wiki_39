<text>Peter of Blois (; French: &quot;Pierre de Blois&quot;; ) was a French cleric, theologian, poet and diplomat. He is particularly noted for his corpus of Latin letters.

==Early life and education==
Peter of Blois was born about 1130. Earlier opinion tended to place the date later in the 1130s, but an earlier date is now considered more likely. His family were minor nobility of Breton origin.

After an early visit to Paris, Peter received his literary education at the school attached to Tours Cathedral in the early 1140s probably accompanied and mentored by an older namesake and relative, Pierre de Blois. He studied under Bernard Silvestris, who, he later recalled, urged him to “take up in truth not fables, but history” and made him memorise the letters of Hildebert, a former Archbishop of Tours. It has been thought Peter also studied under the English philosopher and theologian John of Salisbury, but this is now generally discounted.

Peter then studied Roman law at the University of Bologna, a centre for legal studies. Here he was tutored by Baldwin of Forde, a future Archbishop of Canterbury, and both studied under Umberto Crivelli, the future Pope Urban III. Peter was much more strongly attracted to the rhetorical and literary aspects of the subject than to jurisprudence: as he wrote later, “sporting with its glorious verbal trappings and charming, fanciful oratorical urbanity, attracted me powerfully and intoxicated my mind.”

Around 1155 Peter went to study theology in Paris, remaining there for about 11 years. Few details of his studies are extant. It appears that he supported himself during his advanced studies by taking students of his own, including two sons of Josceline de Bohon, a long-serving Bishop of Salisbury.

It was probably during his student years that he composed a number of Latin sequences after the manner of the Goliards, some of which were preserved in the &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; collection. He also wrote &quot;Vacillantis trutine libramine&quot;.

==The Sicilian adventure==
In 1166 the regent of Sicily, Margaret of Navarre, a relative of the Counts of Perche, wrote to her relatives in France, particularly Rotrou, the Archbishop of Rouen, to ask for help during the minority of her son, William II. Peter of Blois and his brother Guillaume arrived in Sicily in September of that year, as part of a French party of 37 that included Stephen du Perche and Walter of the Mill. Peter became tutor to the young king, guardian of the royal seal and a key adviser to Queen Margaret, while Guillaume was appointed abbot of a monastery near Maletto. However, the French clique around the regency proved unpopular with the Sicilian nobility. A revolt against French domination forced Stephen to resign the chancellorship and the Archbishopric of Palermo in 1169. Peter left the island to seek opportunities elsewhere, sailing initially to Genoa and then travelling back to France.

There his connection with Archbishop Rotrou proved useful, drawing him into a letter-writing campaign focussed on Henry II of England&#x27;s conflict with Thomas Becket. This brought him back into contact with Reginald Fitz Jocelin, his former pupil from his days in Paris, who was now Henry&#x27;s chief agent in the dispute. When Reginald was made Bishop of Bath in 1173, his role in the Becket affair made papal approval problematic and Peter&#x27;s letters on his behalf proved helpful in rallying support.

==Angevin service==

===Diplomat and apologist===
Around 1173, Peter went to England to take up a post as chief letter-writer for Richard of Dover, Becket&#x27;s successor as Archbishop. He also entered the service of Henry II, acting as a diplomat in his negotiations with Louis VII of France and the Papacy. His arrival in England approximately coincided with the rupture of the ruling family and the eruption of civil strife all over the Angevin Empire, carefully fomented by the French monarchy. Peter wrote an open letter to the queen, Eleanor of Aquitaine, to &quot;deplore publicly and regretfully that, while you are a most prudent woman, you have left your husband.&quot; However, when in 1183 Henry the Young King died during the revolt against his father, Peter wrote to Eleanor a letter of reasoned consolation.

Peter was a well-connected controversialist and propagandist for Henry II. He wrote in praise of him to continental contacts, like Walter Ophamil, now Archbishop of Palermo, defending him against the charge that he had deliberately instigated the murder of Thomas Becket. In introducing the subject of Becket&#x27;s death, Peter mentioned in passing his own clerical order: &quot;in verbo Domini et in ordine diaconi vobis dico&quot; – “in the Word of God and the order of deacon I speak to you.” At some stage in his education, he had been ordained a deacon and he seems to have avoided ordination to the priesthood.

In 1176 Peter was appointed Chancellor of the Archdiocese of Canterbury, the chief record keeper and Latin secretary, serving Richard of Dover. Probably in the same year, he was appointed Archdeacon of Bath, a position he held until his death. It was probably in Henry&#x27;s reign that he was appointed Dean of the College of Wolverhampton, which he found corrupt.

Peter was in Rome in 1179 and there displayed the improvidence which was to become an important feature of his later life. His failure to repay a debt caused Pope Alexander III to write to the Archbishop on behalf of the creditor. This was a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; sufficient for inclusion in a compendium of canon law issued in 1234 by Pope Gregory IX. Richard of Dover died in 1184 and, after some delay, the king succeeded in getting Baldwin of Forde, Peter&#x27;s friend and tutor from his Bologna days, installed as Archbishop of Canterbury. He confirmed Peter in his position as letter writer but also made him his chief legal adviser.

===The Canterbury Cathedral chapter controversy===
Baldwin soon created a legal storm that was to engulf Peter, threatening his career. He was determined to reform the diocese thoroughly, making it function more efficiently as a base for his position as one of the chief magnates of the realm. He saw the chapter of Canterbury Cathedral as a major obstacle. Like most cathedral establishments, it had consisted of secular clergy until the Norman Conquest, after which it was reconstituted as a community of Benedictine monks, known variously as the Priory of the Holy Trinity or Christchurch. The mutual antagonism was sharpened by the rivalry between their respective monastic orders, as Baldwin was a Cistercian. He began by recovering diocesan property which his predecessor had alienated to the priory in order to support the pilgrim traffic, centred on the shrine of Thomas Becket, as well as confiscating the &quot;xenia&quot;, or Easter offerings – a process which was authorised by Pope Lucius III. However, the monks of the chapter were soon complaining to his successor, Urban III, that his reforms were going too far and succeeded in getting the Pope to order restoration of some of the confiscated churches. Urban initially welcomed some aspects of Baldwin&#x27;s overarching plan to move the chapter to Hackington, north of Canterbury, and to build a second base for the diocese at Lambeth, directly facing the centres of secular power in London and Westminster. However, the plan unfolded to include the replacement of the monastic chapter with a new episcopal staff, consisting of colleges of secular clergy at Hackington and Lambeth.

Seeing their influence and wealth slipping from their grasp, the Canterbury monks appealed to both the king and to Rome. Baldwin suspended the prior in December 1186 and the monks immediately began a letter-writing campaign to mobilise bishops, archbishops, even Philip II of France, in their cause. Peter of Blois was despatched to the papal court at Verona to counter the chapter&#x27;s arguments, which were presented by a skilled Roman lawyer called Pillius. As Urban was his old law teacher, he could be expected to have at least insight, and probably influence. However, his enjoyment of Roman law had always been aesthetic rather than technical.

On 1 March 1187, before Peter&#x27;s arrival, the Pope ordered Baldwin to lift the suspension of Prior Honorius, who had already reached Verona. Peter arrived at Verona a few days later to find the Pope had adjourned the case until 10 April, giving Peter no chance to plead formally while a further series of decrees was issued in the monks&#x27; favour. However, Peter was no more successful in open court, suffering a continuing series of defeats. On 9 May the Pope ordered Archbishop Baldwin to cease building his new church at Hackington, abolished the fraternity he had established to staff and support it, and expressed surprise that he had so far resisted restoration of the situation to that prevailing before the appeal. Peter remained at Verona, arguing the case, until October, and then followed the papal court to Ferrara. Provocative behaviour back home did not help Peter. Baldwin continued to build his church in defiance of the Pope but with the king&#x27;s support, although he did move the site some distance to the west, hurriedly putting up a wooden chapel in St Dunstan&#x27;s parish. In August he seized the chapter&#x27;s manors, suspending and even excommunicating its members as he saw fit.

On 3 October, having reached Ferrara, the Pope raised the stakes by ordering Baldwin actually to demolish his new headquarters, to desecrate the site and to suspend its clergy, to restore all members of the existing chapter to office and to refrain from further actions against them while the case continued. He was given 30 days to comply. R. W. Southern alleges that Peter made a last, personal appeal to his old teacher while riding from Verona to Ferrara, and that the Pope was so incensed by the attempt to circumvent legal procedure that he died the following day of a heart attack. Kingsford&#x27;s account is much less dramatic, without the foreshortened time scheme. The Pope&#x27;s letter from Ferrara seems to have preceded his death by some weeks: he died on 19 October and was buried on the 20th, while Pope Gregory VIII was elected on 21 October, as Honorius reported to his monks. Peter&#x27;s own later account of Urban&#x27;s death has him taken ill while changing horses, shortly after Peter had approached him, but also mentions he contracted dysentery on the journey from Verona – an entirely plausible cause of death. The new pope moved the court to Pisa on its way towards Rome. He seems to have been less sympathetic to the Cathedral chapter but made no further decisions before he died at Pisa in December and was succeeded by Pope Clement III.

The delays could only postpone Peter&#x27;s inevitable defeat. Baldwin used the breathing space to renew his campaign of suspension and excommunication against his opponents, while Honorius, like Peter, remained at the papal court, as he had been ordered to return there by the chapter. However, on 26 January 1188, Clement made a final decision on the matter, which he communicated in a letter to Baldwin. He rebuked the archbishop for his lack of moderation, which tended to undermine the dignity of his office, and for his disobedience, before repeating all of Urban&#x27;s demands: the new collegiate church was forbidden and the previous situation was to be restored. Baldwin continued his vindictive campaign against the monks, who were imprisoned in their own priory at the cathedral until August 1189, a month after the death of Henry II, when Richard I imposed a resolution.

However, Peter&#x27;s legal advocacy had suffered a comprehensive defeat, with serious consequences for his reputation. He returned to England. In his later accounts of the issue, he ignored the political and economic issues, portraying it entirely as a failed attempt to remedy the moral abuses of the Canterbury Cathedral chapter.

==Later years==
===On crusade===

After Henry&#x27;s death in 1189, Peter seems to have dropped out of favour – perhaps not surprisingly, in view of his outspoken support for the old king. He devoted his energy to propaganda in favour of a new expedition, the Third Crusade, to rescue the Kingdom of Jerusalem after the Battle of Hattin, and to writing a biography of the crusader Raynald of Châtillon.

True to his beliefs, he and Archbishop Baldwin set out for the Holy Land late in 1189, accompanying King Richard as far as Sicily. They pressed on to join the crusaders at Tyre, where Baldwin died on 20 November 1190. Peter found his way back to Sicily. He then probably accompanied Eleanor of Aquitaine on the return journey through Italy and France, finally arriving in England in autumn 1191.

===Continuing influence and financial difficulties===
Peter seems to have repaired relations with Eleanor of Aquitaine. Both Bréhier and Kingsford describe Peter as her secretary during the early 1190s. However, Southern merely mentions the three letters he wrote in her name to the Pope protesting against Richard I&#x27;s detention by Leopold V, Duke of Austria. Southern categorically denies that he was an employee of Eleanor.

When Hubert Walter emerged as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1193, Peter was no longer retained in any formal capacity by the archdiocese, although he was still consulted. He tried to repair relations with the cathedral chapter, claiming Henry II had compelled him to act as he did and that he had been cruelly deceived – a claim that probably met with incredulity. He also continued to exercise considerable influence over other leading churchmen.

Matters eased slightly after Richard&#x27;s death and both his influence and material fortunes seem to have revived in the early years of John&#x27;s reign. He was appointed Archdeacon of London by 1202. However, despite still holding a number of potentially lucrative posts, he seems always to have been in financial difficulties. He protested in a letter to Innocent III some time around 1200 that his income from his archdiaconate barely met his basic expenses.

===The Wolverhampton college affair===
Although he had probably been dean of Wolverhampton for some time, very likely since the reign of Henry II, the oldest extant evidence of his interest in the collegiate church dates from about 1190. He wrote to William Longchamp, the Chancellor of England and Bishop of Ely to denounce the “tyranny of the Viscount of Stafford” – presumably the Sheriff of Staffordshire – who was, he complained, trampling on the church&#x27;s ancient privileges and oppressing the townspeople. This is fairly reliably datable, as Longchamp&#x27;s ascendancy was short-lived, and he was forced to flee the country in 1191. Moreover the sheriff at the time was Hugh Nonant, who was actually the Bishop of Coventry, ally of the regent John and a sworn enemy of Longchamp.

It is probable that decreased political involvement gave Peter more opportunity to take an interest in the affairs of the town and the collegiate church. Moreover, he was taking increasing interest in the spiritual life, particularly of the Cistercians and Carthusians. Peter resolved to deal with what he saw as the venality and nepotism of the canons at Wolverhampton. One of the canons who particularly offended him was Robert of Shrewsbury, who became Bishop of Bangor in 1197, apparently without election, and certainly without resigning his prebend at Wolverhampton. Peter wrote directly to Robert, denouncing his behaviour in strong terms and commending the virtue of apostolic poverty – ironically, in view of his own notorious pluralism.

Peter resigned as dean around 1202, and explained the situation in a letter to Innocent III. He claimed that the church was subject only to the archbishop and the king, under the Pope: later deans were to seek freedom from the archbishop too, with some success. He claimed that the indiscipline of the canons was such that it brought forth hissing and derision from the entire population. The solution he proposed was to replace the institution with a Cistercian abbey. Peter had already put forward the plan to Hubert Walter and won his and John&#x27;s support for it. Walter dissolved the college and, with Papal approval, John handed over the deanery and prebends to him in January 1203, in preparation for the new venture. A year later, the king granted a charter of liberties for the abbey and endowed it with properties, including the manors of Wolverhampton and Tettenhall. Cistercian monks had already begun to move into the site, although John had appointed one Nicholas as dean on Peter&#x27;s resignation. However, with the death of Hubert Walter in 1205, the entire project lapsed and John appointed as dean Henry, son of Geoffrey Fitz Peter, 1st Earl of Essex.

==Writings==
Peter is incorrectly associated with Pseudo-Ingulf&#x27;s &quot;Croyland Chronicle&quot;. However, many of his letters and poems are extant. According to Southern, Peter&#x27;s letters were widely read until the seventeenth century, &quot;for pleasure and instruction by cultivated readers&quot;. They conveyed &quot;moral, legal and theological instruction, and ... satire on men and institutions&quot;. He was the author of a number of controversial works of varying lengths.

At some time in the 1190s, for example, he wrote &quot;Against the Perfidy of the Jews&quot; (), which Peter commended in a preface to a Bishop of Worcester, probably John of Coutances. A strongly anti-Jewish work, it is largely a marshalling of arguments, ostensibly from Scripture, in favour of the Doctrine of the Trinity and other specifically Christian teachings, intended as a handbook of argumentation. However, he held out no hope of conversion: &quot;Their hour is not yet come, but He has blinded them till the time when the heathen are converted.&quot; Commenting on the Passion of Christ, he denounced the Jews as &quot;persisting in their malice&quot;.

&quot;Against the Perfidy of the Jews&quot; influenced official texts. Its &quot;clamour … is adopted in Papal Bulls, in sermons, monastic chronicles and many other texts …A common vocabulary of speaking about the Jew is developed … just as the period creates a long-lasting stereotype of the Jew&quot;.

==Family==
Peter&#x27;s brother was William of Blois, another poet, who is sometimes confused with William de Blois, the Bishop of Lincoln. A sister, Christiana of Blois, was a nun, whom Peter encouraged in her vocation.

<text>Walter of Châtillon (Latinized as Gualterus de Castellione) was a 12th-century French writer and theologian who wrote in the Latin language. He studied under Stephen of Beauvais and at the University of Paris. It was probably during his student years that he wrote a number of Latin poems in the Goliardic manner that found their way into the &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; collection. During his lifetime, however, he was more esteemed for a long Latin epic on the life of Alexander the Great, the &quot;Alexandreis, sive Gesta Alexandri Magni&quot;, a hexameter epic, full of anachronisms; he depicts the Crucifixion of Jesus as having already taken place during the days of Alexander the Great. The &quot;Alexandreis&quot; was popular and influential in Walter&#x27;s own times. Matthew of Vendôme and Alan of Lille borrowed from it and Henry of Settimello imitated it, but it is now seldom read. One line, referring to Virgil&#x27;s Aeneid, is sometimes quoted:

Many poems in his style, or borrowing his themes, have been attributed to Walter on insufficient evidence. For example, he was not the author of the satirical &quot;Apocalypse of Golias&quot; once attributed to him. In addition to his poems, Walter wrote a dialogue refuting Jewish thought and biblical interpretation and a treatise on the Trinity, and he was possibly the author of &quot;Moralium dogma philosophorum&quot;. He died of bubonic plague early in the 13th century.

David Townsend summarizes one commentary on Walter&#x27;s life as follows:

<doc id="231857" wikidata="Q1490170" url="?curid=231857" title="Slowcore">
<text>Slowcore, also known as sadcore, is a subgenre of indie rock characterised by its subdued tempos, minimalist instrumentation, and sombre vocal performances. Slowcore&#x27;s influences are diverse, involving varying other genres, including folk rock, alternative rock, and dream pop. As a result of these contrasting stylistic directions, there is no definitive characterisation of the genre.

The history of slowcore began in the late-1980s, with several bands forming in reaction to the abrasive sounds of grunge. Slow rock music, with a pensive style inspired by genres such as singer-songwriter and folk, laid the groundwork for the genre in the early years and until the mid-1990s, when Low played a pivotal role in establishing slowcore as one of the era&#x27;s microgenres; however, despite their retrospective acclamation as slowcore pioneers, Low was not the first band to produce slowcore. Codeine, Red House Painters, and Bedhead all released influential albums earlier that decade, while American Music Clubwidely considered to be the genre&#x27;s first actformed in 1982. Regardless, the mellow and restrained sound of Low&#x27;s debut album, &quot;I Could Live in Hope&quot; (1994), and their albums that followed over the next several years, came to define slowcore. Spain, Duster, and Ida, among others, all followed Low and furthered the reach of the genre, and by the 2000s, slowcore had a defined sound, even if it continued to lack obvious categorisation. Artists like Carissa&#x27;s Wierd, Jason Molina, and Duster incorporated its archetypical sound in their music throughout the introductory years of the 21st century, while others, including Hope Sandoval &amp; the Warm Inventions, Grouper, and Sun Kil Moon, were more experimental but remained within the genre&#x27;s confines. Because of slowcore&#x27;s broad interpretation, observers have described several other musicians and bands as slowcore, including those outside the genre.

The term &quot;slowcore&quot; derives from &quot;slow&quot;, referring to the tempo and energy of the music, and &quot;-core&quot;, which refers to a scene, style, or musical subgenre. &quot;Sadcore&quot; imitates similar etymology, and the names are used interchangeably. The term itself has an unclear origin, though sources suggest the use of &quot;slowcore&quot; started in the early 1990s. Scholars and bands alike have shown ambivalence towards the name, with some deeming it pejorative.

== Characteristics ==
Slowcore prominently incorporates stylings and traits from indie rock and contemporary folk music. Indie rock is a broad subgenre of rock music that emerged in the 1980s and encapsulates music released independently or through low-budget record labels that typically fails to appeal to mainstream audiences. Similarly, contemporary folk refers to a musical style representative of traditional folk music but with modernthe 20th century and onwardsinterpretations, ultimately spawning subgenres like folk rock and indie folk in the later stages of the century, both of which influenced slowcore to different extents. Alongside these core influences, artists often take influence from a variety of other musical genres, including alternative rock, Americana, dream pop, post-rock, and shoegaze. Drone and ambient music are also cited as being similar.

There is no definitive characterisation of the genre, however it is typically defined by slow tempos and a sombre and atmospheric approach to both the songwriting and composition. Backing instrumentation is sparse, contrasting with the genres from which slowcore is derived. Slowcore uses simple melodies over a prolonged period to evoke saddening emotions; Andrea Swensson of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote that the genre &quot;gently pulls [the listener] out of linear time&quot;. While the songs can implement choruses, they often lack intense changes in instrumentation. Chris Brokaw of Codeine facetiously remarked that he could &quot;play a snare hit, go get a drink and be back at the drumkit before the next beat&quot;. In 1998, &quot;SF Weekly&quot; wrote that &quot;The best thing about slowcore [...] is that they demand the listener pay attention. The worst thing about them is that sometimes you fall asleep by the third song&quot;.

Lyrics in slowcore songs are often melancholic, with the vocal performances subdued. For example, Swedish singer Stina Nordenstam has been described as slowcore because of &quot;her sadly beautiful little-girl whisper&quot; style of singing. Emotion is a core component of slowcore, and the sparse instrumentation emphasises the singer&#x27;s voice. Stuart Braithwaite, a founding member of the renowned post-rock band Mogwai, said &quot;You weren&#x27;t going to play [slowcore] at parties, but it was beautiful: the lyrics bare and honest, the musicality sparing&quot;.

===Sadcore===

Slowcore is occasionally referred to as &quot;sadcore&quot;, and many journalists and scholars consider the neologisms to be synonymous. When distinguished, the differences are attributed to a heightened melancholy in the lyrics of sadcore songs.

The sadcore categorisation saw considerable use in the early 2000s. Mentions include &quot;The Washington Post&quot; calling Mark Eitzel, the lead singer of American Music Club, the &quot;reluctant king of sadcore&quot; in 2002 and &quot;LA Weekly&quot; calling Charlyn Marshall (stage name Cat Power) the &quot;Queen of Sadcore&quot; in 2003. Reviewers also used it in passing for albums such as Red House Painters&#x27; &quot;Rollercoaster&quot; (1993), Shearwater&#x27;s &quot;Everybody Makes Mistakes&quot; (2002), and Low&#x27;s box set &quot;A Lifetime of Temporary Relief&quot; (2004). Since then, Lana Del Rey described her own music as &quot;Hollywood sadcore&quot; in an interview with &quot;Vogue&quot; in 2011. Phoebe Bridgers&#x27;s music has also been called sadcore, a description she dislikes: speaking to &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; in 2023, she said &quot;I hate the &#x27;sad girl&#x27; label&quot;.

==Etymology==
Within music, the suffix &quot;-core&quot; infers a scene or style, originating with &quot;hardcore&quot;. The American Dialect Society describes it more generally as a &quot;productive suffix for aesthetic trends&quot;. &quot;Slow&quot; refers to the pace of the music. For &quot;sadcore&quot;, the same applies, except &quot;sad&quot; refers to the emotion of the lyrics.

There is no definitive origin of the label &quot;slowcore&quot; outside of the agreement between scholars that its use began in the 1990s. The first instance of &quot;slowcore&quot; cited in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; is from 1991: Chuck Eddy&#x27;s book &quot;Stairway to Hell: The 500 Best Heavy Metal Albums in the Universe&quot;. Another claim to the origin of the term is from Alan Sparhawk of Low, a band often considered monumental in the growth of the genre. In an interview with &quot;The Paper Crane&quot; podcast, Sparhawk said his friend had coined the term &quot;slowcore&quot; as a joke and that he had humorously mentioned it in one of his band&#x27;s earliest shows ( 1993). He said that after he used it in an interview, the popularity of the phrase increased, as did Low&#x27;s media coverage.

===Reception===

The &quot;slowcore&quot; label has been criticised by scholars and bands, who have called it pejorative. Matt Kadane of Bedhead called it an &quot;insult&quot; and Jim Putnam of Radar Bros. resisted the term and repeatedly informed music journalists that his band was &quot;not slowcore&quot;. Similarly, members of Low disliked the label: in 1998, Sparhawk called it &quot;cheesy&quot;. Regardless, the term became increasingly popular and in an interview with &quot;Vice&quot; in 2018, Sparhawk recognised his band as being influential in slowcore&#x27;s growth and success.

== History ==
===Late 1980s: Stylistic origins===

The sound that would become known as &quot;slowcore&quot; began emerging in the United States in the late 1980s and early 1990s as a counterpoint to the rapid growth of louder rock genres, especially grunge. Grunge fused elements of punk rock and heavy metal to create a scene which Bruce Pavitt, co-founder of the record label Sub Pop, described as &quot;gritty vocals, roaring Marshall amps, ultra-loose grunge that destroyed the morals of a generation&quot;. Grunge, in the form that it came to be known, emerged during the mid-1980s in and around Seattle, Washington, though unlike grunge, the early years of slowcore did not have a defined scene or any geographic hotspots.

American Music Club, hailing from San Francisco, California, are considered an early slowcore band. Releasing their debut album &quot;The Restless Stranger&quot; in 1985, the band&#x27;s music was slow and with characteristics akin to genres like folk and singer-songwriter. This style was echoed by other bands at the time, such as the Canadian Cowboy Junkies, who were creating minimalist country and blues, and would come to define aspects of slowcore. Within the same period of time, Galaxie 500 formed in Cambridge, Massachusetts and began releasing dream pop albums. Their sophomore album, &quot;On Fire&quot; (1989), strongly influenced the genre, as did the rest of their discography, although their dream pop style was not entirely indicative of how slowcore would develop. Regardless, the band is frequently cited as one of slowcore&#x27;s leading antecedents. Andrew Earles, in his 2014 book &quot;Gimme Indie Rock: 500 Essential American Underground Rock Albums 1981-1996&quot;, described them as slowcore&#x27;s &quot;progenitor&quot;. Robert Rubsam, writing for &quot;Bandcamp Daily&quot;, called Galaxie 500 the &quot;fountainhead for all that would come&quot;.

The 1980s also saw other bands that would help define slowcore form, although many did not release any material until the 1990s. These include Codeine, Red House Painters, and Mazzy Star.

===1990s: Peak growth and evolution===
While many of the bands that influenced the concept of slowcore existed before the 1990s, this decade is often cited as being when the genre began, as well as being its heyday. Throughout this period, the amount of bands and albums associated with the genre grew greatly, establishing its fundamental sound and style.
In these early years, the genre was defined by bands that had a style of minimalist and prolonged instrumentation with melancholic vocal performances. Codeine, having formed in 1989, released &quot;Frigid Stars LP&quot; in 1990, which incorporated &quot;tortured lyrics and tired vocal melodies&quot;. Codeine&#x27;s music received attention over the following years, and after the release of the &quot;Barely Real&quot; extended play in 1992, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; described them as having a &quot;unique &#x27;slowcore&#x27; sound&quot;. By &quot;The White Birch&quot;, their 1994 sophomore and ultimate album, Codeine had cemented themselves as a prominent band within the scene. Two years after Codeine&#x27;s debut, Red House Painters, having formed in 1988, released their debut album: &quot;Down Colorful Hill&quot; (1992). Similar to other bands on the 4AD label, this album consisted of a select handful of demos that had been polished before their official release. The album is bleak in both lyrics and composition; &quot;Down Colorful Hill&quot;, alongside their following albums &quot;Rollercoaster&quot; (1993) and &quot;Bridge&quot; (1993), have been described as instilling feelings of &quot;desperation, regret, and general darkness&quot;. Earles contended that Red House Painters was the saddest band within slowcore in the early 1990s.

Another early band was Bedhead, which formed in 1991 and released &quot;WhatFunLifeWas&quot;, their debut album, in 1994. This album consisted of soft vocals and dynamic instrumentation, and the band would release two further studio albums, &quot;Beheaded&quot; (1996) and &quot;Transaction de Novo&quot; (1998), which maintained the same slow sound as their debut but deviated in technique. After this, the band disbanded and fell out of public discourse. A year after Bedhead&#x27;s formation, Idaho, another prominent band in these preliminary years, formed, and started to release music in 1993 after signing with Caroline Records. Like Bedhead, they released slowcore albums throughout the decadetheir debut being &quot;Year After Year&quot; (1993); however, Idaho persisted into the next century.

====1994-1999: Refinement of an archetypical sound====
The mid-1990s were an experimental period in music throughout North America and Europe, with new microgenres rapidly appearing. Other bands, such as Acetone, Slint, and Swans were producing slow songs that, on the outset, appeared to relate to slowcore but were better categorised under these other emerging genres. These elements resulted in slowcore being an unclearly defined and confusing genre.

Low, hailing from Duluth, Minnesota, would ultimately create the genre&#x27;s archetypical sound. Formed in 1993 by Alan Sparhawk and Mimi Parker, the band started by experimenting with slow and quiet rock music and in December 1994, released their debut album &quot;I Could Live in Hope&quot;. This album was different from its predecessors: while it maintained stylistic similarities with other bands&#x27; sparse instrumentation, it was more difficult to categorise into the other associated genres, like dream pop or shoegaze. Due to this unique sound, Low are heralded as pioneers of the genre; in their review of &quot;Trust&quot; (2002), Brad Haywood of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; proclaimed &quot;I Could Live in Hope&quot; and &quot;Long Division&quot; (1995) &quot;drew the blueprint for slowcore as we know it today&quot;. Low would continue to release slowcore albums throughout the rest of the decade and the early 2000s, after which they transitioned towards other genres.

Following Low, several bands emerged. Among them was Ida, composed of Elizabeth Mitchell and Daniel Littleton, who released their debut album, &quot;Tales of Brave Ida&quot; in 1994. This was followed by &quot;I Know About You&quot; in 1996, which Rubsam considered a slowcore &quot;classic&quot;. Ida continued to release music throughout the 1990s and into the late 2000s, with &quot;Heart Like a River&quot; from 2005 also often highlighted as an exemplary slowcore album. Bluetile Lounge, an Australian band, released their debut album (&quot;Lowercase&quot;) a year after Ida&#x27;s debut, in 1995. Also in 1995, Spain and Cat Power released their debut albums: &quot;The Blue Moods of Spain&quot; and &quot;Dear Sir&quot;, respectively. The For Carnation released their debut EP, &quot;Fight Songs&quot; the same year. Two years later, Radar Bros.&#x27;s self-titled debut album was released. These latter four bands were mentioned by Stevie Chick as examples of the way slowcore evolved after Low in an article for &quot;The Guardian&quot;. She writes, in respect of the first three: &quot;the genre grew to encompass the blue lullabies of Spain; the hypnotic intimacy of the For Carnation [...]; [and] the whispered confessions of early Cat Power&quot;. She also cites Rex, which included Codeine&#x27;s Doug Scharin, as another influential band. By the years surrounding 1996, &quot;slowcore&quot; was no longer solely an esoteric phrase; an article in &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; in May jested that Spain, among others, were playing a sort of music that &quot;new-trend-every-week folk are calling slowcore&quot;.

Nearing the end of the decade, Duster released &quot;Stratosphere&quot; (1998). By this point, the band had already released a few EPs but had failed to garner a notable reputation. The album was reviewed by &quot;Pitchfork&quot; and other zines, and the band would release one final album, &quot;Contemporary Movement&quot; (2000), before disbanding until 2018. Despite this, Duster&#x27;s initial cult following and later resurgence would ultimately make them one of the most influential bands within slowcore.

===2000s and onwards: Continued expansion===
Through the success of several bands in the mid-to-late 1990s, the slowcore sound had been conceptually established by the commencement of the 2000s. Through this, the genre continued to grow with releases from both existing and new artists. This era also saw bands experiment by amalgamating the slowcore sound with other genres.

The first few years of the century saw multiple bands release staple slowcore albums, including Duster&#x27;s &quot;Contemporary Movement&quot;, Low&#x27;s &quot;Things We Lost in the Fire&quot; (2001) and &quot;Trust&quot;, and Jason Molina, with (later called Magnolia Electric Co.), releasing &quot;Ghost Tropic&quot; (2000), &quot;Didn&#x27;t It Rain&quot; (2002), and &quot;The Magnolia Electric Co.&quot; (2003). Alongside these, new bands began venturing into the genre. Carissa&#x27;s Wierd, having formed in 1995, did not release anything until the turn of the century, when they put out &quot;Ugly But Honest: 1996-1999&quot; (2000), followed a year later by &quot;You Should Be at Home Here&quot; (2001). These albums were then succeeded in 2002 by &quot;Songs About Leaving&quot;, the band&#x27;s final album. This lattermost release was their most notable with respect to slowcore. Despite this, Carissa&#x27;s Wierd remained obscure throughout their existence, disbanding in 2003.

While albums archetypical of the mid-to-late-1990s slowcore sound were still being released during the 2000ssuch as those by Carissa&#x27;s Wierd and Lowsome bands were experimenting with introducing slowcore elements to other genres. For example, in 2002, several Red House Painters members formed Sun Kil Moon. Early on, pundits noted that this band departed from the slowcore sound present in Red House Painters releases to instead opt for folk-inspired song construction. Despite this, others continued to find similarities between Sun Kil Moon&#x27;s music and slowcore: a 2009 article in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; listed &quot;April&quot; (2008) as an essential slowcore record. Like Sun Kil Moon, Hope Sandoval &amp; the Warm Inventions comprised members of other bands. Hope Sandoval of Mazzy Star and Colm Ó Cíosóig of the shoegaze pioneering My Bloody Valentine formed this duo in 2001, and shortly after, released &quot;Bavarian Fruit Bread&quot; (2001). The album was reminiscent of dream pop, given the members&#x27; past work with other bands, but was still recognisable as slowcore. This trend continued with their second album, &quot;Through the Devil Softly&quot; (2009). This dream pop sound was revisited by Cigarettes After Sex in 2012, with their single &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Gonna Hurt You Baby&quot;. The song would go relatively unnoticed until it went viral several years later, following which the band released their self-titled debut album in 2017, described by &quot;Pitchfork&quot; as a &quot;slowcore collection [that] borders on ambient&quot;.

Slowcore increased in popularity in the early 2020s, partly through social media trends. Songs like Duster&#x27;s &quot;Constellations&quot; (from &quot;Stratosphere&quot;) have been used to soundtrack viral videos to heighten the emotion. Similarly, televisions programs used slowcore to similar effect; the Netflix drama series &quot;13 Reasons Why&quot; featured Codeine&#x27;s cover of Joy Division&#x27;s &quot;Atmosphere&quot;. Together, this usage increased public interest in slowcore, and its newfound growth allowed both existing bandslike Dusterto receive a resurgence in success and enabled new bands to emerge onto the scene. Rubsam listed Planning for Burial, Grouper, Kowloon Walled City, and Worm Ouroboros as examples of &quot;post-slow&quot; bands in his timeline of slowcore, a category &quot;reflecting a broadening and a deepening of the sound&quot;. Chick stated the &quot;genre&#x27;s influence is subtle but pervasive&quot; in modern music. Reviewers have described and labeled releases from contemporary singer-songwriters as slowcore, including those of Nicole Dollanganger, Ethel Cain, Daughter, and Snail Mail.

<text>White Zinfandel is a type of rosé wine made from red Zinfandel grapes that falls between the categories of off-dry and sweet. As it is not made from white grapes, it has a blush color, derived from grapes which are typically used to produce a full-bodied and spicy red wine called Zinfandel. 

White Zinfandel was accidentally created by Sutter Home Family Vineyards winemaker Bob Trinchero in 1975. In order to concentrate the color and flavor of some Zinfandel wine he was making he drew off some juice, which separation subsequently went through a stuck fermentation but proved saleable. In 2018, Sutter Home held a significant market share in the White Zinfandel industry, accounting for 29.1% of the total dollar sales and 73.1% of the 187 mL (6.3 U.S. fl oz) segment of the market. Other wineries and beverage manufacturers also produce and sell this variety of wine.

<text>Holon (, ) is a city in the Tel Aviv District of Israel, located south of Tel Aviv. Holon is part of the Gush Dan metropolitan area. In , it had a population of , making it the tenth most populous city in Israel. Holon has the second-largest industrial zone in Israel, after Haifa. Its jurisdiction is 19,200 dunams; as of 2018 according to CBS data, it has a population of 194,273.

==Etymology==
The name of the city comes from the Hebrew word &quot;holon&quot;, meaning &quot;(little) sand&quot;. The name Holon also appears in the Bible: &quot;And Holon with its suburbs, and Debir with its suburbs&quot; (Book of Joshua 21:15).

==History==
Holon was founded in 1935 on sand dunes six kilometers () from Tel Aviv. The Łódzia textile factory was established there by Jewish immigrants from Łódź, Poland, along with many other industrial enterprises. In February 1936, the cornerstone was laid for Kiryat Avoda, a Modernist building complex designed by architect Joseph Neufeld to solve the shortage of housing for municipal workers.

In the early months of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Holon was on the front line, with constant shooting taking place on the border with the village of Tel al-Rish to its northwest—a suburb of Arab Jaffa—and clashes also in the direction of the town of Yazur to the east. An attack by the Holon-based Haganah militia units on Tel A-Rish was repulsed with considerable losses. 

After the establishment of the state, Holon expanded to include Tel A-Rish (renamed &quot;Tel Giborim&quot;, &quot;The Mound of the Heroes&quot;) and the orange groves of Yazur.

In February 2001, a Palestinian attack at a crowded bus stop in Holon killed eight Israelis and injured twenty-five. The image of Holon as a working-class dormitory community has changed over the years. 

Through municipal efforts, the city has been rebranded as a child-friendly city. It offers family attractions such as the Yamit Water Park, the Israeli Children&#x27;s Museum, and the Israel Museum of Caricature and Comics.
Historic landmarks in Holon slated for preservation include Derech Habitachon (&quot;Safe Road&quot;), paved during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War; water towers in the Moledet and Azor neighborhoods; Hosmasa, a building used by the Haganah; the pillbox guard post; Stroma Square, Mansbach health clinic, Hameshakem building, the Agrobank neighborhood and two schools – Bialik and Shenkar. A new neighborhood, Migdalim Bashdera, is under construction, with plans for 23 upscale residential towers, a new city hall, several cultural and commercial centers, some of them already built. A French urban planner was commissioned to design a north-south boulevard with pedestrian walks, bicycle paths, sports fields, parks and waterfalls.
The last undeveloped land reserve remaining in Holon is the H-500 Holon plan, that consists of approximately 4,080 dunams in the south of the city, and is intended to consist of 13,700 dwelling units in total.

<text>This article lists software emulators.

==Central processing units==

===ARM===
* ARMulator
* Aemulor
* QEMU

===MIPS===
* SPIM: The OVPsim 500 mips MIPS32 emulator, can be used to develop software using virtual platforms, emulators including MIPS processors running at up to 500 MIPS, the processor is capable of running many OSes including Linux. OVP is used to build emulators of single MIPS processors or multiple - homogeneous MP or heterogenous MP.

===x86 architecture===
* Bochs
* DOSBox
* FX!32
* PCem
* QEMU – an opensource emulator that emulates 7 architectures including ARM, x86, MIPS, and others
* box86
* Rosetta 2: Apple&#x27;s emulator for macOS allowing to run x86_64 applications on arm64 platform

===Motorola 680x0===
* Mac 68K emulator: For PowerPC classic Mac OS

===PowerPC===
* PearPC
* Rosetta: Apple&#x27;s emulator for PowerPC processors, built into Mac OS X
* WarpUP: Amiga system for PowerPC expansion cards built into MorphOS and available for AmigaOS
* SheepShaver: Emulates the PowerPC processor. Can run Mac OS 7 to Mac OS 9.

===RISC-V===
* QEMU

==Computer system emulators==
==Full system simulators==
* Simics
* CPU Sim: A Java application that allows the user to design and create a simple architecture and instruction set and then run programs of instructions from the set through simulation
* GXemul: Framework for full-system computer architecture emulation

==Mobile phones and PDAs==

* Adobe Device Central
* BlueStacks
* NoxPlayer
* Palm OS Emulator
* touchHLE
* Windows Subsystem for Android

==Multi-system emulators==
* blueMSX: Emulates Z80 based computers and consoles
* MAME: Emulates multiple arcade machines, video game consoles and computers
* DAPHNE is an arcade emulator application that emulates a variety of laserdisc video games with the intent of preserving these games and making the play experience as faithful to the originals as possible. The developer calls DAPHNE the &quot;First Ever Multiple Arcade Laserdisc Emulator&quot; (&quot;FEMALE&quot;). It derives its name from Princess Daphne, the heroine of &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot;. HYPSEUS is a modern SDL2 update to the DAPHNE emulator, named after a sibling to Daphne.

==Network emulators==
* ns-2
* Cisco Packet Tracer
* Router Sim

==Operating system emulators==

===Unix===
* Cygwin: For Microsoft Windows, provides a POSIX environment and system libraries (contained in cygwin.dll). This does not allow one to run unaltered Linux/Unix binaries. However, it allows use of the gcc compiler collection to compile software written for these operating systems from source code.

:In addition to the POSIX system, Cygwin includes a package manager that connects to a repository with 9000+ software packages. Users can optionally use Cygwin ports repository which includes &gt;2300 (86x64) to &gt;2700 (86x32) additional software packages not included in the RedHat-hosted repository, including many GUI applications.

:The repository contains a wide range of software, including Bash (command shell and scripting environment comparable to the Windows Powershell), the GNU compiler collection with the complete tool chain. In addition, the &#x27;usual and customary&#x27; programming languages installed with a Linux distribution, including C, C++, Python, PHP, Perl, Tcl/Tk, and Lua are available, along with multiple development libraries.

:In addition to Bash, the GNU Utilities (e.g. find utilities, such as locate, find, grep) are installed by default. Hundreds of other software packages are included, many with non-POSIX Windows implementation, such as database management systems (PostgreSQL, MySQL), web servers (e.g. Apache HTTP Server), firewalls, text processing utilities, and console mode applications. In addition, there is a (reasonably stable) X.org/X11 implementation with GTK and Qt libraries. Based on these, graphic desktop managers, including GNOME, LXDE, LXQt, KDE, and others (e.g. x2go) with associated graphic user applications with variable stability and functionality.

===Windows===
* WINE: Available for most POSIX compliant (Unix-like) operating systems, such as Linux, BSD, and macOS (Darling and Darwine projects). It provides a Win32 API and cleanroom implementation of the associated functionality. In contrast to Cygwin, WINE enables the installation and use of unaltered Windows software. Considerable effort has been put into support for video games, including third-party extensions (e.g. PlayOnLinux) which provide custom Windows configurations known to work with a very large list of videogames. In addition, desktop productivity software, including MS Office, is supported. Because of the lack of dependence on the Windows registry, inclusion of statically linked libraries, and (at least in part) historic development from open source projects, portable application, such as the PortableApps platform and the 300+ available software applications which can be downloaded with it, work with little or no issues.

<doc id="231887" wikidata="Q444358" url="?curid=231887" title="Dandelion and burdock">
<text>Dandelion and burdock is a beverage originating and commonly consumed in the British Isles since the Middle Ages. It was originally a type of light mead but over the years has evolved into the carbonated soft drink commercially available today. Traditionally, it was made from fermented dandelion (&quot;Taraxacum officinale&quot;) and burdock (&quot;Arctium lappa&quot;) roots, hence the name.

==History==
Dandelion and burdock shares an origin with a number of drinks originally made from lightly fermented root extracts, such as root beer and sarsaparilla, supposedly as a health benefit. The dominant flavour in these other drinks is usually sassafras or wintergreen, both now derived artificially rather than from the plant itself, in part because during the 1960s, safrole, the major component of the volatile oil of sassafras, was found to be carcinogenic in rats. All of these drinks, while tasting similar, do have their own distinct flavour. Dandelion and burdock is most similar in flavour to sarsaparilla.

==Imitations and variants==
Ben Shaw, a Huddersfield businessman, founded a company that made and sold the drink, first in Yorkshire and then throughout Britain, between 1871 and 1993. Afterward, the enterprise passed through several hands and is now owned by Refresco, who still make and sell the drink.

Fentimans, a beverage company based in the United Kingdom, offers a version of the naturally brewed dandelion and burdock drink, containing extracts of both plants (although its main ingredients are sugar and pear juice concentrate).

A.G. Barr, known for its Scottish soft drink Irn-Bru, produces a version of dandelion and burdock under the name &quot;D&#x27;n&#x27;B&quot;, with the slogan &quot;Tall, dark and drinksome&quot;.

The last of the UK&#x27;s original temperance bars, Fitzpatrick&#x27;s in Rawtenstall, Rossendale, which opened in 1890, still produces its dandelion and burdock to an original recipe brought over from Ireland at the end of the 19th century.

<text>The Reliant Scimitar name was used for a series of sports car models produced by British car manufacturer Reliant between 1964 and 1986. During its 22-year production it evolved from a coupe (GT) into a sports estate (GTE), with a convertible variant (GTC) launched in 1980. All have a fibreglass body mounted on a steel box-section chassis, and Ford engines.

==Scimitar GT SE4 (1964–1970)==

Reliant&#x27;s first Scimitar was a coupé based upon the styling of a Daimler SP250 prototype (renamed the SX250) and the chassis of a Reliant Sabre. It was first displayed in 1964. It was powered by a 2.6-litre Ford straight six from the Ford Zephyr and Zodiac. In order to keep cost down, many components in addition to the engine were existing ones originally designed for competitor models, a point emphasized for buyers of the early Scimitars in which unfolding the sun visor involved knocking the rearview mirror out of adjustment.

In 1966 the SE4A was replaced by the SE4B, with a 3.0 L V6 Ford &quot;Essex&quot; engine. A year later, in September 1967, the cheaper SE4C was introduced with a 2.5-litre version of the same engine and a reduction of £105 on the recommended retail price. The engine differed from the one fitted on the Ford Zephyr 6 in that the Reliant engine came with an alternator whereas Ford buyers had to be content with a dynamo.

Just over 1000 SE4s were produced.

===1964: Scimitar GT SE4===
Scimitar Coupe with 2.6-litre straight six engine

As the Sabre 6 began looking a bit dated, managing director Ray Wiggin started looking for a new design. While at the 1962 Motor Show, he saw a car called an Ogle SX250: it had been designed by David Ogle (of David Ogle Associates, later known as Ogle Design) and it was based on the Daimler Dart SP250 chassis and running gear. The car had been privately commissioned by Boris Forter, managing director of the Helena Rubenstein Company (UK), who later had another one built for his girlfriend.

Daimler didn&#x27;t use the design, so Reliant approached Ogle and asked to buy the rights for it. Some subtle changes were made to the bodyshell and it was further modified to fit the Reliant Sabre chassis and running gear.

The new Scimitar GT car retained the straight-six engine from the Sabre, but with triple SU carburettors as standard it now produced 120 bhp and propelled the car to a top speed of . It was launched at the Earls Court Motor Show in 1964; it was praised for its elegant lines and performance figures for a price of £1,292. The price included wire wheels and a luxurious interior with comprehensive instrumentation. Optional extras included a choice of De Normanville overdrive unit, electric sunroof and ZF gearbox. Reliant produced approximately 296 straight-six Scimitar GTs.

===1966: Scimitar GT SE4A/B===
Scimitar coupé with 3-litre V6 Essex engine (approximately 591 built)

In late 1966 Ford dropped the 2.6-litre Straight Six engine and replaced it with the new 3-litre Essex V6 engine (as used in the latest MK IV Ford Zodiac). This meant that Reliant had to do a good deal of development work to the existing Scimitar GT to enable the new more powerful engine to fit and obtain best performance and handling.

As the Essex engine was shorter, it was mounted further back in the bulkhead to help improve weight distribution. The lower wishbones were re-positioned, the tower structures and cross members were reinforced and an anti-roll bar was fitted. Other modifications included replacing the wire wheels with wider steel wheels as standard, and the fitting of a higher-ratio rear axle (3.58:1 instead of 3.875:1).

The interior was updated to move with the times. There was now an all-anti-dazzle-black interior (including black instrument dial bezels instead of the previous chrome versions). The padded fascia board had crash pads at the top and bottom, and improvements were made with the ventilation by fitting directionally variable ventilator jets, as used by Ford.

This is what Autocar said about the new 3-litre Scimitar GT on 12 January 1967:

&quot;&quot;At a Glance – High performance 2+2 coupe. Lusty, low revving engine in conjunction with high gearing gives effortless cruising at three-figure speeds. Good gear change, but rather wide ratios. Smooth, light clutch. Ride and handling very good, and much improved over the earlier car. Light, accurate steering and first class brakes with powerful servo. Ventilation improved but still not ideal. Fuel and range very good&quot;.&quot;

===1967: Scimitar GT SE4C===
Scimitar coupé with 2.5-litre V6 Essex engine (118 built)

Reliant introduced their third and final version of the V6 Scimitar GT in late 1967. To widen its appeal they launched a slightly less powerful Scimitar GT.

Using Ford&#x27;s 2.5-litre version of the V6 Essex engine meant that the car could still reach speeds of over , have slightly better fuel economy, but ultimately reduce the cost to the public by approx £120.
Externally, the only difference between the 3-litre and 2.5-litre versions was the small badge on the boot giving the engine size. Approximately 118 of the 2.5-litre Scimitar GTs were sold before this version was withdrawn. Production of the standard Scimitar GT continued until November 1970.

==Scimitar GTE SE5 (1968–1972) and SE5A (1972–1975)==

Tom Karen of Ogle was asked to submit some body designs based on the &quot;Ogle Design GTS&quot; estate car experiment for a new four-seater Scimitar, the SE5 Reliant Scimitar. Managing Director Ray Wiggin, Chief Engineer John Crosthwaite and fibreglass body expert Ken Wood went to Ogle&#x27;s in Letchworth to view some mock-up body designs for the new SE5. Wiggin told Wood to proceed with a proper master.

The SE5 was conceived and ready for the 1968 Motor Show in less than 12 months. For the SE5 John Crosthwaite and his team designed a completely different longer chassis frame, revised suspension, new and relocated fuel tank, a rollover bar, new cooling system, spare wheel mounted in the nose to give increased rear space and a fuel tank. When designing the chassis Crosthwaite worked closely with Ogle body stylist Peter Bailey to modify and refine the prototype.

The main change introduced in the SE5 was the sports estate hatchback body shape, although other car manufacturers had also produced hatchback models.

The SE5 came with the same 3.0-litre Ford Essex engine used in the SE4a/b. This gave the SE5 a claimed top speed of over . A Borg-Warner 35 automatic transmission was added as an option in 1970 and by 1971, overdrive on the 4-speed manual was offered. In 1972 several improvements were included in the upgrade to SE5A, including a boost in power. The extra 7 hp (5 kW) and maximum engine speed raised performance and the GTE was now capable of in 8.5 seconds and top speed was raised to . The SE5&#x27;s flat dashboard also gave way to a curved and moulded plastic one.
 The SE5A can be recognised from a SE5 at the rear by the reverse lamps which are below the bumper on the earlier model and are incorporated into the rear clusters on the later version (these were also carried over onto the SE6 and later). Badging changes included changing the &quot;SCIMITAR&quot; lettering from a narrow type-style to a fatter one.

Directly following the announcement of the car, Autocar magazine tested a 3-litre GTE (with manual transmission) in October 1968. They reported a maximum speed of and a time of 10.7 seconds. Overall fuel consumption for the test came in at 18.5 mpg. The manufacturer&#x27;s UK market recommended retail price, including sales taxes, was £1,759. The 3-litre MG MGC GT was retailing at this time for £1,337 while Rover&#x27;s 3500 was offered for £1,791. Launch of the more directly comparable Volvo 1800ES was still four years away.

4,311 SE5s were produced. It was an instant success; GT production was cut down and the proportion of GTEs to GTs being built was four-to-one. Reliant increased its volume by 20% in the first year. The 5A model sold more than any other Scimitar, with 5105 manufactured. Princess Anne was given a manual overdrive SE5 as a joint 20th birthday present and Christmas present in November 1970 by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. It was Air Force blue in colour with a grey leather interior and registered 1420 H in recognition of her position as Colonel-in-Chief of the 14th/20th Hussars. Anne subsequently owned eight other GTEs.
==Scimitar GTE SE6 (1975–1976), SE6A (1976–1980) and SE6B (1980–1986)==

More of a luxury model than the SE5, the SE6 series was promoted to the executive market. These models were two-door sports estates, again with the Ford V6 3.0 L engine as used in the SE5A with 135 bhp,: the wheelbase was increased by and the track by making the cars correspondingly longer and wider than their predecessors. The extra length was used to improve rear-seat legroom and access which enhanced the car&#x27;s credentials as a &#x27;genuine&#x27; four-seater. Noticeable changes from the earlier models were the increase in the outer headlamp size from 5.3/4&quot; to 7&quot; and the replacement of the chrome plated bumpers with rubber ones. A Laycock overdrive on third and fourth gear was optional. The SE6 was replaced by the SE6A in late 1976. 543 SE6 models were produced.

The SE6A displayed a number of changes, including Lockheed brakes and suspension revisions. An easy way to spot a SE6A from a SE6 is the change to orange from red reflectors on the rear extractor vents, and the three vertical grooves in the front bumper (in front of the wheel arches) were removed. 3877 SE6As were made—making it the most popular version of all the SE6 shape.

Ford had stopped making the Essex engine for the Capri by 1981, and production stopped completely in 1988 so one of the major differences with the SE6B was the engine. The German-built Ford Cologne 2.8 L V6 was used instead (thus the chassis on the 6B differs from the 6/6A at the front) and provided similar power, but rather less torque at low revs. The final drive ratio was lowered from 3.31:1 to 3.54:1 to compensate. When tested by Autocar in 1981, a Scimitar GTE with the 2.8 L engine and automatic transmission achieved a 0–60 mph (97 km/h) time of 10.8 seconds and a top speed of . All SE6Bs (and the SE8) were equipped with the quite troublesome Pierburg/Solex carburetted engines (many owners have changed to the Weber 38DGAS from the Essex engine) and although the battery was moved from the SE6/SE6A position to allow for injection equipment to be fitted, none ever left the factory so fitted. Some late versions (around 1983 on) came with the galvanised chassis as standard but the exact numbers and chassis details are vague.

Introduced at the 1980 Geneva Motor Show, only 407 SE6Bs were manufactured. Production ceased by 1986.
==Scimitar GTC SE8 (1980–1986)==

Reliant began planning a convertible in 1977 and commissioned Ogle Design to create a proposal. Tom Karen adapted his earlier GTE design and created a four-seater convertible with a good-sized boot. From the B-post back, all of the panels were new, with extra bracing introduced between the rear side panels and door hinge plates running under the dashboard. The roll hoop from the GTE was retained, and for additional support this was linked to extra tubes running around the front screen creating a Triumph Stag-like T-bar design that would ensure the rigidity of the new body design. As the car sported a separate chassis and the extra bracing, it did not suffer from the scuttle shake that unibody convertibles could be prone to suffer.
The hood was designed in house by adapting the hood frame from a Triumph Stag, with a bespoke cover made of mohair.
A prototype car was produced in 1978 and was powered by a 3.0 Essex engine. Later Reliant replaced it with a 2.8 Cologne engine, because Ford had withdrawn its Essex engines from the European market in favour of the Cologne unit. This was slightly down on torque compared to the Essex engine, so to improve performance Reliant changed the final drive ratio from 3.31 to 3.54. The GTC was launched in March 1980, with a hardtop added after the Birmingham Motor Show that year. While it was well received by the motoring press, in 1980 the country was heading into a recession and Reliant struggled to sell its £11,360 convertibles in great numbers. As a result, many cars were left sitting at the factory for months until owners could be found. By 1986 the Scimitar GTC cost 20% more than a Ford Escort XR3i Cabriolet, a similar offering in respect of seats and performance.

* A total of 442 production GTCs were manufactured by Reliant (+ 1 prototype)
* 340 were manufactured in 1980 (the first year of production)
* Factory galvanised chassis from production number 372 – 442 (earlier cars had a painted steel chassis)
* 3 were manufactured in 1981, 20 in 1982, 24 in 1983, 29 in 1984, 13 in 1985, 13 in 1986
* Most of the cars registered in 1981 were actually manufactured in 1980
* The GTC is lighter than the SE6B GTE on which it is based
* The GTC was 10% more expensive than the SE6B in 1980
* In 1980 a GTC would have cost £11,360, equivalent to more than £40,000 now

<doc id="231891" wikidata="Q2298542" url="?curid=231891" title="Look Sharp! (Joe Jackson album)">
<text>Look Sharp! is the debut album by Joe Jackson, released in January 1979. The album features one of Jackson&#x27;s most well-known songs, &quot;Is She Really Going Out with Him?&quot;, as well as the title track &quot;Look Sharp&quot;, &quot;Sunday Papers&quot;, &quot;One More Time&quot; and &quot;Fools in Love&quot;.

The cover, featuring a pair of white shoes, ranked number 22 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 100 greatest album covers of all time.

In 2000, it was voted number 865 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

==Background==
Joe Jackson and his band, using money earned by Jackson from touring with the cabaret band Koffee &#x27;n&#x27; Kream, began recording the album from autumn 1977 to spring 1978 in a studio in Portsmouth. However, after producer David Kershenbaum heard a demo tape from Jackson, he signed Jackson to A&amp;M Records in 1978, after which Jackson and his band quickly re-recorded the album. This was then followed by a tour to promote the record.

&quot;Look Sharp!&quot; was heavily influenced by reggae music, which, in a June 1979 interview, Jackson said he was &quot;totally immersed in&quot;. Jackson also sought to capture a spontaneous feel on the album; he reflected at the time, &quot;A lot of the tracks are first takes and there are no overdubs, though we think now it is a bit thin. We wanted a bit more live band sort of sound. In retrospect you always feel there&#x27;s something you can improve on. Next time &#x27;round we&#x27;ll feature the guitar a bit more&quot;.

Jackson later spoke negatively of &quot;Pretty Girls&quot;, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s all about pretty girls walking down the street and, Oh wow, isn&#x27;t that a turn-on. In retrospect, it&#x27;s kind of a stinker. It&#x27;s embarrassing—ogling girls, I mean, that&#x27;s kind of lame. It&#x27;s just childish and silly and derivative, but I was 22 when I wrote it. Not everyone can be a prodigy!&quot;

==Release==
&quot;Is She Really Going Out with Him?&quot; was released as a single in the UK prior to the release of &quot;Look Sharp!&quot;, but it, as well as follow-ups &quot;Sunday Papers&quot; and &quot;One More Time,&quot; failed to make an impact on the charts. &quot;Look Sharp!&quot; also stalled upon its initial release, but upon the re-release of &quot;Is She Really Going Out with Him?&quot; in Britain (as well as a single release in the US), the album grew in popularity, reaching the top #20 in America. After the performance of the first album, the band quickly recorded a follow-up, &quot;I&#x27;m the Man&quot;, which has been described by Jackson as &quot;Part Two of &quot;Look Sharp!&quot;&quot; since its release. The album was particularly well-received in Canada where it was certified platinum by November 1979.

==Artwork==
The photo used on the album&#x27;s cover was shot by Brian Griffin on London&#x27;s South Bank, near London Waterloo station. Upon arriving at the South Bank, Griffin noticed a shaft of light landing on the ground and asked Jackson to stand there: the whole process took no more than five minutes. According to Griffin, Jackson hated the record sleeve as it did not include his face, and vowed never to work with Griffin again. Nonetheless, the album artwork became one of the nominees for the 1980 Grammy Award for Best Recording Package.

Some observers didn&#x27;t understand the tongue-in-cheek nature of Jackson&#x27;s choice of title and cover art—an early reviewer in &quot;New Musical Express&quot; said they &quot;suggest an obsession with style&quot; and sniffed that Jackson sported &quot;a pair of white side-lace Denson winklepickers that are, unfortunately, not nearly as cool as he evidently thinks they are&quot;. As time went on, journalists became more familiar with his youthful lack of interest in fashion, and &quot;The Face&quot; noted how most agreed with the general summation of him as a &quot;sartorial disaster area&quot;.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Look Sharp!&quot; has seen critical acclaim since its release. In a five star review, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; compared the album to the best works of Jackson&#x27;s contemporary Elvis Costello, commenting, &quot;Though Jackson would never achieve Costello&#x27;s cachet, his early work holds up alongside that of his rival.&quot; John Rockwell in &quot;The New York Times&quot; picked it as the ninth best album of that year, stating that it was &quot;Power pop at its refreshing best.&quot; In a later review, Allmusic was similarly complimentary, stating, &quot;&quot;Look Sharp!&quot; is the sound of a young man searching for substance in a superficial world -- and it also happens to rock like hell.&quot; &quot;Paste&quot; named &quot;Look Sharp!&quot; the 17th best new wave album, with staff writer Mark Lore stating that it &quot;ranks right up there with early records from another brainy, pissed-off songwriter called Elvis Costello, bursting with frustration and spazzy pop songs&quot;.

Jackson&#x27;s own opinion on the album was mixed, with the artist later claiming that &quot;I&#x27;m the Man&quot; and 2003&#x27;s &quot;Volume 4&quot; were better albums overall. He later said on his website,

==Alternative releases==
&quot;Look Sharp!&quot; was re-released in 2001 with two bonus tracks, &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask Me&quot; and &quot;You Got the Fever&quot;, the respective B-sides of the singles &quot;One More Time&quot; and &quot;Is She Really Going Out with Him?&quot;, originally released in May 1979 and October 1978. In addition to the standard 12-inch vinyl release, the record was also released in a special package on two 10-inch discs that also included a &quot;Look Sharp!&quot; badge.

<text>Outlandos d&#x27;Amour (&quot;Outlaws of Love&quot;) is the debut studio album by British rock band the Police, released on 17 November 1978 by A&amp;M Records. Elevated by the success of its lead single, &quot;Roxanne&quot;, &quot;Outlandos d&#x27;Amour&quot; peaked at No. 6 on the UK Albums Chart and at No. 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album spawned two additional hit singles: &quot;Can&#x27;t Stand Losing You&quot; and &quot;So Lonely&quot;.

Although &quot;Outlandos d&#x27;Amour&quot; received mixed reviews upon its release, it has since been regarded as one of the strongest debut albums. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it as the 38th best debut album of all time and the 428th greatest album of all time.

==Background and recording==
On a budget of £1,500 (£ in ) borrowed from their manager, Miles Copeland (brother of drummer Stewart), the Police recorded &quot;Outlandos d&#x27;Amour&quot; at Surrey Sound Studios in an intermittent fashion over six months, with the band recording whenever the studio had free time or another band&#x27;s sessions were cancelled. Miles Copeland had promised to pay Surrey Sound £2,000 upon completion of the recording, but did not give them the full amount until much later.

Miles occasionally visited the studio during recording, and he reacted to what he heard from the band with vehement derision. However, upon hearing &quot;Roxanne&quot; he had the opposite reaction and took the recording to A&amp;M Records the following day, where he persuaded the record label to release it as a one-off single. Although the single failed to chart, A&amp;M agreed to give the band a second chance with &quot;Can&#x27;t Stand Losing You&quot;. At first, A&amp;M proposed the band create an improved mix of the song, but after five attempts admitted that it could not improve upon the band&#x27;s mix, and released the original mix for the single. When it became the band&#x27;s first hit, the label quickly approved the release of the by-then finished album.

Miles had originally wanted to name the album &quot;Police Brutality&quot;. However, after hearing &quot;Roxanne&quot; and then envisioning a more romantic image for the band, he proposed &quot;Outlandos d&#x27;Amour&quot; instead. This title is a loose French translation of &quot;Outlaws of Love&quot;, with the first word being a combination of the words &quot;outlaws&quot; and &quot;commandos&quot;, and &quot;d&#x27;Amour&quot; meaning &quot;of love&quot;.

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;Outlandos d&#x27;Amour&quot;, while at times incorporating reggae, pop and other elements of what would eventually become the band&#x27;s definitive sound, is dominated by punk influences. This is evident on the opening track &quot;Next to You&quot;, despite it essentially being a love song. Stewart Copeland and guitarist Andy Summers initially felt the lyrics were neither aggressive nor political enough for their style at the time, but bassist and vocalist Sting was adamant about keeping the song as it was. &quot;Next to You&quot; includes a slide guitar solo by Summers, which Copeland initially dismissed as &quot;old wave&quot;.

The second track is the reggae-influenced &quot;So Lonely&quot;. Sting has said he used Bob Marley&#x27;s &quot;No Woman, No Cry&quot; as the musical basis for the song, while the lyrics in its verses were recycled from &quot;Fool in Love&quot;, a song he originally wrote for his earlier band Last Exit. The song itself, about someone who is lonely after suffering a broken heart, was seen as ironic by a large segment of the band&#x27;s listeners. Sting disagreed with this sentiment, saying, &quot;No, there&#x27;s no irony whatsoever. From the outside it might look a bit strange, being surrounded by all this attention and yet experiencing the worst lonely feeling ... but I do. And then suddenly the attention is withdrawn a half an hour later. You&#x27;re so isolated ...&quot;

&quot;Roxanne&quot; was written by Sting after visiting a red-light district near the band&#x27;s hotel in Paris. The Police had been staying there in October 1977 to perform at the nearby Nashville Club. The song&#x27;s title comes from the name of the character in the play &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;, an old poster of which was hanging in the hotel foyer. Sting had originally conceived the song as a bossa nova, although Stewart Copeland has been credited for suggesting its final rhythmic form as a tango. During recording, Sting accidentally sat down on a piano keyboard in the studio, resulting in the atonal chord and laughter preserved at the beginning of the track. The Police were initially reluctant about the song, but Miles Copeland was immediately enthusiastic after hearing it.

The remaining two tracks on the first side of the album are &quot;Hole in My Life&quot;, another reggae-influenced song by Sting, and &quot;Peanuts&quot;, a composition written by Stewart Copeland and Sting about Rod Stewart. The lyrics were meant as an expression of disappointment on Sting&#x27;s part towards his former idol, of whom he said: &quot;I used to be a great fan of his but something happened to him. I hope I don&#x27;t end up like that.&quot; Having since experienced the celebrity lifestyle himself, he has said he no longer identifies with the song&#x27;s lyrical content and has come to view Stewart in a different light.

&quot;Can&#x27;t Stand Losing You&quot; begins side two of the original LP. Written and composed by Sting, the song is about a young lover being driven to suicide following a breakup. In a 1993 interview with &quot;The Independent&quot;, he described the lyrics as &quot;juvenile&quot;, saying that &quot;teenage suicide ... is always a bit of a joke&quot;; he also claimed to have written the lyrics in only five minutes.

The following track, &quot;Truth Hits Everybody&quot;, is a punk-influenced song. After that is &quot;Born in the 50&#x27;s&quot;, which details life as a teenager during the 1960s. &quot;Be My Girl—Sally&quot; is a medley of a half-finished song by Sting and an Andy Summers poem about a blow-up doll. This leads into the semi-instrumental closer, &quot;Masoko Tanga&quot;, the only song on the album to not become a staple of the band&#x27;s live performances.

Two other songs from these sessions were excluded from &quot;Outlandos d&#x27;Amour&quot; but released as B-sides for two of its singles: &quot;Dead-End Job&quot;, a song credited to Sting and Copeland, on the B-side of &quot;Can&#x27;t Stand Losing You&quot;; and &quot;No Time This Time&quot; by Sting, on the B-side of &quot;So Lonely&quot;. The latter was subsequently included on the band&#x27;s second album &quot;Reggatta de Blanc&quot;.

==Release==
Released on 3 November 1978, &quot;Outlandos d&#x27;Amour&quot; initially performed poorly due to low exposure and an unfavourable reaction from the BBC to its first two singles, &quot;Roxanne&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Stand Losing You&quot;, owing to their subject matter (prostitution and suicide, respectively). The latter was banned by the BBC specifically due to its single cover, which depicted Stewart Copeland &quot;standing on a block of ice with a noose around his neck, waiting for the ice to melt.&quot; The record company took notice of the notoriety and in response promoted the band&#x27;s music with posters detailing how the BBC had banned &quot;Roxanne&quot;. &quot;Roxanne&quot; failed to chart in the United Kingdom upon its original release in April 1978. &quot;Can&#x27;t Stand Losing You&quot;, released in August, became the group&#x27;s first single to break the UK singles chart, reaching No. 42 in October. &quot;So Lonely&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s third single in November 1978, and did not chart.

The Police&#x27;s low-budget tour of the United States in support of the album made people across the country aware of the band, and especially &quot;Roxanne&quot;, which was released as their first single there. &quot;Roxanne&quot; charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in February 1979, peaking at No. 32 in April of the same year. It was also successful in Canada, where it peaked at No. 31. The song received increasing airplay from radio DJs in both the US and the UK throughout April 1979.

The international success of &quot;Roxanne&quot; spurred a UK reissue of the single in April 1979, which went to No. 12 on the UK singles chart. A subsequent reissue of &quot;Can&#x27;t Stand Losing You&quot; in June 1979 nearly topped the chart, surpassed only by &quot;I Don&#x27;t Like Mondays&quot; by the Boomtown Rats. &quot;So Lonely&quot; was also reissued, reaching No. 6 on the UK singles chart in February 1980.

The album itself eventually peaked at No. 6 on the UK Albums Chart in October 1979. In the US, &quot;Outlandos d&#x27;Amour&quot; peaked at number 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1981 for sales of over 500,000 copies in the United States, and in 1984, the album attained platinum certification after shipping one million units. It is the Police&#x27;s only album not to reach the top position in the UK.

&quot;Can&#x27;t Stand Losing You&quot; briefly returned to the charts in 1980 as part of the &quot;Six Pack&quot; singles compilation set, which peaked at No. 17 on the UK singles chart in June 1980. In 1995, a live version of the song was released as a single and reached No. 27 on the chart.

==Critical reception==
Contemporary reviews of the album were largely unfavourable. Tom Carson of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; had high praise for the band&#x27;s technical abilities, but was disparaging of their attempt to tackle sophisticated rock and reggae while posturing as punks. Carson also perceived a lack of emotional conviction on the album, especially in Sting&#x27;s vocals, concluding that &quot;&quot;Outlandos d&#x27;Amour&quot; isn&#x27;t monotonous—it&#x27;s far too jumpy and brittle for that—but its mechanically minded emptiness masquerading as feeling makes you feel cheated ... worn out by all the supercilious, calculated pretense.&quot; Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; was more positive. He complimented the band&#x27;s &quot;tuneful, straight-ahead rock and roll&quot; and wrote that almost all of the album&#x27;s songs &quot;make the cretin in me hop&quot;, though only &quot;Can&#x27;t Stand Losing You&quot; &quot;makes him jump up and down&quot;. In &quot;Sounds&quot;, Phil Sutcliffe viewed &quot;Outlandos d&#x27;Amour&quot; as &quot;a distinctive and mostly enjoyable first album&quot; and credited the band for not excessively flaunting their musical virtuosity, noting that they instead &quot;emphasise starkness and tension, taking the bare framework of punk or reggae as their starting point.&quot;

Subsequent retrospective reviews have been more favourable towards the album. Greg Prato of AllMusic called &quot;Outlandos d&#x27;Amour&quot; &quot;by far [the Police&#x27;s] most direct and straightforward release&quot; and &quot;unquestionably one of the finest debuts to come out of the &#x27;70s punk/new wave movement&quot;, writing that even many of the lesser-known cuts are outstanding. By 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; had reversed their original position on &quot;Outlandos d&#x27;Amour&quot; by ranking the record at No. 434 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and at No. 428 on the 2012 revised edition of the list. The magazine also ranked &quot;Outlandos d&#x27;Amour&quot; at No. 38 on its 2013 list of the 100 best debut albums of all time, describing the band as &quot;post-punks who could play their instruments, absorbing reggae and jazz into the spare, bouncy sound of their debut album, a record that didn&#x27;t sound quite like anything before it.&quot;

<doc id="231896" wikidata="Q847683" url="?curid=231896" title="Reggatta de Blanc">
<text>Reggatta de Blanc is the second studio album by British rock band the Police, released on 5 October 1979 by A&amp;M Records. It was the band&#x27;s first release to top the UK Albums Chart and features their first two UK number-one singles: &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; and &quot;Walking on the Moon&quot;. In early 1980, the album was reissued in the United States on two 10-inch discs, one album side per disc, and as a collector&#x27;s edition with a poster of the band.

The album&#x27;s title loosely translates in French to &quot;White Reggae&quot;. It was the band&#x27;s second album to bear a Franglais title, after their 1978 debut album &quot;Outlandos d&#x27;Amour&quot;. &quot;Reggatta de Blanc&quot; proved more popular and successful than its predecessor. The title track earned the band their first Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.

In 2003, &quot;Reggatta de Blanc&quot; was ranked at number 369 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

==Background==
&quot;Reggatta de Blanc&quot; took four weeks to record, spaced over several months. Unlike its successor, &quot;Zenyatta Mondatta&quot;, there was no pressure on the band. Of the sessions, drummer Stewart Copeland said, &quot;We just went into the studio and said, &#x27;Right, who&#x27;s got the first song?&#x27; We hadn&#x27;t even rehearsed them before we went in.&quot;

Against the wishes of A&amp;M Records, who had wanted to equip the promising band with a bigger studio and more famous producer, the Police opted to again record at Surrey Sound with Nigel Gray. The small budget (between £6,000 and £9,000) was easily covered by the profits of their previous album, &quot;Outlandos d&#x27;Amour&quot;, further ensuring that the record label would have no control over the actual creation of the band&#x27;s music.

Whereas &quot;Outlandos d&#x27;Amour&quot; had benefited from one of the most prolific songwriting periods of Sting&#x27;s life, the recording sessions for &quot;Reggatta de Blanc&quot; were so short on new material that the band even considered re-recording &quot;Fall Out&quot; at one point. To fill in the gaps, Sting and Copeland dug up old songs they had written and used elements of them to create new songs. Much of the lyrics to &quot;Bring On the Night&quot; were recycled from Sting&#x27;s Last Exit song &quot;Carrion Prince (O Ye of Little Hope)&quot; and &quot;The Bed&#x27;s Too Big Without You&quot; similarly started as a Last Exit tune, while &quot;Does Everyone Stare&quot; originates from a piano piece Copeland wrote in college. The closing track &quot;No Time This Time&quot; was previously the B-side to &quot;So Lonely&quot; in November 1978, and was added to pad out the album&#x27;s running time.

==Music and lyrics==
As on the band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Reggatta de Blanc&quot; features the Police&#x27;s original fusion of hard rock, British pop, reggae, and new wave music. The instrumental &quot;Reggatta de Blanc&quot;, one of the few songs written by the Police as a group, was developed from an extended instrumental piece that the band would typically work into their live performances of &quot;Can&#x27;t Stand Losing You&quot;. &quot;Bring On the Night&quot; was written three years earlier as &quot;Carrion Prince&quot;, the title taken from Ted Hughes&#x27;s poem &quot;King of Carrion&quot;, and is about Pontius Pilate; however, after reading &quot;The Executioner&#x27;s Song&quot;, Sting felt that the words fitted Gary Gilmore&#x27;s death wish, and says that since then, &quot;I sing it with him in mind.&quot; &quot;The Bed&#x27;s Too Big Without You&quot; was covered by reggae singer Sheila Hylton in 1981, and became a UK Top 40 hit.

==Reception and legacy==
&quot;Reggatta de Blanc&quot; continued to build on the success of &quot;Outlandos d&#x27;Amour&quot;, hitting number one on the British, Australian, and Dutch album charts upon its release in October 1979. &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; and &quot;Walking on the Moon&quot; were released as singles and both reached number one in the UK, the band&#x27;s first singles to do so. According to rock journalist Tim Peacock, with its success, the album transformed the Police &quot;into one of the post-punk era&#x27;s defining bands&quot;.

The album was met with positive reviews from magazines such as &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, &quot;People&quot;, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. Writing for the latter in December 1979, Debra Rae Cohen said that objections to the band&#x27;s stylistic appropriations of new wave and reggae are &quot;rendered moot by the sheer energy of the band&#x27;s rhythmic counter-punching&quot;. In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s year-end Pazz &amp; Jop poll of American critics nationwide, &quot;Reggatta de Blanc&quot; was voted the 35th best album of 1979. Robert Christgau, the poll&#x27;s creator and the &quot;Voice&quot;″s chief critic, was lukewarm about the album in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981): &quot;The idea is to fuse Sting&#x27;s ringing rock voice and the trio&#x27;s aggressive, hard-edged rock attack with a less eccentric version of reggae&#x27;s groove and a saner version of reggae&#x27;s mix. To me the result sounds half-assed. And though I suppose I might find the &#x27;synthesis&#x27; innovative if I heard as much reggae as they do in England, it&#x27;s more likely I&#x27;d find it infuriating.&quot; In 1981, the album&#x27;s title track earned the band a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Greg Prato said that the band&#x27;s intense touring schedule leading up to the album had made their unique reggae rock fusion sharper, leading to a work that was &quot;much more polished production-wise and fully developed from a songwriting standpoint&quot;, but also &quot;more sedate&quot; than their first album.

&quot;Reggatta de Blanc&quot; has appeared on professional listings of the greatest albums. In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the record at number 369 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time; on an updated version of the list published in 2012, it placed at number 372. In 2006, it was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2014, &quot;Spin&quot; cited it as one of the major moments in the history of white reggae. In an interview with &quot;Modern Drummer&quot;, Stewart Copeland named it his favourite Police album.

<text>Zenyatta Mondatta (stylised as Zenyattà Mondatta on the album cover artwork) is the third studio album by British rock band the Police, released on 3 October 1980 by A&amp;M Records. It was co-produced by the band and Nigel Gray.

&quot;Zenyatta Mondatta&quot; reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and number five on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It produced the hit singles &quot;Don&#x27;t Stand So Close to Me&quot; and &quot;De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da&quot;. The album won the band two Grammy Awards: Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal for &quot;Don&#x27;t Stand So Close to Me&quot; and Best Rock Instrumental Performance for &quot;Behind My Camel&quot;.

==Recording==
&quot;Zenyatta Mondatta&quot; was written during the Police&#x27;s second tour and recorded in four weeks (minus two days for concerts in Ireland and at the Milton Keynes festival in the United Kingdom). The band members have often expressed disappointment over the album, going so far as to re-record two songs during a brief, unsuccessful reunion in 1986. Drummer Stewart Copeland said about the time pressures: &quot;We had bitten off more than we could chew. ... we finished the album at 4 a.m. on the day we were starting our next world tour. We went to bed for a few hours and then traveled down to Belgium for the first gig. It was cutting it very fine.&quot;

The band had wanted to record the album at Surrey Sound, the recording site of their first two albums, but could not record at any British studio for tax reasons. They were, however, able to retain Nigel Gray as their co-producer, bringing him with them to Wisseloord Studios in the Netherlands. Feeling that he had played a significant part in the Police&#x27;s first two albums, Gray negotiated for a £25,000 (£ in ) fee, which brought the album&#x27;s total budget to £35,000 (more than twice the combined budgets of their first two albums, but still exceptionally cheap for a band who at that point had become established stars).

As mentioned by Copeland, the Police embarked on a tour of the world the day of the album&#x27;s completion, beginning in Belgium and finishing in Australia.

==Composition==
The album is the last of the Police&#x27;s early era, influenced by reggae and punk and featuring few musical elements on top of the core guitar, bass, and drums.

The record has two instrumentals, &quot;The Other Way of Stopping&quot; (named from a line in Bob Newhart&#x27;s &quot;The Driving Instructor&quot; routine) and &quot;Behind My Camel&quot;. &quot;Behind My Camel&quot; was guitarist Andy Summers&#x27; first entirely self-penned composition. As bassist and vocalist Sting refused to play on it, Summers recorded the bass line himself, overdubbing the guitar parts. According to Sting, &quot;I hated that song so much that, one day when I was in the studio, I found the tape lying on the table. So I took it around the back of the studio and actually buried it in the garden.&quot; Nigel Gray believed that the title was an in-joke by Summers: &quot;He didn&#x27;t tell me this himself but I&#x27;m 98% sure the reason is this: what would you find behind a camel? A monumental pile of shit.&quot;

&quot;Bombs Away&quot; was written and demoed using a Siouxsie and the Banshees tape. Copeland said that &quot;when he first set up his home studio he got hold of a load of second hand tape which included some stuff by Siouxsie and the Banshees. &#x27;Bombs Away&#x27; was written on a Siouxsie and the Banshees backing track. I changed the speed and did things to the EQ to change the drum pattern. So with the desk I can get my song playing, then press a switch and there&#x27;s Siouxsie singing away.&quot;

&quot;Zenyatta Mondatta&quot; also saw the band&#x27;s lyrics turning towards political events, with Sting&#x27;s &quot;Driven to Tears&quot; commenting on poverty and Copeland&#x27;s &quot;Bombs Away&quot; referring to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. These themes became more prevalent on the Police&#x27;s next album, &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot;.

==Title==
Stewart Copeland said that the group arrived at the album&#x27;s title after deciding it should roll off the tongue. &quot;Zenyatta&quot; and &quot;Mondatta&quot; are invented words, hinting at Zen, at Jomo Kenyatta, at the French for &#x27;the world&#x27; (), and at &quot;reggatta&quot;, from the title of the previous Police album, &quot;Reggatta de Blanc&quot;. As Copeland explained:

Jerry Moss, co-founder of A&amp;M Records, named the champion racehorse Zenyatta (born 2004) after the album. Blizzard Entertainment also named a character Zenyatta (and his brother, non-playable character – Mondatta) in the video game &quot;Overwatch&quot;. Additionally, in the English translation of the manga &quot;Stardust Crusaders&quot; published by VIZ Media, the characters Oingo and Boingo are renamed Zenyatta and Mondatta due to copyright laws.

==Release==
&quot;Zenyatta Mondatta&quot; debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and stayed atop the chart for four weeks. The album also charted at number one in Australia. In the United States, it spent almost three years on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and peaked at number five. The album produced two singles, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stand So Close to Me&quot; and &quot;De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da&quot;. On the UK Singles Chart, the former became the band&#x27;s third number one, while the latter reached number five. The two singles also became the band&#x27;s first top ten hits on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, with both peaking at number ten on the chart.

A&amp;M Records first remastered the album for release in compact disc format in the US in 1990. Frank DeLuna and Marv Bornstein mastered the original 1980 vinyl LP, but it is unclear if they also remastered the CD.

Sting would later perform his own version of &quot;Shadows in the Rain&quot; on his 1985 debut solo album &quot;The Dream of the Blue Turtles&quot;. In 1986, the Police re-recorded &quot;Don&#x27;t Stand So Close to Me&quot; and &quot;De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da&quot;. The former was released on &quot;Every Breath You Take: The Singles&quot;, while the latter was released on the DTS version of &quot;Every Breath You Take: The Classics&quot;. &quot;When the World Is Running Down, You Make the Best of What&#x27;s Still Around&quot; was remixed by the production duo Different Gear and released as a single in 2000, credited to &quot;Different Gear vs. The Police&quot;. It reached number 28 on the UK Singles Chart.

==Critical reception==
In a 1980 review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, David Fricke praised &quot;Zenyatta Mondatta&quot; as &quot;near-perfect pop by a band that bends all the rules and sometimes makes musical mountains out of molehill-size ideas&quot;, complimenting the band&#x27;s &quot;elastic&quot; interplay. Phil Sutcliffe of &quot;Sounds&quot; wrote that he initially viewed the album as inferior to the band&#x27;s earlier material, but came to recognise its strength, despite still finding it somewhat unadventurous: &quot;By word and note it&#x27;s as articulate and literate as you might hope. It avoids a whole catalogue of megastar pitfalls. &quot;Zenyatta&quot; is not pretentious, not bombastic, not lazy.&quot; In &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, David Hepworth opined that Sting had particularly improved as a vocalist and songwriter, describing his compositions as &quot;tougher, more concerned, but no less melodic.&quot;

&quot;Zenyatta Mondatta&quot; was voted the 28th best album of 1980 in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s year-end Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll. At the Grammy Awards in 1982, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stand So Close to Me&quot; won for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, while &quot;Behind My Camel&quot; won for Best Rock Instrumental Performance, marking the Police&#x27;s second consecutive win in the latter category.

Retrospectively, AllMusic critic Greg Prato cited &quot;Zenyatta Mondatta&quot; as &quot;arguably the best Police album&quot; and &quot;one of the finest rock albums of all time.&quot; In 2004&#x27;s &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, J. D. Considine highlighted the more pronounced groove of the music: &quot;The emphasis on rhythmic intensity made the songs catchier (as &#x27;Voices Inside My Head&#x27; shows, the band certainly knew how to work a vamp), and the rhythmic dynamics add a singular punch to the material.&quot;

<doc id="231900" wikidata="Q751468" url="?curid=231900" title="Ghost in the Machine (album)">
<text>Ghost in the Machine is the fourth studio album by English rock band the Police. The album was released on 2 October 1981 by A&amp;M Records. The songs were recorded between January and September 1981 during sessions that took place at AIR Studios in Montserrat and Le Studio in Quebec, assisted by record producer Hugh Padgham.

&quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot; topped the UK Albums Chart and peaked at number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album produced the highly successful singles &quot;Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic&quot;, &quot;Invisible Sun&quot;, and &quot;Spirits in the Material World&quot;, with a fourth single, &quot;Secret Journey&quot;, also being released in the US. &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot; was listed at number 322 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The album was reissued in 1983 on CD.

==Production and recording==
After having produced the previous album &quot;Zenyatta Mondatta&quot; within a tight deadline of four weeks under pressure from the record company to deliver an album to the market, the Police had decided to loosen up more for a change when it came around to recording &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot;. This time, they spent six weeks recording at AIR Studios in Montserrat, which was, according to drummer Stewart Copeland, &quot;a 12 hour flight from the nearest record company&quot;.

This album marked a change in engineer/co-producer, from Nigel Gray—who did the band&#x27;s albums up to that point—to Hugh Padgham, best known for the drum sound he achieved on records by Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins. In fact, for this album, Padgham initiated a technique in which the band were recording together in separate rooms of the AIR Studios facility: Andy Summers in the main studio with all his guitars and amplifiers, Sting in the control room with his bass directly plugged into the desk and Copeland in the dining room with his drums to get a &quot;live&quot; feel. This method would be repeated for the next album.

&quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot; was the first Police album to feature heavy use of keyboards and saxophone. Besides keyboards, the twenty minute section comprising “Hungry for You (J&#x27;aurais toujours faim de toi)&quot; through &quot;One World (Not Three)&quot; includes many saxophone harmonies, while the opening to &quot;Secret Journey&quot; showcases the Roland GR-300 Guitar Synthesizer.

The band&#x27;s frontman, Sting, brought in Jean Roussel to record the piano parts on the demo of &quot;Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic&quot;. However, the group could not better it with the equipment available at AIR Studios; they ended up using the demo as the backing track for the official recording, with drummer Stewart Copeland and guitarist Andy Summers dubbing their parts on. Sting also played all the saxophone parts on the album. Summers recollected:

The album opens with &quot;Spirits in the Material World&quot;, featuring keyboards dubbed over Summers&#x27; reggae-inspired guitar licks. &quot;Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic&quot; features piano, a Caribbean vibe, and an extended non-verbal vocal solo at the end. &quot;Invisible Sun&quot; is a mixture of slow, steady verses, a bombastic chorus, and several guitar solos. &quot;Hungry for You (J&#x27;aurais toujours faim de toi)&quot; is sung mostly in French, with the bass and saxophones both repeating a single 8-note melody for the length of the song, while the guitar maintains a steady beat. &quot;Demolition Man&quot;, the band&#x27;s longest song—almost six minutes in length—features a prominent bass line and saxophone, and was written by Sting while staying at Peter O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s Irish mansion. The song was originally given to Jamaican singer Grace Jones, who released her rendition on &quot;Nightclubbing&quot; earlier in 1981; the Police then recorded a hard rock version for &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot; due to their dissatisfaction with Jones&#x27; performance. A solo recording by Sting became a belated hit in 1993 as the theme song for the action film of the same title, starring Sandra Bullock, Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes. Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band also recorded a version—rearranged and with extensive use of synthesizers—in 1982 for their &quot;Somewhere in Afrika&quot; album.

&quot;Too Much Information&quot;, &quot;Rehumanize Yourself&quot;, and &quot;One World (Not Three)&quot; are centered around multiple saxophone riffs. As with &quot;Landlord&quot; and &quot;Dead End Job&quot;, Copeland had written both music and lyrics for &quot;Rehumanize Yourself&quot;, but Sting rejected the lyrics and replaced them with those he composed himself. The final three songs, &quot;Omegaman&quot;, &quot;Secret Journey&quot;, and &quot;Darkness&quot;, return to the darker sound which opens the album.

==Artwork and titling==
Much of the material on the album was inspired by Arthur Koestler&#x27;s &quot;The Ghost in the Machine&quot;, which also provided the title. It was the first Police album to bear an English-language title. In his younger days Sting was an avid reader of Koestler. Koestler said he was &quot;slightly tickled&quot; by the homage. In the 2012 &quot;Can&#x27;t Stand Losing You: Surviving the Police&quot; documentary, Summers commented that the title felt fitting as he was going through a divorce at the time and the band was not getting along during production. The subsequent Police album &quot;Synchronicity&quot; was inspired by Koestler&#x27;s &quot;The Roots of Coincidence&quot;, which mentions Carl Jung&#x27;s theory of synchronicity. 

The cover art for &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot; features a sixteen-segment display-inspired graphic that depicts the heads of the three band members, each with a distinctive hairstyle. The album&#x27;s cover is ranked at number 45 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;50 Greatest Album Covers&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot; debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and spent three weeks atop the chart. In the United States, it reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

&quot;Omegaman&quot; was chosen by A&amp;M Records to be the first single from the album, but according to Andy Summers, Sting refused to allow its release in single form. &quot;Invisible Sun&quot; was ultimately released as the album&#x27;s first single in the UK and was a success, reaching number two on the UK Singles Chart, even though its music video was banned by the BBC for including footage of the conflict in Northern Ireland. 

&quot;Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second overall single, and as the first single in most other territories, becoming the band&#x27;s fourth UK number one and peaking at number three on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Spirits in the Material World&quot; followed, peaking at number 12 in the UK and number 11 in the US. &quot;Secret Journey&quot; was released as a single in the US, where it charted at number 46.

==Critical reception==
The reception for &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot; was mostly positive. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Debra Rae Cohen found that the Police &quot;display more commitment, more real anger, on &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot; than ever before.&quot; In &quot;Record Mirror&quot;, Robin Smith praised the album as &quot;the best thing they&#x27;ve ever done&quot;, noting its &quot;overall sense of dedication and quality&quot; and more varied range of musical styles. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; remarked: &quot;It&#x27;s pointless to deny that they make the chops work for the common good—both their trickiness and their simplicity provide consistent pleasure here.&quot; &quot;Smash Hits&quot; critic Mark Ellen was less receptive, deeming it a &quot;patchy&quot; album with both &quot;dazzling singles&quot; and filler tracks reminiscent of the band&#x27;s earlier material. &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot; was voted the 24th best album of 1981 in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll.

In a retrospective review of &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot;, Greg Prato of AllMusic observed that the Police &quot;had streamlined their sound to focus more on their pop side and less on their trademark reggae-rock.&quot; He found that the album was &quot;not a pop masterpiece&quot;, but &quot;did serve as an important stepping stone between their more direct early work and their more ambitious latter direction.&quot; J. D. Considine, writing in 2004&#x27;s &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, stated that &quot;well-modulated&quot; compositions such as &quot;Spirits in the Material World&quot; and &quot;Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic&quot; reflected the band&#x27;s continued experimentation with more dynamic rhythms.

In 2000, &quot;Q&quot; placed &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot; at number 76 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest British Albums Ever&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot; at number 86 on its 2002 list of the 100 best albums of the 1980s. It was ranked at number 322 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and at number 323 in a 2012 update of the list. &quot;The Guardian&quot; featured the record in its 2007 list of &quot;1000 Albums to Hear Before You Die&quot;.

Writing in 2021 for a &quot;Best Albums of 1981&quot; list, &quot;Paste&quot; magazine contributor Saby Reyes-Kulkarni observed that &quot;There are albums that envelope you in an ambience so unlike anything else you’ve ever heard that listening to them is like taking a trip to another world,&quot; further describing &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot; as &quot;the most sonically unified work of [The Police&#x27;s] career, a seamless and revolutionary integration of reggae into [the band&#x27;s style] that, like Talking Heads and Peter Gabriel, established a futurist vision of pop that could absorb sounds from all over the world—in some ways, pop music has operated from the same premise ever since.&quot;

==Alternate sequence release==
In 2022, the band released a reissue of the album containing a different track order, and three additional tracks not included on the original album: &quot;I Burn for You&quot;, &quot;Once Upon a Daydream&quot;, and &quot;Shambelle&quot;. &quot;I Burn for You&quot; was originally released on the soundtrack album for the film &quot;Brimstone and Treacle&quot;, whereas the other two songs were originally B-sides to singles from the album. All 3 additional tracks had been previously released on &quot;Message in a Box: The Complete Recordings&quot;.

<doc id="231908" wikidata="Q1188848" url="?curid=231908" title="The Cars (album)">
<text>The Cars is the debut studio album by American rock band the Cars, released on June 6, 1978, by Elektra Records. The album was produced by longtime collaborator Roy Thomas Baker, and spawned several hit singles, including &quot;Just What I Needed&quot;, &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Girl&quot;, and &quot;Good Times Roll&quot;, as well as other radio and film hits such as &quot;Bye Bye Love&quot; and &quot;Moving in Stereo&quot;. &quot;The Cars&quot; peaked at number 18 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, and has been certified 6× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

==Background==
Formed in Boston in 1976, the Cars consisted of Ric Ocasek, Benjamin Orr, Elliot Easton, David Robinson, and Greg Hawkes, all of whom had been in and out of multiple bands throughout the 1970s. After becoming a club staple, the band recorded a number of demos in early 1977. Some of these songs later appeared in completed form on &quot;The Cars&quot;, such as &quot;Just What I Needed&quot; and &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Girl&quot;, while others were saved for a later release, such as &quot;Leave or Stay&quot; and &quot;Ta Ta Wayo Wayo&quot; (both of which later saw release on their 1987 album &quot;Door to Door&quot;). The demos for &quot;Just What I Needed&quot; and &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Girl&quot; were often played on Boston radio by DJ Maxanne Sartori, giving the band frequent airplay.

Both Arista and Elektra attempted to sign the band, but in the end, Elektra was chosen, due to its lack of new wave acts, allowing the band to stand out more than they would have had they signed with the new wave-heavy Arista. Robinson said of the choice, &quot;Here they had the Eagles and Jackson Browne, and along comes this crazy Boston band who wanted a black-and-white photo collage on their cover.&quot;

==Music and lyrics==
Musically, &quot;The Cars&quot; has been described as new wave, power pop, and synth-rock. It featured a large amount of contemporary technology on many of its tracks, due to the band&#x27;s appreciation for new equipment. Robinson said, &quot;We&#x27;d always get the latest stuff from music stores even if it would be obsolete in two months. It reached the point where I&#x27;d have 10 or 12 foot switches to hit during a short set.&quot; The album&#x27;s lyrics are notable for frontman Ocasek&#x27;s use of irony and sarcasm. Keyboardist Hawkes said, &quot;There was definitely a little self-conscious irony in there. We started out wanting to be electric and straight-ahead rock, and it kind of turned into an artier kind of thing.&quot;

==Artwork==
The woman featured on the album&#x27;s front cover was Nataliya Medvedeva, a Russian-born model, singer, writer, and journalist.

Unlike many of the Cars&#x27; album covers, the cover for &quot;The Cars&quot; was designed by the record company, rather than drummer Robinson. Robinson said in an interview that he &quot;had designed a very different album cover [for &quot;The Cars&quot;] that cost $80.00 to design.&quot; He continued, &quot;I remember the price exactly. It was completely finished and everything, but it was a little more bizarre than the cover that they had in mind, so they changed some of it because of copyright problems and put it in as the inner sleeve. But I think that was way more how we envisioned who we were then.&quot; The cover was not well liked by the members of the band, however. Robinson said, &quot;I thought that when the Elektra came out it was way too slick. The pictures of us I didn&#x27;t like.&quot; Guitarist Elliot Easton expressed dislike for &quot;that big grinning face&quot;, saying, &quot;Man, I got tired of that cover.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;The Cars&quot; peaked at number 18 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in March 1979, spending 139 weeks on the chart. The record was also ranked number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 year-chart for 1979.

Three singles were released from the album: &quot;Just What I Needed&quot; (number 27 in the US, number 17 in the UK), &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Girl&quot; (number 35 in the US, number three in the UK), and &quot;Good Times Roll&quot; (number 41 in the US), all of which enjoyed heavy airplay on AOR radio stations. Aside from the singles, album tracks &quot;You&#x27;re All I&#x27;ve Got Tonight&quot;, &quot;Bye Bye Love&quot;, and &quot;Moving in Stereo&quot; all became radio favorites.

==Reception and legacy==
&quot;The Cars&quot; was well received by music critics. &quot;The pop songs are wonderful&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Kit Rachlis stated in his 1978 review, adding: &quot;Easy and eccentric at the same time, all are potential hits.&quot; He found that &quot;the album comes apart only when it becomes arty and falls prey to producer Roy Thomas Baker&#x27;s lacquered sound and the group&#x27;s own penchant for electronic effects.&quot;

Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; wrote, &quot;Ric Ocasek writes catchy, hardheaded-to-coldhearted songs eased by wryly rhapsodic touches, the playing is tight and tough, and it all sounds wonderful on the radio. But though on a cut-by-cut basis Roy Thomas Baker&#x27;s production adds as much as it distracts, here&#x27;s hoping the records get rawer.&quot;

In a retrospective review, AllMusic&#x27;s Greg Prato praised &quot;The Cars&quot; as &quot;a genuine rock masterpiece&quot; and stated that &quot;all nine tracks are new wave/rock classics&quot;, concluding: &quot;With flawless performances, songwriting, and production, the Cars&#x27; debut remains one of rock&#x27;s all-time classics.&quot;

Elliot Easton said of the album, &quot;We used to joke that the first album should be called &quot;The Cars&#x27; Greatest Hits&quot;. We knew that a lot of great bands fall through the cracks. But we were getting enough feedback from people we respected to know that we were on the right track.&quot;

===Retrospective rankings===
In 2000, it was voted number 384 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;The Cars&quot; at number 282 on its 2003 list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, with the ranking slipping to number 284 in the 2012 update of the list, and to number 353 in the 2020 update.

===Accolades===
It was inducted into the National Recording Registry on April 16, 2024, for being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;.

<text>John Robbins (born October 26, 1947) is an American author, who popularized the links among nutrition, environmentalism, and animal rights. He is the author of the 1987 &quot;Diet for a New America&quot;, an exposé on connections between diet, physical health, animal cruelty, and environmentalism. Robbins founded the organization EarthSave in 1988.

==Biography==
Robbins is the son of Irma Robbins and Irv Robbins, co-founder of Baskin-Robbins. He is of Jewish descent. John graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1969, and received a master&#x27;s degree from Antioch College, in 1976. Rather than following the ice-cream parlor legacy of his father, he left the company to seek a simpler life. He and his wife Deo were married on March 10, 1967. Ocean Robbins, their son, is the founder of Food Revolution Network.

In 1987 &quot;Diet for a New America&quot; was published. In the book Robbins links the impacts of factory farming on human health, the environment, and animal welfare, to make a case for a plant-based diet. A year later he founded EarthSave (see below).

In 2001, Robbins updated and reiterated his views on veganism for ethical, environmental and health reasons in the book &quot;The Food Revolution&quot;. The book includes information on organic food, genetically modified food, and factory farming.

He worked with PETA in 2002 to sue the California Milk Advisory Board over its &#x27;happy cows&#x27; television advertisement. The Milk Advisory Board won on a technicality.

His 2006 book &quot;Healthy at 100&quot;, published by Random House, was printed on 100% post-consumer non-chlorine bleached paper, a first for a book from a major U.S. publisher.

Robbins is also on the advisory board of &quot;Naked Food Magazine&quot;, for which he is also a regular contributor of articles espousing a plant-based diet.

==EarthSave==
In 1988, Robbins founded EarthSave, an international, non-profit organization. The organization was born to channel the reader response to his &quot;Diet for a New America&quot;. EarthSave did outreach to the non-vegetarian public, with information tables and vegetarian social activities such as vegetarian Thanksgiving potlucks, and activism on vegetarian, animal, and food system issues.

EarthSave sponsored a youth-outreach group, YES (Youth for Environmental Sanity), which toured the country visiting high schools and raising awareness of the EarthSave message.

EarthSave continues to promote healthy, environmentally sound food choices. As of January 2022, its head office is in Chatsworth, California.

Earthsave Canada was established as a registered non-profit charity in British Columbia in March 1990.

<text>The General Certificate of Education (GCE) is a subject-specific family of academic qualifications used in awarding bodies in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, Crown dependencies and a few Commonwealth countries. For some time, the Scottish education system has been different from those in the other countries of the United Kingdom.

The GCE is composed of three levels; they are, in increasing order of difficulty: 
* the Ordinary Level (&quot;O Level&quot;);
* the Advanced Subsidiary Level (&quot;A1 Level&quot; or &quot;AS Level&quot;), higher than the O Level, serving as a level in its own right, and functioning as a precursor to the full Advanced Level; and
* Advanced Level (&quot;A Level&quot;).

The General Certificate of Education Advanced Level (GCE &quot;A Levels&quot;) is an entry qualification for universities in the United Kingdom and many other locations worldwide.

==United Kingdom==
===England and Wales===

The General Certificate of Education set out to provide a national standard for matriculation to university undergraduate courses. It had two levels, Ordinary and Advanced, which rapidly became known throughout the education system as &quot;O levels&quot; and &quot;A Levels.&quot; Ordinary levels were usually taken at the age of 16, and Advanced levels at the age of 18 after a further two-year course. Both the O level and A level courses were examined by subject, and matriculation (the minimum standard for university entrance) was set at five passes in different subjects, of which two had to be at A level.

For matriculation purposes the highest grade pass of a subject taken at CSE level was considered a pass at O level.

In the English education system both the O level and CSE examinations were replaced in 1988 with the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE), which set out to provide a multi-level examination system catering for all abilities of secondary school pupils.

====Examination Boards (England)====

Though the GCE was considered a national standard, there was no national syllabus, and it was run by a number of different Examination Boards, each of which set their own syllabi and papers. These included the Northern Universities Joint Matriculation Board (&quot;Northern&quot;), the University of London (&quot;The London Board&quot;) and the Oxford and Cambridge Board.

Examination sessions were held bi-annually in May and November and successful candidates received a certificate listing the subjects they had passed in the session, together with the marks achieved in each. In the earliest years of the system subject marks were given as percentages at both Ordinary and Advanced Level. In later years ordinary level pass marks were graded 1–6, with 1 being the highest. The grading system was further simplified in 1975 when the six pass marks were reduced to three, graded A, B, C. In normalised terms at O level the lower bound for A was then 70% and the lower bound for C 45%. For matriculation purposes C was the lowest pass grade. D, E and F grades were also shown for the first time—indicating that a paper had been sat but the student had not achieved a pass mark.

In the late 1970s, A level certificates showed grades from A to F. At A level E was considered a pass for matriculation, and corresponded to 30%. All these examinations were closed book, and Art was the only subject for which any assignment outside the examination hall contributed to the final mark.

====Today====
Though the O level was replaced in the English education system in the 1980s, some examination boards continue to offer Ordinary level examinations to English Language schools overseas. This enables these students to obtain matriculation instantly recognisable to British universities.

Significant numbers of private schools in England have also reverted to preparing pupils for GCE examinations.

Letter grades are used, with A, B, C, D, and E representing a pass and U (unclassified) representing a fail. After leading British universities had expressed concerns that the A grade alone would no longer be enough to distinguish the most exceptional candidates, the A* grade was introduced (GCSE, the replacement of GCE and CSE) for students who achieve 80% and above in the overall A-Level qualification and achieve 90% and over in all A2 (this applies to GCSE and not GCE but may apply to CSE) modules.

A new 9-1 grading system in GCSEs was phased in from 2017 (the replacement of A*-U, with U being retained). Grade 9 is situated above the former A*, which is a Grade 8.

====Former qualifications====
An additional GCE qualification, the Alternative Ordinary Level (AO Level), was formerly available in most subject areas. Sometimes incorrectly known as the Advanced Ordinary Level, the AO Level syllabus and examination both assumed a higher degree of maturity on the part of candidates, and employed teaching methods more commonly associated with A Level study. The AO Level was discontinued, with final admissions in 1987 and final qualifications awarded in 1988.

In the past, a Scholarship / Special / &quot;S-Level&quot; / Advanced Extension Award (AEA) existed. An Advanced Supplementary Level qualification was also formerly available (designated &quot;AS Level&quot; but not to be confused with the modern-day AS Level, which is lower than the A Level).

===Scotland===

GCE Ordinary and Advanced levels did not exist within the Scottish Education system, but have an equivalent, administered by the Scottish Qualification Authority (the SQA). GCSEs are the equivalent to a Scottish National level 5 (Nat5), A Levels are the equivalent to an SQA Highers.

Both more advanced and less advanced examinations are offered by the SQA, National level 3, National level 4 (equivalent to a Btec) National level 5 (equivalent to GCSE), Higher (equivalent to A Levels) and Advanced higher.

===Northern Ireland===

The secondary education system in Northern Ireland continues to use the GCE Ordinary and Advanced level system. It also retains selection to grammar school by the AQE examination, a public examination which selects children as suitable for an academic (essentially a liberal arts) secondary syllabus from the age of eleven to eighteen.

==Worldwide use==

===Brunei===
Up to now, most schools in Brunei are under GCE, the levels are of O-level, A-level, and AS-level Examinations are conducted by the Examinations Department of Brunei Darussalam.

===Cameroon===
In Cameroon, the GCE Ordinary Level examination is a 3-year course program starting from Form 3 to Form 5 (Years 9 to 11). It is usually written in Form 5 (Year 11) in secondary schools, meanwhile the GCE Advanced Level examinations are written in Upper 6 (Year 13) in high school. Most secondary schools in Cameroon which do the English form of education and write both the GCE A-Level and O-Level examinations were boarding schools, but since then many day schools were opened which offered a complete GCE course, and anyone wishing to have an English education is no longer obliged to attend a boarding school. The GCE saw changes in syllabus content at the ordinary and advanced levels in some science subjects in order to adapt to the world&#x27;s advancing school program.

During Easter break around March, students in these boarding schools stay for GCE courses for a week and a few days in school for extra classes in order to cover up their syllabus. 
At the end of the school year, all other students leave, while GCE candidates stay on to revise and prepare for the exams in late May. Once the candidates finish writing in early June, they all return to their various homes, waiting to hear their results. The same thing applies for GCE candidates in day schools. The results for the GCE O-Level and A-level exams in Cameroon are announced around 23 July.

===Hong Kong===
The two educational qualifications, Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination (HKCEE) and Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination (HKALE), were the two school-leaving exams until they were replaced by the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE). The HKDSE eventually replaced the two exams by only having one public exam in high school year 3 (year 12). English Schools Foundation (though some schools are also adopting the IB Diploma program).

=== Pakistan ===
Some of Pakistan&#x27;s top schools offers the GCE certification which are mostly private schools. The number of entries for GCE qualifications for O Levels and A Levels has been increasing in Pakistan. The entries for O Levels qualifications in Pakistan grew by 5% in 2015-16 from the previous year, and increased by 8% for A Levels. O Levels and A Levels are considered to be equivalent to the local board of intermediate and secondary education (BISE) education system in Pakistan.

===Singapore===
Students take the O-Levels after completing Secondary 4 at age 16 for the Special and Express streams, or Secondary 5 at age 17 for the Normal Academic Stream. After that, they have the option to go on to a junior college for two years in preparation for the A-Levels or study a vocational trade and earn a diploma at a polytechnic or technical school. Increasingly, students who perform well in school are given the option to bypass the O-levels and take the A-Levels, in a scheme dubbed the integrated programme (also known as the &quot;through-train&quot; programme).

===Sri Lanka===
In Sri Lanka GCE Ordinary Level and GCE Advanced Level examinations are conducted by the Department of Examinations of the Government of Sri Lanka. The GCE(O/L) is normally conducted in the month of December and GCE (A/L)s are conducted in the month of August. They are conducted on an island-wide examination centres on same time. Examination entrance is restricted by a minimal number of formal school going years and laboratory field work. The majority of candidates enter the exams via their respective schools, while candidates who have finished school education can also apply as a private candidate.

The O/L examination is regarded as the qualification examination for starting on GCE(A/L). Specialization streaming is depended on the grades obtained for subjects in the O/L. The country&#x27;s reputed schools admit students to their A/L, depending on the O/L grades.

The Sri Lankan University Grants commission determines the cut-off points for the selection of students to the Sri Lankan universities according to the grade points obtained in the A/L examinations based on the standard normal distribution.

Private Schools/International Schools in Sri Lanka offer British Ordinary Level and Advanced Level Qualifications that are recognized both locally and internationally. These institutions provide students with the option to pursue either Cambridge International (CIE) qualifications or Pearson Edexcel qualifications for O/L and A/L examinations.

== Former use ==

=== Malaysia ===
GCE examinations in Malaysia were used to be conducted by the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate, when two agencies of the Malaysian Ministry of Education took over the role with UCLES retaining an advisory role on standards.
In most schools today in Malaysia

==Comparison to U.S. high school diploma==

The US equivalent of the GCE for admissions would be, roughly, the high school diploma. However, in England and Wales, the high school diploma is considered to be at the level of the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE), which is awarded at Year 11. For college and university admissions, the high school diploma may be accepted in lieu of the GCSE if an average grade of C is obtained in subjects with a GCSE counterpart.

As the more academically rigorous A Levels awarded at Year 13 are expected for university admission, Students who wish to study in the United Kingdom may additionally participate in the Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) programs, which are considered to be at the level of the A Level qualifications and earn points on the UCAS Tariff, or may opt to take A Level examinations in British international schools or as private candidates. Standardized tests, such as the College Board&#x27;s SAT and SAT Subject Tests or the ACT, may also be considered.

The Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) recommends that in addition to a high school diploma, grades of 3 or above in at least two, or ideally three, Advanced Placement exams may be considered as meeting general entry requirements for admission. The IB Diploma may also be accepted. For College Board tests, a minimum score of 600 or higher in all sections of the SAT or a minimum score of 26 or higher in all sections of the ACT along with a minimum score of 600 in relevant SAT Subject Tests may be considered as meeting general entry requirements for admission.

<doc id="231917" wikidata="Q3873201" url="?curid=231917" title="National Vocational Qualification">
<text>National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) are practical work-based awards in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland that are achieved through training and assessment. The regulatory framework supporting NVQs was withdrawn in 2015 and replaced by the Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF), although the term &quot;NVQ&quot; may be used in RQF qualifications if they &quot;are based on recognised occupational standards, work-based and/or simulated work-based assessment, and where they confer occupational competence&quot;.

As the NVQ is based on a student&#x27;s practical skills, it is completed in the workplace. The NVQ was assessed by building up a portfolio of evidence based on the student&#x27;s professional experience. At the end of the NVQ, the student undergoes final practical assessments, during which an NVQ assessor will observe and ask questions. To achieve an NVQ, candidates have to prove that they have the ability (competence) to carry out their job to the required standard. NVQs are based upon meeting National Occupational Standards, which describe the &quot;competencies&quot; expected in any given job role.

NVQs are not graded &quot;pass&quot; or &quot;fail&quot;. Instead, an NVQ is graded either &quot;Competent&quot; (which is seen as passing the NVQ) or, if further work must be completed, &quot;Not Yet Competent&quot; (which is regarded as failing the NVQ). Typically, candidates work towards an NVQ that reflects their role in a paid or voluntary position. For example, someone working in an administrative office role may take an NVQ in Business and Administration. There are five levels of NVQ, ranging from Level 1, which focuses on basic work activities, to Level 5 for senior management.

Although NVQs such as NVQ Level 3 can be roughly translated as being at the same level as a GCE Advanced Level or BTEC Level 3 Extended Diploma, in terms of depth and vigor of study, the NVQ cannot be compared with other academic qualifications at the same level, i.e. GCE Advanced Levels and the BTEC Level 3 Extended Diploma (an A* at A-Level is equivalent to a D* at BTEC Level 3). For this reason, the NVQ Level 3 does not attract UCAS points and cannot be used for university admission.

In Scotland, the approximately equivalent qualification is the Scottish Vocational Qualification. They are the responsibility of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Apprenticeships and Skills in the Department for Education.

== Levels ==
NVQs are competence-based qualifications. The five levels of NVQ are defined as having the following competencies:
* Level 1 – Competence, which involves the application of knowledge and skills in the performance of a range of varied work activities most of which may be routine and predictable. 
* Level 2 – Competence, which involves the application of knowledge and skills in a significant range of varied work activities, performed in a variety of contexts. Some of the activities are complex or non-routine, and there is some individual responsibility or autonomy. Collaboration with others, perhaps through membership of a work group or team, may often be a requirement.
* Level 3 – Competence, which involves the application of knowledge and skills in a broad range of varied work activities performed in a wide variety of contexts and most of which are complex and non-routine. There is considerable responsibility and autonomy, and control or guidance of others is often required.
* Level 4 – Competence, which involves the application of knowledge and skills in a broad range of complex, technical, or professional work activities performed in a wide variety of contexts and with a substantial degree of personal responsibility and autonomy. Responsibility for the work of others and the allocation of resources is often present.
* Level 5 – Competence, which involves the application of skills and a significant range of fundamental principles and complex techniques across a wide and often unpredictable variety of contexts. Very substantial personal autonomy and often a significant responsibility for the work of others and for the allocation of substantial resources feature strongly, as do personal accountabilities for analysis and diagnosis, design, planning, execution and evaluation.

== Approximate academic equivalents ==

=== Equivalents published by the UK government ===
Gov.uk lists the equivalents for academic qualifications between the Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF) and the framework for Higher Education Qualifications (FHEQ).

=== Research by the London School of Economics ===
NVQs are not formally defined in terms of equivalence to conventional academic qualifications. However, for the compilation of social statistics and other purposes, approximate equivalences have to be established. The following equivalences are used by the London School of Economics&#x27;s Research Lab
* NVQ 1 = foundation GNVQ, three to four GCSEs at grades D-E, Business &amp; Technology Education Council (BTEC) first certificate.
* NVQ 2 = four or five GCSEs at grades A*–C, BTEC first diploma.
* NVQ 3 = two or more A levels, BTEC Ordinary National Diploma (OND), City &amp; Guilds Advanced Craft.
* NVQ 4 = BTEC Higher National Certificate (HNC) or Higher National Diploma (HND), or City &amp; Guilds Full Technological Certificate / Diploma
* NVQ 5 = NQF 7–8

=== City and Guilds ===

Licentiateship (post nominal: LCGI) sits on level 4 of the National Qualifications Framework, and is therefore comparable to lower NVQ level 4. Both Graduateship (GCGI) and Associateship (ACGI) are at level six of the National Qualifications Framework, compared by OFQUAL to the highest category NVQs of level 4. Membership (MCGI) is placed on NQF level 7, and Fellowship (FCGI) on level 8, compared by OFQUAL to NVQs of level 5. City &amp; Guilds itself ties each NVQ to the level on the NQF with the same number.

Both Graduateship (GCGI) and Associateship (ACGI) have been awarded, before the year 2004, at level 5 of NVQ.

== NVQ Subjects ==

* Building and construction, and warehousing and distribution
* Engineering, manufacturing, and transportation operations and maintenance
* Science, horticulture, animal care and veterinary science
* Sport, leisure and recreation, and travel and tourism
* Hospitality and catering and service enterprises
* Language, literature and culture
* Health and social care, public services and child development
* Marketing, sales, administration and business management
* Crafts, creative arts and design, and media and communication
* Direct training and support
* Working within the hair and beauty industry

== Classifications ==

The NVQ Framework classifies the economy into the following areas:
* Tending animals, plants and land
* Extracting and providing natural resources
* Constructing
* Engineering
* Manufacturing
* Transporting
* Providing goods and services
* Providing health, social and protective services
* Providing business services
* Communicating and information technology
* Developing and extending knowledge and skill

<doc id="231919" wikidata="Q2713415" url="?curid=231919" title="Mary Star of the Sea (album)">
<text>Mary Star of the Sea is the only studio album by American alternative rock band Zwan, released on January 28, 2003 on Reprise. Produced by frontman Billy Corgan and Bjorn Thorsrud, the album was supported by the singles &quot;Honestly&quot; and &quot;Lyric&quot;.

The album debuted at number 3 in the US, selling 90,000 copies in its first week, and over 250,000 copies by the time of the band&#x27;s break-up later that year. Described by Corgan as &quot;the great lost Pumpkins record&quot;, the album&#x27;s music was spearheaded by Corgan and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin.

The album is named both for the Blessed Virgin Mary, from whom bandleader Corgan claimed to find comfort and guidance, and for the Catholic Church in Key West, Florida where he spent time during Zwan&#x27;s early rehearsals. Seven months after the album&#x27;s release Corgan announced the band&#x27;s dissolution, which he attributed to conflicts between the band&#x27;s members.

==Critical reception==
The album received mostly positive reviews. David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named &quot;Mary Star of the Sea&quot; the sixth best album of 2003. The &quot;Alternative Press&quot; called the album a &quot;return to form&quot; for Corgan. The album debuted at number 3 in the US, selling 90,000 copies in its first week, but quickly descended the charts, and fell short of the sales of any Smashing Pumpkins album. It went on to sell 250,000 copies by the time of the band&#x27;s breakup.

<doc id="231920" wikidata="Q1123036" url="?curid=231920" title="Scheduling (computing)">
<text>In computing, scheduling is the action of assigning resources to perform tasks. The resources may be processors, network links or expansion cards. The tasks may be threads, processes or data flows.

The scheduling activity is carried out by a mechanism called a scheduler. Schedulers are often designed so as to keep all computer resources busy (as in load balancing), allow multiple users to share system resources effectively, or to achieve a target quality-of-service.

Scheduling is fundamental to computation itself, and an intrinsic part of the execution model of a computer system; the concept of scheduling makes it possible to have computer multitasking with a single central processing unit (CPU).

==Goals==
A scheduler may aim at one or more goals, for example:

* maximizing &quot;throughput&quot; (the total amount of work completed per time unit); 
* minimizing &quot;wait time&quot; (time from work becoming ready until the first point it begins execution); 
* minimizing &quot;latency&quot; or &quot;response time&quot; (time from work becoming ready until it is finished in case of batch activity, or until the system responds and hands the first output to the user in case of interactive activity);
* maximizing &quot;fairness&quot; (equal CPU time to each process, or more generally appropriate times according to the priority and workload of each process).

In practice, these goals often conflict (e.g. throughput versus latency), thus a scheduler will implement a suitable compromise. Preference is measured by any one of the concerns mentioned above, depending upon the user&#x27;s needs and objectives.

In real-time environments, such as embedded systems for automatic control in industry (for example robotics), the scheduler also must ensure that processes can meet deadlines; this is crucial for keeping the system stable. Scheduled tasks can also be distributed to remote devices across a network and managed through an administrative back end.

==Types of operating system schedulers==
The scheduler is an operating system module that selects the next jobs to be admitted into the system and the next process to run. Operating systems may feature up to three distinct scheduler types: a &quot;long-term scheduler&quot; (also known as an admission scheduler or high-level scheduler), a &quot;mid-term or medium-term scheduler&quot;, and a &quot;short-term scheduler&quot;. The names suggest the relative frequency with which their functions are performed.

===Process scheduler===
The process scheduler is a part of the operating system that decides which process runs at a certain point in time. It usually has the ability to pause a running process, move it to the back of the running queue and start a new process; such a scheduler is known as a &quot;preemptive scheduler&quot;, otherwise it is a &quot;cooperative scheduler&quot;.

We distinguish between &quot;long-term scheduling&quot;, &quot;medium-term scheduling&quot;, and &quot;short-term scheduling&quot; based on how often decisions must be made.

====Long-term scheduling====
The &quot;long-term scheduler&quot;, or &quot;admission scheduler&quot;, decides which jobs or processes are to be admitted to the ready queue (in main memory); that is, when an attempt is made to execute a program, its admission to the set of currently executing processes is either authorized or delayed by the long-term scheduler. Thus, this scheduler dictates what processes are to run on a system, the degree of concurrency to be supported at any one time whether many or few processes are to be executed concurrently, and how the split between I/O-intensive and CPU-intensive processes is to be handled. The long-term scheduler is responsible for controlling the degree of multiprogramming.

In general, most processes can be described as either I/O-bound or CPU-bound. An I/O-bound process is one that spends more of its time doing I/O than it spends doing computations. A CPU-bound process, in contrast, generates I/O requests infrequently, using more of its time doing computations. It is important that a long-term scheduler selects a good process mix of I/O-bound and CPU-bound processes. If all processes are I/O-bound, the ready queue will almost always be empty, and the short-term scheduler will have little to do. On the other hand, if all processes are CPU-bound, the I/O waiting queue will almost always be empty, devices will go unused, and again the system will be unbalanced. The system with the best performance will thus have a combination of CPU-bound and I/O-bound processes. In modern operating systems, this is used to make sure that real-time processes get enough CPU time to finish their tasks.

Long-term scheduling is also important in large-scale systems such as batch processing systems, computer clusters, supercomputers, and render farms. For example, in concurrent systems, coscheduling of interacting processes is often required to prevent them from blocking due to waiting on each other. In these cases, special-purpose job scheduler software is typically used to assist these functions, in addition to any underlying admission scheduling support in the operating system.

Some operating systems only allow new tasks to be added if it is sure all real-time deadlines can still be met.
The specific heuristic algorithm used by an operating system to accept or reject new tasks is the &quot;admission control mechanism&quot;.

====Medium-term scheduling====
The &quot;medium-term scheduler&quot; temporarily removes processes from main memory and places them in secondary memory (such as a hard disk drive) or vice versa, which is commonly referred to as &quot;swapping out&quot; or &quot;swapping in&quot; (also incorrectly as &quot;paging out&quot; or &quot;paging in&quot;). The medium-term scheduler may decide to swap out a process that has not been active for some time, a process that has a low priority, a process that is page faulting frequently, or a process that is taking up a large amount of memory in order to free up main memory for other processes, swapping the process back in later when more memory is available, or when the process has been unblocked and is no longer waiting for a resource.

In many systems today (those that support mapping virtual address space to secondary storage other than the swap file), the medium-term scheduler may actually perform the role of the long-term scheduler, by treating binaries as &quot;swapped-out processes&quot; upon their execution. In this way, when a segment of the binary is required it can be swapped in on demand, or &quot;lazy loaded&quot;, also called demand paging.

====Short-term scheduling====
The &quot;short-term scheduler&quot; (also known as the &quot;CPU scheduler&quot;) decides which of the ready, in-memory processes is to be executed (allocated a CPU) after a clock interrupt, an I/O interrupt, an operating system call or another form of signal. Thus the short-term scheduler makes scheduling decisions much more frequently than the long-term or mid-term schedulers A scheduling decision will at a minimum have to be made after every time slice, and these are very short. This scheduler can be preemptive, implying that it is capable of forcibly removing processes from a CPU when it decides to allocate that CPU to another process, or non-preemptive (also known as &quot;voluntary&quot; or &quot;co-operative&quot;), in which case the scheduler is unable to &quot;force&quot; processes off the CPU.

A preemptive scheduler relies upon a programmable interval timer which invokes an interrupt handler that runs in kernel mode and implements the scheduling function.

====Dispatcher====
Another component that is involved in the CPU-scheduling function is the dispatcher, which is the module that gives control of the CPU to the process selected by the short-term scheduler. It receives control in kernel mode as the result of an interrupt or system call. The functions of a dispatcher involve the following:

* Context switches, in which the dispatcher saves the state (also known as context) of the process or thread that was previously running; the dispatcher then loads the initial or previously saved state of the new process.
* Switching to user mode.
* Jumping to the proper location in the user program to restart that program indicated by its new state.

The dispatcher should be as fast as possible since it is invoked during every process switch. During the context switches, the processor is virtually idle for a fraction of time, thus unnecessary context switches should be avoided. The time it takes for the dispatcher to stop one process and start another is known as the &quot;dispatch latency&quot;.

==Scheduling disciplines==
A scheduling discipline (also called scheduling policy or scheduling algorithm) is an algorithm used for distributing resources among parties which simultaneously and asynchronously request them. Scheduling disciplines are used in routers (to handle packet traffic) as well as in operating systems (to share CPU time among both threads and processes), disk drives (I/O scheduling), printers (print spooler), most embedded systems, etc.

The main purposes of scheduling algorithms are to minimize resource starvation and to ensure fairness amongst the parties utilizing the resources. Scheduling deals with the problem of deciding which of the outstanding requests is to be allocated resources. There are many different scheduling algorithms. In this section, we introduce several of them.

In packet-switched computer networks and other statistical multiplexing, the notion of a scheduling algorithm is used as an alternative to first-come first-served queuing of data packets.

The simplest best-effort scheduling algorithms are round-robin, fair queuing (a max-min fair scheduling algorithm), proportional-fair scheduling and maximum throughput. If differentiated or guaranteed quality of service is offered, as opposed to best-effort communication, weighted fair queuing may be utilized.

In advanced packet radio wireless networks such as HSDPA (High-Speed Downlink Packet Access) 3.5G cellular system, channel-dependent scheduling may be used to take advantage of channel state information. If the channel conditions are favourable, the throughput and system spectral efficiency may be increased. In even more advanced systems such as LTE, the scheduling is combined by channel-dependent packet-by-packet dynamic channel allocation, or by assigning OFDMA multi-carriers or other frequency-domain equalization components to the users that best can utilize them.

===First come, first served===


&quot;First in, first out&quot; (FIFO), also known as &quot;first come, first served&quot; (FCFS), is the simplest scheduling algorithm. FIFO simply queues processes in the order that they arrive in the ready queue. This is commonly used for a , for example as illustrated in this section.

* Since context switches only occur upon process termination, and no reorganization of the process queue is required, scheduling overhead is minimal.
* Throughput can be low, because long processes can be holding the CPU, causing the short processes to wait for a long time (known as the convoy effect).
* No starvation, because each process gets chance to be executed after a definite time.
* Turnaround time, waiting time and response time depend on the order of their arrival and can be high for the same reasons above.
* No prioritization occurs, thus this system has trouble meeting process deadlines.
* The lack of prioritization means that as long as every process eventually completes, there is no starvation. In an environment where some processes might not complete, there can be starvation.
* It is based on queuing.

===Priority scheduling===
Earliest deadline first (EDF) or &quot;least time to go&quot; is a dynamic scheduling algorithm used in real-time operating systems to place processes in a priority queue. Whenever a scheduling event occurs (a task finishes, new task is released, etc.), the queue will be searched for the process closest to its deadline, which will be the next to be scheduled for execution.

===Shortest remaining time first ===
Similar to shortest job first (SJF). With this strategy the scheduler arranges processes with the least estimated processing time remaining to be next in the queue. This requires advanced knowledge or estimations about the time required for a process to complete.

* If a shorter process arrives during another process&#x27; execution, the currently running process is interrupted (known as preemption), dividing that process into two separate computing blocks. This creates excess overhead through additional context switching. The scheduler must also place each incoming process into a specific place in the queue, creating additional overhead.
* This algorithm is designed for maximum throughput in most scenarios.
* Waiting time and response time increase as the process&#x27;s computational requirements increase. Since turnaround time is based on waiting time plus processing time, longer processes are significantly affected by this. Overall waiting time is smaller than FIFO, however since no process has to wait for the termination of the longest process.
* No particular attention is given to deadlines, the programmer can only attempt to make processes with deadlines as short as possible.
* Starvation is possible, especially in a busy system with many small processes being run.
* To use this policy we should have at least two processes of different priority

===Fixed-priority pre-emptive scheduling===
The operating system assigns a fixed-priority rank to every process, and the scheduler arranges the processes in the ready queue in order of their priority. Lower-priority processes get interrupted by incoming higher-priority processes.
* Overhead is not minimal, nor is it significant.
* FPPS has no particular advantage in terms of throughput over FIFO scheduling.
* If the number of rankings is limited, it can be characterized as a collection of FIFO queues, one for each priority ranking. Processes in lower-priority queues are selected only when all of the higher-priority queues are empty.
* Waiting time and response time depend on the priority of the process. Higher-priority processes have smaller waiting and response times.
* Deadlines can be met by giving processes with deadlines a higher priority.
* Starvation of lower-priority processes is possible with large numbers of high-priority processes queuing for CPU time.

===Round-robin scheduling===
The scheduler assigns a fixed time unit per process, and cycles through them. If process completes within that time-slice it gets terminated otherwise it is rescheduled after giving a chance to all other processes.

* RR scheduling involves extensive overhead, especially with a small time unit.
* Balanced throughput between FCFS/FIFO and SJF/SRTF, shorter jobs are completed faster than in FIFO and longer processes are completed faster than in SJF.
* Good average response time, waiting time is dependent on number of processes, and not average process length.
* Because of high waiting times, deadlines are rarely met in a pure RR system.
* Starvation can never occur, since no priority is given. Order of time unit allocation is based upon process arrival time, similar to FIFO.
* If Time-Slice is large it becomes FCFS/FIFO or if it is short then it becomes SJF/SRTF.

===Multilevel queue scheduling===
This is used for situations in which processes are easily divided into different groups. For example, a common division is made between foreground (interactive) processes and background (batch) processes. These two types of processes have different response-time requirements and so may have different scheduling needs. It is very useful for shared memory problems.

===Work-conserving schedulers===
A work-conserving scheduler is a scheduler that always tries to keep the scheduled resources busy, if there are submitted jobs ready to be scheduled. In contrast, a non-work conserving scheduler is a scheduler that, in some cases, may leave the scheduled resources idle despite the presence of jobs ready to be scheduled.

===Scheduling optimization problems===
There are several scheduling problems in which the goal is to decide which job goes to which station at what time, such that the total makespan is minimized:
* Job-shop scheduling there are jobs and identical stations. Each job should be executed on a single machine. This is usually regarded as an online problem.
* Open-shop scheduling there are jobs and different stations. Each job should spend some time at each station, in a free order.
* Flow-shop scheduling there are jobs and different stations. Each job should spend some time at each station, in a pre-determined order.

===Manual scheduling===
A very common method in embedded systems is to schedule jobs manually. This can for example be done in a time-multiplexed fashion. Sometimes the kernel is divided in three or more parts: Manual scheduling, preemptive and interrupt level. Exact methods for scheduling jobs are often proprietary.

* No resource starvation problems
* Very high predictability; allows implementation of hard real-time systems
* Almost no overhead
* May not be optimal for all applications
* Effectiveness is completely dependent on the implementation

===Choosing a scheduling algorithm===
When designing an operating system, a programmer must consider which scheduling algorithm will perform best for the use the system is going to see. There is no universal &quot;best&quot; scheduling algorithm, and many operating systems use extended or combinations of the scheduling algorithms above.

For example, Windows NT/XP/Vista uses a multilevel feedback queue, a combination of fixed-priority preemptive scheduling, round-robin, and first in, first out algorithms. In this system, threads can dynamically increase or decrease in priority depending on if it has been serviced already, or if it has been waiting extensively. Every priority level is represented by its own queue, with round-robin scheduling among the high-priority threads and FIFO among the lower-priority ones. In this sense, response time is short for most threads, and short but critical system threads get completed very quickly. Since threads can only use one time unit of the round-robin in the highest-priority queue, starvation can be a problem for longer high-priority threads.

==Operating system process scheduler implementations==
The algorithm used may be as simple as round-robin in which each process is given equal time (for instance 1 ms, usually between 1 ms and 100 ms) in a cycling list. So, process A executes for 1 ms, then process B, then process C, then back to process A.

More advanced algorithms take into account process priority, or the importance of the process. This allows some processes to use more time than other processes. The kernel always uses whatever resources it needs to ensure proper functioning of the system, and so can be said to have infinite priority. In SMP systems, processor affinity is considered to increase overall system performance, even if it may cause a process itself to run more slowly. This generally improves performance by reducing cache thrashing.

===OS/360 and successors===
IBM OS/360 was available with three different schedulers. The differences were such that the variants were often considered three different operating systems:

* The &quot;Single Sequential Scheduler&quot; option, also known as the &quot;Primary Control Program (PCP)&quot; provided sequential execution of a single stream of jobs.
* The &quot;Multiple Sequential Scheduler&quot; option, known as &quot;Multiprogramming with a Fixed Number of Tasks (MFT)&quot; provided execution of multiple concurrent jobs. Execution was governed by a priority which had a default for each stream or could be requested separately for each job. MFT version II added subtasks (threads), which executed at a priority based on that of the parent job. Each job stream defined the maximum amount of memory which could be used by any job in that stream.
* The &quot;Multiple Priority Schedulers&quot; option, or &quot;Multiprogramming with a Variable Number of Tasks (MVT)&quot;, featured subtasks from the start; each job requested the priority and memory it required before execution.

Later virtual storage versions of MVS added a &quot;Workload Manager&quot; feature to the scheduler, which schedules processor resources according to an elaborate scheme defined by the installation.

===Windows===
Very early MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows systems were non-multitasking, and as such did not feature a scheduler. Windows 3.1x used a non-preemptive scheduler, meaning that it did not interrupt programs. It relied on the program to end or tell the OS that it didn&#x27;t need the processor so that it could move on to another process. This is usually called cooperative multitasking. Windows 95 introduced a rudimentary preemptive scheduler; however, for legacy support opted to let 16-bit applications run without preemption.

Windows NT-based operating systems use a multilevel feedback queue. 32 priority levels are defined, 0 through to 31, with priorities 0 through 15 being &quot;normal&quot; priorities and priorities 16 through 31 being soft real-time priorities, requiring privileges to assign. 0 is reserved for the Operating System. User interfaces and APIs work with priority classes for the process and the threads in the process, which are then combined by the system into the absolute priority level.

The kernel may change the priority level of a thread depending on its I/O and CPU usage and whether it is interactive (i.e. accepts and responds to input from humans), raising the priority of interactive and I/O bounded processes and lowering that of CPU bound processes, to increase the responsiveness of interactive applications. The scheduler was modified in Windows Vista to use the cycle counter register of modern processors to keep track of exactly how many CPU cycles a thread has executed, rather than just using an interval-timer interrupt routine. Vista also uses a priority scheduler for the I/O queue so that disk defragmenters and other such programs do not interfere with foreground operations.

===Classic Mac OS and macOS===
Mac OS 9 uses cooperative scheduling for threads, where one process controls multiple cooperative threads, and also provides preemptive scheduling for multiprocessing tasks. The kernel schedules multiprocessing tasks using a preemptive scheduling algorithm. All Process Manager processes run within a special multiprocessing task, called the &quot;blue task&quot;. Those processes are scheduled cooperatively, using a round-robin scheduling algorithm; a process yields control of the processor to another process by explicitly calling a blocking function such as codice_1. Each process has its own copy of the Thread Manager that schedules that process&#x27;s threads cooperatively; a thread yields control of the processor to another thread by calling codice_2 or codice_3.

macOS uses a multilevel feedback queue, with four priority bands for threadsnormal, system high priority, kernel mode only, and real-time. Threads are scheduled preemptively; macOS also supports cooperatively scheduled threads in its implementation of the Thread Manager in Carbon.

===AIX===
In AIX Version 4 there are three possible values for thread scheduling policy:

* First In, First Out: Once a thread with this policy is scheduled, it runs to completion unless it is blocked, it voluntarily yields control of the CPU, or a higher-priority thread becomes dispatchable. Only fixed-priority threads can have a FIFO scheduling policy.
* Round Robin: This is similar to the AIX Version 3 scheduler round-robin scheme based on 10 ms time slices. When a RR thread has control at the end of the time slice, it moves to the tail of the queue of dispatchable threads of its priority. Only fixed-priority threads can have a Round Robin scheduling policy.
* OTHER: This policy is defined by POSIX1003.4a as implementation-defined. In AIX Version 4, this policy is defined to be equivalent to RR, except that it applies to threads with non-fixed priority. The recalculation of the running thread&#x27;s priority value at each clock interrupt means that a thread may lose control because its priority value has risen above that of another dispatchable thread. This is the AIX Version 3 behavior.

Threads are primarily of interest for applications that currently consist of several asynchronous processes. These applications might impose a lighter load on the system if converted to a multithreaded structure.

AIX 5 implements the following scheduling policies: FIFO, round robin, and a fair round robin. The FIFO policy has three different implementations: FIFO, FIFO2, and FIFO3. The round robin policy is named SCHED_RR in AIX, and the fair round robin is called SCHED_OTHER.

===Linux===

==== Linux 1.2 ====
Linux 1.2 used a round-robin scheduling policy.

==== Linux 2.2 ====
Linux 2.2 added scheduling classes and support for symmetric multiprocessing (SMP).

====Linux 2.4====
In Linux 2.4, an O(n) scheduler with a multilevel feedback queue with priority levels ranging from 0 to 140 was used; 0–99 are reserved for real-time tasks and 100–140 are considered nice task levels. For real-time tasks, the time quantum for switching processes was approximately 200 ms, and for nice tasks approximately 10 ms. The scheduler ran through the run queue of all ready processes, letting the highest priority processes go first and run through their time slices, after which they will be placed in an expired queue. When the active queue is empty the expired queue will become the active queue and vice versa.

However, some enterprise Linux distributions such as SUSE Linux Enterprise Server replaced this scheduler with a backport of the O(1) scheduler (which was maintained by Alan Cox in his Linux 2.4-ac Kernel series) to the Linux 2.4 kernel used by the distribution.

====Linux 2.6.0 to Linux 2.6.22====
In versions 2.6.0 to 2.6.22, the kernel used an O(1) scheduler developed by Ingo Molnar and many other kernel developers during the Linux 2.5 development. For many kernel in time frame, Con Kolivas developed patch sets which improved interactivity with this scheduler or even replaced it with his own schedulers.

====Linux 2.6.23 to Linux 6.5====
Con Kolivas&#x27; work, most significantly his implementation of fair scheduling named Rotating Staircase Deadline (RSDL), inspired Ingo Molnár to develop the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) as a replacement for the earlier O(1) scheduler, crediting Kolivas in his announcement. CFS is the first implementation of a fair queuing process scheduler widely used in a general-purpose operating system.

The CFS uses a well-studied, classic scheduling algorithm called fair queuing originally invented for packet networks. Fair queuing had been previously applied to CPU scheduling under the name stride scheduling. The fair queuing CFS scheduler has a scheduling complexity of formula_1, where is the number of tasks in the runqueue. Choosing a task can be done in constant time, but reinserting a task after it has run requires formula_1 operations, because the run queue is implemented as a red–black tree.

The Brain Fuck Scheduler, also created by Con Kolivas, is an alternative to the CFS.

==== Linux 6.6 ====
In 2023, Peter Zijlstra proposed replacing CFS with an earliest eligible virtual deadline first scheduling (EEVDF) process scheduler. The aim was to remove the need for CFS &quot;latency nice&quot; patches.

==== Linux 6.12 ====
Linux 6.12 added support for userspace scheduler extensions, also known as sched_ext. These schedulers can be installed and replace the default scheduler.

===FreeBSD===
FreeBSD uses a multilevel feedback queue with priorities ranging from 0–255. 0–63 are reserved for interrupts, 64–127 for the top half of the kernel, 128–159 for real-time user threads, 160–223 for time-shared user threads, and 224–255 for idle user threads. Also, like Linux, it uses the active queue setup, but it also has an idle queue.

===NetBSD===
NetBSD uses a multilevel feedback queue with priorities ranging from 0–223. 0–63 are reserved for time-shared threads (default, SCHED_OTHER policy), 64–95 for user threads which entered kernel space, 96-128 for kernel threads, 128–191 for user real-time threads (SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR policies), and 192–223 for software interrupts.

===Solaris===
Solaris uses a multilevel feedback queue with priorities ranging between 0 and 169. Priorities 0–59 are reserved for time-shared threads, 60–99 for system threads, 100–159 for real-time threads, and 160–169 for low priority interrupts. Unlike Linux, when a process is done using its time quantum, it is given a new priority and put back in the queue. Solaris 9 introduced two new scheduling classes, namely fixed-priority class and fair share class. The threads with fixed priority have the same priority range as that of the time-sharing class, but their priorities are not dynamically adjusted. The fair scheduling class uses CPU &quot;shares&quot; to prioritize threads for scheduling decisions. CPU shares indicate the entitlement to CPU resources. They are allocated to a set of processes, which are collectively known as a project.

<text>Nerf Herder is the debut album by Nerf Herder, released in 1996. It was produced by Joey Cape and Ryan Greene.

The album was released as two nearly identical versions by two different labels—both in 1996. The first version was released by independent label My Records (owned by Joey Cape from Lagwagon) as the label&#x27;s debut album. The second version was a reissue by major label Arista Records with slightly different inner artwork, redesigned disc artwork, and an alternate version of the song &quot;Easy Mark.&quot; Using the original recording, the song&#x27;s verses and bridge were rewritten and re-recorded because of similarities to lyrics from &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Believin&#x27;&quot; by Journey.

<text>The Carter Family was a traditional American folk music group that recorded between 1927 and 1956. Their music had a profound influence on bluegrass, country, Southern Gospel, pop and rock music, as well as on the U.S. folk revival of the 1960s.

They were the first vocal group to become country music stars, and were among the first groups to record commercially produced country music. Their first recordings were made in Bristol, Tennessee, for the Victor Talking Machine Company under producer Ralph Peer on August 1, 1927. This was the day before country singer Jimmie Rodgers made his initial recordings for Victor under Peer. 

The success of the Carter Family&#x27;s recordings of songs such as &quot;Wabash Cannonball&quot;, &quot;Can the Circle Be Unbroken&quot;, &quot;Wildwood Flower&quot;, &quot;Keep on the Sunny Side&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m Thinking Tonight of My Blue Eyes&quot; made these songs country standards. The melody of the last was used for Roy Acuff&#x27;s &quot;The Great Speckled Bird&quot;, Hank Thompson&#x27;s &quot;The Wild Side of Life&quot; and Kitty Wells&#x27; &quot;It Wasn&#x27;t God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels&quot;. The song became a hit all over again in these other incarnations.

The original group consisted of Sara Carter, her husband A. P. Carter, and her sister-in-law Maybelle Carter. Maybelle was Sara&#x27;s first cousin, and was married to A.P.&#x27;s brother Ezra Carter (Eck). All three were born and raised in southwest Virginia. They were immersed in the tight harmonies of mountain gospel music and shape note singing. The latter dated to the early 19th century and revivals in the South.

Throughout the group&#x27;s career, Sara Carter sang lead vocals and played rhythm guitar or autoharp. Maybelle sang harmony and played lead guitar. On some songs A.P. did not perform at all; on some songs he sang harmony and background vocals, and occasionally he sang lead. Maybelle&#x27;s distinctive guitar-playing style became a hallmark of the group. Her Carter Scratch (a method for playing both lead and rhythm on the guitar) has become one of the most copied styles of guitar playing. 

The group (in all its incarnations, see below) recorded for a number of labels, including RCA Victor (and subsidiary label, Bluebird), ARC group, Columbia, Okeh and various imprint labels.

==History==
The Carter Family made their first recordings on August 1, 1927. The previous day, A.P. Carter had persuaded his wife Sara Carter and his sister-in-law Maybelle Carter to make the journey from Maces Spring, Virginia, to Bristol, Tennessee, to audition for record producer Ralph Peer. Peer was seeking new talent for the relatively embryonic recording industry. The initial sessions are part of what are now called the Bristol Sessions. The band received $50 for each song recorded, plus a half-cent royalty on every copy sold of each song for which they had registered a copyright. On November 4, 1927, the Victor Talking Machine Company (later RCA Victor) released a double-sided 78 rpm record of the group performing &quot;Wandering Boy&quot; and &quot;Poor Orphan Child&quot;. On December 2, 1928, Victor released &quot;The Storms Are on the Ocean&quot; / &quot;Single Girl, Married Girl&quot;, which became very popular.

By the end of 1930, the Carter Family had sold 300,000 records in the United States. Realizing that he would benefit financially with each new song he collected and copyrighted, A.P. traveled around southwestern Virginia to find songs to record; he also composed new songs. In the early 1930s, he befriended Lesley &quot;Esley&quot; Riddle, a black guitar player from Kingsport, Tennessee. Lesley accompanied A.P. on his song-collecting trips. In June 1931, the Carters did a recording session in Benton, Kentucky, along with Jimmie Rodgers. In 1933, Maybelle met the Speer Family at a fair in Ceredo, West Virginia, fell in love with their signature sound, and asked them to tour with the Carter Family.

==Second generation==

In the winter of 1938–39, the Carter Family traveled to Texas, where they had a twice-daily program on the border radio station XERA (later XERF) in Villa Acuña (now Ciudad Acuña, Mexico), across the border from Del Rio, Texas. 

In the 1939–40 season, the children of A.P. and Sara (Janette and Joe Carter) and those of Maybelle (Helen, June, and Anita) joined the group for radio performances, by then in San Antonio, Texas. Here the programs were prerecorded and distributed to multiple border radio stations. (The children did not, however, perform on the group&#x27;s records.) In the fall of 1942, the Carters moved their program to WBT radio in Charlotte, North Carolina, for a one-year contract. They occupied the sunrise slot, with the program airing between 5:15 and 6:15 a.m.

By 1936, A.P. and Sara&#x27;s marriage had dissolved. After Sara married A.P.&#x27;s cousin, Coy Bayes, they moved to California. The Carter Family disbanded in 1944.

Maybelle continued to perform with her daughters Anita Carter, June Carter, and Helen Carter and recorded on 3 labels (RCA Victor, Columbia and Coronet) as &quot;The Carter Sisters and Mother Maybelle&quot; (sometimes billed as &quot;The Carter Sisters&quot; or &quot;Maybelle Carter and the Carter Sisters&quot; or &quot;Mother Maybelle and the Carter Sisters&quot;). In 1943, Maybelle Carter and her daughters, using the name &quot;the Carter Sisters and Mother Maybelle&quot; had a program on WRNL in Richmond, Virginia. Maybelle&#x27;s brother, Hugh Jack (Doc) Addington Jr., and Carl McConnell, known as the Original Virginia Boys, also played music and sang on the radio show.

Chet Atkins joined them playing electric guitar in 1949 at WNOX radio in Knoxville, Tennessee. He moved with them in October 1949 to KWTO radio in Springfield, Missouri. 

Opry management didn&#x27;t want the Carters to bring Chet when they were offered a regular spot on the Grand Ole Opry but Ezra Carter (their father and manager) insisted that Chet come with them, as he was a part of their band now. Finally the Opry management agreed and Chet went with them when they were hired by WSM and the Grand Ole Opry; their first day was May 29, 1950. Chet worked with them when they did &quot;personals&quot; off and on for 8 years, but mostly on the live Grand Ole Opry performances.
A.P., Sara, and their children Joe and Janette recorded 3 albums in the 1950s under the name of The A.P. Carter Family. 

After the death of A.P. Carter in 1960, Mother Maybelle Carter and the Carter Sisters began using the name &quot;the Carter Family&quot; for their act during the 1960s and 1970s. Maybelle and Sara briefly reunited, recorded a reunion album (&quot;An Historic Reunion&quot;), and toured in the 1960s during the height of folk music&#x27;s popularity.

A film documentary about the family, &quot;Sunny Side of Life&quot;, was released in 1985.

In 1987, reunited sisters June Carter Cash and Helen and Anita Carter, along with June&#x27;s daughter Carlene Carter, appeared as the Carter Family. They were featured on a 1987 television episode of &quot;Austin City Limits&quot;, along with June&#x27;s husband Johnny Cash.

== Third generation ==
The Carter Family name was revived for a third time, under the name Carter Family III. It was a project of descendants of the original Carter Family, John Carter Cash (grandson of Maybelle Carter, son of June Carter Cash and Johnny Cash) and Dale Jett (grandson of A.P. and Sara Carter), along with John&#x27;s wife Laura (Weber) Cash. They released their first album, &quot;Past &amp; Present&quot;, in 2010.

Rosie Nix Adams, daughter of June Carter Cash and her second husband, was also a semi-regular performing member of the Carter Family.

Third Generation family member Carlene Carter (granddaughter of Maybelle Carter) had ventured into pop music before becoming part of the 1987 Carter Family&#x27;s second generation revival.

Notes:

==Legacy and musical style==
As important to country music as the family&#x27;s repertoire of songs was Maybelle&#x27;s guitar playing. She developed her innovative guitar technique largely in isolation; her style is today widely known as the &quot;Carter scratch&quot; or &quot;Carter Family picking&quot;. While Maybelle did use a flatpick on occasion, her major method of guitar playing was the use of her thumb (with a thumbpick) along with one or two fingers. What her guitar style accomplished was to allow her to play melody lines (on the low strings of the guitar) while still maintaining rhythm using her fingers, brushing across the higher strings.

Before the Carter family&#x27;s recordings, the guitar was rarely used as a lead or solo instrument among musicians. Maybelle&#x27;s interweaving of a melodic line on the bass strings with intermittent strums is now a staple of steel string guitar technique. Flatpickers such as Doc Watson, Clarence White and Norman Blake took flatpicking to a higher technical level, but all acknowledge Maybelle&#x27;s playing as their inspiration.

The Carter Family was elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1970 and were given the nickname &quot;The First Family of Country Music&quot;.
In 1988, the Carter Family was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and received its Award for the song &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken&quot;. In 1993, the U.S. Postal Service issued a commemorative postage stamp honoring A.P., Sara, and Maybelle. In 2001, the group was inducted into the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor. In 2005, the group received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.

&quot;Keep on the Sunny Side&quot;, a musical play chronicling the Carter Family&#x27;s rise to stardom, premiered at the Barter Theatre in Abingdon, Virginia, in 2001. Conceived and written by Douglas Pote, the play enjoyed a multiyear run, a national tour spanning 23 states, and an original cast recording; the Barter has also mounted numerous revivals amid lasting popularity.

Renewed attention to the Carter Family tune &quot;When I&#x27;m Gone&quot; occurred after several covers performed a cappella with a cup used to provide percussion, as in the cup game and dubbed the Cups song, went viral and culminated with a short performance in the movie &quot;Pitch Perfect&quot;. Afterwards it was released as a single by Anna Kendrick.

The A. P. and Sara Carter House, A. P. Carter Homeplace, A. P. Carter Store, Maybelle and Ezra Carter House, and Mt. Vernon Methodist Church are listed on the National Register of Historic Places as components of the Carter Family Thematic Resource.

In 2017, the Carter Family&#x27;s story was told in the award-winning documentary series &quot;American Epic.&quot; The film featured unseen film footage of The Carter Family performing and being interviewed, and radically improved restorations of their 1920s recordings. Director Bernard MacMahon commented that &quot;we first came to the Carters through their records, but one of the other things that struck us about them is that they were involved in both of the main waves of America hearing itself for the first time. They made their first impact in that early wave of rural recordings, and then the next stage was the arrival of radio, and in the late 1930s, they went to Texas and were on XERA, a border station based in Mexico that could be heard all over the central and western United States.&quot; The Carter Family&#x27;s story was profiled in the accompanying book, &quot;American Epic: The First Time America Heard Itself&quot;.

==Discography==
Selected 78 rpm records: The Carter Family&#x27;s career predated any sort of best-selling chart of country music records. (&quot;Billboard&quot; did not have a country best sellers chart until 1944.) Below is a select list of their 78 rpm releases.

<text>A PCI Mezzanine Card or PMC is a printed circuit board assembly manufactured to the IEEE P1386.1 standard. This standard combines the electrical characteristics of the PCI bus with the mechanical dimensions of the Common Mezzanine Card or CMC format (IEEE 1386 standard).

A mezzanine connector connects two parallel printed circuit boards in a stacking configuration. Many mezzanine connector styles are commercially available for this purpose, however PMC mezzanine applications usually use the 1.0 mm pitch 64 pin connector described in IEEE 1386. 

A PMC can have up to four 64-pin bus connectors. The first two (&quot;P1&quot; and &quot;P2&quot;) are used for 32 bit PCI signals, a third (&quot;P3&quot;) is needed for 64 bit PCI signals. An additional bus connector (&quot;P4&quot;) can be used for non-specified I/O signals. In addition, arbitrary connectors can be supplied on the front panel of the chassis or case; also known as a &quot;bezel&quot;.

The PMC standard defines which connector pins are used for which PCI signals; in addition it defines the optional 64 &quot;P4&quot; connector pins for use of arbitrary I/O signals.

It enables manufacturers to offer products that are compatible with the well-established PCI bus, but in a smaller and more robust package than standard PCI plug-in cards. The word &quot;mezzanine&quot;, derived from the Italian mezzanino and also commonly used to refer to a platform inserted between two floors of a building, describes the way in which a PMC fits between two adjacent host cards in a standard card rack, attached to one of the cards by connectors and mounting pillars. A single PMC measures 74 mm x 149 mm. The standard also defines a double-sized card, but this is rarely used.

Carrier cards that accept PMCs are usually made in the Eurocard format, which includes single, double and triple-height VMEbus cards, CompactPCI (cPCI) cards and more recently, VPX cards. One PMC fits on a standard 3U carrier card while 6U models (typical for VMEbus cards) can carry up to two PMCs. PMCs were also used in early ATCA systems prior to the advent of the Advanced Mezzanine Card or AMC.

For the PMC standard, I/O technologies account for much of the market, but various card functions are commercially available including Intel architecture and PowerPC processors, graphics cards, and memory cards. I/O cards are available such as serial communication controllers, SCSI controllers, graphics controllers and FireWire controllers.

==Variants==
Additional standards exist that define variants of the standard PMC. For example,
* PMC-X (PCI-X PMC) defined by the VITA 39 standard
* PPMC (aka PrPMC; processor PMC) defined by the VITA 32 standard. I.e. for allowing processors to have host or monarch, support on a PMC. Additional signaling is defined so that the PrPMC can work as the host processor on a PCI bus. The intention is to allow a monarch PMC to control the PCI bus. This is usually a requirement if the PMC is to act as a host processor module.
* CCPMC (conduction-cooled PMC) defined by the VITA 20 standard
* XMC, or Switched Mezzanine Card, (PMC with high-speed serial fabric interconnect) defined by the VITA 42 standard. XMC specifies a fifth connector (&quot;P15&quot;) that supports PCI Express (VITA 42.3) or other high speed serial formats such as Serial RapidIO (VITA 42.2) and Parallel RapidIO (VITA 42.1).
*FMC – FPGA Mezzanine Card provides a standard mezzanine form factor that offers a flexible, modular I/O interface to an FPGA located on a host system baseboard or carrier card.
* OAI-OAM (Open Accelerator Infrastructure - Accelerator Module) standard from Open Compute Project, describes AI accelerator cards for blade servers, up to 8 cards on a universal base board, each with 7 PCIe x16 links, 12 V or 48 to 60 V power line, up to 600 W TBP (total board power) with air cooling, 600+ W with liquid cooling, interchangeable heatsinks and coldplates.

<doc id="231935" wikidata="Q3638996" url="?curid=231935" title="Best Before 1984">
<text>Best Before 1984 is a compilation of Crass&#x27; singles and other tracks, released in 1986, including lyrics and a booklet (&quot;...In Which Crass Voluntarily &#x27;Blow Their Own&#x27;&quot;) which details the history of the band in their own words. The album was named in reference to the notion that 1984 was the band&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;sell by date&quot;, the year that they had often publicly stated that they would split up. Indeed, the band ceased gigging and recording in that year.

For many years, there were plans to release an expanded edition of &quot;Best Before 1984&quot;, which would include currently unavailable material (such as the &quot;Merry Crassmas&quot; and &quot;Whodunnit?&quot; singles) and rarities, in the same vein as the &#x27;Crassical Collection&#x27; re-releases of the band&#x27;s albums. These plans finally came to fruition in 2019, with the announcement of an expanded two-disc version of the album available for pre-order on the One Little Indian website. Between 1 and 5 April 2019, Crass made the first disc of this reissue available for free download from their social media pages. The reissued album was finally released on 2 October 2020 on the now-renamed One Little Independent Records, including CD-sized replicas of the original poster covers from the singles.

<doc id="231936" wikidata="Q3675592" url="?curid=231936" title="Christ – The Album">
<text>Christ – The Album is the fourth album by Crass, released in 1982. It was released as a boxed-set, double-vinyl LP package, including one disc of new studio material and another, entitled &quot;Well Forked.. But Not Dead&quot;, a live recording of the band&#x27;s June 1981 gig at the 100 Club in London along with other studio tracks, demos and tape fragments. The box also included a book, &quot;A Series of Shock Slogans and Mindless Token Tantrums&quot; (featuring Penny Rimbaud&#x27;s essay &quot;The Last of the Hippies&quot;, telling the story of the suspicious death of his friend Wally Hope), and a large poster painted by Gee Vaucher. The album was well received and the band considered it their best.

In 2011, a two-disc remastered CD edition of the album was released as a part of the band&#x27;s &quot;Crassical Collection&quot; reissue series. This edition featured extra content, with the studio album (and the bonus tracks) featured on the first disc and the live album featured on the second disc. On 2 October 2020, the &quot;Crassical Collection&quot; edition was reissued, with the bonus tracks added to the second disc.

==Background and release==
Unlike previous Crass albums, &quot;Christ&quot; took almost a year to record, produce and mix, during which time the Falklands War had taken place. This caused Crass to fundamentally question their approach to making records. As a group whose very reason for existing was to comment on political issues, they felt that they had been overtaken and made to appear redundant by real-world events.

For subsequent releases, including the singles &quot;How Does It Feel to Be the Mother of a Thousand Dead&quot;, &quot;Sheep Farming in the Falklands&quot; and the album &quot;Yes Sir, I Will&quot;, the band stripped their sound &quot;back to basics&quot;, issuing the singles as &quot;tactical responses&quot; to political situations.

Rereleases of the album bear the line &quot;With love to Steve Herman who died on the 4th of February 1989&quot; on the back cover. Herman was Crass&#x27; guitar player during their first few months.

==Reception==

&quot;Christ&quot; – &quot;The Album&quot; is considered by former members of Crass to be among their best recordings. In a retrospective article written for the album, Harry Sword of &quot;The Quietus&quot; refers to it as &quot;the most caustic realization of their vision&quot; and called it &quot;a seething howl that remains most intensely relevant to politics and vibrantly forward thinking in terms of music.&quot; &quot;Trouser Press&quot; referred to it as &quot;quintessential&quot; for it &quot;proves the band&#x27;s courage and conviction.&quot;

Reviewing the album in &quot;NME&quot;, Paul Du Noyer wrote: &quot;There&#x27;s always something exciting about such raw passion; anger which hits you so hard that every idea in your head gets shook up, violently.&quot;

<doc id="231938" wikidata="Q126643" url="?curid=231938" title="Chinstrap penguin">
<text>The chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarcticus) is a species of penguin that inhabits a variety of islands and shores in the Southern Pacific and the Antarctic Oceans. Its name stems from the narrow black band under its head, which makes it appear as if it were wearing a black helmet, making it easy to identify. Other common names include ringed penguin, bearded penguin, and stonecracker penguin, due to its loud, harsh call.

== Taxonomy ==
This species was originally given the scientific name &quot;Aptenodytes antarctica&quot; by Johann Reinhold Forster in 1781, thereby placing it in the same genus as the king and emperor penguins. In 1990, Graham Turbott transferred this species into the genus &quot;Pygoscelis&quot;, together with the Adélie and gentoo penguins. This gave it the new name &quot;P. antarctica&quot;. However, this is an orthographic error due to the disagreement in Latin grammar between &quot;antarctica&quot; and its assigned genus. The corrected form, &quot;P. antarcticus&quot;, is the currently accepted name for this species.

== Description ==

The chinstrap penguin grows to a length of and a weight of , with the weight varying with the time of year. Males are greater in weight and height than females.

The adult chinstrap&#x27;s flippers are black with a white edge; the inner sides of the flippers are white. The face is white extending behind the eyes, which are reddish brown; the chin and throat are white, as well, while the short bill is black. The strong legs and the webbed feet are pink. Its short, stumpy legs give it a distinct waddle when it walks. The chinstrap penguin&#x27;s black back and white underside provide camouflage in the form of countershading when viewed from above or below, helping to avoid detection by its predators.

== Distribution ==
Chinstrap penguins have a circumpolar distribution. They breed in Antarctica, Argentina, Bouvet Island, Chile, the French Southern Territories, and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. Vagrant individuals have been found in New Zealand, the islands of Saint Helena and Tristan da Cunha, and South Africa.

== Ecology ==
The diet of the chinstrap penguin consists of small fish, krill, shrimp, and squid, which they swim up to offshore each day to obtain. The chinstrap penguin&#x27;s tightly packed feathers provide a waterproof coat, enabling it to swim in freezing waters. Additionally, thick blubber deposits and intricate blood vessels in the flippers and legs assist in the preservation of heat.

The main predator of the chinstrap penguin at sea is the leopard seal (&quot;Hydrurga leptonyx&quot;). Every year, the leopard seal causes the chinstrap&#x27;s population to decrease by about 5% to 20%. On land, the brown skua (&quot;Stercorarius antarcticus&quot;), south polar skua (&quot;Stercorarius maccormicki&quot;), and southern giant petrel (&quot;Macronectes giganteus&quot;) are the primary predators of the penguin. These three species most often prey on eggs and young chinstrap penguins. The Antarctic fur seal is also known to occasionally kill chinstrap penguins.

== Behaviour ==
On land, they build circular nests from stones, and lay two eggs, which are incubated by both the male and the female for shifts around 6 days each. The chicks hatch after around 37 days, and have fluffy grey backs and white fronts. The chicks stay in the nest for 20–30 days before they go to join other chicks in a crèche. Around 50–60 days old, they moult, gaining their adult feathers and go to sea.

Chinstrap penguins are generally considered to be the most aggressive and ill-tempered species of penguin.

Chinstrap penguins microsleep over 10,000 times a day and accomplish this in 4 second bouts of sleep. The sleep can be both bihemispheric and unihemispheric slow-wave sleep. The penguins accumulate over 11 hours of sleep for each hemisphere daily.

=== Roy and Silo ===

In 2004, two male chinstrap penguins named Roy and Silo in Central Park Zoo, New York City, formed a pair bond and took turns trying to &quot;hatch&quot; a rock, for which a keeper eventually substituted a fertile egg, and the pair subsequently hatched and raised the chick. Penguins by nature hatch eggs and are social creatures. The children&#x27;s book &quot;And Tango Makes Three&quot; was written based on this event.

== Conservation status ==
In 2018, the IUCN estimated that the population of chinstrap penguins was around 8 million specimens. Although it is believed to be decreasing overall, its population is not severely fragmented and in many sites it is increasing or stable. The species is classified as least concern on the IUCN Red List as of 2016, due to its large range and population, following five previous assessments of the same status from 2004 to 2012 and three assessments as &quot;unknown&quot; from 1988 to 2000.

The chinstrap penguin is primarily threatened by climate change. In several parts of its range, climate change decreases the abundance of krill, which likely makes reproduction less successful. For instance, a 2019 expedition to breeding grounds on Elephant Island showed a fifty percent population decline in just under fifty years. Other potential threats include volcanic events and the fishing of krill by humans.

<text>Frederick William Rolfe (surname pronounced ), better known as Baron Corvo (Italian for &quot;Crow&quot;), and also calling himself Frederick William Serafino Austin Lewis Mary Rolfe (22 July 1860 – 25 October 1913), was an English writer, artist, photographer and eccentric.

==Life==

Rolfe was born in Cheapside, London, the son of piano maker and tuner James Rolfe (c. 1827-1902) and Ellen Elizabeth, née Pilcher. He left school at the age of fourteen and became a teacher. He taught briefly at The King&#x27;s School, Grantham, where the then headmaster, Ernest Hardy, later principal of Jesus College, Oxford, became a lifelong friend.

He converted to Roman Catholicism in 1886 and was confirmed by Cardinal Manning. With his conversion came a strongly-felt vocation to the priesthood, which persisted throughout his life despite being constantly frustrated and never realised. In 1887 he was sponsored to train at St Mary&#x27;s College, Oscott, near Birmingham and in 1889 was a student at the Pontifical Scots College in Rome, but was thrown out by both due to his inability to concentrate on priestly studies and his erratic behaviour.

At this stage he entered the circle of the Duchess Sforza Cesarini, who, he claimed, adopted him as a grandson and gave him the use of the title of &quot;Baron Corvo&quot;. This became his best-known pseudonym; he also called himself &quot;Frank English&quot;, &quot;Frederick Austin&quot; and &quot;A. Crab Maid&quot;, among others. More often he abbreviated his own name to &quot;Fr. Rolfe&quot; (an ambiguous usage, suggesting he was the priest he had hoped to become).

Rolfe spent most of his life as a freelance writer, mainly in England but eventually in Venice. He lived in the era before the welfare state, and relied on benefactors for support but he had an argumentative nature and a tendency to fall out spectacularly with most of the people who tried to help him and offer him room and board. Eventually, out of money and out of luck, he died in Venice from a stroke on 25 October 1913. He was buried in the San Michele cemetery on the Isola di San Michele in Venice.

Rolfe&#x27;s life provided the basis for &quot;The Quest for Corvo&quot; by A. J. A. Symons, an &quot;experiment in biography&quot; regarded as a minor classic in the field. This same work reveals that Rolfe had an unlikely enthusiast in the person of Maundy Gregory.

==Homosexuality==

Rolfe was entirely comfortable with his homosexuality and associated and corresponded with a number of other homosexual Englishmen. Early in his life he wrote a fair amount of idealistic but mawkish poetry about boy martyrs and the like. These and his Toto stories contain pederastic elements, but the young male pupils he was teaching at the time unanimously recalled in later life that there had never been any hint of impropriety in his relations with them. As he himself matured, Rolfe&#x27;s settled sexual preference was for late adolescents. Towards the end of his life he made his only explicit reference to his specific sexual age preference, in one of the Venice letters to Charles Masson Fox, in which he declared: &quot;My preference was for the 16, 17, 18 and large.&quot; Grant Richards, in his &quot;Memories of a Misspent Youth&quot; (1932), recalls &quot;Frederick Baron Corvo&quot; at Parson&#x27;s Pleasure in Oxford – where scholars could bathe naked – &quot;surveying the yellow flesh tints of youth with unbecoming satisfaction&quot;.

Those of whom it is either speculated or surmised that they had sexual relations with Rolfe – Aubrey Thurstans, Sholto Osborne Gordon Douglas, John &#x27;Markoleone&#x27;, Ermenegildo Vianello and the other Venetian gondoliers – were all sexually mature young men between the ages of sixteen and twenty-one (with the exception of Douglas, who was considerably older). The idealised young men in his fiction were of a similar age.

In 1904, soon after his ordination as a Roman Catholic priest, the convert Robert Hugh Benson formed a chaste but passionate friendship with Rolfe. For two years this relationship involved letters &quot;not only weekly, but at times daily, and of an intimate character, exhaustingly charged with emotion.&quot; There was a falling out in 1906. For some time previously, Benson had made plans to write jointly with Rolfe a book on St Thomas Becket, but Benson decided that he should not be associated (according to writer Brian Masters) &quot;with a Venetian pimp and procurer of boys&quot;. Afterwards, Benson satirised Rolfe in his novel &quot;The Sentimentalists&quot;. Rolfe returned the favour a few years later, putting a caricature of Benson named &quot;Bobugo Bonsen&quot; in a book named &quot;Nicholas Crabbe&quot;. Their letters were subsequently destroyed, probably by Benson&#x27;s brother.

Rolfe sought to characterise the relationships in his fiction as examples of &#x27;Greek love&#x27; between an older man and an ephebe, and thus endow them with the sanction of the ancient Hellenic tradition familiar to all Edwardians with a classical education.

==Work==

===Principal works of fiction===
Rolfe&#x27;s most important and enduring works are the stories and novels in which he himself is the thinly-disguised protagonist:

*&quot;Stories Toto Told Me&quot; (1898), a collection of six stories, later expanded to thirty-two and republished as &quot;In His Own Image&quot; (1901), in which ‘Don Friderico’ and his teenage acolytes embark on long walking tours in the Italian countryside, even as far from Rome as the eastern coast of Italy. The youths’ leader, the sixteen-year-old Toto, recounts tales of saints behaving like pagan gods. The stories are richly Catholic and unashamedly superstitious, and the saints who figure in them are hedonistic, vengeful and (though not licentious) entirely comfortable with nudity, diametrically opposite to any Protestant ideal of sainthood.
*&quot;Hadrian the Seventh&quot; (1904), with an original and compelling plot, is Rolfe&#x27;s most famous novel. Rolfe portrays himself as an Englishman with a quintessentially English name, &#x27;George Arthur Rose,&#x27; (after Saint George, King Arthur, and England&#x27;s national flower) who, having originally been rejected for the priesthood, finds himself the object of a spectacular and highly improbable change of mind on the part of the church hierarchy, who then elect him to the papacy. Rose takes the name Hadrian VII and embarks upon a programme of ecclesiastical and geopolitical reform; the only English pope was Hadrian IV, and the last non-Italian pope had been Hadrian VI. More self-indulgently, he takes the opportunity to review his past life and to reward or punish his friends and acquaintances according to what he believes to be their just deserts. &quot;Hadrian&quot; is thus essentially an exercise in wish-fulfilment.
*&quot;Nicholas Crabbe&quot; (written 1900–1904, published 1958) tells the story of Rolfe&#x27;s first attempts to achieve publication, with starring roles for Henry Harland, John Lane and Grant Richards. In this novel Rolfe has given himself a new fictional name, &#x27;Nicholas Crabbe,&#x27; and its plot is a blow-by-blow chronicle of events, reproducing many of the publishers&#x27; letters and Rolfe&#x27;s replies to them. &quot;Nicholas Crabbe&quot; is an undistinguished novel, but it is rich in autobiographical detail.
*&quot;The Desire and Pursuit of the Whole&quot; (written 1910–1913, thought lost, found in Chatto &amp; Windus&#x27;s safe, published 1934) is set in Venice and reintroduces the reader to &#x27;Nicholas Crabbe.&#x27; It has three interlocking plots: Crabbe’s efforts to get his books published, in the face of obstacles placed in their way by his friends and agents in England, and his consequent economic difficulties; his rescue of a sixteen-year-old girl from the Messina earthquake and employment of her as his assistant and gondolier, dressed in male garments to avoid scandal; and the transcendent beauty of Venice itself and the role it plays in the lives of its votaries. Extracts from the novel’s beautiful descriptions of Venice appear regularly in guidebooks and modern anthologies. Unlike Rolfe’s other novels, this one ends happily, with a lucrative book contract and a declaration of love. &quot;The desire and pursuit of the whole&quot; is the definition of love, according to Aristophanes in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot;.

In 1912, the year before his death, Rolfe began to write another autobiographical novel, &quot;The Freeing of the Soul, or The Seven Degrees&quot; (written 1912–1913, published 1995), of which only a few pages have survived. Set in the fifth century, the novel was to have as its protagonist a middle-aged Byzantine bishop named Septimius, preoccupied with the likelihood of another of the barbarian attacks which had been terrifying his Venetian flock. The novel was a departure for Rolfe, as his four previous autobiographical works had been set in his own time.

===Other writings===

Rolfe wrote four other novels: &quot;Don Tarquinio&quot; (1905), &quot;Don Renato&quot; (1909), &quot;The Weird of the Wanderer&quot; (1912), and &quot;Hubert&#x27;s Arthur&quot; (published posthumously in 1935). Both &quot;The Weird&quot; and &quot;Hubert&#x27;s Arthur&quot; were collaborations with Harry Pirie-Gordon. These works differ from the autobiographical novels in two respects: they are set in previous centuries, and the principal protagonist in each is not Rolfe&#x27;s &quot;alter ego&quot;, although there is a strong degree of identification. In &quot;The Weird of the Wanderer&quot; the hero, Nicholas Crabbe, becomes a time traveller and discovers that he is Odysseus.

Rolfe also wrote shorter fiction, published in contemporary periodicals and collected after his death in &quot;Three Tales of Venice&quot; (1950), &quot;Amico di Sandro&quot; (1951), &quot;The Cardinal Prefect of Propaganda&quot; (1957) and &quot;The Armed Hands&quot; (1974). He also published an entertaining but unreliable work of history, &quot;Chronicles of the House of Borgia&quot; (1901), translations of &quot;The Rubáiyát of Umar Khaiyám&quot; (1903) and &quot;The Songs of Meleager&quot; (published posthumously in 1937), and a little poetry, later gathered into one volume, &quot;Collected Poems&quot; (1974).

===Letters===

Rolfe was an obsessive letter writer. John Holden recalled that &quot;Corvo was one of those men who never speak a word if they can write it. We lived in the same house, a very little one, yet he would always communicate with me by note if I was not in the same room with him. He had dozens of letter books. He seized upon every opportunity for writing a letter, and every letter, whether to a publisher or to a cobbler, was written with the same care.&quot; About a thousand of his letters have survived, and several sequences of them have been published in limited editions. The letters reveal a lively, intelligent and absorbent mind, but because of Rolfe’s paranoiac tendencies they are often disputatious and recriminatory. Among the commentators who rated Rolfe’s letters more highly than his fiction was the poet W H Auden, who wrote that Rolfe &quot;had every right to be proud of his verbal claws … A large vocabulary is essential to the invective style, and Rolfe by study and constant practice became one of the great masters of vituperation.&quot; The letters have yet to be collected into a single scholarly edition.

==Photography and painting==

===Photography===
Rolfe took an interest in photography throughout his life, but never achieved any more than basic competence. While he began to experiment with photography when he was a schoolmaster, it was his time in Rome in 1889–90 that introduced him to the work of the &#x27;Arcadian&#x27; photographers Wilhelm von Gloeden and Guglielmo Plüschow. His seminary, the Scots College, was quite close to Plüschow&#x27;s studio in via Sardegna, just off the via Veneto, and when Rolfe was expelled from the College and came under the benevolent patronage of the Duchess Sforza Cesarini, he began his own photographic efforts in imitation of von Gloeden and Plüschow. His models were the local &quot;ragazzi&quot; from the streets of Genzano di Roma, a town dominated by the Duchess&#x27;s &quot;palazzo&quot;. These youths were later to become the principal characters in Rolfe&#x27;s Toto stories, published first in &quot;The Yellow Book&quot; in 1895–96 and later collected in &quot;Stories Toto Told Me&quot; in 1898 and &quot;In His Own Image&quot; in 1901.

Rolfe continued to indulge his interest in photography in Christchurch in Dorset in 1890–91, upon his return from Rome, and experimented with colour and underwater pictures. He began to lose interest, however, and really only took photography up again when he returned to Italy in 1908. His photographic career has been fully documented in Donald Rosenthal&#x27;s book &quot;The Photographs of Frederick Rolfe Baron Corvo 1860–1913&quot;, which was published in 2008.

===Painting===

Rolfe never lost his conviction that he had been called to the Catholic priesthood. When he worked in his late teens and early twenties as a schoolmaster, and later when he tried his hand at painting and photography, he saw these as stop-gap occupations, means of earning an income until the Church authorities came to their senses and agreed with his own firm view that he had a priestly vocation.

It was for this reason that Rolfe never undertook any formal training in either painting or photography. His paintings and designs, including several for the covers of his own books, were bold and surprisingly accomplished amateur efforts. He executed some of the most impressive of them when he was living in Christchurch in 1890 and 1891, including a small but striking oil painting of St Michael.

From 1895 to 1899 he lived in Holywell in Flintshire in North Wales, where he painted some fourteen processional banners, commissioned by the parish priest there, Fr Charles Sidney Beauclerk. Rolfe painted the figures of the saints and John Holden assisted with the lettering on the borders. Only five of the banners have survived, and may still be seen in the Holywell Well Museum; they are colourful representations, in a naive style, of Saints Winefride, George, Ignatius, Gregory the Great and Augustine of Canterbury.

Rolfe produced no further paintings after he became a full-time writer.

==Posthumous literary reputation==

Rolfe&#x27;s early books were politely reviewed but none of them was enough of a success to secure an income for its author, whose posthumous reputation began to dim. Within a very few years, however, coteries of readers began to discover a common interest in his work, and a resilient literary cult began to form. In 1934 A. J. A. Symons published &quot;The Quest for Corvo&quot;, one of the century&#x27;s iconic biographies, and this brought Rolfe&#x27;s life and work to the attention of a wider public. In the 1950s and 1960s, there was a further surge of interest in him which became known as &quot;the Corvo revival&quot;, including a successful adaptation of &quot;Hadrian&quot; for the London stage. Two biographies of Rolfe appeared in the 1970s. These led to his inclusion in all the major works of reference and engendered a stream of academic theses on him. Although his books have remained in print, no substantial monograph has ever appeared in English on his work. With the growing academic interest in the history of literary modernism and acknowledgement of the central importance of life writing in its genesis, the true importance of Rolfe’s autobiographical fictions has come into focus. His influence has been discerned in novels written by Henry Harland, Ronald Firbank, Graham Greene, and Alexander Theroux, and in his coinage of neologisms and use of the Ulysses story there is some perhaps coincidental prefiguring of the work of James Joyce.

<text>Tarashcha or Tarascha (, ) is a city in Bila Tserkva Raion, Kyiv Oblast (region) in central Ukraine. It hosts the administration of Tarashcha urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. Population: 

==History==
Tarashcha is an historic Cossack town (in the 17th century through 17th century - rather a city). It was founded when the area was under the ultimate control of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

Until the mid-20th century, the town had a significant Jewish community, being a shtetl. The town was occupied by the German army on July 23, 1941.

Jews were forced to wear armbands with the Star of David, were not allowed to buy food and were relegated to forced labour. Afterward, a ghetto was established on Tarasha Street. Executions of the Jewish population were carried out by German security forces, S.S. Viking Division, detachment of Einsatzgruppe, in cooperation with Einsatzkommando 5 and local police. The execution of Jews started from the very first days of German occupation. Several executions were conducted. The main actions took place in August 1941, with 400 Jewish victims; on September 10, 1941, during which several hundred Jews were killed; while on November 9, 1941, the ghetto was liquidated. Altogether, up to 1,000 Jews were exterminated in Tarashcha between August and November 1941.

===Modern developments===
Recently, the town has become known as the place of the clandestine burial and later recovery of Georgiy Gongadze, a Ukrainian journalist kidnapped and murdered in 2000.
Also, the Tarashcha Raion is closely associated with the prominent Ukrainian politician Oleksandr Moroz: he was born and started his career here, later became elected to the parliament from the local constituency. Moroz is the most notable and influential person in the neighborhood. There were even speculations between these two facts and Moroz&#x27;s significant role in Gongadze case and Cassette Scandal.

Until 18 July 2020, Tarashcha was the administrative center of Tarashcha Raion. The raion was abolished that day as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Kyiv Oblast to seven. The area of Tarashcha Raion was merged into Bila Tserkva Raion.

<doc id="231943" wikidata="Q1186677" url="?curid=231943" title="Humility">
<text>Humility is the quality of being humble. The Oxford Dictionary, in its 1998 edition, describes humility as low self-regard and a sense of unworthiness. However, humility involves having an accurate opinion of oneself and expressing oneself modestly as situations demand, with clear goal orientation, openness, broad-mindedness, and a non-imposing mentality. In a religious context, humility can mean a recognition of self about a deity (i.e. God) and subsequent submission to that deity as a religious member. Outside of a religious context, humility is defined as being &quot;unselved&quot;—liberated from the consciousness of self—a form of temperance that is neither having pride (or haughtiness) nor indulging in self-deprecation.

Humility refers to a proper sense of self-regard. In contrast, humiliation involves the external imposition of shame on a person. One may misinterpret humility as the capacity to endure humiliation through self-denigration. This misconception arises from the confusion of humility with traits like submissiveness and meekness. Such misinterpretations prioritize self-preservation and self-aggrandizement over true humility, which emphasizes an undiminished focus on the self.

In many religious and philosophical traditions, humility is regarded as a virtue that prioritizes social harmony. It strikes a balance between two sets of qualities. This equilibrium lies in having a reduced focus on oneself, which leads to lower self-importance and diminished arrogance, while also possessing the ability to demonstrate strength, assertiveness, and courage. This virtue is exhibited in the pursuit of upholding social harmony, recognizing our human dependence on it. It contrasts with maliciousness, hubris, and other negative forms of pride, and is an idealistic and rare intrinsic construct that has an extrinsic side.

==Term==
The term &quot;humility&quot; comes from the Latin word , a noun related to the adjective , which may be translated as &quot;humble&quot;, but also as &quot;grounded&quot;, or &quot;from the earth&quot;, since it derives from (earth). See the English &quot;humus&quot;.

The word &quot;humble&quot; may be related to feudal England where the least valuable cuts of meat, or &quot;umbles&quot; (whatever was left over when the upper classes had taken their parts), were provided to the lowest class of citizen.

==Mythology==
Aidos, in Greek mythology, was the (goddess) of shyness, shame, and humility. She was the quality that restrained human beings from wrong.

==Religious views of humility==

===Abrahamic===

====Judaism====

Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks states that, in Judaism, humility is an appreciation of oneself, one&#x27;s talents, skills, and virtues. It is not meekness or self-deprecating thought, but the effacing of oneself to something higher. Humility is not to think lowly of oneself, but to appreciate the self one is. In recognition of the mysteries and complexities of life, one becomes humbled to the vastness of what one is and what one can achieve.

Rabbi Pini Dunner discusses that humility is to place others first; it is to appreciate others&#x27; worth as important. In recognizing our worth as people, Rabbi Dunner shows that looking into the zillions of stars in the sky, and in the length and history of time, you and I are insignificant, like dust. Rabbi Dunner states that Moses wrote in the Torah, &quot;And Moses was exceedingly humble, more than any man on the face of the earth&quot;(). How is it possible to be humble and write you are the most humble? The conclusion is that Moses knew he was humble. It is not in denial of your talents and gifts but to recognize them and live up to your worth and something greater. It is in the service to others that is the greatest form of humility.

The deuterocanonical Book of Sirach has a section on humility in chapter 3, which commences &quot;My son, conduct your affairs with humility, and you will be loved more than a giver of gifts&quot;. The editors of the New American Bible Revised Edition suggest that the writer &quot;is perhaps warning his students [in this section] against the perils of Greek philosophy&quot;.

Amongst the benefits of humility described in the Hebrew Bible, that is shared by many faiths, are honor, wisdom, prosperity, the protection of the Lord, and peace. In addition, &quot;God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble&quot; () is another phrase in the Hebrew Bible that values humility and humbleness.

====Christianity====
New Testament exhortations to humility are found in many places, for example &quot;Blessed are the meek&quot; (), &quot;He who exalts himself will be humbled and he who humbles himself will be exalted&quot; (), as well as () and throughout the Book of James. In fact, Jesus Christ&#x27;s behavior and submission to unjust torture and execution in particular are held up as examples of righteous humility: &quot;Who, when he was reviled, did not revile: when he suffered, he threatened not: but delivered himself to him that judged him justly&quot; ().

C. S. Lewis writes in &quot;Mere Christianity&quot; that pride is the &quot;anti-God&quot; state, the position in which the ego and the self are directly opposed to God: &quot;Unchastity, anger, greed, drunkenness, and all that, are mere fleabites in comparison: it was through Pride that the devil became the devil: Pride leads to every other vice: it is the complete anti-God state of mind.&quot; In contrast, Lewis contends that in Christian moral teaching the opposite of pride is humility. This is popularly illustrated by a phrase wrongly attributed to Lewis, &quot;Humility is not thinking less of yourself, but thinking of yourself less.&quot; This is an apparent paraphrase, by Rick Warren in &quot;The Purpose Driven Life&quot;, of a passage found in &quot;Mere Christianity&quot;: Lewis writes, regarding the truly humble man, 

St. Augustine stresses the importance of humility in the study of the Bible, with the exemplars of a barbarian Christian slave, the apostle Paul, and the Ethiopian eunuch in Acts 8. Both learner and teacher need to be humble, because they learn and teach what ultimately belongs to God. Humility is a basic disposition of the interpreter of the Bible. The confidence of the exegete and preacher arises from the conviction that his or her mind depends on God absolutely. Augustine argues that the interpreter of the Bible should proceed with humility, because only a humble person can grasp the truth of Scripture.

One with humility is said to be a fit recipient of grace; according to the words of St. James, &quot;God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble&quot; (, , ).

&quot;True humility&quot; differs from &quot;false humility&quot; which consists of deprecating one&#x27;s own sanctity, gifts, talents, and accomplishments for the sake of receiving praise or adulation from others. That sort is personified by the fictional character Uriah Heep created by Charles Dickens. In this context legitimate humility comprises the following behaviors and attitudes:
* submitting to God and legitimate authority
* recognizing virtues and talents that others possess, particularly those that surpass one&#x27;s own, and giving due honor and, when required, obedience
* recognizing the limits of one&#x27;s talents, ability, or authority

The vices opposed to humility are:
* Pride
* Too great obsequiousness or abjection of oneself; this would be considered an excess of humility, and could easily be derogatory to one&#x27;s office or holy character; or it might serve only to pamper pride in others, by unworthy flattery, which would occasion their sins of tyranny, arbitrariness, and arrogance. The virtue of humility may not be practiced in any external way that would occasion vices in others.

=====Catholicism=====
Catholic texts view humility as annexed to the cardinal virtue of temperance. It is viewed as a potential part of temperance because temperance includes all those virtues that restrain or express the inordinate movements of our desires or appetites.

Bernard of Clairvaux defines it as “a virtue by which a man knowing himself as he truly is, abases himself. Jesus Christ is the ultimate definition of Humility.&quot;

Humility was a virtue extolled by Francis of Assisi, and this form of Franciscan piety led to the artistic development of the &quot;Madonna of humility&quot; first used by them for contemplation. The Virgin of humility sits on the ground, or upon a low cushion, unlike the &quot;Enthroned Madonna&quot; representations. This style of painting spread quickly through Italy, and, by 1375, examples began to appear in Spain, France, and Germany. It became the most popular among the styles of the early Trecento artistic period.

Thomas Aquinas, a 13th-century philosopher and theologian in the Scholastic tradition, says &quot;the virtue of humility... consists in keeping oneself within one&#x27;s own bounds, not reaching out to things above one, but submitting to one&#x27;s superior&quot;.

====Islam====
In the Qur&#x27;an, various Arabic words conveying the meaning of &quot;humility&quot; are used. The very term &quot;Islam&quot; can be interpreted as &quot;surrender (to God), humility&quot;, from the triconsonantal root S-L-M; other words used are and : 



===Eastern===

====Buddhism====
Buddhism is a religion of &quot;self&quot;-examination. The natural aim of the Buddhist life is the state of enlightenment, gradually cultivated through meditation and other spiritual practices. Humility, in this context, is a characteristic that is both an essential part of the spiritual practice, and a result of it. As a quality to be developed, it is deeply connected with the practice of Four Abodes (Brahmavihara): love-kindness, compassion, empathetic joy, and equanimity. As a result of the practice, this cultivated humility is expanded by the wisdom acquired by the experience of ultimate emptiness () and non-self (). Humility, compassion, and wisdom are intrinsic parts of the state of enlightenment. On the other hand, not being humble is an obstacle on the path of enlightenment which needs to be overcome. In the Tipitaka (the Buddhist scriptures), criticizing others and praising oneself is considered a vice; but criticizing oneself and praising others is considered a virtue. Attachment to the self, apart from being a vice in itself, also leads to other evil states that create suffering.

In the Tipitaka, in the widely known &quot;Mangala Sutta&quot;, humility (, literally: &quot;without air&quot;) is mentioned as one of the thirty-eight blessings in life. In the Pāli Canon, examples of humility include the monk Sariputta Thera, a leading disciple of the Buddha, and Hatthaka, a leading lay disciple. In later Pali texts and Commentaries, Sariputta Thera is depicted as a forgiving person, who is quick to apologize and accepting of criticism. In the (discourses of the Buddha) Hatthaka was praised by the Buddha when he was unwilling to let other people know his good qualities.

In Buddhist practice, humility is practiced in a variety of ways. Japanese Soto Zen monks bow and chant in honor of their robes before they don them. This serves to remind them of the connection of the monk&#x27;s robes with enlightenment. Buddhist monks in all traditions are dependent on the generosity of laypeople, through whom they receive their necessities. This in itself is a practice of humility.

====Hinduism====
In Sanskrit literature, the virtue of humility is explained with many terms, some of which use the root word, (). comes from . Related words include (), (, humility towards), and the concept , listed as the first virtue in the Bhagavad Gita. is a fusion word for &quot;pridelessness&quot; and the virtue of &quot;humility&quot;. Another related concept is (), which means &quot;modest and humble behavior&quot;.

Different scholars have varying interpretations of , humility, as a virtue in the Bhagavad Gita. For example, Prabhupada explains humility to mean one should not be anxious to have the satisfaction of being honored by others. The material conception of life makes us very eager to receive honor from others, but from the point of view of a man in perfect knowledge—who knows that he is not this body—anything—honor or dishonor—pertaining to this body is useless.

Tanya Jopson explains , humility, as lack of arrogance and pride, and one of twenty-six virtues in a human being that if perfected, leads one to a divine state of living and the ultimate truth.

Eknath Easwaran writes that the Gita&#x27;s subject is &quot;the war within, the struggle for self-mastery that every human being must wage if he or she is to emerge from life victorious&quot;, and &quot;The language of battle is often found in the scriptures, for it conveys the strenuous, long, drawn-out campaign we must wage to free ourselves from the tyranny of the ego, the cause of all our suffering and sorrow&quot;. To get in touch with your true self, whether you call that God, Brahman, etc., you have to let go of the ego. The Sanskrit word literally translates into The-sound-of-I, or quite simply the sense of the self or ego.

Mahatma Gandhi interprets the concept of &quot;humility&quot; in Hinduism much more broadly, where humility is an essential virtue that must exist in a person for other virtues to emerge. To Mahatma Gandhi, Truth can be cultivated, as well as Love, but Humility cannot be cultivated. Humility has to be one of the starting points. He states, &quot;Humility cannot be an observance by itself. For it does not lend itself to being practiced. It is however an indispensable test of ahimsa (non-violence).&quot; Humility must not be confused with mere manners; a man may prostrate himself before another, but if his heart is full of bitterness for the other, it is not humility. Sincere humility is how one feels inside, it&#x27;s a state of mind. A humble person is not himself conscious of his humility, says Gandhi.

Swami Vivekananda, a 19th century scholar of Hinduism, argues that the concept of humility does not mean &quot;crawling on all fours and calling oneself a sinner&quot;. In Vivekananda&#x27;s Hinduism, each human being the Universal, recognizing and feeling oneness with everyone and everything else in the universe, without inferiority or superiority or any other bias, is the mark of humility. To Dr. S Radhakrishnan, humility in Hinduism is the non-judgmental state of mind when we are best able to learn, contemplate and understand everyone and everything else.

====Sikhism====


Baba Nand Singh Ji Maharaj said about Guru Nanak that Humility is the Divine Flavour, the most wonderful fragrance of the Lotus Feet of Lord Guru Nanak. There is no place for Ego (referred to in Sikhism as ) in the sphere of Divine Love, in the sphere of true . That is why in the House of Guru Nanak one finds Humility reigning supreme. Guru Nanak was an Incarnation of Divine Love and a Prophet of True Humility.

According to Sikhism, all people equally have to bow before God so there ought to be no hierarchies among or between people. According to Nanak the supreme purpose of human life is to reconnect with (The Timeless One), however, egotism is the biggest barrier in doing this. Using the guru&#x27;s teaching remembrance of (the divine Word) leads to the end of egotism. The immediate fruit of humility is intuitive peace and pleasure. With humility continue to meditate on the Lord, the treasure of excellence. The God-conscious being is steeped in humility. One whose heart is mercifully blessed with abiding humility. Sikhism treats humility as a begging bowl before the god.

Sikhs extend this belief in equality, and thus humility, towards all faith: &quot;all religious traditions are equally valid and capable of enlightening their followers&quot;. In addition to sharing with others Guru Nanak inspired people to earn an honest living without exploitation and also to remember the divine name (God). Guru Nanak described living an &quot;active, creative, and practical life&quot; of &quot;truthfulness, fidelity, self-control, and purity&quot; as being higher than a purely contemplative life.

Baba Nand Singh Sahib is renowned as the most humble Sikh Saint in the history of Sikhism. One time the disciples of Baba Harnam Singh Ji, the spiritual preceptor of Baba Nand Singh Ji Maharaj asked him how much power He had transmitted to Baba Nand Singh Ji Maharaj to which he replied:

====Meher Baba====
The spiritual teacher Meher Baba held that humility is one of the foundations of devotional life: &quot;Upon the altar of humility we must offer our prayers to God.&quot; Baba also described the power of humility to overcome hostility: &quot;True humility is strength, not weakness. It disarms antagonism and ultimately conquers it.&quot; Finally, Baba emphasized the importance of being humble when serving others: &quot;One of the most difficult things to learn is to render service without bossing, without making a fuss about it and without any consciousness of high and low. In the world of spirituality, humility counts at least as much as utility.&quot;

====Taoism====
Humility, in Taoism, is defined as a refusal to assert authority or a refusal to be first in anything. The act of daring, in itself, is a refusal of wisdom and a rush to enjoin circumstances before you are ready. Along with compassion and frugality, humility is one of the three treasures (virtues) in the possession of those who follow the Tao.

The treasure of humility, in Chinese is a six-character phrase instead of a single word: &quot;not dare to be first/ahead in the world&quot;. Ellen Chen notes that:
The third treasure, daring not be at the world&#x27;s front, is the Taoist way to avoid premature death. To be at the world&#x27;s front is to expose oneself, to render oneself vulnerable to the world&#x27;s destructive forces, while to remain behind and to be humble is to allow oneself time to fully ripen and bear fruit. This is a treasure whose secret spring is the fear of losing one&#x27;s life before one&#x27;s time. This fear of death, out of a love for life, is indeed the key to Taoist wisdom. 

Furthermore, also according to the Tao Te Ching a wise person acts without claiming the results as his. He achieves his merit and does not rest (arrogantly) in it. He does not wish to display his superiority.

===Wicca===

In the numerous traditions of initiatory Wicca, called in the U.S.A. &quot;British Traditional Wicca&quot;, four paired &amp; balanced qualities are recommended in liturgical texts as having come from the Wiccan Goddess:

In the matter of humility, this deific instruction appropriately pairs being honorable with being humble. Characteristically, this Wiccan &quot;virtue&quot; is balanced by its partner virtue.

==Philosophical views of humility==

Kant&#x27;s view of humility has been defined as &quot;that meta-attitude that constitutes the moral agent&#x27;s proper perspective on himself as a dependent and corrupt but capable and dignified rational agent&quot;. Kant&#x27;s notion of humility relies on the centrality of truth and rational thought leading to proper perspective and his notion can therefore be seen as emergent.

Mahatma Gandhi said that an attempt to sustain truth without humility is doomed to become an &quot;arrogant caricature&quot; of truth.

While many religions and philosophers view humility as a virtue, some have been critical of it, seeing it as opposed to individualism.

&quot;No doubt, when modesty was made a virtue, it was a very advantageous thing for the fools,&quot; wrote Arthur Schopenhauer, &quot;for everybody is expected to speak of himself as if he were one&quot;.

Nietzsche viewed humility as a strategy used by the weak to avoid being destroyed by the strong. In &quot;Twilight of the Idols&quot; he wrote: &quot;When stepped on, a worm doubles up. That is clever. In that way he lessens the probability of being stepped on again. In the language of morality: humility.&quot; He believed that his idealized would be more apt to roam unfettered by pretensions of humility, proud of his stature and power, but not reveling idly in it, and certainly not displaying hubris. But, if so, this would mean the pretension aspect of this kind of humility is more akin to obsequiousness and to other kinds of pretentious humility.

==Humility and leadership==
Research suggests that humility is a quality of certain types of leaders and is studied as a trait that can enhance leadership effectiveness. For example, Jim Collins and his colleagues found that a certain type of leader, whom they term &quot;level 5&quot;, possesses humility and fierce resolve. The research suggests that humility is multi-dimensional and includes self-understanding and awareness, openness, and perspective taking.

<text>Giovanni Michelotti (6 October 1921 – 23 January 1980) was one of the most prolific designers of sports cars in the 20th century. His notable contributions were for Ferrari, Lancia, Maserati and Triumph marques. He was also associated with truck designs for Leyland Motors, and with designs for British Leyland (including the Leyland National bus) after the merger of Leyland and BMC.

Born in Turin, Italy, Michelotti worked for coachbuilders, including Stabilimenti Farina, Vignale, Allemano, Bertone, Ghia, Ghia-Aigle, Scioneri, Monterosa, Viotti, Fissore and OSI, before opening his own design studio in 1959. He also cooperated with manufacturers producing their own cars based on Fiat or other mechanicals, like Siata, Moretti, Francis Lombardi and Nardi. From 1962, Michelotti concluded cooperation with Carrozzeria Vignale and began his own coachbuilding activities.

Towards the end of his life, asked whether he had ever designed anything other than cars, Michelotti acknowledged that virtually all of his design work had involved cars, but he admitted to having designed a coffee making machine shortly after the war.

==Standard Triumph==

From the late 1950s Michelotti was responsible for all new models produced by the British company Standard Triumph, starting with a facelift of the Standard Vanguard and going on to design other models for Triumph such as: 
* Triumph Herald
* Triumph Spitfire
* Triumph GT6
* Triumph TR4
* Triumph TR5 Ginevra
* Triumph 2000
* Triumph 1300
* Triumph Vitesse
* Triumph Stag
* Triumph Dolomite
He also created a number of prototypes which did not go into production, such as the Triumph Fury. The only Triumphs after 1960 that were not his work were the TR6 and the TR7, plus the Honda-based Acclaim.
== British Leyland ==

After Triumph&#x27;s parent company Leyland Motors became a part of British Leyland, Michelotti undertook a facelift of the BMC 1100 – which became the Spanish-built Austin Victoria and also the South African-built Austin Apache. He also designed the Leyland National bus and the Australian-made Leyland P76.

== BMW ==

Giovanni Michelotti&#x27;s BMW association started with the BMW 700 (1959) and later the successful BMW New Class series of designs of which the most notable is the BMW 2002. He also created the 02-Series 2000 Touring model. His sport sedan designs later became the BMW design language, that was continued and refined by Ercole Spada well into the 1980s.

==DAF/Volvo==

Michelotti also worked with the Dutch firm DAF, starting in 1963 with redesigning the ageing Daffodil 31 model into the Daffodil 32 and DAF 33. The Shellette beach car was also originally developed to use DAF underpinnings. The DAF 44 (1966) was a completely new design from his hand and he also helped form its derivatives 46, 55 and 66, which culminated in the Volvo 66 (1975). In 1968, Michelotti built a concept car based on his DAF 55 design, called Siluro (Italian for torpedo), which remained in his possession until his death. The car has since been restored and is in possession of the DAF museum in Eindhoven.

==Own work==

Michelotti did present a few cars under his own name. The Shellette was a beach car with wicker seats and dashboard in the spirit of Ghia&#x27;s, Fiat 500 and 600 Jollys. The Shellette was designed in collaboration with yacht designer Philip Schell. Originally constructed with DAF underpinnings, this was later changed to Fiat 850 mechanicals. Unlike the Ghia Jolly, the more powerful Shellette was a reasonably useful car having a heater and various other creature comforts. It was also capable of a cruising speed. Only about 80 were built, with around ten still in existence. Famous buyers included the Dutch Royal Family, who used an early DAF-based Shellette at their summer property in Porto Ercole, and Jacqueline Onassis, who employed a later model on the Onassis&#x27; private island Skorpios.

Around 1980, the Fiat 127-based &quot;Every&quot; appeared, a light buggy-styled vehicle. Michelotti also marketed a luxurious version of the Daihatsu Taft. In 1985 the Michelotti PAC was presented, a one-off citycar prototype (PAC = &quot;Project Automotive Commuter&quot;) based on the Daihatsu Cuore.

== Scammell ==

In the 1960s, Michelotti designed a glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) cab for certain lorries made by Scammell, who had become part of Leyland Motors in 1955. The cab was used for the Routeman, Handyman and Trunker models. The Townsman also had a Michelotti designed cab.

<text>&#x27; or &#x27; (, ; pl. &quot;shtetlekh&quot;) is a Yiddish term for small towns with predominantly Ashkenazi Jewish populations which existed in Eastern Europe before the Holocaust. The term is used in the context of former Eastern European Jewish societies as mandated islands within the surrounding non-Jewish populace, and thus bears certain connotations of discrimination. (or , , or ) were mainly found in the areas that constituted the 19th-century Pale of Settlement in the Russian Empire (constituting modern-day Belarus, Lithuania, Moldova, Ukraine, Poland, Latvia and Russia), as well as in Congress Poland, Austrian Galicia and Bukovina, the Kingdom of Romania and the Kingdom of Hungary.

In Yiddish, a larger city, like Lviv or Chernivtsi, is called a (), and a village is called a (). is a diminutive of with the meaning &#x27;little town&#x27;. Despite the existence of Jewish self-administration (/), officially there were no separate Jewish municipalities, and the was referred to as a or (, in Russian bureaucracy), a type of settlement which originated in the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and was formally recognized in the Russian Empire as well. For clarification, the expression &quot;Jewish &quot; was often used.

The as a phenomenon of Ashkenazi Jews in Eastern Europe was destroyed by the Nazis during the Holocaust. The term is sometimes used to describe largely Jewish communities in the United States, such as existed on the Lower East Side of New York City in the early 20th century, and predominantly Hasidic communities such as Kiryas Joel and New Square today.

==Overview==
A is defined by Yohanan Petrovsky-Shtern as &quot;an East European market town in private possession of a Polish magnate, inhabited mostly but not exclusively by Jews&quot; and from the 1790s onward and until 1915 shtetls were also &quot;subject to Russian bureaucracy&quot;, as the Russian Empire had annexed the entire Lithuania and the eastern part of Poland, and was administering the area where the settlement of Jews was permitted. The concept of culture describes the traditional way of life of East European Jews. In literature by authors such as Sholem Aleichem and Isaac Bashevis Singer, shtetls are portrayed as pious communities following Orthodox Judaism, socially stable and unchanging despite outside influence or attacks.

==History==
The history of the oldest Eastern European began around the 13th century. Throughout this history, &quot;shtetls&quot; saw periods of relative tolerance and prosperity as well as times of extreme poverty and hardships, including pogroms in the 19th-century Russian Empire. According to Mark Zborowski and Elizabeth Herzog (1962):

The May Laws introduced by Tsar Alexander III of Russia in 1882 banned Jews from rural areas and towns of fewer than ten thousand people. In the 20th century, revolutions, civil wars, industrialisation and the Holocaust destroyed traditional existence.

The decline of the started from about the 1840s. Contributing factors included poverty as a result of changes in economic climate (including industrialisation which hurt the traditional Jewish artisan and the movement of trade to the larger towns), repeated fires destroying the wooden homes, and overpopulation. Also, the anti-Semitism of the Russian Imperial administrators and the Polish landlords, as well as the resultant pogroms in the 1880s, made life difficult for residents of the &quot;shtetl&quot;. From the 1880s until 1915 up to 2 million Jews left Eastern Europe. At the time about three-quarters of its Jewish population lived in areas defined as &quot;s&quot;. The Holocaust resulted in the total extermination of these towns. It was not uncommon for the entire Jewish population of a to be rounded up and murdered in a nearby forest or taken to the various concentration camps. Some inhabitants were able to emigrate before and after the Holocaust, which resulted in many Ashkenazi Jewish traditions being passed on. However, the as a community of Ashkenazi Jews in Eastern Europe, as well as much of the culture specific to this way of life, was all but eradicated by the Nazis.

===Modern usage===

In the later part of the 20th century, Hasidic Jews founded new communities in the United States, such as Kiryas Joel and New Square, and they sometimes use the term &quot;&quot; to refer to these enclaves in Yiddish, particularly those with village structures.

In Europe, the Orthodox community in Antwerp, Belgium, is widely described as the last , composed of about 12,000 people. The Gateshead, United Kingdom Orthodox community is also sometimes called a &quot;shtetl&quot;.

Brno, Czech Republic, has a significant Jewish history and Yiddish words are part of the now dying-out Hantec slang. The word &quot;&quot; (pronounced ) refers to Brno itself.

Qırmızı Qəsəbə, in Azerbaijan, thought to be the only 100% Jewish community not in Israel or the United States, has been described as a .

==Culture==


Not only did the Jews of the speak Yiddish, a language rarely spoken by outsiders, but they also had a unique rhetorical style, rooted in traditions of Talmudic learning:

 provided a strong sense of community. The &quot;at its heart, it was a community of faith built upon a deeply rooted religious culture&quot;. A Jewish education was most paramount in . Men and boys could spend up to 10 hours a day dedicated to studying at a . Discouraged from Talmudic study, women would perform the necessary tasks of a household. In addition, shtetls offered communal institutions such as synagogues, ritual baths and ritual food processors.

 (charity) is a key element of Jewish culture, both secular and religious, to this day. was essential for Jews, many of whom lived in poverty. Acts of philanthropy aided social institutions such as schools and orphanages. Jews viewed giving charity as an opportunity to do a good deed ().

This approach to good deeds finds its roots in Jewish religious views, summarized in Pirkei Avot by Shimon Hatzaddik&#x27;s &quot;three pillars&quot;:

Material things were neither disdained nor extremely praised in the . Learning and education were the ultimate measures of worth in the eyes of the community, while money was secondary to status. As the formed an entire town and community, residents worked diverse jobs such as shoe-making , metallurgy, or tailoring of clothes. Studying was considered the most valuable and hardest work of all. Learned men who did not provide bread and relied on their wives for money were not frowned upon but praised.

There is a belief found in historical and literary writings that the disintegrated before it was destroyed during World War II; however, Joshua Rosenberg of the Institute of East-European Jewish Affairs at Brandeis University argued that this alleged cultural break-up is never clearly defined. He argued that the whole Jewish life in Eastern Europe, not only in , &quot;was in a state of permanent crisis, both political and economic, of social uncertainty and cultural conflicts&quot;. Rosenberg outlines a number of reasons for the image of &quot;disintegrating &#x27;&quot; and other kinds of stereotyping. For one, it was an &quot;anti-&quot; propaganda of the Zionist movement. Yiddish and Hebrew literature can only to a degree be considered to represent the complete reality. It mostly focused on the elements that attract attention, rather than on an &quot;average Jew&quot;. Also, in successful America, memories of , in addition to sufferings, were colored with nostalgia and sentimentalism.

<text>Barret Eugene Hansen (born April 2, 1941), known professionally as Dr. Demento, is an American radio broadcaster and record collector specializing in novelty songs, comedy, and strange or unusual recordings dating from the early days of phonograph records to the present. Hansen created the Demento persona in 1970 while working at the Pasadena, California, station KPPC-FM. After he once played &quot;Transfusion&quot; by Nervous Norvus on the radio, DJ &quot;The Obscene&quot; Steven Clean said that Hansen had to be &quot;demented&quot; to play it; this event inspired his stage name. His weekly show went into syndication in 1974 and was syndicated by the Westwood One Radio Network from 1978 to 1992. Broadcast syndication of the show ended on June 6, 2010, but the show continues to be produced weekly in an online version.

Hansen holds a master&#x27;s degree in ethnomusicology and has written magazine articles and liner notes on recording artists outside of the novelty genre. He is credited with introducing new generations of listeners to artists of the early and middle 20th century whom they might not have otherwise discovered, such as Harry McClintock, Spike Jones, Jimmy Durante, Benny Bell, Rusty Warren, Yogi Yorgesson, Nervous Norvus, Allan Sherman, Ray Stevens, Candy Candido, Stan Freberg, and Tom Lehrer, as well as helping to bring &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic to national attention.

== Early life ==
Barret Hansen was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the son of an amateur pianist. He claims to have started his vast record collection as early as age 12, when he found &quot;that a local thrift store had thousands of old 78 RPM records for sale at 5 cents each&quot;. He attended Reed College in Portland, Oregon, where he was promoted to Program Director of KRRC in 1960 and General Manager in 1961. He wrote his senior thesis on Alban Berg&#x27;s opera &quot;Wozzeck&quot; and Claude Debussy&#x27;s opera &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot;. He graduated in 1963, and later studied at UCLA, from which he earned a master&#x27;s degree in folklore and ethnomusicology.

After earning his master&#x27;s degree, he lived for two years &quot;in a big house on a hill&quot; in Topanga Canyon with members of the rock band Spirit. He also served briefly as a roadie for Spirit, and for Canned Heat, before being hired as an A&amp;R man, or talent scout, for Specialty Records. The Doctor began his weekly radio show while working for Specialty, and he later worked for Warner Bros. Records. He was responsible for preparing many of the &quot;Warner/Reprise Loss Leaders&quot; mail-order compilation albums of rock music issued in the 1970s, which featured new artists and new material from established Warner and Reprise Records artists. These were advertised on the inner sleeves of WB&#x27;s current releases—and were only available by ordering direct from WB using a coupon printed on the record sleeve—and were priced at $1 per LP. Most of these releases were two-LP sets, so they were priced at $2 at a time when a &quot;double LP&quot; typically carried a $9.98 list price. Using his real name of Barry Hansen, he also contributed many articles on rock music to magazines including &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Down Beat&quot;, and &quot;Hit Parader&quot;, liner notes on various late 1960s and early 1970s albums, and in 1976 contributed the chapter on &quot;Rhythm and Gospel&quot; in &quot;The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock &amp; Roll&quot;.

== Career ==

=== The Dr. Demento radio show ===

Hansen created the persona of Dr. Demento in 1970 while working at KPPC in Pasadena, California. The positive listener response to the offbeat novelties that Hansen included in his rock oldies show led to his eventually turning it into an all-novelty show. At the end of 1971, he moved to KMET in Los Angeles. From 1972 to 1983, he performed a four-hour live show on KMET. From about 1974 on, the local Los Angeles market was the full 4 hours and the nationally syndicated show was cut to 2 hours. The show became a two-hour live show on KLSX and, after that station converted to a talk-only format in 1995, moved again to KSCA, where it remained until that station changed to a Spanish-language format, in February 1997.

His weekly show went into national syndication in a two-hour all-novelty format in 1974, produced by his manager Larry Gordon of Gordon/Casady and during 1978–92 was syndicated by the Westwood One Radio Network. The Westwood One period marked the height of the show&#x27;s national popularity; it was carried in most major radio markets, airing mainly on FM rock stations, usually late on Sunday evenings. The producer Westwood One assigned to work with Hansen from 1978 to 1982 was Lynnsey Guererro, a former track star from UCLA and Senior Producer at the company. In 1982, he handed off the show to a new producer from San Diego, professional journalist Robert Young. It was under Young&#x27;s guidance that the show gained in popularity, mainly due to his willingness to foster relationships with national media and with nationally known and up-and-coming artists, including John Mammoser, Judy Tenuta, Emo Philips, Pinkard and Bowden, Wally Wingert, and Mark Davis (Richard Cheese). Young accompanied Dr. Demento to Portland, Oregon; Dallas, Texas; New York City; San Diego; Montreal; Phoenix; and other cities to do live performances and PR Events, taking photos, setting up interviews and even &#x27;running the board&#x27; at some of the live shows. He left the radio network in 1990 during a business downturn. In January 2014 Young released an e-book titled &quot;Producing Demento,&quot; about his memories of working on the show.

From 1992 to 2000, the show was syndicated by On the Radio Broadcasting. Hansen, under the name &quot;Talonian Productions,&quot; handled syndication himself from 2000 until discontinuing syndication in 2010 (Hansen revealed that he was the owner of Talonian when responding to significant criticism of the company in 2007; Talonian had no involvement in any other show than Dr. Demento). Between the mid-1970s and the mid-1990s, Hansen continued to do live broadcasts on KMET and other Los Angeles area stations, in addition to his weekly taped syndicated show. He also made occasional television appearances, on such shows as &quot;The Gong Show&quot; (on the 1988–89 revival), &quot;Bobby&#x27;s World&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and on the Barnes and Barnes music video for &quot;Fish Heads&quot;.

The syndicated radio show normally started with an hour of randomly chosen records and listener requests. The second hour was normally mostly devoted to a specific theme (cars, sports, pets, romance, movies, etc.) with a final segment taken up by a &quot;The Funny Five&quot; countdown of the most requested songs. There were also shows devoted to holidays and seasonal events, with the most important being the Halloween and Christmas shows (Hansen produced multiple Christmas shows during the holiday season consisting solely of novelty Christmas music), because of the large number of novelty records those holidays have inspired. The final radio episode each year was the Funny 25, a countdown of the 25 most requested novelty songs that year (see below). For most of the syndicated show&#x27;s history, Hansen produced 52 original weekly shows every year; repeat broadcasts were rare.

The program&#x27;s opening theme is an instrumental version of &quot;Pico and Sepulveda&quot; recorded for the show by The Roto Rooter Good Time Christmas Band (during the early years on KMET, it had been “Sugar Blues” by Clyde McCoy). The same Los Angeles area group recorded some of the musical teasers used on the show, such as &quot;It&#x27;s time for number one...&quot; The other &quot;countdown&quot; intros come from &quot;Barstow&quot; by the American maverick composer Harry Partch. Hansen&#x27;s opening line, &quot;Wind up your radios,&quot; refers to the rare 78rpm novelty records from the days of wind-up phonographs that he has featured on the show, especially in its early years. The closing theme is &quot;Cheerio, Cherry Lips, Cheerio,&quot; a 1929 vocal by Scrappy Lambert (recording under the name Gordon Wallace), which Hansen tells listeners he discovered in a thrift shop. The Doctor closes each show with &quot;Stay Dement-ed!&quot;

Since 1987, and continuing as of 2024, Whimsical Will (real name: William Simpson) produces a weekly &quot;Demented News&quot; segment for the show. He also has recorded fake comedy interviews &quot;break-in&quot; style, following Dickie Goodman, including &quot;Hey Dickie&quot; (1989), which is available on iTunes.

Starting in the late 1980s, the show began to lose affiliates, a victim of media consolidation and other changes in the radio industry that were pushing many alternative rock stations and individualistic broadcasters off the air. In 1992, Westwood One dropped the show which was immediately picked up by another syndicator, On the Radio Broadcasting. This allowed the syndicated show to air records which were popular on the local Los Angeles show, but Westwood One would not allow, such as &quot;It&#x27;s A Gas&quot; by Alfred E. Neuman and &quot;Moose Turd Pie&quot; by Utah Phillips. It also allowed Whimsical Will&#x27;s Demented News, a fixture of the local Los Angeles show, to air on the national show.

In 2000, Hansen formed Talonian Productions to syndicate the show himself. According to Hansen, the show steadily lost advertisers, and as such, he had to restructure the distribution of the show from the usual barter system to a system in which stations paid a rights fee for the program (though he apparently made exceptions in some major markets, such as WLUP-FM in Chicago). He stated in October 2007 that &quot;unless the show&#x27;s financial situation changes soon, I will be unable to continue the show much longer.&quot; After approximately two and a half years, and no significant change in the show&#x27;s financial situation, the Dr. Demento official website announced on June 6, 2010, that the show that aired that weekend would be the final broadcast in the terrestrial radio version; however, new episodes of the online streaming version would still continue to be produced for the foreseeable future, with new episodes posted every Saturday. In addition, according to the site, &quot;...by special agreement and due to contractual considerations, a version of the internet show will be heard weekly on KACV-FM (in Amarillo, Texas), at least through the summer.&quot; The show was removed from KACV-FM in January 2011.

=== Online streaming ===
Beginning in approximately 2006, &quot;The Dr. Demento Show&quot; began offering pay-per-show audio streaming at the show&#x27;s official website. Large archives from 1992 to the present, as well as a few select archives from the early 1970s, are available, early on most of the syndicated programs from 1978 to 1992 were not because the broadcast rights were in limbo due to corporate changes at Westwood One; Talonian eventually resecured the rights to the Westwood One programs in 2012. The first Westwood One show from February 26, 1978 became available in November, 2012. Some live local shows which aired in Los Angeles from this period were added. As part of the contract between Dr. Demento and radio stations, radio stations were prohibited from streaming the program online. Several radio stations were forced to drop the program because of this policy, thus reducing Dr. Demento&#x27;s affiliate count (at the end of the show&#x27;s terrestrial run only six stations were carrying the show, versus over 100 at its peak), further exacerbating the show&#x27;s financial problems and inability to sell advertising. Despite the show&#x27;s terrestrial cancellation, new online episodes are expected to be produced for the foreseeable future. The show ended its terrestrial broadcast on a cliffhanger, with the last terrestrial broadcast devoted to songs involving the word &quot;big&quot; and the first post-terrestrial broadcast devoted to songs involving the word &quot;little.&quot;

The online show follows a format similar to that of the terrestrial show; no longer being limited by a radio time slot or commercial breaks, the show usually exceeds two hours and may include &quot;bonus tracks&quot; at the end of the show. The weekly &quot;Funny Five&quot; has been replaced by a monthly Top Ten in order to allow for more comprehensive special topic segments. The new format, along with the ability to play records that previously would have been censored on the radio, has allowed Hansen to delve more deeply into his collection than was possible on the syndicated radio show.

=== Other media ===

From 2003 to 2005, XM Satellite Radio aired a weekly &quot;Best of Dr. Demento&quot; show (featuring a mixture of old and new material) initially on the Special X channel and then on the 60s on 6, Deep Tracks, and Laugh USA channels.

He was interviewed in the 2005 documentary film about outsider musician Wild Man Fischer, titled &quot;&quot;. In September 2007, Dr. Demento portrayed the role of Hippocrates on &quot;The Radio Adventures of Dr. Floyd.&quot;

In addition to his syndicated show, he still makes occasional guest appearances for other shows. Among his guest-hosting stints were for Montel Williams on the now-defunct Air America Media (despite the network&#x27;s politically driven format, the guest stint followed his normal format of novelty music, specifically Halloween music, since the show aired on October 30, 2009, the day before Halloween) on &quot;Anything Anything with Rich Russo&quot; on Super Bowl Sunday in 2011 and 2013, and annually with classical music host Jim Svejda on New Year&#x27;s Eve until Svejda retired in 2022.

In April 2013, Meep Morp Studios began seeking donations to fund a documentary named &quot;Under the Smogberry Trees: The True Story of Dr. Demento&quot; through Kickstarter. &quot;Under the Smogberry Trees&quot; was meant to be a filmed history of “The Dr. Demento Show”, covering the lasting impact of funny music on popular culture, and including current interviews with Dementites connected to and/or inspired by the show. The Kickstarter campaign ended successfully on May 4, 2013, with a total of $118,722 in donations from 1,764 backers. On September 27, 2016, Hansen announced he had terminated his support for Meep Morp&#x27;s version of the film, was working on producing his own version of &quot;Under the Smogberry Trees&quot; with Devin Lucas as director, and forbade Meep Morp from continuing to use his name or likeness for their film. Meep Morp stated that, after the film had substantially been completed and the studio prepared to begin taping the interview portions with Hansen in July 2014, he abruptly refused the interview and issued a cease and desist order to the studio instead, stating that he and Talonian would be taking full control of the film and its profits. Neither version of the film has been released as of 2023.

=== Honors ===
Dr. Demento has been inducted into both the Comedy Music Hall of Fame (in June 2005) and the National Radio Hall of Fame (in November 2009). Dr. Demento was inducted into the Oregon Music Hall of Fame in 2014.

== Personal life ==

Hansen was married to Sue Hansen (née Sue Charles) from 1983 until her death on September 10, 2017. Their relationship was childless by choice. Sue was a former clerk and training officer at the Union Pacific railroad for 12 years. Hansen describes himself as &quot;an armchair railfan&quot;, sometimes sampling his extensive collection of railroad-related songs on his show.

Hansen has a long time interest in the roots of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll in R&amp;B and country music, and he has written about it in many magazine articles, liner notes to compilations and new recordings by a variety of artists, and two chapters on early R&amp;B for &quot;The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock &amp; Roll&quot;. His shows and public appearances display an encyclopaedic knowledge of the history of recorded music in general, from the earliest Edison cylinder recordings onward.

His personal collection includes over 85,000 records.

== Influence ==

Dr. Demento may be best known for bringing parodist &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic to national attention. In 1976, Hansen spoke at Yankovic&#x27;s school where Yankovic gave a self-recorded tape of comedy songs and parodies to Hansen. The first song, &quot;Belvedere Cruisin&quot; about the family station wagon, was featured on the show. Positive listener response encouraged Yankovic to record more parodies; Hansen then funded Yankovic&#x27;s first EP, &quot;Another One Rides the Bus&quot;, which eventually led to a record deal and pop chart success in the 1980s and beyond. Hansen has appeared in a number of Weird Al&#x27;s music videos as well as in Weird Al&#x27;s movie &quot;UHF&quot;.

Other artists who attained widespread exposure after getting exposure on the Dr. Demento show include Barnes &amp; Barnes (&quot;Fish Heads&quot;), Ogden Edsl (&quot;Dead Puppies&quot;, &quot;Kinko The Clown&quot;, &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Money&quot;, &quot;Idi Amin Meets Eydie Gormé&quot;), Larry &quot;Wild Man&quot; Fischer (&quot;My Name Is Larry&quot;), Larry Groce (&quot;Junk Food Junkie&quot;, 1975) and Elmo and Patsy (&quot;Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer&quot;, 1979). The show helped revive and maintain interest in novelty hits from the 1950s and 1960s that received scant airplay on mainstream pop or oldies radio stations, including &quot;Alley Oop&quot; by The Hollywood Argyles, &quot;The Ballad of Irving&quot; by Frank Gallop, &quot;The Battle of Kookamonga&quot; by Homer and Jethro, &quot;Monster Mash&quot; by Bobby &quot;Boris&quot; Pickett, &quot;Hello Muddah, Hello Faddah (A Letter from Camp)&quot; by Allan Sherman, &quot;I Want My Baby Back&quot; by Jimmy Cross, and &quot;They&#x27;re Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!&quot; by Napoleon XIV. Hansen also revived interest in the double entendre songs of 1940s Borscht Belt comedian Benny Bell, especially Bell&#x27;s signature tune, &quot;Shaving Cream&quot;. He introduced a new generation to the manic big-band parodies of Spike Jones, the musical black humor of Tom Lehrer, and the many novelty records recorded by satirist Stan Freberg in the 1950s.

Another frequently featured artist was Frank Zappa, whom Hansen cited as a major influence on the show and who appeared several times as a guest. The tribute show following Zappa&#x27;s 1993 death was the first time the entire two-hour show was devoted to a single artist.

Another of the show&#x27;s highlights occurred in the late 1980s when the satire/parody/improv hard rock trio Spinal Tap came in for a visit. Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer appeared in full costume and stayed in character for a three-hour visit. Similar &quot;big moments&quot; occurred in a visit from Screamin&#x27; Jay Hawkins (&quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot;), when the singer appeared in the studios in Culver City dressed in black cape, distributing explosive flash paper to great effect, and when Mel Brooks came in for an interview and was presented with an &quot;absolutely HUGE&quot; cheesecake from Canter&#x27;s Deli on Fairfax Avenue.

Dr. Demento was parodied in an episode of &quot;Mr. Show with Bob and David&quot; as &quot;Dr. Retarded: Novelty Record Collector and Chief Head of Surgery, Mass General&quot; and is featured as an expert in songs about &quot;paranormal monster parties&quot;.

Rainn Wilson plays Dr. Demento in the satirical biopic &quot;&quot;.

<text>The xiphoid process (), also referred to as the ensiform process, xiphisternum, or metasternum, constitutes a small cartilaginous process (extension) located in the inferior segment of the sternum, typically ossified in adult humans. Both the Greek-derived term &quot;xiphoid&quot; and its Latin equivalent, &quot;ensiform&quot;, connote a &quot;swordlike&quot; or &quot;sword-shaped&quot; morphology.

==Structure==
The xiphoid process is anatomically situated at the level of the 9th thoracic vertebra (T9) and corresponds to the T7 dermatome.

===Development===
In neonates and young infants, particularly smaller infants, the tip of the xiphoid process may be seen as a palpable lump situated just below the sternal notch. Between the ages of 15 and 29, the xiphoid process typically undergoes fusion with the body of the sternum through a fibrous joint. Unlike the synovial articulation of major joints, this joint does not permit movement. Ossification of the xiphoid process typically occurs around the age of 40.

===Variation===
The xiphoid process may exhibit natural or, in some instances, perforation (referred to as a xiphoidal foramen). These morphological variations are hereditary, which can facilitate the categorization of family members when addressing burial remains. These morphological differences carry no health implications; they simply represent variances in form.

===Other animals===
In birds, the xiphoid process is an elongated structure, often following the direction of the keel.

==Function==
Similar to how the first seven ribs articulate with the sternum, the cartilage within the celiac plexus attaches to the xiphoid process, reinforcing it, and indirectly connecting the costal cartilage to the sternum. The xiphoid process plays a role in the attachment of many muscles, including the abdominal diaphragm, a muscle necessary for normal breathing. Additionally, it serves as an attachment point for the rectus abdominis muscles, commonly known as the &quot;abs.&quot;

==Clinical significance==
During chest compressions in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), it is possible to fracture or dislodge the xiphoid process, potentially leading to punctures or lacerations of the diaphragm. Furthermore, inadvertent liver puncture resulting in life-threatening internal bleeding can occur.

Xiphoidalgia (xiphodynia) represents a distinctive syndrome characterized by sternum-related pain and tenderness. While some sources categorize this disorder as uncommon, others suggest it may be relatively prevalent but overlooked by medical professionals. Xiphoidalgia is a musculoskeletal ailment capable of producing an array of symptoms that may mimic various common abdominal and thoracic disorders and diseases.

Symptoms associated with xiphoidalgia may include abdominal pain, chest discomfort, nausea, and radiating pain extending to the back, neck, and shoulders. Activities such as lifting heavy objects or chest trauma may precipitate this musculoskeletal ailment, and symptoms may intensify with bending or twisting. Common therapeutic approaches include anesthetic and steroid injections. The earliest documented case dates back to 1712.

Beyond age 40, individuals may become aware of their partially ossified xiphoid process and potentially misinterpret it as an abnormality.

In the context of pericardiocentesis, a medical procedure involving the aspiration of fluid from the pericardium of the heart, the xiphoid process often serves as an anatomical landmark for guiding the procedure.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;xiphoid&quot; originates from the Greek word &quot;xiphos&quot;, which means &#x27;straight sword&#x27;, bearing a resemblance to the process&#x27;s tip. The Latin equivalent, &quot;processus xiphoides&quot;, translates to the xiphoid process. The writings of the Greek physician Galen refer to &quot;Os xyphoides&quot;, a translation of the Greek phrase ξιφοειδές ὀστοῦν. In this context, &quot;os&quot; in Classical Latin and ὀστοῦν in Ancient Greek both denote &#x27;bone&#x27;, while ξιφοειδές signifies &#x27;sword-shaped&#x27;.

<text>USS &quot;Long Beach&quot; (CLGN-160/CGN-160/CGN-9) was a nuclear-powered guided missile cruiser in the United States Navy and the world&#x27;s first nuclear-powered surface combatant. She was the third Navy ship named after the city of Long Beach, California.

She was the sole member of the &quot;Long Beach&quot; class, and the last cruiser built for the United States Navy to a cruiser design; all subsequent cruiser classes were built on scaled-up destroyer hulls (and originally classified as destroyer leaders) or, in the case of the , converted from already existing cruisers.

&quot;Long Beach&quot; was laid down 2 December 1957, launched 14 July 1959 and commissioned 9 September 1961 under the command of then-Captain Eugene Parks Wilkinson, who previously served as the first commanding officer of the world&#x27;s first nuclear-powered vessel, the submarine . She was deployed to Vietnam during the Vietnam War and served numerous times in the Western Pacific, Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf. But by the 1990s, nuclear power was deemed too expensive to use on surface ships smaller than an aircraft carrier in view of defense budget cutbacks after the end of the Cold War. &quot;Long Beach&quot; was decommissioned on 1 May 1995 instead of receiving her third nuclear refueling and proposed upgrade. After removal of the nuclear fuel, superstructure, and sections of the bow and stern, the hull segment containing the reactor and machinery spaces was moored at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and sold for scrap.

== Configuration ==

&quot;Long Beach&quot; was originally intended to be a smaller frigate, but was then redesigned and expanded to a cruiser hull, allowing for an open space just aft of the bridge &quot;box&quot;. This open space was first planned to accommodate the mounting of a Regulus nuclear-armed cruise missile, but was then changed to four launch tubes for the Polaris missile. However, the space was eventually occupied by the 5-inch/38-caliber gun mounts and the ASROC system. &quot;Long Beach&quot; was the last cruiser built with a World War II-era cruiser hull style, as later new-build cruisers were built with different hull forms, such as the converted frigates , , , , and the and classes, or the that was built on a hull.

The high box-like superstructure contained the SCANFAR system, consisting of the AN/SPS-32 and AN/SPS-33 phased array radars. One of the reasons &quot;Long Beach&quot; was a single-ship class was because she was an experimental platform for these radars, which were precursors to the AN/SPY-1 phased array systems later installed on Aegis equipped &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class cruisers and s. The taller, narrower AN/SPS-33 panels were not installed on the superstructure until some time after her commissioning. At the time, &quot;Long Beach&quot; had the highest bridge of any ship smaller than an aircraft carrier.

In addition to steel, &quot;Long Beach&quot; was built with 450 tons of structural aluminum. Because of this unusually high quantity of aluminum, she was assigned the voice radio call sign &quot;Alcoa&quot;. The ship was propelled by two nuclear reactors, one for each propeller shaft, and was capable of speeds in excess of . The ship was originally designed with &quot;all-missile&quot; armament, but was fitted with two 5-inch/38-caliber gun mounts amidships on the orders of President John F. Kennedy.

== Weapons suite ==

The original weapons suite consisted of:
* One rear Mk 12 launcher for the Talos long range surface-to-air missiles (SAM) with a range in excess of .
* Two forward Mk 10 launchers for the Terrier medium range SAMs with a range in excess of 30 miles (48 km).
* RUR-5 ASROC anti-submarine system capable of delivering a torpedo or depth charge at a range of .
* Two triple 12.75-inch torpedo launchers that could fire the Mark 46 torpedo.
* Two 5-inch/38-caliber guns, capable of surface and shore bombardment to a range of .

The ship went through several modifications by the time she was decommissioned. The final weapons suite consisted of:
* Two Mk-10 launchers for the Standard extended range missiles. These replaced the Terrier missiles.
* The rear launcher for the Talos was removed and initially replaced with two quadruple mounts for the RGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missile.
* Two Phalanx CIWS were added on the aft side of the aft mast.
* Two quadruple armored box launchers were added for the BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missile. These were installed aft on the fantail, with the Harpoon launchers relocated to the aft mast.

The 5-inch/38 guns and the ASROC were retained, and several 12.7 mm (50-cal) were installed as needed.

== History ==

&quot;Long Beach&quot; was originally ordered as CLGN-160. She was reclassified CGN-160 in early 1957, but was again reclassified as CGN-9 on 1 July 1957. Her keel was laid down on 2 December 1957 by Bethlehem Steel Co., Fore River Shipyard, Quincy, Massachusetts. She was launched 14 July 1959, sponsored by Mrs. Marian Swanson-Hosmer, the wife of Rear Admiral Craig Hosmer (USNR, Ret.), a Congressman from California, and commissioned on 9 September 1961. At commissioning, the ship was reported to have cost $320 million ($ today), which was over budget from earlier estimates of $250 million.

During construction in January 1960, it was widely reported that &quot;Long Beach&quot; was sabotaged when anti-mine (degaussing) electrical cables were found to have been intentionally cut in three places. It was the second of three incidents at Fore River Shipyard at that time.

&quot;Long Beach&quot; was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet and home ported at Naval Station Norfolk. The guided‑missile cruiser conducted extensive shakedown testing of her complex weapons and propulsion systems from 2 October to 16 December 1961; her performance proved the nuclear cruiser a capable warship. Between 28 December and 6 January 1962 she conducted operational tests of her missiles off Puerto Rico, then sailed for Bremerhaven, Germany, arriving 15 January for courtesy calls in north European ports.

Returning to Norfolk, Virginia 7 February 1962, &quot;Long Beach&quot;, trained off the east coast and in the Caribbean. On 10 April, she joined Atlantic Fleet as flagship for Admiral Robert L. Dennison, Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet, for exercises off the coasts of U.S. states North Carolina and Virginia. She was reviewed by President John F. Kennedy and Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson during this time.

&quot;Long Beach&quot; served in the Atlantic Fleet from her commissioning in 1961 until completing her first refueling in early 1966, when the cruiser was transferred from her home port of Norfolk to Naval Station Long Beach, California.

== Operational history ==
=== 1960s ===

After overhaul and installation of new equipment at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, &quot;Long Beach&quot; again trained in the Caribbean, and then sailed 6 August 1963 to join the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean for peacekeeping operations. She returned to Norfolk 20 December for coastal and Caribbean operations through 28 April 1964 when she sailed for the Mediterranean again to join aircraft carrier and guided missile destroyer , in the formation of the first all nuclear‑powered task group on 13 May. The force operated in the Mediterranean testing its unique capabilities until 31 July when it sailed under RADM Bernard M. Strean from Gibraltar on an around‑the‑world cruise. This operation, Sea Orbit, reminiscent of the cruise of the Great White Fleet in 1907–1909, demonstrated the strategic mobility of U.S. naval nuclear‑powered surface forces independent of normal fleet logistic support. &quot;Long Beach&quot; steamed over in 58 days at an average speed of , without being refueled or resupplied. In the course of the voyage, numerous foreign dignitaries visited the ship during visits off both coasts of Africa and in‑port calls at Karachi, Pakistan, Melbourne, Australia, Wellington, New Zealand and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

&quot;Long Beach&quot; returned to Norfolk from this cruise 3 October 1964 to join in exercises off the east coast and in the Caribbean. On 4 June 1965 she sailed for the Global Strategy Conference at the Naval War College, Newport, where Vice Admiral Kleber S. Masterson, Commander Second Fleet broke his flag on the ship. Back in Norfolk 23 June 1965, &quot;Long Beach&quot; resumed training and upkeep prior to her transfer to the Pacific Fleet. She sailed 28 February 1966 for her new home port and namesake, Long Beach, California, and arrived 15 March 1966.
Mid 1966 was spent in training and orienting midshipmen in the tactics and operations involved in the modern nuclear Navy. After a period of leave and upkeep in the fall, &quot;Long Beach&quot; sailed 7 November 1966 from Long Beach for the Far East. During this initial cruise, the ship served primarily as the Positive Identification Radar Advisory Zone (PIRAZ) unit in the northern Gulf of Tonkin. As such, her main responsibility was to &quot;sanitize&quot; returning U.S. strike aircraft, ensuring that no enemy aircraft were attempting to evade identification by hiding amongst returning friendlies. Additionally, the ship provided support for an on-board search and rescue (SAR) helicopter unit. During this tour, &quot;Long Beach&quot; was responsible for directing the downing of one Soviet-made An-2 &quot;Colt&quot; aircraft that was attempting to engage South Vietnamese naval units. The shoot-down was executed by an F-4 Phantom II under the control of a &quot;Long Beach&quot; air intercept controller. The cruiser returned to Long Beach, California, in July 1967. In 1968, the ship was redeployed to the Gulf of Tonkin, shooting down a MiG 21 jet fighter near Vinh, with a RIM-8 Talos missile on 23 May 1968, at a range of . In June of the same year, she downed another MiG, this one at . She also directed other MiG kills by American fighters. She was the first ship to down an aircraft using SAMs in the Vietnam war and the incidents were not immediately publicized. &quot;Long Beach&quot; received a Navy Unit Commendation for the actions.

=== 1970s ===
&quot;Long Beach&quot; received a Combat Action Ribbon for action on 26 April 1972, a few days after the Battle of Đồng Hới. After Vietnam, &quot;Long Beach&quot; performed routine duties in the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean, performing escort duties for USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; in 1975, and participated in multi-national naval exercises while deployed in 1976–1977. Around this time, &quot;Long Beach&quot; was identified as being suitable for conversion to accommodate the newly developed Aegis combat system, as part of the plans for a force of nuclear-powered Aegis cruisers, but that plan was not implemented. In 1975 the ship changed home ports to Naval Base San Diego, California.

=== 1980s ===

In 1980 the vessel rescued 114 Vietnamese boat people off the coast of Vietnam. 9 January 1980, &quot;Long Beach&quot; returned to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard to undergo a mid-life conversion, during which time the SCANFAR system, consisting of the AN/SPS-32 and AN/SPS-33 radars, was removed from the forward superstructure and enhanced flagship facilities were installed, along with modern radars like the AN/SPS-48. The Standard SM-2ER missiles and the associated modern electronics replaced the obsolete Terrier system. In addition, two Phalanx CIWS close-in weapon systems were installed, along with two Harpoon surface-to-surface missile (SSM) launchers on the fantail. Beginning 5 January 1985 the BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missile system was installed with two 4-cell Armored Box Launchers on the fantail, with the Harpoon launchers resited. On 19 October 1987, she participated in Kuwaiti tanker reflagging and provided anti-aircraft cover during Operation Nimble Archer. &quot;Long Beach&quot; deployed throughout the 1980s, conducting Tomahawk cruise missile test launches and exercises.

=== 1990s ===

&quot;Long Beach&quot; served as an escort for the task force, and provided aircraft carrier escort support after the Gulf War of 1991. &quot;Long Beach&quot; deployed to the region beginning 28 May 1991 to support Operation Provide Comfort, which was after Operation Desert Storm was over and major hostilities had ended in late February 1991. In June, 1991, &quot;Long Beach&quot; took part in Operation Fiery Vigil, evacuating U.S. military personnel from two bases in the Philippines, Clark Air Base and U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay, during the volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo.

== Decommissioning ==

There was originally a plan to fully upgrade &quot;Long Beach&quot; with an Aegis Combat System in the early 1990s, requiring that her superstructure be completely rebuilt. Due to cuts in the defense budget after the 1991 Gulf War, as well as the higher operating costs and number of crew required compared to conventionally powered ships, the decision was made to decommission all nuclear cruisers from the Navy as their reactor cores ran down. They would be replaced by the &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; (CG) and &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; (DDG) classes, designed from the ground up with Aegis. The &quot;Long Beach&quot; had been refueled during her 1970, 1980, and 1992 refits. The decision was made to decommission her in 1994.

A deactivation ceremony occurred on 2 July 1994 at Norfolk Naval Station, and the ship was then towed over to Newport News Shipbuilding where her entire superstructure was removed and her reactors were defueled. After this work was completed in the winter of 1995 the hull was towed through the Panama Canal to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. &quot;Long Beach&quot; was stricken on 1 May 1995, more than 33 years after she had entered service. On 13 July 2012, &quot;Long Beach&quot; was sold at auction, for recycling, as prescribed for nuclear-powered vessels by Code 350, at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington. As of May 2018, the inactivated ship&#x27;s hull and reactor compartments largely remained in long-term storage there.

A crew member aboard &quot;Long Beach&quot; may have been exposed to abnormal levels of radiation in 1963, and the ship was leaking radioactive coolant in 1991. At that time, four crew members alleged that the ship&#x27;s reactor was unsafe and that crew working around it had been exposed to unsafe levels of radiation.

<text>Saumagen (, &quot;sow&#x27;s stomach&quot;) is a German dish popular in the Palatinate. The dish is similar to a sausage in that it consists of a stuffed casing; however, the stomach itself is integral to the dish. It is not as thin as a typical sausage casing (intestines or artificial casing). Rather it is meat-like, being a strong muscular organ, and when the dish is finished by being pan-fried or roasted in the oven, it becomes crisp.

== Stuffing ==
Saumagen stuffing consists of potatoes and pork, usually spiced with onions, marjoram, nutmeg and white pepper; various recipes also mention cloves, coriander, thyme, garlic, bay leaf, cardamom, basil, caraway, allspice, and parsley. Sometimes beef is also used; a variant popular in autumn replaces some or all of the potatoes with chestnuts. The larger ingredients are diced finely. After that, the saumagen is cooked in hot water, slightly below boiling temperature to prevent rupture of the stomach. It is either served directly with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes or stored in the refrigerator for later use. To warm it again, the saumagen is cut into slices approximately , which are then fried in an open pan. The typical accompanying drink in the wine region of the Palatinate is usually a dry white wine, and in the Palatinate forest to the west, preferably a local beer.

== History ==
There is controversy regarding the origin of the dish: one theory claims that saumagen was created in the 18th century by Palatinate farmers to make use of slaughtering residues (schlachtreste). Another theory insists that saumagen has always been the highlight of each local Schlachtfest in the Palatinate region, a festival that involved the ceremonial slaughter of a pig and that is still celebrated in some wine-growing districts when the vintage is finished and when winter is near. Today the saumagen offered by German butchers and restaurants uses high-quality ingredients. Luise Wilhelmine Henninger[16] (1871–1951), cook and landlady at the Weinhaus Henninger in Kallstadt, is said to have saved the largely forgotten saumagen recipe and to have elevated it to a culinary delight, eventually. The dish lends its name to a Riesling vineyard in Kallstadt as &quot;Saumagen Kallstadt&quot;.

Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor from 1982 to 1998, loved saumagen and had it served to visiting heads of state and government, including Margaret Thatcher, Mikhail Gorbachev, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. Kohl came from the Palatinate and his enthusiasm for the very local dish brought it to a wider public. Some Germans viewed this attachment as a sign that Kohl was unsophisticated and provincial, but some saw it as a clever way of advertising his home region, as local butchers and restaurants experienced an increase of saumagen sales during and after state visits.

The Schlotte Carnival society in Schifferstadt has awarded the Order of the Saumagen since 1992. Landau hosts a Saumagen-competition, the &quot;Internationale Pfälzer Saumagen-Wettbewerb&quot;. Unique recipes include e.g. fish or deer stuffing. The first laureates, Imke Bruns and Iris Wittmann are now members of the jury.

== “Dutch goose” ==
In the Pennsylvania Dutch region of the United States, the dish, known locally as seimaage, hogmal, stuffed hog maw (&quot;maw&quot; is an old word for stomach), simply pig stomach, or “Dutch goose” (by those who are not Pennsylvania Dutch) is popular during the harvest season. Traditionally, pig stomach, not turkey, was the main course for Thanksgiving among Pennsylvania Dutch families. This tradition stems from the Old World, with the bulk of Pennsylvania Dutch settlers originating from the Palatinate. Unlike the German version, the dish is typically baked for several hours, rather than boiled.

<text>The Sloan School of Management at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (branded as MIT Sloan or Sloan) is the business school of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a private university in Cambridge, Massachusetts. MIT Sloan is a member of the M7, an informal network of business schools regarded as among the most prestigious in the United States.

MIT Sloan offers bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degree programs, as well as executive education. Many influential ideas in management and finance originated at the school, including the Black–Scholes model, the random walk hypothesis, the binomial options pricing model, and the field of system dynamics. The faculty has included numerous Nobel laureates in economics and John Bates Clark Medal winners.

==History==

The MIT Sloan School of Management began in 1914 as the engineering administration curriculum (&quot;Course 15&quot;) in the MIT Department of Economics and Statistics. The scope and depth of this educational focus grew steadily in response to advances in the theory and practice of management.

A program offering a master&#x27;s degree in management was established in 1925. The world&#x27;s first university-based mid-career education program—the Sloan Fellows program—was created in 1931 under the sponsorship of Alfred P. Sloan, himself an 1895 MIT graduate, who was the chief executive officer of General Motors and has since been credited with creating the modern corporation. An Alfred P. Sloan Foundation grant established the MIT School of Industrial Management in 1952 with the charge of educating the &quot;ideal manager&quot;. In 1964, the school was renamed in Sloan&#x27;s honor as the Alfred P. Sloan School of Management. In the following decades, the school grew to the point that in 2000, management became the second-largest undergraduate major at MIT. In 2005, an undergraduate minor in management was opened to 100 students each year. In 2014, the school celebrated 100 years of management education at MIT.

Since its founding, the school has initiated many international efforts to improve regional economies and positively shape the future of global business. In the 1960s, the school played a leading role in founding the first Indian Institute of Management. Other initiatives include the MIT-China Management Education Project, the International Faculty Fellows Program, and partnerships with IESE Business School in Spain, Sungkyunkwan University in South Korea, Universidade Nova de Lisboa in Portugal, the Skolkovo Moscow School of Management in Russia, and Tsinghua University in China. In 2014, the school launched the MIT Regional Entrepreneurship Acceleration Program (REAP), which brings leaders from developing regions to MIT for two years to improve their economies. In 2015, MIT worked in collaboration with the Central Bank of Malaysia to establish Asia School of Business in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

==Academics==

The curriculum is focused on action learning, which requires that students apply concepts learned in the classroom to real-world business settings. Courses are taught using the case method, lectures, team projects, and hands-on Action Learning Labs. The academic level of coursework is considered extremely demanding by business school standards, with a greater emphasis on analytical reasoning and quantitative analysis than most programs.

Academic rigor has a strong influence on the school&#x27;s culture. The first semester, also known as the core, is often considered the most difficult semester by design. Courses are graded using letter grades and on the standard five-point MIT scale. In its graduate programs, anything less than a 4.0 (&#x27;B&#x27;) average will result in the student not being allowed to graduate. Unlike most business schools, MIT Sloan does not offer any academic honors at graduation, consistent with the practice throughout all of MIT. The philosophy behind this is that the &#x27;honor&#x27; is in being an MIT graduate.

MIT Sloan closely collaborates with other parts of MIT, in particular the School of Engineering, the School of Science, and the Department of Economics. A special joint degree program with the School of Engineering is the Leaders for Global Operations (LGO) program, where students concurrently complete an MBA and a Master of Science in engineering. Another joint degree program aimed at students with more industry experience (an average of 8 to 10 years) is the System Design and Management (SDM) program, where students complete a Master of Science in Engineering and Management. 

Creativity and invention are constant themes at the school. The MBA track in &quot;Entrepreneurship &amp; Innovation&quot; features action learning labs which pair students with companies to learn how to solve complex problems relating to emerging technologies. These action learning labs include &quot;Entrepreneurship Lab&quot;, &quot;Innovation Teams&quot;, and &quot;Leading Sustainable Systems Lab&quot;. &quot;Global Entrepreneurship Lab&quot; and &quot;Global Health Delivery Lab&quot; send MBA students to work onsite with startups in different parts of the world. The Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship, one of the few business school entrepreneurship centers in the world focused on high tech, offers many other entrepreneurial activities and mentorship throughout the year. The annual MIT $100K Entrepreneurship Competition is one of the largest business plan competitions in the world, helping to launch more than 130 companies with a market capitalization of over $15 billion.

In a 2014 article, the school&#x27;s Dewey Library was rated the best business school library in the country. In 2016, the school&#x27;s MBA program was ranked #2 worldwide for social and environmental impact by &quot;Corporate Knights&quot; magazine.

== Global offices ==
MIT Sloan operates two global offices, the MIT Sloan Latin America Office (MSLAO) in Santiago, Chile, and the MIT Sloan Office for Southeast Asian Nations (MSAO) in Bangkok, Thailand. MSLAO opened in 2013, and MSAO is expected to open in October 2024.

==Student life==
MIT Sloan students and alumni informally call themselves &quot;Sloanies&quot;. The MIT Sloan culture is similar to, but also distinct from, overall MIT culture, and is influenced most strongly by its MBA program. MBA students come from more than 60 countries every year, with just over half coming from North America, and 60% holding US citizenship. Prior to business school, engineering is the most popular undergraduate major among students. 46% of the class is female.
A staple of MIT Sloan MBA life is the weekly &quot;C-Function&quot;, which stands for &quot;cultural function&quot; or &quot;consumption function&quot;. The school sponsors food and drink for all members of the MIT Sloan graduate community to enjoy entertainment organized by specific campus cultural groups or clubs as well as parties with non-cultural themes. C-Functions are usually held most Thursdays in the Walker Memorial building, which is also used as the venue for many other MIT Sloan community events. MIT Sloan alumni groups around the world also organize C-Functions for their club members, for social and networking activities.

Students at MIT Sloan run over 70 active clubs. Some of the most popular clubs are the &quot;Sloan Women in Management Club&quot;; the &quot;Entrepreneurship &amp; Innovation Club&quot;; the &quot;Design Club&quot;; the &quot;Finance Club&quot;; the &quot;Management Consulting Club&quot;; the &quot;Entertainment, Media and Sports Club&quot;; the &quot;Venture Capital and Private Equity Club&quot;; the &quot;Product Management Club&quot;; and the &quot;Technology Club&quot;. The &quot;Sloan Business Club&quot; is the official undergraduate business club for all MIT students.
Throughout the school year, a number of professional and academic conferences are organized by, or in partnership with, the school. Annual highlights include the MIT $100K Entrepreneurship Competition, the MIT Venture Capital &amp; Innovation Conference, the Sloan Women in Management Breaking the Mold Conference, the MIT Sloan CIO Symposium, and the MIT Sloan CFO Summit. The most visible conference—and the largest student-run conference in the world—is the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference, which &quot;Fast Company&quot; ranked the #3 most innovative sports company, behind only the NFL and MLB Advanced Media. 

Like the rest of the institute, MIT Sloan students have an extended period between semesters reserved for special activities. During the month of January, there are no formal classes at the school; instead, they are replaced by what is known as the Independent Activities Period (IAP). During IAP, students engage in activities that would be challenging to participate in alongside regular classes, often including international travel programs. In the middle of semesters, the MBA program has an additional, shorter gap, called the Sloan Innovation Period (SIP), focusing on intensive experiential leadership activities outside of the classroom.

After commencement, MIT Sloan graduates wear the MIT class ring, known as the &quot;Brass Rat&quot;. Top recruiters of new MBA graduates of the school include Apple, Google, Goldman Sachs, McKinsey &amp; Company, Nike and Amazon. The school has over 20,000 alumni globally in 90 countries, with more than 20% who are presidents or CEOs. More than 650 companies have been founded by alumni of the school, including Akamai, E*Trade, Gartner, Genentech, HubSpot, Lotus Software, Teradyne, Zipcar, and Okta.

<text>Alcohol abuse encompasses a spectrum of alcohol-related substance abuse, ranging from the consumption of more than 2 drinks per day on average for men, or more than 1 drink per day on average for women, to binge drinking or alcohol use disorder.

Alcohol abuse was a psychiatric diagnosis in the DSM-IV, but it has been merged with alcohol dependence in the DSM-5 into alcohol use disorder.

Globally, excessive alcohol consumption is the seventh leading risk factor for both death and the burden of disease and injury, representing 5.1% of the total global burden of disease and injury, measured in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). After tobacco, alcohol accounts for a higher burden of disease than any other drug. Alcohol use is a major cause of preventable liver disease worldwide, and alcoholic liver disease is the main alcohol-related chronic medical illness. Millions of people of all ages, from adolescents to the elderly, engage in unhealthy drinking. In the United States, excessive alcohol use costs more than $249 billion annually. There are many factors that play a role in causing someone to have an alcohol use disorder: genetic vulnerabilities, neurobiological precursors, psychiatric conditions, trauma, social influence, environmental factors, and even parental drinking habits.

== Definitions ==

Risky drinking (also called hazardous drinking) is defined by drinking above the recommended limits:
* greater than 14 standard drinks units per week or greater than 4 standard drinks on a single occasion in men
* greater than 7 standard drinks units per week or greater than 3 standard drinks on a single occasion in women
* any drinking in pregnant women or persons &lt; 21 years old

Binge drinking is a pattern of alcohol consumption that brings blood alcohol concentration ≥ 0.08%, usually corresponding to:
* ≥ 5 standard drinks on a single occasion in men
* ≥ 4 standard drinks on a single occasion in women

In the DSM-IV, alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence were defined as distinct disorders from 1994 to 2013. The DSM-5 combined those two disorders into alcohol use disorder with mild, moderate, and severe sub-classifications of severity. The term &quot;alcoholism&quot; is no longer a diagnosis in medical care.

Alcohol misuse is a term used by United States Preventive Services Task Force to describe a spectrum of drinking behaviors that encompass risky drinking, alcohol abuse, and alcohol dependence (similar meaning to alcohol use disorder but not a term used in DSM).

== Signs and symptoms ==
Individuals with an alcohol use disorder will often complain of difficulty with interpersonal relationships, problems at work or school, and legal problems. Additionally, people may complain of irritability and insomnia. Alcohol use disorder is also an important cause of chronic fatigue.
Signs of alcohol abuse are related to alcohol&#x27;s effects on organ systems. However, while these findings are often present, they are not necessary to make a diagnosis of alcohol abuse. Alcohol use disorder causes acute central nervous system depression which leads to inebriation, euphoria, impulsivity, sedation and poor judgment. Chronic alcohol use may lead to dependence, reckless behavior, anxiety, irritability, and insomnia.

Alcohol is hepatotoxic and chronic use leads to elevated liver enzyme levels in the bloodstream (classically the aspartate aminotransferase level is at least twice as high as the alanine transaminase level), cirrhosis, and liver failure. Cirrhosis leads to an inability to process hormones and toxins and increased estrogen levels. The skin of a patient with alcoholic cirrhosis can feature spider angiomas, palmar erythema, and — in acute liver failure — jaundice and ascites. The derangements of the endocrine system may lead to the enlargement of the male breasts. The inability to process toxic metabolites such as ammonia in alcoholic cirrhosis may lead to hepatic encephalopathy.

Alcohol is also an established carcinogen and its excessive use causes an increased risk of various cancers, such as breast cancer and head and neck cancer. Using alcohol, especially together with tobacco, is a major risk factor for head and neck cancer. 72% of head and neck cancer cases are caused by using both alcohol and tobacco. This rises to 89% when looking specifically at laryngeal cancer.

Chronic alcohol use is also associated with malnutrition, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, alcoholic cardiomyopathy, hypertension, stroke, arrhythmias, pancreatitis, depression, and dementia. Alcohol is also an established carcinogen with chronic use associated with increased risk of cancer.

Alcohol use disorder can result in brain damage which causes impairments in executive functioning such as impairments to working memory and visuospatial function. Alcohol abuse is also associated with incidence of personality disorders, affective disorders, and emotional dysregulation. Binge drinking is associated with individuals reporting fair to poor health compared to non-binge drinking individuals and which may progressively worsen over time. Alcohol also causes impairment in critical thinking, ability to handle stress, and attention. Alcoholism can cause significant impairment in social skills, due to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol on the brain, especially the prefrontal cortex area of the brain. The prefrontal cortex is responsible for cognitive functions such as working memory, impulse control, and decision making. This region of the brain is vulnerable to chronic alcohol-induced oxidative DNA damage. The social skills that can be impaired by alcohol abuse include impairments in perceiving facial emotions, difficulty with perceiving vocal emotions, theory of mind deficits, and ability to understand humor. Adolescent binge drinkers are most sensitive to damaging neurocognitive functions especially executive functions and memory. People who abuse alcohol are less likely to survive critical illness with a higher risk for having sepsis and increased risk of death during hospitalization. Cessation of alcohol use after dependence is formed may lead to alcohol withdrawal disorder and associated sequela including seizures, insomnia, anxiety, cravings, and delirium tremens.

A smaller volume of consumed alcohol has a greater impact on the older adult than it does on a younger individual. As a result, the American Geriatrics Society recommends for an older adult with no known risk factors less than one drink a day or fewer than two drinks per occasion regardless of gender.

=== Violence ===
Alcohol use disorder has a significant association with suicide and violence. Though many people with Alcohol use disorder may take alcohol to ease their mental suffering, an increased intake of alcohol may serve to further exacerbate psychological issues. This could lead to an increase in suicidal behavior. Alcohol has been implicated in up to 80 percent of suicides and 60 percent of violent acts in Native American communities.

=== Pregnancy ===
Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can pose significant risk facts, as it can harm the developing fetus. The umbilical cord is a direct pathway for the mother&#x27;s blood alcohol to reach the infant, which can result in miscarriage, and a number of lasting physical and cognitive impairments that can persist throughout the child&#x27;s life.

Among pregnant women, alcohol use disorder can result in a condition called fetal alcohol syndrome. Fetal alcohol syndrome is a pattern of physical abnormalities and impairments of mental development seen among children of alcoholic mothers. Fetal alcohol syndrome is the most common preventable cause of intellectual disability in the United States. Symptoms include a thin upper lip, short palpebral fissures, smooth philtrum, microcephaly, and other facial dysmorphic features. Surviving infants may also have structural heart defects, heart-lung fistulas, skeletal abnormalities, impaired renal development, short stature, and various cognitive disabilities. Prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with lasting deleterious effects on the endocrine, reproductive, and immune systems. Prenatal alcohol exposure is also associated with increased incidence of disease, cancer, and behavioral issues during adulthood There is no safe quantity or time period for alcohol use during pregnancy and complete abstinence is recommended. Therefore, the biological implications of alcohol abuse are also further reaching than just the physical issues experienced by the consumer.

=== Adolescence ===
Adolescence and the onset of puberty invoke significant physical, social, emotional, and cognitive changes. Increases in risk-taking, impulsivity, reward sensitivity, and social behavior lead to the emergence of alcohol use. New research is shedding light on pre-existing neurobiological markers that are predictive for the initiation of drug and alcohol abuse in adolescents. Alcohol use in adolescence is consistently associated with loss of grey matter volume, aberrant white matter development, and poor white matter integrity. A dose-dependent relationship among adolescent alcohol users is also consistently found for declines in various areas of cognition including executive function, visuospatial learning, impulsivity, working memory, attention, and language abilities. In the US, about 38% of adolescents aged 15–19 drink with 19% being classified as binge drinkers. Adolescents who drink are more likely to display symptoms of conduct disorder including disruptive behavior in school, violating social norms or the rights of others, aggression, learning disabilities, and other social impairments.

Alcohol abuse during adolescence greatly increases the risk of developing an alcohol use disorder in adulthood due to changes to neurocircuitry in the vulnerable adolescent brain. Younger ages of initial consumption among males in recent studies has shown to be associated with increased rates of alcohol abuse within the general population.

== Risk factors ==
The causes of alcohol abuse are complex and multi-faceted. Alcohol abuse is related to economic and biological origins and is associated with adverse health consequences. Peer pressure influences individuals to abuse alcohol; however, most of the influence of peers is due to inaccurate perceptions of the risks of alcohol abuse. Easy accessibility, social influence, and positive and negative reinforcement contribute to continued use. Another influencing factor among adolescents and college students are the perceptions of social norms for drinking; people will often drink more to keep up with their peers, as they believe their peers drink more than they actually do. They might also expect to drink more given the context (e.g. sporting event, house party, etc.). This perception of norms results in higher alcohol consumption than is normal.
Alcohol abuse is also associated with acculturation, because social and cultural factors such as an ethnic group&#x27;s norms and attitudes can influence alcohol abuse.

=== Mental illness ===
Alcohol consumption is often used as a temporary reprieve from states of severe anxiety, stress, or depression. Among individuals with mood disorders and anxiety disorders, the prevalence of a comorbid alcohol use disorder was significant. One study suggests that the median lifetime prevalence of alcohol use disorder in individuals with major depressive disorder was 30% across 35 US epidemiological studies. Despite this evidence, debate exists among how the relationship exists between alcohol use disorder and mood and anxiety disorders. That is, the role of alcohol use disorder as causal in depression and anxiety and alcohol use disorder as resultant have been established within the literature.

The numbing effects afforded by alcohol and other substances can serve as a coping strategy for traumatized people otherwise are unable to dissociate themselves from trauma. However, the altered or intoxicated state of the abused person prevents the full consciousness necessary for healing. Often both the alcohol misuse and psychological problems need to be treated at the same time.

=== Puberty ===
Gender differences may affect drinking patterns and the risk for developing alcohol use disorders. Sensation-seeking behaviors have been previously shown to be associated with advanced pubertal maturation, as well as the company of deviant peers. Early pubertal maturation, as indicated by advanced morphological and hormonal development, has been linked to increased alcohol usage in both male and female individuals. Additionally, when controlling for age, this association between advanced development and alcohol use still held true.

Until recently, the underlying mechanisms mediating the link between pubertal maturation and increased alcohol use in adolescence was poorly understood. Now research has suggested that sex steroid hormone levels may play a role in this interaction. When controlling for age, it was demonstrated that elevated estradiol and testosterone levels in male teenagers undergoing pubertal development was linked to increased alcohol consumption. It has been suggested that sex hormones promote alcohol consumption behaviors in teens by stimulating areas in the male adolescent brain associated with reward processing. The same associations with hormone levels were not demonstrated in females undergoing pubertal development. It is hypothesized that sex steroid hormones, such as testosterone and estradiol, are stimulating areas in the male brain that function to promote sensation-seeking and status-seeking behaviors and result in increased alcohol usage.

Additionally, the enzyme TTTAn aromatase, which functions in the male brain to convert testosterone to estradiols, has been linked to addictive and reward-seeking behaviors. Therefore, the increased activity of the enzyme may be influencing male adolescent alcohol-usage behaviors during pubertal development. The underlying mechanisms for female alcohol consumption and abuse is still under examination, but is believed to be largely influenced by morphological, rather than hormonal, changes during puberty as well as the presence of deviant peer groups.

=== Genetic Influences ===
Several research studies suggest significant genetic contributions to alcohol use disorder. According to some adoption research, biological influences were strongly related to outcomes of adoptees. Among adoptees, a stronger correlation was found between alcohol use disorder and their biological parents than their adoptive parents. Other research adds that while multiple genes may be potentially implicated, alcohol dehydrogenase 1B (ADH1B) and aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2; mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase), have been chiefly associated with excess alcohol consumption.

Nevertheless, it is important to note that alcohol use disorder entails a biopsychosocial component and genetics alone may not necessarily be causal in alcohol use disorder. There are numerous contributing risk factors which add to the complexity of alcohol including age, environment, psychiatric comorbidities and other substance use.

== Mechanisms ==

Excessive alcohol use causes neuroinflammation and leads to myelin disruptions and white matter loss. The developing adolescent brain is at increased risk of brain damage and other long-lasting alterations to the brain. Adolescents with an alcohol use disorder damage the hippocampal, prefrontal cortex, and temporal lobes. Chronic alcohol exposure can result in increased DNA damage in the brain, as well as reduced DNA repair and increased neuronal cell death. Alcohol metabolism generates genotoxic acetaldehyde and reactive oxygen species.

The brain goes through dynamic changes during adolescence as a result of advancing pubertal maturation, and alcohol can damage long- and short-term growth processes in teenagers. The rewarding effects of alcohol are attributed to dopamine, serotonin, GABA, endocannabinoids, serotonin and opioid peptides.

Alcohol is the most recreationally used drug internationally; throughout history it has played a variety of roles, from medicine to a mood enhancer. Alcoholism and alcohol abuse, however, have undergone rigorous examination as a disease which has pervasive physiological and biosocial implications. The genesis and maintenance of the disease involves the mind, body, society and culture. A common anthropological approach to understanding alcoholism is one which relates to a social factor, and this is cross-cultural studies. The description and analysis of the degree of possibilities in drinking and its results among various populations indeed constitutes one of anthropology&#x27;s major contributions to the field of alcohol studies. Understanding interactions between factors and evaluating ideas regarding how alcohol usage correlates to other cultural elements requires a number of cross-cultural comparisons. Anthropologists have analyzed a large global sample of cultures examining the association between particular traits for each which relate to the cultural components of alcoholism, these include significant measures which emphasize the social system, reliance and anxiety and strength as physical and social measures. These are the primary drivers of consuming alcohol affecting individuals on a psychosocial level.

== Cultural influences ==
Individualistic cultures such as the United States or Australia are amongst some of the highest consumers of alcohol in the whole world, however this rate of consumption does not necessarily coincide with the rate of abuse as countries like Russia which are highly collectivist see the highest rates of alcohol use disorder. Research suggests that people who score highly on individualism, a trait commonly fostered by the culture, report a lower rate of alcohol abuse and alcohol related disorders so much so that the association was negative, however a higher average consumption of alcohol per week. It is implied that individuals will drink more in a given setting, or on average because they are less receptive towards negative social attitudes surrounding excessive consumption. This however acts on another component, by where individualism protects from maladaptive consumption by lowering the need to drink socially. The final axis by which individualism protects from abusive consumption is that it promotes higher degrees of individualization and achievement values which promote personally suited rewards, this allow the individual to be more cognizant of potential alcohol abuse, and therefore protect from damaging mentalities in those who already identify as drinkers.

Alcohol use disorder also has a variety of biosocial implications, such as the physiologically effects of a detox, how the detox period interacts with ones social life and how these interactions can make overcoming addiction a complex, difficult process. Alcohol use disorder can lead to a number of physical issues and may even create a mental health condition, leading to a double classification for the alcoholic. The stress, the social perceptions of these issues may reinforce abusive drinking habits.

== Diagnosis ==
=== DSM-IV ===
Alcohol abuse was defined in the DSM-IV as a maladaptive pattern of drinking. For its diagnosis, at least one of the following criteria had to be fulfilled in the last 12 months:
* Recurrent use of alcohol resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home
* Recurrent alcohol use in situations in which it is physically hazardous
* Recurrent alcohol-related legal problems
* Continued alcohol use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of alcohol 

=== DSM-5 ===
The alcohol abuse diagnosis is no longer used in the DSM-5 (released in 2013), it is now part of the alcohol use disorder diagnosis. Of the four alcohol abuse criteria, all except the one referring to alcohol-related legal problems are included in the alcohol use disorder criteria.

=== Screening ===

The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) is considered the most accurate alcohol screening tool for identifying potential alcohol misuse, including dependence. It was developed by the World Health Organisation, designed initially for use in primary healthcare settings with supporting guidance.

== Prevention ==
Preventing or reducing the harm has been called for via increased taxation of alcohol, stricter regulation of alcohol advertising, and the provision of brief Interventions. Brief Interventions for alcohol abuse reduce the incidence of unsafe sex, sexual violence, unplanned pregnancy, and, likely, STD transmission. Information and education on social norms and the harms associated with alcohol abuse delivered via the internet or face-to-face has not been found to result in any meaningful benefit in changing harmful drinking behaviours in young people.

According to European law, individuals who are suffering from alcohol abuse or other related problems cannot be given a driver&#x27;s license, or if in possession of a license cannot get it renewed. This is a way to prevent individuals driving under the influence of alcohol, but does not prevent alcohol abuse per se.

An individual&#x27;s need for alcohol can depend on their family&#x27;s alcohol use history. For instance, if it is discovered that their family history with alcohol has a strong pattern, there might be a need for education to be set in place to reduce the likelihood of reoccurrence (Powers, 2007). However, studies have established that those with alcohol abuse tend to have family members who try to provide help. On many of these occasions, the family members would try to help the individual to change or to help improve the individual&#x27;s lifestyle.

== Social stigma ==
Several research studies suggest that stigmatization of substance use disorder is partially rooted in the belief that addiction is not a chronic illness but rather a conscious decision indicative of poor self-control or lacking restraint. Necessarily, public and internalized stigma surrounding alcoholism can have widespread effects. In an epidemiological survey of individuals with reported alcohol use disorder, the desire to both initiate and complete treatment were severely impacted by the stigma of substance use disorder. Participants conveyed fears pertaining to social rejection and discrimination, job loss, and potential legal consequences.

Men&#x27;s issues with alcohol are shockingly common, yet societal norms often downplay the severity of this problem. Prevailing cultural images of men as stoic figures who can handle their alcohol perpetuate the dangerous myth that excessive drinking is a sign of strength. However, the reality is far from this stereotype, as men face unique challenges contributing to their struggles with alcohol, such as societal expectations, workplace pressures, and traditional notions of masculinity that discourage vulnerability.

A major barrier to seeking treatment for those struggling with alcohol abuse is the stigma associated with alcohol abuse itself. Those who struggle with alcohol abuse are less likely to utilize substance (or alcohol) abuse treatment services when they perceived higher stigma with alcohol abuse. Additionally, study participants described the physical act of initiating treatment as substantiation of problematic drinking. Others attempted to avoid treatment and subsequent stigmatization by adjusting drinking behaviors to what they believed to be less maladaptive. Modifications included limiting excessive drinking to non-school or workdays, avoiding alcohol consumption before 5PM, or limiting use to weekends. stigmatization of individuals who abuse alcohol has been linked to increased levels of depression, increased levels of anxiety, decreased levels of self-esteem, and poor sleeping habits. While negative thoughts and views around the subject of alcohol abuse can keep those struggling with this issue from seeking the treatment they need, there have been several things that have been found to reduce this stigma. Social support can be an effective tool for counteracting the harmful effects of stigma and shame on those struggling with alcohol abuse. Social support can help push those struggling with alcohol abuse to overcome the negative connotation associated with their struggle and finally seek the treatment that they need.

== Treatment ==

=== Rehabilitation ===

* Outpatient: Patients may live at home while in treatment and schedule therapy as needed. This allows patients the ability to work, attend school, and attend to activities of daily living as they normally would.
* Intensive Outpatient: Allows patients who do not require regular supervision to attend weekly therapy and is less intensive than PHPs.
* Partial Hospitalization Program: Allows patients who require regular supervision and need further detoxification to attend frequent therapy. While services are outpatient, sessions may occur up to 5 days per week and up to 8hrs per day.
* Residential: Available as short-term or long-term. Residential treatment offers 24-hour rehabilitation and care. Patients receive supervised and structured therapy focusing on how to manage their alcohol use disorder in a day to day living situation, learning how to interact with the world without the use of substances.

=== Pharmacotherapy ===

* Naltrexone: Naltrexone is a prescribed opioid receptor antagonist which reduces both the cravings and the rewarding effects associated with alcohol consumption. Because patients may experience an overall reduction of alcohol consumption (reduced drinks per day, extended time between drinking days), it may allow some patients to moderate their alcohol use. As Naltrexone will precipitate withdrawal in patients with opioid dependence, patients should be detoxified from opioids.
* Acamprosate: Though the mechanism of action is unclear, it is thought that Acamprosate modulates glutamate transmission. By modifying transmission along GABA and glutamine pathways, patients may experience decreased rewarding effects associated with alcohol intake and decreased withdrawal cravings.
* Disulfiram: Disulfiram is a prescribed medication which acts as an Aldehyde Dehydrogenase inhibitor, resulting in the accumulation of acetaldehyde. When Alcohol is consumed following Disulfiram, acetaldehyde builds up leading to unpleasant physiological effects (tachycardia, flushing, headache, nausea, and vomiting). Further, the severity of the reaction is dependent on the amount of alcohol consumed. Because of this physical discomfort, Disulfiram functions as a psychological deterrent and can be effective for highly motivated, abstinent patients under supervised settings. Notably, due its distressing effects with continued alcohol consumption, medication adherence can be difficult. 
* Topiramate: Topiramate is an anticonvulsant approved for the management of epileptic seizures and used off label in the treatment of alcohol use disorder. It modulates GABA neurotransmission, and inhibits glutamate receptors, reducing cravings for alcohol and alcohol use.
* Gabapentin: Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant approved for the management of epileptic seizures and neuropathic pain and used off label in the treatment of alcohol use disorder. It modulates GABA synthesis, reducing cravings for alcohol and alcohol use.

=== Therapy Based Treatment ===

* Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): Patient and therapist set an agenda, review homework, and challenge cognitive distortions. The patients learn how their feelings and behavior are influenced by their thoughts. It can help patients manage the urge to drink using a problem-solving based approach.
* Motivational Interviewing (MI): Focuses on strengthening personal motivations for change. Patients discuss the need to alter their behavior and the reasons underlying their desire to do so.
* Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET): MET is a version of MI that focuses specifically on patients struggling with alcohol and/or substance use. It is organized based on interventions designed changing patterns of alcohol consumption summarized as FRAMES: Feedback, Responsibility, Advice, Menu, Empathy, Self-Efficacy
* Mindfulness: Mindfulness-based intervention programs (that encourage people to be aware of their own experiences in the present moment and of emotions that arise from thoughts) can reduce the consumption of alcohol.

=== Peer Support Groups ===

* Alcoholics Anonymous
* Al-Anon
* 12 step programs
* SMART Recovery

== Prognosis ==
Alcohol abuse during adolescence, especially early adolescence (i.e. before age 15), may lead to long-term changes in the brain which leaves them at increased risk of alcoholism in later years; genetic factors also influence age of onset of alcohol abuse and risk of alcoholism. For example, about 40 percent of those who begin drinking alcohol before age 15 develop alcohol dependence in later life, whereas only 10 percent of those who did not begin drinking until 20 years or older developed an alcohol problem in later life. It is not entirely clear whether this association is causal, and some researchers have been known to disagree with this view.

Alcohol use disorders often cause a wide range of cognitive impairments that result in significant impairment of the affected individual. If alcohol-induced neurotoxicity has occurred a period of abstinence for on average a year is required for the cognitive deficits of alcohol abuse to reverse.

College/university students who are heavy binge drinkers (three or more times in the past two weeks) are 19 times more likely to be diagnosed with alcohol dependence, and 13 times more likely to be diagnosed with alcohol abuse compared to non-heavy episodic drinkers, though the direction of causality remains unclear. Occasional binge drinkers (one or two times in the past two weeks), were found to be four times more likely to be diagnosed with alcohol abuse or dependence compared to non-heavy episodic drinkers.

== Epidemiology ==
Alcohol abuse is said to be most common in people aged between 15 and 24 years, according to Moreira 2009. However, this particular study of 7275 college students in England collected no comparative data from other age groups or countries.

Causes of alcohol abuse are complex and are likely the combination of many factors, from coping with stress to childhood development. The US Department of Health &amp; Human Services identifies several factors influencing adolescent alcohol use, such as risk-taking, expectancies, sensitivity and tolerance, personality and psychiatric comorbidity, hereditary factors, and environmental aspects.

Studies show that child maltreatment such as neglect, physical, and/or sexual abuse, as well as having parents with alcohol abuse problems, increases the likelihood of that child developing alcohol use disorders later in life. According to Shin, Edwards, Heeren, &amp; Amodeo (2009), underage drinking is more prevalent among teens that experienced multiple types of childhood maltreatment regardless of parental alcohol abuse, putting them at a greater risk for alcohol use disorders. Genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of alcohol use disorders, depending on age. The influence of genetic risk factors in developing alcohol use disorders increase with age ranging from 28% in adolescence and 58% in adults.

== Societal and economic costs ==
Alcohol abuse is associated with many accidents, fights, and offences, including criminal. Alcohol is responsible in the world for 2.6 million deaths and results in disability in approximately 115.9 million people. Approximately 40 percent of the 115.9 million people disabled through alcohol abuse are disabled due to alcohol-related neuropsychiatric disorders. Alcohol abuse is highly associated with adolescent suicide. Adolescents who abuse alcohol are 17 times more likely to commit suicide than adolescents who don&#x27;t drink. Additionally, alcohol abuse increases the risk of individuals either experiencing or perpetrating sexual violence. Alcohol availability and consumption rates and alcohol rates are positively associated with violent crimes, through specifics differ between particular countries and cultures.

=== By country ===
According to studies of present and former alcoholic drinkers in Canada, 20% of them are aware that their drinking has negatively impacted their lives in various vital areas including finances, work and relationships.

Problems caused by alcohol abuse in Ireland cost about 3.7 billion euro in 2007. The last cost analysis of the financial burden of alcohol-related harm was carried out in 2014 and amounted to around €2.35 billion. The OECD estimates that the annual damage is now between 9.6 and 12 billion euros. 

In South Africa, where HIV infection is epidemic, alcohol abusers expose themselves to an increased risk of this infection due to displaying more sexually risky behaviour after drinking. This kind of behaviour includes not using protection, taking part in transactional sex, and/or having multiple sexual partners.

The introduction of alcopops, sweet and pleasantly flavoured alcoholic drinks, was responsible for half of the increase in alcohol abuse in 15- and 16-year-olds, according to one survey in Sweden. In the case of girls, the alcopops, which disguise the taste of alcohol, were responsible for two thirds of the increase. The introduction of alcopops to Sweden was a result of Sweden joining the European Union and adopting the entire European Union law.

Alcohol misuse costs the United Kingdom&#x27;s National Health Service £3 billion per year. The cost to employers is 6.4 billion pounds sterling per year. These figures do not include the crime and social problems associated with alcohol misuse. The number of women regularly drinking alcohol has almost caught up with men. According to the Institute of Alcohol Studies in 2024, the annual cost of alcohol harm to society in England is £27.44 billion.

In the United States, many people are arrested for drinking and driving. Also, people under the influence of alcohol commit a large portion of various violent crimes, including child abuse and homicide. They also commit a large portion of acts of suicide. In addition, people of minority groups are affected by alcohol-related problems disproportionately, with the exception of Asian Americans. According to criminologist Hung-En Sung &quot;alcohol is the most widely abused psychoactive substance in the United States&quot;.

Alice was born around 1348. No birth record remains, but it seems that Perrers was the surname of her first husband. Her ancestry has been the topic of much speculation, which is detailed below. Around 1360, at the age of 12, she married Janyn Perrers, a jeweler who died around 1364.
=== Life at the royal court ===
Perrers became a part of the household of Queen Philippa (1310/1315–1369) as a &quot;domicella&quot; (&quot;damsel&quot;) before 1359. She became the mistress of the king, Edward III (1312–1377) around 1366, when she was around 18 years old and the King 55. During the Queen&#x27;s life, they had three children together. Three years after their relationship started, the Queen died, which devastated the 
King, causing him to lean more on Perrers. This resulted in her receiving more, mostly negative, attention from the court.

Perriers exploited Edward&#x27;s growing senility and convinced him to buy her the same jewels over and over again, which she would then turn in for more cash. She amassed a fortune of more than £20,000, by doing so, which would be worth around £6,000,000 as of 2016. She was paraded around London in golden garments as the &quot;Lady of the Sun&quot; at the King&#x27;s command, causing a wave of public criticism.

Perrer&#x27;s power further grew between 1370 and 1376. She reportedly provoked fear, and no one dared to sue her. She was seen as an ambitious, calculating, cold-hearted opportunist who manipulated the elderly King. Towards the end of Edward III&#x27;s life, Perrers was even accused of making his life miserable, and it is reported that she even stole the rings off his fingers after the King died. 

As the King&#x27;s health was ailing, Perrers contracted a secret marriage in November 1375, at the age of 27, with 53-year-old Sir William de Windsor, Baron Windsor (circa 1325–1384) to ensure her safety and livelihood after Edward&#x27;s death. He was the King&#x27;s lieutenant in Ireland. De Windsor spent long periods of time away from England, thus making it less probable that the King would discover the marriage. The couple remained together until the death of the husband on 15 September 1384, but had no children.

=== Exile ===
In 1376, an ordinance aimed specifically at Perrers set penalties for women who practiced &quot;maintenance&quot;, interfering in the due process of the law. A contemporary description of the ordinance is as follows:

Because a complaint was made to the king that some women have pursued various business and disputes in the king&#x27;s courts by way of maintenance, bribing and influencing the parties, which thing displeases the king; the king forbids any woman to do it, and especially Alice Perrers, on penalty of whatever the said Perrers can forfeit and of being banished from the realm.

Perrers was tried for corruption and subsequently exiled from England by the Good Parliament, her lands forfeit. In May 1379, the royal treasurer Thomas Brantingham delivered 21,868 pearls confiscated from Alice Perrers to the royal wardrobe. She was later able to return and regain some of her lands, but she would spend the rest of her life trying to get everything back.
=== Death ===
Perrers died during the winter of 1400/1401, aged around 52, and was buried in the Church of St Laurence in Upminster.

== Lands ==
At the height of her power, Perrers possessed 56 manors, castles and town houses in over 25 counties of England, only 15 of which were gifts from the king. These properties included Playford Hall in Suffolk, and the manor of Gaynes in Upminster, Essex. When property disputes arose with the abbot of St. Albans in 1374, Perrers, with the King&#x27;s authority behind her, sat in the court to intimidate the judges and ensured that the abbot abandoned his claim.

==Influence on literature==
Perrers is thought to have served as the prototype for Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s Wife of Bath in &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;. She was also a major patron of Chaucer. Her influence on literature may also have extended to William Langland&#x27;s Lady Mede in &quot;Piers Plowman&quot;. Langland describes Lady Meed wearing rings of purest &quot;perreize&quot;, a word for precious stones possibly chosen to play on the surname Perrers.

== Ancestry ==
As no birth record of Alice Perrers remains, many unfounded theories have arisen about her parentage. The earliest tradition spoke of a lowly birth, either as a niece of William of Wykeham (1320/1324–1404), Bishop of Winchester and Lord Chancellor, or as the daughter of a weaver from Devon. According to contemporary chronicler Thomas Walsingham, she was &quot;from the town of Henny&quot; and &quot;of low birth&quot; as the daughter of a thatcher. Walsingham&#x27;s account is often questioned because of his open hostility against the royal court and especially Perrers. Other evidence suggests that her birth surname was Salisbury and that she had at least one brother, John.

Later traditions established a higher birth for her: it has been suggested that she was the daughter of John Perrers of Holt and wife of Sir Thomas of Narford, or the illegitimate daughter of an Earl of Warenne (most likely Richard Fitzalan, 1346–1397) by a member of the Narford family. Haldeen Braddy has argued that she was the second wife of William Chaumpaigne of London and stepmother of Cecilia Chaumpaigne, the woman in whose kidnapping or rape Geoffrey Chaucer might have played a role, but this has already been disproven by Martha Powell Harley. According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica,&quot; she probably belonged to the Hertfordshire family of Perrers. This would likely make her the daughter of Sir Richard Perrers.
== Issue ==
Perrers had three illegitimate children with King Edward III during the lifetime of Queen Philippa, thus between 1366 (when their relationship started) and 1369 (the queen&#x27;s death):

* Sir John de Southeray (circa 1364 – 1383), who married Maud Percy, daughter of Henry Percy, 3rd Baron Percy and had no issue;
* Jane, (born circa 1365), who married Richard Northland;
* Joan (circa 1366 – before January 1431), who married Robert Skerne, a lawyer and member of parliament.

From her marriage to William de Windsor, she had no children.

==In fiction==
Candace Robb features Alice Perrers in her Medieval Mysteries series and Perrers is the main protagonist in Robb&#x27;s &quot;The King&#x27;s Mistress&quot; written as Emma Campion. She appears in Anya Seton&#x27;s 1954 novel &quot;Katherine&quot;. Alice Perrers is the main character in Vanora Bennett&#x27;s 2010 novel &quot;The People&#x27;s Queen&quot;. She is a character in Jean Plaidy&#x27;s &quot;Vow on the Heron&quot;. She is portrayed in Rebecca Gablé&#x27;s &quot;Das Lächeln der Fortuna&quot;, a historical novel in the German language about the time-period. She is the protagonist of the 2012 novel &quot;The King&#x27;s Concubine&quot; by Anne O&#x27;Brien. She also appears in &quot;The Traitor&#x27;s Noose&quot;, the fourth novel in the &quot;Lions and Lilies&quot; series by Catherine A. Wilson and Catherine T. Wilson.

<doc id="232005" wikidata="Q2607934" url="?curid=232005" title="Guided-missile destroyer">
<text>A guided-missile destroyer (DDG) is a destroyer whose primary armament is guided missiles so they can provide anti-aircraft warfare screening for the fleet. The NATO standard designation for these vessels is DDG, while destroyers which have a primary gun armament or a small number of anti-aircraft missiles sufficient only for point-defense are designated DD. Nations vary in their use of destroyer D designation in their hull pennant numbering, either prefixing or dropping it altogether.

Guided-missile destroyers are equipped with large missile magazines, with modern examples typically having vertical-launch cells. Some contain integrated weapons systems, such as the United States’ Aegis Combat System, and may be adopted for use in an anti-missile or ballistic-missile defense role. This is especially true for navies that no longer operate cruisers, so other vessels must be adopted to fill in the gap.

Many guided-missile destroyers are also multipurpose vessels, equipped to carry out anti-surface operations with surface-to-surface missiles and naval guns, and anti-submarine warfare with torpedoes and helicopters.

<doc id="232009" wikidata="Q16836" url="?curid=232009" title="Leon Lai">
<text>Leon Lai Ming (; born 11 December 1966), is a Hong Kong actor, singer, film director, and businessman. He is one of the &quot;Four Heavenly Kings&quot; of Hong Kong pop music. He uses his Chinese name &quot;Lai Ming&quot; or &quot;Li Ming&quot;, which literally means &quot;dawn&quot;.

==Early life==
Lai was born in Beijing, China. He is of Hakka ancestry, his family was originally from Meixian. He migrated with his parents to Hong Kong at the age of four. At the age of 15, he attended Christ College in the United Kingdom, but returned to Hong Kong at 18 in 1984.

==Career==
===Early years===
Lai initially worked as a salesperson for a mobile phone company. After being awarded second-runner-up in the 1986 New Talent Singing Awards, Lai received vocal coaching from Dai Si Zong (). In the same year he signed with Capital Artists. He did not release any albums for four years. As a result, his teacher, Dai, arranged to have him signed a contract with Polygram, later known as Universal Music.

===Music===
In Polygram, he released his first album &quot;Leon&quot; and subsequent album &quot;Meet in the Rain&quot;. His debut album went gold.

In the early stages of his career, he mainly sang Cantopop and Mandarin, but due to the influence of producer Mark Lui, he expanded his repertoire to include popular electronic songs with compelling music videos. In 1990 he won his first 1990 Jade Solid Gold Top 10 Awards and 1990 RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards. He followed up to win the &quot;Most Popular Male Singer&quot; award in 1993 and 1995 for TVB Jade Solid Gold. In 1996, he collaborated with composer-producer Steve Barakatt on his album &quot;Feel&quot;. Two years later in 1998, he became the first Hong Kong singer to reach the Top 10 K-pop chart with the song &quot;After Loving You.&quot;

In 2002 he was selected to sing &quot;Charged Up&quot;, the 2002 FIFA World Cup theme song for the Greater China region. In 2004, he became the first Hong Kong singer to represent the territory at the first Asia Song Festival held in South Korea.

Lai was selected to be the ambassador of the 6th Winter Asian Games to be held Changchun in 2007. He sang the Games&#x27; theme song and took part in the torch relay. He then joined Michael Wong and Janice Vidal and held a three-day &quot;Magic Live&quot; charity concert at Star Hall, Hong Kong from 9 to 11 November 2008.

Lai holds his concert at the Hong Kong Coliseum, titled &quot;Leon Lai Talk &amp; Sing 2021 Concert&quot;, from 10 July 2021, for 9 shows.

====Duets====
Apart from being a solo artist, Lai has collaborated with other artists. Some of his better known collaborations are &quot;Love Until the End&quot; and &quot;A Happy Family&quot; with Vivian Chow, &quot;Really Wish to Be Like This Forever&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Still You&quot; with Priscilla Chan, &quot;Song of the Star&quot; with Alan Tam, &quot;Never Give Up&quot; with Jacky Cheung, &quot;Why did I let you go?&quot; with Janice Vidal.

===Company founder and singer===
In 2004, Lai formed a new record production company, &quot;A Music&quot;, East Asia Record Production Company Limited, with Peter Lam. The first album produced by the company, &quot;Dawn&quot; was released in September of that year. The album, &quot;Dawn&quot;, was released with minimum promotion as Lai went to Mainland China for a movie shoot on the day of the album&#x27;s release.

In 2005, Lai invited Taiwanese music producer Jonathan Lee to produce his new Mandarin album &quot;A Story&quot;. However, by doing so he had to give up the opportunity for a lead role in a big budget Taiwan movie &quot;Gui Si&quot; due to conflicts in his schedules.

He returned to the Hong Kong Coliseum on 13 April 2007 to perform in his one night only &quot;Leon 4 in Love Concert,&quot; where he performed not only his own hits but also hits from the other three heavenly kings. He performed a total of 18 songs, all of which are newly arranged by Mark Lui. He subsequently released an album titled &quot;4 in Love&quot; on 3 May 2007, comprising 16 of the 18 songs he had performed at the concert.

In 2004, Paciwood co-invested with Esun Group to develop a music record company, East Asia Record Production Limited, with the music label Amusic.

===Acting career===

After the New Talent Singing Awards, he had some opportunities to star in a few TV series. On one occasion, he went for the filming of a romantic serials titled, &quot;Fengyun Era&quot;, in Taiwan. There was a stark contrast in height between Lai and the popular lead actress who is only 160 cm tall. The actress then demanded that Lai squat while filming so as to make up for the height differences. Lai had to act through all the scenes with the actress while squatting, but he had to endure it as he was not popular at the time. Not long afterwards his new TVB series, &quot;The Breaking Point&quot;, turned out to be a resounding success and propelled him to widespread fame in Hong Kong and Taiwan.

In 1996, Lai was nominated for the &quot;Best Actor&quot; award at the 16th Hong Kong Film Awards for the film &quot;&quot;. The following year in 1997, he won the award of &quot;Best Original Song&quot; for the film &quot;Eighteen Springs&quot; both at the Golden Horse Film Festival and Hong Kong Film Awards. He was again nominated for the &quot;Best Actor&quot; and &quot;Best Original Film Song&quot; award for the film &quot;City of Glass&quot; (玻璃之城) in 1999, but he only won the award for the latter, which he shared with Albert Leung and Dick Lee.

Lai was considered by Lee Ang to act as &quot;Li Mu Bai&quot; in the film &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;, but he had to turn down the offer as he had an advertising contract and live concert about to start, which would not match his shaven head look as was required for the role.

He collaborated with Cecilia Cheung 張柏芝 in 2001 for the first time in the Wong Jing directed romantic comedy film, &quot;Everyday Is Valentine&quot;. In the film, Lai played a serial liar.
In 2002, Lai took the spotlight at the Golden Horse Awards, the Chinese-language version of the Oscars in Taiwan. He won &quot;Best Actor&quot; for &quot;Three: Going Home&quot;. Lai played a minor role as &quot;Superintendent Yeung Kam Wing&quot; in &quot;Infernal Affairs III&quot; in 2003. In 2004, he starred with Faye Wong 王菲 in the romantic film &quot;Leaving Me, Loving You&quot;, the story of which he co-wrote with Wilson Yip and he was also the creative/production controller of the film. However, the movie was a flop as it raked in HK$ 10,529,501 at the box office. Still in that same year he was ranked 8th on the China Celebrity 100 list released by the Chinese edition of Forbes.

In 2005 Lai acted as one of the seven warriors in the Tsui Hark directed wuxia film, &quot;Seven Swords&quot;. In the same year in the film &quot;Moonlight in Tokyo&quot;, he played a developmentally challenged Chinese man who pretends to be a Korean gigolo in Japan.

In 2006 Lai starred alongside Fan Bingbing and Rene Liu in a love and horror, thriller film titled &quot;The Matrimony&quot; where he played a cinematographer &quot;Shen Junchu&quot;, the love interest of &quot;Manli&quot; and &quot;Sansan&quot;. &quot;JunChu&quot; was pressurised into marrying &quot;Sansan&quot; after the untimely demise of his true love &quot;Manli&quot; in an accident. The film was released on 8 February 2007.

In 2007, Lai starred alongside Kelly Chen, Donnie Yen and Guo Xiaodong in the Ching Siu-tung film An Empress and the Warriors. He acted as a woodland medicine man who has a romantic relationship with a princess. Lai and Kelly Chen sang the theme song, &quot;Fly With Your Dreams&quot; written by Albert Leung and composed by Mark Lui.

He underwent training in Peking Opera for playing the lead role as &quot;Méi Lánfāng&quot; in the biographical film &quot;Forever Enthralled&quot; which was directed by Chen Kaige. He directed the music video for the film where he and Zhang Ziyi sang the theme song, &quot;You Understand My Love&quot;. For the first time in his career, Lai played the role of a beggar in the Peter Chan directed film &quot;Bodyguards and Assassins&quot;. For his success a wax figure of Lai was revealed at Madame Tussauds Hong Kong.

===Community===

Apart from being an actor and singer, Lai is actively involved in the Community Chest. In the 1990s, he began serious charity work when his father was diagnosed with rectal cancer. The doctors said it was incurable. After the surgical operation, his father survived. When the Cancer Research Foundation and the UN organization approached him for help, he started getting actively involved in charity work.

His first work with UNICEF was a China polio eradication project in 1993. He raised substantial funds accruing from his supporters, fans, and concert ticket sales. In July 1994, he was appointed the International UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, thus becoming the first Hong Kong citizen to be given this position. Since 1994, he has been involved in various fundraising activities of The Hong Kong Committee for UNICEF (HKCU). These activities include seven charity concerts, three charity chocolate sales, and charity walkathons. Lai, along with HKCU representatives, visited Rwanda, Gansu of China, and Brazil to study the work of UNICEF and to help promote public awareness to help children. In December 1995, he was appointed as &quot;UNICEF Special Representative to Youth&quot; at the New York headquarters recognizing his contributions for the welfare of the children.

Lai has also been elected as one of The Ten Outstanding Young Persons (TOYP) in 1997, giving him a formal recognition of his professional endeavors and commitment to the community. He bought the first donation ticket, numbered 000001, at a &quot;Children&#x27;s Education Fund Raising Campaign&quot; launch event at Tsuen Wan PARKnSHOP&#x27;s Skyline Superstore in 2001 to encourage people to contribute to a meaningful social cause. The funds raised were donated to the Community Chest.

He was awarded the Medal of Honour (M.H.) on 12 October 2003 by Tung Chee-Hwa, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong.

Since his decision not to receive any music award in Hong Kong, he has not appeared on the TVB Jade Gold Solid Awards ceremony even as a guest, but to secure more funds for charity, he agreed to perform in the ceremony as a guest performer on 8 January 2005. On 13 May the same year, Lai collaborated with Mark Lui to compose the song &quot;8858&quot;. The song was used as the promotional song for the China Children and Teenagers&#x27; Fund (CCTF). The title of song means &quot;Help Me (which sounds like &#x27;bang bang wo ba&#x27; in Putonghua)&quot; and the number &quot;8858&quot; represents the SMS number people can use to donate the money.

In December 2005, Lai appeared in a Hong Kong government television advertisement in support of a gradual political reform package tabled by the ruling government rather than rapid political reform. This was the first time he got himself involved in a politically motivated advertisement.

==Personal life==
In 2008, Lai secretly married model Gaile Lok in Las Vegas at the Wynn Hotel, with his manager and assistant acting as witnesses. On 3 October 2012, the couple announced the end of their four-year marriage. Their joint statement stated that there were &quot;different philosophies in life&quot; which caused the divorce.

In 2017, Lai formed a relationship with his label assistant and later sales manager Chan Wing-yee (), who is 19 years his junior and also a divorcee. On 22 April 2018, Chan gave birth to their daughter.

===Commercial anthem incident===
In 2000, Lai&#x27;s song &quot;All Day Love&quot; () got him into trouble with the Chinese authorities for drawing passages from the Chinese National Anthem, &quot;March of the Volunteers&quot;. The starting tune was accused of plagiarism from the anthem. Lai was warned against using the song for commercial purposes.

<doc id="232011" wikidata="Q448289" url="?curid=232011" title="Jacquetta of Luxembourg">
<text>Jacquetta of Luxembourg (1415/1416 – 30 May 1472) was a prominent figure in the Wars of the Roses. Through her short-lived first marriage to the Duke of Bedford, brother of King Henry V, she was firmly allied to the House of Lancaster. However, following the emphatic Lancastrian defeat at the Battle of Towton, she and her second husband Richard Woodville sided closely with the House of York. Three years after the battle and the accession of Edward IV of England, Jacquetta&#x27;s eldest daughter Elizabeth Woodville married him and became queen consort of England. Jacquetta bore Woodville 14 children and stood trial on charges of witchcraft, of which she was exonerated.

==Family and ancestry==
Jacquetta was the eldest daughter of Peter I of Luxembourg, Count of Saint-Pol, Conversano and Brienne, and his wife Margaret of Baux (Margherita del Balzo of Andria). Her father Peter of Luxembourg, Count of Saint-Pol, was also the hereditary Count of Brienne from 1397 until his death in 1433.
==First marriage==
On 22 April 1433 at age 17, Jacquetta married John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford, at Thérouanne. The Duke was the third son of King Henry IV of England and Mary de Bohun, and thus the grandson of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, himself the third son of King Edward III. The marriage was childless, and the Duke died on 15 September 1435 at Rouen. As was customary at the time, Jacquetta retained the title of her first husband after her second marriage and was always known as the Duchess of Bedford, this being a higher title than that of countess. Jacquetta inherited one-third of the Duke&#x27;s main estates as her widow&#x27;s share.

==Second marriage==
On Jacquetta&#x27;s journey to England, she was escorted by Sir Richard Woodville, who was commissioned by Henry VI of England. During the journey, Jacquetta and Richard fell in love and married in secret (before 23 March 1437), without seeking the king&#x27;s permission. Jacquetta had been granted dower lands following her first husband&#x27;s death on condition that she not remarry without a royal licence. On learning of the marriage, Henry VI refused to see them, but was mollified by the payment of a fine of £1000. The marriage was long and very fruitful: Jacquetta and Richard had fourteen children, including the future Queen consort Elizabeth Woodville. She lost her first-born son Lewis to a fever when he was 12 years old.

By the mid-1440s, the Woodvilles were in a powerful position. Jacquetta was related to both King Henry and Queen Margaret by marriage. Her sister, Isabelle de Saint Pol, married Margaret&#x27;s uncle Charles du Maine while Jacquetta was the widow of Henry VI&#x27;s uncle. She outranked all ladies at court with the exception of the queen. As a personal favourite, she also enjoyed special privileges and influence at court. Margaret influenced Henry to create her husband Baron Rivers in 1448, and he was a prominent partisan of the House of Lancaster as the Wars of the Roses began.

==Wars of the Roses==
Edward IV&#x27;s victory at Towton in 1461 allowed him to secure the English throne for himself. In 1464 he married Jacquetta&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth, who then became the Queen of England. The Woodvilles rose to great prominence and power, through Elizabeth&#x27;s influence. Jacquetta&#x27;s husband Richard was created Earl Rivers and appointed Lord High Treasurer in March 1466. Jacquetta found rich and influential spouses for her children and helped her grandchildren achieve high posts. She arranged for her 20-year-old son, John, to marry the widowed and very rich Katherine Neville, Duchess of Norfolk, who was at least 45 years older than John. The rise of the Woodvilles created widespread hostility among the Yorkists, including Warwick and the king&#x27;s brothers George and Richard, who were being displaced in the king&#x27;s favour by the former Lancastrians.

In 1469, Warwick openly broke with Edward IV and temporarily deposed him. Earl Rivers and his son John were captured and executed by Warwick on 12 August at Kenilworth. Jacquetta survived her husband by three years and died in 1472, at about 56 years of age.

==Witchcraft accusations==
Shortly after Jacquetta&#x27;s husband&#x27;s execution by Warwick in 1469, Thomas Wake, a follower of Warwick, accused her of witchcraft. Wake brought to Warwick Castle a lead figurine &quot;made like a man-of-arms ... broken in the middle and made fast with a wire,&quot; and alleged that Jacquetta had fashioned it and two others to represent the king&#x27;s family to use for witchcraft and sorcery. He claimed that the images had been found by &quot;an honest person&quot;, Harry Kyngeston of Stoke Bruerne, Northamptonshire, in his house after the departure of soldiers, who delivered it to the parish clerk John Daunger of Shutlanger (in the parish of Stoke Bruerne). Daunger could allegedly attest that Jacquetta had made the three images. The case fell apart when Warwick released Edward IV from custody, and Jacquetta was cleared by the king&#x27;s great council of the charges on 21 January 1470. In 1484, Richard III, in the act known as Titulus Regius, revived the allegations of witchcraft against the dead Jacquetta when he claimed that she and Elizabeth had procured Elizabeth&#x27;s marriage to Edward IV through witchcraft; however, Richard never offered any proof to support his assertions.

# Mary Woodville (c. 1456 – 1481), married William Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke.
# Catherine Woodville (c. 1458 – 18 May 1497), married first Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, second Jasper Tudor, Duke of Bedford, and third Sir Richard Wingfield.
The Visitation of Buckinghamshire of 1566 mentions the marriage of William Dormer of Wycombe (only later of Ascott House) to &quot;Agnes, da. of Sir Richard Woodvyle, Erle Ryvers&quot; but does not say whether the father was the first or the third earl, who the mother was or whether Agnes was legitimate.

==In fiction==
Jacquetta is a main character in Philippa Gregory&#x27;s 2009 novel &quot;The White Queen&quot;, a fictionalized account of the life of her eldest daughter Elizabeth. In the novel, Jacquetta is portrayed as having indeed dabbled quite a bit in witchcraft, displaying what would seem to be actual power. She is also the main protagonist in Gregory&#x27;s 2011 prequel novel &quot;The Lady of the Rivers&quot;. Gregory&#x27;s works explore the historical claim by Jacquetta&#x27;s family that they were descended from the water deity Melusine. Gregory uses Jacquetta&#x27;s tenuous ties to Melusine and Joan of Arc to further her potential ties to witchcraft. In the 2013 BBC One/Starz television series adaptation &quot;The White Queen&quot;, Jacquetta is portrayed by actress Janet McTeer.

Jacquetta is also an important character in Margaret Frazer&#x27;s fifth &quot;Player Joliffe&quot; novel, &quot;A Play of Treachery&quot; (2009). The story is set in 1435–6, after the death of her first husband, John, Duke of Bedford. This historical novel tells a tale regarding her marriage to Sir Richard Woodville. There is no mention of witchcraft in this novel.

Jacquetta is also a prominent character in &quot;The Last of the Barons&quot; (1843), a novel by Edward Bulwer-Lytton (1803–1873). The book&#x27;s title is a reference to Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick.

<text>Bus spotting is the interest and activity of watching, photographing and tracking buses throughout their working service lives within bus companies. A person who engages in these activities is known as a bus spotter, bus fan, bus nut (colloquial British English) or bus enthusiast.

There are many enthusiasts of the bus and coach industry across the globe. Like train and aircraft spotters, bus spotters activities include monitoring bus route allocations, sharing knowledge about buses and taking pictures of buses. Some may be so keen that they might track a vehicle through its life, knowing for example which fleet numbers it has carried with different owners and when mechanical parts or interior fittings were renewed.

Since bus spotting involves urban mass transit, it often goes hand in hand with metrophily. In New York, the two are often combined into &quot;transit fan&quot;, a person who studies both bus and rail rapid transit, with the same diligence. This practice is popular in the Greater Toronto And Hamilton Area in Canada.

There are a number of magazines aimed at bus enthusiasts and spotters, e.g. &quot;Buses Magazine&quot;.

==Preservation of buses==

Some bus spotters may list or trace the whereabouts of surviving retired vehicles from a particular operator to purchase them for preservation purposes. The preserved buses can then be taken out to be driven either on discontinued services or through a set route for an event.

<doc id="232016" wikidata="Q333220" url="?curid=232016" title="Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux">
<text>Henry Peter Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux, (; 19 September 1778 – 7 May 1868) was a British statesman who became Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain and played a prominent role in passing the Reform Act 1832 and Slavery Abolition Act 1833.

Born in Edinburgh, Brougham helped found the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; in 1802 before moving to London, where he qualified as a barrister in 1808. Elected to the House of Commons in 1810 as a Whig, he was Member of Parliament for various constituencies until becoming a peer in 1830.

Brougham won popular renown for helping defeat the 1820 Pains and Penalties Bill, an attempt by the widely disliked George IV to annul his marriage to Caroline of Brunswick. He became an advocate of liberal causes including abolition of the slave trade, free trade and parliamentary reform. Appointed Lord Chancellor in 1830, he made a number of reforms intended to speed up legal cases and established the Central Criminal Court. He never regained government office after 1834 and although he played an active role in the House of Lords, he often did so in opposition to his former colleagues.

Education was another area of interest. He helped establish the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge and University College London, as well as holding some academic posts, including Rector, University of Edinburgh. In later years he spent much of his time in the French town of Cannes, making it a popular resort for the British upper-classes; he died there in 1868.
==Life==
===Early life===

Brougham was born and grew up in Edinburgh, the eldest son of Henry Brougham (1742–1810), of Brougham Hall in Westmorland, and Eleanora, daughter of Reverend James Syme. The Broughams had been an influential Cumberland family for centuries. Brougham was educated at the Royal High School and the University of Edinburgh, where he chiefly studied natural science and mathematics, but also the law. He published several scientific papers through the Royal Society, notably on light and colours and on prisms, and at the age of only 25 was elected a Fellow. 

However, Brougham chose law as his profession and was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1800. He practised little in Scotland, and instead entered Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1803. Five years later he was called to the Bar. Not a wealthy man, Brougham turned to journalism to support himself financially through these years. He was one of the founders of the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; and quickly became known as its foremost contributor, with articles on everything from science, politics, colonial policy, literature, poetry, surgery, mathematics and the fine arts.

In the early 19th century, Brougham, a follower of Newton, launched anonymous attacks in the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; against Thomas Young&#x27;s research, which proved light was a wave phenomenon that exhibited interference and diffraction. These attacks slowed acceptance of the truth for a decade, until François Arago and Augustin-Jean Fresnel championed Young&#x27;s work.
Brougham&#x27;s scientific forays also included an attack upon Sir William Herschel (1738–1822). As Royal Astronomer, Herschel found a correlation between the observed number of sunspots and wheat prices. This met with ridicule as a &quot;grand absurdity&quot; from Lord Brougham. Economists nowadays concur with Brougham on the irrelevancy of sunspots.

===Early career===
The success of the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; made Brougham a man of the mark from his first arrival in London. He quickly became a fixture in London society and gained the friendship of Lord Grey and other leading Whig politicians. In 1806 the Foreign Secretary, Charles James Fox, appointed him secretary to a diplomatic mission to Portugal, led by James St Clair-Erskine, 2nd Earl of Rosslyn, and John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent. The mission aimed to counteract the anticipated French invasion of Portugal.

During these years he became a close supporter of the movement for the abolition of slavery, a cause to which he was to be passionately devoted for the rest of his life. Despite being a well-known and popular figure, Brougham had to wait before being offered a parliamentary seat to contest. However, in 1810 he was elected for Camelford, a rotten borough controlled by the Duke of Bedford.

He quickly gained a reputation in the House of Commons, where he was one of the most frequent speakers and was regarded by some as a potential future leader of the Whig Party. However, Brougham&#x27;s career was to take a downturn in 1812, when, standing as one of two Whig candidates for Liverpool, he was heavily defeated. He was to remain out of Parliament until 1816 when he was returned for Winchelsea. He quickly resumed his position as one of the most forceful members of the House of Commons and worked especially in advocating a programme for the education of the poor, where he chaired the select committee which produced the influential Reports on the Education of the Lower Orders.

He was also a proponent of legal reform and it was on this subject in 1828, he made a six-hour speech, the longest ever made in the House of Commons.

=== Defence of Queen Caroline ===
In 1812, Brougham had become one of the chief advisers to Queen Caroline of Brunswick, the estranged wife of George, Prince of Wales, the Prince Regent and future George IV. This was to prove a key development in his life.

In April 1820, Caroline, then living abroad, appointed Brougham her Attorney-General. Earlier that year George IV had succeeded to the throne on the death of his long incapacitated father George III. Caroline was brought back to Britain in June for appearances only, but the king immediately began divorce proceedings against her.

The Pains and Penalties Bill, aimed at dissolving the marriage and stripping Caroline of her Royal title on the grounds of adultery, was brought before the House of Lords by the Tory government. However, Brougham led a legal team (which also included Thomas Denman) that eloquently defended the Princess. Brougham threatened to introduce evidence of George IV&#x27;s affairs and his secret marriage to a Roman Catholic, which could have potentially thrown the monarchy into chaos, and it was suggested to Brougham that he hold back for the sake of his country.

He responded with his now-famous speech in the House of Lords:
The speech has since become legendary among defence lawyers for the principle of zealously advocating for one&#x27;s client.

The bill passed, but by the narrow margin of only nine votes. Lord Liverpool, aware of the unpopularity of the bill and afraid that it might be overturned in the House of Commons, then withdrew it. The British public had mainly been on the Princess&#x27;s side, and the outcome of the trial made Brougham one of the most famous men in the country. His legal practice on the Northern Circuit rose fivefold, although he had to wait until 1827 before being made a King&#x27;s Counsel.

In 1826, Brougham, along with Wellington, was one of the clients and lovers named in the notorious &quot;Memoirs of Harriette Wilson&quot;. Before publication, Wilson and publisher John Joseph Stockdale wrote to all those named in the book offering them the opportunity to be excluded from the work in exchange for a cash payment. Brougham paid and secured his anonymity.

=== Lord Chancellor ===

Brougham remained a member of Parliament for Winchelsea until February 1830 when he was returned for Knaresborough. However, he represented Knaresborough only until August the same year, when he became one of four representatives for Yorkshire. His support for the immediate abolition of slavery brought him enthusiastic support in the industrial West Riding. The Reverend Benjamin Godwin of Bradford devised and funded posters that appealed to Yorkshire voters who had supported William Wilberforce to support Brougham as a committed opponent of slavery However, Brougham was adopted as a Whig candidate by only a tiny majority at the nomination meeting: the Whig gentry objecting that he had no connection with agricultural interests, and no connection with the county. Brougham came second in the poll, behind the other Whig candidate; although the liberals of Leeds had placarded the town with claims that one of the Tory candidates supported slavery, this was strenuously denied by him.

In November the Tory government led by the Duke of Wellington fell, and the Whigs came to power under Lord Grey. Brougham joined the government as Lord Chancellor, although his opponents claimed he previously stated he would not accept office under Grey. Brougham refused the post of Attorney General, but accepted that of Lord Chancellor, which he held for four years. On 22 November, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Brougham and Vaux, of Brougham in the County of Westmorland.
The highlights of Brougham&#x27;s time in government were passing the Reform Act 1832 and Slavery Abolition Act 1833 but he was seen as dangerous, unreliable and arrogant. Charles Greville, who was Clerk of the Privy Council for 35 years, recorded his &quot;genius and eloquence&quot; was marred by &quot;unprincipled and execrable judgement&quot;. Although retained when Lord Melbourne succeeded Grey in July 1834, the administration was replaced in November by Sir Robert Peel&#x27;s Tories. When Melbourne became Prime Minister again in April 1835, he excluded Brougham, saying his conduct was one of the main reasons for the fall of the previous government; Baron Cottenham became Lord Chancellor in January 1836.

=== Later life ===
Brougham was never to hold office again. However, for more than thirty years after his fall he continued to take an active part in the judicial business of the House of Lords, and in its debates, having now turned fiercely against his former political associates, but continuing his efforts on behalf of reform of various kinds. He also devoted much of his time to writing. He had continued to contribute to the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;, the best of his writings being subsequently published as &quot;Historical Sketches of Statesmen Who Flourished in the Time of George III&quot;.

In 1834, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1837, Brougham presented a bill for public education, arguing that &quot;it cannot be doubted that some legislative effort must at length be made to remove from this country the opprobrium of having done less for the education of the people than any of the more civilized nations on earth&quot;.

In 1838, after news came up of British colonies where the emancipation of the slaves was obstructed or where the ex-slaves were being badly treated and discriminated against, Lord Brougham stated in the House of Lords:The slave ... is as fit for his freedom as any English peasant, aye, or any Lord whom I now address. I demand his rights; I demand his liberty without stint... I demand that your brother be no longer trampled upon as your slave!

Brougham was elected Rector of Marischal College for 1838. He also edited, in collaboration with Sir Charles Bell, William Paley&#x27;s &quot;Natural Theology&quot; and published a work on political philosophy and in 1838 he published an edition of his speeches in four volumes. The last of his works was his posthumous &quot;Autobiography&quot;.

In 1854, Brougham was appointed to the Royal Commission for Consolidating the Statute Law, a royal commission to consolidate existing statutes and enactments of English law.

In 1857 he was one of the founders of the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science and was its president at some congresses.

In 1860, Brougham was given by Queen Victoria a second peerage as Baron Brougham and Vaux, of Brougham in the County of Westmorland and of Highhead Castle in the County of Cumberland, with remainder to his youngest brother William Brougham (died 1886). The patent stated that the second peerage was in honour of the great services he had rendered, especially in promoting the abolition of slavery.

==Family==
Brougham was said to be the father of writer Marie Blaze de Bury. Her last name was Stuart or Stewart and she was born in Oban, Scotland in 1813. She was sent to France when she was nine where she completed her education.

Brougham married Mary Spalding (d. 1865), daughter of Thomas Eden, and widow of John Spalding, MP, in 1821. They had two daughters, both of whom predeceased their parents, the latter one dying in 1839. Lord Brougham and Vaux died in May 1868 in Cannes, France, aged 89 and was buried in the Cimetière du Grand Jas. The cemetery is up to the present dominated by Brougham&#x27;s statue, and he is honoured for his major role in building the city of Cannes. His hatchment is in Ninekirks, which was then the parish church of Brougham.

The Barony of 1830 became extinct on his death, while he was succeeded in the Barony of 1860 according to the special remainder by his younger brother William Brougham.

==Legacy==
As the designer of the brougham, a four-wheeled horse-drawn carriage that bears his name, Brougham&#x27;s patronage brought renown to the French seaside resort of Cannes. In 1835, when little more than a fishing village on a picturesque coast, Brougham purchased a tract of land and built on it, leading it to become a popular sanitorium of Europe. Owing to his influence the beachfront promenade at Nice became known as the Promenade des Anglais (literally, &quot;The Promenade of the English&quot;). The baron inspired others to winter in Cannes and own a second home there. He oversaw the construction of &#x27;Villa Elenore-Louise&#x27; which he named after his daughter, living in the villa himself. One of his friends became the riviera&#x27;s de facto estate agent owing to the building of Château Vallombrosa. The newly built villas made popular by Brougham attracted royalty, including as Queen Victoria and the Russian Czar.

A statue of Lord Brougham stands at the Cannes waterfront, across from the Palais des festivals et des congrès.

Brougham holds the House of Commons record for non-stop speaking at six hours.

Brougham was present at the trial of the world&#x27;s first steam-powered ship on 14 October 1788 at Dalswinton Loch near Auldgirth, Dumfries and Galloway. William Symington of Wanlockhead built the two-cylindered engine for Patrick Miller of Dalswinton.

Brougham Street and Brougham Place in Edinburgh are named in his memory.

Brougham Street in Christchurch, New Zealand, was also named in his honour.

==Works==

Brougham wrote a prodigious number of treatises on science, philosophy, and history. Besides the writings mentioned in this article, he was the author of &quot;Dialogues on Instinct; with Analytical View of the Researches on Fossil Osteology&quot;, &quot;Lives of Statesmen, Philosophers, and Men of Science of the Time of George III&quot;, &quot;Natural Theology&quot;, etc. His last work was an autobiography written in his 84th year and published in 1871.

Brougham&#x27;s &quot;Political Philosophy&quot; was included on the Cambridge syllabus for History and Political Philosophy, where it was considered among the major works on the topic along with Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Politics&quot;, François Guizot&#x27;s &quot;Histoire de la civilization en Europe&quot;, and Henry Hallam&#x27;s &quot;Constitutional History&quot;.

== Collections ==
The papers of the Brougham family were deposited at University College London in 1953, having previously been purchased by C.K. Ogden. The majority of the collection is formed by Henry Brougham&#x27;s extensive correspondence, totalling over 50,000 items. The University also holds the archive of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, which Brougham helped to establish.

<doc id="232018" wikidata="Q1207881" url="?curid=232018" title="Edward Schreyer">
<text>Edward Richard Schreyer (born December 21, 1935) is a Canadian politician, diplomat, and statesman who served as the 22nd governor general of Canada from 1979 to 1984. He previously served as the 16th premier of Manitoba from 1969 to 1977.

Schreyer was born and educated in Manitoba, and was first elected to the province&#x27;s legislative assembly in 1958. He later moved into federal politics, winning a seat in the House of Commons, but returned to Manitoba in 1969 to become leader of the provincial New Democratic Party (NDP). The party then won that year&#x27;s provincial election and Schreyer became the 16th premier of Manitoba, aged 33. In 1978 he was appointed Governor General by Queen Elizabeth II on the recommendation of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, to replace Jules Léger, and he occupied the post until succeeded by Jeanne Sauvé in 1984. As the Queen&#x27;s representative, he was praised for raising the stature of Ukrainian Canadians. Later, he served as Canada&#x27;s High Commissioner to Australia, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu. He then attempted, without success, to get elected to the House of Commons; he was the first person to run for election in Canada after serving as Governor General.

==Early life and youth==
Schreyer was born in Beausejour, Manitoba, to Anglophone ethnic German-Austrian Catholic parents John Schreyer and Elizabeth Gottfried; his maternal grandparents were Austrians who emigrated from western Ukraine. Schreyer attended Cromwell Elementary School and Beausejour Collegiate Secondary School, then United College and St. John&#x27;s College at the University of Manitoba. There, he received a Bachelor of Pedagogy in 1959, a Bachelor of Education in 1962, a Master of Arts in International Relations, and a second Master of Arts in Economics in 1963. From 1962 to 1965, Schreyer served as a professor of International Relations at St. Paul&#x27;s College.
While pursuing his post-graduate degrees, Schreyer married Lily Schultz, with whom he had two daughters, Lisa and Karmel, and two sons, Jason and Toban.

==Political career==
In the Manitoba election of 1958, Schreyer was elected to the legislative assembly as a member of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), in the rural constituency of Brokenhead; at twenty-two years of age, Schreyer was the youngest person ever elected to the assembly. He held the riding until resigning in 1965 to run successfully for the House of Commons in Ottawa. He returned to provincial politics in 1969, and was on June 8 elected leader of the New Democratic Party of Manitoba (NDP), the successor to the Manitoba CCF. He differed in some ways from the previous leaders of Manitoba&#x27;s NDP: he came from a rural background and was not committed to socialism as an ideology; he won the support of many centrist voters who had not previously identified with the party. Also, he was the first leader of the Manitoba CCF/NDP who was not of British and Protestant descent.

Schreyer led his party to a watershed showing in the 1969 provincial election. The NDP picked up 17 seats, vaulting them from third place in the legislature to first place. Schreyer himself returned to the legislature from the newly created north Winnipeg seat of Rossmere.

However, with 28 seats, the NDP was one seat short of a majority. Initially, the Liberals and Progressive Conservatives considered forming a coalition to lock the NDP out of power. Finally, Liberal Laurent Desjardins threw his support to Schreyer (and later joined the NDP after a period as an independent), making Schreyer the first social democratic premier in Manitoba&#x27;s history.

Schreyer&#x27;s premiership oversaw the amalgamation of the city of Winnipeg with its suburbs, introduced public automobile insurance, and significantly reduced medicare premiums. Re-elected in 1973, Schreyer maintained his position as premier, though the council was this time less innovative, the only policy of note being the mining tax legislation implemented in 1974. Schreyer also served as his own minister of finance between 1972 and 1975, and as the minister responsible for Manitoba Hydro from 1971 to 1977. It was from those positions that Schreyer advised the Lieutenant Governor to authorise construction of hydroelectric works instead of coal and gas burning electricity generators, and also put forward legislation that simultaneously eliminated provincial health care premiums and implemented home care and pharmacare. Schreyer sometimes favoured policies different from those of the federal NDP; in 1970, he supported Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s invocation of the War Measures Act in response to the October Crisis, despite the opposition of federal NDP leader Tommy Douglas.

In the 1977 provincial election, Schreyer&#x27;s New Democrats were defeated by the Progressive Conservative Party under Sterling Lyon. He remained leader of the NDP in opposition until 1979, when Trudeau offered him the office of Governor General.

==Governor General of Canada==
On December 28, 1978, Queen Elizabeth II, by commission under the royal sign-manual and Great Seal of Canada, appointed Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s choice of Schreyer to succeed Jules Léger as the Queen&#x27;s representative. He was sworn in during a ceremony in the Senate chamber on January 22, 1979, making him the first Governor General from Manitoba, and, at the age of forty-three, the third youngest ever appointed, after the Marquess of Lorne in 1878 (33 years old), and the Marquess of Lansdowne in 1883 (38 years old).

As Governor General, Schreyer championed women&#x27;s issues, the environment, and official bilingualism. During his first year in office, he established the Governor General&#x27;s Award in Commemoration of the Persons Case, to recognize the efforts of Emily Murphy and others to ensure that Canadian women would be constitutionally recognized as persons. In 1981 he instituted the Governor General&#x27;s Conservation Awards and in 1983 he created the Edward Schreyer Fellowship in Ukrainian Studies at the University of Toronto. Also in 1983, he presided over the first Governor General&#x27;s Canadian Study Conference, which has since been held every four years. Schreyer invested Terry Fox as a companion of the Order of Canada, travelling to Port Coquitlam, British Columbia, to present Fox with the order&#x27;s insignia. In 1980, he caused controversy when he hesitated to call an election after Prime Minister Joe Clark advised him to do so. Schreyer also later suggested that he might have dissolved parliament at any point through 1981 and 1982, had the Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau tried to impose his constitutional proposals unilaterally.

Schreyer&#x27;s wish to connect with people in an open, friendly way conflicted with the &quot;stiff, earnest public manner&quot; expected of the Governor General, and he was thus a target of the media. When Jeanne Sauvé succeeded him, &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; writer Carol Goar compared Sauvé to Schreyer&#x27;s performance, stating that &quot;she is expected to restore grace and refinement to Government House after five years of Edward Schreyer&#x27;s earnest Prairie populism and lacklustre reign.&quot;

==Post viceregal career==

Upon retirement from the post of Governor General in 1984, Schreyer announced that he would donate his pension to the environmental Canadian Shield Foundation; unlike other former viceroys, he intended to remain in political and diplomatic life. On the same day he ceased to be Governor General, he was appointed by his successor to the office of High Commissioner to Australia, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu for Her Majesty&#x27;s Government in Canada. He held those positions until 1988, when he returned to Winnipeg.

On returning to Canada, Schreyer was employed as a national representative of Habitat for Humanity, an honorary director of the Sierra Legal Defence Fund, and an honorary advisor to the Canadian Foundation for the Preservation of Chinese Cultural and Historical Treasures. He was also a founding member of the Winnipeg Library Foundation. Starting in 1989, he acted as a guest professor at universities around North America and Europe, lecturing on matters relating to resource geography, energy economics, and environmental impact. On November 1, 2002, Schreyer was appointed the Chancellor of Brandon University and was re-elected to the position in early 2005 for a term that ended on October 31, 2008.

===Political return===

Schreyer, then seventy years old, ran in the 2006 federal election as the NDP candidate in the riding of Selkirk—Interlake. It was the first time a former Governor General sought election to the Canadian House of Commons; previously, former Lieutenant Governors had been called to the Senate to sit as party members, and some former Governors General who hailed from the United Kingdom returned there to sit with party affiliations in the House of Lords, sometimes even serving in cabinet. Schreyer lost to Conservative incumbent James Bezan, receiving 37% of the vote to Bezan&#x27;s 49%. Earlier comments Schreyer had made describing homosexuality as an &quot;affliction&quot; were raised by his opponents in the campaign, as the NDP supported same-sex marriage. While campaigning in 2005, Schreyer said he supported same-sex marriage as the existing legislation did not force religious institutions to marry same-sex couples.

Schreyer also waded into the federal parliamentary dispute of 2008-09, in which the opposition parties threatened to revoke their confidence in the sitting prime minister, Stephen Harper. Schreyer said: &quot;Any group that presumes to govern must be willing to face and seek the confidence of Parliament, and it mustn&#x27;t be evaded and it mustn&#x27;t be long avoided. I can&#x27;t put it any more succinctly than that... I must come back to your use of the words, &#x27;to duck a confidence vote&#x27;... that must simply not be allowed to happen.&quot;

<text>William Cullen Bryant (November 3, 1794 – June 12, 1878) was an American romantic poet, journalist, and long-time editor of the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot;. Born in Massachusetts, he started his career as a lawyer but showed an interest in poetry early in his life.

In 1825, Bryant relocated to New York City, where he became an editor of two major newspapers. He also emerged as one of the most significant poets in early literary America and has been grouped among the fireside poets for his accessible and popular poetry.

==Early life and education==
Bryant was born on November 3, 1794, in a log cabin near Cummington, Massachusetts; this home of his birth is commemorated with a plaque. He was the second son of Peter Bryant (August 12, 1767 – March 20, 1820), a physician and later a state legislator, and Sarah Snell (December 4, 1768 – May 6, 1847). The genealogy of his mother traces back to passengers on the &quot;Mayflower&quot;, including John Alden (1599–1687), his wife Priscilla Mullins, and her parents William and Alice Mullins. The story of the romance between John and Priscilla is the subject of a famous narrative poem &quot;The Courtship of Miles Standish&quot;, by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, who was also their descendant.

He was the nephew of Charity Bryant, a Vermont-based seamstress, who is the subject of Rachel Hope Cleves&#x27;s 2014 book, &quot;Charity and Sylvia: A Same-Sex Marriage in Early America&quot;. Bryant described their relationship: &quot;If I were permitted to draw the veil of private life, I would briefly give you the singular, and to me interesting, story of two maiden ladies who dwell in this valley. I would tell you how, in their youthful days, they took each other as companions for life, and how this union, no less sacred to them than the tie of marriage, has subsisted, in uninterrupted harmony, for more than forty years.&quot; Charity and Sylvia Drake are buried together at Weybridge Hill Cemetery in Weybridge, Vermont.

Bryant and his family moved to a new home when he was two years old. Bryant&#x27;s boyhood home, William Cullen Bryant Homestead, is now a museum. After just one year at Williams College, which he entered with sophomore standing, Bryant hoped to transfer to Yale. But a talk with his father led him to realize that the family&#x27;s finances could not support it. His father advised Bryant to purse a legal career as his best available choice, and the disappointed poet began to study law in Worthington and Bridgewater in Massachusetts.

In 1815, Bryant was admitted to the bar and began practicing law in nearby Plainfield, walking the seven miles from Cummington every day. On one of these walks, in December 1815, he noticed a single bird flying on the horizon; the sight moved him enough to write &quot;To a Waterfowl&quot;.

Bryant developed his interest in poetry early in life. Under his father&#x27;s tutelage, he emulated Alexander Pope and other Neo-Classic British poets. &quot;The Embargo&quot;, a critical work on President Thomas Jefferson published in 1808, reflected Bryant&#x27;s Federalist political views. The first edition quickly sold out, partly because of publicity attached to Bryant&#x27;s young age at the time of its publication. A second, expanded edition included Bryant&#x27;s translation of classical verse. During his collegiate studies and his reading for the law, he wrote little poetry, but encounters with the Graveyard Poets and then William Wordsworth regenerated his passion for what Bryant called &quot;the witchery of song.&quot;

==Career==
===Early poetry===
&quot;Thanatopsis&quot; is Bryant&#x27;s most famous poem, which Bryant may have been working on as early as 1811.

In 1817, his father took some pages of verse from his son&#x27;s desk, and at the invitation of Willard Phillips, an editor of the &quot;North American Review&quot; who had previously been tutored in the classics by Bryant, submitted them along with his own work. The editor of the &quot;Review,&quot; Edward Tyrrel Channing, read the poem to associate editor Richard Henry Dana Sr., who immediately exclaimed, &quot;That was never written on this side of the water!&quot;

Someone at the &quot;North American&quot; joined two of the son&#x27;s discrete fragments, gave the result the Greek-derived title &quot;Thanatopsis&quot; (&quot;meditation on death&quot;), mistakenly attributed it to the father, and published it. After clarification of the authorship, the son&#x27;s poems began appearing with some regularity in the &quot;Review&quot;. A portion of Bryant&#x27;s poem, &quot;Thanatopsis,&quot; is at the base of the William Cullen Bryant Memorial behind the New York Public Library, which was dedicated in 1911. &quot;To a Waterfowl&quot;, published in 1821, was the most popular.

On January 11, 1821, still striving to build a legal career, Bryant married Frances Fairchild. Soon after, he received an invitation to speak from Phi Beta Kappa at Harvard University to deliver the August commencement. Bryant spent months working on &quot;The Ages&quot;, a panorama in verse of the history of civilization, culminating in the establishment of the United States. He subsequently published &quot;The Ages&quot;, which led the volume and was titled &quot;Poems&quot;, which he arranged to publish on the same trip to Harvard. For that book, he added sets of lines at the beginning and end of &quot;Thanatopsis&quot; that changed the poem.

&quot;Thanatopsis&quot; established Bryant&#x27;s career as a poet. From 1816 to 1825, Bryant depended on his law practice in Great Barrington, Massachusetts to sustain his family financially but he traded his unrewarding profession for New York City and the promise of a literary career. With the encouragement of a distinguished and well-connected literary family, the Sedgwicks, he quickly gained a foothold in New York City&#x27;s vibrant cultural life.

By 1832, after publishing an expanded version of &quot;Poems&quot; in the U.S. and, with the assistance of Washington Irving, in Great Britain, Bryant began to be recognized as one of his generation&#x27;s greatest poets.

===&quot;New-York Review&quot;===
Bryant&#x27;s first employment, in 1825, was as editor of the &quot;New-York Review&quot;, which merged with the &quot;United States Review and Literary Gazette&quot; the following year, in 1826. Bryant&#x27;s stories over the seven-year period from his time with the &quot;Review&quot; to the publication of &quot;Tales of Glauber Spa&quot; in 1832 show a variety of strategies, making him the most inventive of practitioners of the genre during this early stage of its evolution.

===&quot;New-York Evening Post&quot;===
In the throes of the failing struggle to raise subscriptions, he accepted part-time duties with the &quot;New-York Evening Post&quot; under William Coleman; then, partly because of Coleman&#x27;s ill health, traceable to the consequences of a duel and then a stroke, Bryant&#x27;s responsibilities expanded rapidly. From assistant editor he rose to editor-in-chief and co-owner of the newspaper that had been founded by Alexander Hamilton. Over the next half century, the &quot;Post&quot; would become the most respected paper in the city and, from the election of Andrew Jackson, the major platform in the Northeast for the Democratic Party and subsequently of the Free Soil and Republican Parties. In the process, the &quot;Evening-Post&quot; also became the pillar of a substantial fortune. Despite his Federalist beginnings, Bryant had shifted to being one of the most liberal voices of the century.

An early supporter of organized labor, with his 1836 editorials asserting the right of workmen to strike, Bryant also defended religious minorities and immigrants, and promoted the abolition of slavery. He &quot;threw himself into the foreground of the battle for human rights&quot; and did not cease speaking out against the corrupting influence of certain bankers in spite of their efforts to break down the paper. According to newspaper historian Frank Luther Mott, Bryant was &quot;a great liberal seldom done justice by modern writers&quot;.

He was elected an associate fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1855.

Despite his once staunch opposition to Thomas Jefferson and his party, Bryant became one of the key supporters in the Northeast of that same party under Jackson. Bryant&#x27;s views, always progressive though not quite populist, led him to join the Free Soilers when the Free Soil Party became a core of the new Republican Party in 1856.

Bryant vigorously campaigned for John Frémont, which enhanced his standing in party councils. In 1860, he was one of the prime Eastern exponents of Abraham Lincoln, and Bryant introduced Lincoln at Cooper Union prior to his Cooper Union speech, which was considered influential in lifting Lincoln to the nomination and then the presidency. In the 1860 presidential election, he elected Lincoln and Hannibal Hamlin as a presidential elector.

===&quot;Picturesque America&quot;===
Bryant edited &quot;Picturesque America&quot;, which was published between 1872 and 1874. This two-volume set was lavishly illustrated and described scenic places in the United States and Canada.

===Translation of Homer===
In his final years, Bryant shifted from writing his own poetry to a blank verse translation of Homer&#x27;s works. He assiduously worked on the &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;The Odyssey&quot; from 1871 to 1874. He is also remembered as one of the principal authorities on homeopathy and as a hymnist for the Unitarian Church, both legacies of his father&#x27;s influence on him.

In 1843, Bryant bought a house in Roslyn Harbor on Long Island. He christened and named the house Cedarmere because of the cedar trees around its pond.

In 1865, he bought the farmhouse in Cummington, where he grew up and summered annually until his death. He made substantial improvements to the houses at both properties. He was known for his attention to trees on his land, and later in life he expressed concerns that deforestation in the United States would prove disastrous for American agriculture.

==Death==
Bryant died in 1878 of complications from an accidental fall suffered after participating in a Central Park ceremony to honor Italian patriot Giuseppe Mazzini. He is buried at Roslyn Cemetery in Greenvale, New York.

==Critical response==

Bryant became one of the most significant poets in early American literary history. He is typically included among the group of poets referred to as the fireside poets, along with Longfellow, John Greenleaf Whittier, James Russell Lowell, and Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. They are considered to be among the first American poets whose popularity rivaled that of British poets, both at home and abroad and are so named because their writing was a source of entertainment for families gathered around the fire at home. Bryant&#x27;s poetry has been described as being &quot;of a thoughtful, meditative character, and makes but slight appeal to the mass of readers.&quot;

Edgar Allan Poe praised Bryant and specifically the poem &quot;June&quot; in his essay &quot;The Poetic Principle&quot;:
The rhythmical flow, here, is even voluptuous—nothing could be more melodious. The poem has always affected me in a remarkable manner. The intense melancholy which seems to well up, perforce, to the surface of all the poet&#x27;s cheerful sayings about his grave, we find thrilling us to the soul—while there is the truest poetic elevation in the thrill. The impression left is one of a pleasurable sadness.

Editor and children&#x27;s writer Mary Mapes Dodge wrote that Bryant&#x27;s poems &quot;have wrought vast and far-reaching good in the world.&quot; She predicted, &quot;You will admire more and more, as you grow older, the noble poems of this great and good man.&quot; Poet and literary critic Thomas Holley Chivers said that the &quot;only thing [Bryant] ever wrote that may be called &quot;Poetry&quot; is &#x27;Thanatopsis&#x27;, which he stole &quot;line for line&quot; from the Spanish. The fact is, that he never did anything but steal—as nothing he ever wrote is original.&quot; Writer and critic John Neal wrote in &quot;American Writers&quot; (1824–25): &quot;Mr. B. is not and never will be a good poet. He wants fire—he wants the very rashness of a poet—the prodigality and fervor of those who are overflowing with inspiration.&quot; This critique may have influenced Lowell, who wrote a very similar criticism in his 1848 poem &quot;A Fable for Critics&quot;.

Bryant&#x27;s poetry is tender and graceful, pervaded by a contemplative melancholy, and a love of solitude and the silence of the woods. Though he was brought up to admire Pope, and in his early youth imitated him, he was one of the first American poets to throw off his influence. Bryant had an interest in science and in geology especially. Thomas Cole was a friend and both, at different times, considered the &quot;geological structure&quot; of Volterra in Italy. He met Charles Lyell in England in 1845.

As a writer, Bryant was an early advocate of American literary nationalism, and his own poetry focusing on nature as a metaphor for truth established a central pattern in the American literary tradition.

Some however, argue that a reassessment is long overdue. It finds great merit in a couple of short stories Bryant wrote while trying to build interest in periodicals he edited. More importantly, it perceives a poet of great technical sophistication who was a progenitor of Walt Whitman, to whom he was a mentor.

==Legacy==

Although Bryant was born in New England, where his family had deep ties, he spent almost all of his life as a devout and influential New Yorker. He helped conceive of the idea of a large park in Manhattan, which ultimately led to development of Central Park. He also was a leading proponent of creating the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and he was one of a group of founders of New York Medical College. He had close affinities with the Hudson River School of art and was a close friend of Thomas Cole.

In 1884, in recognition of Bryant, Reservoir Square, at the intersection of 42nd Street and Sixth Avenue, was renamed Bryant Park. Reservoir Square was behind New York City&#x27;s massive above-ground reservoir, on Fifth Avenue. In 1900 the reservoir was demolished and replaced by the main building of the New York Public Library. In 1915, a statue of William Cullen Bryant by sculptor Herbert Adams was one of the statues of “Eminent Americans” that surrounded The Palace of Fine Arts at the Panama Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco, California. The William Cullen Bryant Memorial in Bryant Park includes a bronze of the same work.

Just outside New York City, the Long Island village of Roslyn Harbor, New York is home to the William Cullen Bryant Preserve, located on land he formerly owned next to what is now the Nassau County Museum of Art. Bryant is also the namesake of the Bryant Library in Roslyn, New York, located near his Cedarmere Estate.

Other locations named after Bryant include: Bryant, a neighborhood in Seattle; Bryant Woods, one of the four original villages in Columbia, Maryland; Cullen Bryant Park in Toronto, Ontario; the Bryant Free Library in Cummington, Massachusetts; and the Bryant House at Williams College.

Several schools are named after Bryant, including William Cullen Bryant High School in Long Island City, New York, and elementary schools in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Teaneck, New Jersey, Long Beach, California, Cleveland, Ohio, and Great Barrington, Massachusetts. A rural schoolhouse in Sanford, Maine was also named for Bryant.

The William Cullen Bryant Viaduct between Flower Hill and Roslyn, New York is named in honor of Bryant – as is The Bryant Library, which serves as the Roslyn community&#x27;s public library.

Martin Luther King Jr. quoted Bryant in his speech &quot;Give Us the Ballot&quot;, when he said, &quot;there is something in this universe which justifies William Cullen Bryant in saying: &#x27;Truth crushed to earth will rise again.

<text>Cephalic disorders () are congenital conditions that stem from damage to, or abnormal development of, the budding nervous system.

Cephalic disorders are not necessarily caused by a single factor, but may be influenced by hereditary or genetic conditions, nutritional deficiencies, or by environmental exposures during pregnancy, such as medication taken by the mother, maternal infection, or exposure to radiation. Some cephalic disorders occur when the cranial sutures (the fibrous joints that connect the bones of the skull) join prematurely. Most cephalic disorders are caused by a disturbance that occurs very early in the development of the fetal nervous system.

The human nervous system develops from a small, specialized plate of cells on the surface of the embryo. Early in development, this plate of cells forms the neural tube, a narrow sheath that closes between the third and fourth weeks of pregnancy to form the brain and spinal cord of the embryo. Four main processes are responsible for the development of the nervous system: cell proliferation, the process in which nerve cells divide to form new generations of cells; cell migration, the process in which nerve cells move from their place of origin to the place where they will remain for life; cell differentiation, the process during which cells acquire individual characteristics; and apoptosis, a natural process in which cells die.

Damage to the developing nervous system is a major cause of chronic, disabling disorders and, sometimes, death in infants, children, and even adults. The degree to which damage to the developing nervous system harms the mind and body varies enormously. Many disabilities are mild enough to allow those affected to eventually function independently in society, others are not. Some infants, children, and adults die, others remain totally disabled, and an even larger population is partially disabled, functioning well below normal capacity throughout life.

The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is currently &quot;conducting and supporting research on normal and abnormal brain and nervous system development.&quot;

<text>Chiang Mai is the largest city in northern Thailand, the capital of Chiang Mai province and the second largest city in Thailand. It is north of Bangkok in a mountainous region called the Thai highlands and has a population of 1.2 million people as of 2022, which is more than 66 percent of the total population of Chiang Mai province (1.8 million).

Chiang Mai (meaning &quot;new city&quot; in Thai) was founded in 1296 as the new capital of Lan Na, succeeding the former capital, Chiang Rai. The city&#x27;s location on the Ping River (a major tributary of the Chao Phraya River) and its proximity to major trading routes contributed to its historic importance.

The city municipality of Chiang Mai (&quot;thesaban nakhon&quot;) officially only covers parts (40.2 km²) of the Mueang Chiang Mai district in the city centre and has a population of 127,000. This census area dates back to 1983 when Chiang Mai&#x27;s municipal area was enlarged for the first and last time since becoming the first City Municipality in Thailand (then under Siam) in 1935. The city&#x27;s sprawl has since extended into several neighboring districts, namely Hang Dong in the south, Mae Rim in the north, Suthep in the west and San Kamphaeng in the east, forming the Chiang Mai urban area with over a million residents.

The city municipality is subdivided into four &quot;khwaeng&quot; (electoral wards): Nakhon Ping, Sriwichai, Mengrai, and Kawila. The first three are on the west bank of the Ping River, and Kawila is on the east bank. Nakhon Ping District includes the northern part of the city. Sriwichai, Mengrai, and Kawila consist of the western, southern, and eastern parts, respectively. The city center—within the city walls—is mostly within Sriwichai ward.

== History ==

Mangrai founded Chiang Mai in 1294 or 1296 on a site that the Lawa people called Wiang Nopburi.

The city succeeded Chiang Rai as the capital of Lan Na. Pha Yu enlarged and fortified it and built Wat Phra Singh in honor of his father, Kham Fu. With the decline of Lan Na, Chiang Mai lost importance and was occupied by the Taungoo in 1556. It formally became part of the Thonburi Kingdom in 1774, by an agreement with Chao Kavila, after the Thonburi king Taksin helped drive out the Taungoo Bamar. Subsequent Taungoo counterattacks led to Chiang Mai&#x27;s abandonment between 1776 and 1791;

The modern municipality dates to a sanitary district (&quot;sukhaphiban&quot;) that was created in 1915; it was upgraded to a city municipality (&quot;thesaban nakhon&quot;) on 29 March 1935. First covering just , the city was enlarged to on 5 April 1983.

In May 2006 Chiang Mai was the site of the Chiang Mai Initiative, concluded between ASEAN and the &quot;ASEAN+3&quot; countries, (China, Japan, and South Korea). Chiang Mai was one of three Thai cities contending for Thailand&#x27;s bid to host the World Expo 2020. Ayutthaya was ultimately chosen by the Thai parliament to register for the international competition.

Chiang Mai was one of two tourist destinations in Thailand on TripAdvisor&#x27;s 2014 list of &quot;25 Best Destinations in the World&quot;, where it stood at number 24. Chiang Mai is also the place where the new idol group CGM48 was founded.

=== Emblem ===
The city emblem shows the stupa at Wat Phra That Doi Suthep in its center. Below it are clouds representing the moderate climate in the mountains of northern Thailand. There is a nāga, the mythical snake said to be the source of the Ping River, and rice stalks, which refer to the fertility of the land.

== Demography ==

=== Population ===

Following the municipal city area&#x27;s enlargement to 40,2 km² in 1983, no changes or updates have been made to it, even with the population increasing substantially in the years after. In 1983, Chiang Mai&#x27;s urban area, with a population of 127,000, already exceeded the municipal city limits, and has grown to over one million people in 2022.

Chiang Mai Municipality has now become a small part of the current city-scape, making up only most parts of the capital district Amphoe Mueang Chiang Mai in the inner city. To reflect the city&#x27;s growth beyond the municipal borders, official government documents by the Chiang Mai Provincial Administrative Organization and the Department of Public Works and Town &amp; Country Planning - published in the Royal Thai Government Gazette - regularly update and outline the current city boundaries. The first revision of such a updated urban area () was published in 1989, with the second one following in 1999. The third revision from 2012 expands the old municipal city border inside Muaeng Chiang Mai district to Mae Rim in the north, San Kamphaeng and Doi Saket in the east, Hang Dong and Saraphi in the south, and Suthep in the west. This new extent, with a size of 405 km², serves as Chiang Mai&#x27;s principal city border and urban area.

The urban area has a combined population of 1,198,000 residents, making Chiang Mai the second largest city in Thailand after Bangkok (10.7 million people) and twice as big as the third largest city Nakhon Ratchasima (Estimate: 500,000 people). As neither the Department of Local Administration (DLA) nor the National Statistics Office (NSO) count expatriates, non-permanent residents, migrant workers (except ASEAN migrants for the year 2017) and citizens from other Thai provinces living and renting in Chiang Mai in their official population figures, it is estimated that the real population figure for Chiang Mai could be as high as 1.5 million.&lt;mapframe latitude=&quot;18.795168&quot; longitude=&quot;98.998489&quot; zoom=&quot;10&quot; width=&quot;324&quot; height=&quot;247&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; text=&quot;Chiang Mai Municipality (Dark Grey, Area 40.2 km²) within the Chiang Mai Urban Area (Light Grey, Area 405 km²) as defined by the Provincial Administrative Organisation and the Ministry of Interior.&quot;&gt;

}

&lt;/mapframe&gt;As of 2022, a fourth revision of Chiang Mai&#x27;s urban area is under way and currently up for debate by the public. Proposals show the expansion of the current urban area into more adjacent subdistricts and large forest areas, especially around Doi Suthep.

Since Thailand&#x27;s outdated census methods prevent the determination of official metropolitan areas outside of Bangkok, presently there are no official sources indicating how large the extended metropolitan area is.

== Geography ==
Chiang Mai Municipality covers an area of 40.2 square kilometres (15.52 sq mi), while the urban city covers an area of 405 square kilometres (156.371 sq mi). The city&#x27;s sprawl reaches into six neighboring districts: Mae Rim, Doi Saket, San Kamphaeng, Hang Dong, Saraphi and Suthep. Chiang Mai is the only city outside Bangkok to reach into other districts.

The city is situated in a valley on a river basin in the Thai highlands and is on average at 300 m (1,000 ft) elevation. Chiang Mai&#x27;s city centre sits west of the Ping River, a tributary to the Chao Phraya River, while the city&#x27;s sprawl extends north-west, south-west, north-east and east of the river. To the west side of Chiang Mai lies the Thanon Thong Chai Mountain Range, with one major peak, Doi Suthep mountain, prominently rising above the city with an elevation of 1,676 metres (5,499 ft).

=== Parks and green spaces ===
There are several parks and green spaces inside the city. Buak Hat Public Park, located in the south west corner of the old city is the most frequented public park in Chiang Mai. Directly opposite, to the south-west, is Kanchanaphisek Park, a park with remnants of the old extended city walls. Bigger parks include Lanna Rama 9 Park to the north in Chang Phueak district and Ang Keaw Reservoir, located near the northern entrance to Chiang Mai University. As of 2024, there are plans to reopen the Chiang Mai Railway Park opposite of the central train station.

=== Climate ===
Chiang Mai has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen &quot;Aw&quot;), tempered by the low latitude and moderate elevation, with warm to hot weather year-round, though nighttime conditions during the dry season can be cool and much lower than daytime highs. The maximum temperature ever recorded was in May 2016. Cold and hot weather effects occur immediately but cold effects last longer than hot effects and contribute to higher cold related mortality risk among old people aged more than 85 years.

== Government ==
The Administration of Chiang Mai Municipality is responsible for an area that covers approximately 40.216 square kilometers and consists of 4 Municipal Districts, 14 sub-districts, 94 municipal communities, and 89,656 households.

According to Municipal Act B.E. 2496 (1953, reviewed in 2003), the duties of the Municipality cover a lot of areas which include clean water supply, waste and sewage disposal, communicable disease control, public training and education, public hospitals and electricity, etc.

The mayor, or the highest executive, is directly elected by the eligible voters in the municipal area. The mayor serves a four-year term and is assisted by no more than four deputy mayors appointed directly by the mayor. The mayor will thus be permitted to appoint deputies, secretaries and advisors including the mayor himself or herself totally no more than 10. The current mayor is Tussanai Burabupakorn, as of June 2018.

The Municipal Council is the legislative body of the municipality. It has the power to issue ordinances by laws that do not contradict with the laws of the country. The municipal council applies to all people living in the municipal area. The Chiang Mai City Municipal Council is composed of 24 elected members from 4 municipal districts who each serves a 4-year term.

== Economy ==

=== Development initiatives ===
In February 2017, the Digital Economy Promotion Agency (DEPA) (under Thailand&#x27;s Digital Economy and Society Ministry) announced that 36.5 million baht would be invested into developing Chiang Mai into an innovation-driven &quot;smart city&quot;. Chiang Mai was the second city in Thailand, after Phuket and along with Khon Kaen, to be developed using the &quot;smart city&quot; model. The model aims to capture and populate multiple levels of information (including building, social, environmental, governmental, and economic data) from sources like sensors, real-time traffic information, and social forums for access by managers, governments, and citizens using mobile apps, tablets, and dashboards. The &quot;Smart City&quot; outlook (integrating Information and Communications Technology (ICT) with the Internet of Things (IOT)), is viewed to be critical both for secondary cities with burgeoning urban population like Chiang Mai, as well as part of Thailand&#x27;s move to be digital hub of ASEAN. The role of private sector investment, together with public sector partnership, is key to promote digital entrepreneurship. Prosoft Comtech, a Thai software company, has spent 300 million baht to build its own &quot;Oon IT Valley&quot; on a 90 rai plot of land as a community for tech start-ups, Internet of Things technology, software programmers and business process outsourcing services. It is aimed to both increase the size of Chiang Mai&#x27;s digital workforce, as well as attract foreign digital talent to Chiang Mai.

==== Smart transportation ====
In January 2018, it was announced that Chiang Mai would be launching &quot;Mobike In&quot;, a bike-sharing app that would see the introduction of some 500 smart bikes on the streets. The smart bikes would be available for use for both locals and tourists. It is reported that as a start, the bikes would be placed at convenient locations including the Three Kings monument, Tha Pae Gate and Suan Buak Haad Park, as well as in the old town. The &quot;Mobike In&quot; project is sponsored by Advanced Info Service (Thailand&#x27;s largest mobile phone operator), in collaboration with the Tourism Authority of Thailand (Chiang Mai Office), together with local universities, public and private sectors. The project aims to promote non-motorised transportation and support eco-tourism. Speaking at the launch at the Lanna Folklife Museum, Deputy Governor Puttipong Sirimart stated that the introduction of such &quot;smart transportation&quot; was a positive move in Chiang Mai&#x27;s transformation into a &quot;Smart City&quot; (part of the &quot;Thailand 4.0&quot; vision).

==== Smart agriculture ====
DEPA has also provided funding to Chiang Mai&#x27;s Maejo University, to develop wireless sensor systems for better farmland irrigation techniques, to reduce use of water sprinklers and increase productivity. The university is also developing agricultural drones that can spray fertilizers and pesticides on crops which, if successful, will result in lower costs. The drones may also detect and monitor fires and smoke pollution.

Under the 2011 IBM &quot;Smarter Cities Challenge&quot;, IBM experts recommended smarter food initiatives focused on creating agricultural data for farmers, including price modelling, farmer-focused weather forecasting tools, an e-portal to help farmers align crop production with demand, as well as branding of Chiang Mai produce. Longer-term recommendations included implementing traceability, enabling the tracking of produce from farm to consumer, smarter irrigation as well as flood control and early warning systems.

==== Smart healthcare ====
As part of the smart city project supported by IBM, Chiang Mai is also looking to use technology to boost its presence as a medical tourism hub. In 2011, IBM launched its Smarter Cities Challenge, a three-year, 100 city, 1.6 billion baht (US$50 million) program where teams of experts study and make detailed recommendations to address local important urban issues. Chiang Mai won a grant of about US$400,000 in 2011. The IBM team focused on smarter healthcare initiatives, aimed at making Chiang Mai and the University Medical Clinic a medical hub, as well as improving efficiency of hospitals for improved service delivery. For example, healthcare providers could use real-time location tracking of patients and hospital assets to increase efficiency and build an internationally recognised service identity. Electronic medical record technology can also be adopted to standardise information exchanges to link all medical service providers, even including traditional medicine and spas. Similar ideas include linking patient databases and healthcare asset information. In partnership with the Faculty of Medicine at Chiang Mai University, the team of experts aim to enhance the quality of medical care available to the community, both urban and rural, as well as develop Chiang Mai into a centre for medical tourism with the infrastructure for supporting international visitors seeking long-term medical care.

As the largest city in northern Thailand, Chiang Mai already receives some long stay healthcare visitors, largely Japanese. Its main advantage over Bangkok is lower costs of living. Quality services at low prices are a major selling point in mainstream healthcare, dental and ophthalmologic care as well as Thai traditional medicine. Its local university is also developing specializations in robotic surgery and geriatric medicine to accommodate a future aging population.

==== Smart tourism ====
DEPA also reported that it has developed a mobile app that uses augmented reality technology to showcase various historical attractions in Chiang Mai, in line with the government&#x27;s policy to promote Chiang Mai as a world heritage city.

== Tourism ==
According to Thailand&#x27;s Tourist Authority, in 2013 Chiang Mai had 14.1 million visitors: 4.6 million foreigners and 9.5 million Thais. In 2016, tourist arrivals were expected to grow by approximately 10 percent to 9.1 million, with Chinese tourists increasing by seven percent to 750,000 and international arrivals by 10 percent to 2.6 million. Tourism in Chiang Mai has been growing annually by 15 percent per year since 2011, mostly due to Chinese tourists who account for 30 percent of international arrivals. In 2015, 7.4 million tourists visited Chiang Mai. Out of these, 35 percent were foreign tourists. The number of tourists has increased with an average rate of 13.6 percent annually between 2009 and 2015. The major reasons that have made Chiang Mai a tourist attraction are its topography, climate, and cultural history. Chiang Mai is estimated to have 32,000–40,000 hotel rooms and Chiang Mai International Airport (CNX) is Thailand&#x27;s fourth largest airport, after Suvarnabhumi (BKK), Don Mueang (DMK), and Phuket (HKT).

The Thailand Convention and Exhibition Bureau (TCEB) aims to market Chiang Mai as a global MICE city as part of a five-year plan. The TCEB forecasts revenue from MICE to rise by 10 percent to 4.24 billion baht in 2013 and the number of MICE travellers to rise by five percent to 72,424.

=== Buddhist sights ===
Chiang Mai has 117 Buddhist temples (&quot;wat&quot; in Thai) in the Mueang (capital) district. These include:
* Wat Phra That Doi Suthep, the city&#x27;s most famous temple, stands on Doi Suthep, a mountain to the north-west of the city, at an elevation of 1,073 meters.
* Wat Chiang Man, the oldest temple in Chiang Mai, dating from the 13th century. King Mengrai lived here during the construction of the city. This temple houses two important and venerated Buddha figures, the marble Phra Sila and the crystal Phra Satang Man.
* Wat Phra Singh is within the city walls, dates from 1345, and offers an example of classic Northern Thai-style architecture. It houses the Phra Singh Buddha, a highly venerated figure brought here many years ago from Chiang Rai.
* Wat Chedi Luang was founded in 1401 and is dominated by a large Lanna style chedi, which took many years to finish. An earthquake damaged the chedi in the 16th century and only two-thirds of it remains.
* Wat Ku Tao in the city&#x27;s Chang Phuak District dates from (at least) the 13th century and is distinguished by an unusual alms-bowl-shaped stupa thought to contain the ashes of King Nawrahta Minsaw, Chiang Mai&#x27;s first Bamar ruler.
* Wat Chet Yot is on the outskirts of the city. Built in 1455, the temple hosted the Eighth World Buddhist Council in 1477.
* Wat Sri Suphan is known as the &quot;Silver Temple&quot; because its ordination hall was constructed using silver, aluminium and nickel.
* Wat Umong is a forest and cave wat in the foothills west of the city, near Chiang Mai University. Wat U-Mong is known for its &quot;fasting Buddha&quot;, representing the Buddha at the end of his long and fruitless fast prior to gaining enlightenment.
* Wat Rampoeng (Wat Tapotaram), near Wat U-Mong, is known for its meditation center (Northern Insight Meditation Center). The temple teaches the traditional vipassanā technique and students stay from 10 days to more than a month as they try to meditate at least 10 hours a day. Wat RamPoeng houses the largest collection of &quot;Tipitaka&quot;, the complete Theravada canon, in several Northern dialects.
* Wat Suan Dok is a 14th-century temple just west of the old city wall. It was built by the king for a revered monk visiting from Sukhothai for a rainy season retreat. The temple is also the site of Mahachulalongkorn Rajavidyalaya Buddhist University, where monks pursue their studies.
* Wat Pan Sao is a temple under the Mahanikaya sect of Buddhism an features a Chiang Mai-style stupa influenced by Sukhothai architecture. 

In addition to the currently active temples there are several temple ruins scattered around the present-day city area. Typically only the main stupa remains as it is a brick and cement structure, with other temple buildings no longer there. There are 44 of such structures in the city area, ranging from very prominent landmarks to small remnants that have almost completely disappeared or are overgrown with vegetation.

=== Other religious sights ===
* &quot;First Church&quot; was founded in 1868 by the Laos Mission of the Rev. Daniel and Mrs. Sophia McGilvary. Chiang Mai has about 20 Christian churches. Chiang Mai is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Chiang Mai at Sacred Heart Cathedral.
* The office of the Christian Conference of Asia is located in Chiang Mai.
* Muslim traders have traveled to north Thailand for many centuries, and a small settled presence has existed in Chiang Mai from at least the middle of the 19th century. The city has mosques identified with Chinese or Chin Haw Muslims as well as Muslims of Bengali, Pathan, and Malay descent. In 2011, there were 16 mosques in the city.
* Two gurdwaras (Sikh places of worship), Siri Guru Singh Sabha and Namdhari, serve the city&#x27;s Sikh community.
* The Hindu temple Dev Mandir serves the Hindu community.
===Historical sights===
*Chang Phueak Monument
*Khuang Singh Monument
*Three Kings Monument
*Chedi Kiew

=== Museums ===
Chiang Mai has several museums regarding Art and Lanna culture within its city limits:

* Chiang Mai City Arts and Cultural Center
* Chiang Mai National Museum, which highlights the history of the region and the Kingdom of Lan Na.
* Chiang Mai Philatelic Museum, showing the history of postage stamps and postal development of Thailand, especially of Chiang Mai. 
* Highland People Discovery Museum, a showcase on the history of the local mountain tribes.
* Mint Bureau of Chiang Mai or Sala Thanarak, Treasury Department, Ministry of Finance, Rajdamnern Road (one block from AUA Language Center). Has an old coin museum open to the public during business hours. The Lan Na Kingdom used leaf (or line) money made of brass and silver bubbles, also called &quot;pig-mouth&quot; money. The exact original technique of making pig-mouth money is still disputed, and because the silver is very thin and breakable, good pieces are now very rare.
* Bank of Thailand Museum
* Northern Telecoms of Thailand Museum, housed in a former telephone exchange building, displaying the history and evolution of telecommunications in Northern Thailand.
* MAIIAM Contemporary Art Museum, a museum of contemporary art which opened in 2016. It is one of only two museums of contemporary art in Thailand, with the other museum, the Museum of Contemporary Art of Bangkok, considered somewhat more conservative in tastes than MAIIAM.

=== Effects of tourism ===
The influx of tourists has put a strain on the city&#x27;s natural resources. Faced with rampant unplanned development, air and water pollution, waste management problems, and traffic congestion, the city has launched a non-motorised transport (NMT) system. The initiative, developed by a partnership of experts and with support from the Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network, aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create employment opportunities for the urban poor. The climate compatible development strategy has gained support from policy-makers and citizens alike.

Tourism has also brought benefits for the local community of Chiang Mai. It has played a role in promoting the arts and crafts market in Chiang Mai. Tourists have increased demand for traditional crafts and art forms that has resulted in the incentives for local artists to enhance their work thus adding to the sector. There are also opportunities for agritourism in Chiang Mai. The factor analysis illustrates three types of agri needs, activities and shopping, facilities, services and location and the last one attractions and environment. Agritoursim is a type of business that a farmer conducts for additional farm income. Farmers, through the promotions of agricultural products, provide enjoyment and educate the public about farming and agriculture.

Since 2022, due to the increasingly harsh political environment in China, Chiang Mai attracts many Chinese to settle and live in the city due to its liberal climate and low cost of living.

== Culture ==

=== Festivals ===

* Loi Krathong (along with Yi Peng), held on the full moon of the 12th month of the traditional Thai lunar calendar, being the full moon of the second month of the old Lanna calendar. In the Western calendar this usually falls in November. Every year thousands of people assemble floating banana-leaf containers (&quot;krathong&quot;) decorated with flowers and candles and deposit them on the waterways of the city in worship of the Goddess of Water. Lanna-style sky lanterns (&quot;khom fai&quot; or &quot;kom loi&quot;), which are hot-air balloons made of paper, are launched into the air. These sky lanterns are believed to help rid the locals of troubles and are also used to decorate houses and streets.
* &quot;Songkran&quot; is held in mid-April to celebrate the traditional Thai New Year. Chiang Mai has become one of the most popular locations to visit during this festival. A variety of religious and fun-related activities (notably the indiscriminate citywide water fight) take place each year, along with parades and Miss Songkran beauty competition.
* Chiang Mai Flower Festival is a three-day festival held during the first weekend in February each year; this event occurs when Chiang Mai&#x27;s temperate and tropical flowers are in full bloom.
* Tam Bun Khan Dok, the Inthakhin (City Pillar) Festival, starts on the day of the waning moon of the sixth lunar month and lasts 6–8 days.

=== Buddhism ===
Buddhist celebrations include the Vesak at Doi Suthep mountain where thousands of Buddhists make the journey on foot after sunset, from the bottom of the mountain to the temple at the top Wat Doi Suthep. Makha Bucha Day is celebrated at large temples (Wat Phra Singh, Wat Chedi Luang, Wat Phra That Doi Suthep, and Wat Sri Soda) with thousands of attendees.

=== Language ===
While most inhabitants speak Thai, there are many older inhabitants that also speak the former Lan Na Kingdom&#x27;s unique language known as Northern Thai, &quot;Lanna&quot; or &quot;Kham Mueang&quot;. The script used to write this language, called the Tai Tham alphabet, is studied only by scholars, and the language is commonly written with the standard Thai alphabet.

=== Dining ===
Khan tok is a century-old Lan Na Thai tradition.

== Health and Education ==

=== Education ===

Chiang Mai has several universities, including Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai Rajabhat University, Rajamangala University of Technology Lanna, Payap University, Far Eastern University, and Maejo University, as well as numerous technical and teacher colleges.

The city is also home to 16 international schools, the second highest amount in the country after Bangkok.

Chiang Mai University, the city&#x27;s main and most important institution, was the first government university established outside of Bangkok in the year 1964. As of 2024, Chiang Mai University holds the rank of the third best university in Thailand behind Chulalongkorn and Mahidol University.

=== Healthcare ===
The largest hospital in Chiang Mai City is Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital, run by the Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University. The Ministry of Public Health does not operate any hospitals in Chiang Mai Municipality, with the closest one being Nakornping Hospital, a regional hospital in Mae Rim District and the MOPH&#x27;s largest hospital in the province.

== Air pollution ==
A continuing environmental issue in Chiang Mai is the incidence of air pollution that primarily occurs every year between December and April. In 1996, speaking at the Fourth International Network for Environmental Compliance and Enforcement conference—held in Chiang Mai that year—the Governor Virachai Naewboonien invited guest speaker Dr. Jakapan Wongburanawatt, Dean of the Social Science Faculty of Chiang Mai University, to discuss air pollution efforts in the region. Dr. Wongburanawatt stated that, in 1994, an increasing number of city residents attended hospitals suffering from respiratory problems associated with the city&#x27;s air pollution.

During the December–April period, air quality in Chiang Mai often remains below recommended standards, with fine-particle dust levels reaching twice the standard limits. It has been said that smoke pollution has made March &quot;the worst month to visit Chiang Mai&quot;.

The northern centre of the Meteorological Department has reported that low-pressure areas from China trap forest fire smoke in the mountains along the Thai-Myanmar border. Research conducted between 2005 and 2009 showed that average PM10 rates in Chiang Mai during February and March were considerably above the country&#x27;s safety level of 120 μg/m³, peaking at 383 μg/m³ on 14 March 2007. PM2.5 rates (fine particles 75% smaller than PM10) reached 183 μg/m³ in Chiang Mai in 2018. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the acceptable level of PM10 is 50 μg/m³ and PM2.5 is 25 μg/m³.

To address the increasing amount of greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector in Chiang Mai, the city government has advocated the use of non-motorised transport (NMT). In addition to its potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the NMT initiative addresses other issues such as traffic congestion, air quality, income generation for the poor, and the long-term viability of the tourism industry.

== National Parks ==

National Parks include Doi Inthanon National Park, which includes Doi Inthanon, the highest mountain in Thailand, and one of the most popular national parks in the country. It is famous for its waterfalls, few trails, remote villages, viewpoints, sunrise/sunset watching, bird watching, and the all year round cold weather on higher elevations.

=== Doi Suthep-Pui National Park ===
Doi Suthep–Pui National Park begins on the western edge of the city. Wat Doi Suthep Buddhist temple, located near the summit of Doi Suthep, can be seen from much of the city and its environs. In 2015, a development plan around the temple for a new housing project threatened to destroy some of the forest, but was halted, resulting in reforestation of the park.

=== Pha Daeng National Park ===
Pha Daeng National Park, also known as &quot;Chiang Dao National Park&quot;, includes Doi Chiang Dao and Pha Deang mountain near the border with Myanmar. Many tour companies offer organized treks among the local hills and forests on foot and on elephant back. Most also involve visits to various local hill tribes, including the Akha, Hmong, Karen, and Lisu.

== Recreation ==
=== Shopping ===

There are three shopping malls operating in Chiang Mai, offering most big brands: Central Chiang Mai Airport, Central Chiang Mai and Maya Shopping Mall.

Shopping destinations geared towards tourists in Chiang Mai include the large and famous Night Bazaar for local arts and handicrafts. The night markets extend across several city blocks along footpaths, inside buildings and temple grounds, and in open squares.

The most famous handicraft and food market, called Tha Phae Walking Street or Chiang Mai Sunday Night Market, opens every Sunday at 5 PM until 10:30 PM for 1 kilometer on Rachadamnoen Road, the main street in the historical centre of the old city, which is then closed to motorised traffic. Every Saturday evening a handicraft market is held along Wua Lai Road, Chiang Mai&#x27;s silver street on the south side of the city beyond Chiang Mai Gate, which is then also closed to motorised traffic.

=== Attractions ===

* Chiang Mai Zoo, the oldest zoo in northern Thailand.
* Horse racing: Every Saturday starting at 12:30 there are races at Chiang Mai Racecourse. Betting is legal.
*Khlong Mae Kha: Both sides of the canal has been decorated with beautiful and neatly arranged concrete blocks, resembling the Otaru canal in Japan and Cheonggyecheon in South Korea.

== Transport ==

=== Roads ===
As population density continues to grow, greater pressure is placed upon the city&#x27;s transportation system. During peak hours, the road traffic is often badly congested. The city officials as well as researchers and experts have been trying to find feasible solutions to tackle the city&#x27;s traffic problems. Most of them agree that factors such as lack of public transport, increasing number of motor vehicles, inefficient land use plan and urban sprawl, have led to these problems. The locally preferred form of transport is personal motorbike and, increasingly, private car. Local public transport is via tuk-tuk, songthaew, bus, or rickshaw. New electric tuk-tuks were introduced into the city in June 2017.

=== Buses ===

A number of bus stations link the city to central, southeast, and northern Thailand. The central Chang Puak Terminal (north of Chiang Puak Gate) provides local services within Chiang Mai Province. The Chiang Mai Arcade bus terminal northeast of the city centre (which can be reached with a songthaew or tuk-tuk ride) provides services to over 20 other destinations in Thailand including Bangkok, Pattaya, Hua Hin, and Phuket. There are several services a day from Chiang Mai Arcade terminal to Mo Chit Station in Bangkok (a 10- to 12-hour journey).

Since December 2023, Chiang Mai offers a city wide bus system under the name RTC Chiang Mai City Bus, with three established lines starting and terminating at Chiang Mai Airport.

=== Rail systems ===

The state railway operates 10 trains a day to Chiang Mai railway station from Bangkok. Most journeys run overnight and take approximately 12–15 hours. Most trains offer first-class (private cabins) and second-class (seats fold out to make sleeping berths) service. Chiang Mai is the northern terminus of the Thai railway system.

The latest development is that Mass Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand (MRTA) has approved a draft decree on the light railway transit system project in Chiang Mai. The construction was set to begin in 2020 and be completed by 2027. It is believed that such a system would mitigate Chiang Mai&#x27;s traffic problems to a large degree.

=== Airports ===
Chiang Mai International Airport is the fourth busiest airport in Thailand and receives an average of 50 flights a day from Bangkok (25 from Suvarnabhumi and also 25 from Don Mueang, flight time about 1 hour 10 minutes) and also serves as a local hub for services to other northern cities such as Chiang Rai, Phrae, and Mae Hong Son. International services also connect Chiang Mai with other regional centers, including cities in other Asian countries. Planning is underway to renovate and expand the existing airport form 8 milion million annual passengers to 20 milion million annual passengers , and for a second airport with a capacity to serve 24 million annual passengers and 2rd runways and expected to be able to handle 32,000 tonnes of cargo.
