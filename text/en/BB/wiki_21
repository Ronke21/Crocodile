<text>Lyndon Hermyle LaRouche Jr. (September 8, 1922 – February 12, 2019) was an American political activist who founded the LaRouche movement and its main organization, the National Caucus of Labor Committees (NCLC). He was a prominent conspiracy theorist and perennial presidential candidate. He began in far-left politics in the 1940s and later supported the civil rights movement; however, in the 1970s, he moved to the far-right. His movement is sometimes described as, or likened to, a cult. Convicted of fraud, he served five years in prison from 1989 to 1994.

Born in Rochester, New Hampshire, LaRouche was drawn to socialist and Marxist movements in his twenties during World War II. In the 1950s, while a Trotskyist, he was also a management consultant in New York City. By the 1960s, he became engaged in increasingly smaller and more radical splinter groups. During the 1970s, he created the foundation of the LaRouche movement and became more engaged in conspiratorial beliefs and violent and illegal activities. Instead of the radical left, he embraced radical right politics and antisemitism. At various times, he alleged that he had been targeted for assassination by Queen Elizabeth II, Zionist mobsters, his own associates (who he said had been drugged and brainwashed by CIA and British spies), in addition to others.

It is estimated that the LaRouche movement never exceeded a few thousand members, but it had an outsize political influence, raising more than $200 million by one estimate, and running candidates in more than 4,000 elections in the 1980s. It was noted for disguising its candidates as conservative Democrats and harassing opponents. It reached its height in electoral success when Larouchite candidates won the Democratic primaries for the 1986 Illinois gubernatorial election and related state offices; this alarmed Democratic Party officials, whose national spokesman called the Larouchites &quot;kook fringe&quot;. The defeated mainstream Democratic candidates ran in the general election as members of the Illinois Solidarity Party; the Larouchite Democrats all finished a distant third. Later in the 1980s, as part of the LaRouche criminal trials, criminal investigations led to convictions of several LaRouche movement members, including LaRouche himself. He was sentenced to 15 years&#x27; imprisonment but served only five.

LaRouche was a perennial candidate for President of the United States. He ran in every election from 1976 to 2004 as a candidate of third parties established by members of his movement, peaking at around 78,000 votes in the 1984 United States presidential election. He also tried to gain the Democratic presidential nomination. In the  1996 Democratic Party presidential primaries, he received 5% of the total nationwide vote. In 2000, he received enough primary votes to qualify for delegates in some states, but the Democratic National Committee refused to seat his delegates and barred LaRouche from attending the Democratic National Convention.

==Early life==
LaRouche was born in Rochester, New Hampshire, the oldest of three children of Jessie Lenore ( Weir) and Lyndon H. LaRouche Sr. His paternal grandfather&#x27;s family emigrated to the United States from Rimouski, Quebec, whereas his maternal grandfather was born in Scotland. His father worked for the United Shoe Machinery Corporation in Rochester before the family moved to Lynn, Massachusetts.

His parents became Quakers after his father converted from Catholicism. They forbade him from fighting with other children, even in self-defense, which he said led to &quot;years of hell&quot; from bullies at school. As a result, he spent much of his time alone, taking long walks through the woods and identifying in his mind with great philosophers. He wrote that, between the ages of 12 and 14, he read philosophy extensively, embracing the ideas of Leibniz and rejecting those of Hume, Bacon, Hobbes, Locke, Berkeley, Rousseau, and Kant. He graduated from Lynn English High School in 1940. In the same year, the Lynn Quakers expelled his father from the group, for reportedly accusing other Quakers of misusing funds, while writing under the pen name Hezekiah Micajah Jones. LaRouche and his mother resigned in sympathy with his father.

===University studies, Marxism, marriage===

LaRouche attended Northeastern University in Boston and left in 1942. He later wrote that his teachers &quot;lacked the competence to teach me on conditions I was willing to tolerate&quot;. As a Quaker, he was a conscientious objector during World War II and joined a Civilian Public Service camp in lieu of military service. In 1944, he decided to enlist in the United States Army and served with the Medical Corps in India and Burma during the Burma campaign. At the end of the war, he was working as a clerk in the Ordnance Corps, and later described his decision to enlist as the most important decision of his life. In his 1988 autobiography, LaRouche said that being asked to express his views on the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt to a group of fellow G.I.s led him to define his &quot;principal lifelong political commitment, that the United States should take postwar world leadership in establishing a world order dedicated to promoting the economic development of what we call today &quot;developing nations&quot;.

LaRouche wrote that he discussed Marxism in the CO camp, and while traveling home on the SS &quot;General Bradley&quot; in 1946, he met Don Merrill, a fellow soldier, also from Lynn, who converted him to Trotskyism. Back in the U.S., he resumed his education at Northeastern University but dropped out. He returned to Lynn in 1948 and the next year joined the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) to recruit at the GE River Works there, adopting the name &quot;Lyn Marcus&quot; for his political work. He arrived in New York City in 1953, where he worked as a management consultant. In 1954 he married Janice Neuberger, a member of the SWP. Their son, Daniel, was born in 1956.

==Career==
===1960s===
====Teaching and the National Caucus of Labor Committees====

By 1961, the LaRouches were living on Central Park West in Manhattan, and LaRouche&#x27;s activities were mostly focused on his career and not on the SWP. He and his wife separated in 1963, and he moved into a Greenwich Village apartment with another SWP member, Carol Schnitzer, also known as Larrabee. In 1964 he began an association with an SWP faction called the Revolutionary Tendency, a faction later expelled from the SWP, and came under the influence of British Trotskyist leader Gerry Healy.

For six months, LaRouche worked with American Healyite leader Tim Wohlforth, who later wrote that LaRouche had a &quot;gargantuan ego&quot; and &quot;a marvelous ability to place any world happening in a larger context, which seemed to give the event additional meaning, but his thinking was schematic, lacking factual detail and depth.&quot; Leaving Wohlforth&#x27;s group, LaRouche briefly joined the rival Spartacist League before announcing his intention to build a new Fifth International.

In 1967, LaRouche began teaching classes on Marx&#x27;s dialectical materialism at New York City&#x27;s Free School, and attracted a group of students from Columbia University and the City College of New York, recommending that they read &quot;Das Kapital&quot;, as well as Hegel, Kant, and Leibniz. During the 1968 Columbia University protests, he organized his supporters under the name &quot;National Caucus of Labor Committees&quot; (NCLC). The aim of the NCLC was to win control of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) branchthe university&#x27;s main activist groupand build a political alliance between students, local residents, organized labor, and the Columbia faculty. By 1973, the NCLC had over 600 members in 25 citiesincluding West Berlin and Stockholmand produced what LaRouche&#x27;s biographer, Dennis King, called the most literate of the far-left papers, &quot;New Solidarity&quot;. The NCLC&#x27;s internal activities became highly regimented over the next few years. Members gave up their jobs and devoted themselves to the group and its leader, believing it would soon take control of America&#x27;s trade unions and overthrow the government.

===1970s===
====1971: Intelligence network====

Robert J. Alexander writes that LaRouche first established an NCLC &quot;intelligence network&quot; in 1971. Members all over the world sent information to NCLC headquarters, which would distribute the information via briefings and other publications. LaRouche organized the network as a series of news services and magazines, which critics say was done to gain access to government officials under press cover. The publications included &quot;Executive Intelligence Review&quot;, founded in 1974. Other periodicals under his aegis included &quot;New Solidarity&quot;, &quot;Fusion Magazine&quot;, &quot;21st Century Science and Technology&quot;, and &quot;Campaigner Magazine&quot;. His news services and publishers included American System Publications, Campaigner Publications, New Solidarity International Press Service, and The New Benjamin Franklin House Publishing Company. LaRouche acknowledged in 1980 that his followers impersonated reporters and others, saying it had to be done for his security. In 1982, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; sued New Solidarity International Press Service and Campaigner Publications for damages, alleging that members were impersonating its reporters in phone calls.

U.S. sources told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 1985 that the LaRouche organization had assembled a worldwide network of government and military contacts, and that his researchers sometimes supplied information to government officials. Bobby Ray Inman, the CIA&#x27;s deputy director in 1981 and 1982, said LaRouche and his wife had visited him, offering information about the West German Green Party. A CIA spokesman said LaRouche met Deputy Director John McMahon in 1983 to discuss one of LaRouche&#x27;s trips overseas. An aide to Deputy Secretary of State William Clark said when LaRouche&#x27;s associates discussed technology or economics, they made good sense and seemed qualified. Norman Bailey, formerly with the U.S. National Security Council, said in 1984 that LaRouche&#x27;s staff comprised &quot;one of the best private intelligence services in the world. ... They do know a lot of people around the world. They do get to talk to prime ministers and presidents.&quot; Several government officials feared a security leak from the government&#x27;s ties with the movement. According to critics, the supposed behind-the-scenes processes were more often flights of fancy than inside information. Douglas Foster wrote in &quot;Mother Jones&quot; in 1982 that the briefings consisted of disinformation, &quot;hate-filled&quot; material about enemies, phony letters, intimidation, fake newspaper articles, and dirty tricks campaigns. Opponents were accused of being gay or Nazis, or were linked to murders, which the movement called &quot;psywar techniques&quot;.

From the 1970s to the first decade of the 21st century, LaRouche founded several groups and companies. In addition to the National Caucus of Labor Committees, there was the Citizens Electoral Council (Australia), the National Democratic Policy Committee, the Fusion Energy Foundation, and the U.S. Labor Party. In 1984, he founded the Schiller Institute in Germany with his second wife, and three political parties therethe &quot;Europäische Arbeiterpartei&quot;, &quot;Patrioten für Deutschland&quot;, and &quot;Bürgerrechtsbewegung Solidarität&quot;and in 2000 the Worldwide LaRouche Youth Movement. His printing services included Computron Technologies, Computype, World Composition Services, and PMR Printing Company, Inc, or PMR Associates.

====1973: Political shift; &quot;Operation Mop-Up&quot;====
LaRouche wrote in his 1987 autobiography that violent altercations had begun in 1969 between his NCLC members and several New Left groups when Mark Rudd&#x27;s faction began assaulting LaRouche&#x27;s faction at Columbia University. Press accounts alleged that between April and September 1973, during what LaRouche called &quot;Operation Mop-Up&quot;, NCLC members began physically attacking members of leftist groups that LaRouche classified as &quot;left-protofascists&quot;; an editorial in LaRouche&#x27;s &quot;New Solidarity&quot; said of the Communist Party that the movement &quot;must dispose of this stinking corpse&quot;. Armed with chains, bats, and martial-art nunchuk sticks, NCLC members assaulted Communist Party, SWP, and Progressive Labor Party members and Black Power activists on the streets and during meetings. At least 60 assaults were reported. The operation ended when police arrested several of LaRouche&#x27;s followers; there were no convictions, and LaRouche maintained they had acted in self-defense. Journalist and LaRouche biographer Dennis King writes that the FBI may have tried to aggravate the strife, using measures such as anonymous mailings, to keep the groups at each other&#x27;s throats. LaRouche said he met representatives of the Soviet Union at the United Nations in 1974 and 1975 to discuss attacks by the Communist Party USA on the NCLC and propose a merger, but said he received no assistance from them. One FBI memo, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, proposes assisting the CPUSA in an investigation &quot;for the purpose of ultimately eliminating him [LaRouche] and the threat of the NCLC&quot; (see image to left).

LaRouche&#x27;s critics, such as King and Antony Lerman, allege that in 1973, with little warning, LaRouche adopted more extreme ideas, a process accompanied by a campaign of violence against his opponents on the left, and the development of conspiracy theories and paranoia about his personal safety. According to these accounts, he began to believe he was under threat of assassination from the Soviet Union, the CIA, Libya, drug dealers, and bankers. He also established a &quot;Biological Holocaust Task Force&quot;, which, according to LaRouche, analyzed the public health consequences of International Monetary Fund (IMF) austerity policies for impoverished nations in Africa, and predicted that epidemics of cholera as well as possibly entirely new diseases would strike Africa in the 1980s.

====1973: U.S. Labor Party====

LaRouche founded the U.S. Labor Party in 1973 as the political arm of the NCLC. At first, the party was &quot;preaching Marxist revolution&quot;; however, by 1977, it shifted from left-wing to right-wing politics. A two-part article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1979 by Howard Blum and Paul L. Montgomery alleged that LaRouche had turned the party (at that point with 1,000 members in 37 offices in North America, and 26 in Europe and Latin America) into an extreme-right, antisemitic organization, despite the presence of Jewish members. LaRouche denied the newspaper&#x27;s charges, and said he had filed a $100 million libel suit; his press secretary said the articles were intended to &quot;set up a credible climate for an assassination hit&quot;.

The &quot;Times&quot; alleged that members had taken courses in how to use knives and rifles; that a farm in upstate New York had been used for guerrilla training; and that several members had undergone a six-day anti-terrorist training course run by Mitchell WerBell III, an arms dealer and former member of the Office of Strategic Services, who said he had ties to the CIA. Journalists and publications the party regarded as unfriendly were harassed, and it published a list of potential assassins it saw as a threat. LaRouche expected members to devote themselves entirely to the party, place their savings and possessions at its disposal, and take out loans on its behalf. Party officials decided who each member should live with, and if someone left the movement, the remaining member was expected to live separately from the ex-member. LaRouche questioned spouses about their partner&#x27;s sexual habits, the &quot;Times&quot; said, and in one case reportedly ordered a member to stop having sex with his wife, because it was making him &quot;politically impotent&quot;.

====1973: &quot;Ego-stripping&quot; and &quot;brainwashing&quot; allegations====
LaRouche began writing in 1973 about the use of certain psychological techniques on recruits. In an article called &quot;Beyond Psychoanalysis&quot;, he wrote that a worker&#x27;s persona had to be stripped away to arrive at a state he called &quot;little me&quot;, from which it would be possible to &quot;rebuild their personalities around a new socialist identity&quot;, according to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the first such sessionwhich LaRouche called &quot;ego-stripping&quot;involved a German member, Konstantin George, in the summer of 1973. LaRouche said that during the session he discovered that a plot to assassinate him had been implanted in George&#x27;s mind.

He recorded sessions with a 26-year-old British member, Chris White, who had moved to England with LaRouche&#x27;s former partner, Carol Schnitzer. In December 1973 LaRouche asked the couple to return to the U.S. His followers sent tapes of the subsequent sessions with White to &quot;The New York Times&quot; as evidence of an assassination plot. According to the &quot;Times&quot;, &quot;[t]here are sounds of weeping, and vomiting on the tapes, and Mr. White complains of being deprived of sleep, food and cigarettes. At one point someone says &#x27;raise the voltage&#x27;, but [LaRouche] says this was associated with the bright lights used in the questioning rather than an electric shock.&quot; The &quot;Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Mr. White complains of a terrible pain in his arm, then LaRouche can be heard saying, &#x27;That&#x27;s not real. That&#x27;s in the program&#x27;.&quot; LaRouche told the newspaper White had been &quot;reduced to an eight-cycle infinite loop with look-up table, with homosexual bestiality&quot;. He said White had not been harmed and that a physiciana LaRouche movement memberhad been present throughout. White ended up telling LaRouche he had been programmed by the CIA and British intelligence to set up LaRouche for assassination by Cuban exile frogmen.

According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;brainwashing hysteria&quot; took hold of the movement. One activist said he attended meetings where members were writhing on the floor saying they needed de-programming. In two weeks in January 1974, the group issued 41 separate press releases about brainwashing. One activist, Alice Weitzman, expressed skepticism about the claims.

===1974: Contacts with far-right groups, intelligence gathering===
LaRouche established contacts with Willis Carto&#x27;s Liberty Lobby and elements of the Ku Klux Klan in 1974. Frank Donner and Randall Rothenberg wrote that he made successful overtures to the Liberty Lobby and George Wallace&#x27;s American Independent Party, adding that the &quot;racist&quot; policies of LaRouche&#x27;s U.S. Labor Party endeared it to members of the Ku Klux Klan. George Michael, in &quot;Willis Carto and the American Far Right&quot;, says that LaRouche shared with the Liberty Lobby&#x27;s Willis Carto an antipathy towards the Rockefeller family. The Liberty Lobby defended its alliance with LaRouche by saying the U.S. Labor Party had been able to &quot;confuse, disorient, and disunify the Left&quot;.

Gregory Rose, a former chief of counter-intelligence for LaRouche who became an FBI informant in 1973, said that while the LaRouche movement had extensive links to the Liberty Lobby, there was also copious evidence of a connection to the Soviet Union. George and Wilcox say neither connection amounted to muchthey assert that LaRouche was &quot;definitely not a Soviet agent&quot; and state that while the contact with the Liberty Lobby is often used to imply links&#x27; and &#x27;ties&#x27; between LaRouche and the extreme right&quot;, it was in fact transient and marked by mutual suspicion. The Liberty Lobby soon pronounced itself disillusioned with LaRouche, citing his movement&#x27;s adherence to &quot;basic socialist positions&quot; and his softness on &quot;the major Zionist groups&quot; as fundamental points of difference. According to George and Wilcox, American neo-Nazi leaders expressed misgivings over the number of Jews and members of other minority groups in his organization, and did not consider LaRouche an ally. George Johnson, in &quot;Architects of Fear&quot;, similarly states that LaRouche&#x27;s overtures to far right groups were pragmatic rather than sincere. A 1975 party memo spoke of uniting with these groups only to overthrow the established order, adding that once that goal had been accomplished, &quot;eliminating our right-wing opposition will be comparatively easy&quot;.

Howard Blum wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that, from 1976 onward, party members sent reports to the FBI and local police regarding members of left-wing organizations. In 1977, he wrote, commercial reports on U.S. anti-apartheid groups were prepared by LaRouche members for the South African government, student dissidents were reported to the Shah of Iran&#x27;s Savak secret police, and the anti-nuclear movement was investigated on behalf of power companies. Johnson says the intelligence network was made up of &quot;obnoxious devotees commandeering WATS lines and tricking bureaucrats into giving them information&quot;. By the late 1970s, members were exchanging almost daily information with Roy Frankhouser, a government informant and infiltrator of both far right and far left groups who was involved with the Ku Klux Klan and the American Nazi Party. The LaRouche organization believed Frankhouser to be a federal agent who had been assigned to infiltrate right-wing and left-wing groups, and that he had evidence that these groups were actually being manipulated or controlled by the FBI and other agencies. LaRouche and his associates considered Frankhouser to be a valuable intelligence contact, and took his links to extremist groups to be a cover for his intelligence work. Frankhouser played into these expectations, misrepresenting himself as a conduit for communications to LaRouche from &quot;Mr. Ed&quot;, an alleged CIA contact who did not exist in reality.

Blum wrote, at around this time, that LaRouche&#x27;s Computron Technologies Corporation included Mobil Oil and Citibank among its clients, that his World Composition Services had one of the most advanced typesetting complexes in the city and had the Ford Foundation among its clients, and that his PMR Associates produced the party&#x27;s publications and some high school newspapers.

Around the same time, according to Blum, LaRouche was telling his membership several times a year that he was being targeted for assassination, including by the Queen of the United Kingdom, Zionist mobsters, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Justice Department, and the Mossad. LaRouche sued the City of New York in 1974, saying the CIA and British spies had tortured and drugged his associates to brainwash his associates into killing him. According to &quot;The Patriot-News&quot; of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, LaRouche said he had been &quot;threatened by Communists, Zionists, narcotics gangsters, the Rockefellers and international terrorists.&quot; LaRouche later said:

====1975–1976: presidential campaign====

In March 1975, Clarence M. Kelley, director of the FBI, testified before the House Appropriations Committee that the NCLC was &quot;a violence-oriented organization of &#x27;revolutionary socialists&#x27; with a membership of nearly 1,000 in chapters in some 50 cities&quot;. He said that during the previous two years its members had been &quot;involved in fights, beatings, using drugs, kidnappings, brainwashings, and at least one shooting. They are reported to be armed, to have received defensive training such as karate, and to attend cadre schools and training schools to learn military tactics&quot;.

In 1975, under the name &quot;Lyn Marcus&quot;, LaRouche published &quot;Dialectical Economics: An Introduction to Marxist Political Economy&quot;, described by its only reviewer as &quot;the most peculiar and idiosyncratic&quot; introduction to economics he had ever seen. Mixing economics, history, anthropology, sociology and a surprisingly large helping of business administration, the work argued that most prominent Marxists had misunderstood Marx, and that bourgeois economics arose when philosophy took a wrong, reductionist turn under British empiricists like Locke and Hume.

In 1976, LaRouche campaigned for the first time in a presidential election as a U.S. Labor Party candidate, polling 40,043 votes (0.05%). It was the first of eight consecutive presidential elections in which he ran between 1976 and 2004. It enabled him to attract $5.9 million in federal matching funds; candidates seeking their party&#x27;s presidential nomination qualify for matching funds if they raise $5,000 in each of at least 20 states. His platform predicted financial disaster by 1980 accompanied by famine and the virtual extinction of the human race within 15 years, and proposed a debt moratorium; nationalization of banks; government investment in industry especially in the aerospace sector, and an &quot;International Development Bank&quot; to facilitate higher food production. When Legionnaires&#x27; disease appeared in the U.S. that year, he said it was a continuation of the swine flu outbreak, and that senators who opposed vaccination were suppressing the link as part of a &quot;genocidal policy&quot;.

His campaign included a paid half-hour television address, which allowed him to air his views before a national audience, something that became a regular feature of his later campaigns. There were protests about this, and about the NCLC&#x27;s involvement in public life generally. Writing in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Stephen Rosenfeld said LaRouche&#x27;s ideas belonged to the radical right, neo-Nazi fringe, and that his main interests lay in disruption and disinformation; Rosenfeld called the NCLC one of the &quot;chief polluters&quot; of political democracy. Rosenfeld argued that the press should be &quot;chary&quot; of offering them print or airtime: &quot;A duplicitous violence-prone group with fascistic proclivities should not be presented to the public, unless there is reason to present it in those terms.&quot; LaRouche wrote in 1999 that this comment had &quot;openly declared ... a policy of malicious lying&quot; against him.

====1977: Second marriage====
LaRouche married again in 1977. His wife, Helga Zepp, was then a leading activist in the West German branch of the movement. She went on to work closely with LaRouche for the rest of her career, standing for election in Germany in 1980 for his &quot;Europäische Arbeiterpartei&quot; (European Workers Party), and founding the Schiller Institute in Germany in 1984.

===1980s===
====National Democratic Policy Committee, &quot;October Surprise&quot; theory====
From the autumn of 1979, the LaRouche movement conducted most of its U.S. electoral activities as the National Democratic Policy Committee (NDPC), a political action committee. The name drew complaints from the Democratic Party&#x27;s Democratic National Committee. Democratic Party leaders refused to recognize LaRouche as a party member, or to seat the few delegates he received in his seven primary campaigns as a Democrat. In its 2019 obituary of LaRouche, &quot;New York&quot; magazine reported that LaRouche&#x27;s attempts to pose as a Democrat were originally an attempt at a spoiler operation to divide the opponents of Ronald Reagan.

LaRouche&#x27;s campaign platforms advocated a return to the Bretton Woods system, including a gold-based national and world monetary system; fixed exchange rates; and abolishing the International Monetary Fund. He supported the replacement of the central bank system, including the U.S. Federal Reserve System, with a &quot;national bank&quot;; a war on drug trafficking and prosecution of banks involved in money laundering; building a tunnel under the Bering Strait; the building of nuclear power plants; and a crash program to build particle-beam weapons and lasers, including support for elements of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). He opposed the Soviet Union and supported a military buildup to prepare for imminent war; supported the screening and quarantine of AIDS patients; and opposed environmentalism, deregulation, outcome-based education, and abortion:

In December 1980, LaRouche and his followers started what came to be known as the &quot;October Surprise&quot; allegation, namely that in October 1980 Ronald Reagan&#x27;s campaign staff conspired with the Iranian government during the Iran hostage crisis to delay the release of 52 American hostages held in Iran, with the aim of helping Reagan win the 1980 United States presidential election against Jimmy Carter. The Iranians had agreed to this, according to the theory, in exchange for future weapons sales from the Reagan administration. The first publication of the story was in LaRouche&#x27;s &quot;Executive Intelligence Review&quot; on December 2, 1980, followed by his &quot;New Solidarity&quot; on September 2, 1983, alleging that Henry Kissinger, one of LaRouche&#x27;s regular targets, had met Iran&#x27;s Ayatollah Beheshti in Paris, according to Iranian sources in Paris. The theory was later echoed by former Iranian President Abolhassan Banisadr and former Naval intelligence officer and National Security Council member Gary Sick.

====1983: Move from New York to Loudoun County====
&quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that LaRouche and his wife moved in August 1983 from New York to a 13-room Georgian mansion on a 250-acre section of the Woodburn Estate, near Leesburg, Loudoun County, Virginia. The property was owned at the time by a company registered in Switzerland. Companies associated with LaRouche continued to buy property in the area, including part of Leesburg&#x27;s industrial park, purchased by LaRouche&#x27;s Lafayette/Leesburg Ltd. Partnership to develop a printing plant and office complex.

Neighbors said they saw LaRouche guards in camouflage clothes carrying semi-automatic weapons, and the &quot;Post&quot; wrote that the house had sandbag-buttressed guard posts nearby, along with metal spikes in the driveway and concrete barriers on the road. One of his aides said LaRouche was safer in Loudoun County: &quot;The terrorist organizations which have targeted Mr. LaRouche do not have bases of operations in Virginia.&quot; LaRouche said his new home meant a shorter commute to Washington. A former associate said the move also meant his members would be more isolated from friends and family than they had been in New York. According to the &quot;Post&quot; in 2004, local people who opposed him for any reason were accused in LaRouche publications of being communists, homosexuals, drug pushers, and terrorists. He reportedly accused the Leesburg Garden Club of being a nest of Soviet sympathizers, and a local lawyer who opposed LaRouche on a zoning matter went into hiding after threatening phone calls and a death threat. In leaflets supporting his application of concealed weapons permits for his bodyguards in Leesburg, Virginia, he wrote:

Of LaRouche&#x27;s paramilitary security force, armed with semi-automatic weapons, a spokesperson said that it was necessary because LaRouche was the subject of &quot;assassination conspiracies&quot;.
====1984: Schiller Institute, television spots, contact with Reagan administration====

Helga Zepp-LaRouche founded the Schiller Institute in Germany in 1984. In the same year, LaRouche raised enough money to purchase 14 television spots, at $330,000 each, in which he called Walter Mondale—the Democratic Party&#x27;s presidential nominee—a Soviet agent of influence, triggering over 1,000 telephone complaints. On April 19, 1986, NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; aired a sketch satirizing the ads, portraying the Queen of the United Kingdom and Henry Kissinger as drug dealers. LaRouche received 78,773 votes in the 1984 presidential election.

In 1984, media reports stated that LaRouche and his aides had met Reagan administration officials, including Norman Bailey, senior director of international economic affairs for the National Security Council (NSC), and Richard Morris, special assistant to William P. Clark, Jr. There were also reported contacts with the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the CIA. The LaRouche campaign said the reporting was full of errors. In 1984 two Pentagon officials spoke at a LaRouche rally in Virginia; a Defense Department spokesman said the Pentagon viewed LaRouche&#x27;s group as a &quot;conservative group ... very supportive of the administration.&quot; White House spokesman Larry Speakes said the Administration was &quot;glad to talk to&quot; any American citizen who might have information. According to Bailey, the contacts were broken off when they became public. Three years later, LaRouche blamed his criminal indictment on the NSC, saying he had been in conflict with Oliver North over LaRouche&#x27;s opposition to the Nicaraguan Contras. According to a LaRouche publication, a court-ordered search of North&#x27;s files produced a May 1986 telex from Iran–Contra defendant General Richard Secord, discussing the gathering of information to be used against LaRouche. According to King, LaRouche&#x27;s &quot;Executive Intelligence Review&quot; was the first to report important details of the Iran–Contra affair, predicting that a major scandal was about to break months before mainstream media picked up on the story.

====Strategic Defense Initiative====
The LaRouche campaign supported Reagan&#x27;s Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). Dennis King wrote that LaRouche had been speculating about space-based weaponry as early as 1975. He set up the Fusion Energy Foundation, which held conferences and tried to cultivate scientists, with some success. In 1979, FEF representatives attended a Moscow conference on laser fusion. LaRouche began to promote the use of lasers and related technologies for both military and civilian purposes, calling for a &quot;revolution in machine tools.&quot;

According to King, LaRouche&#x27;s associates had for some years been in contact with members of the Reagan administration about LaRouche&#x27;s space-based weapons ideas. LaRouche proposed the development of defensive beam technologies as a policy that was in the interest of both the U.S. and the Soviet Union, as the alternative to an arms race in offensive weapons and as a generator of spin-off economic benefits. Between February 1982 and February 1983, with the NSC&#x27;s approval, LaRouche met with Soviet embassy representative Evgeny Shershnev to discuss the proposal. During this period, Soviet economists also began to study LaRouche&#x27;s economic forecasting model. But after Reagan&#x27;s public announcement of the SDI in March 1983, Soviet representatives broke off contact with LaRouche and his representatives.

Physicist Edward Teller, a proponent of SDI and X-ray lasers, told reporters in 1984 that he had been courted by LaRouche but had kept his distance. LaRouche began calling his plan the &quot;LaRouche-Teller proposal,&quot; though they had never met. Teller said LaRouche was &quot;a poorly informed man with fantastic conceptions.&quot;

LaRouche later attributed the collapse of the Soviet Union to its refusal to follow his advice to accept Reagan&#x27;s offer to share the technology. Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld reported in his 2011 memoir that at a 2001 dinner in Russia with leading officials, he was told by General Yuri Baluyevsky, then the second highest-ranking officer in the Russian military, that LaRouche was the brains behind SDI. Rumsfeld said he believed LaRouche had had no influence on the program, and surmised that Baluyevsky must have obtained the information off the Internet. In 2012 the former head of the Russian bureau of Interpol, General Vladimir Ovchinsky, also described LaRouche as the man who proposed the SDI.

====1984: NBC lawsuit====
In January 1984, NBC aired a news segment about LaRouche, and in March a &quot;First Camera&quot; report produced by Pat Lynch. The reports called LaRouche &quot;the leader of a violence-prone, anti-Semitic cult that smeared its opponents and sued its critics&quot;, as Lynch wrote in 1985 in the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot;. In interviews, former members of the movement gave details about their fundraising practices, and alleged that LaRouche had spoken about assassinating President Jimmy Carter. The reports said an investigation by the Internal Revenue Service would lead to an indictment, and quoted Irwin Suall, the Anti-Defamation League&#x27;s fact-finding director, who called LaRouche a &quot;small-time Hitler&quot;. After the broadcast, LaRouche members picketed NBC&#x27;s office carrying signs saying &quot;Lynch Pat Lynch,&quot; and the NBC switchboard said it received a death threat against her. Another NBC researcher said someone placed fliers around her parents&#x27; neighborhood saying she was running a call-girl ring from her parents&#x27; home. Lynch said LaRouche members began to impersonate her and her researchers in telephone calls, and called her &quot;Fat Lynch&quot; in their publications.

LaRouche filed a defamation suit against NBC and the ADL, arguing that the programs were the result of a deliberate campaign of defamation against him. The judge ruled that NBC need not reveal its sources, and LaRouche lost the case. NBC won a countersuit, the jury awarding the network $3 million in damages, later reduced to $258,459, for misuse of libel law, in what was called one of the more celebrated countersuits by a libel defendant. LaRouche failed to pay the damages, pleading poverty, which the judge described as &quot;completely lacking in credibility.&quot; LaRouche said he had been unaware since 1973 who paid the rent on the estate, or for his food, lodging, clothing, transportation, bodyguards, and lawyers. The judge fined him for failing to answer. After the judge signed an order to allow discovery of LaRouche&#x27;s personal finances, a cashier&#x27;s check was delivered to the court to end the case. When LaRouche appealed, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, rejecting his arguments, set forth a three-pronged test, later called the &quot;LaRouche test,&quot; to decide when anonymous sources must be named in libel cases.

====1985–1986: PANIC, LaRouche&#x27;s AIDS initiative====

LaRouche interpreted the AIDS pandemic as fulfillment of his 1973 prediction that an epidemic would strike humanity in the 1980s. According to Christopher Toumey, his subsequent campaign followed a familiar LaRouche pattern: challenging the scientific competence of government experts, and arguing that LaRouche had special scientific insights, and his own scientific associates were more competent than government scientists. LaRouche&#x27;s view of AIDS agreed with orthodox medicine in that HIV caused AIDS, but differed from it in arguing that HIV spread like the cold virus or malaria, by way of casual contact and insect biteswhich, if true, would make HIV-positive people extremely dangerous. He advocated testing anyone working in schools, restaurants, or healthcare, and quarantining those who tested positive. Some of LaRouche&#x27;s views on AIDS were developed by John Seale, a British venereological physician who proposed that AIDS was created in a Soviet laboratory. Seale&#x27;s highly speculative writings were published in three prestigious medical journals, lending these ideas some appearance of being hard science.

LaRouche and his associates devised a &quot;Biological Strategic Defense Initiative&quot; that would cost $100 billion per annum, which they said would have to be directed by LaRouche. Toumey writes that those opposing the program, such as the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control, were accused of &quot;viciously lying to the world,&quot; and of following an agenda of genocide and euthanasia. In 1986 LaRouche proposed that AIDS be added to California&#x27;s List of Communicable Diseases. Sponsored by his &quot;Prevent AIDS Now Initiative Committee&quot; (PANIC), Proposition 64or the &quot;LaRouche initiative&quot;qualified for the California ballot in 1986, with the required signature gatherers mostly paid for by LaRouche&#x27;s Campaigner Publications. Seale, presented as an AIDS expert by PANIC, supported the LaRouche initiative, but disagreed with several of LaRouche&#x27;s views, including that HIV could be spread by insects, and described the group&#x27;s political beliefs and conspiracy theories as &quot;rather odd&quot;. According to David Kirp, professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley, the proposal would have required that 300,000 people in the area with HIV or AIDS be reported to public health authorities; might have removed over 100,000 of them from their jobs in schools, restaurants and agriculture; and would have forced 47,000 children to stay away from school.

The proposal was opposed by leading scientists and local health officials as based on inaccurate scientific information and, as the public health schools put it, running &quot;counter to all public health principles.&quot; It was defeated, reintroduced two years later, and defeated again, with two million votes in favor the first time, and 1.7 million the second. AIDS became a leading plank in LaRouche&#x27;s platform during his 1988 presidential campaign.

====1986: Electoral success in Illinois; press conference allegations====

In March 1986, Mark Fairchild and Janice HartLaRouche National Democratic Policy Committee candidateswon the Democratic primary for statewide offices in Illinois, gaining national attention for LaRouche. The Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Adlai Stevenson III, withdrew his nomination rather than run on the same slate as LaRouche members, and told reporters the party was &quot;exploring every legal remedy to purge these bizarre and dangerous extremists from the Democratic ticket.&quot; A spokesman for the Democratic National Committee said it would have to do a better job of communicating to the electorate that LaRouche&#x27;s National Democratic Policy Committee was unrelated to the Democratic Party. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Democratic Party officials were trying to identify LaRouche candidates in order to alert voters, and asked the LaRouche organization to release a full list of its candidates.

A month later, LaRouche held a press conference to accuse the Soviet government, British government, drug dealers, international bankers, and journalists of being involved in multiple conspiracies. Flanked by bodyguards, he said: &quot;If Abe Lincoln were alive, he&#x27;d probably be standing up here with me today,&quot; and that there was no criticism of him that did not originate &quot;with the drug lobby or the Soviet operation ...&quot; He said he had been in danger from Soviet assassins for over 13 years, and had to live in safe houses. He refused to answer a question from an NBC reporter, saying &quot;How can I talk with a drug pusher like you?&quot; He called the leadership of the United States &quot;idiotic&quot; and &quot;berserk,&quot; and its foreign policy &quot;criminal or insane.&quot; He warned of the imminent collapse of the banking system and accused banks of laundering drug money. Asked about the movement&#x27;s finances, he said &quot;I don&#x27;t know. ... I&#x27;m not responsible, I&#x27;m not involved in that.&quot;

====1986–1988: Raids and criminal convictions====

In October 1986, hundreds of state and federal officers raided LaRouche offices in Virginia and Massachusetts. A federal grand jury indicted LaRouche and twelve of his associates on credit card fraud and obstruction of justice. The charges stated that they had attempted to defraud people of millions of dollars, including several elderly people, by borrowing money they did not intend to repay. LaRouche disputed the charges, alleging that they were politically motivated.

When LaRouche&#x27;s &quot;heavily fortified&quot; estate was surrounded, he at first warned law-enforcement officials not to arrest him, saying that any attempt to do so would be an attempt to kill him. A spokesman would not rule out the use of violence against officials in response. While surrounded, LaRouche sent a telegram to president Ronald Reagan saying that an attempt to arrest him &quot;would be an attempt to kill me. I will not submit passively to such an arrest, ... I will defend myself.&quot;

In 1987, a number of LaRouche entities, including the Fusion Energy Foundation, were taken over through an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding. The government&#x27;s use of a sealed order in this proceeding was regarded as a rare legal maneuver.

On December 16, 1988, LaRouche was convicted of conspiracy to commit mail fraud involving more than $30 million in defaulted loans; eleven counts of actual mail fraud involving $294,000 in defaulted loans; and a single count of conspiring to defraud the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. He was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison, but was released on parole after serving five years on January 26, 1994.

Thirteen associates were sentenced to prison terms ranging from one month to 77 years for mail fraud and conspiracy.

The trial judge called LaRouche&#x27;s claim of a political vendetta &quot;arrant nonsense&quot;, and said &quot;the idea that this organization is a sufficient threat to anything that would warrant the government bringing a prosecution to silence them just defies human experience.&quot;

Defense lawyers filed unsuccessful appeals that challenged the conduct of the grand jury, the contempt fines, the execution of the search warrants, and various trial procedures. At least ten appeals were heard by the United States Court of Appeals, and three were heard by the U.S. Supreme Court.

Former Attorney General Ramsey Clark joined the defense team for two appeals, writing that the case involved &quot;a broader range of deliberate and systematic misconduct and abuse of power over a longer period of time in an effort to destroy a political movement and leader, than any other federal prosecution in my time or to my knowledge.&quot;

In his 1988 autobiography, LaRouche says the raid on his operation was the work of Raisa Gorbachev. In an interview that same year, he said that the Soviet Union opposed him, because he had invented the Strategic Defense Initiative. &quot;The Soviet government hated me for it. Gorbachev also hated my guts and called for my assassination and imprisonment and so forth.&quot; He asserted that he had survived these threats, because he had been protected by unnamed U.S. government officials. &quot;Even when they don&#x27;t like me, they consider me a national asset, and they don&#x27;t like to have their national assets killed.&quot;

LaRouche received 25,562 votes in the 1988 presidential election.

====1989: Musical interests and Verdi tuning initiative====
LaRouche had an interest in classical music up to the period of Brahms. A motto of LaRouche&#x27;s European Workers&#x27; Party is &quot;Think like Beethoven&quot;; movement offices typically include a piano and posters of German composers, and members are known for their choral singing at protest events and for using satirical lyrics tailored to their targets. LaRouche abhorred popular music; he said in 1980, &quot;Rock was not an accidental thing. This was done by people who set out in a deliberate way to subvert the United States. It was done by British intelligence,&quot; and wrote that the Beatles were &quot;a product shaped according to British Psychological Warfare Division specifications.&quot;

LaRouche movement members have protested at performances of Richard Wagner&#x27;s operas, denouncing Wagner as an anti-Semite who found favor with the Nazis, and called a conductor &quot;satanic&quot; because he played contemporary music.

In 1989, LaRouche advocated that classical orchestras should use a concert pitch based on A above middle C (A4) tuned to 432 Hz, which the Schiller Institute called the &quot;Verdi pitch&quot;, a pitch that Verdi had suggested as optimal, though he also composed and conducted in other pitches such as the French official &quot;diapason normal&quot; of 435 Hz, including his &quot;Requiem&quot; in 1874.

The Schiller Institute initiative attracted support from more than 300 opera stars, including Joan Sutherland, Plácido Domingo, and Luciano Pavarotti, who according to &quot;Opera Fanatic&quot; may not have been aware of LaRouche&#x27;s politics. A spokesman for Domingo said Domingo had simply signed a questionnaire, had not been aware of its origins, and would not agree with LaRouche&#x27;s politics. Renata Tebaldi and Piero Cappuccilli, who were running for the European Parliament on LaRouche&#x27;s &quot;Patriots for Italy&quot; platform, attended Schiller Institute conferences as featured speakers. The discussions led to debates in the Italian parliament about reinstating &quot;Verdi&quot; legislation. LaRouche gave an interview to National Public Radio on the initiative from prison. The initiative was opposed by the editor of &quot;Opera Fanatic&quot;, Stefan Zucker, who objected to the establishment of a &quot;pitch police,&quot; and argued that LaRouche was using the issue to gain credibility.

===1990s===
====Imprisonment, release on parole, attempts at exoneration, visits to Russia====
LaRouche began his sentence in 1989, serving it at the Federal Medical Center in Rochester, Minnesota. From there he ran for Congress in 1990, seeking to represent the 10th District of Virginia, but he received less than one percent of the vote. He ran for president again in 1992 with James Bevel as his running mate, a civil rights activist who had represented the LaRouche movement in its pursuit of the Franklin child prostitution ring allegations. It was only the second-ever campaign for president from prison. He received 26,334 votes, standing again as the &quot;Economic Recovery&quot; party. For a time he shared a cell with televangelist Jim Bakker. Bakker later wrote of his astonishment at LaRouche&#x27;s detailed knowledge of the Bible. According to Bakker, LaRouche received a daily intelligence report by mail, and at times had information about news events days before they happened. Bakker also wrote that LaRouche believed their cell was bugged. In Bakker&#x27;s view, &quot;to say LaRouche was a little paranoid would be like saying that the &quot;Titanic&quot; had a little leak.&quot;

Viktor Kuzin, a member of the Moscow City Council and a founder of the Democratic Union in Russia, travelled to Minnesota in 1993 to meet LaRouche in prison, and afterwards participated in international campaigns to exonerate LaRouche. An advertisement calling for exoneration was published in several U.S. newspapers, signed by Kuzin, Civil Rights attorney J. L. Chestnut, former Ugandan president Godfrey Binaisa, and others. Chestnut was interviewed in the &quot;Tuscaloosa News&quot; saying that when he met LaRouche, &quot;I told him that he might as well be black and in Alabama.&quot;

The exoneration campaigns garnered the support of a number of State Representatives and State Senators in the U.S., as well as a former justice of the Washington State Supreme Court.

LaRouche was released on parole in January 1994, and returned to Loudoun County. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that he would be supervised by parole and probation officers until January 2004. Also in 1994, his followers joined members of the Nation of Islam to blame the Anti-Defamation League for what they alleged were crimes and conspiracies against African Americans, reportedly one of several such meetings since 1992.

Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark wrote a letter in 1995 to then-Attorney General Janet Reno in which he said that the case against LaRouche involved &quot;a broader range of deliberate and systematic misconduct and abuse of power over a longer period of time in an effort to destroy a political movement and leader, than any other federal prosecution in my time or to my knowledge&quot;. He asserted that, &quot;The government, ex parte, sought and received an order effectively closing the doors of these publishing businesses, all of which were involved in First Amendment activities, effectively preventing the further repayment of their debts.&quot; He called the convictions &quot;a tragic miscarriage of justice which at this time can only be corrected by an objective review and courageous action by the Department of Justice&quot;. The LaRouche movement organized two panels to review the cases: the Curtis Clark Commission, and the Mann-Chestnut hearings.

Beginning in 1994, LaRouche made numerous visits to Russia, participating in conferences of the Vernadsky State Geological Museum of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS), the RAS Institute of the Far East, and other places. He addressed seminars at the RAS Institute of Economics, the RAS Institute of Oriental Studies. He spoke at hearings in the State Duma of the Russian Federation on measures to ensure the development of the Russian economy at the point of destabilization of the world financial system. Two of his books were translated into Russian.

On September 18, 1996, a full-page advertisement appeared in the &quot;New Federalist&quot;, a LaRouche publication, as well as &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;Roll Call&quot;. Entitled &quot;Officials Call for LaRouche&#x27;s Exoneration&quot;, its signatories included Arturo Frondizi, former president of Argentina; figures from the 1960s American civil rights movement such as Rosa Parks, Amelia Boynton Robinson (a leader of the Larouche-affiliated Schiller Institute), and James Bevel (a Larouche movement participant); former Minnesota Senator and Democratic presidential candidate Eugene McCarthy; Mervyn Dymally, who chaired the Congressional Black Caucus; and artists such as classical vocalist William Warfield and violinist Norbert Brainin, former 1st Violin of the Amadeus Quartet.

In 1996, LaRouche was invited to speak at a convention organized by the Nation of Islam&#x27;s Louis Farrakhan and Ben Chavis, then of the National African American Leadership Summit. As soon as he began speaking, he was booed off the stage.

In the 1996 Democratic Party presidential primaries, he received enough votes in Louisiana and Virginia to get one delegate from each state, but before the primaries began, the Democratic National Committee chair, Donald Fowler, ruled that LaRouche was not a &quot;bona fide Democrat&quot; because of his &quot;expressed political beliefs ... which are explicitly racist and anti-Semitic,&quot; and because of his &quot;past activities, including exploitation of and defrauding contributors and voters.&quot; Fowler instructed state parties to disregard votes for LaRouche.

LaRouche opposed attempts to impeach President Bill Clinton, charging it was a plot by the British Intelligence to destabilize the U.S. government. In 1996 he called for the impeachment of Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge.

Efforts to clear LaRouche&#x27;s name continued, including in Australia, where the Parliament acknowledged receipt of 1,606 petition signatures in 1998.

In 1999, China&#x27;s press agency, the Xinhua News Agency, reported that LaRouche had criticized the Cox Report, a congressional investigation that accused the Chinese of stealing U.S. nuclear weapons secrets, calling it a &quot;scientifically illiterate hoax.&quot; On October 13, 1999, during a press conference to announce his plans to run for president, he predicted the collapse of the world&#x27;s financial system, saying, &quot;There&#x27;s nothing like it in this century. ... it is systematic and therefore inevitable.&quot; He said the U.S. and other nations had built the &quot;biggest financial bubble in all history,&quot; which was close to bankruptcy.

===2000s===
====2000–2003: Worldwide LaRouche Youth Movement, September 11 attacks, presidential run====
LaRouche founded the Worldwide LaRouche Youth Movement (WLYM) in 2000, saying in 2004 that it had hundreds of members in the U.S. and a lesser number overseas. During the Democratic primaries in June 2000, he received 53,280 votes, or 22% of the total, in Arkansas. Despite finishing above the 15% threshold needed to obtain delegates, LaRouche was denied any delegates and was barred from attending the 2000 Democratic National Convention.

In 2002, LaRouche&#x27;s &quot;Executive Intelligence Review&quot; argued that the September 11 attacks in 2001 had been an &quot;inside job&quot; and &quot;attempted coup d&#x27;etat&quot;, and that Iran was the first country to question it. The article received wide coverage in Iran, and was cited by senior Iranian government officials, including Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Hassan Rouhani. Mahmoud Alinejad wrote that, in a subsequent telephone interview with the &quot;Voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran&quot;, LaRouche said the attacks had been organized by rogue elements inside the U.S., aiming to use the incident to promote a war against Islam, and that Israel was a dictatorial regime prepared to commit Nazi-style crimes against the Palestinians.

In 2003, LaRouche was living in a &quot;heavily guarded&quot; rented house in Round Hill, Loudoun County, Virginia.

LaRouche again entered the primary elections for the Democratic Party&#x27;s nomination in 2004, setting a record for the number of consecutive presidential campaigns; Democratic Party officials did not allow him to participate in candidate forum debates. He did not run in 2008.

As during the preceding decade, LaRouche and his followers denied that human civilization had harmed the environment through DDT, chlorofluorocarbons, or carbon dioxide. According to Chip Berlet, &quot;Pro-LaRouche publications have been at the forefront of denying the reality of global warming&quot;.

====2003–2012: Overseas press coverage, financial crisis====

Iqbal Qazwini wrote in the Arabic-language daily &quot;Asharq Al-Awsat&quot; in 2003 that LaRouche was one of the first to predict the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1988 and German reunification. He said LaRouche had urged the West to pursue a policy of economic cooperation similar to the Marshall Plan for the advancement of the economy of the socialist countries. According to Qazwini, recent years have seen a proliferation of LaRouche&#x27;s ideas in China and South Asia. Qazwini referred to him as the spiritual father of the revival of the new Silk Road or Eurasian Landbridge, which aims to link the continents through a network of ground transportation.

In 2005, the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; of China covered LaRouche&#x27;s economic forecasts and published an eight-part interview with him; the interviewer wrote that LaRouche was &quot;quite famous in mainland China today&quot;.

In 2007, LaRouche began a national lobbying campaign to restore the Glass-Steagall Act, saying that it would be possible to save the U.S. banking system by reorganizing it under bankruptcy protection. Also in 2007, he proposed a &quot;Homeowners and Bank Protection Act&quot;. This called for the establishment of a federal agency that would &quot;place federal- and state-chartered banks under protection, freeze all existing home mortgages for a period of time, adjust mortgage values to fair prices, restructure existing mortgages at appropriate interest rates, and write off speculative debt obligations of mortgage-backed securities&quot;. The bill envisioned a foreclosure moratorium, allowing homeowners to make the equivalent of rental payments for an interim period, and an end to bank bailouts, forcing banks to reorganize under bankruptcy laws. In spring 2007 he was an honorary foreign guest at a ceremony in honor of the 80th birthday of Stanislav Menshikov at the Russian Academy of Sciences.

====2009: U.S. health care reform====

During the discussion of U.S. health care reform in 2009, LaRouche advocated a single-payer health care bill and took exception to what he described as President Barack Obama&#x27;s proposal that &quot;independent boards of doctors and health care experts [should] make the life-and-death decisions of what care to provide, and what not, based on cost-effectiveness criteria.&quot; LaRouche said the proposed boards would amount to the same thing as the Nazis&#x27; Action T4 euthanasia program. A press release from his political action committee asserted: &quot;Lyndon LaRouche and the LaRouchePAC are the source of the campaign to expose the Obama ‘health care’ policy as modeled on that of Hitler in 1939.&quot;

Images at tables of volunteers compared Obama to Adolf Hitler, and at least one had a picture of Obama with a Hitler-style mustache. In Seattle, police were called twice in response to people threatening to attack the volunteers. During one widely reported public meeting, Congressman Barney Frank called the images &quot;vile, contemptible nonsense.&quot;

==Ideology and beliefs==
University of Notre Dame political philosophers Catherine Zuckert and Michael Zuckert write of LaRouche that &quot;[I]t must be nearly unique in American politics that a presidential candidate ... makes the interpretation of Plato a major issue in his campaign.&quot;

According to George Johnson, LaRouche saw history as a battle between Platonists, who believe in absolute truth, and Aristotelians, who rely on empirical data. Johnson characterizes LaRouche&#x27;s views as follows: the Platonists include figures such as Beethoven, Mozart, Shakespeare, Leonardo da Vinci, and Leibniz. LaRouche believed that many of the world&#x27;s ills result from the dominance of Aristotelianism as embraced by the empirical philosophers (such as Hobbes, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume), leading to a culture that favors the empirical over the metaphysical, embraces moral relativism, and seeks to keep the general population uninformed. Industry, technology, and classical music should be used to enlighten the world, LaRouche argued, whereas the Aristotelians use psychotherapy, drugs, rock music, jazz, environmentalism, and quantum theory to bring about a new Dark Age in which the world will be ruled by oligarchs. Left and right are false distinctions for LaRouche; what matters is the Platonic versus Aristotelian outlook, a position that has led him to form relationships with groups as disparate as farmers, nuclear engineers, Black Muslims, Teamsters, and anti-abortion advocates.

In &quot;Architects of Fear&quot; (1983), Johnson compares LaRouche&#x27;s view to an Illuminati conspiracy theory; Johnson writes that after he wrote about LaRouche in &quot;The Minneapolis Star&quot;, LaRouche&#x27;s followers denounced him as part of a conspiracy of elitists that began in ancient Egypt. But according to LaRouche, Aristotelians are not necessarily in communication or coordination with one another: &quot;From their standpoint, [they] are proceeding by instinct,&quot; LaRouche said. &quot;If you&#x27;re asking how their policy is developedif there is an inside group sitting down and making plansno, it doesn&#x27;t work that way ... History doesn&#x27;t function quite that consciously.&quot;

In 2011, Stephen E. Adkins&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedia of Right-Wing Extremism In Modern American History&quot; called LaRouche &quot;the leading neo-fascist politician in the United States&quot;.

==Controversy==

LaRouche was described as having &quot;fascistic tendencies&quot;, taking positions on the far right (despite his self-identification with the left and some left-wing policies), and creating disinformation.

===Designation as a conspiracy theorist===
LaRouche was commonly regarded as a conspiracy theorist: for example, in his Fox News obituary. An article in the Southern Poverty Law Center website names him as &quot;a fringe ideologue and conspiracy theorist whom Chip Berlet, senior analyst at Political Research Associates and an expert on the radical right calls &quot;the man who brought us fascism wrapped in an American flag&quot;. An NPR obituary is titled &quot;Conspiracy Theorist And Frequent Presidential Candidate Lyndon LaRouche Dies At 96&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; obituary reports he was &quot;often described as an extremist crank and fringe figure&quot; and that he &quot;built a worldwide following based on conspiracy theories, economic doom, anti-Semitism, homophobia and racism&quot;.

===Allegations of antisemitism===
Beginning in the mid-1970s, allegations began to appear saying that LaRouche had fascist and antisemitic tendencies.

In 1977, LaRouche married his second wife, Helga Zepp-LaRouche, a German 27 years younger than he. Her 1984 book, &quot;The Hitler Book&quot;, argues that &quot;We need a movement that can finally free Germany from the control of the Versailles and Yalta treaties, thanks to which we have staggered from one catastrophe to another for an entire century.&quot; Helga founded the Schiller Institute, which has been described as promoting antisemitic conspiracy theories by the &quot;Berliner Zeitung&quot; and Political Research Associates, a nonprofit research group that studies right-wing, white supremacist, and militia groups.

LaRouche said he was anti-Zionist, not antisemitic. When the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) accused LaRouche of antisemitism in 1979, he filed a $26-million libel suit; the case failed when Justice Michael Dontzin of the New York Supreme Court ruled that it was fair comment and that the facts &quot;reasonably give rise&quot; to that description. LaRouche started a campaign against the ADL and set up a group called &quot;The Provisional Committee to Clean Up B&#x27;nai Brith&quot;.

LaRouche said in 1986 that descriptions of him as a neo-fascist or anti-Semite stemmed from &quot;the drug lobby or the Soviet operationwhich is sometimes the same thing&quot;, and in 2006 wrote that &quot;religious and racial hatred, such as antisemitism, or hatred against Islam, or, hatred of Christians, is, on record of known history, the most evil expression of criminality to be seen on the planet today.&quot; Antony Lerman wrote in 1988 that LaRouche used &quot;the British&quot; as a code word for &quot;Jews&quot;, a theory also propounded by Dennis King, author of &quot;Lyndon LaRouche and the New American Fascism&quot; (1989). George Johnson argued that King&#x27;s presentation failed to take into account that several members of LaRouche&#x27;s inner circle were Jewish. Daniel Pipes wrote in 1997 that LaRouche&#x27;s references to the British really were to the British, though he agreed that an alleged British–Jewish alliance lay at the heart of LaRouche&#x27;s conspiracism.

As of 2016, the Jewish Virtual Library states that &quot;The international organization run by Lyndon LaRouche is a major source of such masked antisemitic theories globally. In the U.S. the LaRouchites spread these conspiracy theories in an alliance with aides to Minister Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam. A series of LaRouchite pamphlets calls the neoconservative movement the &#x27;Children of Satan&#x27;, which links Jewish neo-conservatives to the historic rhetoric of the blood libel.&quot;

===Allegations of racism===
Manning Marable of Columbia University wrote in 1998 that LaRouche tried in the mid-1980s to build bridges to the black community. Marable argued that most of the community was not fooled and quoted the A. Philip Randolph Institute, an organization for African American trade unionists, declaring that &quot;LaRouche appeals to fear, hatred and ignorance. He seeks to exploit and exacerbate the anxieties and frustrations of Americans by offering an array of scapegoats and enemies: Jews, Zionists, international bankers, blacks, labor unionsmuch the way Hitler did in Germany.&quot; During LaRouche&#x27;s slander suit against NBC in 1984, Roy Innis, leader of the Congress of Racial Equality, took the stand for LaRouche as a character witness, stating under oath that LaRouche&#x27;s views on racism were &quot;consistent with his own.&quot; Asked whether he had seen any indication of racism in LaRouche&#x27;s associates, he replied that he had not.

===Disputed record as economist and forecaster===
LaRouche material frequently acclaims him as the world&#x27;s greatest economist and the world&#x27;s most successful forecaster. For example, his book title &quot;The Economics of the Noösphere: Why Lyndon LaRouche Is the World&#x27;s Most Successful Economic Forecaster of the Past Four Decades&quot;. However, a website of disgruntled ex-movement leaders lists incorrect predictions of sudden world economic collapse, war or depression in 1956, 1961–1970, 1972, 1975–1992, and 1994–2011.

Apart from the numerous failed predictions are claimed some successful predictions or proposals: the eventual reunification of Germany, the Star Wars initiative, the New Silk Road (claimed as a precursor to the Chinese One Belt One Road initiative.)

==Movement==

Estimates of the size of LaRouche&#x27;s movement have varied over the years; most say there is a core membership of 500 to 2,000. The estimated 600 members in 1978 paid monthly dues of $24. Johnson wrote in 1983 that both the Fusion Energy Foundation and the National Democratic Policy Committee had attracted some 20,000 members, as well as 300,000 magazine subscribers.

According to Christopher Toumey, LaRouche&#x27;s charismatic authority within the movement was grounded on members&#x27; belief that he possessed a unique level of insight and expertise. He identified an emotionally charged issue, conducted in-depth research into it, and then proposed a simplistic solution, which usually involved restructuring of the economy or national security apparatus. He and the membership portrayed anyone opposing him as immoral and part of the conspiracy.

===Description as a cult===
The LaRouche movement has been described as a cult or cult-like by critics and anti-cult organizations.

A 1987 article by John Mintz in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that members of the LaRouche movement lived hand-to-mouth in crowded apartments, with their basic needs paid for by the movement. They worked raising money or selling newspapers for LaRouche, doing research for him, or singing in a group choir, spending almost every waking hour together.

The group is known for its caustic attacks on opponents and former members. It has justified what it calls &quot;psywar techniques&quot; as necessary to shake people up; Johnson in 1983 quoted a LaRouche associate: &quot;We&#x27;re not very nice, so we&#x27;re hated. Why be nice? It&#x27;s a cruel world. We&#x27;re in a war and the human race is up for grabs&quot;. Charles Tate, a former LaRouche associate, told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 1987 that members see themselves as exempt from the ordinary laws of society: &quot;They feel that the continued existence of the human race is totally dependent on what they do in the organization, that nobody would be here without LaRouche. They feel justified in a peculiar way doing anything whatsoever.&quot;

==Death==
LaRouche&#x27;s death was announced on the website of one of his organizations. He died on February 12, 2019, at age 96. Neither the place nor cause of his death was specified.

<text>Blackbox is a free and open-source stacking window manager for the X Window System.

Blackbox has specific design goals, and some functionality is provided only through other applications. One example is the bbkeys hotkey application.

Blackbox is written in C++ and contains completely original code. It was created by Bradley T. Hughes and is available under the MIT License. Blackbox has compliance with the Extended Window Manager Hints specification.

The original author seems to have ceased updating the repository with the exception of a minor fix of compilation problems in 2015, leaving the last original version at 0.70.1. However an actively maintained fork by Brian Bidulock has been picked up by several Linux distributions in its place, and it is featured in pkgsrc. Despite that, some other Linux distributions still use the original source code, as does FreeBSD.

== Features ==
Features of the Blackbox window manager include:
* A stacking window manager
* Written in C++
* Freely available under the MIT license
* Compliance with the Extended Window Manager Hints Specification
* Title bars have minimize, maximize, and close buttons
* Support for simple themes
* Support for color changes
* No support for desktop shortcuts
* Compatibility with both KDE and GNOME

== Related projects ==
There are a number of other window manager forks of Blackbox:

* Fluxbox
* Hackedbox
* Openbox (until version 3.0)

=== Windows shell replacements ===
Although they do not share the same codebase, these projects are also inspired by Blackbox.

* BB4Win (the first and most prominent clone/port of Blackbox on Windows)
* bbLean 
* xoblite (has releases from 2021)
* bbZero (a branch of bbLean)

<doc id="229266" wikidata="Q553196" url="?curid=229266" title="Irving Kristol">
<text>Irving William Kristol (; January 22, 1920 – September 18, 2009) was an American journalist and writer. As a founder, editor, and contributor to various magazines, he played an influential role in the intellectual and political culture of the latter half of the twentieth century. He was dubbed the &quot;godfather of neoconservatism&quot;. After his death, he was described by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as being &quot;perhaps the most consequential public intellectual of the latter half of the century&quot;. He is the father of political writer Bill Kristol. 

== Early life and education ==
Kristol was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of non-observant Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe, Bessie (Mailman) and Joseph Kristol. He graduated from Boys High School in Brooklyn, New York in 1936 and received his B.A. from the City College of New York in 1940, where he majored in history. In college he was a member of the Young People&#x27;s Socialist League and was part of a small but vocal group of Trotskyist anti-Soviets who later became known as the New York Intellectuals. It was at these meetings that Kristol met historian Gertrude Himmelfarb, whom he married in 1942. They had two children, Elizabeth Nelson and Bill Kristol. During World War II, he served in Europe in the 12th Armored Division as a combat infantryman.

== Career ==

Kristol was affiliated with the Congress for Cultural Freedom. He wrote in &quot;Commentary&quot; magazine from 1947 to 1952 under the editor Elliot E. Cohen (not to be confused with Eliot A. Cohen, a current &quot;Commentary&quot; contributor). With Stephen Spender, he was co-founder of and contributor to the British-based &quot;Encounter&quot; from 1953 to 1958; editor of &quot;The Reporter&quot; from 1959 to 1960. He also was the executive vice-president of the publishing house Basic Books from 1961 to 1969, the Henry Luce Professor of Urban Values at New York University from 1969 to 1987, and co-founder and co-editor (first with Daniel Bell and then Nathan Glazer) of &quot;The Public Interest&quot; from 1965 to 2002. He was the founder and publisher of &quot;The National Interest&quot; from 1985 to 2002. Following &quot;Ramparts&quot;″ publication of information showing Central Intelligence Agency funding of the Congress for Cultural Freedom, which was widely reported elsewhere, Kristol left in the late 1960s and became affiliated with the American Enterprise Institute.

Kristol was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and a fellow emeritus at the American Enterprise Institute (having been an associate fellow from 1972, a senior fellow from 1977 and the John M. Olin Distinguished Fellow from 1988 to 1999). As a member of the board of contributors of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, he contributed a monthly column from 1972 to 1997. He served on the Council of the National Endowment for the Humanities from 1972 to 1977.

In 1978, Kristol and William E. Simon founded The Institute For Education Affairs, which as a result of a merger with the Madison Center became the Madison Center for Educational Affairs in 1990.

== Death ==
Kristol died from complications of lung cancer, aged 89, on September 18, 2009, at the Capital Hospice in Falls Church, Virginia.

==Ideas==

During the late 1960s up until the 1970s, neoconservatives were worried about the Cold War and that its liberalism was turning into radicalism, thus many neoconservatives including Irving Kristol, Norman Podhoretz and Daniel Patrick Moynihan wanted Democrats to continue on a strong anti-communist foreign policy. This foreign policy was to use Soviet human rights violations to attack the Soviet Union. This later led to Nixon&#x27;s policies called détente. Kristol did not believe that the same civil liberties should be granted to communists because it would be like paying &quot;a handsome salary to someone pledged to his liquidation&quot;.

In 1973, Michael Harrington coined the term, &quot;neo-conservatism&quot;, to describe those liberal intellectuals and political philosophers who were disaffected with the political and cultural attitudes dominating the Democratic Party and were moving toward a new form of conservatism. Intended by Harrington as a pejorative term, it was accepted by Kristol as an apt description of the ideas and policies exemplified by &quot;The Public Interest&quot;. Unlike liberals, for example, neo-conservatives rejected most of the Great Society programs sponsored by Lyndon B. Johnson and, unlike traditional conservatives, they supported the more limited welfare state instituted by Franklin D. Roosevelt.

In February 1979, Kristol was featured on the cover of &quot;Esquire&quot;. The caption identified him as &quot;the godfather of the most powerful new political force in America – Neo-conservatism&quot;. That year also saw the publication of the book, &quot;The Neo-conservatives: The Men Who Are Changing America&#x27;s Politics&quot;. Like Harrington, the author, Peter Steinfels, was critical of neo-conservatism, but he was impressed by its growing political and intellectual influence. Kristol&#x27;s response appeared under the title &quot;Confessions of a True, Self-Confessed – Perhaps the Only – &#x27;Neo-conservative&#x27;&quot;.

Neo-conservatism, Kristol maintained, is not an ideology but a &quot;persuasion&quot;, a way of thinking about politics rather than a compendium of principles and axioms. It is classical, rather than romantic, in temperament and practical and anti-utopian in policy. One of Kristol&#x27;s most well-known quips defines a neo-conservative as &quot;a liberal who has been mugged by reality&quot;. These concepts lie at the core of neo-conservative philosophy to this day.

While propounding the virtues of supply-side economics as the basis for the economic growth that is &quot;a &quot;sine qua non&quot; for the survival of a modern democracy&quot;, he also insists that any economic philosophy has to be enlarged by &quot;political philosophy, moral philosophy, and even religious thought&quot;, which were as much the &quot;sine qua non&quot; for a modern democracy.

One of his early books, &quot;Two Cheers for Capitalism&quot;, asserts that capitalism, or more precisely, bourgeois capitalism, is worthy of two cheers. One cheer because &quot;it works, in a quite simple, material sense&quot; by improving the conditions of people; and a second cheer because it is &quot;congenial to a large measure of personal liberty&quot;. He argues these are no small achievements and only capitalism has proved capable of providing them. However, it also imposes a great &quot;psychic burden&quot; upon the individual and the social order. Because it does not meet the individual&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;existential&#x27; human needs&quot;, it creates a &quot;spiritual malaise&quot; that threatens the legitimacy of that social order. As much as anything else, it is the withholding of that potential third cheer that is the distinctive mark of neo-conservatism as Kristol understood it.

Regarding foreign policy Kristol said &quot;What&#x27;s the point in being the greatest, most powerful nation in the world and not having an imperial role?&quot;, adding that the USA &quot;should play a far more dominant role in world affairs&quot; in form of &quot;command[s] and giving orders as to what is to be done&quot;. Kristol was pessimistic about the prospects of the Vietnam War, believing that South Vietnam was &quot;barely capable of decent self-government under the best of conditions. It lacks the political traditions, the educated classes, the civic spirit that makes self-government workable.&quot; Due to this the most America could hope for would be to &quot;remove this little, backward nation from the front line of the Cold War so that it can stew quietly in its own political juice&quot;.

== Awards and honors ==
In July 2002, he received from President George W. Bush the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation&#x27;s highest civilian honor.

<doc id="229270" wikidata="Q1815059" url="?curid=229270" title="Widerstehe doch der Sünde, BWV 54">
<text> (Just resist sin), BWV 54, is a church cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach. He composed the solo cantata for alto in Weimar between 1711 and 1714, and probably performed it on the seventh Sunday after Trinity, 15 July 1714. It is Bach&#x27;s first extant church cantata for a solo voice.

The text of the short work was written by Georg Christian Lehms, for two arias and a connecting recitative. The topic is to resist sin, based on the Epistle of James. The text was published in a 1711 collection, dedicated to the Sunday Oculi. It is not known when Bach composed the work but is assumed that he performed it as part of his monthly cantata productions in 1714 on the seventh Sunday after Trinity, 15 July. The solo voice is accompanied by strings: two violin parts, two viola parts and continuo. The composition begins with a striking dissonant chord.
== History and words ==

The history of the composition is not clear. The text was written by Georg Christian Lehms for Oculi, the third Sunday in Lent, and published in 1711 in . It concentrates on avoiding sin, based on the Epistle of James. The first line of movement 3 quotes . Bach may have composed the cantata already before taking up regular cantata compositions in Weimar. He was appointed concertmaster of the Weimar court capelle of the co-reigning dukes Wilhelm Ernst and Ernst August of Saxe-Weimar, on 2 March 1714. As concertmaster, he assumed the principal responsibility for composing new works, specifically cantatas for the (palace church), on a monthly schedule.

The Bach scholar Alfred Dürr suggested that Bach performed the cantata for the Seventh Sunday after Trinity of 1714. The prescribed readings for the Sunday are from the Epistle to the Romans, &quot;the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life&quot; (), and from the Gospel of Mark, the feeding of the 4000 (). The cantata text relates to the epistle of both Sundays, but shows no connection to either Gospel.

While Dürr assumes that Bach first performed the cantata on 15 July 1714, other scholars arrive at different dates. John Eliot Gardiner and others assume Oculi that year which would make it the earliest cantata performed after the promotion. It is his first extant church cantata for a solo voice, followed by , for soprano. The cantata is the first of four written for a single alto soloist, the others, all composed in 1726, being , &quot;Vergnügte Ruh, beliebte Seelenlust&quot;, BWV 170, and , BWV 169, two of which also have texts by Lehms.

It is not clear what sort of alto singer (boy contralto? adult male falsettist? high tenor?) might have been the intended or actual first performer of &quot;Widerstehe doch der Sünde&quot;, especially given its low range and tessitura compared with other alto solo writing by Bach such as or &quot;Vergnügte Ruh, beliebte Seelenlust&quot;, BWV 170. If the cantata was written early in Bach&#x27;s (second) Weimar period, then perhaps the soloist could have been Adam Immanuel Weldig, the only falsettist in the Weimar court chapel in 1708 (the other five singers being a bass, two tenors and two teenage discantists). However, Weldig&#x27;s designation as &quot;falsettist&quot; may indicate that he was a soprano and not an alto. Weldig left Weimar in 1713 so could not have sung if the first performance was as late as 1714 as suggested by Dürr.

== Scoring and structure ==

The cantata, structured in three movements, is scored as chamber music for a solo alto voice, two violins (Vl), two violas (Va), and basso continuo (Bc). The duration is given as 14 minutes. The manuscript title page reads: &quot;Cantata.à 2 Violini, 2 Viole, Alto, Solo,
è Cont.: del J.S.B.&quot;.

In the following table of the movements, the scoring follows the Neue Bach-Ausgabe. The keys and time signatures are taken from Alfred Dürr, using the symbols for common time (4/4) and alla breve (2/2). The continuo, playing throughout, is not shown.



== Music ==

=== 1 ===
The first movement, &quot;&quot; (Just resist sin) is a da capo aria, which opens with a surprising dissonance and leaves its key of E-flat major open until a cadence in measure 8. Dürr describes it as a call to resistance and compares it to the beginning of the recitative &quot;&quot;, a call to be ready, in the cantata for Advent &quot;Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland&quot;, BWV 61, composed in 1714. Gardiner comments: &quot;It is a deliberate shock tactic to rouse his
listeners to the need to &#x27;stand firm against all sinning, or its poison will possess you&#x27;&quot;. Bach used the first aria again in his &quot;St Mark Passion&quot;.

=== 2 ===
The recitative &quot;&quot; (The way of vile sins) is secco, accompanied by the continuo. The words &quot;So zeigt sich nur ein leerer Schatten und übertünchtes Grab&quot; (It shows itself as only an empty shadow and a whitewashed grave) are expressed in &quot;pale&quot; harmonies. The final lines are arioso and illustrate in (It is like a sharp sword, that pierces through body and soul) the movement of the sword by fast runs in the continuo.

=== 3 ===
The final aria &quot;&quot; (He who sins is of the devil) is again a da capo aria, but shows elements of a four-part fugue for the voice, the violins in unison, the violas in unison and the continuo. Gardiner describes the theme as &quot;insinuating chromatic&quot; and the &quot;contorted counter-subject to portray the wily shackles of the devil&quot;.

== Recordings ==

The sortable listing is taken from the selection provided by Aryeh Oron on the Bach-Cantatas website. The sortable table is based on the listing on the Bach Cantatas website. The type of orchestra is roughly shown as a large group by red background, and as an ensemble playing period instruments in historically informed performance by green background.

<text>A crumble (British English) or crisp (American English) is typically a dessert with a crumbly topping consisting of flour, butter, sugar, and sometimes oats, baked over a fruit filling. Apple and rhubarb are two popular varieties. Savoury fillings such as meat, cheese or vegetables may alternatively be used. As a dessert, crumbles are traditionally served with custard, cream, or ice cream.

An apple crumble recipe involving a simple streusel topping appeared in the Canadian &quot;Farmer&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in February 1917. British chef and food writer Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall describes crumbles as a &quot;national institution&quot; that became popular in Britain since World War II, the topping being easier to prepare than pastry. Crumbles in varying forms are common in Britain, Ireland, and across the Commonwealth of Nations. While the dish is also found in the US, the most common variant is known as an &quot;apple crisp&quot; in American English.

<text>Lamb and mutton, collectively sheep meat (or sheepmeat) is one of the most common meats around the world, taken from the domestic sheep, &quot;Ovis aries&quot;, and generally divided into lamb, from sheep in their first year, hogget, from sheep in their second, and mutton, from older sheep. Generally, &quot;hogget&quot; and &quot;sheep meat&quot; are not used by consumers outside Norway, New Zealand, South Africa, Scotland, and Australia. Hogget has become more common in England, particularly in the North (Lancashire and Yorkshire) often in association with rare breed and organic farming.

In South Asian and Caribbean cuisine, &quot;mutton&quot; often means goat meat. At various times and places, &quot;mutton&quot; or &quot;goat mutton&quot; has occasionally been used to mean goat meat.

Lamb is the most expensive of the three types, and in recent decades, sheep meat has increasingly only been retailed as &quot;lamb&quot;, sometimes stretching the accepted distinctions given above. The stronger-tasting mutton is now hard to find in many areas, despite the efforts of the Mutton Renaissance Campaign in the UK. In Australia, the term prime lamb is often used to refer to lambs raised for meat. Other languages, such as French, Spanish, and Italian, make similar or even more detailed distinctions among sheep meats by age and sometimes by sex and diet—for example, &quot;lechazo&quot; in Spanish refers to meat from milk-fed (unweaned) lambs.

== Classifications and nomenclature ==

The definitions for lamb, hogget and mutton vary considerably between countries. Younger lambs are smaller and tenderer. Mutton is meat from a sheep over two years old, and has tougher flesh. In general, the darker the colour, the older the animal.

=== Britain, Australia, and New Zealand ===
;Lamb: A young sheep which is less than one year old. From 1 July 2019, the Australian definition is, &quot;an ovine animal that: (a) is under 12 months of age, or (b) does not have any permanent incisor teeth in wear&quot;. This new definition meant that Australian farmers could extend the term &quot;lamb&quot; by another month. This followed a similar definition change in New Zealand in 2018. In Britain the definition is still &quot;0 permanent incisor teeth&quot;. A permanent incisor tooth is said to be &quot;in wear&quot; if it protrudes further than the nearest milk teeth.
;Hogget: A sheep of either sex having no more than two permanent incisors in wear. The term is also used to refer to meat from the aforementioned animal. In the UK, it means animals that are 11 to 24 months old, while Australian butchers use the term for animals that are 13 to 24 months old. Still common in farming usage and among speciality butchers, it is now a rare term in British, Australian and New Zealand supermarkets, where meat of all sheep less than two years old tends to be called &quot;lamb&quot;.
;Mutton: The meat of a female (ewe) or castrated male (wether) sheep having more than two permanent incisors in wear.

=== United States ===
In the early 1900s, mutton was widely consumed in the United States, but mutton consumption has declined since World War II. , most sheep meat in the United States comes from animals in between 12 and 14 months old, and is called &quot;lamb&quot;; the term &quot;hogget&quot; is not used. Federal statutes and regulations dealing with food labeling in the United States permit all sheep products to be marketed as &quot;lamb.&quot; USDA grades for lamb are only partly a function of the animal&#x27;s age. Animals up to 20 months old may meet the quality of the &quot;USDA prime&quot; grade depending on other factors, while &quot;USDA choice&quot; lamb can be of any age.
&quot;Spring lamb&quot; is defined by the USDA as having been slaughtered between March and October.

===Italy===
In Romanesco dialect, the offspring of the sheep who is still suckling or recently weaned is called &quot;abbacchio&quot;, while the offspring of the sheep almost a year old who has already been shorn twice is called &quot;agnello&quot; (). This distinction exists only in the Romanesco dialect. &quot;Abbacchio&quot; is consumed throughout central Italy as an Easter and Christmas dish. It is a product protected by the European Union with the PGI mark.

Throughout central Italy, including Sardinia, pastoralism was the main source of meat. Since ancient times, &quot;abbacchio&quot; has been one of the staple foods of the Lazio region, especially for rural communities, whose consumption at the table was considerable. The tradition of consuming &quot;abbacchio&quot; spread in ancient times where mainly adult sheep were slaughtered. The slaughter of &quot;abbacchio&quot; was forbidden except during the Easter and Christmas periods, and until June. Over the centuries, given the importance of the food, around 100 recipes for preparing lamb have been developed in Lazio. Given the importance of &quot;abbacchio&quot; in social life, historical events dedicated to &quot;abbacchio&quot; are still organized in the Lazio region today, i.e. &quot;sagre&quot;, country festivals and popular events. In ancient times, sheep was eaten during work in the countryside, while &quot;abbacchio&quot; was consumed only during the Easter holidays.

=== South Asia ===

The term &quot;mutton&quot; is applied to goat meat in most countries of South Asia, and the goat population has been rising. For example, mutton curry is always made from goat meat. It is estimated that over a third of the goat population is slaughtered every year and sold as mutton. The domestic sheep population in India and the Indian subcontinent has been in decline for over 40 years and has survived at marginal levels in mountainous regions, based on wild-sheep breeds, and mainly for wool production.

=== Other types ===
;Suckling lamb or milk-fed lamb: meat from an unweaned lamb, typically 4–6 weeks old and weighing 5.5–8 kg; this is typically unavailable in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom. The flavour and texture of milk-fed lamb when grilled (such as the small lamb cutlets known as &quot;chuletillas&quot; in Spain) or roasted (&quot;lechazo asado&quot; or &quot;cordero lechal asado&quot;) is generally thought to be finer than that of older lamb, and fetches higher prices. The areas in northern Spain where this can be found include Asturias, Cantabria, Castile and León, and La Rioja. Milk-fed lambs are especially prized for Easter in Greece, when they are roasted on a spit.
;Young lamb: a milk-fed lamb between six and eight weeks old
;Spring lamb: a lamb, usually three to five months old, born in late winter or early spring and sold usually before 1 July (in the northern hemisphere).
;Sucker lambs: a term used in Australia — includes young milk-fed lambs, as well as slightly older lambs up to about seven months of age which are also still dependent on their mothers for milk. Carcases from these lambs usually weigh between 14 and 30 kg. Older weaned lambs which have not yet matured to become mutton are known as old-season lambs.
;Yearling lamb: a young sheep between 12 and 24 months old
;Saltbush mutton: a term used in Australia for the meat of mature Merinos which have been allowed to graze on atriplex plants
;Salt marsh lamb: (also known as &#x27;saltmarsh lamb&#x27; or by its French name, &quot;agneau de pré-salé&quot;) the meat of sheep which graze on salt marsh in coastal estuaries that are washed by the tides and support a range of salt-tolerant grasses and herbs, such as samphire, sparta grass, sorrel and sea lavender. Depending on where the salt marsh is located, the nature of the plants may be subtly different. Salt marsh lamb has long been appreciated in France and is growing in popularity in the United Kingdom. Places where salt marsh lamb are reared in the UK include Harlech and the Gower Peninsula in Wales, the Somerset Levels, Morecambe Bay and the Solway Firth.
;Saltgrass lamb: a type of lamb exclusive to Flinders Island (Tasmania). The pastures on the island have a relatively high salt content, leading to a flavor and texture similar to saltmarsh lamb.

== Butchery and cookery ==

The meat of a lamb is taken from the animal between one month and one year old, with a carcass weight of between . This meat generally is more tender than that from older sheep and appears more often on tables in some Western countries. Hogget and mutton have a stronger flavour than lamb because they contain a higher concentration of species-characteristic fatty acids and are preferred by some. Mutton and hogget also tend to be tougher than lamb (because of connective tissue maturation) and are therefore better suited to casserole-style cooking, as in Lancashire hotpot, for example.

Lamb is often sorted into three kinds of meat: , loin, and . The forequarter includes the neck, shoulder, front legs, and the ribs up to the shoulder blade. The hindquarter includes the rear legs and hip. The loin includes the ribs between the two.

Lamb chops are cut from the rib, loin, and shoulder areas. The rib chops include a rib bone; the loin chops include only a chine bone. Shoulder chops are usually considered inferior to loin chops; both kinds of chops are usually grilled. Breast of lamb (baby chops) can be cooked in an oven.

Leg of lamb is a whole leg; saddle of lamb is the two loins with the hip. Leg and saddle are usually roasted, though the leg is sometimes boiled.

Forequarter meat of sheep, as of other mammals, includes more connective tissue than some other cuts, and, if not from a young lamb, is best cooked slowly using either a moist method, such as braising or stewing, or by slow roasting or American barbecuing. It is, in some countries, sold already chopped or diced.

Lamb shank definitions vary, but generally include:
* a cut from the arm of shoulder, containing leg bone and part of round shoulder bone, and covered by a thin layer of fat and fell (a thin, paper-like covering).
* a cut from the upper part of the leg.

Mutton barbeque is a tradition in Western Kentucky. The area was strong in the wool trade, which gave them plenty of older sheep that needed to be put to use.

Thin strips of fatty mutton can be cut into a substitute for bacon called macon.

Lamb tongue is popular in Middle Eastern cuisine both as a cold cut and in preparations like stews.

==Production and consumption figures==
===Sheep meat consumption===
According to the OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook for 2016, the top consumers of sheep meat in 2015 were as follows: EU countries are not individually surveyed in this list. Among EU nations, Greece is the per capita leader in consumption at 12.3 kg, while the UK&#x27;s annual per capita lamb consumption is 4.7 kg. Outside of the OECD, the largest per capita consumer overall is Mongolia, with 45.1 kg.

=== Sheep meat production ===
The table below gives a sample of producing nations, but many other significant producers in the 50–120 kt range are not given.

== Dishes ==
Meat from sheep features prominently in the cuisines of several Mediterranean cultures including Greece, Croatia, Turkey, North Africa, Jordan, and the Middle East, as well as in the cuisines of Iran and Afghanistan. In Greece, for example, it is an integral component of many meals and of religious feasts such as Easter, like &quot;avgolemono&quot; and &quot;magiritsa&quot;. It is also popular in the Basque culture, both in the Basque country of Europe and in shepherding parts of the Western United States (where shepherds of Basque descent have been active since the 1850s). In the United States, the Navajo have incorporated mutton and lamb into their traditional cuisine since the introduction of sheep by Spanish explorers and settlers in the 17th century, replacing wild turkey and venison and creating a pastoral culture. In Northern Europe, mutton and lamb feature in many traditional dishes, including those of Iceland, Norway and Western Europe, including those of the United Kingdom, particularly in the western and northern uplands, Scotland and Wales. Mutton used to be an important part of Hungarian cuisine due to strong pastoral traditions but began to be increasingly looked down on with the spread of urbanisation.

Mutton is also popular in Australia. Lamb and mutton are very popular in Central Asia and in certain parts of China, where other red meats may be eschewed for religious or economic reasons. Barbecued mutton is also a specialty in some areas of the United States (chiefly Owensboro, Kentucky) and Canada. However, meat from sheep is generally consumed far less in the US than in many European, Central American and Asian cuisines; for example, average per-capita consumption of lamb in the United States is only per year.

In Australia, the leg of lamb roast is considered to be the national dish. Commonly served on a Sunday or any other special occasion, it can be done in a kettle BBQ or a conventional oven. Typical preparation involves covering the leg of lamb with butter, pushing rosemary sprigs into incisions cut in the leg, and sprinkling rosemary leaves on top. The lamb is then roasted for two hours at and typically served with carrots and potato (also roasted), green vegetables and gravy.

In Indonesia, lamb is popularly served as lamb satay and lamb curry. Both dishes are cooked with various spices from the islands, and served with either rice or lontong. A version of lamb and bamboo shoot curry is the specialty of Minang cuisine, although similar dishes can be found in Thai cuisine.

In Mexico, lamb is the meat of choice for &quot;barbacoa&quot;, in which the lamb is roasted or steamed wrapped in maguey leaves underground.

In Japan, although lamb is not traditionally consumed in most of the country, on the northern island of Hokkaido and in the northeastern Tohoku regions, a hot-pot dish called jingisukan (i.e. &quot;Genghis Khan&quot;) is popular. In that dish, thin-sliced lamb is cooked over a convex skillet alongside various vegetables and mushrooms in front of the diners, then dipped in soy-sauce-based dipping sauces and eaten. It was so named because lamb is popular in Mongolia (see &quot;Sheep meat consumption&quot; above).

===Organ meats/offal ===

Lamb&#x27;s liver, known as lamb&#x27;s fry in New Zealand and Australia, is eaten in many countries. It is the most common form of offal eaten in the UK, traditionally used in the family favourite (and pub grub staple) of liver with onions, potentially also with bacon and mashed potatoes. It is a major ingredient, along with the lungs and heart (the pluck), in the traditional Scottish dish of haggis.

Lamb testicles or lamb fries are a delicacy in many parts of the world.
Lamb kidneys are found in many cuisines across Europe and the Middle East, often split into two halves and grilled (on kebabs in the Middle East), or sautéed in a sauce. They are generally the most highly regarded of all kidneys.

Lamb sweetbreads are a delicacy in many cuisines.

== Environmental impact ==

Production of lamb emits more greenhouse gas per gram of protein than other common foods, except for beef.

<text>Northern Dobruja ( or simply ; , &quot;Severna Dobrudzha&quot;) is the part of Dobruja within the borders of Romania. It lies between the lower Danube River and the Black Sea, bordered in the south by Southern Dobruja, which is a part of Bulgaria.

==History==

Around 600 BC, the Greeks colonized the Black Sea shore and founded numerous fortresses: Tomis (today&#x27;s Constanța), Callatis, Histria, Argamum, Heracleea, Aegysus. The Greeks engaged in trade with the Dacians who lived on the main land. Dobruja became a Roman province after the conquest of the Dacian Tribes. One of the best preserved remnants of this period is the Capidava citadel.

Between the 7th and 14th century, Dobruja was part of the First Bulgarian Empire and the Second Bulgarian Empire.

For a long period in the 14–15th century, Dobruja became part of Wallachia. The territory fell under Ottoman rule from the mid-15th century until 1878, when it was awarded to Romania for its role in the 1877-78 Russo-Turkish War, and as compensation for the transfer of a region partly overlapping Southern Bessarabia. Under the treaties of San Stefano and Berlin, Romania received Northern Dobruja while the newly restored Principality of Bulgaria received the smaller southern part of the region. After the Second Balkan War in 1913, Romania also annexed the Bulgarian Southern Dobruja, which it ruled until the signing of the 1940 Treaty of Craiova. The treaty was approved by Britain, Vichy France, Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union and the United States. It included a population exchange which removed the Bulgarian minority from Northern Dobruja, which was evacuated to the southern part. At the same time, the Romanians (including Aromanians and Megleno-Romanians) from Southern Dobruja were brought north of the border. There also is a Csángó Hungarian village in Northern Dobruja, in the Constanța County, known as Oituz.

==Geography==
The territory of Northern Dobruja now forms the counties of Constanța and Tulcea, with a total area of 15,570 km2 and a current population of slightly under 900,000.

<text>The America First Committee (AFC) was an American isolationist pressure group against the United States&#x27; entry into World War II. Launched in September 1940, it surpassed 800,000 members in 450 chapters at its peak. The AFC principally supported isolationism for its own sake, and its varied coalition included Republicans, Democrats, farmers, industrialists, communists, anti-communists, students, and journalists – however, it was controversial for the anti-Semitic and pro-fascist views of some of its most prominent speakers, leaders, and members. The AFC was dissolved on December 11, 1941, four days after the attack on Pearl Harbor brought the United States into the war.

The AFC argued that no foreign power could successfully attack a strongly defended United States, that a British defeat by Nazi Germany would not imperil American national security, and that giving military aid to Britain would risk dragging the United States into the war. The group fervently opposed measures for the British advanced by President Franklin D. Roosevelt such as the destroyers-for-bases deal and the Lend-Lease bill, but failed in its efforts to block them.

The AFC was founded by Yale Law School student R. Douglas Stuart Jr., a Princeton graduate who was heir to the Quaker Oats Company fortune, and headed by Robert E. Wood, a retired U.S. Army general who was chairman of Sears, Roebuck and Co. Its highest-profile early member was Henry Ford, the automotive pioneer and notorious anti-Semite, who resigned in controversy. Halfway through the committee&#x27;s 15-month existence, aviator Charles Lindbergh joined it and became the most prominent speaker at its rallies. Lindbergh&#x27;s presence resulted in increased criticism that America First embraced overt anti-Semitism and fascist sympathies. Historian Susan Dunn has concluded that, &quot;Though most of its members were probably patriotic, well-meaning, and honest in their efforts, the AFC would never be able to purge itself of the taint of anti-Semitism.&quot;

==Background and origins==
American isolationism of the late 1930s had many adherents, and as historian Susan Dunn has written, &quot;isolationists and anti-interventionists came in all stripes and colors—ideological, economic, ethnic, geographical. Making up this eclectic coalition were farmers, union leaders, wealthy industrialists, college students, newspaper publishers, wealthy patricians, and newly arrived immigrants. There were a potpourri of affiliations and beliefs: Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives, socialists, communists, anti-communists, radicals, pacifists, and simple F.D.R.-haters.&quot; One of the most famous incidents occurred in February 1939 with a German American Bund organization&#x27;s Nazi-sympathizing rally, held at the famous sports arena Madison Square Garden in New York City, which attracted thousands.

Much of the impetus for this isolationism came from college students, with Yale University being a particularly strong outpost of such sentiments. The America First Committee was established on September 4, 1940, by Yale Law School student R. Douglas Stuart, Jr. (son of R. Douglas Stuart, co-founder of Quaker Oats). Stuart had been part of an earlier anti-interventionist student organization at Yale Law School, one that began in Spring 1940 and included future president Gerald Ford, future U.S. Supreme Court justice Potter Stewart, and future diplomat Eugene Locke as signatories to an initial organizing letter. Other Yale students who became involved were future Peace Corps director during the Kennedy presidential administration (and brother-in-law) Sargent Shriver, and Kingman Brewster Jr., who would later become president of Yale University. Stuart dropped out of Yale to focus on the anti-intervention cause, and during Summer 1940, he and Brewster found support for the cause among politicians in Washington and party conventions, and among corporate figures in Stuart&#x27;s home area of Chicago.

On September 5, the committee was publicly launched in a national radio broadcast by retired General Hugh S. Johnson, who had headed the National Recovery Administration (N.R.A.) during the early Great Depression as part of the New Deal programs combating the bad economic conditions for a while before President Roosevelt discharged him in 1934.

==Organization and membership==
America First chose retired Brigadier General Robert E. Wood, the 61-year-old chairman of Sears, Roebuck and Co., to preside over the committee. Wood remained in his post until the AFC was disbanded in the days after Japan&#x27;s attack on Pearl Harbor.

Organizationally, America First had an executive committee of about seven people, which took the lead in forming America First policies. Its initial members included Wood, Stuart, and several businessmen from the Midwest. There was also a larger national committee, which was composed of prominent individuals who supported America First&#x27;s aims. Over the course of the organization&#x27;s existence, some fifty people were part of the national committee. Finally, there were local chapters organized in cities and towns of various size wherever a sizeable anti-interventionist feeling existed. The existence of chapters permitted a more decentralized fundraising structure, with the chapters typically relying more on small contributions than the national entity.

Serious organization and recruitment efforts took place from Chicago, the national headquarters of the committee, not long after the AFC&#x27;s September 1940 establishment. These included the taking out of full-page advertisements in leading newspapers in various cities and paying for radio broadcasts.
Fundraising drives produced about $370,000 from some 25,000 contributors. Nearly half came from a few millionaires such as William H. Regnery, H. Smith Richardson of the Vick Chemical Company, General Robert E. Wood of Sears-Roebuck, publisher Joseph M. Patterson (New York &quot;Daily News&quot;) and his cousin, publisher Robert R. McCormick (&quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;). Other funding came from executives of Montgomery Ward, Hormel Foods, and the Inland Steel Company.

At its peak, America First claimed 800,000–850,000 members in 450 chapters, making the AFC one of the largest anti-war organizations in the history of the United States. Two-thirds of members were located within a 300-mile radius of Chicago, and 135,000 members in 60 chapters throughout Illinois, its strongest state. There were almost no AFC chapters in the American South, where traditions of involvement in the military and ancestral ties to the United Kingdom (Great Britain) were both strong.

The AFC was never able to draw sufficient funding to conducting its own public opinion polling. The New York chapter received slightly more than $190,000, most of it coming from its 47,000 contributors. As the AFC never had a national membership form or national dues, and local chapters were quite autonomous, historians point out that the organization&#x27;s leaders had no idea how many &quot;members&quot; it had.

The America First Committee attracted the sympathies of political figures, including: Democratic senators Burton K. Wheeler of Montana and David I. Walsh of Massachusetts, and Republican senators Gerald P. Nye of North Dakota and Henrik Shipstead of Minnesota. Philip La Follette, former Governor of Wisconsin and a founder of the Wisconsin Progressive Party, was another prominent member. Overall, support from politicians was strongest in the Midwest. Wheeler and Nye were especially active as speakers at America First rallies. Other celebrities supporting America First were actress Lillian Gish and architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Following his resignation as ambassador to the Court of St. James&#x27;s in late 1940, the increasingly isolationist, anti-British, and defeatist Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. was offered the chance to head the America First Committee. Members of the national committee included: advertising executive Chester Bowles, diplomat William Richards Castle Jr., journalist John T. Flynn, writer and socialite Alice Roosevelt Longworth, military officer and politician Hanford MacNider, novelist Kathleen Norris, New Deal administrator George Peek, and World War I flying ace and later aviation executive Eddie Rickenbacker.

The aforementioned Gerald Ford was one of the first members of the AFC when a chapter formed at Yale University (however he resigned from the AFC shortly afterward, lest he endanger his position as an assistant coach for Yale Bulldogs football); Potter Stewart also served on the original committee of the AFC.
Another future president, and son of the former and recently resigned American ambassador to Britain (Joseph P. Kennedy), John F. Kennedy contributed $100 with an attached note, &quot;What you are doing is vital.&quot;

==Issues==
When the war began in Europe (Nazi Germany&#x27;s invasion of Poland) in September 1939, most Americans, including politicians, demanded neutrality regarding Europe. Although most Americans supported strong measures against Japan, Europe was the focus of the America First Committee. The public mood was changing, however, especially after the fall of France in the spring of 1940. Still, while a majority of the public favored sending material assistance to Great Britain in its fight against Nazi Germany, a majority also wanted the United States to stay out of direct participation in the war.

There were various uncoordinated isolationist groups active during 1939–40, but the public disclosure by President Roosevelt of the destroyers-for-bases deal led to the announcement the following day, September 4, 1940, of the America First Committee, which would become the strongest such group. In its announcement, the AFC advocated four basic principles:

* The United States must build an impregnable defense for America.
* No foreign power, nor group of powers, can successfully attack a &quot;prepared&quot; America.
* American democracy can be preserved only by keeping out of the European war.
* &quot;Aid short of war&quot; weakens national defense at home and threatens to involve America in war abroad.

The America First Committee launched a petition aimed at enforcing the 1939 Neutrality Act and forcing President Franklin D. Roosevelt to keep his pledge to keep America out of the war. The committee profoundly distrusted Roosevelt, and argued that he was lying to the American people.

On January 11, 1941, the day after Roosevelt&#x27;s Lend-Lease bill was submitted to the United States Congress, Wood promised AFC opposition &quot;with all the vigor it can exert.&quot; America First staunchly opposed the convoying of ships involving the U.S. Navy, believing that any exchange of fire with German forces would likely pull the United States into the war. It also opposed the Atlantic Charter and the placing of economic pressure on Japan.

Consequently, America First objected to any material assistance to Britain, such as in destroyers-for-bases, that might drag the United States into the war and remained firm in its belief that Nazi Germany posed no military threat to the United States itself. The America First Committee was not a pacifist organization, however, and it based its beliefs around the aim that the United States would embody preparedness with a modern, mechanized army and a navy that would be strong in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

The principal pressure group opposing America First was the Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies, which argued that a German defeat of Britain would in fact endanger American security, and which argued that aiding the British would reduce, not increase, the likelihood of the United States being pulled into the war.

The Lend-Lease bill was debated fiercely in Congress for two months, and the America First Committee devoted its strength towards defeating it, but with the addition of a few amendments it was passed with solid margins in both houses of Congress and signed into law in March 1941. In the end, America First failed in all its efforts to prevent Roosevelt&#x27;s increasingly close relationship with Britain and failed in its efforts to legislatively block Roosevelt&#x27;s actions.

==Antisemitism, Lindbergh, and other extremists==
&quot;Seeking to brand itself as a mainstream organization, America First struggled with the problem of anti-Semitism of some of its leaders and many of its members&quot;, according to the historian Dunn. The group had some Jewish members at the outset: Sears heir and philanthropist Lessing J. Rosenwald was on the national committee; former California congresswoman Florence Prag Kahn was a member; and the first publicity director for the New York chapter was Jewish. However, the automotive pioneer and infamous anti-Semite Henry Ford had joined the national committee at the same time as Rosenwald, which soon led to Rosenwald resigning. In response, America First removed Ford from the national committee and also removed from it Avery Brundage, whose actions at the 1936 Berlin Olympics were associated with anti-Semitism. Attempts by America First to recruit other Jewish people to the national committee found no takers. As Dunn writes, &quot;the problem of anti-Semitism remained; some chapter leaders spewed anti-Semitic accusations, while others invited anti-Semitic speakers to address their members.&quot; America First tried to keep some distance between itself and the popular radio priest and fascist sympathizer Father Coughlin.

The world-famous American aviator Charles Lindbergh was admired in Germany and was allowed to see the buildup of the German air force, the Luftwaffe, in 1937. He was impressed by its strength and secretly reported his findings to the General Staff of the United States Army, warning them that the U.S. had fallen behind and that it must urgently build up its aviation. Lindbergh, who had feuded with the Roosevelt administration for years, delivered his first radio speech on September 15, 1939, through all three major radio networks. Voicing his belief that people of Northern and Western European descent were the safeguards of civilization against Asia (which included the Soviet Union), his speech argued that instead of fighting, all of Europe and the United States should &quot;defend the white race against foreign invasion&quot;.

For the first half of America First&#x27;s 15 months of existence, the group and Lindbergh kept at arm&#x27;s length from each other, as Stuart was leery of being too closely associated with some of the extreme views of Lindbergh&#x27;s circle, while for his part the aviator preferred to act independently. Wood, however, wanted to bring Lindbergh on, and on April 10, 1941, it was agreed that Lindbergh would join the national committee, with the aviator&#x27;s first rally appearance taking place on April 17 at the Chicago Arena.

Once he did join, Lindbergh became America First&#x27;s most prominent speaker. His involvement significantly increased rally attendance and organization membership, but it also greatly increased the level of criticism that America First faced from interventionists and from the Roosevelt administration.

On June 20, 1941, Lindbergh spoke to 30,000 people in Los Angeles and billed it as a &quot;Peace and Preparedness Mass Meeting&quot;. Lindbergh criticized the movements that he perceived were leading America into the war and proclaimed that the U.S. was in a position that made it virtually impregnable. He also claimed that the interventionists and the British who called for &quot;the defense of England&quot; really meant &quot;the defeat of Germany.&quot;

A speech that Lindbergh delivered to a rally in Des Moines, Iowa, on September 11, 1941, may have significantly raised tensions. He identified the forces pulling America into the war as the British, the Roosevelt administration, and American Jews. While he expressed sympathy for the plight of the Jews in Germany, he argued that America&#x27;s entry into the war would serve them little better:

Many condemned the speech as antisemitic. Journalist Dorothy Thompson wrote for the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; an opinion that many shared: &quot;I am absolutely certain that Lindbergh is pro-Nazi.&quot; Republican presidential candidate Wendell Willkie criticized the speech as &quot;the most un-American talk made in my time by any person of national reputation.&quot; In the end, Lindbergh&#x27;s remarks hurt the cause of the isolationists.

During the period after Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union had signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop non-aggression pact, most American Communists were opposed to the United States entering World War II, and they tried to infiltrate or take over America First. After June 1941, when Hitler launched Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union, they reversed positions and denounced the AFC as a Nazi front, a group infiltrated by German agents. Nazis also tried to use the committee. The aviator and orator Laura Ingalls&#x27; pro-Nazi rhetoric and straight-armed Nazi salutes on her America First speaking tour worried the group&#x27;s leadership, but they allowed her to continue because of praise from local chapters where she had spoken. When Ingalls was arrested in December 1941 and put on trial for being an unregistered Nazi agent, the prosecution revealed that her handler, German diplomat Ulrich Freiherr von Gienanth, had encouraged her to participate in AFC activities. In addition to Ingalls, who was convicted, another America First speaker would be convicted for failing to register as a Japanese agent.

Various historians have described attempts to keep Nazi and fascist sympathizers out of its chapters as not always successful. Historian Alexander DeConde wrote, &quot;Most of the America First supporters were middlewestern Republicans who distrusted the President for various reasons, but it was not a purely sectional organization or partisan political movement. Thousands of sincere Americans of varied background and from both political parties joined and contributed to it. It also attracted support from a number of fringe hate organizations, from anti-Semites, and from Nazi sympathizers. This minority support tarnished its reputation.&quot; Author Max Wallace argues that by the summer of 1941, &quot;extremist elements had successfully hijacked the movement&quot;.

==After Pearl Harbor==
After the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, AFC canceled a rally with Lindbergh at Boston Garden &quot;in view of recent critical developments,&quot; and the organization&#x27;s leaders announced their support of the war effort. Lindbergh gave this rationale:

With the formal declaration of war against Japan, the organization chose to disband. On December 11, the committee leaders met and voted for dissolution, the same day upon which Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy declared war on the United States. In a statement released to the press, the AFC wrote:

Once war was declared, the national leaders of the America First Committee supported the United States war effort, with many serving in some capacity. Similarly, many of the leaders of local chapters volunteered for service in the U.S. armed forces; a few continued to involve themselves in anti-war actions.

==Legacy==
In 1983, after his time as president of Yale had concluded, Brewster said he was glad that he and the other isolationists had failed. He also acknowledged that, consciously or not, there was anti-Semitism among the elites at Yale during that period.
Asked in a 2000 interview whether the leading members of the America First Committee had ever staged a reunion after the war, founder Stuart said, &quot;No, we did not. We may be a little sensitive to the fact that the world still thinks we&#x27;re the bad guys.&quot;

Paleoconservative commentator Pat Buchanan has praised America First and used its name as a slogan. &quot;The achievements of that organization are monumental,&quot; wrote Buchanan in 2004. &quot;By keeping America out of World War II until Hitler attacked Stalin in June 1941, Soviet Russia, not America, bore the brunt of the fighting, bleeding and dying to defeat Nazi Germany.&quot; Historian Wayne S. Cole concludes that while the America First Committee did not actually defeat any Roosevelt administration proposal in Congress, it made the margins of several such actions smaller than they would have been otherwise; and that throughout 1941, Roosevelt was constrained in his actions in support of Britain due to isolationist pressures in public opinion that America First did the most to mobilize.

The re-use of the &quot;America First&quot; phrase by Donald Trump in the 2016 United States presidential election led to a look back at the America First Committee through the filter of contemporary events. This included views on the level of extremism found in the 1940–41 movement as well as analysis of whether the new Trump administration was isolationist in the same sense.

<doc id="229283" wikidata="Q83971" url="?curid=229283" title="Tartary">
<text>Tartary (Latin: &quot;Tartaria&quot;; ; ; ) or Tatary () was a blanket term used in Western European literature and cartography for a vast part of Asia bounded by the Caspian Sea, the Ural Mountains, the Pacific Ocean, and the northern borders of China, India and Persia, at a time when this region was largely unknown to European geographers.

The active use of the toponym (place name) can be traced from the 13th to the 19th centuries. In European sources, Tartary became the most common name for Central Asia that had no connection with the real polities or ethnic groups of the region; until the 19th century, European knowledge of the area remained extremely scarce and fragmentary. In modern English-speaking tradition, the region formerly known as Tartary is usually called Inner Asia or Central Eurasia. Much of this area consists of arid plains, the main nomadic population of which in the past was engaged in animal husbandry.

Ignorance surrounding Tartary&#x27;s use as a place name has spawned conspiracy theories including ideas of a &quot;hidden past&quot; and &quot;mud floods&quot;. Such theories assert that Tartary (or the &quot;Tartarian Empire&quot;) was a lost civilization with advanced technology and culture. This ignores the well-documented history of Asia, which Tartary refers to. In the present day, the Tartary region spans from central Afghanistan to northern Kazakhstan, as well as areas in present Mongolia, China and the Russian Far East in &quot;Chinese Tartary&quot;.

== Geography and history ==
Knowledge of Manchuria, Siberia and Central Asia in Europe prior to the 18th century was limited. The entire area was known simply as &quot;Tartary&quot; and its inhabitants &quot;Tartars&quot;. In the early modern period, as understanding of the geography increased, Europeans began to subdivide Tartary into sections with prefixes denoting the name of the ruling power or the geographical location. Thus, Siberia was &quot;Great Tartary&quot; or &quot;Russian Tartary&quot;, the Crimean Khanate was &quot;Little Tartary&quot;, Manchuria was &quot;Chinese Tartary&quot;, and western Central Asia (prior to becoming Russian Central Asia) was known as &quot;Independent Tartary&quot;. By the seventeenth century, however, largely under the influence of Catholic missionary writings, the word &quot;Tartar&quot; came to refer to the Manchus and the lands they ruled as &quot;Tartary&quot;.

European opinions of the area were often negative, and reflected the legacy of the Mongol invasions that originated from this region. The term originated in the wake of the widespread devastation spread by the Mongol Empire. The adding of an extra &quot;r&quot; to &quot;Tatar&quot; was suggestive of Tartarus, a Hell-like realm in Greek mythology. In the 18th century, conceptions of Siberia or Tartary and its inhabitants as &quot;barbarous&quot; by Enlightenment-era writers tied into contemporary concepts of civilization, savagery and racism.

More positive opinions were also expressed by Europeans. Some saw Tartary as a possible source of spiritual knowledge lacking in contemporary European society. In &quot;Five Years of Theosophy&quot;, edited by the Theosophist and scholar G.R.S. Mead, the polymath and &quot;seer&quot; Emanuel Swedenborg is quoted as having advised, &quot;Seek for the Lost Word among the hierophants of Tartary, China, and Tibet.&quot;

=== Decline ===
The use of &quot;Tartary&quot; declined as the region became more known to European geographers; however, the term was still used long into the 19th century. Ethnographical data collected by Jesuit missionaries in China contributed to the replacement of &quot;Chinese Tartary&quot; with Manchuria in European geography by the early 18th century. The voyages of Egor Meyendorff and Alexander von Humboldt into this region gave rise to the term Central Asia in the early 19th century as well as supplementary terms such as Inner Asia, and Russian expansionism led to the term &quot;Siberia&quot; being coined for the Asian half of the Russian Empire.

By the 20th century, Tartary as a term for Siberia and Central Asia was obsolete. However, it lent the title to Peter Fleming&#x27;s 1936 book &quot;News from Tartary&quot;, which detailed his travels in Central Asia.

== Tartaria conspiracy theory ==
Misinterpretations of Tartary as an empire distinct from the Mongol Empire, rather than as an archaic name for Central Asia, gave rise to a conspiracy theory alleging the existence of an advanced &quot;Tartarian Empire&quot;.

<text>In computer programming, a window class is a fundamental in many windowing systems, including the Microsoft Windows (Win16, Win32, and Win64) operating systems, IBM OS/2 and the X Window System. The class defines the window procedure used tp process messages for all windows created with that class. 

The structure provides a template from which windows may be created by specifying a window&#x27;s icons, menu, background color and a few other features. It also holds a pointer to a procedure that controls how the window behaves in response to user interaction. It finally tells the operating system how much additional storage space is needed for the class and each window created from it.

<doc id="229291" wikidata="Q5245169" url="?curid=229291" title="Dead End Kids">
<text>The Dead End Kids were a group of young actors from New York City who appeared in Sidney Kingsley&#x27;s Broadway play &quot;Dead End&quot; in 1935. In 1937, producer Samuel Goldwyn brought all of them to Hollywood and turned the play into a film. They proved to be so popular that they continued to make movies under various monikers, including the Little Tough Guys, the East Side Kids, and the Bowery Boys, until 1958.
==History (1934–1939)==
In 1934, Sidney Kingsley wrote a play about a group of children growing up on the streets of New York City. Fourteen children were hired to play various roles in the play, including Billy Halop (Tommy), Bobby Jordan (Angel), Huntz Hall (Dippy), Charles Duncan (Spit), Bernard Punsly (Milty), Gabriel Dell (T.B.), and Leo and David Gorcey (Second Avenue Boys). Duncan left for a role in another play before opening night, and was replaced by Leo, his understudy. Leo had been a plumber&#x27;s assistant and was originally recruited by his brother David to audition for the play.

The play opened at the Belasco Theatre on October 28, 1935, and ran for two years, totaling 684 performances. Samuel Goldwyn and director William Wyler saw the play and decided to turn it into a film. They paid $165,000 for the rights to the film and began auditioning actors in Los Angeles. Failing to find actors who could convey the emotions they saw in the play, Goldwyn and Wyler had six of the original Kids (Halop, Jordan, Hall, Punsly, Dell, and Leo Gorcey) brought from New York City to Hollywood for the film. The Kids were all signed to two-year contracts, allowing for possible future films, and began working on the 1937 United Artists&#x27; film, &quot;Dead End&quot;.
The actual name of the gang of boys in &quot;Dead End&quot; is written in chalk on the wall shown throughout the movie. It reads: &quot;East 53rd Place Gang Members Only&quot;.
During production, the boys ran wild around the studio, destroying property, including a truck that they crashed into a sound stage. Goldwyn chose not to use them again and sold their contract to Warner Bros.

Warner Bros. had initially attempted to rename them the &quot;Crime School Kids&quot; through advertisements for their first two films produced there, starting with &quot;Crime School&quot; (1937), to disassociate them from their previous studio&#x27;s film, and promote their own. In 1938, they made their only color appearance in a short film, &quot;Swingtime in the Movies&quot;, and were referred to as that name. This was all in vain, though, as the name never caught on, and they remained the Dead End Kids.

At Warner Bros., the Dead End Kids made six films, including &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot;, with some of the top actors in Hollywood, including James Cagney, Humphrey Bogart, John Garfield, Pat O&#x27;Brien, and Ronald Reagan. The last one was in 1939, when they were released from their contracts owing to more antics on the studio lot.

===Filmography===
==Little Tough Guys (1938–1943)==

In 1938, Universal Pictures made an imitation Dead End Kids drama, &quot;Little Tough Guy&quot;. Leo Gorcey and Bobby Jordan remained under contract to Warners, so Universal hired the remaining four Dead End Kids. The film proved successful enough for Universal to launch a &quot;Little Tough Guys&quot; series in 1939, but by this time the original gang members were not available, so Universal filled the roles with other Hollywood juveniles (including future series perennials David Gorcey and Billy Benedict). Eventually all of the original Dead End Kids except Leo Gorcey joined the Universal series, which became known as &quot;The Dead End Kids and the Little Tough Guys.&quot; The final Universal film was &quot;Keep &#x27;Em Slugging&quot; (1943) with Bobby Jordan in the leading role.

==The East Side Kids (1940–1945)==

Producer Sam Katzman, releasing through Monogram Pictures, began his own tough-kid series, beginning with the 1940 film &quot;East Side Kids&quot;. As was the case at Universal, none of the original Dead End Kids was available, so Katzman hired six juveniles to fill the roles. For the second film, Katzman engaged Bobby Jordan and Leo Gorcey, along with David Gorcey and Our Gang alumni &quot;Sunshine&quot; Sammy Morrison and Donald Haines. In 1941 Huntz Hall and Gabriel Dell joined the series, now known as &quot;The East Side Kids&quot;, followed in 1943 by Billy Benedict.

A total of 22 East Side Kids films were made, ending with &quot;Come Out Fighting&quot; in 1945.

==The Bowery Boys (1946–1958)==

In 1946, Bobby Jordan, Huntz Hall, and Leo Gorcey, working with Jordan&#x27;s agent Jan Grippo, revamped The East Side Kids, renaming them &quot;The Bowery Boys&quot;. These films followed a more established formula, with each member playing the same character steadily. During the series&#x27;s freshman year, the gang was Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, Bobby Jordan, Gabriel Dell, Billy Benedict, and David Gorcey. Jordan left the series in 1947, followed by Dell in 1950, Benedict in 1951, and Leo Gorcey in 1956. Only Huntz Hall and David Gorcey remained from the original gang, with Stanley Clements stepping into the role of Hall&#x27;s sidekick. In all, 48 Bowery Boys films were made, ending with 1958&#x27;s &quot;In the Money&quot;. During the series Hall and Dell did a nightclub act together. Gorcey and Hall reteamed on the film &quot;Second Fiddle to a Steel Guitar&quot; then finally, in &quot;The Phynx&quot;.

==Epilogue==

The various teams that began life as &quot;The Dead End Kids&quot; made 89 films and three serials for four different studios during their 21-year-long film career. The team was awarded a star on Hollywood&#x27;s Walk of Fame that can be found at the corner of La Brea and Hollywood.

One notable aspect of the group&#x27;s history is their transition from stark drama to comedy. When they began, in &quot;Dead End&quot; and their other early films, their characters were serious, gritty, genuinely menacing young hoodlums. But, by the height of their career, their movies were comedies, with the Kids depicted as low-class but basically harmless, likable teens – comic caricatures of their former selves.

The original play has had two revivals. A 1978 adaptation played at the Quigh Theatre in New York, N.Y. and another in 2005 at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles. In 2022, a musical adaptation of the play was produced as a concept album available for digital download. The adaptation was written by Neil Fishman (music), Harvey Edelman (lyrics), and Peter C. Palame (book) and published by Sammy Smile Music LLC.


==Members==
* Billy Halop served as the original leader of the &quot;Dead End Kids&quot;. Also appeared in the &#x27;Dead End Kids and Little Tough Guys&quot; films of Universal. He later appeared on &quot;All in the Family&quot; in a recurring role.
* Leo Gorcey was the only original Dead End Kid to only appear in the Dead End Kids films, East Side Kids and Bowery Boys. He was known for his diminutive stature, wise guy attitude, and frequent malapropisms, which he delivered in a Brooklyn accent. While he played various characters in the &quot;Dead End Kids&quot;, &quot;East Side Kids&quot;, and &quot;Bowery Boys&quot; films, these roles tended to be similar street tough characters. For the East Side Kids, he almost always was the leader of the gang, aside from the last film that starred Bobby Jordan as the leader without Leo. In the &quot;Bowery Boys&quot; series, he was the leader of the group, aside from the last seven films in which he didn&#x27;t appear after his father died, who played Louie the shop owner in the series.
* Huntz Hall appeared in all incarnations in the series of films, Dead End Kids, Little Tough Guys, East Side Kids and Bowery Boys. In the Bowery Boys, he became known for his goofy, bumbling character Horace DeBussy &quot;Sach&quot; Jones. Following Gorcey&#x27;s departure, he became the focal point of the series. Later, Hall acted in war films and staged a successful nightclub act with fellow actor Gabriel Dell.
* Bobby Jordan was the youngest member of the group. He appeared in all incarnations of the group. Over time, with the rising popularity of Gorcey and Hall, Jordan&#x27;s role was reduced to little more than a background character.
* Gabriel Dell was the final and third of the original 6 Dead End Kids to appear in all incarnations of the gangs. He was often cast in character roles apart from the gang members in the Eastside kids series. Dell continued to act in both film and television roles for the rest of his life.
* Bernard Punsley (also spelled Punsly), like Billy Halop, only appeared in the Dead End Kids and Dead End Kids and Little Tough Guys series. He was known for his well-meaning, likable personality. He tended to play &quot;new kid on the block&quot; type roles and act as a voice of reason among the gang. After serving in the military, Punsley became a doctor and retired from show business altogether.

<doc id="229292" wikidata="Q1334113" url="?curid=229292" title="Reference (computer science)">
<text>In computer programming, a reference is a value that enables a program to indirectly access a particular datum, such as a variable&#x27;s value or a record, in the computer&#x27;s memory or in some other storage device. The reference is said to refer to the datum, and accessing the datum is called [[Dereference operator|dereferencing]] the reference. A reference is distinct from the datum itself.

A reference is an abstract data type and may be implemented in many ways. Typically, a reference refers to data stored in memory on a given system, and its internal value is the memory address of the data, i.e. a reference is implemented as a pointer. For this reason a reference is often said to &quot;point to&quot; the data. Other implementations include an offset (difference) between the datum&#x27;s address and some fixed &quot;base&quot; address, an index, or identifier used in a lookup operation into an array or table, an operating system handle, a physical address on a storage device, or a network address such as a URL.

==Formal representation==
A reference &quot;R&quot; is a value that admits one operation, dereference(&quot;R&quot;), which yields a value. Usually the reference is typed so that it returns values of a specific type, e.g.:

interface Reference&lt;T&gt; {
 T value();


Often the reference also admits an assignment operation store(&quot;R&quot;, &quot;x&quot;), meaning it is an abstract variable.

==Use==
References are widely used in programming, especially to efficiently pass large or mutable data as arguments to procedures, or to share such data among various uses. In particular, a reference may point to a variable or record that contains references to other data. This idea is the basis of indirect addressing and of many linked data structures, such as linked lists. References increase flexibility in where objects can be stored, how they are allocated, and how they are passed between areas of code. As long as one can access a reference to the data, one can access the data through it, and the data itself need not be moved. They also make sharing of data between different code areas easier; each keeps a reference to it.

References can cause significant complexity in a program, partially due to the possibility of dangling and wild references and partially because the topology of data with references is a directed graph, whose analysis can be quite complicated. Nonetheless, references are still simpler to analyze than pointers due to the absence of pointer arithmetic.

The mechanism of references, if varying in implementation, is a fundamental programming language feature common to nearly all modern programming languages. Even some languages that support no direct use of references have some internal or implicit use. For example, the call by reference calling convention can be implemented with either explicit or implicit use of references.

==Examples==
Pointers are the most primitive type of reference. Due to their intimate relationship with the underlying hardware, they are one of the most powerful and efficient types of references. However, also due to this relationship, pointers require a strong understanding by the programmer of the details of memory architecture. Because pointers store a memory location&#x27;s address, instead of a value directly, inappropriate use of pointers can lead to undefined behavior in a program, particularly due to dangling pointers or wild pointers. Smart pointers are opaque data structures that act like pointers but can only be accessed through particular methods.

A handle is an abstract reference, and may be represented in various ways. A common example are file handles (the FILE data structure in the C standard I/O library), used to abstract file content. It usually represents both the file itself, as when requesting a lock on the file, and a specific position within the file&#x27;s content, as when reading a file.

In distributed computing, the reference may contain more than an address or identifier; it may also include an embedded specification of the network protocols used to locate and access the referenced object, the way information is encoded or serialized. Thus, for example, a WSDL description of a remote web service can be viewed as a form of reference; it includes a complete specification of how to locate and bind to a particular web service. A reference to a live distributed object is another example: it is a complete specification for how to construct a small software component called a &quot;proxy&quot; that will subsequently engage in a peer-to-peer interaction, and through which the local machine may gain access to data that is replicated or exists only as a weakly consistent message stream. In all these cases, the reference includes the full set of instructions, or a recipe, for how to access the data; in this sense, it serves the same purpose as an identifier or address in memory.

If we have a set of keys &quot;K&quot; and a set of data objects &quot;D&quot;, any well-defined (single-valued) function from &quot;K&quot; to &quot;D&quot; ∪ {null} defines a type of reference, where &quot;null&quot; is the image of a key not referring to anything meaningful.

An alternative representation of such a function is a directed graph called a reachability graph. Here, each datum is represented by a vertex and there is an edge from &quot;u&quot; to &quot;v&quot; if the datum in &quot;u&quot; refers to the datum in &quot;v&quot;. The maximum out-degree is one. These graphs are valuable in garbage collection, where they can be used to separate accessible from inaccessible objects.

==External and internal storage==
In many data structures, large, complex objects are composed of smaller objects. These objects are typically stored in one of two ways:

# With internal storage, the contents of the smaller object are stored inside the larger object.
# With external storage, the smaller objects are allocated in their own location, and the larger object only stores references to them.

Internal storage is usually more efficient, because there is a space cost for the references and dynamic allocation metadata, and a time cost associated with dereferencing a reference and with allocating the memory for the smaller objects. Internal storage also enhances locality of reference by keeping different parts of the same large object close together in memory. However, there are a variety of situations in which external storage is preferred:

* If the data structure is recursive, meaning it may contain itself. This cannot be represented in the internal way.
* If the larger object is being stored in an area with limited space, such as the stack, then we can prevent running out of storage by storing large component objects in another memory region and referring to them using references.
* If the smaller objects may vary in size, it is often inconvenient or expensive to resize the larger object so that it can still contain them.
* References are often easier to work with and adapt better to new requirements.

Some languages, such as Java, Smalltalk, Python, and Scheme, do not support internal storage. In these languages, all objects are uniformly accessed through references.

==Language support==

=== Assembly ===
In assembly language, it is typical to express references using either raw memory addresses or indexes into tables. These work, but are somewhat tricky to use, because an address tells you nothing about the value it points to, not even how large it is or how to interpret it; such information is encoded in the program logic. The result is that misinterpretations can occur in incorrect programs, causing bewildering errors.

=== Lisp ===

One of the earliest opaque references was that of the Lisp language cons cell, which is simply a record containing two references to other Lisp objects, including possibly other cons cells. This simple structure is most commonly used to build singly linked lists, but can also be used to build simple binary trees and so-called &quot;dotted lists&quot;, which terminate not with a null reference but a value.

=== C/C++ ===
The pointer is still one of the most popular types of references today. It is similar to the assembly representation of a raw address, except that it carries a static datatype which can be used at compile-time to ensure that the data it refers to is not misinterpreted. However, because C has a weak type system which can be violated using casts (explicit conversions between various pointer types and between pointer types and integers), misinterpretation is still possible, if more difficult. Its successor C++ tried to increase type safety of pointers with new cast operators, a reference type codice_1, and smart pointers in its standard library, but still retained the ability to circumvent these safety mechanisms for compatibility.

===Fortran===
Fortran does not have an explicit representation of references, but does use them implicitly in its call-by-reference calling semantics. A Fortran reference is best thought of as an &quot;alias&quot; of another object, such as a scalar variable or a row or column of an array. There is no syntax to dereference the reference or manipulate the contents of the referent directly. Fortran references can be null. As in other languages, these references facilitate the processing of dynamic structures, such as linked lists, queues, and trees.

===Object-oriented languages===
A number of object-oriented languages such as Eiffel, Java, C#, and Visual Basic have adopted a much more opaque type of reference, usually referred to as simply a &quot;reference&quot;. These references have types like C pointers indicating how to interpret the data they reference, but they are typesafe in that they cannot be interpreted as a raw address and unsafe conversions are not permitted. References are extensively used to access and assign objects. References are also used in function/method calls or message passing, and reference counts are frequently used to perform garbage collection of unused objects.

===Functional languages===
In Standard ML, OCaml, and many other functional languages, most values are persistent: they cannot be modified by assignment. Assignable &quot;reference cells&quot; provide mutable variables, data that can be modified. Such reference cells can hold any value, and so are given the polymorphic type codice_2, where codice_3 is to be replaced with the type of value pointed to. These mutable references can be pointed to different objects over their lifetime. For example, this permits building of circular data structures. The reference cell is functionally equivalent to a mutable array of length 1.

To preserve safety and efficient implementations, references cannot be type-cast in ML, nor can pointer arithmetic be performed. In the functional paradigm, many structures that would be represented using pointers in a language like C are represented using other facilities, such as the powerful algebraic datatype mechanism. The programmer is then able to enjoy certain properties (such as the guarantee of immutability) while programming, even though the compiler often uses machine pointers &quot;under the hood&quot;.

=== Perl/PHP ===
Perl supports hard references, which function similarly to those in other languages, and symbolic references, which are just string values that contain the names of variables. When a value that is not a hard reference is dereferenced, Perl considers it to be a symbolic reference and gives the variable with the name given by the value. PHP has a similar feature in the form of its codice_4 syntax.

<doc id="229296" wikidata="Q192570" url="?curid=229296" title="Pons">
<text>The pons (from Latin , &quot;bridge&quot;) is part of the brainstem that in humans and other mammals, lies inferior to the midbrain, superior to the medulla oblongata and anterior to the cerebellum.

The pons is also called the pons Varolii (&quot;bridge of Varolius&quot;), after the Italian anatomist and surgeon Costanzo Varolio (1543–75). This region of the brainstem includes neural pathways and tracts that conduct signals from the brain down to the cerebellum and medulla, and tracts that carry the sensory signals up into the thalamus.

== Structure ==
The pons in humans measures about in length. It is the part of the brainstem situated between the midbrain and the medulla oblongata. The horizontal &quot;medullopontine sulcus&quot; demarcates the boundary between the pons and medulla oblongata on the ventral aspect of the brainstem, and the roots of cranial nerves VI/VII/VIII emerge from the brainstem along this groove. The junction of pons, medulla oblongata, and cerebellum forms the cerebellopontine angle. The &quot;superior pontine sulcus&quot; separates the pons from the midbrain. Posteriorly, the pons curves on either side into a middle cerebellar peduncle.

A cross-section of the pons divides it into a ventral and a dorsal area. The ventral pons is known as the basilar part, and the dorsal pons is known as the pontine tegmentum.

The ventral aspect of the pons faces the clivus, with the pontine cistern intervening between the two structures. The ventral surface of the pons features a midline basilar sulcus along which the basilar artery may or may not course. There is a bulge to either side of the basilar sulcus, created by the pontine nuclei that are interweaved amid the descending fibres within the substance of the pons. The superior cerebellar artery winds around the upper margin of the pons.

=== Vasculature ===
Most of the pons is supplied by the pontine arteries, which arise from the basilar artery. A smaller portion of the pons is supplied by the anterior and posterior inferior cerebellar arteries.

===Development===
During embryonic development, the metencephalon develops from the rhombencephalon and gives rise to two structures: the pons and the cerebellum. The alar plate produces sensory neuroblasts, which will give rise to the solitary nucleus and its special visceral afferent (SVA) column; the cochlear and vestibular nuclei, which form the special somatic afferent (SSA) fibers of the vestibulocochlear nerve, the spinal and principal trigeminal nerve nuclei, which form the general somatic afferent column (GSA) of the trigeminal nerve, and the pontine nuclei which relays to the cerebellum.

Basal plate neuroblasts give rise to the abducens nucleus, which forms the general somatic efferent fibers (GSE); the facial and motor trigeminal nuclei, which form the special visceral efferent (SVE) column, and the superior salivatory nucleus, which forms the general visceral efferent fibers (GVE) of the facial nerve.

===Nuclei===

A number of cranial nerve nuclei are present in the pons:
* mid-pons: the principal sensory nucleus of the trigeminal nerve (V)
* mid-pons: the motor nucleus for the trigeminal nerve (V)
* lower down in the pons: abducens nucleus (VI)
* lower down in the pons: facial nerve nucleus (VII)
* lower down in the pons: vestibulocochlear nuclei (vestibular nuclei and cochlear nuclei) (VIII)

==Function==
Functions of these four cranial nerves (V-VIII) include regulation of respiration, control of involuntary actions, sensory roles in hearing, equilibrium, and taste, and in facial sensations such as touch and pain, as well as motor roles in eye movement, facial expressions, chewing, swallowing, and the secretion of saliva and tears.

The pons contains nuclei that relay signals from the forebrain to the cerebellum, along with nuclei that deal primarily with sleep, respiration, swallowing, bladder control, hearing, equilibrium, taste, eye movement, facial expressions, facial sensation, and posture.

Within the pons is the pneumotaxic center consisting of the subparabrachial and the medial parabrachial nuclei. This center regulates the change from inhalation to exhalation.

The pons is implicated in sleep paralysis, and may also play a role in generating dreams.

==Clinical significance==
* Central pontine myelinolysis is a demyelinating disease that causes difficulty with sense of balance, walking, sense of touch, swallowing and speaking. In a clinical setting, it is often associated with transplant or rapid correction of blood sodium. Undiagnosed, it can lead to death or locked-in syndrome.

==Other animals==
===Evolution===
The pons first evolved as an offshoot of the medullary reticular formation. Since lampreys possess a pons, it has been argued that it must have evolved as a region distinct from the medulla by the time the first agnathans appeared, 525 million years ago.

<text>William A. Allain (February 14, 1928 – December 2, 2013) was an American politician and lawyer who held office as the 59th governor of Mississippi as a Democrat from 1984 to 1988. Born in Adams County, Mississippi, he attended the University of Notre Dame and received a law degree from the University of Mississippi School of Law in 1948.

He served in the U.S. Army during the Korean War and practiced law in Natchez until he was appointed Assistant Attorney General of Mississippi in 1962. In 1979 he was elected Attorney General of Mississippi. In that capacity he fought utility rate increases and sued to have members of the Mississippi State Legislature removed from executive boards in state government.

Allain ran for gubernatorial office in 1983. During the general election allegations emerged that Allain had engaged in sexual activity with transvestites. The veracity of the allegations were disputed and Allain won the election, but his credibility with the public was damaged and made it difficult for him to secure public support for his ideas as governor.

Taking office in January 1984, he blocked tax increases and unsuccessfully pushed for a constitutional convention. Leaving office in January 1988, he opened a law practice in Jackson. He died there after becoming stricken with pneumonia in 2013.

==Early life==
William Allain was born in Washington in Adams County, Mississippi, United States on February 14, 1928. He was educated in county public schools and graduated from Natchez High School. He studied pre-law at University of Notre Dame and enrolled at the University of Mississippi School of Law in 1948, graduating with a law degree in May 1950.

Allain opened a law office in Natchez later that year, though upon the outbreak of the Korean War he enlisted in the United States Army infantry. Honorably discharged in 1953, he returned to legal practice. He was a member of the American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars. He married Dorus Johnson in 1964 and divorced her in 1970. He continued to practice law until he was appointed Assistant Attorney General of Mississippi in 1962. In that capacity he represented the state government in state courts, federal district and appellate courts, and the United States Supreme Court. He helped to represent the state to the federal government during the integration of the University of Mississippi and in the &quot;Conner v. Johnson&quot; reapportionment cases. Leaving the post in 1975, he practiced law in Jackson until 1979.

== Political career ==
=== Attorney General ===
In 1979 Allain sought election to the office of Attorney General of Mississippi. A Democrat, he faced Republican Charles W. Pickering in the general election. Opinion polls showed Pickering with a lead throughout most of the campaign. Two days before the election date, Pickering&#x27;s campaign organization ran a series of radio ads in black-majority communities which accused Allain of opposing civil rights for blacks throughout his career and being a former member of a Citizens&#x27; Council. Allain&#x27;s campaign publicized the ads further and denounced them as &quot;gutter tactics&quot;, with the hopes of assuaging blacks&#x27; possible concerns while also garnering support from conservative whites. The following day both candidates scheduled press conferences in each major city in the state with a television media market. Allain&#x27;s campaign scheduled him just before Pickering&#x27;s appearances. In Jackson, Allain was slated to appear at the same hotel room as his opponent. His campaign team arranged for the room to be professionally lit, and Allain denounced Pickering for having &quot;lied to the people of the state of Mississippi. He says one thing to the black community and another to the whites.&quot; Allain&#x27;s team then removed their lights, leaving Pickering to deliver his press conference in a comparatively dim setting while overwhelmed with questions about his ads from reporters. Allain was elected state attorney general on November 6, with Pickering attributing his defeat to the fallout from his ads.

Allain earned a reputation as a consumer advocate. He fought utility rate increases and stopped the storage of nuclear waste in Mississippi. State labor president Claude Ramsay sought to broker an agreement between Democratic Party presidential candidate Walter F. Mondale and Allain when the latter sought a veto over the federal storage of nuclear waste in Mississippi as a condition for his political support of Mondale.

In December 1981 Allain advised 36 members of the Mississippi State Legislature that they should be removed from executive boards in state government, arguing that their participation on these bodies violated the separation of powers language in the Mississippi Constitution. After the legislature ignored the issue during its 1982 session, he warned them that he would pursue legal action against them. When final negotiations between the two parties failed, the legislators sued Allain on April 7, 1982 to secure a legal judgement in their favor. He filed his own lawsuit several hours later. The case was initially heard in the Hinds County Circuit Court in November, and the following February the circuit court judge ruled in Allain&#x27;s favor. The legislators concerned appealed the case to the Supreme Court of Mississippi, which unanimously affirmed the previous decision in &quot;Alexander v. State of Mississippi by and Through Allain&quot; and ordered the legislators to vacate their executive positions.

=== 1983 gubernatorial campaign ===
In 1983 Allain ran for the office of governor, facing five other candidates in the Democratic primary, including businessman Mike Sturdivant and former lieutenant governor Evelyn Gandy. While Gandy was the most well-known of the three, Allain benefitted from press coverage throughout the year for his efforts to have convicted murderer Jimmy Lee Gray executed. He placed second in the Democratic primary and defeated Gandy in the primary runoff and faced Republican candidate Leon Bramlett in the general election. Allain ran a populist-style campaign, emphasizing his work as attorney to general to prevent utility rate increases. Early polls indicated that he had a large lead over Bramlett.

During the campaign Bramlett attacked Allain for being a &quot;bachelor&quot; and emphasized that he was &quot;blessed&quot; with a wife and children and thus more qualified to manage education and healthcare issues. Allain accused Bramlett making &quot;smears and innuendo&quot; and of rumor–mongering, and emphasized that he had once had three step-children through his previous marriage. Meanwhile, three Republican oil company executives, having heard rumors that Allain regularly solicited sex from black transvestites, decided to enlist attorney Bill Spell and a private detective agency to investigate the veracity of the claims. They obtained a copy of Allain&#x27;s divorce decree, which reportedly included grievances from his former wife that he would &quot;absent himself at night over long periods of time and failed to perform his husbandly duties.&quot; The attorney and detectives interviewed three black transvestites who testified that they had sex with Allain and repairmen from his former apartment complex who said they had seen gay pornography in his unit. The oil executives informed Bramlett of their findings, but he refused to support their efforts. State Democratic leaders were tipped off about the investigation and decided that they would rebuff any allegations and support Allain.

After failed attempts to get the media to report the story, Spell held a press conference on October 25 to publicly reveal the allegations, noting that the claims were supported by the three transvestites—who had undergone polygraph examinations—and by police officers who had reported witnessing Allain attempt to solicit transvestite prostitutes in the Farish Street District of Jackson. The allegations were printed on the front page of &quot;The Clarion-Ledger&quot; the following morning. Allain denounced the allegations as &quot;malicious lies&quot;, denied knowing the three transvestites, and said, &quot;I&#x27;m no sexual deviate and Leon Bramlett knows it.&quot; He also said he would sue his accusers for defamation. The oil executives and their detectives moved the transvestites around various motels to control their appearances. Bramlett distanced himself from them and maintained that he had no involvement in the investigation. Other Democratic statewide candidates rallied to Allain&#x27;s defense, while most media outlets rebuffed attempts by Spell to purchase advertisements to further publicize his findings.

Feeling that he was losing momentum, Spell began demanding that Allain take a polygraph test. The candidate agreed to do so, but the two men disputed the arrangement of the examination. Shortly thereafter, Bramlett&#x27;s campaign declared that if Allain passed three such tests the Republican would drop out of the race, while a group of businessmen demanded that both candidates take polygraph tests. Allain eventually took a polygraph test which supported his denials and his lawyer obtained an affidavit from one of the transvestite&#x27;s parents, denouncing their son&#x27;s credibility. By the close of the campaign, the contest had devolved into questions of the credibility of Allain and Spell, and Bramlett was largely forgotten by the public. In the general election on November 8, Allain won with 55 percent of the vote, while Bramlett only garnered 39 percent. In January 1984 the transvestites reneged their stories, saying they had been paid for their testimonies, and Allain&#x27;s attorney said new polygraph test results showed they had lied in October. Considering the affair over, Allain never followed up on his threat of a lawsuit. Nevertheless, the allegations damaged Allain&#x27;s credibility with the public and made it difficult for him to secure public support for his ideas as governor.

=== Governor ===
Allain was sworn-in as Governor of Mississippi on January 10, 1984, becoming the first Roman Catholic to hold the office. He created an administrative task force of state agency heads to reduce the use of illegal drugs, leading to the interdiction and seizure of almost a ton of cocaine. He backed Steve Patterson&#x27;s successful bid to become chairman of the Mississippi Democratic Party in May 1984.

In 1984 the legislature passed a reorganization act which removed its members from executive boards—pursuant to the ruling in &quot;Alexander v. Allain&quot;—and created two new advisory budget commissions, one which consisted largely of legislators and another which was controlled by the governor. Allain took a passive approach towards crafting his first budget proposal, figuring—correctly—that the legislature would largely ignore it. Strongly opposed to tax increases, in 1985 he vetoed a hike which would back the raising of the salaries of public school teachers. This generated the first teacher strike in the state&#x27;s history, and eventually the legislature overrode his veto. His staunch refusal to support tax hikes contributed to the cutting of funding for many state services during his tenure.

After securing the removal of legislators from executive boards, Allain focused on reforming the State Highway Department, which was led by a three-member elected commission. He instead lobbied for the leadership of the department to be placed in a director to be appointed by the governor. Failing to secure this change, he vetoed the highway funding bill in 1986. Irritated by the department&#x27;s lack of responsiveness regarding questions over how much of its appropriated funds were not yet committed to projects, he issued an executive order to seize control of the department and its books so that leftover money could be moved into the state&#x27;s general fund. The attorney general ruled against the takeover of the department but permitted Allain to have its books audited. The audit revealed that the department had $23 million in uncommitted funds, and over the following two years the legislature re-appropriated most of the money to other areas.
In the aftermath of the 1986 legislative session, highway officials and several businessmen lobbied Allain to call the legislature into special session to fund the highways before the end of the fiscal year. He scheduled a special session for May 28, but backed away from his reform plan when it garnered little public traction. Highway funding was secured, while towards the end of the session the lobby group and the highway commissioners drafted a plan to greatly expand the number of the state&#x27;s four-lane highways, dubbed Advocating Highways for Economic Advancement and Development (AHEAD), financed by a five-cent increase on fuel-per-gallon taxes. Legislators introduced the bill at the open of their 1987 session, but Allain proposed his own program the following day, which included four-lane highway construction, a reorganization of the highway department, and scrapped the tax hike in favor of a bond issue. AHEAD supporters ignored Allain&#x27;s proposal, and were able to pass their program. Allain vetoed the bill, saying &quot;I am not willing to be a party to any program which means an undue tax increase, coupled with a continuance of present practices.&quot; The legislature subsequently overrode the governor&#x27;s veto.

In 1985 Allain appointed Reuben V. Anderson to the Mississippi Supreme Court, the first black man to ever sit on it. He also appointed a 350-person Constitutional Study Commission, chaired by former governor James P. Coleman. It outlined a new state constitution which greatly strengthened the executive authority of the governor, and appealed to the legislature to schedule a constitutional convention. The legislature scheduled two amendments for referendum in 1986, but though Allain publicly endorsed a full convention in early 1987, the legislature never permitted one to be held.

As the result of the referendum to amend the constitution in 1986, the Governor of Mississippi was permitted to seek election to a consecutive term. Allain did not indicate whether he intended to seek re-election, but let the June 5, 1987 filing deadline for candidates pass without taking any action. He later explained, &quot;I got a little tired [...] With age and everything else, I just decided I didn&#x27;t want to go campaign.&quot; He left office in January 1988.

== Later life ==
After leaving the governorship, Allain opened a law practice in Jackson. He generally kept to himself in later years, and in 2009 lost much of his eyesight to glaucoma. In late November 2013 he was hospitalized for pneumonia. He died in Jackson on December 2 and was buried in Natchez City Cemetery. Unlike most Mississippi governors, Allain did not have an official portrait painted of himself during his tenure, and one was not unveiled until 2018.

<text>Bradley James Nowell (February 22, 1968 – May 25, 1996) was an American musician and the lead singer of the band Sublime.

Born and raised in Belmont Shore, Long Beach, California, Nowell developed an interest in music at a young age. Nowell formed Sublime with bassist Eric Wilson and drummer Bud Gaugh, whom he had met while attending California State University, Long Beach. During his lifetime, Sublime released the albums &quot;40oz. to Freedom&quot; and &quot;Robbin&#x27; the Hood&quot; to critical and commercial success. In 1996, Nowell died of a heroin overdose in a San Francisco hotel while Sublime was on tour.

==Early life==
Nowell and his sister, Kellie, were born and raised in the Belmont Shore neighborhood of Long Beach, California, to Jim and Nancy Nowell. As a child, he enjoyed surfing and sailing, often participating in boat races. Nowell became a difficult child and was often hyperactive and disruptive; his mother recalled that he was &quot;very emotional, very sensitive, very artistic, but he was needy … He was always testing just to see what he could get away with.&quot; After his parents&#x27; divorce when he was 10, Nowell&#x27;s behavior worsened. His mother was originally awarded custody, but found him too difficult to control, and at the age of 10 he moved in full time with his father.

Music was an integral part of Nowell&#x27;s upbringing on the part of both of his parents. His father, a construction worker, enjoyed playing guitar and exposed him to the music of Jim Croce; his mother taught piano for a living in addition to playing the flute. Both parents helped teach young Nowell to play the guitar. In the summer of 1979, 11-year-old Nowell accompanied his father on a month-long sailing trip in the Virgin Islands, where he was first exposed to reggae music.

By the age of 16, he had started his first band, Hogan&#x27;s Heroes, with Michael Yates and Eric Wilson. Nowell was described as a &quot;gifted kid without many friends.&quot; At first, Wilson did not share Nowell&#x27;s interest in reggae music. Nowell recalled the experience: &quot;I was trying to get them to do (UB40&#x27;s version of) &#x27;Cherry Oh Baby,&#x27; and it didn&#x27;t work. They tried, but it just sounded like such garbage. We were horrible.&quot; Nowell attended Long Beach Polytechnic High School (where he took advanced courses) and graduated from Woodrow Wilson Classical High School in Long Beach. He attended the University of California, Santa Cruz before transferring to California State University, Long Beach to study finance. He dropped out one semester shy of earning a degree.

==Sublime==
In 1988, according to a Westwood One interview, which is available on disc three of the Sublime box set, Nowell, bassist Wilson, and drummer Bud Gaugh grouped together to perform small shows at house parties and barbecues. The band was often asked to leave the parties due to excessive noise. Despite their local success, music venues were skeptical of the band&#x27;s eclectic musical fusion and many refused to book the band. In response, Nowell and Wilson created their own music label, Skunk Records, telling venues they were &quot;Skunk Records recording artists,&quot; helping the band seem more accomplished and enabling them to book more shows. The band produced and distributed Sublime&#x27;s early recordings on the label, later selling demo tapes at shows and local record stores.

In 1990, music student Michael &quot;Miguel&quot; Happoldt offered to let the band record in the studio at the school where he was studying, although without the school&#x27;s knowledge. The band agreed, then sneaked into the school at night, where they recorded from midnight to seven in the morning. That recording session resulted in the cassette tape &quot;Jah Won&#x27;t Pay the Bills&quot;, released in 1991. The tape helped the band gain a grassroots following throughout Southern California. 

Using the same tactics they used in recording &quot;Jah Won&#x27;t Pay the Bills&quot;, the band recorded its debut album &quot;40oz. to Freedom&quot; in secrecy at the studios at California State University, Dominguez Hills. Nowell recalled, &quot;You weren&#x27;t supposed to be in there after 9 p.m., but we&#x27;d go in at 9:30 and stay until 5 in the morning. We&#x27;d just hide from the security guards. They never knew we were there. We managed to get $30,000 worth of studio time for free&quot;. &quot;40oz. to Freedom&quot; was released in 1992; 60,000 copies were sold.

Despite their growing popularity in Southern California, Sublime still was not signed with a major label. Around this same time, Nowell teamed up with longtime friend Gwen Stefani of No Doubt, to record the song &quot;Saw Red&quot;. The song was eventually released on Sublime&#x27;s &quot;Robbin&#x27; the Hood&quot; album, which was self-recorded on a four-track cassette, and released in October 1994. Several songs from the album detail Nowell&#x27;s worsening drug addiction.

About a year later, Tazy Phillipz took a copy of &quot;40oz. to Freedom&quot; to Los Angeles radio station KROQ-FM, requesting that Sublime&#x27;s song &quot;Date Rape&quot; be added to the playlist. Soon after, MCA Records picked up &quot;40oz. to Freedom&quot; for national distribution, and Sublime was scheduled to tour throughout Europe. Nowell, an avid reader who enjoyed quoting historians and philosophers, began studying European history to prepare for the trip. In February 1996, Sublime returned to the studio to record the bulk of their self-titled album, which would be their debut with MCA. Production was done by Paul Leary of the Butthole Surfers (and producer of Marcy Playground and Meat Puppets) at Willie Nelson&#x27;s Pedernales Studio in Austin, Texas.

Nowell died on May 25, 1996. Sublime&#x27;s final album was released on July 30, 1996. Its original title, &quot;Killin&#x27; It&quot;, was replaced by the eponymous title &quot;Sublime&quot;. By 1997, the album had entered Billboard&#x27;s Top 20, with the largely acoustic single, &quot;What I Got&quot;, becoming the number one song on the Modern Rock chart. The album produced three more radio hits: &quot;Santeria&quot;, &quot;Wrong Way&quot;, and &quot;Doin&#x27; Time&quot;. Sublime became one of the most successful American rock acts of 1997. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reported in March 2010 that the album &quot;Sublime&quot; had sold over six million copies.

==Personal life==
===Marriage and fatherhood===
While on tour in the early 1990s, Nowell began dating Troy Dendekker. In October 1994, Troy became pregnant, giving birth to a son, Jakob James Nowell, on June 25, 1995. On May 18, 1996, a week before Nowell&#x27;s death, the couple married in a Hawaiian-themed ceremony in Las Vegas.

In December 2023, Jakob Nowell joined Sublime as the band&#x27;s lead singer.

===Lou Dog===

In February 1990, Nowell purchased a Dalmatian puppy from an old man for $500, and named him &quot;Louie&quot; after his grandfather. Also referred to as &quot;Lou Dog&quot;, he became a mascot for the band Sublime. Lou Dog was often allowed to wander the stage during concert performances. Louie was also often featured on the cover of Sublime albums, and was referred to in the lyrics of Sublime songs. In Sublime&#x27;s most successful radio track, &quot;What I Got&quot;, Nowell sings, &quot;Livin&#x27; with Louie Dog&#x27;s the only way to stay sane&quot;. Another prominent song by the band, &quot;Garden Grove&quot;, mentions Lou Dog as such: &quot;We took this trip to Garden Grove.
It smelled like Lou Dog inside the van&quot;. Following Nowell&#x27;s death in 1996, Lou Dog was cared for by Michael Happoldt, the band&#x27;s manager. Lou Dog died from old age on September 17, 2001.

===Addiction===
As Nowell entered his twenties and witnessed his band&#x27;s success, he decided to try heroin. Nowell&#x27;s father explained, &quot;His excuse for taking the heroin was that he felt like he had to be larger than life. He was leading the band, leading his fans, and he had to put on this persona. He heard a lot of musicians say they were taking heroin to be more creative.&quot; Nowell became addicted to heroin. Some of Sublime&#x27;s songs relate to Nowell&#x27;s addiction. Nowell is said by some to have predicted his own death in the song &quot;Pool Shark&quot;, with the line, &quot;One day I&#x27;m gonna lose the war.&quot;

===Death===
On the morning of May 25, 1996, Sublime was in the midst of a five-day tour through Northern California that was to be followed by a European and East Coast tour. However, while the band was staying at the Ocean View Motel in San Francisco (later Seascape Inn), drummer Bud Gaugh awoke to find Nowell lying on the floor next to his bed. His dalmatian, Lou Dog, was curled up on the bed whimpering. Nowell had tried awakening his fellow bandmates to go to the beach with him that morning, but they were too hung over and tired to get out of bed. Initially, Gaugh assumed that Nowell was too intoxicated to get into bed. However, he noticed a yellow film around his mouth. Gaugh called for paramedics, but Nowell had died several hours earlier and was pronounced dead at the scene. Nowell was cremated and his ashes were spread over his favorite surfing spot in Surfside, California. A headstone was placed at Westminster Memorial in Westminster, California, in his memory. The cause of death was a heroin overdose.

Eight months after Nowell&#x27;s death, No Doubt headlined a &quot;cautionary&quot; benefit concert in honor of his memory. Nowell&#x27;s widow wanted to make it clear that the goal of the concert was not to glamorize his death, but rather to promote drug awareness and prevention among fans. Proceeds from the concert were given to a non-profit offering support for musicians struggling with drug addiction, as well as a scholarship fund for Nowell&#x27;s son, Jakob.

Jason Westfall, one of Sublime&#x27;s managers, was quoted as saying the surviving members of Sublime had no interest in continuing to perform and record under the &quot;Sublime&quot; name: &quot;Just like Nirvana, Sublime died when Brad died&quot;. However, the band reunited in 2023 with Nowell&#x27;s son serving as lead vocalist.

<doc id="229301" wikidata="Q3082962" url="?curid=229301" title="Coat of arms of Öland">
<text>Öland is a province of Sweden and, like many of Sweden&#x27;s provinces, was granted a coat of arms in preparation for the funeral of Gustav Vasa in 1560. Confusion arose between Öland&#x27;s arms with one deer and Åland&#x27;s arms with two deer and nine roses, resulting in Öland bearing the wrong coat of arms from the 1880s until an audit in 1944.

==A confusing error==
The coat of arms originally granted for the island province of Öland in 1560 displayed a golden red deer on a blue field and generally resembled Öland&#x27;s present arms but lacked the deer&#x27;s red collar and red antlers. In 1569, the island province of Åland had been given to the queen dowager Katarina Stenbock as a fief and was awarded a coat of arms displaying two roe deer on a field strewn with nine roses. The arms of these two similar-sounding provinces became confused early on, and in the 1880s Öland&#x27;s arms were recorded as two roe deer with nine roses.

During a heraldic revision in 1944, the office of the Swedish Herald of the Realm (&quot;Riksheraldikerämbetet&quot;) discovered that a mistake had been committed. It was then decided the Öland deer should have a collar, something which had sometimes occurred before and had been considered for Djurgården. So in 1944 the arms of Öland were reverted to the single golden red deer, which at this time was granted the distinction of a collar, marking it as the royal game.

Heraldic authorities in Finland had long since granted Åland (which Sweden had ceded to Russia in 1809 along with the rest of Finland) arms bearing a single golden red deer on a blue field. In 1944 they were notified of the error but ultimately decided not make any changes and not to adopt the coat of arms originally intended for Åland with the roe deer and the nine Finnish roses. This decision made it necessary for Swedish heralds to once again alter the coat of arms for Öland, to avoid further confusion. This change included the introduction of a red collar and red antlers and hooves.

==Öland&#x27;s arms 1944-present==
Official blazon (in Swedish): &quot;&quot;I blått fält en gående hjort av guld med rött halsband och röd beväring, därest sådan skall komma till användning.&quot; (In a blue field a walking deer of gold with red collar and red arms, when such shall come to use.)

The arms are displayed with a ducal coronet. The province was originally ranked as an earldom but following a decision by the Privy Council on January 18, 1884 gave all Provinces the right of use to a ducal coronet for their arms.

==Related arms==

===Åland===

Åland is today an autonomous province of Finland. The arms of Öland and Åland had been confused, leading Öland to adopt the arms intended for Åland, featuring two golden deer on a blue field strewn with nine white roses. Åland, meanwhile, retained the arms which had originally been granted to Öland in 1560 (a golden deer on a blue field). The arms of Åland are displayed with a comital coronet.

 Blazon (in Swedish): &quot;I blått fält en gående hjort av guld.&quot;&quot; (&quot;Azure, a hart passant Or&quot;.)

Blazon (in Finnish): &quot;&quot;Sinisessä kentässä on kävelevä kultainen saksanhirvi.&quot;

===Kalmar County===
The Kalmar County includes the eastern part of Småland and the island province of Öland. The arms are a combination of the arms of Småland and Öland. The arms are displayed with a royal crown, representing the County Administrative Board.

Blazon (in Swedish): &quot;Sköld kvadrerad av Smålands och Ölands vapen.&quot;&quot; (&quot;Quartered, the arms of Småland and Öland.&quot;)

<doc id="229302" wikidata="Q828305" url="?curid=229302" title="Skate punk">
<text>Skate punk (also known as skatecore and skate rock) is a skater subculture and punk rock subgenre that developed in the 1980s. Originally a form of hardcore punk that had been closely associated with skate culture, skate punk evolved into a more melodic genre of punk rock in the 1990s similar to pop punk. Since then, it has predominately featured fast tempos, lead guitar playing (including guitar riffs and guitar solos), fast drumming, and singing (sometimes including vocal harmonies). Occasionally, skate punk also combines the fast tempos of hardcore punk and melodic hardcore with the catchy hooks of pop-punk.

1970s and early 1980s punk rock bands like Buzzcocks, Descendents, Adolescents, Black Flag, and Circle Jerks paved the way for skate punk. Skate punk was pioneered in the 1980s by bands such as the Big Boys, Suicidal Tendencies, JFA, T.S.O.L., Drunk Injuns and Love Canal. Many early skate punk bands are part of the hardcore punk movement nardcore, which emerged in Oxnard, California. Skate punk band Bad Religion started the more melodic style of skate punk in 1988 with the band&#x27;s influential album &quot;Suffer&quot;. This melodic style of skate punk continued in the 1990s with bands like NOFX, Lagwagon, Pennywise, Face to Face, and No Use for a Name.

Skate punk broke into the mainstream during the 1990s with bands such as the Offspring and Blink-182. Other bands, like NOFX, Pennywise, Face to Face, MxPx and Bad Religion, achieved underground to moderate success. Many skate punk bands&#x27; songs were featured in &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s&quot; video games, a series that sold millions. Punk&#x27;s popularity continued in the early 2000s with many bands continuing to make albums that received a lot of attention. During the 2010s, later skate punk bands such as Trash Boat, Cerebral Ballzy, and Trash Talk, achieved underground success through the influence of previous skate punk bands.

==Characteristics==

Skate punk is also known as skate rock and skatecore. Noted by AllMusic for having &quot;high-energy&quot;, skate punk features fast tempos. Many of the original skate punk bands in the 1980s were hardcore punk bands. In the 1990s, this changed when more bands began to play a style of skate punk that sounded more like pop punk and standard punk rock than hardcore punk. 

Also a skater subculture, skate punk&#x27;s origins go back to skate culture and surf culture. Author Sharon M. Hannon noted skate punk is known for &quot;its fast guitars, driving bass lines, and surf music–style drums&quot;. According to Mark Lepage of &quot;Spin&quot; magazine, it often has a &quot;double-time hup-two-three-four beat&quot;. Skate punk music often features singing and vocal harmonies. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described skate punk as &quot;a sort of pop hardcore&quot;. Some skate punk music has lyrics that are about humor - &quot;mostly of the smartass variety&quot;. 

Much skate punk music features lead guitar playing, guitar riffs, and sometimes guitar solos. Skate punk is described by AllMusic as having &quot;thrashier guitars&quot; than regular punk rock. Blast beats and fast drumming are very common in skate punk. Skate punk features the fast tempos of hardcore punk and melodic hardcore, occasionally combining them with the catchy hooks of pop punk. Some skate punk bands play other genres of music; pop punk, funk metal, and hardcore punk are genres that are noted for being played by some skate punk bands. Skate punk paved the way for third-wave ska. Some skate punk bands, including NOFX and the Suicide Machines, also play ska punk. Some skate punk bands, including Suicidal Tendencies and Excel, also play thrash metal or crossover thrash.

==History==

===Predecessors (1970s and early 1980s)===

California punk bands like Black Flag, Adolescents, and Circle Jerks paved the way for skate punk with their &quot;fast and raw&quot; music, &quot;which replicated the feel of skating.&quot; 1970s punk bands like the Buzzcocks and 1980s punk bands like The Descendents made fast and catchy punk rock songs about teenage confusion, and also combined the aggression and speed of hardcore punk with melodies.

===Origins (1980s)===

Originally derived from hardcore punk, skate punk began in the early 1980s. The Big Boys and JFA are considered pioneers of skate punk. Bands such as Gang Green, Dayglo Abortions, Suicidal Tendencies, The Faction, Rich Kids on LSD, Tales of Terror and Agression, were among the first wave of skate punk bands. Johnny Loftus of &quot;AllMusic&quot; described early skate punk music as &quot;a confluence of punk&#x27;s anger and simplicity, the furious speed of hardcore, and defiantly smart-assed machismo&quot;. Many early skate punk bands are part of the hardcore punk movement nardcore, which emerged in Oxnard, California. Popular among skateboarders, 1980s hardcore punk bands with connections to skateboarding culture were labeled as &quot;skate punk&quot; - the origin of the term. Early skate punk bands are noted for creating the connection between punk rock and skateboarding. Mörizen &quot;Mofo&quot; Föche, vocalist of Drunk Injuns and former employee of the magazine &quot;Thrasher&quot;, is &quot;often credited with first coining the term &#x27;skate-punk&#x27;.&quot; Bad Religion&#x27;s 1988 album &quot;Suffer&quot; is seen by many as a highly influential landmark album in the skate punk genre. &quot;Suffer&quot; helped start the melodic style of skate punk that continued in the 1990s.

===Mainstream success (1990s and early 2000s)===

As skate punk became more popular during the 1990s, it changed into a more melodic genre. During this time, some bands experienced mainstream success and were featured at events such as the Warped Tour, which started in 1995. Prominent skate punk bands of the 1990s include Consumed, Good Riddance, Strung Out, NOFX, Goldfinger, Lagwagon, Guttermouth, Bodyjar, No Use for a Name, Face to Face, Slick Shoes, MxPx, Unwritten Law, Ten Foot Pole, Screeching Weasel, Bad Religion, the Offspring, and Pennywise.

Skate punk broke into the mainstream in 1994. The Offspring&#x27;s album &quot;Smash&quot;, released in 1994, launched the band into the mainstream. &quot;Smash&quot;, certified 6× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), sold at least 6.3 million copies in the United States and at least 5 million copies outside the United States. NOFX&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;Punk in Drublic&quot; was eventually certified gold by the RIAA on May 5, 2000. Unlike other 1990s punk rock bands, NOFX never signed to a major record label. Also, NOFX has not given permission for its music videos to be played on channels like MTV and VH1. Explaining this decision NOFX member said: &quot;We made the &#x27;Leave It Alone&#x27; video, and we decided not to send it to MTV. We just didn&#x27;t want to be a part of that machine, of that &#x27;punk wave.&#x27; I think it&#x27;s one of the best decisions we&#x27;ve ever made.&quot; California skate punk band Face to Face had local success with their song &quot;Disconnected&quot;, which was played often on California radio station KROQ-FM. With &quot;Disconnected&quot; constantly playing on KROQ-FM, Face to Face&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;Big Choice&quot; sold more than 100,000 copies.

Other skate punk bands achieved underground to moderate success. Pennywise&#x27;s 1993 album &quot;Unknown Road&quot; sold 100,000 copies within two years, according to Nielsen SoundScan, and helped bring the band underground popularity.

<doc id="229307" wikidata="Q7166" url="?curid=229307" title="Heilbronn (district)">
<text>Landkreis Heilbronn () is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in the north of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from north clockwise) Neckar-Odenwald, Hohenlohe, Schwäbisch Hall, Rems-Murr, Ludwigsburg, Enz, Karlsruhe and Rhein-Neckar. In the centre of it is the free-city of Heilbronn, which is its own separate administrative area.

==History==
The predecessor to the district is the &quot;Oberamt Heilbronn&quot;, which was created in 1803 when the previously Free Imperial City of Heilbronn was incorporated into the Electorate of Württemberg. In 1926, about half of the Oberamt (old district) of Weinsberg was added. In 1938, it was recognized as a district, and in addition to the previous Oberamt, parts of the dissolved Oberämter Neckarsulm, Brackenheim, Marbach and Besigheim were added. The city of Heilbronn was not included in the district. In 1973, the &quot;Landkreise&quot; (districts) were reorganized, and part of the dissolved districts of Sinsheim, Mosbach, Buchen and Schwäbisch Hall were added. Within the following two years 5 municipalities were incorporated into the city and therefore left the district, which got its current borders in 1975.

==Geography==
The main river in the district is the Neckar, which flows through the district from the south to the north. The western part of the district belongs to the landscape &quot;Kraichgau&quot;, the east to the &quot;Hohenloher Ebene&quot;, &quot;Kocher-Jagst-Ebene&quot;, and the &quot;Löwensteiner Berge&quot;.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms shows a clawless eagle, the symbol of the Counts of Lauffen, who ruled the area of the district in the 13th century.

<text>The Battle of Piedmont was fought June 5, 1864, in the village of Piedmont, Augusta County, Virginia. Union Maj. Gen. David Hunter engaged Confederates under Brig. Gen. William E. &quot;Grumble&quot; Jones north of Piedmont. After severe fighting, Jones was killed and the Confederates were routed. Hunter occupied Staunton on June 6 and soon began to advance on Lynchburg, destroying military stores and public property in his wake.

==Background==
The Battle of Piedmont resulted from Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s 1864 initiative to keep U.S. forces on the offensive and prevent Confederates from shuttling troops from one region to another. In the Shenandoah Valley, Grant had originally placed German-born general Franz Sigel in command, however, following Sigel&#x27;s defeat at New Market on May 15, Grant relieved him and placed Maj. Gen. David Hunter in command of the United States Army of the Shenandoah on May 21.

Hunter quickly regrouped his small army and ordered his troops to live off the bountiful farms of the Shenandoah Valley. He advanced up the Valley toward Staunton on May 26 against light opposition from the Confederates. Following New Market, the majority of the Confederate forces in the Valley joined the Army of Northern Virginia, leaving only Brig. Gen. John D. Imboden&#x27;s brigade and the Valley Reserves to confront Hunter. Imboden kept Robert E. Lee informed of Hunter&#x27;s movements, but could do little to slow Hunter with his meager forces. Hunter set his sights on Staunton, an important railroad and logistics center for the Confederacy.

The quick Union advance upon the heels of their defeat at New Market caught the Confederates off guard. Closely engaged with the Army of the Potomac, Lee turned to Brig. Gen. William E. &quot;Grumble&quot; Jones, acting-commander of the Confederate Department of Southwest Virginia and East Tennessee for assistance, instructing him to open communications with Imboden. Jones soon went to the Shenandoah with roughly 4,000 infantry and dismounted cavalrymen.

By June 3, the Union Army had reached Harrisonburg. Imboden had concentrated his forces at Mount Crawford on the south bank of the North River, blocking Hunter&#x27;s direct path to Staunton upon the Valley Turnpike. Imboden, a Valley native from Augusta County, established his headquarters at the Grattan House, where his force grew when the reinforcements began to arrive from Southwest Virginia.

On the morning of June 4, Hunter sent a diversionary force toward Mount Crawford while his main army headed east to Port Republic where he camped for the night. General Jones had arrived at the Grattan House and assumed command of the hastily assembled Confederate Army of the Valley District. When Confederate scouts reported Hunter&#x27;s flank march, Imboden suggested that they move to Mowry&#x27;s Hill in eastern Augusta to confront Hunter. According to Imboden, Jones agreed to march his infantry and dismounted cavalry to Mowry&#x27;s Hill in Eastern Augusta where they would confront Hunter on June 5. Jones ordered Imboden to lead all of the mounted troops toward Mount Meridian, a few miles south of Port Republic on the Staunton or East Road. Jones added that Imboden was to delay Hunter&#x27;s advance but instructed Imboden to avoid any serious confrontation when the Federals approached the next morning.

==Battle==
After spending a rainy night encamped on the southern outskirts of Port Republic, Hunter&#x27;s army marched southward on the Staunton Road toward Mount Meridian through the morning mist. Maj. Gen. Julius Stahel&#x27;s cavalry led the advance, driving back Imboden&#x27;s outposts. When Stahel&#x27;s advance regiment reached Mount Meridian, Imboden successfully counterattacked with the 18th Virginia Cavalry. Stahel fed reinforcements into the fight and quickly overwhelmed the Virginians. Imboden barely escaped capture and only the timely charge from the balance of his brigade, which included local reserves, saved the 18th Virginia from disaster. The Confederates then fell back slowly toward the village of Piedmont. Imboden expected to join forces with General Jones at Mowry&#x27;s Hill but was surprised to find him at Piedmont. The two commanders debated the situation, and then Jones (who ranked Imboden) decided to stand and fight.

Jones advanced a battalion of dismounted cavalry, convalescents, and detailed men several hundred yards in front of his left wing, backed by a section of horse artillery, and Stahel&#x27;s advance was stopped. Jones deployed his two brigades of infantry (his left wing) along the edge of a woodlot that ran from the Staunton (or East) Road to the high bluffs of the Middle River that anchored his left flank. He ordered Imboden to guard his extreme right flank with the cavalry. On Imboden&#x27;s immediate left, Brig. Gen. John C. Vaughn&#x27;s brigade of dismounted Tennessee and Georgia horsemen went into position. Vaughn&#x27;s left flank rested six hundred yards to the rear of Jones&#x27;s right wing, creating a gap in the center of his line. There he positioned two batteries, including Captain Marquis&#x27;s reserve artillery manned by 17- and 18-year-olds of Augusta County.

Hunter&#x27;s Chief of Staff, Colonel David Hunter Strother, described the battlefield: 
The enemy&#x27;s position was strong and well chosen. It was on a conclave of wooded hills commanding an open valley between and open, gentle slopes in front. On our right in advance of the village of Piedmont was a line of log and rail defenses very advantageously located in the edge of a forest and just behind the rise of a smooth, open hill so that troops moving over this hill could be mowed down by musketry from the works at short range and to prevent artillery from being used against them. The left flank of this palisade rested on a steep and impracticable bluff sixty feet high and washed at its base by the Shenandoah [Middle River].

At noon, Hunter&#x27;s infantry under the command of Brig. Gen. Jeremiah C. Sullivan advanced. Colonel Augustus Moor&#x27;s brigade drove in Jones&#x27;s advance line on the west side of the Staunton (East) Road, halting along the edge of a wooded lot opposite the one Jones&#x27;s Confederates were stationed in. Sullivan ordered an advance but the well-protected rebel infantry repulsed the effort. On the east side of the road, Colonel Joseph Thoburn&#x27;s brigade advanced through a wooded ravine toward Imboden&#x27;s position under heavy artillery fire. Thoburn withdrew to support the Union artillery when he saw Moor&#x27;s repulse. During these actions, the Union artillery under Captain Henry DuPont systematically silenced most of the Confederate guns. Only a few guns with Imboden on the extreme Confederate right remained active.

At this point, Jones decided to withdraw his left wing so that it was aligned with Vaughn and Imboden, but events soon changed his mind. Sullivan reinforced Moor with two regiments and ordered another attack, but was again repulsed. This time the Confederates counterattacked, but a stand by the 28th Ohio and some dismounted horsemen armed with Spencer repeating carbines, backed by a section of artillery, forced the Southerners to fall back to their breastworks. An emboldened Jones now rearranged his forces to launch a concerted attack against Moor&#x27;s battered brigade. Jones ordered Vaughn to advance the greater part of his brigade to the left wing. The 60th Virginia Infantry moved from its position in the edge of the woods covering the large gap in the center of his battle line. The Virginians ended up in a second line of battle behind the main Confederate line, leaving the gap completely undefended.

Jones&#x27;s concentration of troops against Moor&#x27;s brigade did not go unnoticed. The Federals spotted the gap on the right flank of Jones&#x27;s left wing, and Hunter ordered Thoburn&#x27;s brigade to attack the vulnerable Confederate position. Thoburn quickly advanced to within a few yards of the Confederate left before his men were spotted, and shattered the Southern flank. At the same time, Moor&#x27;s brigade joined the assault against the Confederate front. Jones attempted to retrieve the situation bringing up the Valley Reserves, who slowed Thoburn&#x27;s advance but were unable to throw it back. Jones dashed up to a small group of rallying Confederates and then charged toward the oncoming Union infantry. A Union bullet struck him in the head, killing Jones instantly. The Union forces drove the Confederates toward the bluffs of the Middle River, splitting the Confederate force into two halves. At the bluffs, the converging forces of Thoburn&#x27;s and Moor&#x27;s brigade, backed by some of Stahel&#x27;s Cavalry, captured nearly 1,000 unwounded Confederates. A section of Captain John McClanahan&#x27;s Virginia horse artillery stood its ground near the village of Piedmont, slowing the Union drive southward and barely evading capture.

On the Staunton (East) Road, the 1st New York Veteran Cavalry launched a vigorous pursuit of the beaten Confederates. However, another section of McClanahan&#x27;s battery and elements of Vaughn&#x27;s brigade not sent to the left hastily deployed along the road between the villages of Piedmont and New Hope. When the New Yorkers chased up the road after the fleeing Southerners, this Confederate rear guard opened fire devastating the Union cavalry and dampening their enthusiasm for any further pursuit. Although at least 1,500 Confederates had been lost, the rear guard action at New Hope allowed the remnants of the army to escape further damage. Vaughn learned that he was now the senior officer as a result of Jones&#x27;s death, but he was unfamiliar with the Shenandoah Valley and simply adopted Imboden&#x27;s recommendations. Hunter&#x27;s army rounded up the prisoners and tended to the wounded at Piedmont, where the Army of the Shenandoah camped for the night, having lost nearly 900 men killed and wounded. The next day, it became the first Union army to enter Staunton.

==Medal of Honor recipients==

Private Thomas Evans, 54th Pennsylvania Infantry, shot a Confederate officer rallying the Confederates, battled the color bearer of the 45th Virginia, and captured the flag from him.

Musician James Snedden, 54th Pennsylvania Infantry, picked up a rifle and joined the attack, captured Colonel Beuhring Jones, commander of the 1st Confederate infantry brigade.

Maj. Gen. Julius Stahel was struck by two bullets as he led his dismounted cavalry into the fight, had the wounds dressed at a field hospital, and returned to direct the final cavalry charge.

<text>Nicola Stilo (born 1956 in Italy), is a jazz and pop instrumentalist, specialising in flute and guitar.

Stilo began following Chet Baker in 1979, attending his concerts and recording sessions. Baker took him as part of his band for a tour of Italy the following year, and on subsequent tours, including to Brazil in 1985. After the last, Stilo stayed in Brazil for around a year before reuniting with Baker. Despite discouragement from Baker, who was a long-term drug addict, Stilo by this time had become addicted to heroin. Back together in Europe, Stilo commented: &quot;Maybe I made the choice just to live the same life he was doing, you know? [...] We were like brothers, maybe sometimes fighting, but really taking care of each other.&quot; They continued to play together, with Stilo on flute and guitar. Stilo wrote the music for Baker&#x27;s 1988 album &quot;Chet on Poetry&quot;; it &quot;ranged from slick Europop to funk to a graceful jazz waltz&quot;. He also played on the album. He appeared on film in the 1988 documentary &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Lost&quot;. After Baker&#x27;s death later that year, Stilo gave up heroin.

Stilo subsequently recorded with Toninho Horta and with his own group.

<text>The Messenger Stakes is an American harness racing event for 3-year-old pacing horses. It was organized in 1956 at Roosevelt Raceway in Westbury, New York (on suburban Long Island) to join with the Cane Pace and the Little Brown Jug to create the Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Pacers. The race is named in honor of Messenger (1780–1808), a horse foaled in England and later brought to the United States. As a sire, virtually all harness horses in the U.S. can be traced back to Messenger.

One of the preeminent events for harness racing horses in North America, the race was held annually at Roosevelt Raceway until it closed down in 1988. From 1988 to 1994, the race changed locations several times, from Yonkers Raceway (Yonkers, New York) to Freestate Raceway to Rosecroft Raceway (both in Maryland). In 1995, it moved to The Meadows Racetrack in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area. In 2004, the race was supposed to be moved back to Yonkers Raceway. However, due to construction at the track, the race was moved to Harrington Raceway in Delaware, where the event was held in 2004 and &#x27;05. The race moved back to Yonkers Raceway in November 2006. The 2015 edition was raced at Yonkers on September 5 for a total purse of US$500,000.

Much like the Little Brown Jug, the Messenger was raced in heat events, meaning a horse had to win an elimination heat and the final on the same day to be declared the winner. Starting from 2006 at Yonkers, there will be eliminations, if necessary, one week prior to the event.

<doc id="229340" wikidata="Q313801" url="?curid=229340" title="Emperor Higashiyama">
<text>, posthumously honored as , was the 113th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. Higashiyama&#x27;s reign spanned the years from 1687 through to his abdication in 1709 corresponding to the Genroku era of the Edo period. The previous hundred years of peace and seclusion in Japan had created relative economic stability. The arts flourished, including theater and architecture.

==Events of Higashiyama&#x27;s life==
===Early life===
Before Higashiyama&#x27;s ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (&quot;imina&quot;) was or Tomohito. Tomohito was born on October 21, 1675, and was the fifth son of Emperor Reigen; his birth mother was a lady-in-waiting named Matsuki Muneko. While Prince Tomohito was the son of a secondary consort, he was adopted by empress Takatsukasa Fusako (chief consort or Chūgū). Tomohito&#x27;s Imperial family lived with him in the Dairi of the Heian Palace. Events that took place before Tomohito became Crown Prince include a great flood that devastated Edo, a great famine that devastated Kyoto, and the &quot;Great Tenna Fire&quot; in Edo. The Shingon Buddhist temple Gokoku-ji was also founded in Edo where it remains today as one of the few sites in Tokyo that survived World War II. Tomohito-shinnō was proclaimed Crown prince in 1682, and given the pre-accession title of &quot;Go-no-miya&quot; (五宮). For the first time in over 300 years a ceremonial investiture was held for the occasion. A fire burned the Kyoto Imperial Palace to ashes in 1684 prompting reconstruction that took a year to complete. The effects from this fire on the Imperial family, if any, are unknown. Emperor Reigen&#x27;s brother, former-Emperor Go-Sai, died on March 26, 1685, and a great comet was observed crossing the night sky.

===Reign===
Prince Tomohito acceded to the throne on May 2, 1687, as Emperor when his father abdicated in his favor, the era&#x27;s name was changed from &quot;Jōkyō&quot; to &quot;Genroku&quot; to mark this event. While he held the political title of &quot;Emperor&quot;, it was in name only as the shoguns of the Tokugawa family controlled Japan. Initially, Emperor Reigen continued to rule in Higashiyama&#x27;s name as a Cloistered Emperor as had been done in the Heian period. While this move caused trouble by provoking the ruling shogunate, Higashiyama&#x27;s gentle character helped to improve relations with the Shōgun. This warmed relationship caused imperial property to be increased, and repairs carried out on Imperial mausoleums. Reigen meanwhile lived out his retirement in the &quot;Sentō-gosho&quot; (the palace for an ex-Emperor), and is now known for being the last &quot;Cloistered Emperor&quot; of Japan. On December 20, 1688, the esoteric &quot;Daijō-sai&quot; ceremony was revived because of the shogunate&#x27;s insistence. This Shinto ritual had been in abeyance for over a century, and is performed only once by the emperor in the period of the enthronement ceremonies.

* 1688 (&quot;Genroku gannen&quot;): The Tokugawa shogunate revised the code of conduct for funerals (&quot;Fuku-kiju-ryō&quot;), which incorporated a code of conduct for mourning as well.
* September 16, 1689 (&quot;Genroku 2&quot;): German physician Engelbert Kaempfer arrives at Dejima for the first time. &quot;Bakufu&quot; policy in this era was designed to marginalize the influence of foreigners; and Kaempfer had to present himself as &quot;Dutch&quot; in dealings with the Japanese. Regardless of this minor subterfuge, an unintended and opposite consequence of &quot;sakoku&quot; was to enhance the value and significance of a very small number of thoughtful observers like Kaempfer, whose writings document what he learned or discovered first-hand. Kaempfer&#x27;s published accounts and unpublished writings provided a unique and useful perspective for Orientalists and Japanologists in the 19th century; and his work continues to be rigorously examined by modern researchers today.
* 1695 (&quot;Genroku 8, 8th month&quot;): Minting begun of &quot;Genroku&quot; coinage. The shogunate placed the Japanese character &quot;gen&quot; (元) on the obverse of copper coins, the same character used today in China for the yuan. There is no connection between those uses, however.
* 1695 (&quot;Genroku 8, 11th month&quot;): First kennel is established for stray dogs in Edo. In this context, Tokugawa Tsunayoshi comes to be nicknamed the .
* 1697 (&quot;Genroku 10&quot;): The fourth official map of Japan was made in this year, but it was considered to be inferior to the previous one—which had been ordered in 1605 (&quot;Shōhō 1&quot;) and completed in 1639 (&quot;Kan&#x27;ei 16&quot;). This &quot;Genroku&quot; map was corrected in 1719 (&quot;Kyōhō 4&quot;) by the mathematician Tatebe Katahiro (1644–1739), using high mountain peaks as points of reference, and was drawn to a scale of 1:21,600.
* 1697 (&quot;Genroku 10&quot;): Great fire in Edo.
* 1697 (&quot;Genroku 11&quot;): Another great fire in Edo. A new hall is constructed inside the enclosure of the Edo temple of Kan&#x27;ei-ji (which is also known as Tōeizan Kan&#x27;ei-ji or &quot;Hiei-san of the east&quot; after the principal temple of the Tendai Buddhist sect—that is to say, after the temple of Enryaku-ji at Mount Hiei near to Heian-kyō).
* 1703 (&quot;Genroku 15, 14th day of the 12th month&quot;): when the Akō Incident took place, in which a band of Forty-seven &quot;rōnin&quot; (leaderless samurai) avenged the death of their master Asano Naganori, due to the bloodshed, Emperor Higashiyama nearly withdrew the imperial will.
* 1703 (&quot;Genroku 16, 5th month&quot;): First performance of Chikamatsu Monzaemon&#x27;s play The Love Suicides at Sonezaki.
* 1703 (&quot;Genroku 16, 28th day of the 11th month&quot;): The Great Genroku earthquake shook Edo and parts of the &quot;shōgun&quot;″s castle collapsed. The following day, a vast fire spread throughout the city. Parts of Honshū&#x27;s coast were battered by tsunami, and 200,000 people were either killed or injured.
* October 28, 1707 (&quot;Hōei 4, 14th day of the 10th month&quot;): 1707 Hōei earthquake. The city of Osaka suffers tremendously because of a very violent earthquake.
* November 15, 1707 (&quot;Hōei 4, 22nd day of the 10th month&quot;): An eruption of Mount Fuji; cinders and ash fell like rain in Izu, Kai, Sagami, and Musashi.
* 1708 (&quot;Hōei 5&quot;): The shogunate introduces new copper coins into circulation; and each coin is marked with the &quot;Hōei&quot; nengō name (&quot;Hōei Tsubo&quot;).
* 1708 (&quot;Hōei 5, 8th day of the 3rd month&quot;): There was a great fire in Heian-kyō.
* 1708 (&quot;Hōei 5, 8th month&quot;): Italian missionary Giovanni Sidotti landed in Yakushima, where he was promptly arrested.
* 1709 (&quot;Hōei 6&quot;): &quot;Shōgun&quot; Tsunayoshi appoints commission to repair and restore Imperial mausoleums.
* 1709 (&quot;Hōei 6, 4th month&quot;): Tokugawa Ienobu, Tsunayoshi&#x27;s nephew, becomes the 6th &quot;shōgun&quot; of the Edo bakufu. and Emperor Nakamikado accedes to the throne.
* July 27, 1709 (&quot;Hōei 6, 21st day of the 6th month&quot;): Emperor Higashiyama abdicated and the throne passed to his son.
* January 16, 1710 (&quot;Hōei 6, 17th day of the 12th month&quot;): Higashiyama died.

Higashiyama is among those enshrined in the Imperial mausoleum, &quot;Tsuki no wa no misasagi,&quot; at Sennyū-ji in Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto. Also enshrined in this location are this emperor&#x27;s immediate Imperial predecessors since Emperor Go-Mizunoo – Meishō, Go-Kōmyō, Go-Sai and Reigen. Higashiyama&#x27;s immediate Imperial successors, including Nakamikado, Sakuramachi, Momozono, Go-Sakuramachi and Go-Momozono, are enshrined here as well.

==Eras of reign==
The years of Higashiyama&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;.
* &quot;Jōkyō&quot; (1684–1688)
* &quot;Genroku&quot; (1688–1704)
* &quot;Hōei&quot; (1704–1711)

==Genealogy== 
Higashiyama&#x27;s family included at least 11 children.

===Spouse===

===Concubines===
===Issue===
==Fictional portrayals==
Higashiyama appears under the name of Tomohito in the novel &quot;The Samurai&#x27;s Wife&quot; by author Laura Joh Rowland. In the novel, detective Sano Ichiro is sent to investigate the murder of an important official in the Imperial Court. Tomohito is labelled as a suspect, and is portrayed as a childish oaf at the start of the novel. He is later revealed to be the instigator behind a coming revolution against the Tokugawa regime, so he can seize control of Japan himself. However, his plan fails, and he is once again placed in the Imperial Palace, where he seems to have accepted his fate to never leave the palace.

<doc id="229347" wikidata="Q334076" url="?curid=229347" title="Emperor Ōgimachi">
<text>was the 106th Emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. He reigned from November 17, 1557, to his abdication on December 17, 1586, corresponding to the transition between the Sengoku period of the Muromachi bakufu and the dawn of the new Azuchi–Momoyama period. His personal name was Michihito (方仁).

==Genealogy==
Ōgimachi was the first son of Emperor Go-Nara.
* Lady-in-waiting (&quot;Naishi-no-Suke&quot;): Madenokōji (Fujiwara) Fusako (万里小路 房子; d.1580) later Seiko-in (清光院), Madenokōji Hidefusa&#x27;s daughter
** Second daughter: Princess Eikō (1540–1551; 永高女王)
** Third daughter (b.1543)
**Eldest son: , also known as Prince Sanehito and posthumously named Yōkwōin &quot;daijō-tennō&quot;. Masahito&#x27;s eldest son was who became Emperor Go-Yōzei. Go-Yōzei elevated the rank of his father, even though his father&#x27;s untimely death made this impossible in life. In this manner, Go-Yōzei himself could enjoy the polite fiction of being the son of an emperor.
** Daughter (1562–67, mother speculated)
* Lady-in-waiting (&quot;Naishi-no-Suke&quot;): Asukai Masatsuna&#x27;s daughter
** daughter: ??? (春齢女王; 1549–1569)
** daughter: Princess Eisho (永尊女王; 1563–1571)
* Lady-in-waiting (&quot;Naishi-no-Suke&quot;): Dai-Naishi (大典侍), Madenokōji Katafusa&#x27;s daughter
** First daughter (1539–1543)

==Events of Ōgimachi&#x27;s life==
Ōgimachi became Emperor upon the death of Emperor Go-Nara.

* 1560 (&quot;Eiroku 3, 1st month&quot;): Ōgimachi was proclaimed emperor. The ceremonies of coronation were made possible because they were paid for by Mōri Motonari and others.
* 1560 (&quot;Eiroku 3, 5th month&quot;): Imagawa Yoshimoto led the armies of the province of Suruga against the Owari; at the Battle of Okehazama, his forces fought against Oda Nobunaga, but Imagawa&#x27;s army was vanquished and he was slain. Then Nobunaga took over the province of Owari. Tokugawa Ieyasu took over the province of Mikawa and made himself master of Okazaki Castle.
* 1564 (&quot;Eiroku 7&quot;): Oda Nobunaga completed the conquest of Mino; he built a new castle at Gifu.
* 1568 (&quot;Eiroku 11, 2nd month&quot;): Ashikaga Yoshihide became &quot;shōgun&quot;.
* 1568 (&quot;Eiroku 11, 9th month&quot;): &quot;Shōgun&quot; Yoshihide died from a contagious disease.
The finances of the emperor and his court were greatly strained. The authority of the Imperial Court also began to fall, but this trend reversed after Oda Nobunaga entered Kyoto in a show of allegiance but which also indicated that the Emperor had the Oda clan&#x27;s support. Frequently using the Emperor as a mediator when fighting enemies, Nobunaga worked to unify the disparate elements to Japan. However, by around 1573, Nobunaga began demanding the Emperor&#x27;s abdication, but the Emperor refused.

Before political power was transferred to Toyotomi Hideyoshi, in order to take advantage of Ōgimachi&#x27;s authority, the power of the Imperial Family was increased. In this way, Hideyoshi and the Imperial Family entered into a mutually beneficial relationship.

In January of the year Tenshō 14 (1586), the regent had the Golden Tea Room brought to Kyoto Imperial Palace to host the emperor there.

In 1586, Emperor Ōgimachi abdicated in favor of his grandson, Imperial Prince Katahito (周仁親王), who became the Emperor Go-Yōzei. Ōgimachi retired to the Sentō Palace. On February 6, 1593, he died.

During Ōgimachi&#x27;s reign, with the assistance of Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the imperial family was able to halt the political, financial, and cultural decline it had been in since the Ōnin War, and began a time of recovery.

Ōgimachi is enshrined with other emperors at the imperial tomb called &quot;Fukakusa no kita no misasagi&quot; (深草北陵) in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto.

===Kugyō===
&quot;Kugyō&quot; (公卿) is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court&#x27;s actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Ōgimachi&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:

* &quot;Kampaku&quot; (Regent for an adult Emperor):
** Konoe (Fujiwara) Sakihisa (1554–1568)
** Nijō (Fujiwara) Haruyoshi (1569–1578)

** Ichijō (Fujiwara) Uchimoto (1581–1585)
** Nijō (Fujiwara) Akizane (1585)
** Hashiba (Fujiwara &gt; Toyotomi) Hideyoshi (1585–1592)
* &quot;Daijō-daijin&quot; (Chancellor):
** Konoe (Fujiwara) Sakihisa (1582)

** Kujō (Fujiwara) Kanetaka (1574–1576)
** Ichijō (Fujiwara) Uchimoto (1576–1577)
** Oda (Taira) Nobunaga (1577–1578)
** Nijō (Fujiwara) Akizane (1579–1585)
** Imadegawa (Fujiwara) Harusue (1585–1595)

** Tokudaiji (Fujiwara) Kinfusa (1580)
** Imadegawa (Fujiwara) Harusue (second time, 1580)
** Konoe (Fujiwara) Nobusuke (1580–1585)
** Hashiba (Fujiwara &gt; Toyotomi) Hideyoshi (1585–1587)

==Eras of Ōgimachi&#x27;s reign==

* &quot;Kōji&quot; (1555–1558)
* &quot;Eiroku&quot; (1558–1570)
* &quot;Genki&quot; (1570–1573)

<text>The World Figure Skating Championships are an annual figure skating competition generally held in March and sanctioned by the International Skating Union (ISU). Medals are awarded in men&#x27;s singles, women&#x27;s singles, pair skating, and ice dance. The World Championships are considered the most prestigious annual event in the world of figure skating, second only to the Olympics.

The corresponding competition for junior-level skaters is the World Junior Championships. The corresponding competition for senior-level synchronized skating is the World Synchronized Skating Championships and for junior-level, the World Junior Synchronized Skating Championships.

The 2025 World Championships will be held in Boston, Massachusetts, in the United States, and the 2026 World Championships will be held in Prague, Czech Republic.

== History ==
The International Skating Union formed in 1892 to govern international competition in speed and figure skating. The first championship, known as the Championship of the Internationale Eislauf-Vereingung, was held in Saint Petersburg, Russia, in 1896. There were four competitors and the winner of the event was Gilbert Fuchs of Germany.

The championships were presumed to be all-male since competitive skating was generally viewed as a male sport. However, there were no specific rules regarding the gender of competitors. In 1902, Madge Syers of Great Britain entered the championships and won the silver medal. The 1903 ISU Congress considered gender issues, but passed no new rules. The 1905 ISU Congress established a second-class women&#x27;s competition called the ISU Championships rather than the World Championships, and winners were known as ISU champions and not world champions. Men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s events were generally held separately. The first women&#x27;s competition was held in Davos, Switzerland, in 1906; the event was won by Syers.

The first pair skating competition was held in Saint Petersburg in 1908, despite pairs competition being illegal in some countries and considered indecent. Early championships for both women and pairs, previously titled &quot;ISU Championships&quot;, were retroactively given World Championship status in 1924.

In the early years, judges were invited by the host country and were often natives to that country. At the 1927 women&#x27;s event in Oslo, Norway, three of the five judges were Norwegian; the three judges awarded first place to Norwegian competitor Sonja Henie, while the Austrian and German judges placed defending champion Herma Szabo of Austria first. The controversial result stood, giving Henie her first world title, but the controversy led to the ISU introducing a new rule that allowed no more than one judge per country on the panel.

The 1930 World Championships in New York City were the first to be held outside Europe and combined all three competitions into one event for the first time. Ice dance entered the program officially in 1952.

Until 1959, national teams were allowed to field multiple competitors in each discipline; for example the United Kingdom entered six skaters in the ladies&#x27; singles competition in 1948, and five skaters represented the United States in each singles discipline in 1951. Beginning in 1960, the number of participants per country was limited to a maximum of three per discipline.

In 1967, all events at the World Championships, other than compulsory figures and ice dance, were held indoors.

Compulsory figures were removed from the World Championships in 1991.

The 6.0 system was used for judging up to and including the 2004 event, after which the ISU Judging System was instituted.

Every four years, because the World Championships take place around a month after the Winter Olympics, a large proportion of Olympic medalists tend to be absent from the competition. Many skaters need time to rest due to physical and mental exhaustion, and some Olympic medalists choose to cash in on their recent success by turning professional.

===Cancellations===
The World Figure Skating Championships have been cancelled 16 times in the competition&#x27;s history: from 1915 through 1921 due to World War I; from 1940 through 1946 due to World War II; in 1961 as a result of the loss of the entire U.S. Figure Skating team in the crash of Sabena Flight 548; and in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The 2011 Championships, originally due to be held in Tokyo, Japan, were considered for cancellation after the Japan earthquake and tsunami, but were instead moved to Moscow, Russia.

==Eligibility and qualifying==
Skaters may compete at the World Championships if they represent a member nation of the International Skating Union and are selected by their federation. Pairs and ice dance partnerships composed of skaters of different nationalities are not allowed to compete under two flags; they are required to choose one country and obtain the other country&#x27;s permission.

Member nations select their entries according to their own criteria. Some countries rely on the results of their national championships while others have more varied criteria, which may include success at certain international events or specific technical requirements. All of the selected skaters must meet the ISU&#x27;s age and TES requirements.

===Age eligibility===
Age restrictions have changed throughout the history of the World Championships. Originally there were no any age restrictions at all. For example, Sonja Henie of Norway (three-time Olympic champion and ten-time World champion in women&#x27;s singles) debuted at the World Championships in 1924, at the age of 11. In mid-1990s International Skating Union (ISU) imposed age limits in order to protect young athletes from serious injuries, especially in women&#x27;s singles and pair skating. Starting from 1996–97 season, skaters had to be at least 15 years old before July 1 of the previous year. However, there were some exceptions during few following seasons. One exception allowed those who already had skated in senior events to stay at that level. Most notably, Tara Lipinski from the United States (1998 Olympic champion in women&#x27;s singles who debuted at the World Championships in 1996 at the age of 13) was allowed to participate at the 1997 World Championships where she won a gold medal at the age of 14. That exception expired naturally after a couple of seasons. There was also an exception that skaters who had won medals at the World Junior Championships were eligible to compete as seniors at the ISU Championships. For example, Sarah Hughes from the United States (2002 Olympic champion in women&#x27;s singles) won silver medal at the 1999 World Junior Championships and thus was allowed to participate at the 1999 World Championships at the age of 13. That exception lasted through the 1999–2000 season, which was also the first season that Junior Worlds were moved from November–December to early March.

At the ISU Congress held in Phuket, Thailand, in June 2022, members of the ISU Council accepted a proposal to gradually increase the minimum age limit for senior competition to 17 years old beginning from the 2024–25 season. To avoid forcing skaters who had already competed in the senior category to return to juniors, the age limit remained unchanged during the 2022–23 season, before increasing to 16 years old during the 2023–24 season, and then will increase to 17 years old during the 2024–25 season.

===Minimum technical scores===
Since 2010, only skaters who have reached minimum technical elements scores (TES) in the short and free programs at a prior international event are allowed to compete at the World Championships. The short and free scores may be attained at different international events in the ongoing or preceding season. After an ISU congress voted to eliminate the qualifying rounds, the TES minimums were raised for the 2013 World Championships.

===Number of entries===
Each national federation is entitled to send one entry per discipline. Depending on their results at the previous year&#x27;s competition, some countries are allowed to send a second or third entry. If a country has only one entry, that skater/team must place in the top ten to earn a second entry and in the top two to earn three entries to next year&#x27;s championships. If a country has two or three entries, their combined placement (best two) must be 28 or less to keep two entries for their country, and 13 or fewer to qualify three entries. All skaters who qualify for the free segment but place 16th or lower receive 16 placement points. All skaters who compete in the short segment but do not qualify for the free receive 18 placement points. There are exceptions if skaters are forced to withdraw in the middle of the competition due to a medical emergency or equipment problems – they are not considered as entered for the purpose of entry quotas&#x27; determination for next year&#x27;s competition if they did not start or finish the free segment, but were among the top 10 in the short segment. Entries do not carry over and so countries must continue to earn their second or third spot every year.

<doc id="229358" wikidata="Q555520" url="?curid=229358" title="Emperor Kōmyō">
<text>(11 January 1322 – 26 July 1380) was the second of the Emperors of Northern Court, although he was the first to be supported by the Ashikaga Bakufu. According to pre-Meiji scholars, his reign spanned the years from 1336 through 1348.

==Genealogy==
His personal name was Yutahito (豊仁), second son of Emperor Go-Fushimi. His mother was Neishi (寧子), the daughter of (西園寺公衡)

*Naishi: Ogimachi Sanjo Sanemi’s daughter
**daughter: Jogakuin-dono (長照院; d.1422)
**daughter
*Naishi: Mikawa-no-kami’s daughter
**son: Shuson (周尊)

==Events of Kōmyō&#x27;s life==
In his own lifetime, Kōmyō and those around him believed that he occupied the Chrysanthemum Throne from 20 September 1336 to 18 November 1348.

When Ashikaga Takauji rebelled against Emperor Go-Daigo&#x27;s Kenmu Restoration and entered Kyōto in 1336, Go-Daigo fled to Enryaku-ji on Mount Hiei. Despite lacking the sacred treasures, Prince Yutahito was enthroned as emperor, beginning the Northern Court. On the 12th month, 21st day, Go-Daigo escaped to Yoshino, founding the Southern Court.

On 18 November 1348, he abdicated in favor of the eldest son of his older brother, the former claimant to the throne Emperor Kōgon, who became Emperor Sukō.

In April 1352, taking advantage of the Kan&#x27;ō Disturbance, a family feud in the Ashikaga clan, the Southern Emperor Emperor Go-Murakami entered Kyoto, capturing it and carrying away Kōmyō along with Emperor Kōgon, Emperor Sukō, and the Crown Prince Tadahito. They all ended up finally in Anau, the location of the Southern Court.

In the Shōhei Reunification, Kōmyō and his companions were placed under house arrest in Yamato Province, in what is today the village of Nishiyoshino, Yoshino District, Nara. In 1355, returning to Kyōto, he entered a monastery.

* 26 July 1380 (&quot;Kōryaku 2, 24th day of the 6th month&quot;): The former emperor died at age 60.

==Eras of Kōmyō&#x27;s reign==
The years of Kōmyō&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;.

<text>was the 95th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. His reign spanned the years from 1308 through 1318.

==Genealogy==
Before his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (his &quot;imina&quot;) was Tomihito&quot;-shinnō&quot; (富仁親王).

He was the fourth son of the 92nd Emperor, Fushimi. He belonged to the &quot;Jimyōin-tō&quot; branch of the Imperial Family.

*Consort: Ogimachi Michiko (正親町実子) later Senkomon&#x27;in (宣光門院, 1297–1360), Ogimachi Saneakira&#x27;s daughter
** First Daughter: Imperial Princess Hisako (1318–1358; 寿子内親王) later Kianmon-in (徽安門院), married Emperor Kogon
** Second Son: Imperial Prince Nobunaga (業永親王; 1327–1353) later Imperial Prince priest Genshi (源性入道親王)
** Third son: Imperial Prince Naohito (直仁親王; 1335–1398)
** Daughter: Imperial Princess Noriko (儀子内親王; d. 1348)
** Priest Shōgoin
** Daughter married to Kazan&#x27;in clan
*Consort: Ichijo-no-Tsubone (d. 1325), Ogimachi Saneakira&#x27;s daughter
** First Son: Imperial Prince Priest Kakuyo (1320–1382; 覚誉法親王)
*Lady-in-waiting: Wamuro Yoriko (葉室頼子), Wamuro Yorito&#x27;s daughter
** Fifth Daughter: Imperial Princess Noriko (祝子内親王) – Nun
** Princess

==Events of Hanazono&#x27;s life==
Tomihito&quot;-shinnō&quot; became emperor upon the death of his second cousin, the Daikakuji-tō Emperor Go-Nijō.
* Tokuji 3, in the 8th month (1308): In the 8th year of Go-Nijo&quot;-tennō&quot; reign (後二条天皇八年), the emperor died at the young age of 24; and the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by his cousin. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Hanazono is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).
* Tokuji 3, in the 10th month (1308): The nengō was changed to Enkyō to mark the accession of Emperor Hanazono.

Hanazono&#x27;s father, the retired-Emperor Fushimi, and Hanazono&#x27;s brother, the retired-Emperor Go-Fushimi, both exerted influence as cloistered emperors during this reign.

In these years, negotiations between the Kamakura Bakufu and the two imperial lines resulted in an agreement to alternate the throne between the two lines every 10 years (the Bumpō Agreement). This agreement was not long-lasting. The negotiated provisions would soon be broken by Hanazono&#x27;s successor.

In 1318, he abdicated to his second cousin, the Daikakuji-tō Emperor Go-Daigo, who was Nijō&#x27;s brother.

After his abdication, he raised his nephew, the future Northern Pretender Emperor Kōgon.
In 1335, he became a Buddhist monk of the Zen sect, and under his sponsorship, his palace became the temple of Myōshin-ji, now the largest network in Rinzai Buddhism. Many places and institutions in the area are named for him, including Hanazono University (the Rinzai university) and Hanazono Station.

He died in 1348. Hanazono&#x27;s imperial tomb is known as &quot;Jurakuin no ue no misasagi&quot;; it is located in Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto.

He excelled at waka composition, and was an important member of the Kyōgoku School. He also left behind a diary, called Hanazono-in-Minki (Imperial Chronicles of the Flower Garden Temple or &quot;Hanazono-in&quot;) (花園院宸記). He was a very religious and literate person, never missing his prayers to the Amitabha Buddha.

===Kugyō===
 is a collective term for the very few most powerful noble men attached to the imperial court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court&#x27;s actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Hanazono&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:
* &quot;Sesshō&quot;, Kujō Moronori, 1308
* &quot;Sesshō&quot;, Takatsukasa Fuyuhira, 1308–1311
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Takatsukasa Fuyuhira, 1311–1313
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Konoe Iehira, 1313–1315
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Takatsukasa Fuyuhira, 1315–1316
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Nijō Michihira, 1316–1318
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;
* &quot;Nadaijin&quot;
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;

==Eras of Hanazono&#x27;s reign==
The years of Hanazono&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;.
* &quot;Tokuji&quot; (1306–1308)
* &quot;Enkyō&quot; (1308–1311)
* &quot;Ōchō&quot; (1311–1312)
* &quot;Shōwa&quot; (1312–1317)
* &quot;Bumpō&quot; (1317–1319)

==Events of Kameyama&#x27;s life==
In 1258, he became Crown Prince at age 9.

Other names Emperor Kameyama had were:
*Kongogen (金剛源) – his name as a monk
*Zenrinji-dono (禅林寺殿) – Literally &quot;Lord Zen-Temple&quot; From the fact that he had a Zen temple in the north wing of his Imperial Villa
*Madenokō-ji-dono (from his residence)
*Bun&#x27;ō Kōtei (From the era name; Kōtei is another word for Emperor)
The name Kameyama comes from the location of his tomb.

* 9 January 1260 (&quot;Shōgen 1, 26th day of the 11th month&quot;): In the 14th year of Go-Fukakusa&quot;-tennō&quot;″s reign (後深草天皇十四年), the emperor abdicated; and the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by his younger brother. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Kameyama is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).
In 1263, during the Kamakura Rebellion, the 6th &quot;shōgun&quot;, Imperial Prince Munetaka (eldest son of Emperor Go-Saga) was recalled from Kamakura to be replaced by his son Imperial Prince Koreyasu (age 2).

In 1265 a delegation sent by Kublai Khan, ruler of the Mongol Empire, arrived. On its way to Japan, they looted islands. The Mongols invited Japan to submit to the rule of Kublai. The Emperor and the Imperial Court suggested compromise, but they were ignored by the shogun in Kamakura. The Mongol delegation was sent back.

In 1274, abdicating to his son, Emperor Go-Uda, he began his reign as cloistered emperor.

During his time as cloistered emperor, the Mongols invaded the second time. Kameyama personally prayed at the Grand Shrine of Ise. On 15 August 1281, Kameyama-Jokō asked for Amaterasu intervention on behalf of Japan.

However, the Bakufu watched Kameyama with suspicion, and in 1287, encouraged Emperor Go-Uda to abdicate, and pushed for the enthronement of Emperor Go-Fukakusa&#x27;s son, who became Emperor Fushimi. Kameyama&#x27;s cloistered rule was suspended by this.

Later, Imperial Prince Hisa&#x27;aki, Emperor Go-Fukakusa&#x27;s son, became &quot;shōgun&quot; strengthening the position of the Jimyōin-tō. This caused Kameyama to become despondent, and in 1289 he entered the priesthood, joining the Zen sect. Because of this, Zen Buddhism slowly penetrated into the Court Nobility.

In 1291, he helped establish the Buddhist temple Nanzen-ji in Kyōto.
In 1305, he died. Emperor Kameyama is enshrined at Kameyama no &quot;Misasagi&quot; at Tenryū-ji in Kyoto; and this Imperial mausoleum is maintained by the Imperial Household.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Kameyama&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:

* &quot;Kampaku&quot; (Regent for an adult Emperor):
** Takatsukasa (Fujiwara) Kanehira (1255–1261)
** Nijō (Fujiwara) Yoshizane (1261–1265)
** Ichijō (Fujiwara) Sanetsune (1265–1267)
** Konoe (Fujiwara) Motohira (1267–1268†)
** Takatsukasa (Fujiwara) Mototada (1269–1273)
** Kujō (Fujiwara) Tadaie (1273–1274, continues as sesshō for Emperor Go-Uda)

* &quot;Daijō-daijin&quot; (Chancellor):
** Saionji (Fujiwara) Kinsuke (1262)

* &quot;Sadaijin&quot; (Minister of the Left):
** Saionji (Fujiwara) Kinsuke (1259–1261)
** Tōin &quot;Yamashina&quot; (Fujiwara) Saneo (1261–1263)
** Ichijō (Fujiwara) Sanetsune (1263–1265)
** Konoe (Fujiwara) Motohira (1265–1268)
** Takatsukasa (Fujiwara) Mototada (1269)
** Ichijō (Fujiwara) Ietsune (1269–1275)

** Tōin &quot;Yamashina&quot; (Fujiwara) Saneo (1258–1261)
** Konoe (Fujiwara) Motohira (1261–1265)
** Takatsukasa (Fujiwara) Mototada (1265–1269)
** Ichijō (Fujiwara) Ietsune (1269)
** Kasannoin (Fujiwara) Michimasa (1269–1271)
** Nijō (Fujiwara) Morotada (1271–1276)

* &quot;Naidaijin&quot; (Minister of the Center):

** Kasannoin (Fujiwara) Michimasa (1269)
** Nakanoin (Minamoto) Michinari (1269)
** Nijō (Fujiwara) Morotada (1269–1271)

<doc id="229373" wikidata="Q212428" url="?curid=229373" title="Gulf of Tonkin">
<text>The Gulf of Tonkin is a gulf at the northwestern portion of the South China Sea, located off the coasts of Tonkin (northern Vietnam) and South China. It has a total surface area of . It is defined in the west and northwest by the northern coastline of Vietnam down to the Cồn Cỏ district, in the north by China&#x27;s Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and to the east by the Leizhou Peninsula and Hainan Island.

English sources from the People&#x27;s Republic of China refer to the Gulf of Tonkin as Beibu Wan.

==Description and etymology==
The name &quot;Tonkin&quot;, written &quot;&quot; in chữ Hán characters and in the Vietnamese alphabet, means &quot;eastern capital&quot;, and is the former toponym for Hanoi, the present capital of Vietnam. It is not to be confused with Tokyo, which is also written &quot;&quot; and also means &quot;eastern capital&quot;. During the French colonial era, the northern region of today’s Vietnam was called &quot;Tonkin&quot;.

&quot;Bắc Bộ&quot; is the native Vietnamese name of Tonkin, which is the nowadays region of Northern Vietnam. The bay&#x27;s Vietnamese and Chinese names – and , respectively – both mean &quot;Northern Bay&quot;.

The Gulf of Tonkin is a relatively shallow portion of the Pacific Ocean; the majority of the gulf&#x27;s ocean floor is less than in depth, and no part of the gulf is submerged in more than of water.

==History==
===Gulf of Tonkin incident===

On 4 August 1964, United States President Lyndon B. Johnson claimed that North Vietnamese forces had twice attacked American destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin. Known today as the Gulf of Tonkin Incident, this event spawned the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution of 7 August 1964, ultimately leading to open war between North Vietnam and South Vietnam. It furthermore foreshadowed the major escalation of the Vietnam War in South Vietnam, which began with the landing of US regular combat troops at Da Nang in 1965.
===Maritime border issue in the Gulf of Tonkin===
On December 25, 2000, Vietnam and China signed &quot;an Agreement on the Delimitation of the Gulf of Tonkin&quot;. An Agreement took effect on June 30, 2004, officially defining the maritime border between the two countries in the Gulf of Tonkin.

On March 1, 2024, China issued a “Declaration on the baselines of the territorial waters in the northern part of the Gulf of Tonkin”. Vietnam calls on China to respect international law. One year later, in February 2025, Vietnam also announced baseline for determining its territorial waters width in the Gulf of Tonkin.

<doc id="229376" wikidata="Q357261" url="?curid=229376" title="Emperor Takakura">
<text>was the 80th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. His reign spanned the years from 1168 through 1180.

==Genealogy==
Before his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (his &quot;imina&quot;) was Norihito&quot;-shinnō&quot; (憲仁親王). 

Takakura was the fourth son of Emperor Go-Shirakawa, and thus uncle to his predecessor, Emperor Rokujō. His mother was Empress Dowager Taira no Shigeko, the younger sister of Taira no Tokiko, the concubine of Taira no Kiyomori. His empress consort was Taira no Tokuko (later Empress Dowager Kenrei), the regent of Taira no Kiyomori, and thus his first cousin (as his mother and Tokuko&#x27;s mothers were sisters).

* Empress consort: Taira no Tokuko (平徳子) – later Kenreimon-in
** First Son: Imperial Prince Tokihito (言仁親王) – later Emperor Antoku

* Lady-in-waiting: Bōmon Shokushi (坊門殖子; 1157–1228) later Shichijō-in (七条院), Bomon Nobutaka&#x27;s daughter
** Second son: Imperial Prince Morisada (守貞親王; 1179–1223) – later Go-Takakura In (後高倉院) – father of Emperor Go-Horikawa
** Fourth son: Imperial Prince Takahira (尊成親王) – later Emperor Go-Toba

* Consort: Konoe Michiko (近衛通子; b. 1163) or Rokujō-no-tsubone (六条局), Konoe Motozane’s daughter.

* Lady-in-waiting: Horikawa Toyoko (堀河豊子) or Azechi-Naishi (按察典侍), Horikawa Yorisada’s daughter
** Third daughter: Imperial Princess Kiyoko (潔子内親王; b. 1179) – Saigū of Ise

* Court Lady: Taira no Noriko (平範子) or Shōshō-Naishi (少将内侍), Taira Yoshisuke’s daughter
** Third son: Imperial Prince Koreaki (惟明親王; 1172–1221) later Imperial Prince Priest Shōen (聖円入道親王)

* Court Lady: Fujiwara Kimiko (藤原公子) or Sochi-no-Tsubone (帥局), Fujiwara no Kimishige’s daughter – former nanny of Takakura
** First daughter: Imperial Princess Isako (功子内親王; b. 1176) – Saigū of Ise

* Court Lady: Kogō-no-Tsubone (小督局; b. 1157), Fujiwara no Shigenori’s daughter
** Second daughter: Imperial Princess Hanshi/ Noriko (範子内親王; 1177–1210) later Empress Dowager Bōmon-in (坊門院)

== Events of Takakura&#x27;s life ==
Although Takakura was formally enthroned, the reality was that government affairs were controlled by his father and his father-in-law.

* 30 March 1168 (&quot;Nin&#x27;an 3, 19th day of the 2nd month&quot;): In the 3rd year of Rokujō&quot;-tennō&quot;″s reign (六条天皇3年), the emperor was deposed by his grandfather, and the succession (‘‘senso’’) was received by his cousin, the third son of the retired-Emperor Go-Shirakawa.
* 29 April 1168 (&quot;Nin&#x27;an 3, 20th day of the 3rd month&quot;): Emperor Takakura is said to have acceded to the throne (‘‘sokui’’), and he is proclaimed emperor.

Takakura had his own views on the role of Emperor. He is said to have written:
:&quot;The Emperor is a ship. His subjects are water. The water enables a ship to float well, but sometimes the vessel is capsized by it. His subjects can sustain an Emperor well, but sometimes they overthrow him.&quot;

Ex-Emperor Go-Shirakawa exercised the powers attendant the well-settled patterns of cloistered rule. Taira no Kiyomori, who was the father of the Empress, did whatever he pleased as &quot;de facto&quot; Regent.

* 6 March 1172 (&quot;Jōan 2, 10th day of the 2nd month&quot;): Taira Kiyomori&#x27;s daughter, Tokuko, becomes Takakura&#x27;s consort.
* 27 May 1177 (&quot;Jishō 1, 28th day of the 4th month&quot;): A great fire in the capital was spread by high winds; and the palace was reduced to cinders.

* 22 December 1178 (&quot;Jishō 2, 12th day of the 11th month&quot;): Takakura&#x27;s consort, Taira-no Tokuko, gave birth to a son. Kiyomori rejoiced; and all the officers of the court congratulated the parents. In the next month, this infant was declared heir to Emperor Takakura.
* 18 March 1180 (&quot;Jisho 4, 21st day of the 2nd month&quot;): Emperor Takakura abdicated.
* 18 May 1180 (&quot;Jisho 4, 22nd day of the 4th month&quot;): Emperor Antoku&#x27;s coronation ceremony.
* 26 June 1180 (&quot;Jisho 4, 2nd day of the 6th month&quot;): Former-emperor Go-Shirakawa-in, former-emperor Takakura-in and Emperor Antoku leave Kyoto for Fukuhara-kyō.
* 14 December 1180 (&quot;Jisho 4, 26th day of the 11th month&quot;): The capital is moved back to Kyoto from Fukuhara.
* 1180 (&quot;Jisho 4&quot;): A devastating whirlwind causes havoc in Heian-kyō, the capital.
* 30 January 1181 (&quot;Jisho 5, 14th day of the 1st month&quot;): Emperor Takakura died.

Soon after the birth of Emperor Takakura&#x27;s son, Prince Tokihito, he was pressured to abdicate. The one-year-old infant would become Emperor Antoku.

===&quot;Kugyō&quot;===
&quot;Kugyō&quot; (公卿) is a collective term for the most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Takakura&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:
* &quot;Sesshō&quot;, Matsuo Motofusa, 1144–1230.
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Konoe Motomichi, 1160–1233.
* &quot;Daijō-daijin&quot;, Fujiwara Tadamasa.
* &quot;Daijō-daijin&quot;, Fujiwara Moronaga, 1137–1192.
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;, Ōimikado Tsunemune, 1119–1189.
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;, Kujō Kanezane, 1149–1207.
* &quot;Nadaijin&quot;, Konoe Motomichi.
* &quot;Nadaijin&quot;, Minamoto Masamichi, died 1175.
* &quot;Nadaijin&quot;, Taira Shigemori, 1138–1179.
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;

==Eras of Takakura&#x27;s reign==
The years of Takakura&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;.
* &quot;Nin&#x27;an&quot; (1166–1169)
* &quot;Kaō&quot; (1169–1171)
* &quot;Jōan&quot; (1171–1175)
* &quot;Angen&quot; (1175–1177)
* &quot;Jishō&quot; (1177–1181)

==Cultural references==
Takakura is the &quot;Imperial Sovereign&quot; of the Japan-inspired land of Akatsurai in Book 6: &quot;The Lords of the Rising Sun&quot; in the Fabled Lands adventure gamebook series. He is portrayed as a young man with little real power, it being largely in the hands of his chancellor, &quot;Lord Kiyomori&quot;.

<doc id="229379" wikidata="Q485258" url="?curid=229379" title="Federative units of Brazil">
<text>The federative units of Brazil () are subnational entities with a certain degree of autonomy (self-government, self-regulation, and self-collection) and endowed with their own government and constitution, which together form the Federative Republic of Brazil. There are 26 states (&#x27;) and [[Federal District (Brazil)|one federal district]] (&#x27;). The states are generally based on historical, conventional borders which have developed over time. The states are divided into municipalities, while the Federal District assumes the competences of both a state and a municipality.

==Government==
The government of each state of Brazil is divided into executive, legislative and judiciary branches.

The state executive branch is headed by a state governor and includes a vice governor, both elected by the citizens of the state. The governor appoints several secretaries of state (each one in charge of a given portfolio) and the state attorney-general.

The state legislative branch is the legislative assembly, a unicameral body composed of deputies elected by the citizens of the state.

The judiciary in each of the states is composed of judges of law, who constitute the courts of first instance, and a Court of Justice, which is the court of second instance of the state and is composed of judges called &quot;desembargadores&quot;. Judges qualify through exams or are appointed.

The states are divided into municipalities, which have different competences and are considered autonomous from the states. Municipalities have a mayor, vice mayor and a chamber of aldermen, all elected by the citizens of the municipality, but do not have a separate judiciary.

The Federal District has the same executive, legislative and judiciary organization as a state, but it cannot be divided into municipalities, which is why its territory is composed of several administrative regions. These regions are directly managed by the government of the Federal District, which exercises constitutional and legal powers that are equivalent to those of the states, as well as those of the municipalities, thus simultaneously assuming all the obligations arising from them.

Fernando de Noronha is not a municipality, but a state district of Pernambuco (the only state district in the country). It is governed by an administrator-general, appointed by the governor of Pernambuco, and a council whose members are elected by the citizens of the district.

All states and the Federal District are represented in the national congress, each with three senators and between eight and 70 deputies, depending on their population. The citizens of all states and the Federal District vote for these national representatives and for president and vice president.

==History==

The present states of Brazil trace their history directly to the captaincies established by Portugal following the Treaty of Tordesillas which divided the World between Portugal and Spain.

The first administrative divisions of Brazil were the hereditary captaincies (&quot;capitanias hereditárias&quot;), stretches of land granted by the Portuguese Crown to noblemen or merchants with a charter to colonize the land. The first such captaincy was the island of São João, granted in 1504 to Fernão de Loronha. The continental land was divided into captaincies in 1534, generally following lines of latitude, although some followed meridians or diagonal lines. Each of the holders of these captaincies was referred to as a captain donatary (&quot;capitão donatário&quot;). The captaincies were to be inherited by the holders&#x27; descendants, but the Crown retained the power to reacquire them.

In 1549, the Portuguese Crown appointed Tomé de Sousa as the first governor-general of the vast Portuguese dominion in South America, known as the State of Brazil (&quot;Estado do Brasil&quot;). In 1621, the northern part of the dominion was detached, becoming a separate entity known as the State of Maranhão. However, captaincies continued existing under both states as regional administrations.

During the Iberian Union (1580–1640), which allowed Portuguese settlers to enter Spanish domains, the territory of Portuguese colonial domains in South America was more than doubled, with both states of Brazil and Maranhão greatly expanding westward. After the union ended, Portugal asserted its territorial claims, which Spain eventually accepted with the Treaty of Madrid in 1750. Several captaincies were created or merged during this period, in both the original and western domains, and some were returned to the Crown, becoming royal captaincies.

The government of the Marquis of Pombal (1750–1777) significantly centralized the administration of the Portuguese colonies. By 1759, all captaincies had been returned to the Crown, with captains becoming appointed rather than recognized by inheritance. Some captaincies were designated as captaincies-general, to which other captaincies were subordinated. In addition, the State of Grão-Pará and Rio Negro and the State of Maranhão and Piauí, which had been split from the State of Maranhão, were reincorporated into the State of Brazil in 1775, under a single governor-general. This centralization later helped to keep Brazil as a unified nation-state, avoiding fragmentation similar to that of the Spanish domains.

The captaincies became provinces in 1821, during the final years of the Kingdom of Brazil (united with Portugal), and maintained that designation after independence in 1822 under the Empire of Brazil. Most internal boundaries were kept unchanged from the end of the colonial period, generally following natural features such as rivers and mountain ridges. Some changes were made to suit domestic politics (transferring the Triângulo Mineiro from Goiás to Minas Gerais, transferring the south bank of the São Francisco River from Pernambuco to Minas Gerais and later to Bahia, separating the capital city of Rio de Janeiro as a Neutral Municipality outside any province, splitting Amazonas from Pará, and splitting Paraná from São Paulo), as well as international border adjustments resulting from diplomatic settlement of territorial disputes. The Cisplatine Province was annexed into Brazil in 1821, declared independence as Uruguay in 1825, and was recognized by the Treaty of Montevideo in 1828.

When Brazil became a republic in 1889, all provinces became states, and the Neutral Municipality became the Federal District. In 1903, Brazil acquired the territory of Acre from Bolivia with the Treaty of Petrópolis.

In 1942–1943, with the entrance of Brazil into World War II, the Vargas regime detached six strategic territories from the borders of the country to administer them directly: the archipelago of Fernando de Noronha (from Pernambuco), Amapá (from Pará), Rio Branco (from Amazonas), Guaporé (from Mato Grosso and Amazonas), Ponta Porã (from Mato Grosso) and Iguaçu (from Paraná and Santa Catarina). Shortly after the war, the Brazilian constitution of 1946 returned Ponta Porã and Iguaçu to their original states. Guaporé was renamed Rondônia in 1956, and Rio Branco was renamed Roraima in 1962, while remaining territories along with Amapá and Fernando de Noronha. Acre became a state in 1962.

In 1960, the rectangular-shaped Distrito Federal was carved out of Goiás to contain the new capital, Brasília. The previous federal district became the state of Guanabara, but in 1975 it was reincorporated into its original state of Rio de Janeiro, becoming its capital as the city of Rio de Janeiro.

In 1977, the southern part of Mato Grosso became the state of Mato Grosso do Sul. In 1981, Rondônia became a state. The Brazilian constitution of 1988 created the state of Tocantins from the northern portion of Goiás, established Amapá and Roraima as states, and returned the archipelago of Fernando de Noronha to Pernambuco. The constitution thus ended all remaining territories, although it maintained the possibility of creating others in the future.

=== Proposed federative states ===
==== Proposed division of Pará ====

On 11 December 2011, a consultative referendum was held in the state of Pará about creating two new states from parts of it (Tapajós and Carajás, with the rest of the state remaining as Pará). Both proposals were rejected by about 66% of statewide voters, but reflecting a strong geographic split with over 90% approval by voters in the proposed breakaway regions and over 90% disapproval by those in the rest of the state.

<doc id="229386" wikidata="Q449540" url="?curid=229386" title="Emperor Ichijō">
<text>was the 66th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.

Ichijō&#x27;s reign spanned the years from 986 to 1011.

==Biography==
Before he ascended to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (&quot;imina&quot;) was Yasuhito&quot;-shinnō&quot; (懐仁).
Kanehito&quot;-shinnō&quot; was the first son of Emperor En&#x27;yū and Fujiwara no Senshi, a daughter of Fujiwara no Kaneie. Since there are no documented siblings, it is supposed that he was an only child.

Ichijō had five Empresses or Imperial consorts and five Imperial sons and daughters.

==Events of Ichijō&#x27;s life==
His reign coincided with the culmination of Heian period culture and the apex of the power of the Fujiwara clan. He ascended to the throne after a period of political instability that began within the Fujiwara clan after they successfully eliminated the Minamoto clan as a political rival. The internal power struggle that ensued within the Fujiwara saw the untimely ends of three emperors. Ichijō had been appointed crown prince under Emperor Kazan in 984. Two years later, after Emperor Kazan abdicated in 986, Ichijō ascended to the throne at the age of six. The young Emperor Ichijō was under the influence of his uncle Fujiwara no Michinaga from the start of his reign, though Michinaga&#x27;s true ascent to political dominance did not begin until 995 after the deaths of his older brothers and the exile of his political rival and nephew, Korechika.

These events took place during the Kanna era (see Japanese era name &quot;nengō&quot; 年号), after Emperor Kazan abdicated. The succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by a cousin, the son of his father&#x27;s younger brother.

* August 1, 986 (&quot;Kanna 2, 23rd day of the 6th month&quot;): Emperor Ichijō is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).

A son of Emperor Reizei, who was older than Ichijō, was appointed crown prince. Kaneie became the regent (&quot;Sesshō&quot;) and effectively ruled the state. After Kaneie died in 990, his first son and Ichijō&#x27;s uncle Fujiwara no Michitaka was appointed regent.

* March 1, 991 (&quot;Shōryaku 2, 12th day of the 2nd month&quot;): The former-Emperor En&#x27;yū died at the age of 33.
* 1008 (&quot;Kankō 5, 8th day of the 2nd month&quot;): Kazan died at the age of 41.
* July 16, 1011 (&quot;Kankō 8, 13th day of the 6th month&quot;): In the 25th year of Emperor Ichijō&#x27;s reign (一条天皇二十五年), the emperor abdicated; and the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by his cousin. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Sanjō is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).
* July 19, 1011 (&quot;Kankō 8, 16th day of the 6th month&quot;): Emperor Ichijō takes tonsure as a Buddhist monk.
* July 25, 1011 (&quot;Kankō 8, 22nd day of the 6th month&quot;): Emperor Ichijō died.

The mother of the emperor had a large influence over the appointment of officials, &quot;the emperor&#x27;s officials controls matters of the state, as the imperial mother makes affairs of the court solely her own.&quot;

Ichijō had two empress consorts. First was Teishi (or Fujiwara no Sadako), a daughter of Fujiwara no Michitaka. Second was Shōshi (or Akiko), a daughter of Fujiwara no Michinaga, a younger brother of Michitaka. Most people thought it impossible to have two empress consorts, but Michinaga claimed that the empress held two separate titles, &quot;Chūgū&quot; and &quot;Kōgō&quot;, which were different in principle and could therefore given to two different women.

The courts of both empresses were known as centers of culture. Sei Shōnagon, author of &quot;The Pillow Book&quot;, was a lady in waiting to Teishi. Murasaki Shikibu was a lady in waiting to Shoshi. There were other famous poets in the courts of the empresses.

Ichijō loved literature and music. For this reason, high ranked courtiers felt the necessity for their daughter to hold cultural salons with many skillful lady poets. Particularly he was fond of the flute. Ichijō was known for his temperate character and was beloved by his subjects.

During Ichijō&#x27;s reign, Imperial visits were first made to the following four shrines: Kasuga, Ōharano, Matsunoo, and Kitano; and in the years which followed, Emperors traditionally made yearly Imperial visits to these shrines and to three others: Kamo, Iwashimizu and Hirano.

The actual site of Ichijō&#x27;s grave is known. This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) at Kyoto.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Ichijō&#x27;s mausoleum. It is formally named &quot;En&#x27;yū-ji no kita no misasagi&quot;.

Ichijō is buried amongst the &quot;Seven Imperial Tombs&quot; at Ryōan-ji Temple in Kyoto. The mound which commemorates the Emperor Ichijō is today named &quot;Kinugasa-yama.&quot; The emperor&#x27;s burial place would have been quite humble in the period after Ichijo died.

These tombs reached their present state as a result of the 19th century restoration of imperial sepulchers (&quot;misasagi&quot;) which were ordered by Emperor Meiji.

===Kugyō===
 is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career.

During Kazan&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:
* Sesshō, Fujiwara no Kaneie (藤原兼家), 929–990.
* Sesshō, Fujiwara no Michitaka (藤原道隆), 953–995.

* Daijō-daijin, Fujiwara no Yoritada (藤原頼忠), 924–989.
* Daijō-daijin, Fujiwara no Tamemitsu(藤原為光), 942–992.
* Sadaijin, Fujiwara no Michinaga (藤原道長), 966–1027.
* Udaijin, Fujiwara no Michikane (藤原道兼).
* Naidaijin, Fujiwara no Michitaka.
* Naidaijin, Fujiwara no Korechika (藤原伊周), 973–1010.
* Naidaijin, Kan&#x27;in Kinsue (藤原公季), 956–1029.
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;

<text>Corineus, in medieval British legend, was a prodigious warrior, a fighter of giants, and the eponymous founder of Cornwall.

== &quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot; ==
In Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s pseudo-history &quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot; (1136), Corineus led the descendants of the Trojans who fled with Antenor after the Trojan War and settled on the coasts of the Tyrrhenian Sea. He is described as &quot;a modest man in matters of council, and of great courage and boldness&quot;, his giant-fighting prowess is also described, and later reinforced by boasts of having killed &quot;heaps&quot; of Tyrrhenian giants.

After Brutus, a descendant of the Trojan prince Aeneas, had been exiled from Italy and liberated the enslaved Trojans in Greece, he encountered Corineus and his people, who joined him in his travels. In Gaul, Corineus provoked a war with Goffarius Pictus, king of Aquitania, by hunting in his forests without permission; in the ensuing battle, Corineus single-handedly killed thousands with a battle-axe. After defeating Goffarius, the Trojans crossed to the island of Albion, which Brutus renamed Britain after himself. Corineus settled in Cornwall, which was then inhabited by giants. Brutus and his army killed most of them, but their leader, Goemagog, was kept alive for a wrestling match with Corineus. During the fight, Goemagog broke three of Corineus&#x27; ribs; enraged, he picked Goemagog up, ran to the coast, and threw the giant from a high rock into the sea, with the craggy rocks below tearing him to pieces.

Corineus was the first of the legendary rulers of Cornwall, which was named after him. After Brutus died the rest of Britain was divided between Brutus&#x27; three sons, Locrinus (Loegria), Kamber (Cambria) and Albanactus (Alba). Locrinus agreed to marry Corineus&#x27;s daughter Gwendolen, but fell in love instead with Estrildis, a captured German princess. Corineus threatened war in response to this affront, and to pacify him Locrinus married Gwendolen, but kept Estrildis as his secret mistress. After Corineus died Locrinus divorced Gwendolen and married Estrildis, and Gwendolen responded by raising an army in Cornwall and making war against her ex-husband. Locrinus was killed in battle, and Gwendolen threw Estrildis and her daughter, Sabren, into the River Severn.

== &quot;Aeneid&quot; and other sources ==
Geoffrey probably took the name from the character Corynaeus in the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, a Trojan follower of Aeneas. Archbishop Michael Joseph Curley suggests that this name was chosen by Geoffrey due to its similarity to the word Cornwall, and his &quot;naive (or ironic) fondness for eponymy as a form of historical research&quot;.

Curley also suggests there is a parallel between Corineus and Hercules in Lucan&#x27;s &quot;Pharsalia&quot;, who defeated the giant Antaeus in a wrestling match by lifting him from the earth, the source of his strength.

Geoffrey&#x27;s main source for the &quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot; was the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;. It does not mention Corineus, but two parts of the &quot;Historia&quot; were used as sources for Corineus&#x27; location on &quot;the shores&quot; of the Tyrrhenian Sea, where he is found by Brutus. The first is the &quot;Historia&quot;″s account of Brutus&#x27; banishment: unlike the &quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot;, where Brutus immediately goes to Greece, Brutus instead first travels to &quot;the islands of the Tyrrhenian Sea&quot;, where, instead of Corineus, he finds Greek colonists living, who expel him due to Aeneas&#x27; killing of Turnus. The second is a variant of the story of Goídel Glas, in which the hero travels from Egypt to Iberia via a sequence of named places – Africa, then Aras Philaenorum, Lacus Salinarum, between Rusicada and the Mountains of Azaria, along the River Malua through Mauretania to the Pillars of Hercules, then the Tyrrhenian Sea – Geoffrey uses precisely the same sequence of locations for Brutus&#x27; journey after getting his prophecy from Diana, and even explains the backtracking from the Pillars of Hercules to the Tyrrhenian Sea by saying Brutus was fleeing from Sirens; it is at this point in the story of the &quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot; that Brutus finds Corineus on &quot;the shores&quot; of the Tyrrhenian Sea.

== Gogmagog&#x27;s Leap ==

The fight between Corineus and Gogmagog is described in the &quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot; as ending at a place called or , which Geoffrey says still retained the name. John Milton&#x27;s &quot;The History of Britain&quot; (1670) referred to the place as &quot;Langoëmagog&quot;, , which is sometimes changed to &quot;Langoënagog&quot; or &quot;Langnagog&quot;. The Middle English prose &quot;Brut&quot; () places their fight &quot;at Totttenes&quot; (Totnes, Devon), where Corineus and Brutus had landed in the &quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot;, while &quot;Holinshed&#x27;s Chronicles&quot; (1577) placed the &quot;leape of Gogmagog&quot; at Dover.

Researcher Peter Bartrum suggests that the story may have been based on hill figures of two giants fighting carved into the grass at Plymouth Hoe. The first known mention of these figures was in 1495, and contemporary records exist of them being periodically re-cut and cleaned, referring to them as Gogmagog. Antiquary Richard Carew believed that the fight may have begun near Totnes, but ended at Plymouth Hoe, with the figures depicting Corineus and Gogmagog; he described them in his &quot;Survey of Cornwall&quot; (1602): &quot;upon the Hawe at Plymmouth, there is cut out in the ground, the pourtrayture of two men, the one bigger, the other lesser, with Clubbes in their hands, (whom they terme Gog-Magog) and (as I have learned) it is renewed by order of the Townesmen, when cause requireth, which should inferre the same to bee a monument of some moment.&quot; Later historians such as John Allen Giles followed this suggestion as the most likely location.

The figures were destroyed by the construction of the Royal Citadel in 1665. In 2021, artist Charles Newington painted Corineus and Gogmagog on a grassy bank below the Citadel, inspired by the earlier figures and the story of Corineus and Gogmagog.

== Later traditions ==
The tale is preserved in the works of later writers, including Michael Drayton and John Milton.

John of Hauville&#x27;s &quot;Architrenius&quot; () was dedicated to Archbishop Walter de Coutances, who claimed descent from Corineus. The &quot;Architrenius&quot; changes Corineus into a greater figure than Brutus (who it says accompanied Corineus as his Achates), and describes him as &quot;the world-conqueror&quot;, a second Hercules, who fought in the Trojan War: &quot;the terror of Achilles and the Atrides, the cutter-down of giants and batterer of monsters&quot;. While &quot;sojourning on the Tyrrhenian shores, Corineus destroyed the limbs of giants with a bone-crushing embrace. He was himself a giant, not in body but in his indomitable heroism. Though confined to medium stature, and with limbs not disproportionately thick, he seemed to assume a Titanic stature, massive and terrifying.&quot; After massacring the Aquitanians he sets sail for Britain &quot;favoured by gods and winds, and guided by Diana to his destined corner of the world, he enters safe harbour on the Cornish coast at Totnes&quot;; Cornwall is described as &quot;flowing with milk and honey. Hence the place, at first named Corineia, over the course of time assumed the corrupted name of Cornubia.&quot; Arthur is later described as a descendant of Corineus.

The 13th century Prose &quot;Merlin&quot; calls the character Corneus, a descendant of giants, who was &quot;a mervilouse knyght, and was moche and stronge&quot;. In this version, he and Brutus were two barons who fled the destruction of Troy, but while Brutus travelled to Britain, Corneus travelled to Brittany instead, where he built towns and castles, and gave his name to Cornouaille. Corneus&#x27; descendants were the giants who troubled the Britons, and they survived until the time of King Arthur.

&quot;Locrine&quot; (1595), a play attributed to Shakespeare, has Corineius as a major character, one of two brothers of Brutus, along with Assarachus, and is father to Gwendoline and Thrasimachus. Corineius is described as being found by Brutus at &quot;the fields of Lestrigon&quot;, and subsequently having fought Gathelus, the brother of Goffarius of Gaul. He lives more than eighty-seven years, dying from a lingering wound he had received in battle with Humber the Hun, and returns as a ghost to witness Locrine&#x27;s downfall.

Corineus is also a major character in Henry Chettle and John Day&#x27;s lost play &quot;The Conquest of Brute with the First Finding of the Bath&quot; which was performed by the Lord Admiral&#x27;s Men at the Rose in December 1598.

Oliver Mathews&#x27; &quot;Towne of Sallop&quot; (1616) refers to &quot;Troenius, Duke of Cornwall, who was afterward called Coreneus&quot;. Richard Williams Morgan expanded on this in &quot;The British Kymry&quot; (1857), calling him Troenius, and saying that he was assigned the &quot;Western Keryn or promotory&quot; of Britain (from Torbay to Land&#x27;s End) by Brutus, and that &quot;from the Keryn, Troenius changed his name into Keryn or Corineus&quot;. Morgan also attempted to explain Brutus&#x27; backtracking from the Pillars of Hercules to the Tyrrhenian Sea, by saying that he passed through the Pillars of Hercules, and came across Troenius on the south shore of Spain, where he was ruling four Trojan colonies, claiming that the Atlantic was then called the Tyrrhenian Ocean. He described Troenius as sovereign duke of Cornwall, with the same prerogatives over his land as the kings of Loegria, Cambria and Albany had over theirs, and said that Troenius was consigned the guardianship of his daughter Gwendolen&#x27;s son Maddan.

As to Corineus&#x27;s stature, he is represented as being the largest of Brutus&#x27;s crew in the Middle English prose &quot;Brut&quot;. &quot;Holinshed&#x27;s Chronicles&quot; comment that Corineus was not a giant, but in the 1587 edition mistakenly claims the &quot;Architrenius&quot; describes Corineus as a man 12 cubits (18 feet) tall.

A local folk tradition says that Corineus founded the city of Quimper, the ancient capital of Cornouaille in France.

<text>James Bond Stockdale (December 23, 1923 – July 5, 2005) was a United States Navy vice admiral and aviator who was awarded the Medal of Honor in the Vietnam War, during which he was a prisoner of war for over seven years.

Stockdale was the most senior naval officer held captive in Hanoi, North Vietnam. He led aerial attacks from the carrier during the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident. On his next deployment, while commander of Carrier Air Wing Sixteen aboard the carrier , his A-4 Skyhawk jet was shot down in North Vietnam on September 9, 1965. He served as president of the Naval War College from October 1977 until he retired from the navy in 1979. As vice admiral, James Bond Stockdale was the president of The Citadel from 1979 to 1980.

Stockdale was a candidate for vice president of the United States in the 1992 presidential election, on Ross Perot&#x27;s independent ticket.

==Early life and education==
Stockdale was born in Abingdon, Illinois, on December 23, 1923, the son of Vernon Beard Stockdale (1888–1964) and Mabel Edith Stockdale (; 1889–1967). Following a brief period at Monmouth College, he entered the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, in June 1943.

==Naval career==
On June 5, 1946, he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from the U.S. Naval Academy with the Class of 1947 due to the reduced schedule still in effect from World War II. Academically, he ranked 130th among 821 graduates in his class. His first assignment was assistant gunnery officer aboard the destroyer minesweeper from June to October 1946. He next served aboard the from October 1946 to February 1947, the from February 1947 to July 1948, and the from July 1948 to June 1949.

Stockdale was accepted for flight training in June 1949 and reported to Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida. He was designated a Naval Aviator at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi in Texas, in September 1950. He was next assigned for additional training at Naval Air Station Norfolk in Virginia from October 1950 to January 1951. In January 1954, he was accepted into the United States Naval Test Pilot School at the Naval Air Station Patuxent River base in Southern Maryland, and he completed his training in July 1954. There he tutored the U.S. Marine Corps aviator John Glenn in mathematics and physics. He was a test pilot until January 1957.

In 1959, the U.S. Navy sent Stockdale to Stanford University, where he earned a Master of Arts degree in international relations in 1962. Stockdale preferred the life of a fighter pilot over academia, but he later credited Stoic philosophy with helping him cope as a prisoner of war.

===Vietnam War===
====Gulf of Tonkin Incident====
On August 2, 1964, while on a DESOTO patrol in the Tonkin Gulf, the destroyer engaged three North Vietnamese Navy P-4 torpedo boats from the 135th Torpedo Squadron. After fighting a running gun and torpedo battle, in which &quot;Maddox&quot; fired over 280 shells, and the torpedo boats expended their 6 torpedoes (all misses) and hundreds of rounds of 14.5mm machine gun fire; the combatants broke contact. As the torpedo boats turned for their North Vietnamese coastline, four F-8 Crusader fighter aircraft from arrived, and immediately attacked the retreating torpedo boats.

Stockdale (commander VF-51 (Fighter Squadron 51)), with Lieutenant (Junior Grade) Richard Hastings attacked torpedo boats &quot;T-333&quot; and &quot;T-336&quot;, while Commander R. F. Mohrhardt and Lieutenant Commander C. E. Southwick attacked torpedo boat &quot;T-339&quot;. The four F-8 pilots reported scoring no hits with their Zuni rockets, but reported hits on all three torpedo boats with their 20 mm cannon.

Two nights later, on August 4, 1964, Stockdale was overhead during the second reported attack in the Tonkin Gulf. Unlike the first event, which was an actual sea battle, no Vietnamese forces were believed to have been involved in the second engagement. In the early 1990s, he recounted: &quot;[I] had the best seat in the house to watch that event, and our destroyers were just shooting at phantom targets—there were no PT boats there. ... There was nothing there but black water and American fire power.&quot;

The next morning, on August 5, 1964, President Johnson ordered bombing raids on North Vietnamese military targets which he announced were retaliation for the alleged incident of August 4. When Stockdale was awakened in the early morning and was told he was to lead these attacks he responded: &quot;Retaliation for what?&quot; Later, while a prisoner of war, he was concerned that he would be forced to reveal this secret about the Vietnam War.

====Prisoner of war====
On September 9, 1965, while flying as the Carrier Air Wing Sixteen Commander from on a mission over North Vietnam, Stockdale ejected from his Douglas A-4 Skyhawk, which had been struck by enemy fire and completely disabled. He parachuted into a small village, where he was severely beaten and taken prisoner.

Stockdale was held as a prisoner of war in the Hỏa Lò Prison (the infamous &quot;Hanoi Hilton&quot;) for the next years. As the senior naval officer, he was one of the primary organizers of prisoner resistance. Tortured routinely and denied medical attention for the severely damaged leg he suffered during capture, Stockdale created and enforced a code of conduct for all prisoners, which governed torture, secret communications, and behavior. In the summer of 1969, he was locked in leg irons in a bath stall and routinely tortured and beaten. When told by his captors that he was to be paraded in public, Stockdale slit his scalp with a razor to purposely disfigure himself so that his captors could not use him as propaganda. When they covered his head with a hat, he beat himself with a stool until his face was swollen beyond recognition. When Stockdale was discovered with information that could implicate his friends&#x27; so-called &quot;black activities&quot;, he slit his wrists so they could not torture him into confession. During the course of his captivity, due to torture, his leg was broken twice.

Early in Stockdale&#x27;s captivity, his wife, Sybil Stockdale, organized The League of American Families of POWs and MIAs, with other wives of servicemen who were in similar circumstances. By 1968, she and her organization, which called for the president and the U.S. Congress to publicly acknowledge the mistreatment of the POWs (something that had never been done despite evidence of gross mistreatment), gained the attention of the American press. Sybil Stockdale personally made these demands known at the Paris Peace Talks.

Stockdale was one of eleven U.S. military prisoners known as the &quot;Alcatraz Gang&quot;: George Thomas Coker, USN; George G. McKnight, USAF; Jeremiah Denton, USN (who had graduated with Stockdale from the Naval Academy); Harry Jenkins, USN; Sam Johnson, USAF; James Mulligan, USN; Howard Rutledge, USN; Robert Shumaker, USN (originator of the name &quot;Hanoi Hilton&quot;); Ronald Storz, USAF (died in captivity); and Nels Tanner, USN. Because they had been resistance leaders they were separated from other captives and placed in solitary confinement in &quot;Alcatraz&quot;, a special facility in a courtyard behind the North Vietnamese Ministry of National Defense, located about one mile away from Hỏa Lò Prison. In Alcatraz, each of the prisoners was kept in an individual windowless and concrete cell measuring with a light bulb kept on around the clock, and locked in leg irons each night. Of the eleven, Storz died in captivity there in 1970.

====The Stockdale Paradox====
James C. Collins related a conversation he had with James Stockdale regarding his coping strategy during his period in the Vietnamese POW camp. When Collins asked which prisoners didn&#x27;t make it out of Vietnam, Stockdale replied:

Collins called this the Stockdale Paradox.

===Return to the United States===
Stockdale was released as a prisoner of war on February 12, 1973, during Operation Homecoming.

On March 4, 1976, Stockdale received the Medal of Honor. Stockdale filed charges against two other officers (Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel Edison W. Miller and Navy Captain Walter E. &quot;Gene&quot; Wilber) who, he felt, had given aid and comfort to the enemy. However, the Department of the Navy under the leadership of then-Secretary of the Navy John Warner took no action and retired these men &quot;in the best interests of the Navy.&quot; Both Miller and Wilber received letters of censure.

Debilitated by his captivity and mistreatment, Stockdale could not stand upright and could barely walk upon his return to the United States, which prevented his return to active flying status. In deference to his previous service, the navy kept him on active duty, steadily promoting him over the next few years before he retired as a vice admiral on September 1, 1979. He completed his career by serving as the president of the Naval War College at Newport, Rhode Island, from October 13, 1977, until August 22, 1979.

===Civilian academic work and writings===

After his retirement in 1979, he became the president of The Citadel. His tenure there was short and stormy as he found himself at odds with the college&#x27;s board as well as most of its administration, by proposing radical changes to the college&#x27;s military system and other facets of the college. He left The Citadel to become a fellow of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University in 1981. During his twelve-year tenure at the Hoover Institution, Stockdale wrote and lectured extensively. His primary focus was ancient Stoicism and the Roman slave-turned-philosopher Epictetus, whose lessons captured in &quot;The Enchiridion&quot; Stockdale credited with providing him strength during his ordeals as a prisoner in the Hanoi Hilton. Between 1981 and 1988 Stockdale also served as chair of the White House Fellows under the Reagan administration.

In 1984, Stockdale and his wife Sybil co-authored &quot;In Love and War: the Story of a Family&#x27;s Ordeal and Sacrifice During the Vietnam War&quot;, which was published by Harper and Row. It recounts Stockdale&#x27;s experiences while in Vietnam; additionally, in alternating chapters, it also tells the story of Sybil Stockdale&#x27;s early involvement in the League of American Families of POWs and MIAs, which she helped to found, and served as its first chairperson. Their story was later made into an NBC television movie under the name &quot;In Love and War&quot;, starring James Woods and Jane Alexander.

Stockdale was a member of the board of directors of the Rockford Institute, and he was a frequent contributor to &quot;Chronicles: A magazine of American Culture&quot;.

==Vice presidential candidacy==
Stockdale became acquainted with businessman and presidential candidate Ross Perot through his wife&#x27;s work in establishing an organization to represent the families of Vietnam POWs. On March 30, 1992, Perot announced that he had asked Stockdale to be the provisional vice presidential candidate on his 1992 independent ticket. Perot intended to replace Stockdale with another candidate, but did not do so before dropping out of the race in July 1992.

Perot re-entered the race in the fall of 1992, with Stockdale still in place as vice presidential candidate. Stockdale was not informed that he would be participating in the October 13 vice presidential debate held in Atlanta, Georgia, until a week before the event. He had no formal preparation for the debate, unlike his opponents Al Gore and Dan Quayle, and did not discuss any political issues with Perot beforehand.

Stockdale opened the debate by saying, &quot;Who am I? Why am I here?&quot;, as a response to the request for an opening statement from debate moderator, Hal Bruno, the political director of ABC News. At first the rhetorical questions drew applause from the audience. However, his unfocused manner through the rest of the debate (including asking the moderator to repeat one question because he did not have his hearing aid turned on) made him appear confused and disoriented. A humorous caricature of the debate on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; later that week, with Phil Hartman as Stockdale, cemented a public perception of Stockdale as slow-witted. He was also often parodied for his repeated use of the term &quot;gridlock&quot; to describe slow governmental policy.

As his introduction to the large segment of American voters who had not previously heard of him, the debate was disastrous for Stockdale. He was portrayed in the media as elderly and confused, and his reputation never recovered. In a 1999 interview with Jim Lehrer, Stockdale explained that the statements were intended to introduce himself and his personal history to the television audience:

It was terribly frustrating because I remember I started with, &quot;Who am I? Why am I here?&quot; and I never got back to that because there was never an opportunity for me to explain my life to people. It was so different from Quayle and Gore. The four years in solitary confinement in Vietnam, seven-and-a-half years in prisons, drop the first bomb that started the...American bombing raid in the North Vietnam. We blew the oil storage tanks of them off the map. And I never—I couldn&#x27;t approach—I don&#x27;t say it just to brag, but, I mean, my sensitivities are completely different.
In a 1994 HBO comedy special, Dennis Miller gave an impassioned defense of Stockdale&#x27;s debate performance:

Now I know (Stockdale&#x27;s name has) become a buzzword in this culture for doddering old man, but let&#x27;s look at the record, folks. The guy was the first guy in and the last guy out of Vietnam, a war that many Americans, including your new President, chose not to dirty their hands with. He had to turn his hearing aid on at that debate because those fucking animals knocked his eardrums out when he wouldn&#x27;t spill his guts. He teaches philosophy at Stanford University, he&#x27;s a brilliant, sensitive, courageous man. And yet he committed the one unpardonable sin in our culture: he was bad on television.
Perot and Stockdale received 19 percent of the vote in the 1992 presidential election, one of the best showings by an independent ticket in U.S. electoral history, although they did not carry any states.

==Later life and death==

Stockdale retired to Coronado, California, as he slowly succumbed to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He died from the illness on July 5, 2005. He was 81. Stockdale&#x27;s funeral service was held at the Naval Academy Chapel and he was buried at the United States Naval Academy Cemetery.

==Legacy==
The Vice Admiral James Bond Stockdale Award for Inspirational Leadership is a United States Navy award established in 1980 by United States Secretary of the Navy Edward Hidalgo to honor the inspirational leadership of Stockdale. The award was first made in 1981.

The U.S. Navy has named a number of structures after Stockdale, including the Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer , christened on May 10, 2008. At the Naval Air Station North Island in Coronado, California, the main gate (inaugurated on August 30, 2007) and the headquarters building for the Pacific Fleet&#x27;s Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) school were both named in his honor. In July 2008, a statue of him was erected in front of Luce Hall at the U.S. Naval Academy; the hall which houses the Vice Admiral James B. Stockdale Center for Ethical Leadership.

In 1976, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

Stockdale Center, the student center at Monmouth College in Monmouth, Illinois, which he attended prior to transferring to the Naval Academy, was dedicated in his honor in 1989.

He was enshrined in the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 2002.

The Admiral James &amp; Sybil Stockdale Arena at South Kent School was named after Stockdale and his wife in April 2014.

In October 2014, Airbase Arizona of the Commemorative Air Force placed on display a restored Grumman AF-2S Guardian (BuNo 126731) flown by vice admiral Stockdale early in his navy career with his name on the canopy rail and all markings as they were when he flew the aircraft in the 1950s.

Stockdale&#x27;s naval experiences and his leadership decisions while senior naval officer in prison in North Vietnam are an integral part of every midshipman&#x27;s educational experience at Annapolis.

A luxury suite at the Loews Annapolis Hotel, where Perot announced his candidacy, was named in Stockdale&#x27;s honor.

The Abingdon-Avon High School Auditorium in Abingdon, Illinois, has been named &quot;Stockdale Auditorium&quot; in his honor.

<text>Paraná () is one of the 26 states of Brazil, in the south of the country. It is bordered in the north by São Paulo state, in the east by the Atlantic Ocean, in the south by Santa Catarina state and the province of Misiones, Argentina, and in the west by Mato Grosso do Sul and Paraguay, with the Paraná River as its western boundary. It is subdivided into 399 municipalities, and its capital is the city of Curitiba. Other major cities are Londrina, Maringá, Ponta Grossa, Cascavel, São José dos Pinhais and Foz do Iguaçu. The state is home to 5.4% of the Brazilian population and generates 6.2% of the Brazilian GDP.

Crossed by the Tropic of Capricorn, Paraná has what is left of the araucaria forest, one of the most important subtropical forests in the world. At the border with Argentina is the National Park of Iguaçu, considered by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. from there, at the border with Paraguay, the largest dam in the world was built, the Hidroelétrica de Itaipu (Itaipu Hydroelectric Dam). The crime rate is considered low by Brazilian standards and the state is one of the most developed ones in the nation, ranking 4th in gross domestic product, only behind the states of Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Minas Gerais.

==History==

Before the discovery of the region by European explorers, indigenous populations inhabited the region for thousands of years. This included the Carijó in the lands closer to the sea, from the Tupi group, and the Caingangues in the interior, who belonged to the Jê group.

Colonisation of the state by settlers started in the 16th century, but was mainly confined to the coasts. Being a region mostly abandoned by the Portuguese, the region was explored by other European countries, who searched primarily for Pau brasil. The most noteworthy presence was that of the Spanish, which brought with them jesuits. Soon, Jesuit reductions were opened in the western and south-western parts of the state, whose territory largely belonged to the Spanish crown. In 1554, Domingo Martínez de Irala founded the town of Ontiveros, one league away from the Guaíra Falls.

In the 1940s, the northern part of the state was settled as a result of the expansion of the São Paulo coffee industry. The south-eastern part of the state was settled as a result of migration from Rio Grande do Sul.

==Geography==
Paraná is bounded on the north by São Paulo state, on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, on the south by Santa Catarina state and the Misiones Province of Argentina, and on the west by Mato Grosso do Sul and the republic of Paraguay, with the Paraná River as its western boundary line.

The state can be separated into five main topographic areas, from east to west: a coastal zone, the mountains of Serra do Mar, and then three plateaus, each lower than the other, until the Paraná River is reached.

=== Climate ===


According to the Köppen climate classification, the north and west of the state, and the east coast, is of the &quot;Cfa&quot; climate type, with the remainder being &quot;Cfb&quot;. An alternative analysis using the ECMWF model indicates that the &quot;Aw&quot; and &quot;Cwa&quot; Köppen types appear in the north. The northern part of the state is the convergence point between the Tropical Atlantic and Equatorial Continental air masses.

==== Temperature and precipitation ====
The annual mean air temperature ranges between 15 and 24°, with the highest temperatures found in the northwest and the lowest around Palmas, which is considered the coldest city of Paraná by the meteorological body Simepar. In the coastal plain minimum average temperatures range between .

Precipitation is less than a year in the north of the state, rising to above in the southwest and southeast of the state.

==== Climate subtypes ====
The &quot;Cfa&quot; climate, subtropical with good distribution of annual rainfall and hot summers, occurs in the coastal plain and western parts of the state. Average temperature is , with rainfall of per year.

The &quot;Cfb&quot; climate, warm temperate with good distribution of annual rainfall and mild summers, occurs at higher elevation. The average annual temperatures are and rainfall of per year.

== Demographics ==
Parana is the sixth most populous state in Brazil. Its level of urbanization is 83.5%.
===Ethnic groups===


The 2022 census survey gave the following breakdown by race for the state: 7,389,932 White (64.6%), 3,440,037 Mixed (30.1%), 485,781 Black (4.2%), 100,244 Asian (0.9%), and 28,000 Amerindian (0.2%).

Parana&#x27;s white population is primarily descendant of Portuguese, Italian, Polish and Ukrainian immigrants, but many German families also settled in the state. A variation of German known as Paraná-Wolga-Deutsch originated in the area.

Initially settled by the Guarani and Kaingang Amerindians, until the 17th century, virtually no European presence existed in Paraná. The number of settlers grew around 1750 and the population was composed of Amerindians, Portuguese, and some Spaniards. African slaves from Angola and Mozambique were also present, but in fewer numbers than in other Brazilian areas, because Paraná was an unexplored region that did not need much slave manpower. As part of the province of São Paulo, immigration grew in the mid-19th century, mostly composed of Italian, German, Polish, Ukrainian, and Japanese peoples. While large numbers of Poles and Ukrainians are present in Paraná, their presence in the rest of Brazil is relatively small, especially Ukrainians. In the early 20th century, two waves of migration to Paraná occurred: one coming from the north, mostly of Portuguese, but also of African and Amerindian origin, and another from southern Brazil to the southwest and west, mostly of Portuguese, Italian, and German origins.

==Economy==


In 2013, the Paraná had the fifth largest GDP of Brazil, representing 5.90% of the Brazilian GDP in 2005, against 6.4% in 2003.

About 15% of Paraná&#x27;s GDP comes from agriculture. Another 40% comes from industry and the remaining 45% comes from the tertiary sector. As for its exports, in 2012 the main products exported were soybeans (18.73%), Meat Poultry (10.50%), sugar in Natura (8.09%), Soybean Meal (8.00%) and corn (6.36%). The state&#x27;s largest company is the government-owned Copel, which supplies electricity, natural gas and other utilities to Paraná and some surrounding areas and in 1997 was among the first Brazilian companies to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (ELP).

The main economic activities are agriculture, industry (agribusiness, automotive, and paper) and plant extraction (wood and yerba mate).
Despite the good social indicators and high standard of living, unemployment is still a problem and the state is one of the most difficult for foreigners trying to find jobs.

In agriculture, the state stands out in the production of soybeans, maize, wheat, sugarcane, cassava, beans, tomato, orange and yerba mate, in addition to also producing coffee, oat, barley, peach, tangerine and strawberry.

In 2020, the South Region produced 32% of the national total of cereals, vegetables and oilseeds. There were 77.2 million tons, second place in Brazil, losing only to the Midwest. Paraná (14.9%) was the 2nd largest producer in the country.

In soy, Paraná is the 2nd largest producer in the country, with about 16% of national production. It produced 19.8 million tons in 2020. In 2017, it was also 2nd largest producer of maize (corn). Brazil is the biggest producer of soy and the 2nd biggest producer of corn in the world.

Regarding sugarcane, Paraná was, in 2017, the fifth largest producer of cane, third of sugar and fifth of alcohol in the country. It harvested about 46 million tons of cane this year. The state&#x27;s sugar and alcohol sector has 25 plants and employs around 55,000 people. The regions of Umuarama, Paranavaí, Maringá and Jacarezinho concentrate production. Brazil is the largest world producer, with 672.8 million tons harvested in 2018.

In cassava production, Brazil produced a total of 17.6 million tons in 2018. Paraná was the 2nd largest producer in the country, with 3.2 million tons.

Since 2006, Paraná has been leading the production of beans in Brazil. Brazil is the 3rd largest producer of beans in the world, with an annual harvest of around 3 million tons, 11% of world production. In 2018, the South Region was the main bean producer with 26.4% of the total, followed by the Midwest (25.4%), Southeast Region (25.1%), Northeast (20.6%) and North (2.5%). The State of Paraná leads the ranking of the main national producers with 18.9% of the total produced.

Paraná is the 2nd largest national producer of wheat, with 2.2 million tons in 2019, almost equal to Rio Grande do Sul, the biggest producer. The South Region is also the largest producer of oats in Brazil. In 2019, national production was close to 800 thousand tons, being almost all carried out in the South (Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul).

About orange, Paraná was the 3rd largest producer in Brazil in 2018, with a total of 834 thousand tons.

Although not a large production, Paraná is the Brazilian leader in the production of barley. The state harvested 219.2 thousand tons in 2019, 60% of the national production. However, Brazil is far from being self-sufficient in the production of barley. The Brazilian market consumes, on average, 1.5 million tons per year. Brazil produces 335 thousand tons, close to 22%. Most, 73%, come from Argentina and Uruguay.

In 2018, Paraná was the 4th largest produce of tangerine in Brazil. Paraná also has a part of the production of peaches in Brazil. In 2019, in Brazil, there was a total production area of around 4 thousand hectares of strawberry. Paraná was the 4th largest producers in the country.

In coffee, Paraná is the producer state located further south in the country. It was once the largest producing state in Brazil: in 1962, Paraná accounted for 58% of national production, but in 2017, it had only 2.7% of the total produced in the country. The coffee culture has been replaced by other planting crops, and the state&#x27;s focus today has been to invest in special, more expensive coffee beans.

In 2019, Brazil produced about 900 thousand tons of yerba mate annually, according to the IBGE. Paraná is the largest producer in volume and Rio Grande do Sul in plantation areas (and where the sector is more industrialized). According to 2017 data, Paraná harvested 301 thousand tons of yerba mate by extractive method, and 237 thousand tons in plantation. The productive potential of yerba mate is still little explored in Brazil, with a good part of the harvest carried out by the extractive system and with low levels of productivity. However, many new producers are adopting more professional and efficient production systems, with technical acuity of management and globalized market vision. This tends to increase Brazil&#x27;s export of this product.

In 2017, the state&#x27;s cattle herd was 9.3 million head, 10th place in the country.

In 2018, Paraná produced a total of 4.4 billion liters of milk, making it the 2nd largest producer in the country. The city of Castro was the largest producer in the country in 2018, with 292 million liters of milk.

In pork, the 3 southern states are the largest producers in the country. Brazil had 41.1 million head in 2017. Paraná (17.2%) is the 2nd largest producer.

The Brazilian poultry flock, in 2018, was of the order of 1.5 billion heads. In 2017, the biggest poultry producing state in Brazil was Paraná (25.3%). In terms of chickens, in 2017 there were 242.8 million heads in the country. Among the states that were the largest producers, São Paulo led with 21.9%, followed by Paraná (10.1%). In the production of chicken eggs, the state ranks 2nd in Brazil, with 9,6% of national production.

In fish farming, western Paraná, in municipalities close to Toledo and Cascavel, has become the largest fish-producing region in the country, with tilapia as the main cultivated species. The west represents 69% of all production in Paraná, the largest national producer, with 112 thousand tons. Of this amount, 91% refer to tilapia breeding.

The South region was the main producer of honey in the country in 2017, accounting for 39.7% of the national total. Paraná was the 2nd largest producer in the country, with 14.3%.
About industry, Paraná had an industrial GDP of R $92.8 billion in 2017, equivalent to 7.8% of the national industry. It employs 763,064 workers in the industry. The main industrial sectors are: Food (19.1%), Industrial Services of Public Utility, such as Electricity and Water (18.5%), Construction (17.3%), Motor Vehicles (8.1%), and Petroleum Derivatives and Biofuels (5.7%). These 5 sectors concentrate 68.7% of the state&#x27;s industry.

In Brazil, the automotive sector represents close to 22% of industrial GDP. In 2019 the state came 2nd in national vehicle production, with a share of 15%. The state has Volkswagen, Renault, Audi, Volvo and DAF plants.

In the paper and cellulose sector, Brazilian pulp production was 19.691 million tons in 2019. The country exported US$7.48 billion in pulp this year, US$3.25 billion only to China. Brazilian forest-based industry exports totaled US$9.7 billion (US$7.48 billion in cellulose, US$2 billion in paper and US$265 million in wood panels). Paper production was 10.535 million tons in 2019. The country exported 2.163 million tons. In 2016, the paper and cellulose industry in the South of the country represented 33% of the national total. This year, Paraná was the national leader in the production of roundwood (mainly eucalyptus) for the pulp and paper industry (15.9 million m3); Brazil was the second country that produced the most cellulose in the world and the eighth in the production of paper. The city that most produced these woods in Brazil was Telêmaco Borba (PR), and the 5th largest was Ortigueira (PR). In 2016, the top five states producing logs for paper and cellulose (mainly eucalyptus) were: Paraná (15.9 million m3), São Paulo (14.7 million m3), Bahia (13.6 million m3), Mato Grosso do Sul (9.9 million m3) and Minas Gerais (7.8 million m3). Together, they correspond to 72.7% of the national production of 85.1 million m3. The ten largest producing municipalities had 22.9% of the country&#x27;s production. They were the cities of Telêmaco Borba (PR), Três Lagoas (MS), Caravelas (BA), Mucuri (BA), Ortigueira (PR), São Mateus (ES), Dom Eliseu (PR), Nova Viçosa (BA), Water Clara (MS) and Ribas do Rio Pardo (MS).

Paraná is the largest producer of oil shale in Brazil. In the city of São Mateus do Sul, there is a Petrobras plant specialized in the production of the material. Approximately 7,800 tons are processed daily.

In Food industry, In 2019, Brazil was the 2nd largest exporter of processed foods in the world, with a value of U $34.1 billion in exports. The Brazilian food and beverage industry&#x27;s revenue in 2019 was R $699.9 billion, 9.7% of the country&#x27;s Gross Domestic Product. In 2015, the industrial food and beverage sector in Brazil comprised 34,800 companies (not counting bakeries), the vast majority of which were small. These companies employed more than 1,600,000 workers, making the food and beverage industry the largest employer in the manufacturing industry. There are around 570 large companies in Brazil, which concentrate a good part of the total industry revenue. Paraná created food companies of national importance such as Frimesa, C.Vale, Nutrimental, Copacol, Coopavel and Matte Leão.

In Electronics industry, the turnover of industries in Brazil reached R $153.0 billion in 2019, about 3% of the national GDP. The number of employees in the sector was 234.5 thousand people. Exports were US$5.6 billion, and the country&#x27;s imports were US$32.0 billion. Brazil, despite its efforts over the decades to get rid of the dependence on technology imports, has not yet managed to reach this level. Imports are concentrated in expensive components, such as processors, microcontrollers, memories, under-mounted magnetic disks, lasers, LED and LCD. Cables for telecommunication and electricity distribution, wires, optical fibers and connectors are manufactured in the country. Brazil has two large electro-electronic production hubs, located in the Metropolitan Region of Campinas, in the State of São Paulo, and in Free Economic Zone of Manaus, in the State of Amazonas. There are large internationally renowned technology companies, as well as part of the industries that participate in its supply chain. The country also has other smaller centers, and one of them is at Curitiba, capital of Paraná.

<text>Maranhão () is a state in Brazil. Located in the country&#x27;s Northeast Region, it has a population of about 7 million and an area of and it is divided into 217 municipalities. Clockwise from north, it borders on the Atlantic Ocean for 2,243 km and the states of Piauí, Tocantins and Pará. The people of Maranhão have a distinctive accent within the common Northeastern Brazilian dialect. Maranhão is described in literary works such as &quot;Exile Song&quot; by Gonçalves Dias and &quot;Casa de Pensão&quot; by Aluísio Azevedo.

The dunes of Lençóis are an important area of environmental preservation. Also of interest is the state capital of São Luís, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Another important conservation area is the Parnaíba River delta, between the states of Maranhão and Piauí, with its lagoons, desert dunes and deserted beaches or islands, such as Caju island, which shelters rare birds.

==Geography==


The northern portion of the state is a heavily forested plain traversed by numerous rivers, occupied by the eastern extension of the tropical moist forests of Amazonia. The Tocantins–Araguaia–Maranhão moist forests occupy the northwestern portion of the state, extending from the Pindaré River west into neighboring Pará state. The north-central and northeastern portion of the state, extending eastward into northern Piauí, is home to the Maranhão Babaçu forests, a tropical moist forest ecoregion dominated by the Babaçu palm. The Babaçu palm produces oil which is extracted commercially and used for a variety of purposes including food and beauty products.

The southern portion of the state belong to the lower terraces of the great Brazilian Highlands, occupied by the Cerrado savannas. Several plateau escarpments, including the Chapada das Mangabeiras, Serra do Tiracambu, and Serra das Alpercatas, mark the state&#x27;s northern margin and the outlines of river valleys.

The climate is hot, and the year is divided into a wet and dry season. Extreme humidity characterizes the wet season. The heat, however, is greatly modified on the coast by the south-east trade winds.

The rivers of the state all flow northward to the Atlantic and a majority have navigable channels. The Gurupí River forms the northwestern boundary of the state, separating Maranhão from neighboring Pará. The Tocantins River forms part the state&#x27;s southwestern boundary with Tocantins state. The Parnaíba River forms the eastern boundary of Maranhão, but it has one large tributary, the Balsas, entirely within the state. Other rivers in the state include the Turiassu (or Turiaçu) which runs just east of the Gurupi, emptying into the Baía de Turiassu; the Mearim, Pindaré, and Grajaú, which empty into the Baía de São Marcos; and the Itapecuru and Munim which discharge into the Baía de São José. Like the Amazon, the Mearim has a &quot;pororoca&quot; or tidal bore in its lower channel, which greatly interferes with navigation.

The western coastline has many small indentations, which are usually masked by islands or shoals. The largest of these are the Baía de Turiassu, facing which is São João Island, and the contiguous bays of São Marcos and São José, between which is the large island of São Luís. This indented shoreline is home to the Maranhão mangroves, the tallest mangrove forests in the world. The coastline east of Baía de São José is less indented and characterized by sand dunes, including the stark dune fields of the Lençóis Maranhenses National Park, as well as restinga forests that form on stabilized dunes.

===Highest point=== 
Chapada das Mangabeiras 804 m, at 10º 15&#x27; 45&quot; S, 46º 00&#x27; 15&quot; W.

==History==


The etymology of Maranhão is uncertain; the name probably originates from Portuguese settlers from Maranhão in Avis in the province of Alentejo. The word was first used to refer to the Amazon River, which is today used to refer to the Peruvian part of the river (Marañón).

The first known European to explore Maranhão was the Spanish explorer Vicente Yáñez Pinzón in 1500, but it was granted to João de Barros in 1534 as a Portuguese hereditary captaincy. The first European settlement, however, was made by a French trading expedition under Jacques Riffault, of Dieppe, in 1594, who lost two of his three vessels in the vicinity of São Luís Island, and left a part of his men on that island when he returned home. Subsequently, Daniel de La Touche, Seigneur de La Rividière was sent to report on the place, and was then commissioned by the French crown to found a colony on the island (Equinoctial France); this was done in 1612. The French were expelled by the Portuguese in 1615, and the Dutch held the island from 1641 to 1644. In 1621 Ceará, Maranhão and Pará were united and called the &quot;Estado do Maranhao&quot;, which was separated from the southern captaincies. Very successful Indian missions were soon begun by the Jesuits, who were temporarily expelled as a result of a civil war in 1684 for their opposition to the enslavement of the Indians. Ceará was subsequently detached, but the State of Maranhão remained separate until 1774, when it again became subject to the colonial administration of Brazil.

In the late 18th century, there was a great influx of enslaved peoples into the region, which corresponded to the increased cultivation of cotton. According to the historian Sven Beckert, the region&#x27;s cotton exports &quot;doubled between 1770 and 1780, nearly doubled again by 1790, and nearly tripled once more by 1800.&quot;

Maranhão did not join in the Brazilian declaration of independence of 1822, but in the following year the Portuguese were driven out by British sailor and liberator Admiral Lord Cochrane and it became part of the Empire of Brazil. For this achievement Lord Cochrane became 1st Marques of Maranhão and Governor of Maranhão Province.

São Luís is the Brazilian state capital which most closely resembles a Portuguese city. By the early 20th century São Luís had about 30,000 inhabitants, and contained several convents, charitable institutes, the episcopal palace, a fine Carmelite church, and an ecclesiastical seminary. The historic city center was declared a World Heritage Site in 1997.

== Demographics ==

According to the IBGE, there were 6,776,699 people residing in the state in 2022. The population density was 20.6 inhabitants/km2.

Urbanization: 68.1% (2004); Population growth: 1.5% (1991–2000); Houses: 1,442,500 (2005).

Maranhão is one of the poorest states of Brazil. The state has 3.4% of the Brazilian population and produces only 1.3% of the Brazilian GDP.

The service sector is the largest component of GDP at 70%, followed by the industrial sector at 19.6%. Agriculture represents 10.4% of GDP (2015). Maranhão is the fourth-largest economy in the Northeast region and the 17th-largest in Brazil.

Maranhão exports: aluminium 50%, iron 23.7%, soybean 13.1% (2002). Share of the Brazilian economy: 0.9% (2004).

Maranhão is also known as the land of the palm trees, as the various species of this tree provide its major source of income. The most important of them, from an economic point of view, is the babassu. Agribusiness, the aluminium and alumina transformation industries, the pulp industry, natural gas production, and the food and timber industries complement the state economy.

The Maranhão agricultural sector stands out in the production of rice (fifth-largest rice production in the country, and highest in the Northeast), cassava (second-largest planted area in the Northeast), soybean, cotton (in both cases second-largest producer in the Northeast), sugarcane, corn and eucalyptus. Agriculture benefits from the infrastructure of railroads (Ferrovia Carajás and Ferrovia Norte-Sul) and ports (Itaqui and Ponta da Madeira) and the proximity to the European and American markets.

Maranhão has the second largest cattle herd in the Northeast and the 12th largest in the country, with 7.6 million animals.

The state also produces natural gas in the Parnaíba basin, with a production of 8.4 million m3 per day, used in thermal power stations. Maranhão is the 6th largest producer in the country. Maranhão also has a hydroelectric plant (Estreito Hydroelectric Plant), a wind farm (in Lençóis Maranhenses), and a thermoelectric plant (Suzano Maranhão Thermal Power Plant).

Itaqui Port annually moves millions of tons of cargo, being an important logistics corridor for the Center-West of the country. It is the second deepest port in the world. Among the main products handled in 2017 are soybeans (6,152,909 tons), corn (1,642,944 tons), fertilizers (1,536,697 tons), copper (836,062 tons), coal (636,254 tons), pig iron (505,733 t) clinker + slag (225,796 t), manganese (147,063 t), rice (89,833 t), imported liquid bulk (3,881,635 t), caustic soda (86,542 t), ethanol and LPG (150,753 t), totaling an annual turnover of 17,140,470 tons.

The port of Ponta da Madeira, belonging to the Vale do Rio Doce is mainly destined for the export of iron ore brought from the Serra dos Carajás, in Pará. Between January and November 2017, 153.466 million tons were transported, and it is the national champion in moving loads. The Alumar Consortium Port transported 13.720 million tons between January and November 2017, mainly alumina.

<doc id="229419" wikidata="Q41428" url="?curid=229419" title="Rio de Janeiro (state)">
<text>Rio de Janeiro (, ) is one of the 27 federative units of Brazil. It has the second largest economy of Brazil, with the largest being that of the state of São Paulo. The state, which has 8.2% of the Brazilian population, is responsible for 9.2% of the Brazilian GDP.

The state of Rio de Janeiro is located within the Brazilian geopolitical region classified as the Southeast (assigned by IBGE). Rio de Janeiro shares borders with all the other states in the same Southeast macroregion: Minas Gerais (N and NW), Espírito Santo (NE) and São Paulo (SW). It is bounded on the east and south by the South Atlantic Ocean. Rio de Janeiro has an area of . Its capital is the city of Rio de Janeiro, which was the capital of the Portuguese Colony of Brazil from 1763 to 1815, of the following United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves from 1815 to 1822, and of later independent Brazil as a kingdom and republic from 1822 to 1960.

The state is divided into 92 municipalities. It state&#x27;s 22 largest cities are Rio de Janeiro, São Gonçalo, Duque de Caxias, Nova Iguaçu, Niterói, Campos dos Goytacazes, Belford Roxo, São João de Meriti, Petrópolis, Volta Redonda, Magé, Macaé, Itaboraí, Cabo Frio, Armação dos Búzios, Angra dos Reis, Nova Friburgo, Barra Mansa, Barra do Piraí, Teresópolis, Mesquita and Nilópolis.

Rio de Janeiro is the smallest state by area in the Southeast macroregion and one of the smallest in Brazil. It is, however, the third most populous Brazilian state, with a population of over 16 million people at the 2022 Census (making it the most densely populated state in Brazil), and it has the third longest coastline in the country (after those of the states of Bahia and Maranhão).

In the Brazilian flag, the state is represented by Mimosa, the beta star in the Southern Cross (β Cru).

==Demonym==
The original demonym for the State of Rio de Janeiro is &quot;fluminense&quot;, from Latin &quot;flumen, fluminis&quot;, meaning &quot;river&quot;. While &quot;carioca&quot; (from Old Tupi) is an older term, first attested in 1502, &quot;fluminense&quot; was sanctioned in 1783, twenty years after the city had become the capital of the Brazilian colonies, as the official demonym of the Royal Captaincy of Rio de Janeiro and subsequently of the Province of Rio de Janeiro. From 1783 through the Imperial Regime, &quot;carioca&quot; remained an unofficial term which other Brazilians used for the inhabitants of the city as well as the province. During the first years of the Brazilian Republic, &quot;carioca&quot; came to be the name given to those who lived in the city&#x27;s slums or a pejorative used to refer to the bureaucratic elite of the Federal District. Only when the city lost its status as Federal District (to Brasília) and became the State of Guanabara in 1960 did &quot;carioca&quot; become an official demonym along with &quot;guanabarino&quot;. In 1975, Guanabara State was incorporated into Rio de Janeiro State, becoming the present City of Rio de Janeiro. &quot;Carioca&quot; became the demonym of the city, while &quot;fluminense&quot; continues to be used for the state as a whole.

==History==
===Hereditary captainships===
European presence in Rio de Janeiro dates back to 1502. Rio de Janeiro originated from parts of the captainships of de Tomé and São Vicente. Between 1555 and 1567, the territory was occupied by the French, who intended to install a colony, France Antarctique. Aiming to prevent the occupation of the Frenchmen, in March 1565, the city of Rio de Janeiro was established by Estácio de Sá.

In the 17th century, cattle raising and sugar cane cultivation stimulated the city&#x27;s progress, which was definitively assured when the port started to export gold extracted from Minas Gerais in the 18th century. In 1763, Rio de Janeiro became the capital of Colonial Brazil. With the flight of the Portuguese royal family from Portugal to Brazil in 1808, the region soon benefited from urban reforms to house the Portuguese. Chief among the promoted changes were the transformation of agencies of public administration and justice, the creation of new churches and hospitals, the foundation of the first bank of the country (the Bank of Brazil) and the Royal Press, with the Gazette do Rio of Janeiro. The following years witnessed the creation of the Jardim Botânico (Botanical Garden) and the .

There followed a process of cultural enhancement influenced not only by the arrival of the royal family, but also by the presence of European graphic artists who were hired to record the society and Brazilian natural features. During this same time, was founded as well.

===The neutral city===
In 1834, the city of Rio de Janeiro was transformed into a &quot;neutral city&quot;, remaining as capital of the state, while the captainships became provinces, with headquarters in Niterói, a neighbouring city. In 1889, the city became the capital of the Republic, the neutral city became the federal district and the province a state. In 1894, Petrópolis became the capital of Rio de Janeiro, until 1902 when Niterói recovered its capital status. With the relocation of the federal capital to Brasília in 1960, the city of Rio de Janeiro became Guanabara State. Niterói remained the state capital for Rio de Janeiro state, while Rio de Janeiro served the same status for Guanabara.

===The new state of Rio de Janeiro===

In 1975, a further change took place, with the merger of the states of Rio de Janeiro and the state of Guanabara, restoring the then city-state to the status of a municipality, governed by mayors.

In the 1970s, with the transfer of the capital to Brasilia, Rio de Janeiro began to be one of the worst states in the country in terms of economic dynamism. There was no political discussion about the course of the city after it ceased to be the country&#x27;s capital. &quot;Rio de Janeiro was a job hanger for politicians from all over Brazil. Everyone referred a friend, a relative to take a position in the federal district,&quot; explains Marieta de Moraes Ferreira, history professor at UFRJ. Left-wing governors and mayors such as Leonel Brizola, Saturnino Braga, Marcello Allencar, César Maia, Anthony Garotinho, and Benedita da Silva, among others, helped drive away many industries that still existed in the state. Combined with the incitement to favelas, where Brizola said for example that &quot;the favela is not a problem, the favela is a solution&quot;, the capital has deteriorated in a few decades, dragging down the State. The state still maintains itself as the largest oil producer in Brazil (80% of the total), where royalties and special participations brought the state 4.2 billion reais in 2014, when the barrel of oil reached $93.48. But oil revenues, used by the government to repay financing debts, including the payroll of idle workers, fell to 1.6 billion reais. The international price of a barrel fell to USD 50.48 in 2016 and reached a low of USD 28. Petrobras became the target of the largest anti-corruption operation in Brazil, with the participation of governors such as Sérgio Cabral Filho and Pezão, linked to leftist Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, pushing back investments that were to be at the forefront of the pre-salt exploration. Even when state municipalities received millions of reais in royalties, public spending was used for marginal improvements, for beautification, such as porcelain floors, whale-shaped monuments, without generating revenue or benefit. jobs for the population. Political leaders are blamed for the lack of a unified project for Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s economy.

==Geography==
The state is part of the Mata Atlântica biome and is made up of two distinct morphological areas: a coastal plain, known as &quot;baixada&quot;, and a plateau, which are disposed in parallel fashion from the shoreline on the Atlantic Ocean inland towards Minas Gerais.

The coastline extends 635 kilometers and is formed by the bays of Guanabara, Sepetiba, and Ilha Grande.
There are prominent slopes near the ocean, featuring also diverse environments, such as restinga vegetation, bays, lagoons and tropical forests.

Most of the state however consists of highlands, often higher than 1000 m, formed by several mountain chains like the Serra do Mar which separates Rio from the state of São Paulo. The highest point of the state, the Pico das Agulhas Negras (Black Needles Peak) is located in the Serra da Mantiqueira which forms the physical border with neighbouring Minas Gerais.

Its principal rivers are the Guandu, the Piraí, the Paraíba do Sul, the Macaé and the Muriaé.

===Climate===

The entire state is located within the tropics (the Tropic of Capricorn passes just a few kilometers south of the state&#x27;s southernmost point) so a tropical climate is predominant. However, due to altitude, temperatures can drop to freezing point or below in some parts. Frost is not uncommon in some mountainous cities such as Teresópolis, Nova Friburgo and Petrópolis and snow has been reported occasionally in the Itatiaia National Park.

Annual mean temperatures on the coast are around , in summer and in winter. In the mountains annual mean temperatures are around but can range from at an elevation of above sea level to in the Itatiaia National Park. Summers in these areas tend to be warm but not hot, with averages around . Winters are quite chilly by Brazilian standards with lows around 

Rains tend to be concentrated in the summer (December to March) with a dry season in the winter (June to September). Most of the state receives between of rainfall in a year.

==Demographics==
According to the IBGE of 2022, there were 16,055,174 people residing in the state. The population density was .Urbanization: 96.9% (2004); Population growth: 1.3% (1991–2000).

The last PNAD (National Household Survey) census revealed the following numbers: 6,739,901 White people (42.0%), 6,682,740 Pardo (Multiracial) people (41.6%), 2,594,253 Black people (16.2%), 21,837 Asian people (0.1%), 15,904 Amerindian people (0.1%).

People of Portuguese ancestry predominate in most of the state. The Brazilian census of 1920 showed that 39,74% of the Portuguese who lived in Brazil lived in Rio de Janeiro. Including all of the Rio de Janeiro, the proportion raised to 46,30% of the Portuguese who lived in Brazil. The numerical presence of the Portuguese was extremely high, accounting for 72% of the foreigners who lived in the capital. Portuguese born people accounted for 20,36% of the population of Rio, and those with a Portuguese father or a Portuguese mother accounted for 30,84%. In other words, native born Portuguese and their children accounted for 51,20% of the inhabitants of Rio, or a total of 267664 people in 1890.

Other European ethnic groups, such as Swiss, Finnish and Germans settled mostly in the mountainous areas (Nova Friburgo, Petrópolis, etc.) and in the capital. Italians and Spaniards are also present in the capital as well as in the surrounding cities.

There are also adherents of Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism, esoterism, neo-paganism, afro-Brazilian religions and Asian religions. Together, the adherents of these and other minorities constitute 6.2% of Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s population.

Rio de Janeiro is the state with the lowest percentage of Catholics in Brazil, and the state with the highest percentage of people without religion (such as atheists and agnostics). In addition, it is the state with the highest percentage of spiritists in Brazil. The variety of denominations is a mark of the presence of religious diversity in the demographic profile of the state.

In the past, sugar cane and later, coffee had a considerable impact on the economy of Rio de Janeiro. The area around Campos dos Goytacazes was most affected by the fall of sugar cane: at the beginning of the 20th century, Campos had 27 mills in operation and, throughout the century, it was one of the largest producers in the world. In Brazil, however, as of 2020, only two sugar mills were operating in the city. The state, which harvested about 10 million tonnes in the 1980s, reached only 1 million tonnes in 2017, when it began to recover, harvesting 1.8 million tonnes in the 2019/ 20.

The state was also an important producer of coconuts, in the regions of Quissamã and the Lakes Region, and in 2009 it was the 7th national producer, but between 2010 and 2020 several producers abandoned the activity.

The industrial sector is the largest component of GDP at 51.6%, followed by the service sector at 47.8%. Agriculture represents 0.6% of GDP (2004). Rio de Janeiro (state) exports: petroleum 44.8%, fuel 17.5%, siderurgy 13%, chemicals 3.6%, nonferrous metals 2.8%, vehicles 2.1% (2002).

==Infrastructure==
===Highways===
The state of Rio de Janeiro is one of the best in the country in terms of infrastructure, although it has some shortcomings, mainly due to its mountainous terrain. In the highway sector, there are about 800 km of highways, the main highway being BR-101, then BR-116. The Presidente Dutra highway, the name given to the BR-116 on the section that connects the country&#x27;s two main cities (São Paulo to Rio), passing through Volta Redonda, Barra Mansa and Resende, was the first duplicate highway in the country, in 1967. The section of the BR-101 is the one that connects the capital to the border with Espírito Santo, passing through important towns such as Niterói, bordering Cabo Frio and Búzios, then Macaé and finally Campos dos Goytacazes. The section between Rio Bonito and Campos, bidding to have its 176 km duplicated, already has 126 km doubled. BR-116 passes through the state&#x27;s mountainous interior and connects Rio de Janeiro to the northeastern region of Brazil. The BR-040 connects Rio to Minas Gerais and its capital Belo Horizonte. Also of note is the Metropolitan Arc, which surrounds the capital with the aim of removing unnecessary traffic from this area, and which is in the process of being fully completed, with only 23 km of duplication of an old existing section missing. Recently, the Presidente Dutra highway was re-tendered to enable a billion-dollar upgrade project for the Serra das Araras road, the oldest section of the highway, built in the 1920s. Generally, the state&#x27;s highways have a large movement of freight and passenger vehicles.

The main Federal highways that cross the state are:
* BR-101
* BR-116
* BR-040
* BR-354

<text>São Paulo (, ) is one of the 26 states of the Federative Republic of Brazil and is named after Saint Paul of Tarsus. It is located in the Southeast Region and is bordered by the states of Minas Gerais to the north and northeast, Paraná to the south, Rio de Janeiro to the east and Mato Grosso do Sul to the west, in addition to the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast. It is divided into 645 municipalities. The total area is km2, which is equivalent to 2.9% of Brazil&#x27;s surface, being slightly larger than the United Kingdom. Its capital is the municipality of São Paulo.

With more than 44 million inhabitants in 2022, São Paulo is the most populous Brazilian state (around 22% of the Brazilian population), the world&#x27;s 28th-most-populous sub-national entity and the most populous sub-national entity in the Americas, and the fourth-most-populous political entity of South America, surpassed only by the rest of the Brazilian federation, Colombia, and Argentina. The local population is one of the most diverse in the country and descended mostly from Italians, who began immigrating to the country in the late 19th century; the Portuguese, who colonized Brazil and installed the first European settlements in the region; Indigenous peoples, many distinct ethnic groups; Africans, who were brought from Africa as enslaved people in the colonial era and migrants from other regions of the country. In addition, Arabs, Armenians, Chinese, Germans, Greeks, Japanese, Spanish and American Southerners also are present in the ethnic composition of the local population.

Today&#x27;s area corresponds to the state territory inhabited by Indigenous peoples from approximately 12,000 BC. In the early 16th century, the coast of the region was visited by Portuguese and Spanish explorers and navigators. In 1532 Martim Afonso de Sousa would establish the first Portuguese permanent settlement in the Americas—the village of São Vicente, in the Baixada Santista. In the 17th century, the paulistas &quot;bandeirantes&quot; intensified the exploration of the colony&#x27;s interior, which eventually expanded the territorial domain of Portugal and the Portuguese Empire in South America. In the 18th century, after the establishment of the province of São Paulo, the region began to gain political weight. After independence in 1822, São Paulo began to become a major agricultural producer (mainly coffee) in the newly constituted Empire of Brazil, which ultimately created a rich regional rural oligarchy, which would switch on the command of the Brazilian government with Minas Gerais&#x27;s elites during the early republican period in the 1890s. Under the Vargas Era, the state was one of the first to initiate a process of industrialization and its population became one of the most urban of the federation.

São Paulo&#x27;s economy is very strong and diversified, having the largest industrial, scientific and technological production in the country — being the largest national research and development hub and home to the best universities and institutes —, the world&#x27;s largest production of orange juice, sugar and ethanol, and the highest GDP among all Brazilian states, being the only one to exceed the one-trillion-real range. In 2020, São Paulo&#x27;s economy accounted for around 31.2% of the total wealth produced in the country — which made the state known as the &quot;locomotive of Brazil&quot; — and this is reflected in its cities, many of which are among the richest and most developed in the country. São Paulo alone is wealthier than Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Bolivia combined, with a GDP of 2.7 trillion reais (603.4 billion dollars); therefore, if it were a sovereign country, its nominal GDP would be the 21st largest in the world (2020 estimate). In addition to the economy, São Paulo is acknowledged as a major Brazilian tourist destination by national and international tourists due to its natural beauty, historical and cultural heritage —it has multiple sites inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List—, inland resorts, climate and great vocation for the service, business, entertainment, fashion sectors, culture, leisure, health, education, and many others. It has high social indices compared to those recorded in the rest of the country, such as the second-highest Human Development Index (HDI), the fourth GRDP per capita, the second-lowest infant mortality rate, the third-highest life expectancy, the lowest homicide rate, and the third-lowest rate of illiteracy among the federative units of Brazil.

==History==
===Early period===
The region of the current state of São Paulo was already inhabited by Amerindian peoples since at least approximately 10,000 BCE, as evidenced by studies carried out in ancient archaeological sites (such as the sites Caetetuba, Bastos, Boa Esperança II and Lagoa do Camargo) in different parts of the current territory of São Paulo. There are even records (e.g. - studies at the Rincão I archaeological site) that suggest that ancient human occupation was already present in São Paulo 17 thousand years ago, during the last glacial maximum. There are also several archaeological sites (such as Caetetuba, Alice Boer and Rincão I) in the central portion of the state that share similar patterns of working rocks into stone points and plano-convex artifacts similar to each other, so that they are seen as members of the same ancient ancestral culture, linked to the Rioclarense lithic industry. These ancient human groups were hunter-gatherers, living as nomads and semi-nomads in the current territory of São Paulo, living directly from what they could obtain from the local land.

In pre-European times, the area that is now São Paulo state was occupied by the Tupi people&#x27;s nation, who subsisted through hunting and cultivation. The first European to settle in the area was João Ramalho, a Portuguese sailor who may have been shipwrecked around 1510, ten years after the first Portuguese landfall in Brazil. He married the daughter of a local chieftain and became a settler. In 1532, the first colonial expedition, led by Martim Afonso de Sousa of Portugal, landed at São Vicente (near the present-day port at Santos). De Sousa added Ramalho&#x27;s settlement to his colony.
Early European colonization of Brazil was very limited. Portugal was more interested in Africa and Asia. But with English and French raiding privateer ships just off the coast, the territory had to be protected. Unwilling to shoulder the naval defense burden himself, the Portuguese ruler, King Joao III, divided the coast into &quot;captaincies&quot;, or swathes of land, 50 leagues apart. He distributed them among well-connected Portuguese, hoping that each would be self-reliant. The early port and sugar-cultivating settlement of São Vicente was one rare success connected to this policy. In 1548, João III brought Brazil under direct royal control.

Fearing Indian attack, he discouraged development of the territory&#x27;s vast interior. Some whites headed nonetheless for Piratininga, a plateau near São Vicente, drawn by its navigable rivers and agricultural potential. Borda do Campo, the plateau settlement, became an official town (Santo André da Borda do Campo) in 1553. The history of São Paulo city proper begins with the founding of a Jesuit mission of the Roman Catholic order of clergy on 25 January 1554—the anniversary of Saint Paul&#x27;s conversion. The station, which is at the heart of the current city, was named São Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga (or just Pateo do Colégio). In 1560, the threat of Indian attack led many to flee from the exposed Santo André da Borda do Campo to the walled fortified Colegio. Two years later, the Colégio was besieged. Though the town survived, fighting took place sporadically for another three decades.

By 1600, the town had about 1,500 citizens and 150 households. Little was produced for export, save a number of agricultural goods. The isolation was to continue for many years, as the development of Brazil centered on the sugar plantations in the north-east.

The city&#x27;s location, at the mouth of the Tietê-Paranapanema river system (which winds into the interior), made it an ideal base for another activity—enslaving expeditions. The economics were simple. Enslaved manpower for Brazil&#x27;s northern sugar plantations were in short supply. Enslaved Africans were expensive, so demand for indigenous captives soared. The task was, nonetheless, hard, if not impossible, to achieve.

===Expansion===

Among those who attempted to enslave the native were explorers of the hinterland called &quot;bandeirantes&quot;. From their base in São Paulo, they also combed the interior in search of natural riches. Silver, gold and diamonds were companion pursuits, as well as the exploration of unknown territories. Roman Catholic missionaries sometimes tagged along, as efforts at converting the natives aborigines (Indians) worked hand in hand with Portuguese colonialism.

Despite their atrocities, the wild and hardy bandeirantes are now equally remembered for penetrating Brazil&#x27;s vast interior. Trading posts established by them became permanent settlements. Interior routes opened up. Though the &quot;bandeirantes&quot; had no loyalty to the Portuguese crown, they did claim land for the king. Thus, the borders of Brazil were pushed forward to the northwest and the Amazon region and west to the Andes Mountains.

French Emperor Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Portugal in 1807 prompted the British with their vast powerful Royal Navy to evacuate King João VI of Portugal, Portugal&#x27;s prince regent, from the capital Lisbon, across the Atlantic to Rio de Janeiro and Brazil then became the first overseas colony to become the temporary headquarters of the Portuguese Empire. João VI rewarded his hosts with economic reforms that would prove crucial to São Paulo&#x27;s rise. Brazil&#x27;s ports—long closed to non-Portuguese ships—were opened up to international trade. Restrictions on domestic manufacturing were waived.

When Napoleon was defeated in 1815, with the end of the Napoleonic Wars, João gave political shape to his territory, which soon became the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. Portugal and Brazil, in other words, were ostensibly co-equals. Returning to Portugal six years later, João left his son, Pedro, to rule as regent and governor.
===Empire of Brazil period===
Pedro I of Brazil inherited his father&#x27;s love of Brazil, resisting demands from Lisbon that Brazil should be ruled from Europe once again. Legend has it that in 1822 the regent was riding outside São Paulo when a messenger delivered a missive demanding his return to Europe, and Dom Pedro waved his sword and shouted &quot;Independência ou morte!&quot; (Independence or death).

João had whetted the appetite of Brazilians, who now sought a full break from the monarchy. The ever-restless Paulistas were at the vanguard of the independence movement. The small mother country of Portugal was in no position to resist—on 7 September 1822, Dom Pedro rubber-stamped Brazil&#x27;s independence. He was crowned emperor shortly afterwards. The emperors ruled an independent Brazil until 1889. Over this time, the growth of liberalism in Europe had a parallel in Brazil. As the Brazilian provinces became more assertive, São Paulo was the scene of a minor (and unsuccessful) liberal revolution in 1842. When independence was declared, the city of São Paulo had just 25,000 people and 4,000 houses, but the next 60 years would see gradual growth. In 1828, the Law School, the pioneer of the city&#x27;s intellectual tradition, opened. The first newspaper, &quot;O Farol Paulistano&quot;, appeared in 1827. Municipal developments such as botanical gardens, an opera house and a library, gave the city a cultural boost.

Regardless, São Paulo still faced many hurdles, especially transport. Mule-trains were the main method of transportation, and the road from the plateau down to the port of Santos was famously arduous. In the late 1860s São Paulo got its first railway line, developed by British engineers, to the Port of Santos. Other lines, such as a railway to Campinas, were soon built. This was good timing, because in the 1880s the coffee craze hit in earnest. Brazil, which had been growing it since the mid-18th century, could grow more. The Paraíba valley, which spans the states of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, had suitable soil and climate. São Paulo city, at the western end of the Paraíba valley, was well positioned to channel the coffee to the port of Santos.

===Republican era===

Meanwhile, the Brazilian monarchy had fallen in 1889. A feudalistic regime, the new republic had friends only among the sugar planters of the Northeast, whose dominance Paulistanos, among others, despised. In 1891, a new federal constitution, which delegated power to the states, was approved. The new coffee elite saw its chance. São Paulo ironed out a power-sharing understanding—known as the &quot;café com leite&quot; (coffee-and-milk) deal—with dairy-rich Minas Gerais, Brazil&#x27;s other dominant state. Together, they held a virtual lock on federal power. Brazilian politics now became a favourite pastime of the once-rebellious Paulistanos, who sent several presidents to Rio de Janeiro—including Prudente de Morais, Brazil&#x27;s first civilian president, who took office in 1894.

Plantation labor was needed—this time for coffee, not sugar. Slavery had been fading since the import of enslaved Africans was outlawed in 1850. São Paulo, thanks to such figures as Luiz Gama (a former slave), was a center of abolitionism. In 1888, Brazil abolished slavery (it was the last country in the Americas to do so) and the freed African-Brazilians who had been helping build the nation were then forced to beg for their jobs back, working for food and shelter only because of the failure of the system to integrate them as equal citizens with Euro-Brazilians. In an effort to &quot;bleach the race&quot;, as the nation&#x27;s leaders feared Brazil was becoming a &quot;black country&quot;, Spanish, Portuguese and Italian nationals were given incentives to become farm workers in São Paulo. The state government was so eager to bring in European immigrants that it paid for their trips and provided varying levels of subsidy.

By 1893, foreigners made up over 55 percent of São Paulo&#x27;s population. Fearing oversupply, the government applied the brakes briefly in 1899; then the boom resumed. From 1908, the Japanese arrived in great numbers, many destined for the plantations on fixed-term contracts. By 1920, São Paulo was Brazil&#x27;s second-largest city; a half-century before, it had been just the tenth-largest. Immigration and migration of Paulistas from other towns as well as Nordestinos and citizens from other states, the coffee industry, and modernization through the manufacturing of textiles, car and airplane parts, as well as food and technological industries, construction, fashion, and services transformed the greater São Paulo area into a thriving megalopolis and one of the world&#x27;s greatest multiethnic regions.

===Early 20th century===

Between 1901 and 1910, coffee made up 51 percent of Brazil&#x27;s total exports, far overshadowing rubber, sugar and cotton. But reliance on coffee made Brazil (and São Paulo in particular) vulnerable to poor harvests and the whims of world markets. The development of plantations in the 1890s, and widespread reliance on credit, took place against fluctuating prices and supply levels, culminating in saturation of the international market around the start of the 20th century. The government&#x27;s policies of &quot;valorisation &quot;—borrowing money to buy coffee and stockpiling it, in order to have a surplus during bad harvests, and meanwhile taxing coffee exports to pay off loans—seemed feasible in the short term (as did its manipulation of foreign-exchange rates to the advantage of coffee growers). But in the longer term, these actions contributed to oversupply and eventual collapse.

São Paulo&#x27;s industrial development, from 1889 into the 1940s, was gradual and inward looking. Initially, industry was closely associated with agriculture: cotton plantations led to the growth of textile manufacturing. Coffee planters were among the early industrial investors.
The boom in immigration provided a market for goods, and sectors such as food processing grew. Traditional immigrant families such as the Matarazzo, Diniz, Mofarrej and Maluf became industrialists, entrepreneurs, and leading politicians.

Restrictions on imports forced by world wars and government policies of &quot;import substitution&quot; and trade tariffs, all contributed to industrial growth. By 1945, São Paulo had become the largest industrial center in South America. World War I sent ripples through Brazil. Inflation was rampant. Some 50,000 workers went on strike.

The growing of the urban population grew increasingly resentful of the coffee elite. Disaffected intellectuals expressed their views during a memorable &quot;Week of Modern Art&quot; in 1922. Two years later, a garrison of soldiers staged a revolt (eventually quashed by government troops).

The stand-off was also political: politics had been long monopolised by the Paulista Republican Party, but in 1926 a more left-leaning party rose in opposition. In 1928, the PRP amended São Paulo&#x27;s state constitution to give it more control over the city. The turbulence was mirrored on Brazil&#x27;s national scene. With the Great Depression, coffee prices plunged, as did real GDP. Americans, keen investors during the 1920s, backed away.

The opening of the first highway between São Paulo and Rio in 1928 was one of the few bright spots. Into the breach stepped Getúlio Vargas, a southerner veteran in state politics. In Brazil&#x27;s 1930 presidential elections, he opposed Júlio Prestes, a favorite son of São Paulo. Vargas lost the election, but with backing from Minas Gerais state—São Paulo&#x27;s former ally and neighbor to the north—he seized power regardless.

===Constitutionalist Revolution===

The Constitutionalist Revolution of 1932 or Paulista War is the name given to the uprising of the population of the Brazilian state of São Paulo against the federal government of Vargas. Its main goal was to press the provisional government headed by Getúlio Vargas to enact a new Constitution, since it had revoked the previous one, adopted in 1889. However, as the movement developed and resentment against President Vargas grew deeper, it came to advocate the overthrow of the Federal Government and the secession of São Paulo from the Brazilian federation. But, it is noted that the separatist scenario was used as guerrilla tactics by the Federal Government to turn the population of the rest of the country against the state of São Paulo, broadcasting the alleged separatist notion throughout the country. There is no evidence that the movement&#x27;s commanders sought separatism.

The uprising started on 9 July 1932, after five protesting students were killed by government troops on 23 May 1932. On the wake of their deaths, a movement called MMDC (from the initials of the names of each of the four students killed, Martins, Miragaia, Dráusio and Camargo) started. A fifth victim, Alvarenga, was also shot that night, but died months later.

Revolutionary troops entrenched in the battlefield. In a few months, the state of São Paulo rebelled against the federal government. Counting on the solidarity of three other powerful states, (Rio Grande do Sul, Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro), the politicians of São Paulo expected a quick war. However, that solidarity was never translated into actual support, and the São Paulo civil war was won by the Federation on 2 October 1932.

In spite of its military defeat, some of the movement&#x27;s main demands were finally granted by Vargas afterwards: the appointment of a non-military state Governor, the election of a Constituent Assembly and, finally, the enactment of a new Constitution in 1934. However that Constitution was short lived, as in 1937, amidst growing extremism on the left and right wings of the political spectrum, Vargas closed the National Congress and enacted another Constitution, which established an authoritarian regime called Estado Novo.

===Late 20th century===

Vargas&#x27;s rule was a study in political turbulence. Elected in 1934, he ruled by dictatorship (albeit a popular one, thanks to his health and social-welfare programmes) from 1937 to 1945—a period dubbed the &quot;Estado Novo&quot;. Thrown out by a coup in 1945, he ran for office again in 1950, and was overwhelmingly elected. On the verge of being overthrown from office again, he committed suicide in 1954. Vargas&#x27;s main legacy was the centralization of power.

The encouragement of industry and diversification of agriculture, not to mention the abolition of subsidies on coffee, finally did away with the dominance of the coffee oligarchies. His replacement, Juscelino Kubitschek, focused on heavy industry. Kubitschek built car factories, steel plants, hydro-power infrastructure and roads. Petrobras, Brazil&#x27;s oil monolith, was set up in 1953. By 1958, São Paulo state controlled some 55 percent of Brazil&#x27;s industrial production, up from 17 percent in 1907. Another of Kubitschek&#x27;s pet projects was the creation of Brasília, which became Brazil&#x27;s capital in 1960—the year Kubitschek stepped down. The University of São Paulo was founded in 1934; two years after São Paulo&#x27;s failed uprising. It has established itself as the most prestigious higher learning institution in the country.

With a transitional government from military to civil and a new currency that made stagnant the economy during the mid- to late 1980s, unemployment and crime became rampant. São Paulo, by now the world&#x27;s third-largest city after Mexico City and Tokyo, was hard-hit. Wealthy Brazilians retreated to suburban highly secured housing complexes such as Alphaville, and &quot;favelas&quot;, pockets of substandard living slums that lined the periphery, had a tremendous growth. For the first time in history, Brazil experienced large segments of its population immigrating to continents such as North America, Europe, Australia, and East Asia, particularly to Japan.

==Geography==

São Paulo is one of 27 states of Brazil, located southwest of the Southeast Region. The state area is , most of the north of the Tropic of Capricorn, and the 12th unit of the Brazilian federation in area and the second in the Southeast region, behind only Minas Gerais. The state has a relatively high relief, having 85 percent of its surface between three hundred and nine hundred meters above sea level, 8 percent below three hundred meters and 7 percent over nine hundred meters.

The distance between its north and south end points is , and between the east–west extremes. The state time zone follows the Brasilia time, which is three hours behind Greenwich Mean Time. It is bordered by the states of Minas Gerais to the north and northeast, Paraná to the south, Rio de Janeiro to the east, Mato Grosso do Sul to the west, and the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast.

The coastline consists of plains below , that border the Serra do Mar. Located in the Serra da Mantiqueira, Mine Stone, with above sea level, is the highest point the state territory and the fifth in the country.

São Paulo has its territory divided into 21 watersheds, inserted in three river basin districts, the largest of which is the Paraná, which covers much of the state territory. Noteworthy is the Rio Grande, which born in Minas Gerais and join with Paranaiba to form the Parana River, which separates São Paulo from Mato Grosso do Sul.

Two major rivers Paulistas tributaries of the left bank of the Paraná River are the Paranapanema, which is long and a natural divider between São Paulo and Paraná in most of its course, and the Tiete River, which has a length of and runs through the state territory from southeast to northwest, from its source in Salesópolis, to its mouth in the city of Itapura.

=== Climate ===
The state territory covers seven distinct climatic types, taking into account the temperature and rainfall. In the mountain areas of the state, there are subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot; in Köppen climate classification), in areas of high altitude such as the Serra do Mar and the Serra da Mantiqueira, having humid, hot summers and average temperatures below in the month cooler year; and oceanic (&quot;Cfb&quot; and &quot;Cwb&quot;) with regular and well distributed throughout the year and warmer summers rains.

On the coast, the climate is super-humid tropical type, very similar to the prevailing equatorial climate in the Amazon (&quot;Af&quot;), with rainfall exceeding sixty monthly millimeters in every month of the year, without the existence of a dry season. The tropical climate of altitude (&quot;Cwa&quot;), predominant in the state territory, specifically in the center of the state, is characterized by a summer rainy season and a dry season in winter, with temperatures above in the hottest month of the year. In other areas, there is tropical savanna climate (&quot;Aw&quot;) with rainfall less than in one or more months of the year and warmer, with average temperatures above during the year. There are also small areas with characteristics of monsoons (&quot;Am&quot;).
The occurrence of snow is very rare, but has been recorded in Campos do Jordão and there are also reports that the phenomenon has occurred in several parts of the south of the state, except for the Ribeira Valley. The frosts are common, especially in higher areas with altitude of .

=== Environment ===
São Paulo&#x27;s territory is located, for the most part, in the Atlantic Forest biome, whose initial formation covered just over two thirds of São Paulo&#x27;s territory and today is only spread out in several fragments, with 32.6% of the original remnants remaining today, most of it on the slopes of Serra do Mar. In the cerrado biome, typical of areas in the center-west of São Paulo, this number is even lower, at just 3%. On the coast there are small areas of dunes, with plant species adapted to heat and salinity, in addition to restingas and mangroves, the latter at the mouths of rivers. As it is located at the junction of the tropical and temperate zones of the planet, São Paulo has its fauna and flora made up of species from both tropical and subtropical regions, some of which are endemic.

In 2020, only 22.9% of São Paulo&#x27;s territory, or 5,670,532 hectares (ha), were covered by native vegetation, both untouched and in the regeneration stage. That same year, São Paulo had 102 state conservation units and thirteen more federal ones, among areas of environmental protection and relevant ecological interest, ecological stations, national and state forests and parks, wildlife refuges, extractive and sustainable development reserves and also private natural heritage reserves (RPPN).

== Demographics ==

According to the IBGE estimates for 2022, there were 44,411,238 people residing in the state. The population density was . 

The 2022 census revealed the following numbers: 25,661,895 White people (57.8%), 14,636,695 Brown (Multiracial) people (33%), 3,546,562 Black people (8%), 513,066 Asian people (1.2%), and 50,528 Amerindian people (0.1%).

People of Italian descent predominate in many towns, including the capital city, where 48 percent of the population has at least one Italian ancestor. The Italians mostly came from Veneto and Campania. There are 32 million descendants of Italians in Brazil, half of whom live in the state of São Paulo. Estimates point to 16 million descendants of Italians in São Paulo, around 35% of the state.

Portuguese and Spanish descendants predominate in most towns. Most of the Portuguese immigrants and settlers came from the Entre-Douro-e-Minho Province in northern Portugal, the Spanish immigrants mostly came from Galicia and Andalusia.
People of African or Mixed background are relatively numerous. São Paulo is also home to the largest Asian population in Brazil, as well to the largest Japanese community outside Japan itself.

There are many people of Levantine descent, mostly Syrian and Lebanese. The majority of Brazilian Jews live in the state, especially in the capital city but there are also communities in Greater São Paulo, Santos, Guarujá, Campinas, Valinhos, Vinhedo, São José dos Campos, Ribeirão Preto, Sorocaba and Itu.

People of more than 70 different nationalities emigrated to Brazil in the past centuries, most of them through the Port of Santos in Santos, São Paulo. Although many of them spread to other areas of Brazil, São Paulo can be considered a true melting-pot. People of German, Hungarian, Lithuanian, Russian, Chinese, Korean, Polish, American, Bolivian, Greek and French background, as well as dozens of other immigrant groups, form sizable groups in the state.

Thousands of Southern refugees from the American Civil War, called Confederados, emigrated to Brazil, with many settling in São Paulo.

According to an autosomal DNA genetic study from 2006, European genes account for 79% of the heritage of the people of São Paulo state, 14% are of African origin, and 7% Native American. A genetic study, from 2013, showed the overall composition of São Paulo to be: 61.9% European, 25.5% African and 11.6% Native American, respectively.

The city of São Paulo, the homonymous state capital, is ranked as the world&#x27;s 12th largest city and its metropolitan area, with 20 million inhabitants, is the 9th largest in the world and first in the Americas. Regions near the city of São Paulo are also metropolitan areas, such as Campinas, Santos, Sorocaba and São José dos Campos. The total population of these areas coupled with the state capital—the so-called &quot;Expanded Metropolitan Complex of São Paulo&quot;—exceeds 30 million inhabitants, i.e. approximately 75 percent of the population of São Paulo statewide, the first macro-metropolis in the southern hemisphere, joining 65 municipalities that together are home to 12 percent of the Brazilian population.

=== Metropolitan areas and urban agglomerations ===
The Metropolitan Region of São Paulo (RMSP), also known as Greater São Paulo, was established by federal complementary law nº 14 of 1973 and is made up of 39 municipalities in São Paulo, some of them in conurbations with a core city, São Paulo, forming a large continuous urban spot. It is the most populous metropolitan region in Brazil and one of the largest in the world, with an estimated population of approximately 21 million inhabitants in 2022, almost half of the state&#x27;s population. It is in the RMSP that the municipalities with the highest population density in the state of São Paulo are found: Taboão da Serra (13.416 inhabitants/km2), Diadema (12.795 inhabitants/km2), Osasco (11.445 inhab./km2), Carapicuíba (11.205 inhab./km2), São Caetano do Sul (10.805 inhab./km2), and São Paulo (7.527 inhab./km2).

=== Religion ===

According to the 2010 demographic census, of the total population of the state, there were 24 781 288 Roman Catholics (60.06%), 9 937 853 Protestants or evangelicals (24.08%), 1 356 193 spiritists (3.29%), 444 968 Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses (1.08%), 153 564 Buddhists (0.37%), 141 553 Umbanda and Candomblecists (0.34%), 81 810 Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church (0.20%), 70 856 new Eastern religious (0.17%), 65 556 Mormons (0.16%), 51 050, Jewish (0.12%), 31 618 Orthodox Christians (0.08%), 20 375 spiritualists (0.05%), Esoteric 17 827 (0.04%), 14 778 Islamic (0.04%), 4,591 belonging to indigenous traditions (0.01%) and 1,822 Hindus (0.00%). There were still 3 357 682 people without religion (8.14%), 214 332 with indeterminate religion or multiple membership (0.52%), 50 153 did not know (0.12%) and 18 038 did not declare (0.04%).

===Crime===
São Paulo, as well as other states of Brazil, has two types of police forces to carry out public safety in their territory, the Military Police of São Paulo State (PMESP), the largest police in Brazil and the third largest in Latin America, with 138,000 soldiers, and the Civil Police of the State of São Paulo, which exercises judicial police function and is subordinate to the state government.

According to data from the &quot;Map of Violence 2011&quot;, published by the Sangari Institute and the Ministry of Justice, the homicide rate per 100,000 inhabitants in the state of São Paulo is the lowest in Brazil. The number of homicides in São Paulo fell from 39.7 to 10.1 per 100,000 inhabitants between 1998 and 2014. The state, which occupied the 5th place among the most violent states in the country in 1998, then came to occupy the 27th position in 2016.

In 2019, according to data from the Public Security Secretariat, the state reached a rate of 6.27 homicides per 100 thousand inhabitants, a special reduction compared to the number recorded in 1999, which was 35.27 homicides per 100 thousand inhabitants inhabitants. The state&#x27;s current homicide rate is below what is considered bearable by the World Health Organization, which is below homicides per 100,000 inhabitants (2023). Other crime rates also fell during the period studied, such as rape, which saw a large reduction.

According to the 2022 Brazilian Security Yearbook, São Paulo has the lowest rate of violent deaths recorded in the country, having 7 of the 10 least violent cities in Brazil.

=== Health ===

The state of São Paulo is the country&#x27;s main health hub, while its capital, the city of São Paulo, has established itself as the Latin American health capital, being the one that receives the most foreigners in search of medical treatments and diagnoses. The city receives patients from all over the world. The first healthcare institution outside the US to receive Joint Commission International (JCI) accreditation was the Albert Einstein hospital.

According to a survey carried out by IBGE in 2013, 71.8% of the population of São Paulo evaluates their health as good or very good — placing the State among those with the highest proportions of people who declared a positive self-rated health; the national average was 66.1%. In 2008, 72.7% of the population reported having regular medical appointments; 45.2% of the inhabitants consult the dentist regularly and 6.5% of the population was admitted to a hospital bed in the last twelve months. 33.7% of the inhabitants reported having a chronic illness and only 40.1% had health insurance. Another significant fact is the fact that 28.9% of the inhabitants declare that they always need the Family Health Unit Program — PUSF.

Regarding female health, 49.7% of women over 40 years of age had a clinical breast exam in the last twelve months; 64.9% of women between 50 and 69 years old had a mammography in the last two years; and 84.4% of women aged 25 to 59 had a cervical cancer screening in the last three years. More recent data from 2012 shows that the birth rate in the state of São Paulo was 14.71 per thousand inhabitants and the mortality rate was 13.17 per thousand live births, one of the lowest in the country.

===Education and science===

Covered by a significant number of renowned educational institutions and centers of excellence, São Paulo is the largest research and development hub in Brazil, responsible for 52% of Brazilian scientific production and 0.7% of world production in the period between the years 1998 and 2002. Its capital is one of the world&#x27;s main high-impact science centers. The illiteracy rate indicated by the last IBGE demographic census in 2022 was 2.2%, the 3rd lowest in the country, alongside Santa Catarina. The functional illiteracy rate was 13.2% in 2010. With 15.027 primary schools, 12.539 pre-school units, 5.639 secondary schools and more than 578 universities, the state&#x27;s education network is the largest in the country.

The HDI education factor in the state in 2005 reached the mark of 0.921 - a very high level, in accordance with the standards of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).

Among the many higher education institutions, the University of São Paulo (USP) stands out, classified as the best in Latin America and frequently cited among the best universities in the world, reaching 22nd position in 2021; the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), the largest producer of research patents in Brazil; the São Paulo State University (UNESP), the 485th best university on the planet and the 16th best in Latin America. The three universities, all maintained by the São Paulo government, are maintained by around 10% state revenue from the Tax on Circulation of Goods and Services (ICMS) and by funds from public institutions that promote research, with emphasis on the Fundação de Amparo to Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (FAPESP) and the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (formerly the National Research Council, whose acronym, CNPq, was maintained).

Among those maintained by the federal government, the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar), Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP), the Federal University of ABC (UFABC) and the Technological Institute of Aeronautics (ITA), the latter a center reference in engineering education. The state also has private universities of great national and international reputation, such as the Pontifical Catholic University of São Paulo (PUC-SP), the Universidade Presbiteriana Mackenzie, the Escola Superior de Propaganda e Marketing (ESPM), the Armando Alvares Penteado Foundation (FAAP ) and the Education and Research Institute (INSPER).

In addition to many universities, in the field of science and technology, São Paulo has important research institutes, including: Institute for Technological Research (IPT), Institute for Energy and Nuclear Research (IPEN), Butantan Institute, Biological Institute, Pasteur Institute, the Institute of Medicine Tropical (IMTSP), Forestry Institute, National Institute for Space Research (INPE), National Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNS) and Agronomic Institute of Campinas (IAC).

==Government and politics==
The Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) held the governorship and the speakership of the state&#x27; Legislative Assembly from 1994 to 2022, when governor Rodrigo Garcia, lost the election to Tarcisio de Freitas (Republicanos). Local politicians of note (with party affiliations) include: former President of Brazil (1994–2002) Fernando Henrique Cardoso (PSDB), former president (2002–2010) Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT), José Serra (PSDB), Geraldo Alckmin (PSB), Mário Covas (PSDB), Antonio Palocci (PT), Eduardo Suplicy (PT), Aloizio Mercadante (PT), Marta Suplicy (MDB), Gilberto Kassab (PSD), and Paulo Maluf (PP).

Three of last four Brazilian presidents, Fernando Henrique Cardoso (PSDB), Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) and Michel Temer (MDB) were politicians from São Paulo, although Cardoso was actually born in the state of Rio de Janeiro and Lula in Pernambuco. Cardoso and Lula respectively live in the cities of São Paulo and São Bernardo do Campo. The former president Jair Bolsonaro (PL) was born in small town of Glicério, in the state northwest, but built his political career in the state of Rio de Janeiro.

==Economy==
In 2009 the service sector was the largest component of GDP at 69%, followed by the industrial sector at 31%. Agriculture represents 2% of GDP. The state produces 34% of Brazilian goods and services. São Paulo (state) exports: vehicles 17%, airplanes and helicopters 12%, food industry 10%, sugar and alcohol fuel 8%, orange juice 5%, telecommunications 4% (2002).

São Paulo state is responsible for approximately a third of Brazilian GDP. The state&#x27;s GDP (PPP) amounts US$1.221 trillion, making it the biggest economy in Latin America and in the Southern Hemisphere. Its economy is based on machinery, the automobile and aviation industries, services, financial companies, commerce, textiles, orange growing, sugar cane and coffee bean production.

São Paulo, one of the largest economic poles in both Latin and South America, has a diversified economy. Some of the largest industries are metal-mechanics, sugar cane, textile and car and aviation manufacturing. Service and financial sectors, as well as the cultivation of oranges, cane sugar and coffee form the basis of an economy which accounts for 34% of Brazil&#x27;s GDP (equivalent to US$727.053 billion).

The towns of Campinas, Ribeirão Preto, Bauru, São José do Rio Preto, Piracicaba, Jaú, Marilia, Botucatu, Assis, and Ourinhos are important university, engineering, agricultural, zoo-technique, technology, or health sciences centers. The Instituto Butantan in São Paulo is a herpetology serpentary science center that collects snakes and other poisonous animals, as it produces venom antidotes. The Instituto Pasteur produces medical vaccines. The state is also at the vanguard of ethanol production, soybeans, aircraft construction in São José dos Campos, and its rivers have been important in generating electricity through its hydroelectric plants.

Moreover, São Paulo is one of the world&#x27;s most important sources of beans, rice, oranges and other fruit, coffee, sugar cane, alcohol, flowers and vegetables, maize, cattle, swine, milk, cheese, wine, and oil producers. Textile and manufacturing centers such as Rua José Paulino and 25 de Março in São Paulo city is a magnet for retail shopping and shipping that attracts customers from the whole country and as far as Cape Verde and Angola in Africa.

=== Primary sector ===
In agriculture, it is a giant producer of sugar cane and oranges, and also has large production of coffee, soy, maize, bananas, peanuts, lemons, persimmons, tangerines, cassavas, carrots, potatoes and strawberries.

In 2019, São Paulo produced 425,617,093 tons of sugar cane. São Paulo production is equivalent to 56.5% of the Brazilian production of 752,895,389 tons, exceeds the production of India (2nd largest world producer of cane) in 2019 (which was 405,416,180 tons) and was equivalent to 21.85% of the world cane production in the same year (1,949,310,108 tons).

In 2019, São Paulo produced 13,256,246 tons of oranges. São Paulo production is equivalent to 78% of Brazilian production of 17,073,593 tons, exceeds the production of China (2nd largest orange producer in the world) of 2019 (which was 10,435,719 tons) and was equivalent to 16.84% of world production of orange in the same year (78,699,604 tons). Most of it is destined for the industrialization and export of juice.

In 2017, São Paulo represented 9.8% of the total national production of coffee (third place).

The state of São Paulo concentrates more than 90% of the national production of peanuts, and Brazil exports around 30% of the peanuts it produces.

São Paulo is also the largest national producer of banana, with 1 million tons in 2018. The country produced 6.7 million tons this year. Brazil was already the 2nd largest producer of the fruit in the world, currently in 3rd place, losing only to India and Ecuador.

The cultivation of soy, on the other hand, is increasing, however, it is not among the largest national producers of this grain. In the 2018–2019 harvest, São Paulo harvested 3 million tons (Brazil produced 120 million).

São Paulo also has a considerable production of maize (corn). In 2019, it produced almost 2 million tons. It is the sixth largest producer of this grain in Brazil. State demand is estimated at 9 million tons, for animal feed, which requires the State of São Paulo to buy corn from other units of the Federation.

In the production of cassava, Brazil produced a total of 17.6 million tons in 2018. São Paulo was the third largest producer in the country, with 1.1 million tons.

In 2018, São Paulo was the largest producer of tangerines in Brazil. About persimmons, São Paulo is the largest producer in the country with 58%. The Southeast is the largest producer of lemons in the country, with 86% of the total obtained in 2018. Only the state of São Paulo produces 79% of the total.

In 2019, in Brazil, there was a total production area of around 4 thousand hectares of strawberries. São Paulo ranked second in Brazil with 800 hectares, with production concentrated in the municipalities of Piedade, Campinas, Jundiaí, Atibaia and nearby municipalities.

With regard to carrots, Brazil ranked fifth in the world ranking in 2016, with an annual production of around 760 thousand tons. In relation to the exports of this product, Brazil occupies the seventh world position. Minas Gerais and São Paulo are the 2 largest producers in Brazil. In São Paulo, the producing municipalities are Piedade, Ibiúna and Mogi das Cruzes. As for potatoes, the main national producer is the state of Minas Gerais, with 32% of the total produced in the country. In 2017, Minas Gerais harvested around 1.3 million tons of the product. São Paulo owns 24% of the production.

Regarding the bovine herd, in 2019 São Paulo had approximately 10.3 million head of cattle (6.1 million for beef, 1 million for milk production, 3 million for both). The production of milk this year was 1.78 billion liters. The number of birds to lay eggs was 56.49 million heads. Production of eggs was 1.34 billion dozen. The State of São Paulo is the largest national producer with 29.4%. In the production of poultry for production in São Paulo, there was a production of 690.96 million heads in 2019, equivalent to an offer of 1.57 million tons of chicken. The number of pigs in the state in 2019 is 929.62 thousand heads. Production was 1.46 million head, or 126 thousand tons of pork.

In 2018, when it comes to chickens, the first ranking region was the Southeast, with 38.9% of the total head of the country. A total of 246.9 million chickens were estimated for 2018. The state of São Paulo was responsible for 21.9%. The national production of chicken eggs was 4.4 billion dozen in 2018. The Southeast region was responsible for 43.8% of the total produced. The state of São Paulo was the largest national producer (25.6%). The number of quail was 16.8 million birds. The Southeast is responsible for 64%, highlighting São Paulo (24.6%).

=== Secondary sector ===
Regarding industry, São Paulo had an industrial GDP of R $378.7 billion in 2017, equivalent to 31.6% of the national industry and employed 2,859,258 workers in the industry. The main industrial sectors are: construction (18.7%), food (12.7%), chemical products (8.4%), industrial services for public services, such as electricity and water (7.9%), and motor vehicles (7.0%). These 5 sectors concentrate 54.7% of the state&#x27;s industry.

In 2019, Rio de Janeiro was the largest producer of oil and natural gas in Brazil, with 71% of the total volume produced. São Paulo is in second place, with an 11.5% share in total production.

In Brazil, the automotive sector represents about 22% of industrial GDP. ABC Paulista is the first center and largest automobile center in Brazil. When the country&#x27;s manufacturing was practically restricted to ABC, the State represented 74.8% of Brazilian production in 1990. In 2017, this index decreased to 46.6%, and in 2019, to 40.1%, due to a phenomenon of internalization of vehicle production in Brazil, driven by factors such as unions, which made payroll and labor burdens excessively burdensome, discouraged investment, and favored the search for new cities. The development of ABC cities has also helped curb the appeal, due to rising real estate costs and a higher density of residential areas. São Paulo has factories of GM, Volkswagen, Ford, Honda, Toyota, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, Scania and Caoa.

In the production of tractors, in 2017, the main manufacturers in Brazil were John Deere, New Holland, Massey Ferguson, Valtra, Case IH and the Brazilian Agrale. They all have factories in the southeast, basically in São Paulo.

In the steel industry, Brazilian crude steel production was 32.2 million tons in 2019. Minas Gerais represented 32.3% of the volume produced in the period, with 10,408 million tons. The other largest steel centers in Brazil in 2019 were: Rio de Janeiro (8,531 million tons), Espírito Santo (6,478 million tons) and São Paulo (2,272 million tons). Some steel manufacturers in São Paulo are COSIPA (owned by Usiminas), Aços Villares and Gerdau, which has factories in Mogi das Cruzes and Pindamonhangaba, which produce special steel, and Araçariguama, which produces long steel for civil construction.

In 2011, Brazil had the sixth largest chemical industry in the world, with net sales of US$157 billion, or 3.1% of world sales. At that time, there were 973 chemical factories for industrial use. They are concentrated in the Southeast Region, mainly in São Paulo. The chemical industry contributed 2.7% to the Brazilian GDP in 2012 and was established as the fourth largest sector in the manufacturing industry. Despite registering one of the largest sales in the sector in the world, the Brazilian chemical industry, in 2012 and 2013, experienced a strong transfer of production abroad, with a drop in national industrial production and an increase in imports. A third of consumption in the country was supplied by imports. 448 products stopped being manufactured in Brazil between 1990 and 2012. This led to the interruption of 1,710 production lines. In 1990, the share of imported products in Brazilian consumption was only 7%, in 2012 it was 30%. The main companies in the sector in Brazil are: Braskem, BASF, Bayer, among others. In 2018, the Brazilian chemical sector was the eighth largest in the world, representing 10% of national industrial GDP and 2.5% of total GDP. In 2020, imports will occupy 43% of the internal demand for chemical products. Since 2008, the average use of capacity in the Brazilian chemical industry has been at a level considered low, ranging from 70 to 83%.

In Food Industry, in 2019, Brazil was the second largest exporter of processed foods in the world, with a value of U $34.1 billion in exports. The income of the Brazilian food and beverage industry in 2019 was R $699.9 billion, 9.7% of the country&#x27;s Gross Domestic Product. In 2015, the food and beverage industry in Brazil comprised 34,800 companies (not including bakeries), the vast majority of which were small. These companies employed more than 1,600,000 workers, making the food and beverage industry the largest employer in the manufacturing industry. There are around 570 large companies in Brazil, which concentrate a good part of the total industry income. São Paulo created companies such as: Yoki, Vigor, Minerva Foods, Bauducco, Santa Helena, Marilan, Ceratti, Fugini, Chocolates Pan, Embaré, among others.

In the Pharmaceutical Industry, most companies in Brazil have been established in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro for a long time. In 2019, the situation was that, due to the tax advantages offered in states like Pernambuco, Goiás and Minas Gerais, companies left RJ and SP and went to these states. In 2017, Brazil was considered the sixth largest pharmaceutical market in the world. Drug sales in pharmacies reached around R $57 billion (US$17.79 billion) in the country. The pharmaceutical market in Brazil had 241 regularized and authorized laboratories for the sale of medicines. Of these, the majority (60%) have national capital. Multinational companies had approximately 52.44% of the market, with 34.75% in commercialized packaging. Brazilian laboratories represent 47.56% of the market in sales and 65.25% in boxes sold. In the distribution of medicine sales by state, São Paulo ranked first: São Paulo&#x27;s pharmaceutical industry had a turnover of R $53.3 billion, 76.8% of total sales across the country. The companies that benefited the most from the sale of medicines in the country in 2015 were EMS, Hypermarcas (NeoQuímica), Sanofi (Medley), Novartis, Aché, Eurofarma, Takeda, Bayer, Pfizer and GSK.

In the footwear industry, in 2019 Brazil produced 972 million pairs. Exports were around 10%, reaching almost 125 million pairs. Brazil ranks fourth among world producers, behind China, India and Vietnam, and 11th among the largest exporters. Of the pairs produced, 49% were made of plastic or rubber, 28.8% were made of synthetic laminate, and only 17.7% were made of leather. The largest polo in Brazil is located in Rio Grande do Sul, but São Paulo has important shoe centers, such as the one in the city of Franca, specialized in men&#x27;s footwear, in the city of Jaú, specialized in women&#x27;s footwear and in the city of Birigui, specialized in children&#x27;s footwear. Jaú, Franca and Birigui represent 92% of footwear production in the state of São Paulo. Birigui has 350 companies, which generate around 13 thousand jobs, producing 45.9 million pairs per year. 52% of children&#x27;s shoes in the country are produced in this city. From Birigui came the majority of the most famous children&#x27;s shoe factories in the country. Jaú has 150 factories that produce around 130 thousand pairs of cheap women&#x27;s shoes per day. The footwear sector in Franca has around 550 companies and employs around 20,000 employees. Most of the country&#x27;s most famous men&#x27;s shoe factories come from São Paulo. Overall, however, the Brazilian industry has been struggling to compete with Chinese footwear, which has an unbeatable price due to the difference in tax collection from one country to another, in addition to the absence of strong Brazilian labor taxes in China. Brazilian businessmen have had to invest in value-added products, combining quality and design, in order to survive.

In the textile industry, Brazil, despite being among the 5 largest producers in the world in 2013, and being representative in the consumption of textiles and clothing, has very little insertion in world trade. In 2015, Brazilian imports ranked 25th (US$5.5 billion). And in exports, it was only 40th in the world ranking. Brazil&#x27;s share of world textile and clothing trade is only 0.3%, due to the difficulty of competing in price with producers from India and mainly from China. The gross value of production, which includes the consumption of intermediate goods and services, of the Brazilian textile industry corresponded to almost R $40 billion in 2015, 1.6% of the gross value of industrial production in Brazil. São Paulo (37.4%) is the largest producer. The main productive areas of São Paulo are the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo and Campinas.

In Electronics industry, the billing of industries in Brazil reached R $153.0 billion in 2019, about 3% of national GDP. The number of employees in the sector was 234.5 thousand people. Exports were $5.6 billion, and the country&#x27;s imports were $32.0 billion. Brazil, despite decades-long efforts to rid itself of dependence on technology imports, has yet to reach this level. Imports are concentrated on expensive components such as processors, microcontrollers, memories, magnetic disks, lasers, LEDs and LCDs mounted below. The cables for telecommunications and electricity distribution, cables, optical fibers and connectors are manufactured in the country. Brazil has two large centers for the production of electronic products, located in the Metropolitan Region of Campinas, in the State of São Paulo, and in the Free Trade Zone of Manaus, in the State of Amazonas. There are large, internationally renowned technology companies as well as part of the industries that participate in its supply chain. The country also has other smaller centers, such as the municipalities of São José dos Campos and São Carlos, in the state of São Paulo. In Campinas there are industrial units of groups such as General Electric, Samsung, HP and Foxconn, a manufacturer of Apple and Dell products. São José dos Campos, focuses on the aviation industry. This is where the headquarters of Embraer is located, a Brazilian company that is the third largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, after Boeing and Airbus. In the production of cell phones and other electronic products, Samsung produces in Campinas; LG produces in Taubaté; Flextronics, which produces Motorola cell phones, produces in Jaguariúna; and Semp-TCL produces in Cajamar.
In the household appliances industry, sales were 12.9 million units in 2017. The sector had its peak in sales in 2012, with 18.9 million units. The brands that sold the most were Brastemp, Electrolux, Consul and Philips. Brastemp is originally from São Bernardo do Campo. São Paulo was also the place where Metalfrio was founded.

Several famous multinationals have factories in São Paulo, such as Coca-Cola, Nestlé, PepsiCo, Ambev, Procter &amp; Gamble and Unilever.

=== Tertiary sector ===

The tertiary sector is the largest and most relevant sector of São Paulo&#x27;s economy: in 2011, the share of services represented 70.46% of the total value added to the economy of the entire state.

According to the Map of Companies, from the Ministry of Development, Industry, Trade and Services (MDIC), there were 5,994,192 companies in the state (2023), and 17,047,181 workers worked for all these companies, with a general average salary of more than 3 minimum wages.

In São Paulo, in 2023, there were 5,193 agencies (financial institutions), which yielded 2,464,955,652,102 thousand reais in credit operations, 130,091,336,437 thousand reais in government demand deposits, 325,739,438,658 thousand reais in savings, 1,029,348,681,505 thousand reais in time deposits and 1,472,186,852 thousand reais in obligations to receive.

== Tourism ==

Tourism in the state of São Paulo is a large sector that serves millions of national and international tourists, representing 10% of its GDP, and stands out for being the main and most developed tourist hub in the country, its capital, São Paulo, is often the Brazilian city most sought after by national and foreign tourists, one of the ten most visited destinations in Latin America and the Caribbean and one of the 50 most visited cities on the planet, according to a Mastercard study. The state — the largest sending and receiving market (47 million) of tourists in the country — has multiple sites inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List and features cities or places of high cultural interest, offers various historical sites and attractions, monuments, museums and theaters, architecture, leisure, events, entertainment, business, natural beauty, diverse climate, rich culture and gastronomy, coastline with several beaches and caiçara culture, interior with numerous parks, canyons, abundance of water, rivers, waterfalls, swimming pools and natural reserves, thermal waters, ecotourism and tourist resorts, as well as rural and mountainous regions (where astrotourism is famous, and it is possible to see the Milky Way) that many appreciate for their beauty and tranquility, with typical caipira cuisine and culture, the which attracts visitors from different parts of the world.

Historical records about São Paulo&#x27;s tourism date back to the 17th century, in the well-known travel reports about the territory of Brazil, which were made by explorers and travelers who examined new lands. However, the first known work written specifically about the São Paulo Province is &quot;The trip to São Paulo in the summer of 1813&quot; (&quot;A viagem de São Paulo do verão de 1813&quot;), by Gustavo Beyer; there, the author noted that &quot;the Captaincy of São Paulo was considered a paradise in Brazil because of its altitude, its healthy and fresh air and its hospitable inhabitants&quot;. After this publication, many others of the genre appeared, such as the watercolor &quot;The Navel of São Paulo&quot; (1827), by Jean-Baptiste Debret, and works and/or reports by Augustin Saint-Hilaire (1819), Hércules Florence (1826) and Daniel Kidder (1837). During the 19th century, the movement of people within the national territory grew with the advent of new means of transport, mainly rail, and it was in the 20th century that São Paulo emerged as the main entry point for people in Brazil from different parts of the world due to its large supply of work, hotels, transport, leisure, entertainment and culture, as well as cities with a high quality of life, which was reflected (and still is reflected in the 21st century) in the large numbers of tourists. The capital was the scene of many of the country&#x27;s main historical events. In the state, there are numerous cities, monuments and buildings listed by CONDEPHAAT, CONPRESP and IPHAN due to their importance as state and national historical heritage, as well as sites considered World Heritage and natural areas declared Biosphere Reserves of the Planet by UNESCO.

São Paulo has three tourism hubs: the capital, the coast and the interior. Known worldwide as the economic, financial and cultural center of Latin America and the &quot;city that never sleeps&quot;, São Paulo city offers diverse tourism options, from business (which provides the city with around 45 thousand events per year, being the most visited city in the country) and shopping tourism to leisure tourism in Ibirapuera Park, for example, and ecotourism in waterfalls and conservation units considered World Heritage in Brazil. The south of the capital provides agroecology and sustainable tourism at the Ecotourism Hub of the Municipality of São Paulo. It also contains numerous museums that are among the best in the world, notably the São Paulo Museum of Art (MASP), and several restaurants that are also among the best, being one of the ten main gastronomic destinations on the planet (2022) and recognized as the &quot;World Capital of Gastronomy&quot;. Furthermore, cultural tourism and events are highly sought after in famous theaters and cultural spaces, such as the Theatro Municipal, Pinacoteca, Memorial da América Latina, São Paulo Art Biennial, and São Paulo Fashion Week. Regarding historical and architectural tourism, the highlights include the Historic Center, Pátio do Colégio, Municipal Market, Luz Station, and iconic buildings and monuments in the country&#x27;s history, such as Altino Arantes, Copan, Itália, Martinelli, Mirante do Vale, Hotel Unique, Conjunto Nacional, Octávio Frias de Oliveira Bridge, Catedral da Sé, Obelisk of São Paulo, Marco Zero, and Monumento do Ipiranga. In terms of sports, there are events at the Interlagos Circuit and the Morumbi, Neo Química Arena, and Pacaembu stadiums. LGBT tourism is also known in the capital, with the São Paulo LGBT Pride Parade being the largest in the world. São Paulo also has the largest Brazilian hotel chain.

In the interior of the state, there are also the most varied programs. It is known for its tourist resorts, municipalities that receive financial subsidies from the state government with the aim of promoting and encouraging tourism activities. These resorts are divided into four groups: tourist (32), spas (15), climate (12) and hydromineral (11). The interior is sought after for its climate — in cities such as Campos do Jordão, in winter, the city emerges as the main tourist reference state, with the Winter Festival and several other attractions in an environment where the temperature can drop down below 0 (zero) degrees (Celsius); Atibaia, Bragança Paulista, Santo Antônio do Pinhal, and São Bento do Sapucaí —, and also for offering diverse options for ecotourism, trails, adventure tourism and caving, mainly due to the fact that the state is home to 30% of the entire country&#x27;s Atlantic Forest, with emphasis on the Alto Ribeira Tourist State Park (PETAR), Serra do Mar State Park and Southeast Atlantic Forest Reserves (World Heritage Site).

The interior also attracts tourists due to its parks with natural thermal waters and therapeutic properties in Águas de Lindóia, Águas de Santa Bárbara, Águas de São Pedro, Barretos, Ibirá, Lins and Olímpia (these cities are some of those considered &quot;hydromineral resorts&quot;), and amusement parks, including Hopi Hari, a major theme park in Brazil, in the Metropolitan Region of Campinas; Hot Beach and Thermas dos Laranjais, the most visited water park in Latin America and the fifth in the world (both located in Olímpia); Wet’n Wild, and Thermas Water Park. Hydrotourism in the &quot;Circuito das Águas&quot; (Water Circuit, regions where hydromineral resorts are located) is very popular, as well as enotourism in São Roque and São Miguel Arcanjo. Cities such as Piracicaba, Boituva, Sorocaba and Rio Claro are world famous for ballooning.

Rural destinations are among the most sought after by travelers visiting the state. With more than 1,200 registered rural properties and 10 gastronomic routes mapped across the state, São Paulo has become one of the main tourist destinations in the world. Furthermore, rural tourism and caipira culture, folklore and typical festivals are also part of the attractions of the interior, as well as historical buildings from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. Religious tourism is another sector that attracts people from different parts of the world, with the Basilica of Our Lady of Aparecida (Aparecida, the most important city for religious tourism in Brazil) and the Temple of Solomon (São Paulo) being widely visited.

The coastline of São Paulo state along the South Atlantic Ocean is the 5th longest in the country and, along its 622 km, has beaches and leisure options in the most diverse styles, being a national precursor of mass sun and beach tourism, with cities such as Guarujá, Ilhabela, Praia Grande, Santos, Ubatuba being some of the most desired in the country. Among the paradisiacal and most visited beaches in the state and which are often listed among the most beautiful and/or best in Brazil and the world (with Blue Flag certification), there are: Praia do Tombo, Praia Almada, Brava, Praia do Bonete, Calhetas, Camburi, Castelhanos, Cedro, Guaratuba, Enseada, Fazenda, Mococa, Pernambuco, Picinguaba, Barra do Sahy, Barra do Una, Juqueí, Ilha das Couves and Riviera de São Lourenço. Historical tourism is also very popular both on the coast and in the rest of the state due to its historical importance for the country, especially in Cananeia (considered one of the largest marine life nurseries on the planet), Itanhaém, Iguape, Paranapiacaba, Santana de Parnaíba, São Luiz do Paraitinga, São Vicente (the first village in Brazil), and Santos. On Ilha Comprida, declared a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO, it is possible to find both natural reserves and dunes, the last in the state, in the Ilha Comprida Environmental Protection Area.

=== Historic sites ===
One of the most culturally and historically rich states in the country, São Paulo has several monuments and buildings listed by Condephaat and IPHAN.

Sertanista House, Casa do Sítio da Ressaca, Casa do Sítio Tatuapé, Sítio Morrinhos, Solar da Marquesa de Santos. Engenho dos Erasmos, Butantã&#x27;s House.

==Infrastructure==
=== Transport ===
The state of São Paulo has the most modern large-scale infrastructure in the country, being the only one equivalent to developed countries and the only one that, consequently, is capable of providing industrial diversity. Its road system is the largest among the federative units in Brazil. In November 2021, the state had, between federal, municipal and state highways, a network of 199,975 km (176,675 km municipal, 22,219 km state and 1,075 km federal) with 34,753 km paved, and of these, 6,346 km are double lane highways (2 lanes or more of traffic in each direction). With 654 km, the Rodovia Raposo Tavares (SP-270) is the longest highway in the state and connects the capital, where it begins in Butantã, to the west of São Paulo, extending to the border with Mato Grosso do Sul in Presidente Epitácio.

São Paulo&#x27;s highways are considered the most modern and, compared to other Brazilian highways, the best in the country in terms of general state of conservation. The administration of some of them was transferred to the private sector from the end of the 1990s, within a broader privatization program. The winning companies in the bidding process were forced to make a series of investments and meet quality targets, but, despite the improvement in accident statistics, the charging of a toll considered high by Brazilian standards provokes criticism of the privatization model.

The original airport&#x27;s two terminals are designed to handle 20.5 million passengers a year, but the recently opened third terminal expanded the capacity for 42 million users.São Paulo International Airport is also one of the main air cargo hubs in Brazil. The roughly 100 cargo flights a day carry everything from fruits grown in the São Francisco Valley to medications.

Congonhas-São Paulo Airport or just Congonhas Airport is one of São Paulo&#x27;s three commercial airports, situated 8 kilometres (5 miles) from the city downtown at Washington Luís Avenue, in the Campo Belo district. It is owned by the City of São Paulo and managed by Infraero. In 2013, it was the busiest airport in Brazil in terms of aircraft movements and the second busiest in terms of passengers, handling 209,555 aircraft movements and 17,119,530 passengers.

Located 14 kilometers from downtown Campinas and 99 kilometers from the city of São Paulo, Viracopos-Campinas International Airport can be reached by three highways: Santos Dumont, Bandeirantes and Anhanguera. The city of Campinas is one of Brazil&#x27;s leaders in technology. Besides excellent highway connections, it is the location of major universities and many high-tech companies. Because of this, the airport is one of Infraero&#x27;s highest investment priorities. The old &quot;landing field&quot; as it was called has become one of the main connection points in Latin America.

The air cargo import/export terminal of Campinas has an area of over 81,000 square meters. The airport began to concentrate in the international air cargo sector in the 1990s and today this is the airports leading source of revenue. Since 1995, Infraero has been investing to implement the first phase of the airport&#x27;s master plan, making major improvements to the cargo and passenger terminals. The first phase was completed in the first half of 2004, when the airport received new departure and arrival lounges, public areas and commercial concessions. In 2012, the airport received a new terminal, it has since been privatized.

====Railways====

In rail transport, the state has more than of railways, which comes from the banks of the Parana River on the border of São Paulo and Mato Grosso do Sul, to the Port of Santos, on the Atlantic coast, for the carriage of goods.

It consists of four color-coded lines: Line 1-Blue, Line 2-Green, Line 3-Red and Line 5-Lilac; Line 4-Yellow started to work in May 2010, and will be completed only in 2016.

The metro system carries 2.8 million passengers a day. Metro itself is far from covering the entire urban area in the city of São Paulo. Another company, Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos (CPTM), [&quot;São Paulo Metropolitan Train Company&quot;] works along with the metro system and runs additional commuter railways converted into light rail service lines, which total six lines (numbers 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12), 261 km long, serving 89 stations. Metro and CPTM are integrated through various stations.

Paulo&quot;, the cost of tolls to travel the coastal path of of the federal highway BR-101, which connect Rio Grande do Norte to Rio Grande do Sul, is cheaper than to go through the of highways separating the municipalities of São Paulo and Ribeirão Preto.

<doc id="229428" wikidata="Q928424" url="?curid=229428" title="Barth syndrome">
<text>Barth syndrome (BTHS) is a rare but serious X-linked genetic disorder, caused by changes in phospholipid structure and metabolism. It may affect multiple body systems (though mainly characterized by pronounced pediatric-onset cardiomyopathy), and is potentially fatal. The syndrome is diagnosed almost exclusively in males.

==Presentation==
Though not always present, the cardinal characteristics of this multi-system disorder include: cardiomyopathy (dilated or hypertrophic, possibly with left ventricular noncompaction and/or endocardial fibroelastosis), neutropenia (chronic, cyclic, or intermittent), underdeveloped skeletal musculature and muscle weakness, growth delay, exercise intolerance, cardiolipin abnormalities, and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria.
It can be associated with stillbirth.

Barth Syndrome is manifested in a variety of ways at birth. A majority of patients are hypotonic at birth; show signs of cardiomyopathy within the first few months of life; and experience a deceleration in growth in the first year, despite adequate nutrition. As patients progress into childhood, their height and weight lag significantly behind average. While most patients express normal intelligence, a significant proportion of patients also express mild or moderate learning disabilities. Physical activity is also hindered due to diminished muscular development and muscular hypotonia. Many of these disorders are resolved after puberty. Growth accelerates during puberty, and many patients reach a normal adult height.

Cardiomyopathy is one of the more severe manifestations of Barth Syndrome. The myocardium is dilated, reducing the systolic pump of the ventricles. For this reason, most patients have left myocardial thickening (hypertrophy). While cardiomyopathy can be life-threatening, it is commonly resolved or substantially improved in Barth Syndrome patients after puberty.

Neutropenia, a granulocyte disorder that results in a low production of neutrophils, the body&#x27;s primary defenders against bacterial infections, is another severe manifestation of Barth Syndrome. In general, lower levels of neutrophils render a patient more vulnerable to bacterial infections; in Barth Syndrome patients, however, there are reports of relatively fewer bacterial infections as compared to non-Barth patients with neutropenia.

==Cause==
The tafazzin gene (&quot;TAZ&quot;, also called G4.5 or NG_009634) is highly expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle; its gene product, Taz1p, functions as an acyltransferase in complex lipid metabolism. Any type of mutation of TAZ (missense, nonsense, deletion, frameshift, and/or splicing) is closely associated with Barth syndrome.

In 2008, Dr. Kulik found that every patient with Barth Syndrome that he tested had abnormalities in their cardiolipin, a lipid found inside the mitochondria of cells. Cardiolipin is intimately connected with the electron transport chain proteins and the membrane structure of the mitochondrion, the energy-producing organelle of the cell. iPLA2-VIA has been suggested as a target for treatment.

The human tafazzin gene is over 10,000 base pairs in length, the full-length mRNA, NM_000116, being 1919 nucleotides long, encoding 11 exons with a predicted protein length of 292 amino acids and a molecular weight of 33.5 kDa. It is located at Xq28; the long arm of the X chromosome. This explains the X-linked nature of Barth Syndrome.

There are some case reports of women who are asymptomatic carriers of the TAZ mutation. Any of their children might inherit the modified gene with a 50% probability, with the males developing Barth Syndrome and the females going on to be carriers themselves. Thus, it is vitally important to take familial histories of Barth Syndrome patients to determine genetic risk. Ideally, any male who is matrilineally related to an individual with Barth Syndrome should be tested for TAZ mutation(s). Because the phenotype can vary widely, even among affected siblings, symptomatology (or lack thereof) by itself is insufficient for diagnosis.

== Diagnosis ==
Early diagnosis of the syndrome is complicated, but of critical importance. Clinical presentation in Barth Syndrome is highly variable, with the only common denominator being early-onset and pronounced cardiomyopathy. Diagnosis is established based upon several tests, among which can be blood tests (neutropenia, white blood cell count), urinalysis (increased urinary organic acid levels), echocardiography (cardiac ultrasound, to assess (and detect abnormalities in) the heart&#x27;s structure, function and condition), and, with reasonable suspicion of Barth Syndrome, DNA sequencing (to verify TAZ gene status).

=== Differential diagnosis ===
Based on symptoms at time of presentation, the differential diagnosis may include other hereditary and/or nutritional causes of (dilated) cardiomyopathy and (cyclic or idiopathic) neutropenia.

==Treatment==
Currently, there is no treatment for Barth syndrome, although some of the symptoms can be successfully managed. Clinical trials for possible treatments are ongoing, and preliminary research into AAV9-mediated &quot;TAZ&quot; gene replacement by the University of Florida has been promising. However, more research and (pre-)clinical testing is needed before the gene therapy is eligible for approval by the FDA as a treatment modality. In the fall of 2024 the Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee voted 10-6 that elamipretide is effective for this rare disease caused by TAFAZZIN gene mutations. Elamipretide is proposed as a first-in-class mitochondrial protective agent that theoretically improves the function of cardiolipin-deficient mitochondria in patients with Barth syndrome.
==Epidemiology==
Being X-linked, Barth syndrome has been predominantly diagnosed in males (as of July 2009: 120+ males), although by 2012 a female case had been reported.

The syndrome is believed to be severely under-reported due to the complexity of (early) diagnosis. Reports on its incidence and prevalence in the international literature vary; around 1 in every 454,000 individuals are thought to suffer from Barth Syndrome. Incidence has been estimated at anywhere between 1:140,000 (South West England, South Wales) and 1:300,000 - 1:400,000 live births (United States). Geographical distribution is homogenous, with patients (and their family members) on every continent (with known cases in, for example, the US, Canada, Europe, Japan, South Africa, Kuwait, and Australia).

==History==
The syndrome was named for Dr. Peter Barth (b. 1932), a Dutch pediatric neurologist, for his research into and the discovery of the syndrome in 1983. He described a pedigree chart, showing that this is an inherited trait and not a &#x27;communicated&#x27; (i.e. infectious) disease.

<doc id="229431" wikidata="Q642481" url="?curid=229431" title="Saint Croix">
<text>Saint Croix ( ; ; ; ; Danish and ; ) is an island in the Caribbean Sea, and a county and constituent district of the United States Virgin Islands (USVI), an unincorporated territory of the United States.

St. Croix is the largest of the territory&#x27;s islands. As of the 2020 U.S. census, its population was 41,004. The island&#x27;s highest point is Mount Eagle, at . St. Croix&#x27;s nickname is &quot;Twin City&quot;, for its two towns, Frederiksted on the western end and Christiansted on the northeast part of the island.

==Name==
The island&#x27;s indigenous Taino name is &quot;Ay Ay&quot; (&quot;the river&quot;). Its indigenous Carib name is &quot;Cibuquiera&quot; (&quot;the stony land&quot;). Its modern name, &quot;Saint Croix&quot;, is derived from the French &quot;Sainte-Croix&quot;, itself a translation of the Spanish name &quot;Isla de la Santa Cruz&quot; (meaning &quot;island of the Holy Cross&quot;) given by Christopher Columbus in 1493. The French name was partially retained under Danish rule as &quot;Sankt Croix&quot;, and the island was given its current spelling after the U.S. takeover in 1917. The associated demonym for the island is Crucian, derived from the original Spanish name.

==History==


Igneri pottery indicates human presence on the island from 1–700 CE, followed by the Taíno from 700–1425, before the encroachment by the Caribs in 1425; the island was uninhabited by 1590.

Various indigenous groups inhabited the island during its prehistory. Columbus landed on Santa Cruz, as he called it, on 14 November 1493, and was immediately attacked by the Kalinago, who lived at Salt River on the north shore. This is the first recorded fight between the Spanish and a New World native population, and Columbus gave the battle site the name &quot;Cabo de la Flecha&quot; (Cape of the Arrow). The Spanish never colonized the Islands, but most or all of the native population was eventually dispersed or killed. By the end of the 16th century, the islands were said to be uninhabited.

===Colonial period===
Dutch and English settlers landed at Saint Croix in 1625, joined by some French refugees from Saint Kitts. The English expelled the Dutch and French settlers before they themselves were evicted by a Spanish invasion from Puerto Rico in August 1650. Around 1650, a French force attacked and established a colony of 300. From 1651 until 1664, the Knights of Malta (at the time a vassal state of the Kingdom of Sicily) ruled the island in the name of Louis XIV. The island then passed to the French West India Company. The colony was evacuated to Saint-Domingue in 1695, when France battled the English and Dutch in the War of the Grand Alliance. The island was then uninhabited and abandoned for another 38 years.

In 1725, St. Thomas Governor Frederik Moth encouraged the Danish West Indies Company&#x27;s directors to consider purchasing Santa Cruz (St. Croix). On 15 June 1733, France and Denmark-Norway concluded a treaty by which the Danish West India Company bought St. Croix for 750,000 livres. Louis XV ratified the treaty on 28 June 1733 and received half the payment in French coins, with the remaining half paid in 18 months. On 16 November 1733, Moth was named St. Croix&#x27;s first Danish governor. The 1742 census lists 120 sugar plantations, 122 cotton plantations, 1,906 slaves, and 360 whites. By 1754, slaves numbered 7,566. That year, King Frederick took direct control of St. Croix from the company.

For nearly 200 years, St. Croix, St. Thomas, and St. John were the Danish West Indies. By the mid- to late 18th century, the peak of the plantation economy, St. Croix&#x27;s enslaved population numbered between 18,000 and 20,000. The white population during this time ranged between 1,500 and 2,000.

Future American revolutionary leader Alexander Hamilton and his brother lived in Christiansted with their mother, Rachel Faucette, on St. Croix after she returned to the island in 1765. Their residence was in the upper floor of a house at 34 Company Street, while Rachel used the lower floor as a shop selling food items. Within two years, Hamilton lost his father, James Hamilton, by abandonment, and his mother to death. Official documents from the island, a 1768 probate court testimony from his uncle, established Alexander&#x27;s age at 13. By 1769, Hamilton&#x27;s cousin, aunt, uncle, and grandmother had also died. Alexander’s brother James became an apprentice carpenter and Alexander became the ward of Thomas Stevens, a merchant on King Street. Hamilton was soon clerking in the export-import business of Beekman and Cruger at the intersection of King and King&#x27;s Cross Streets. In 1772 a local businessmen funded Hamilton&#x27;s further education in New York.

The slave trade was abolished in the Danish colonies in 1792, although the prohibition did not go into effect until 1802. Existing enslaved people were freed in 1848, after the 1848 St. Croix Slave Revolt, led by General &quot;Buddhoe&quot; Gottlieb.

The British occupied the Danish West Indies in March 1801, with the arrival of a British fleet at St. Thomas. Denmark-Norway accepted the Articles of Capitulation and the British occupied the islands without a shot being fired. The occupation lasted until April 1802, when Britain returned the islands to Denmark-Norway.

The British invaded the Danish West Indies again in December 1807. A British fleet captured St. Thomas on 22 December and St. Croix on 25 December. Denmark-Norway did not resist and the invasion again was bloodless. This occupation lasted until 20 November 1815. Both invasions were due to Denmark&#x27;s alliance with France during the Napoleonic Wars. Upon the conclusion of a peace with France, the islands were returned to Denmark.

===As a United States territory===
The 1878 St. Croix labor riot shook the island. In 1916, Denmark sold St. Croix, St. Thomas, and St. John to the U.S., formalizing the transfer in the Treaty of the Danish West Indies, in exchange for $25 million in gold. In a national referendum on the issue, 64.2% of Danish voters approved the sale. In an unofficial referendum held in the islands, 99.83% voted in favor of the purchase. Formal transfer of the islands to the U.S. took place on 1 April 1917.

St. Croix&#x27;s inhabitants were granted U.S. citizenship in 1927. The island industrialized and moved away from an agrarian society in the 1960s. The 1972 Fountain Valley massacre, a mass shooting during a robbery at a golf club, led to a devastating reduction in tourism that lasted many years. In 1989, Hurricane Hugo struck the island with Category 4 winds. The United States Army, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United States Marshals Service were brought in to restore order.

The 2012 shutdown of the Hovensa refinery resulted in the loss of many jobs. Agriculture has seen a slow resurgence, due to an increase in demand for local produce and agricultural products. Category 5 Hurricane Maria&#x27;s weaker outer eyewall crossed St. Croix in 2017; sustained winds reached over 150 mph and gusted up to 250 mph in some places on the island&#x27;s western end. Maria damaged or destroyed 70% of St. Croix&#x27;s buildings, including schools and the only hospital.

==Geography==
Saint Croix lies at . On the eastern tip of the island, Point Udall is the easternmost point (by travel, not longitude) of the United States including insular areas. The island&#x27;s highest point, Mount Eagle, is high. Most of the east end is quite hilly and steep, as is the north side from Christiansted west. From the north-side hills, a fairly even plain slopes down to the south coast; this was cultivated as the island&#x27;s prime sugar land. 

The island has a land area of , making it the largest island of the U.S. Virgin Islands. It has rugged terrain with diverse ecosystems, including subtropical rainforests, coastal plains, shrublands, rocky hills, valleys, and beaches, and as well as coral reefs off the coast.

In 2023, St. Croix was designated a National Heritage Area -- the first National Heritage Area to be located in a U.S. Territory.

==Climate==

St. Croix has a tropic to semi-arid climate. Trade winds blow along the length of the island year round. The temperature ranges from the mid-70s to high 80s Fahrenheit (mid-20s to low 30s Celsius), with an average temperature of 80.2°F (26.8°C). Average annual rainfall is around per year, but rainfall varies by season and location on the island. 

The hills of the western part of the island receive a good deal more rain than the east end, with annual rainfall ranging from 50 inches per year in the northwest to 25-38 inches per year in the east. The west end has lush vegetation and palm trees, while the east end of the island is a dry desert range with a substantial amount of cactus. 

August to November is the wet season in the U.S. Virgin Islands, with the remainder of the year as the dry season. About 40% of the annual rainfall usually occurs from September to November. During the dry season, fairly severe and extended drought can be a problem for the island, particularly considering the scarcity of freshwater in the U.S. Virgin Islands. St. Croix has a desalination plant, but most residential homes and businesses have built-in cisterns used to collect rainwater. 

==Demographics==
Inhabitants are called Crucians (frequently written as &quot;Cruzans&quot;).

Due to St. Croix&#x27;s history of immigration, there is much debate as to what constitutes a native Crucian. The consensus in Crucian society is anyone &quot;bahn ya&quot; (&quot;born here&quot; in Crucian dialect) on St. Croix can claim to be Crucian, but not necessarily a &quot;native Crucian&quot;. People considered &quot;native Crucians&quot;, or &quot;ancestral native Crucian&quot;s, are those who can trace their ancestry to the era before Crucians were granted U.S. citizenship in 1927. Ancestral native Crucians (one-fourth to one-third of St. Croix&#x27;s population) largely consist of the descendants of enslaved Africans brought to the island by Europeans during the 18th and 19th centuries and the descendants of paid laborers the Danes recruited from the British and Dutch West Indies after the Danish emancipation law in 1848. As on other Caribbean islands, many ancestral natives are also descended from European settlers and planters who migrated to the West Indies during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Due to a low number of European women in the colonial West Indies, many European men in colonial St. Croix had children with the majority African population, whose mixed-heritage descendants bear their European ancestors&#x27; surnames. There are also a handful of ancestral families on the island (traditionally known as &quot;bukra&quot;) of full European ancestry.

Due to historical economic and political differences, as well as the remnants of a 19th-century caste system based on skin complexion, socioeconomic class differences among ancestral native Crucians can vary widely, even within the same family. Most ancestral native Crucians today are employed by the Government of the Virgin Islands, while others are involved in the tourism industry and the legal and medical professions.

Puerto Rican migration was prevalent in the 1930s, &#x27;40s and &#x27;50s, when many Puerto Ricans relocated to St. Croix for work after the collapse of the sugar industry. The total population declined by 50% in the century preceding 1945.

The United States Navy purchase of two-thirds of the nearby Puerto Rican island of Vieques during World War II resulted in the displacement of thousands of &quot;Viequenses&quot;, many of whom relocated to St. Croix because of its similar size and geography. The local holiday of Puerto Rico/U.S. Virgin Islands Friendship Day has been celebrated since the 1960s on the second Monday of October, the same date as Columbus Day. St. Croix&#x27;s Puerto Ricans, most of whom have lived on the island for more than a generation, have kept their culture alive while integrating it into native Crucian culture and society. For example, in informal situations, many Puerto Ricans in St. Croix speak a Spanglish-like combination of Puerto Rican Spanish and Crucian Creole English.

Migration from &quot;down-island&quot; (a local colloquial term for islands in the Lesser Antilles to the east and southeast) occurred mainly in the 1960s and 70s. In that period, agriculture declined as St. Croix&#x27;s major industry, replaced by tourism, alumina production, and oil refining. Jobs were plentiful in these industries and down-islanders came to St. Croix by the thousands. The demand for imported labor in St. Croix was exacerbated by the fact that many ancestral native Crucians, having acquired U.S. citizenship decades earlier, migrated to the mainland U.S. to pursue educational and career opportunities. Many down-islanders made St. Croix their permanent home, while others relocated to the mainland U.S. or returned to their native countries. Most down-islanders came from St. Kitts and Nevis, Antigua, St. Lucia, and Dominica, but people from every Anglophone Caribbean nation can be found on St. Croix. Down-islanders and their St. Croix-born offspring form most of St. Croix&#x27;s middle class, which has dwindled in size since the 2008 global recession.

Down-island migration to St. Croix is most commonly thought of as a mid-20th century phenomenon brought upon by American immigration policy, but people of both European and African descent from the nearby islands of Anguilla, St. Martin, Sint Eustatius, Saba, St. Kitts, Nevis, Antigua, and Montserrat have been migrating to St. Croix since the 1600s. Many ancestral native Crucians also share family ties with Barbados, as Bajans were heavily recruited to St. Croix to work on sugar plantations in the late 19th century.

Continental Americans, although small in number in comparison with Caribbean immigrants, have also been part of the St. Croix community. Most reside on the island&#x27;s east end, and they tend to work in tourism, real estate, and legal professions. Many are temporary residents or retirees.

Arab Palestinians have been an influential part of the local economy since the 1960s, when they first started to migrate to St. Croix to set up shops, supermarkets, and gas stations.

In the 21st century, waves of migration to St. Croix have included people from the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, the Philippines, and various South American nations. St. Croix&#x27;s history of migration has sometimes caused tensions between immigrants and Crucians whose ancestry on the island dates back for generations. Tensions have subsided to some extent in recent years, mainly due to intermarriage among Crucians and other Caribbean peoples. In the late 1990s, many people supported legislation to define as a &quot;native U.S. Virgin Islander&quot; anyone who could trace their ancestry on the island to 1927, the year in which U.S. Virgin Islanders were granted U.S. citizenship. This effort by a select group of nationalist senators failed after much public outcry and controversy. It was learned that most native-born U.S. Virgin Islanders would not qualify as &quot;native&quot; under the proposed legislation, as their immigrant ancestors had arrived later than 1927, but thousands of Danish citizens would have qualified.

In 2009, the proposed U.S. Virgin Islands Constitution proposed by the Fifth Constitutional Convention established three definitions of U.S. Virgin Islanders: &quot;Ancestral Native Virgin Islander&quot;—those with ancestral ties (and their descendants); &quot;Native Virgin Islander&quot;—those born on the island (and their descendants); and &quot;Virgin Islander&quot;—any U.S. citizen who has resided in the territory for five years. The United States Congress rejected the proposed constitution in 2010 for violating the principle of equal rights for all citizens of the territory, &quot;native&quot; or not, and sent it back to the convention for further consideration. 

At the 2020 U.S. Census, St. Croix&#x27;s population was 41,004, and its population living in households was 39,442. Of its population living in households, 51.6% were born in the U.S. Virgin Islands; 15.6% were born in the United States; 3.9% were born in U.S. Island Area or Puerto Rico; and 29.0% were born elsewhere. Of those born elsewhere, 91.4% were born in the Caribbean; 3.0% were born in Asia; 2.5% were born in Europe; 1.9% were born in Central America or South America; and 1.2% were born elsewhere.
==Subdivisions==
For census and planning purposes, St. Croix is divided into the following subdistricts (with population per the 2020 U.S. census):
* Anna&#x27;s Hope Village (pop. 3,282)
* Christiansted (pop. 1,866)
* East End (pop. 2,336)
* Frederiksted (pop. 2,303)
* Northcentral (pop. 4,197)
* Northwest (pop. 3,431)
* Sion Farm (pop. 10,332)
* Southcentral (pop. 7,415)
* Southwest (pop. 5,842)

Historically, St. Croix, like the rest of the Virgin Islands, had been divided into quarters, with these further divided into estates. These were used for census purposes until 1980 until they were replaced by the subdistricts above, and estates are still commonly used for navigation, writing addresses, and discussing real estate.

==Language==
English has been the dominant language on St. Croix since the 1700s and the official language since 1917, when the United States purchased the Danish West Indies. Previously, the official language was Danish, but it was not widely spoken. Other languages spoken throughout St. Croix&#x27;s colonial history have included Irish, Scots, Spanish, and French, as well as a now-extinct Dutch Creole spoken by St. Thomas and St. John-born people living in St. Croix, as well as the local Creole English that still exists today.

Known on the island as &quot;Crucian&quot;, Virgin Islands Creole English is spoken by the majority of the population in informal situations. Spanish is spoken by migrants from Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic and their St. Croix-born offspring, and various French Creoles are spoken by St. Lucian, Dominican, and Haitian immigrants. Arabic is common among St. Croix&#x27;s Arab Palestinian community. Immigrants from the Anglophone Caribbean who came to St. Croix after their formative years tend to speak the English creoles of their respective islands in informal situations, which are, for the most part, mutually intelligible with Virgin Islands Creole English.
==Religion==
Christianity is St. Croix&#x27;s predominant religion; the island has been called the &quot;Land of Churches&quot; for the approximately 150 churches that serve its 50,000 residents.

Protestant denominations are the most prevalent, but there is also a significant Roman Catholic presence due to St. Croix&#x27;s large Hispanic population, as well as Irish influence during the Danish colonial period. Anglican, Methodist, Moravian, Presbyterian, Pentecostal, and Seventh-day Adventists are among the Protestant denominations prevalent on the island. There are also Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

As in most of the Caribbean, various forms of Rastafari are practiced on the island. Islam is prevalent among the Arab Palestinian community, and there is a Jewish presence as well. Hinduism and Islam are also practiced by the Indian population.

==Economy==
St. Croix was once an agricultural powerhouse. Today, tourism is St. Croix&#x27;s main source of revenue. A number of other industries contribute to its economy, including the refining of oil and the distilling of rum.

=== Agriculture ===
The Taino people were the first to develop organized agriculture on St. Croix, cultivating crops like cassava, potatoes, and corn.

During the island&#x27;s colonial period, St. Croix was an agricultural powerhouse in the Caribbean. The island&#x27;s biggest exports were sugarcane, cotton, and tobacco–planted, harvested, and processed by enslaved Africans. Sugarcane was the island&#x27;s primary export in the 18th and 19th centuries. With more than 150 sugar mills, St. Croix was one of the wealthiest sugar islands in the West Indies. 

After the abolition of slavery in 1848, St. Croix remained a predominantly agricultural society. That period ended with the rapid industrialization of the island&#x27;s economy in the 1960s. 

=== Oil ===

St. Croix has been the location of one of the world&#x27;s biggest oil refineries. In 1966, Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corporation (HOIVC), a division of the U.S.-based Hess Corporation, began operation on the island. In 1998, Hovensa LLC took over the refinery operatorship. Hovensa was a limited liability company owned and operated by HOVIC and Petroleos de Venezuela, SA (PDVSA), Venezuela&#x27;s national oil company. The refinery&#x27;s name changed to HOVENSA. Gas prices on St. Croix were slightly higher than average than in the continental U.S.

On January 18, 2012, Hovensa announced that its refinery would be permanently shut down. This had a major adverse effect on the economy of St. Croix and the entire U.S. Virgin Islands, as the refinery employed 1,200 residents and 950 contractors. Almost a decade later, the refinery restarted in January 2021; but it shut down again in May 2021 due to unsafe emissions.

=== Rum ===
St. Croix is also home to the Cruzan Rum Distillery, makers of Cruzan Rum, a brand of Beam Suntory, Inc. The Cruzan Rum Distillery was founded in 1760 as Estate Diamond, and for many years used locally grown sugar cane to produce a single &quot;dark&quot;-style rum. It now imports sugar cane molasses from other countries in the region, primarily the Dominican Republic and South America. In recent years, Cruzan Rum, along with Bacardi from Puerto Rico and Gosling&#x27;s from Bermuda, has contributed to the resurgence of &quot;single-barrel&quot;, super-premium rum. Cruzan Estate Rums has won more than 30 Spirit Awards. Cruzan Estate Diamond Rum (aged five years in American oak barrels) and Cruzan Single Barrel Estate Rum (aged 12 years in American oak barrels) are two examples.

Diageo completed construction of a new distillery on a 26-acre industrial site next to the HOVENSA refinery. The new distillery produces Captain Morgan Rum. Diageo&#x27;s entrance into the U.S. Virgin Islands rum industry has been controversial. The cash-strapped U.S. Virgin Islands government secured $250 million in bonds for the plant, about which the Puerto Rican government has bitterly complained.

=== Tourism ===
Today, tourism is St. Croix&#x27;s primary industries, accounting for 60% of the U.S. Virgin Islands&#x27; GDP. The island is a popular cruise port. In 2023–24, the cruise ship port at Frederiksted received 3–8 ships per month. Additionally, hotels and resorts, restaurants and bars, and tours and activities bring in revenue. Popular tourist activities include swimming, sailing, diving, snorkeling, and golf. 

==Transportation==

Cars on the island are driven on the left side of the road, but nearly all of them are left-hand drive. This has proven difficult for new residents and visitors from right-hand traffic locales such as the mainland U.S., the French and Dutch West Indies, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico. Roads have numerous potholes.

The Virgin Islands Department of Public Works operates a public bus service, Virgin Islands Transit, or VITRAN.

In addition to taxis and buses, St. Croix has shared taxis, locally known as &quot;taxi buses&quot; (also found on the other U.S. Virgin Islands). Taxi buses are full-sized vans running from Frederiksted to Christiansted. They are privately owned and operated; they do not follow a regular schedule and have no set stops. People simply wait by the side of the road until a taxi bus approaches, then flag the driver down by waving. Passengers can get out anywhere along the route. Taxi buses are not metered and are required by law to charge a flat rate of $2.50, regardless of where a rider gets on and off. Taxis to specific locations are much more expensive and are typically used by tourists.

Ferry service to St. Thomas restarted in 2017. The QE IV Ferry makes one trip per day departing from Gallows Bay, Christiansted, to Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas. The journey takes 2.5 hours and costs $60. The QE IV Ferry does not run during hazardous weather conditions. Some ferry companies based in St. Thomas and St. John sometimes operate St. Croix-to-St. Thomas service for special occasions, such as the St. Croix Agricultural Fair in February, Virgin Islands Carnival, Crucian Christmas Carnival, and horse races.

The Henry E. Rohlsen International Airport serves St. Croix with regular flights from the U.S. mainland, Puerto Rico, and the Eastern Caribbean. Seaplanes, operated by Seaborne Airlines, fly from St. Croix to St. Thomas, departing and arriving in Christiansted Harbor.

Though St. Croix is a U.S. territory, the U.S. Virgin Islands are maintained as a free port in a separate customs zone. Therefore, travelers to and from the contiguous United States and Puerto Rico, including U.S. citizens, must clear U.S. customs. U.S. travelers do not need to present a passport to entry the U.S. Virgin Islands, but may need to provide proof of citizenship or nationality upon departure. The immigration status of non-U.S. citizens may be verified during this process.

==Education==
The St. Croix School District operates a number of public schools in St. Croix. There are also multiple private schools, including St. Croix Montessori, Star Apple Montessori School, The Good Hope Country Day School, AZ Academy, St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic School, Free Will Baptist, St. Croix SDA School, and The Manor School. The island&#x27;s only colleges are the University of the Virgin Islands, St. Croix campus and Barry University, which operates a physician assistant training program.

==Culture==
===Festivals===
The island&#x27;s largest festival, Crucian Christmas Carnival, is celebrated on St. Croix throughout late December and early January. Another significant festival is the Agricultural and Food Fair, held in mid-February.

Several times a year, there is a nighttime festival in Christiansted called &quot;Jump-Up&quot; and a monthly event called &quot;Sunset Jazz&quot; in Frederiksted, where local jazz musicians play on Frederiksted Beach. Every year on the Saturday before Mardi Gras, there is a local Mardi Croix parade and a dog parade through the North Shore.

The St. Croix Half Ironman Triathlon is held in the first week of May. It includes a swim, a bike ride, and a run. Because the bicycle route includes a ride up an extremely steep hill known as &quot;The Beast&quot;, this triathlon is often nicknamed &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;.

==Points of interest==

Frederiksted maintains its Victorian era architecture and original seven-street-by-seven-street design, and has several historic structures. Among them are St. Patrick&#x27;s Catholic Church, built in the 1840s, and its primary school, the Customs House; the 19th-century Apothecary; and many other buildings, some of which hurricanes have transformed into scenic ruins. Frederiksted operates at a more relaxed pace than most of the island, and is more lively during Carnival in January and whenever visiting cruise ships are in port.

Salt River Bay National Historical Park and Ecological Preserve contains the only known site where members of a Columbus expedition set foot on what is now U.S. territory. It also preserves upland watersheds, mangrove forests, and estuarine and marine environments that support threatened and endangered species. The site is marked by Fort Salé, an earthworks fortification from French occupation, dating to around 1617. The park preserves prehistoric and colonial-era archeological sites, including the Caribbean&#x27;s only extant ball court. This is one of two sites on the island for bioluminescent bays (the other being Altona Lagoon).

Fort Christiansværn, built in 1749, and other buildings are maintained by the National Park Service as the Christiansted National Historic Site.

Buck Island Reef National Monument preserves a island just north of St. Croix and the surrounding reefs. It is a popular destination for snorkelers. Buck Island maintains a U.S. Coast Guard weather station and is home to a student-monitored lemon shark breeding ground. Green Cay (pronounced green key) is a small island southwest of Buck Island managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. It hosts a nearby reef popular among scuba divers and snorkelers, Tamarind Reef.

The farmer&#x27;s market (1 Estate, Kingshill, 00850, St. Croix) offers local fruit and vegetables, as well as plants, local food, and juice. The outdoor vendors open every Saturday from 6 a.m. to 12 p.m., sometimes longer. The farmer&#x27;s market is open year-round.

The St. Croix National Heritage Area was established by the National Heritage Area Act in 2022 to help preserve and promote historic and cultural sites across the island.

===Scuba diving, snorkeling, and watersports===

The waters surrounding St. Croix are warm year-round, with temperatures ranging from – , making it a popular destination for watersports including scuba diving, snorkeling, kayaking, paddleboarding, surfing, kite surfing, parasailing, jet skiing, fishing, and sailing. Two of the island&#x27;s most popular underwater sites for scuba divers are the Frederiksted Pier and the drop-off into deep water at Salt River Bay National Historical Park and Ecological Preserve.

Frederiksted is known for reef diving and access to wreck diving. The island&#x27;s western side has calm waters that allow snorkeling with access from the beach. Paddleboarding is popular near Frederiksted for the same reason. The Frederiksted Pier attracts scuba divers and snorkelers, as well as those who simply jump off it. The shallow water and sandy bottom around the pier are ideal for recreational diving by novice scuba divers in PADI Discover Scuba Diving programs (also called resort diving), for extended shore diving, night diving, and for underwater photography, especially of its abundant seahorse population.

A few hundred meters off the northern coast of the island, from Salt River to Cane Bay, the bottom drops suddenly into a deep trench, where coral reefs, abundant tropical fish, and migrant sea turtles may be observed. Kayaking is also popular in the Salt River.

Christiansted, a short distance from Buck Island and Green Cay, is a former capital of the Danish West Indies. It lies just east of the northern underwater drop-off and is protected by a reef.

===Bioluminescent bays===

There are two bioluminescent bays or bio bays on St. Croix. The most widely known and visited is at Salt River Bay National Historical Park and Ecological Preserve. The other is at Altona Lagoon. Bio bays are extremely rare; only seven year-round lagoons are known to exist in the Caribbean.

A combination of factors creates the necessary conditions for bioluminescence: red mangrove trees surround the water (the organisms have been related to mangrove forest, although mangrove is not necessarily associated with this species). A study at the Salt River bio bay is being conducted by faculty and students from the University of South Carolina, the University of North Carolina-Wilmington, and the University of the Virgin Islands. Their research focuses on analyzing quality and nutrient composition of the water, the distribution of a microorganism, the dinoflagellate &quot;Pyrodinium bahamense&quot;, that glows when the water is disturbed, and the abundance of &quot;cysts&quot;, dormant dinoflagellates embedded in the sea floor.

A concurrent complementary study is being undertaken by the St. Croix Environmental Association in conjunction with Scripps Institution of Oceanography. It focuses on counting the photon density of the phenomenon over time and in various weather conditions. Water quality and taxonomic analysis from both studies will be shared and correlated to create one of the most thorough investigations of year-round bioluminescent bays to date.

St. Croix&#x27;s two bio bays have very different characteristics. The one at Altona Lagoon is large but shallow, allowing one to see various marine life swimming and agitating the water, lighting it up. The bio bay at Salt River is smaller but deeper than Altona Lagoon. Because of its depth, it is also home to a second form of bioluminescence, Ctenophora, or comb-jellies, that are not found at Altona Lagoon.

A third bioluminescent organism is also found in Salt River. A species of marine &quot;Odontosyllis&quot; fireworm performs its brilliant green mating ritual within 57 hours after the full moon, females rising to the surface and leaving a luminescent green puddle for the males to race through, fertilizing the eggs.

<text>Abdul-Karim Qasim Muhammad Bakr al-Fadhli al-Zubaidi ( &quot;&quot; ; 21 November 1914 – 9 February 1963) was an Iraqi military officer and nationalist leader who came to power in 1958 when the Iraqi monarchy was overthrown during the 14 July Revolution. He ruled the country as the prime minister until his downfall and execution during the 1963 Ramadan Revolution.

Relations with Iran and the West deteriorated significantly under Qasim&#x27;s leadership. He actively opposed the presence of foreign troops in Iraq and spoke out against it. Relations with Iran were strained due to his call for Arab territory within Iran to be annexed to Iraq, and Iran continued to actively fund and facilitate Kurdish rebels in the north of Iraq. Relations with the Pan-Arab Nasserist factions such as the Arab Struggle Party caused tensions with the United Arab Republic (UAR), and as a result the UAR began to aid rebellions in Iraqi Kurdistan against the government.

During his rule, Qasim was popularly known as &quot;al-zaʿīm&quot; (الزعيم), or &quot;The Leader&quot;.

==Early life and career==

Abd al-Karim&#x27;s father, Qasim Muhammed Bakr Al-Fadhli Al-Zubaidi was a farmer from southern Baghdad and an Iraqi Sunni Muslim who died during the First World War, shortly after his son&#x27;s birth. Qasim&#x27;s mother, Kayfia Hassan Yakub Al-Sakini was a Shia Muslim Feyli Kurd from Baghdad.

Qasim was born in Mahdiyya, a lower-income district of Baghdad on the left side of the river, now known as Karkh, on 21 November 1914, the youngest of three sons. When Qasim was six, his family moved to Suwayra, a small town near the Tigris, then to Baghdad in 1926. Qasim was an excellent student and entered secondary school on a government scholarship. After graduation in 1931, he attended Shamiyya Elementary School from 22 October 1931 until 3 September 1932, when he was accepted into Military College. In 1934, he graduated as a second lieutenant. Qasim then attended al-Arkan (Iraqi Staff) College and graduated with honours (grade A) in December 1941. Militarily, he participated in the suppression of the tribal uprisings in central and southern Iraq in 1935, the 1941 Anglo-Iraqi War and the Barzani revolt in 1945. Qasim also served during the Iraqi military involvement in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War from May 1948 to June 1949. In 1951, he completed a senior officers’ course in Devizes, Wiltshire. Qasim was nicknamed &quot;the snake charmer&quot; by his classmates in Devizes because of his ability to persuade them to undertake improbable courses of action during military exercises. 

In the “July 14 Revolution” of 1958, he was one of the leaders of the “Free Officers” who overthrew King Faisal II and ended the monarchy in Iraq. The king, much of his family and members of his government were murdered. The reason for the fall of the monarchy was its policies, which were viewed as one-sidedly pro-Western (pro-British) and anti-Arab, which, among other things, were reflected in the Baghdad Pact with the former occupying power Great Britain (1955) and in the founding of the “Arab Federation” with the kingdom Jordan (March 1958). The government also wanted to send the army to suppress anti-monarchist protests in Jordan, which sparked the rebellion. Shortly after the revolution, officers rioted against Qasim in Mosul and Kirkuk. Both uprisings were suppressed with the help of the Iraqi communists and Kurds.

Toward the latter part of that mission, he commanded a battalion of the First Brigade, which was situated in the Kafr Qassem area south of Qilqilya. In 1956–57, he served with his brigade at Mafraq in Jordan in the wake of the Suez Crisis. By 1957 Qasim had assumed leadership of several opposition groups that had formed in the army.

== 14 July Revolution ==

On 14 July 1958, Qasim used troop movements planned by the government as an opportunity to seize military control of Baghdad and overthrow the monarchy. The king, several members of the royal family, and their close associates, including Prime Minister Nuri as-Said, were executed.

The coup was discussed and planned by the Free Officers Movement, which although inspired by the Egypt&#x27;s eponymous movement, was not as advanced or cohesive. From as early as 1952 the Iraqi Free Officers and Civilians Movement&#x27;s initial cell was led by Qasim and Colonel Isma&#x27;il Arif, before being joined later by an infantry officer serving under Qasim who would later go on to be his closest collaborator, Colonel Abdul Salam Arif. By the time of the coup in 1958, the total number of agents operating on behalf of the Free Officers had risen to around 150 who were all planted as informants or go-betweens in most units and depots of the army.

The coup was triggered when King Hussein of Jordan, fearing that an anti-Western revolt in Lebanon might spread to Jordan, requested Iraqi assistance. Instead of moving towards Jordan, however, Colonel Arif led a battalion into Baghdad and immediately proclaimed a new republic and the end of the old regime.

King Faisal II ordered the Royal Guard to offer no resistance, and surrendered to the coup forces. Around 8 am, Captain Abdul Sattar Sabaa Al-Ibousi, leading the revolutionary assault group at the Rihab Palace, which was still the principal royal residence in central Baghdad, ordered the King, Crown Prince &#x27;Abd al-Ilah, Crown Princess Hiyam (&#x27;Abd al-Ilah&#x27;s wife), Princess Nafeesa (&#x27;Abd al-Ilah&#x27;s mother), Princess Abadiya (Faisal&#x27;s aunt) and several servants to gather in the palace courtyard (the young King having not yet moved into the newly completed Royal Palace). When they all arrived in the courtyard they were told to turn towards the palace wall. All were then shot by Captain Abdus Sattar As Sab&#x27;, a member of the coup led by Qasim.

In the wake of the brutal coup, the new Iraqi Republic was proclaimed and headed by a Revolutionary Military Council. At its head was a three-man Sovereignty Council, composed of members of Iraq&#x27;s three main communal/ethnic groups. Muhammad Mahdi Kubbah represented the Arab Shia population, Khalid al-Naqshabandi the Kurds, and Muhammad Najib ar-Ruba&#x27;i the Arab Sunni population. This tripartite Council was to assume the role of the Presidency. A cabinet was created, composed of a broad spectrum of Iraqi political movements, including two National Democratic Party representatives, one member of al-Istiqlal, one Ba&#x27;ath Party representative and one Marxist.

After seizing power, Qasim assumed the post of Prime Minister and Defence Minister, while Colonel Arif was selected as Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister. They became the highest authority in Iraq with both executive and legislative powers. Muhammad Najib ar-Ruba&#x27;i became Chairman of the Sovereignty Council (head of state), but his power was very limited.

On 26 July 1958, the Interim Constitution was adopted, pending a permanent law to be promulgated after a free referendum. According to the document, Iraq was to be a republic and a part of the Arab nation while the official state religion was listed as Islam. Powers of legislation were vested in the Council of Ministers, with the approval of the Sovereignty Council, whilst executive function was also vested in the Council of Ministers.

==Prime minister==
Qasim assumed office after being elected as Prime Minister shortly after the coup in July 1958. He held this position until he was overthrown in February 1963.

Despite the encouraging tones of the temporary constitution, the new government descended into autocracy with Qasim at its head. The genesis of his elevation to &quot;Sole Leader&quot; began with a schism between Qasim and his fellow conspirator Arif. Despite one of the major goals of the revolution being to join the pan-Arabism movement and practise &quot;qawmiyah&quot; (Arab nationalism) policies, once in power Qasim soon modified his views to what is known today as Qasimism. Qasim, reluctant to tie himself too closely to Nasser&#x27;s Egypt, sided with various groups within Iraq, notably the social democrats, that told him such an action would be dangerous. Instead he found himself echoing the views of his predecessor, Said, by adopting a &quot;wataniyah&quot; policy of &quot;Iraq First&quot;. This caused a divide in the Iraqi government between the Iraqi nationalist Qasim, who wanted Iraq&#x27;s identity to be secular and civic nationalist, revolving around Mesopotamian identity, and the Arab nationalists who sought an Arab identity for Iraq and closer ties to the rest of the Arab world.
Unlike the bulk of military officers, Qasim did not come from the Arab Sunni north-western towns, nor did he share their enthusiasm for pan-Arabism: he was of mixed Sunni-Shia parentage from south-eastern Iraq. His ability to remain in power depended, therefore, on a skillful balancing of the communists and the pan-Arabists. For most of his tenure, Qasim sought to balance the growing pan-Arab trend in the military.

He lifted a ban on the Iraqi Communist Party, and demanded the annexation of Kuwait. He was also involved in the 1958 Agrarian Reform, modelled after the Egyptian experiment of 1952.

Qasim was said by his admirers to have worked to improve the position of ordinary people in Iraq after a long period of self-interested rule by a small elite under the monarchy which had resulted in widespread social unrest. Qasim passed law No. 80, which seized 99% of Iraqi land from the British-owned Iraq Petroleum Company and distributed farms to more of the population. This increased the size of the middle class. He also oversaw the building of 35,000 residential units to house the poor and lower middle classes. The most notable example of this was the new suburb of Baghdad named Madinat al-Thawra (Revolution City), renamed Saddam City under the Ba&#x27;ath regime and now widely referred to as Sadr City. He also rewrote the constitution to encourage women&#x27;s participation in society.

Qasim tried to maintain the political balance by using the traditional opponents of pan-Arabs, the right wing and nationalists. Up until the war with the Kurdish factions in the north, he was able to maintain the loyalty of the army.

He appointed as a minister Naziha al-Dulaimi, the first woman minister in the history of Iraq and the Arab world. She also participated in the drafting of the 1959 Civil Affairs Law, which was far ahead of its time in liberalising marriage and inheritance laws for the benefit of Iraqi women.

===Power struggles===
Despite a shared military background, the group of Free Officers that carried out 14 July Revolution was plagued by internal dissension. Its members lacked both a coherent ideology and an effective organisational structure. Many of the more senior officers resented having to take orders from Arif, their junior in rank. A power struggle developed between Qasim and Arif over joining the Egyptian-Syrian union. Arif&#x27;s pro-Nasserite sympathies were supported by the Ba&#x27;ath Party, while Qasim found support for his anti-unification position in the ranks of the Iraqi Communist Party.

Qasim&#x27;s change of policy aggravated his relationship with Arif who, despite being subordinate to Qasim, had gained great prestige as the perpetrator of the coup. Arif capitalised upon his new-found position by engaging in a series of widely publicised public speeches, during which he strongly advocated union with the UAR and making numerous positive references to Nasser, while remaining noticeably less full of praise for Qasim. Arif&#x27;s criticism of Qasim gradually became more pronounced. This led Qasim to take steps to counter his potential rival. He began to foster relations with the Iraqi Communist Party, which attempted to mobilise support in favour of his policies. He also moved to counter Arif&#x27;s power base by removing him from his position as deputy commander of the armed forces.

On 30 September 1958 Qasim removed Arif from his roles as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior. Qasim attempted to remove Arif&#x27;s disruptive influence by offering him a role as Iraqi ambassador to West Germany in Bonn. Arif refused, and in a confrontation with Qasim on 11 October he is reported to have drawn his pistol in Qasim&#x27;s presence, although whether it was to assassinate Qasim or commit suicide is a source of debate. No blood was shed, and Arif agreed to depart for Bonn. However, his time in Germany was brief, as he attempted to return to Baghdad on 4 November amid rumours of an attempted coup against Qasim. He was promptly arrested, and charged on 5 November with the attempted assassination of Qasim and attempts to overthrow the regime. He was brought to trial for treason and condemned to death in January 1959. He was subsequently pardoned in December 1962 and was sentenced to life imprisonment.

Although the threat of Arif had been negated, another soon arose in the form of Rashid Ali, the exiled former prime minister who had fled Iraq in 1941. He attempted to foster support among officers who were unhappy with Qasim&#x27;s policy reversals. A coup was planned for 9 December 1958, but Qasim was prepared, and instead had the conspirators arrested on the same date. Ali was imprisoned and sentenced to death, although the execution was never carried out.

===Kurdish revolts===

The new Government declared Kurdistan &quot;one of the two nations of Iraq&quot;. During his rule, the Kurdish groups selected Mustafa Barzani to negotiate with the government, seeking an opportunity to declare independence.

After a period of relative calm, the issue of Kurdish autonomy (self-rule or independence) went unfulfilled, sparking discontent and eventual rebellion among the Kurds in 1961. Kurdish separatists under the leadership of Mustafa Barzani chose to wage war against the Iraqi establishment. Although relations between Qasim and the Kurds had been positive initially, by 1961 relations had deteriorated and the Kurds had become openly critical of Qasim&#x27;s regime. Barzani had delivered an ultimatum to Qasim in August 1961 demanding an end to authoritarian rule, recognition of Kurdish autonomy, and restoration of democratic liberties.

===The Mosul uprising and subsequent unrest===
During Qasim&#x27;s term, there was much debate over whether Iraq should join the United Arab Republic, led by Gamal Abdel Nasser. Having dissolved the Hashemite Arab Federation with the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, Qasim refused to allow Iraq to enter the federation, although his government recognized the republic and considered joining it later.

Qasim&#x27;s growing ties with the communists served to provoke rebellion in the northern city of Mosul led by Arab nationalists in charge of military units. In an attempt to reduce the likelihood of a potential coup, Qasim had encouraged a communist-backed Peace Partisans rally to be held in Mosul on 6 March 1959. Some 250,000 Peace Partisans and communists thronged through Mosul&#x27;s streets that day. Although the rally passed peacefully, on 7 March, skirmishes broke out between communists and nationalists. This degenerated into a major civil disturbance over the following days. Although the rebellion was crushed by the military, it had a number of adverse effects that impacted Qasim&#x27;s position. First, it increased the power of the communists. Second, it increased the strength of the Ba’ath Party, which had been growing steadily since the 14 July coup. The Ba&#x27;ath Party believed that the only way of halting the engulfing tide of communism was to assassinate Qasim.

The Ba&#x27;ath Party turned against Qasim because of his refusal to join Gamal Abdel Nasser&#x27;s United Arab Republic. To strengthen his own position within the government, Qasim created an alliance with the Iraqi Communist Party (ICP), which was opposed to any notion of pan-Arabism. Later that year, the Ba&#x27;ath Party leadership put in place plans to assassinate Qasim. A young Saddam Hussein was a leading member of the operation. At the time, the Ba&#x27;ath Party was more of an ideological experiment than a strong anti-government fighting machine. The majority of its members were either educated professionals or students, and Saddam fitted in well within this group.

The choice of Saddam was, according to journalist Con Coughlin, &quot;hardly surprising&quot;. The idea of assassinating Qasim may have been Nasser&#x27;s, and there is speculation that some of those who participated in the operation received training in Damascus, which was then part of the United Arabic Republic. However, &quot;no evidence has ever been produced to implicate Nasser directly in the plot&quot;.

The assassins planned to ambush Qasim on Al-Rashid Street on 7 October 1959. One man was to kill those sitting at the back of the car, the others killing those in front. During the ambush it was claimed that Saddam began shooting prematurely, which disrupted the whole operation. Qasim&#x27;s chauffeur was killed, and Qasim was hit in the arm and shoulder. The would-be assassins believed they had killed him and quickly retreated to their headquarters, but Qasim survived.

The growing influence of communism was felt throughout 1959. A communist-sponsored purge of the armed forces was carried out in the wake of the Mosul revolt. The Iraqi cabinet began to shift towards the radical-left as several communist sympathisers gained posts in the cabinet. Iraq&#x27;s foreign policy began to reflect this communist influence, as Qasim removed Iraq from the Baghdad Pact on 24 March, and then fostered closer ties with the Soviet Union, including extensive economic agreements. However, communist successes encouraged them to attempt to expand their power. The communists attempted to replicate their success at Mosul in Kirkuk. A rally was called for 14 July which was intended to intimidate conservative elements. Instead it resulted in widespread bloodshed between ethnic Kurds (who were associated with the ICP at the time) and Iraqi Turkmen, leaving between 30 and 80 people dead.

Despite being largely the result of pre-existing ethnic tensions, the Kirkuk &quot;massacre&quot; was exploited by Iraqi anti-communists and Qasim subsequently purged the communists and in early 1960 he refused to license the ICP as a legitimate political party. Qasim&#x27;s actions led to a major reduction of communist influence in the Iraqi government. Communist influence in Iraq peaked in 1959 and the ICP squandered its best chance of taking power by remaining loyal to Qasim, while his attempts to appease Iraqi nationalists backfired and contributed to his eventual overthrow. For example, Qasim released Salih Mahdi Ammash from custody and reinstated him in the Iraqi army, allowing Ammash to act as the military liaison to the Ba&#x27;athist coup plotters. Furthermore, notwithstanding his outwardly friendly posture towards the Kurds, Qasim was unable to grant Kurdistan autonomous status within Iraq, leading to the 1961 outbreak of the First Iraqi–Kurdish War and secret contacts between the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and Qasim&#x27;s Ba&#x27;athist opponents in 1962 and 1963. The KDP promised not to aid Qasim in the event of a Ba&#x27;athist coup, ignoring long-standing Kurdish antipathy towards pan-Arab ideology. Disagreements between Qasim, the ICP and the Kurds thus created a power vacuum that was exploited by a &quot;tiny&quot; group of Iraqi Ba&#x27;athists in 1963.

===Foreign policy===
Qasim had withdrawn Iraq from the pro-Western Baghdad Pact in March 1959 and established friendly relations with the Soviet Union. Iraq also abolished its treaty of mutual security and bilateral relations with the UK. Iraq also withdrew from the agreement with the United States that was signed by the Iraqi monarchy in 1954 and 1955 regarding military, arms, and equipment. On 30 May 1959, the last of the British soldiers and military officers departed the al-Habbāniyya base in Iraq. Qasim supported the Algerian and Palestinian struggles against France and Israel.

Qasim further undermined his rapidly deteriorating domestic position with a series of foreign policy blunders. In 1959 Qasim antagonised Iran with a series of territory disputes, most notably over the Khuzestan region of Iran, which was home to an Arabic-speaking minority, and the division of the Shatt al-Arab waterway between south eastern Iraq and western Iran. On 18 December 1959, Abd al-Karim Qasim declared:

&quot;We do not wish to refer to the history of Arab tribes residing in Al-Ahwaz and Muhammareh (Khurramshahr). The Ottomans handed over Muhammareh, which was part of Iraqi territory, to Iran.&quot;

After this, Iraq started supporting secessionist movements in Khuzestan, and even raised the issue of its territorial claims at a subsequent meeting of the Arab League, without success.

In June 1961, Qasim re-ignited the Iraqi claim over the state of Kuwait. On 25 June, he announced in a press conference that Kuwait was a part of Iraq, and claimed its territory. Kuwait, however, had signed a recent defence treaty with the British, who came to Kuwait&#x27;s assistance with troops to stave off any attack on 1 July. These were subsequently replaced by an Arab force (assembled by the Arab League) in September, where they remained until 1962.

The result of Qasim&#x27;s foreign policy blunders was to further weaken his position. Iraq was isolated from the Arab world for its part in the Kuwait incident, whilst Iraq had antagonised its powerful neighbour, Iran. Western attitudes toward Qasim had also cooled, due to these incidents and his perceived communist sympathies. Iraq was isolated internationally, and Qasim became increasingly isolated domestically, to his considerable detriment.

After assuming power, Qasim demanded that the Anglo American-owned Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC) sell a 20% ownership stake to the Iraqi government, increase Iraqi oil production, hire Iraqi managers, and cede control of most of its concessionary holding. When the IPC failed to meet these conditions, Qasim issued Public Law 80 on 11 December 1961, which unilaterally limited the IPC&#x27;s concession to those areas where oil was actually being produced—namely, the fields at Az Zubair and Kirkuk—while all other territories (including North Rumaila) were returned to Iraqi state control. This effectively expropriated 99.5% of the concession. British and US officials and multinationals demanded that the Kennedy administration place pressure on the Qasim regime. The Government of Iraq, under Qasim, along with five petroleum-exporting nations met at a conference held 10–14 September 1960 in Baghdad, which led to the creation of the International Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries (OPEC).

==Overthrow and execution==
In 1962, both the Ba&#x27;ath Party and the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) began plotting to overthrow Qasim, with U.S. government officials cultivating supportive relationships with Ba&#x27;athist leaders and others opposed to Qasim. On 8 February 1963, Qasim was overthrown by the Ba&#x27;athists in the Ramadan Revolution; long suspected to be supported by the CIA. Pertinent contemporary documents relating to the CIA&#x27;s operations in Iraq have remained classified and as of 2021, &quot;[s]cholars are only beginning to uncover the extent to which the United States was involved in organizing the coup&quot;, but are &quot;divided in their interpretations of American foreign policy&quot;. Bryan R. Gibson, writes that although &quot;[i]t is accepted among scholars that the CIA ... assisted the Ba’th Party in its overthrow of [Qasim&#x27;s] regime&quot;, that &quot;barring the release of new information, the preponderance of evidence substantiates the conclusion that the CIA was not behind the February 1963 Ba&#x27;thist coup&quot;. 

Likewise, Peter Hahn argues that &quot;[d]eclassified U.S. government documents offer no evidence to support&quot; suggestions of direct U.S. involvement. On the other hand, Brandon Wolfe-Hunnicutt cites &quot;compelling evidence of an American role&quot;, and that publicly declassified documents &quot;largely substantiate the plausibility&quot; of CIA involvement in the coup. Eric Jacobsen, citing the testimony of contemporary prominent Ba&#x27;athists and U.S. government officials, states that &quot;[t]here is ample evidence that the CIA not only had contacts with the Iraqi Ba&#x27;th in the early sixties, but also assisted in the planning of the coup&quot;. Nathan J. Citino writes that &quot;Washington backed the movement by military officers linked to the pan-Arab Ba‘th Party that overthrew Qasim&quot;, but that &quot;the extent of U.S. responsibility cannot be fully established on the basis of available documents&quot;, and that &quot;[a]lthough the United States did not initiate the 14 Ramadan coup, at best it condoned and at worst it contributed to the violence that followed&quot;.

Qasim was given a short show trial and was shot soon after. He was executed by the Ba&#x27;athists inside the Ministry of Defence building; the Ba&#x27;athists desecrated his corpse on Iraqi television. Many of his Shi&#x27;a supporters believed that he had merely gone into hiding and would appear like the Mahdi to lead a rebellion against the new government. To counter this sentiment and terrorise his supporters, Qasim&#x27;s dead body was displayed on television in a five-minute long propaganda video called &quot;The End of the Criminals&quot; that included close-up views of his bullet wounds amid disrespectful treatment of his corpse, which was spat on in the final scene. About 100 government loyalists were killed in the fighting as well as between 1,500 and 5,000 civilian supporters of the Qasim administration or the Iraqi Communist Party during the three-day &quot;house-to-house search&quot; that immediately followed the coup.

==Legacy==
The 1958 Revolution can be considered a watershed in Iraqi politics, not just because of its obvious political implications (e.g. the abolition of monarchy, republicanism, and paving the way for Ba&#x27;athist rule) but also because of its domestic reforms. Despite its shortcomings, Qasim&#x27;s rule helped to implement a number of positive domestic changes that benefited Iraqi society and were widely popular, especially the provision of low-cost housing to the inhabitants of Baghdad&#x27;s urban slums. While criticising Qasim&#x27;s &quot;irrational and capricious behaviour&quot; and &quot;extraordinarily quixotic attempt to annex Kuwait in the summer of 1961&quot;, actions that raised &quot;serious doubts about his sanity&quot;, Marion Farouk–Sluglett and Peter Sluglett conclude that, &quot;Qasim&#x27;s failings, serious as they were, can scarcely be discussed in the same terms as the venality, savagery and wanton brutality characteristic of the regimes which followed his own&quot;. Despite upholding death sentences against those involved in the 1959 Mosul uprising, Qasim also demonstrated &quot;considerable magnanimity towards those who had sought at various times to overthrow him&quot;, including through large amnesties &quot;in October and November 1961&quot;. Furthermore, not even Qasim&#x27;s harshest critics could paint him as corrupt.

The revolution brought about sweeping changes in the Iraqi agrarian sector. Reformers dismantled the old feudal structure of rural Iraq. For example, the 1933 Law of Rights and Duties of Cultivators and the Tribal Disputes Code were replaced, benefiting Iraq&#x27;s peasant population and ensuring a fairer process of law. The Agrarian Reform Law (30 September 1958) attempted a large-scale redistribution of landholdings and placed ceilings on ground rents; the land was more evenly distributed among peasants who, due to the new rent laws, received around 55% to 70% of their crop. While &quot;inadequate&quot; and allowing for &quot;fairly generous&quot; large holdings, the land reform was successful at reducing the political influence of powerful landowners, who under the Hashemite monarchy had wielded significant power.

Qasim attempted to bring about greater equality for women in Iraq. In December 1959 he promulgated a significant revision of the personal status code, particularly that regulating family relations. Polygamy was outlawed, and minimum ages for marriage were also set out, with 18 being the minimum age (except for special dispensation when it could be lowered by the court to 16). Women were also protected from arbitrary divorce. The most revolutionary reform was a provision in Article 74 giving women equal rights in matters of inheritance. The laws applied to Sunni and Shia alike. The laws encountered much opposition and did not survive Qasim&#x27;s government.
