<text>, also known as the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM), is a Japanese science module for the International Space Station (ISS) developed by JAXA. It is the largest single ISS module, and is attached to the &quot;Harmony&quot; module. The first two pieces of the module were launched on Space Shuttle missions STS-123 and STS-124. The third and final components were launched on STS-127.

== Components ==
In initial configuration, &quot;Kibō&quot; consisted of six major elements:
* Pressurized Module (PM)
* Exposed Facility (EF)
* Experiment Logistics Module (ELM) Pressurized Section (ELM-PS)
* Experiment Logistics Module (ELM) Exposed Section (ELM-ES)
* Japanese Experiment Module remote manipulator system (JEMRMS)
* Inter-orbit communication system (ICS)

=== Pressurized Module ===
The Pressurized Module (PM) is the core component connected to the port hatch of &quot;Harmony&quot;. It is cylindrical in shape and contains twenty-three International Standard Payload Racks (ISPRs), ten of which are dedicated to science experiments while the remaining thirteen are dedicated to &quot;Kibō&quot;″s systems and storage. The racks are placed in a 6-6-6-5 format along the four walls of the module. The end of the PM has an airlock and two window hatches. The exposed facility, experiment logistics module, and remote manipulator system all connect to the PM. It is the location for many of the press conferences that take place on board the station.

=== Exposed facility ===
The Exposed Facility (EF), also known as &quot;Terrace&quot;, is located outside the port cone of the PM (which is equipped with an airlock). The EF has twelve Exposed Facility Unit (EFU) ports which attach to Payload Interface Unit (PIU) connectors on EF-equipment exchange units (EF-EEUs). All experiment payloads are fully exposed to the space environment. For proper functioning of these experiments, the payload requires an orbital replacement unit (ORU), consisting of the electrical power system (EPS), communications and tracking (CT), and the thermal control system (TCS). Of the twelve ORUs, eight are replaceable by the JEMRMS while the other four are EVA-replaceable.

=== Logistics module ===
The experiment logistics module (ELM) includes two sections:
* The pressurized section (ELM-PS), also called the JLP (Japanese logistics pressurized), is a pressurized addition to the PM. It is used as a storage facility, providing storage space for experiment payloads, samples and spare items.
* The unpressurized (external) section (ELM-ES) serves as a storage and transportation module. It was used to transfer external experiments with the Space Shuttle. It is not used after the retirement of the shuttle.

=== Remote manipulator system ===
The JEM remote manipulator system (JEMRMS) is a robotic arm, mounted at the port cone of the PM. It is used for servicing the EF and for moving equipment to and from the ELM. The JEMRMS control console was launched while inside the ELM-PS, and the main arm was launched with the PM. The small fine arm, which is long and attaches to the end effector of the main arm, was launched aboard HTV-1 on the maiden flight of the HTV spacecraft. Once HTV had docked, the small fine arm was assembled by the crew and deployed outside the airlock to test it. The JEMRMS grappled the arm and unfolded it to flex the joints before stowing it onto the EF. The free end of the JEMRMS is able to use the same type of grapple fixtures that the Canadarm2 uses.

=== Inter-orbit Communication System ===
Inter-orbit Communication System (ICS) consists of a rack of communication module in the Pressurized Module (ICS-PM) and the antenna module to be attached on the Exposed Facility (ICS-EF). It was used to communicate with the ground station via JAXA&#x27;s communication technology demonstration satellite . 
After the decommissioning of DRTS in August 2017, &quot;Kibō&quot; relies on the ISS&#x27;s Ku band communication through NASA&#x27;s TDRSS. ICS-EF was disposed by jettisoning into orbit in February 2020 and reentered on March 17, 2023 over Sacramento, California.

== Launch sequence ==
NASA launched the JEM complex over three flights using the Space Shuttle. The shuttle had a large payload bay which carried the modules into orbit along with the crew. This is in contrast to the Russian modules, which are launched into orbit on multistage Proton rockets and then rendezvous and dock with the station automatically.

On 12 March 2007, the &quot;Experiment Logistics Module-Pressurized Section&quot; (ELM-PS) arrived at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) from Japan. It was stored in the Space Station Processing Facility (SSPF) until launched into orbit aboard &quot;Endeavour&quot; on 11 March 2008 as part of the STS-123 mission.

On 30 May 2003, the &quot;Pressurized Module&quot; (PM), the main laboratory, arrived at KSC from Japan. It was stored at the SSPF until launched into orbit aboard &quot;Discovery&quot; on 31 May 2008 as part of the STS-124 mission. On 3 June 2008, the PM was attached to the &quot;Harmony&quot; module. At first the ELM-PS, the small cargo bay, was connected to a temporary location on &quot;Harmony&quot; and later, on 6 June 2008, was moved to its final berthing location on top (zenith) of the main laboratory.

The &quot;Exposed Facility&quot; (EF) and &quot;Experiment Logistics Module-External Section&quot; (ELM-ES) arrived at KSC on 24 September 2008. The two elements were launched on &quot;Endeavour&quot; on 15 July 2009 as part of the STS-127 mission. The ELM-ES was brought back to Earth at the end of the mission. The assembly of the EF was completed during the fifth spacewalk of the mission.

<doc id="229700" wikidata="Q126489660" url="?curid=229700" title="Supercharged (The Offspring album)">
<text>Supercharged is the eleventh studio album by the American punk rock band the Offspring, released on October 11, 2024 on Concord Records. Produced by Bob Rock, who had worked with the band on its previous three studio albums. It is the band&#x27;s first album to feature bassist Todd Morse as an official member, although the tracks he played on are unknown, and the band&#x27;s first album to feature multi-instrumentalist Jonah Nimoy and drummer Brandon Pertzborn, marking it the first album with the band as a five-piece.

== Background and recording ==
In a September 2022 interview with Brazilian radio station 89FM A Rádio Rock, frontman Dexter Holland confirmed that the Offspring had begun working on new material for their eleventh studio album: &quot;...[W]e wanna keep things rolling. We had to take time off in the pandemic and we feel like, &#x27;We&#x27;re back at it. Let&#x27;s make the most of it right now.&#x27; So we&#x27;re working on a new album.&quot; Holland told &quot;Times Colonist&quot; in November that the band would begin recording their new album in January 2023 with Bob Rock. The Offspring announced on social media in March 2023 that they were &quot;back in the studio.&quot;

In September 2023, when Noodles was asked if the new Offspring material follows an &quot;old-school&quot; vein or if it represents &quot;a new era of Offspring&quot;, he stated that &quot;It&#x27;s a little bit of both all that. The last song we did definitely sounds like an old-school — sounds kind of like &#x27;Come Out Swinging&#x27;. Definitely some old-school stuff and then some rocking stuff and then some kind of poppy punk stuff too, for sure.&quot;

In a May 2024 interview with Atlanta&#x27;s 99X radio station, Holland and guitarist Noodles confirmed that the band&#x27;s eleventh studio album was completed and that they were working on the cover art and album title. The following month, it was announced that the album was titled &quot;Supercharged&quot; and will be released on October 11, 2024. The first single from the album, &quot;Make It All Right&quot;, was released on June 7. The second single, &quot;Light It Up&quot; was released on August 2. The third single &quot;Come to Brazil&quot; was released on September 13. The fourth and final single &quot;OK, But This Is The Last Time&quot; was released on October 11. 

Holland later told in a press release &quot;We wanted this record to have pure energy — from the start to the finish! That&#x27;s why we called it Supercharged, from the height of our aspirations to the depths of our struggles, we talk about it all on this record…in a way that celebrates the life that we share and where we are now.&quot;

The album was recorded at three different locations: Maui, Vancouver, and the band&#x27;s home studio in Huntington Beach. 
The drum duties were split between new drummer, Brandon Pertzborn, and returning session drummer, Josh Freese, while the bass duties were split between lead vocalist, guitarist and primary songwriter Dexter Holland and bassist Todd Morse.

==Critical reception==
Critic reviews were generally favorable, with many regarding &quot;Supercharged&quot; as an improvement over their previous album, &quot;Let the Bad Times Roll&quot; (2021); despite this, it became the Offspring&#x27;s first studio album since &quot;Ignition&quot; (1992) not to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. The album was preceded by the singles &quot;Make It All Right&quot;, &quot;Light It Up&quot;, &quot;Come to Brazil&quot; and &quot;Ok, But This Is The Last Time&quot;.

<doc id="229703" wikidata="Q1853499" url="?curid=229703" title="Roots blower">
<text>The Roots blower is a positive displacement lobe pump which operates by pumping a fluid with a pair of meshing lobes resembling a set of stretched gears. Fluid is trapped in pockets surrounding the lobes and carried from the intake side to the exhaust. 

The Roots blower design does not incorporate any reduction in volume/increase in pressure as air or other fluid passes through, hence it can best be described as a blower rather than a supercharger unlike some other designs of &quot;supercharger&quot; such as cozette, centric, Shorrock supercharger, Powerplus supercharger and also the axial flow Eaton type supercharger which have internal &quot;compression&quot;. 

The most common application of the Roots-type blower has been the induction device on two-stroke diesel engines, such as those produced by Detroit Diesel and Electro-Motive Diesel. Roots-type blowers are also used to supercharge four-stroke Otto cycle engines, with the blower being driven from the engine&#x27;s crankshaft via a toothed or V-belt, a roller chain or a gear train.

The Roots-type blower is named after American inventors and brothers Philander and Francis Marion Roots, founders of the Roots Blower Company of Connersville, Indiana, who patented the basic design in 1860 as an air pump for use in blast furnaces and other industrial applications. In 1900, Gottlieb Daimler included a Roots-style blower in a patented engine design, making the Roots-type blower the oldest of the various designs now available. Roots blowers are commonly referred to as air blowers or PD (positive displacement) blowers.

== Applications ==
The Roots-type blower is simple and widely used. It can be more effective than alternative superchargers at developing positive intake manifold pressure (i.e., above atmospheric pressure) at low engine speeds, making it a popular choice for passenger automobile applications. Peak torque can be achieved by about 2000 rpm. Unlike the basic illustration, most modern Roots-type superchargers incorporate three-lobe or four-lobe rotors; this allows the lobes to have a along the rotor axes, which reduces pulsing in the input and output (this is impractical with two lobes, as even a slight twist could open up a free path through the supercharger at certain angles).

Accumulated heat is an important consideration in the operation of a compressor in an internal combustion engine. Of the three basic supercharger types, the Roots design historically possessed the worst thermal efficiency, especially at high pressure ratios. In accordance with the ideal gas law, a compression operation will raise the temperature of the compressed output. Additionally, the operation of the compressor itself requires energy input, which is converted to heat and can be transferred to the gas through the compressor housing, heating it more. Although intercoolers are more commonly known for their use on turbochargers, superchargers may also benefit from the use of an intercooler. Internal combustion is based upon a thermodynamic cycle, and a lower temperature of the intake charge results in a greater thermodynamic expansion and vice versa. A hot intake charge provokes detonation in a petrol engine, and can melt the pistons in a diesel, while an intercooling stage adds complexity but can improve the power output by increasing the amount of the input charge, exactly as if the engine were of higher capacity. An intercooler reduces the thermodynamic efficiency by losing the heat (power) introduced by compression, but increases the power available because of the increased working mass for each cycle. Above about the intercooling improvement can become dramatic. With a Roots-type supercharger, one method successfully employed is the addition of a thin heat exchanger placed between the blower and the engine. Water is circulated through it to a second unit placed near the front of the vehicle where a fan and the ambient air-stream can dissipate the collected heat.

The Roots design was commonly used on two-stroke diesel engines (popularized by the Detroit Diesel [truck and bus] and Electro-Motive [railroad] divisions of General Motors), which require some form of forced induction, because there is no separate intake stroke. The Rootes Co. two-stroke diesel engine, used in Commer and Karrier vehicles, had a Roots-type blower; the two companies are not related.

The superchargers used on top fuel engines, funny cars, and other dragsters, as well as hot rods, are in fact derivatives of General Motors Coach Division blowers for their industrial diesel engines, which were adapted for automotive use in drag racing. The model name of these units delineates their size - the once-commonly used 4–71 and 6–71 blowers were designed for 71 series diesels. Current competition dragsters use aftermarket GMC variants similar in design to the 71 series, but with the rotor and case length increased for added capacity; hot rodders also use reproduction 6-71s.

Roots blowers are typically used in applications where a large volume of air must be moved across a relatively small pressure differential. This includes low vacuum applications, with the Roots blower acting alone, or in combination with other pumps as part of a high vacuum system. One very common industrial application is in pneumatic conveying systems, the blower delivering a high volume of air for the movement of bulk solids through pipes.

Some civil defense sirens used Roots blowers to pump air to the rotor (chopper) so as to drastically increase its sound output through all pitch ranges. The most well known are the Federal Signal Thunderbolt Series, and ACA (now American Signal Corporation) Hurricane. These sirens are known as &quot;supercharged sirens&quot;.

Roots blowers are also used in reverse to measure the flow of gases or liquids, for example, in gas meters.

Roots blowers were used for cabin pressurisation in aircraft, initially being investigated immediately before WW2 (using the Marshall supercharger) and made by companies such as Sir George Godfrey and Partners who were still shipping increasing numbers into the 1960s, they were later superseded by air bleeds from jet engine compression stages.

== Technical considerations ==
The simplest form of a Roots blower has cycloidal rotors, constructed of alternating tangential sections of hypocycloidal and epicycloidal curves. For a two-lobed rotor, the smaller generating circles are one-quarter the diameter of the larger. Real Roots blowers may have more complex profiles for increased efficiency. The lobes on one rotor will not drive the other rotor with minimal free play in all positions, so that a separate pair of gears provide the phasing of the lobes.

Because rotary lobe pumps need to maintain a clearance between the lobes, a single stage Roots blower can pump gas across only a limited pressure differential. If the pump is used beyond its specification, the compression of the gas generates enough heat so that the lobes expand to the point that they jam, damaging the pump.

Roots pumps are capable of pumping large volumes but, as they only achieve moderate compression, it is not uncommon to see multiple Roots blower stages, frequently with heat exchangers (intercoolers) in between to cool the gas. The lack of oil on the pumping surfaces allows the pumps to work in environments where contamination control is important. The high pumping rate for hydrocarbons allows the Roots pump to provide an effective isolation between oiled pumps, such as rotary compression pumps, and the vacuum chamber.

A variant uses claw-shaped rotors for higher compression.

== Roots efficiency map ==
The Roots-type blower may achieve an efficiency of approximately 70% while achieving a maximum pressure ratio of two. Higher pressure ratios are achievable but at decreasing efficiency. Because a Roots-type blower pumps air in discrete pulses (unlike a screw compressor), pulsation noise and turbulence may be transmitted downstream. If not properly managed (through outlet piping geometry) or accounted for (by structural reinforcement of downstream components), the resulting pulsations can cause fluid cavitation and/or damage to components downstream of the blower.

For any given Roots blower running under given conditions, a single point will fall on the map. This point will rise with increasing boost and will move to the right with increasing blower speed. It can be seen that, at moderate speed and low boost, the efficiency can be over 90%. This is the area in which Roots blowers were originally intended to operate, and they are very good at it.

Boost is given in terms of pressure ratio, which is the ratio of absolute air pressure before the blower to the absolute air pressure after compression by the blower. If no boost is present, the pressure ratio will be 1.0 (meaning 1:1), as the outlet pressure equals the inlet pressure. 15psi boost is marked for reference (slightly above a pressure ratio of 2.0 compared to atmospheric pressure). At boost, Roots blowers hover between 50% and 58%. Replacing a smaller blower with a larger blower moves the point to the left. In most cases, as the map shows, this will move it into higher efficiency areas on the left as the smaller blower likely will have been running fast on the right of the chart. Usually, using a larger blower and running it slower to achieve the same boost will give an increase in compressor efficiency.

The volumetric efficiency of the Roots-type blower is very good, usually staying above 90% at all but the lowest blower speeds. Because of that, a blower running at low efficiency will still mechanically deliver the intended volume of air to the engine, but that air will be hotter. In drag racing applications, where large volumes of fuel are injected with that hot air, vaporizing the fuel absorbs the heat. That functions as a kind of liquid aftercooler system and goes a long way to negating the inefficiency of the Roots design in that application.

== Comparative advantages ==

Rotary lobe blowers, commonly called boosters in high vacuum application, are not used as a stand-alone pump. In high vacuum applications, the boosters&#x27; pumping speed can be used towards reducing the end pressure and increasing the pumping speed.

Fans
With a low increase in pressure, fans are commonly used to move substantial quantities of gas. They&#x27;re typically employed for the circulation of air in buildings, machine ventilation, cooling equipment and other industrial applications.

Blowers
Blowers are capable of creating medium air flow with moderate pressure levels. They are used in applications where the pressure need is higher than fans.

Compressors
Compressors generate higher air pressures in industrial applications generally between 8 and 12 bars with less amount of air flow rates.

== Related terms ==
The term &quot;blower&quot; is commonly used to define a device placed on engines with a functional need for additional airflow using a direct mechanical link as its energy source. The term blower is used to describe different types of superchargers. A screw type supercharger, Roots-type supercharger, and a centrifugal supercharger are all types of what are commonly described as blowers, however there is a distinction between a roots type supercharger which is a positive displacement pump &quot;blower&quot; with no internal volume reduction/pressure increase, and other types of supercharger such as the eccentric vane powerplus and the Eaton axial flow which have internal compression and are more correctly described as superchargers. 

Conversely, a turbocharger, using exhaust compression to spin its turbine, and not a direct mechanical link, is not generally regarded as a &quot;blower&quot; but simply a &quot;turbo&quot;.

<doc id="229705" wikidata="Q1064887" url="?curid=229705" title="Walmart de México y Centroamérica">
<text>Walmart de México y Centroamérica, also known as Walmex, is the Mexican and Central American Walmart division. Walmart de México y Centroamérica is Walmart&#x27;s largest division outside the U.S. as of October 31, 2022, consists of 2,804 stores around the country, including 300 Walmart Supercenter stores and 167 Sam&#x27;s Club stores. It has been traded in the Mexican Stock Exchange since 1977 (as Cifra). Walmart de México y Centroamérica is the biggest retailer in Latin America.

As of October 31, 2022, Walmart operated 2,804 retail outlets in Mexico, under the Walmart Supercenter, Sam&#x27;s Club, Bodega Aurrerá, Mi Bodega Aurrera, Walmart Express, and Bodega Aurrerá Express banners. As of 2012, the company was Mexico&#x27;s largest private sector employer with 209,000 employees. Approximately one-fifth of Walmart stores in the world are in Mexico. It competes with Soriana, La Comer, Chedraui, H-E-B, Casa Ley, S-Mart and Calimax.

Walmex&#x27;s restaurant division, Vips, was acquired by the Mexican restaurant company, Alsea, in September 2013 for around $626 million. Walmex also operated Suburbia, a chain of department stores which was acquired by Liverpool in 2016.

==History==

The company was founded in 1986 as Cifra by Jerónimo Arango. In 1991, Cifra and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. signed a joint venture agreement. This agreement allowed cooperation between the two companies and the opening of Walmart stores and Sam&#x27;s Clubs in Mexico. In 1997, Walmart increased its stake by acquiring 51% of Cifra. Cifra was renamed Wal-Mart de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. Walmart again increased its stake in Wal-Mart de Mexico to 60% in April 2000. After completing the acquisition of Walmart&#x27;s operations in Central America in January 2010, Walmart Mexico changed its name to Walmart de Mexico y Centroamérica.

In 1999, following the implementation of NAFTA, Walmex initiated Mexico&#x27;s first duty-free importation of fresh Canadian beef from Biological Farm Management Systems, an export company based in Alberta.

=== International expansion ===
==== Walmart Centroamérica ====
In 2005, Walmart entered the Central American market by acquiring 33% of Central American Retail Holding Company (CARHCO) from Dutch retailer Royal Ahold NV. CARHCO operated stores in Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Honduras and Nicaragua. In 2006, Walmart increased its stake to 51% and changed the name to Walmart Centroamérica.

==== Walmart de Mexico y Centroamérica ====
In December 2009, Walmart de México acquired 43% of Walmart Centroamérica from Walmart Stores Inc and 40% from two minority partners, paying over $1.4 billion pesos (approximately US$110 million) in cash and shares. In early 2010, the transaction was completed and Walmart de México was renamed Walmart de México y Centroamérica.

In Mexico, Walmart has 2,804 stores, including 300 Walmart Supercenter stores, and 167 Sam&#x27;s Club stores.

==Labor relations==
In 2008, a Mexican court ruled that Walmart de México could not pay its employees in vouchers redeemable only at the store, as it violated an article of the country&#x27;s Constitution.

In 2020, Walmart de México y Centroamérica was included in the Bloomberg Gender Equity Index for the third time. It is the only company in the self-service sector worldwide that has appeared in this index for three consecutive years. This Index is made up of 325 companies belonging to 50 industries.

==Bribery investigations==
An April 2012, investigative report in &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that a former executive of Walmart de Mexico alleged that, in September 2005, Walmart de Mexico had paid bribes via local fixers called &quot;gestores&quot; to officials throughout Mexico in order to obtain construction permits, information, and other favors. Walmart investigators found credible evidence that Mexican and American laws had been broken. Concerns were raised that Walmart executives in the United States &quot;hushed up&quot; the allegations. Reportedly, bribes were given to rapidly obtain construction permits, which gave Walmart a substantial advantage over its business competitors. A follow-up investigation by &quot;The New York Times,&quot; published December 17, 2012, revealed evidence that regulatory permission for siting, construction, and operation of nineteen stores had been obtained through bribery. There was evidence that a bribe of $52,000 was paid to change a zoning map, which enabled the opening of a Walmart store a mile from a historical site in San Juan Teotihuacán. After the initial article was released, Walmart released a statement denying the allegations and describing its anti-corruption policy. While an official Walmart report states that they found no evidence of corruption, the article alleges that previous internal reports had indeed turned up such evidence before the story became public. &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine contributor, Adam Hartung, also alluded that the bribery scandal was a reflection of Walmart&#x27;s &quot;serious management and strategy troubles,&quot; stating, &quot;[s]candals are now commonplace... [e]ach scandal points out that Walmart&#x27;s strategy is harder to navigate and is running into big problems.&quot;

As of December 2012, internal investigations ongoing into possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Walmart has invested $99 million in the internal investigations, which have expanded beyond Mexico to implicate operations in China, Brazil, and India. The case has added fuel to the debate as to whether foreign investment will result in increased prosperity, or if it merely allows local retail trade and economic policy to be taken over by &quot;foreign financial and corporate interests.&quot;

==Sale of Banco Walmart Financial Services to Inbursa==
In December 2014, Grupo Financiero Inbursa agreed to acquire Banco Walmart from the chain and create a commercial alliance to offer financial services to supermarket customers with a locally familiar banking entity, such as branded credit cards and banking services, the bank also serves Walmex associates who might need banking services such as bank accounts and salary deposits.

<doc id="229710" wikidata="Q17007278" url="?curid=229710" title="Centrifugal-type supercharger">
<text>A centrifugal supercharger is a specialized type of supercharger that makes use of centrifugal force in order to increase the manifold air pressure, MAP. An increased MAP allows the engine to burn more fuel, which results in an increased power output. Centrifugal superchargers are generally attached to the front of the engine via a belt-drive or gear-drive from the engine&#x27;s crankshaft.

==Types of centrifugal superchargers==

The centrifugal supercharger is used in many applications including, but not limited to, automotive, truck, marine, aircraft, motorcycles and UTV&#x27;s. Of these applications, they are most commonly utilized for increasing horsepower in street vehicles and race applications. While the first practical centrifugal compressor was designed in 1899, centrifugal superchargers evolved during World War II with their use in aircraft, where they were frequently paired with their exhaust driven counterpart, the turbocharger. This term refers to the fact that turbochargers are a specific type of centrifugal supercharger, one that is driven by a turbine.

Lately, centrifugal superchargers have become very common in today&#x27;s performance automotive world. Superchargers are sometimes installed as original equipment on some vehicles manufactured today. Centrifugal supercharging creates an efficient, compact and intercooler friendly means to boost horsepower in both gasoline and diesel engines for a wide variety of watercraft, land craft and aircraft.

===Automotive superchargers===

Centrifugal superchargers have become popular in the aftermarket as a bolt-on addition to improve performance. By design, centrifugal superchargers allow for easy integration of air-to-air or air-to-water intercooling. Several companies build centrifugal superchargers and also offer them as complete systems which can be easily installed by a mechanic or the auto enthusiast at home.

===Aircraft superchargers===

Because air pressure decreases with altitude, air compression helps maintain engine power as the aircraft climbs.

==Standard functionality==

===Components===
The four main components of a centrifugal supercharger are the volute (compressor housing), diffuser, impeller and transmission. Volutes are typically cast into a form from aluminum rather than other metals due to the combination of strength, weight, and resistance to corrosion. Volutes are then precision machined to match the impeller design. Impellers are designed in many configurations, and Euler&#x27;s pump and turbine equation plays an important role in understanding impeller performance. Impellers are often formed by casting metals into a form and then machined, with the highest quality impellers machined from solid billet.

The transmission provides a step-up ratio from the input shaft (driven from the engine crankshaft) to the output shaft, to which the impeller attaches (it is not uncommon for centrifugal supercharger impeller speeds to exceed 100,000 rotations per minute). The basic components of the gear drive centrifugal transmission are shafts, gears, bearings, and seals. Because of the high speeds and loads the transmission must endure, components are machined, ground and assembled to extremely close tolerances.

===Process===
The centrifugal supercharger draws its power from the movement of the drive where it is attached. At this point, the supercharger powers an impeller – or small rotating wheel. The impeller draws air into a small compressor housing (volute) and centrifugal force sends the air into the diffuser. The result is air that is highly pressurized, but that travels at low speed. The high-pressure, low-speed air is then fed into the engine, where the additional pressure gives the engine the ability to burn more fuel and have a higher level of combustion. This results in a faster, more responsive vehicle due to greater engine volumetric efficiency.

==Uses for centrifugal-type superchargers==

===Personal/recreational===

Beyond the use in aircraft which drove many improvements in centrifugal design, more widespread use of the centrifugal supercharger has been heavily focused on the automotive performance aftermarket.

Improvements in design and machining technology have allowed for major advancements in compressor efficiency, as well as bearing and seal design. As a reliable, safe and affordable (dollar per horsepower) option to increase the performance of cars, truck, boats, motorcycles and UTV&#x27;s, centrifugal supercharging has become a viable option for performance enthusiasts in a variety of applications. Due to the ease of installation, and the fact that many systems utilize integrated intercooling, centrifugal supercharging continues to gain popularity within the performance industry.

===Commercial===

Centrifugal supercharger technology has also found its way into industrial applications. From wastewater treatment to aircraft deicing, air compression from a centrifugal supercharger has significantly improved the efficiency and reliability of the overall system. In many industries, pneumatic conveying is now the preferred method for moving product or media within a facility. Traditionally the only source for air flow of this volume was considered to be a Roots style compressor. Due to its efficient design, centrifugal technology is now being embraced because it offers substantial energy savings, lower discharge air temperatures and quieter operation.

==Benefits of centrifugal-type superchargers==

===Performance===
Engine driven Centrifugal superchargers are inferior to Roots-type superchargers in building torque low in the RPM range but superior to Roots-type superchargers in thermodynamic efficiency (less heat is generated when compressing the air).

====Adiabatic efficiency====
Because centrifugal superchargers utilize centrifugal forces to compress the air, they offer higher efficiency than positive displacement designs, both in terms of power consumption and heat production. &quot;Perhaps the simplest of all superchargers, the centrifugal can also be the most thermally efficient&quot;. The compressor-side of turbochargers are centrifugal designs as well, and also feature high efficiency.

====Minimal heat transfer====
Centrifugal superchargers are typically mounted off to the side on the front of the engine. Distancing the supercharger from the engine via a mounting bracket greatly reduces heat transfer from the engine to the supercharger during operation. By comparison, a twin screw or roots blower which is nested in the center (valley) of the engine, will absorb heat (heat soak) during operation due to thermal transfer from the engine block and heads. Elevated temperature levels in the supercharger directly influence discharge air temperatures that next enter the engine. Higher engine inlet air temperatures result in reduced power increases and an increased likelihood of engine damage resulting from detonation within the cylinders. See also intercooling (charge-air density increase).

<doc id="229714" wikidata="Q235356" url="?curid=229714" title="Carriage">
<text>A carriage is a two- or four-wheeled horse-drawn vehicle for passengers. In Europe they were a common mode of transport for the wealthy during the Roman Empire, and then again from around 1600 until they were replaced by the motor car around 1900. They were generally owned by the rich, but second-hand private carriages became common public transport, the equivalent of modern cars used as taxis. Carriage suspensions are by leather strapping or, on those made in recent centuries, steel springs. There are numerous names for different types. Two-wheeled carriages are usually owner-driven.

Coaches are a special category within carriages. They are carriages with four corner posts and a fixed roof. Two-wheeled war chariots and transport vehicles such as four-wheeled wagons and two-wheeled carts were forerunners of carriages.

In the 21st century, horse-drawn carriages are occasionally used for public parades by royalty and for traditional formal ceremonies. Simplified modern versions are made for tourist transport in warm countries and for those cities where tourists expect open horse-drawn carriages to be provided. Simple metal sporting versions are still made for the sport known as competitive driving.

==Overview==
The word &quot;carriage&quot; (abbreviated &quot;carr&quot; or &quot;cge&quot;) is from Old Northern French , to carry in a vehicle. The word &quot;car&quot;, then meaning a kind of two-wheeled cart for goods, also came from Old Northern French about the beginning of the 14th century (probably derived from the Late Latin , a car); it is also used for railway carriages and in the US around the end of the 19th century, early cars (automobiles) were briefly called &quot;horseless carriages&quot;.

==History==

=== Early history ===

Some horse carts found in Celtic graves show hints that their platforms were suspended elastically. Four-wheeled wagons were used in Bronze Age Europe, and their form known from excavations suggests that the basic construction techniques of wheel and undercarriage (that survived until the age of the motor car) were established then.

First prototyped in the 3rd millennium BC, a &quot;bullock cart&quot; is a large two-wheeled cart pulled by oxen or buffalo. It includes a sturdy wooden pole between the oxen, a yoke connecting a pair of oxen, a wooden platform for passengers or cargo, and large steel rimmed wooden wheels.

Two-wheeled carriage models have been discovered from the Indus valley civilization including twin horse drawn covered carriages resembling ekka from various sites such as Harappa, Mohenjo Daro and Chanhu Daro. The earliest recorded sort of carriage was the chariot, reaching Mesopotamia as early as 1900 BC. Used typically for warfare by Egyptians, the Near Easterners and Europeans, it was essentially a two-wheeled light basin carrying one or two standing passengers, drawn by one to two horses. The chariot was revolutionary and effective because it delivered fresh warriors to crucial areas of battle with swiftness.

===Roman carriage===
First century BC Romans used sprung wagons for overland journeys. It is likely that Roman carriages employed some form of suspension on chains or leather straps, as indicated by carriage parts found in excavations. In 2021 archaeologists discovered the remains of a ceremonial four wheel carriage, a pilentum, near the ancient Roman city of Pompeii. It is thought the pilentum may have been used in ceremonies such as weddings. The find has been described as being &quot;in an excellent state of preservation&quot;.

===Ancient Chinese carriage===

Though the exact date of when the Chinese started to use carriages is largely unknown, early oracle bone inscriptions discovered in Henan province show that the carriage had already developed into many different forms.
The earliest archaeological evidence of chariots in China, a chariot burial site discovered in 1933 at Hougang, Anyang in Henan province, dates to the rule of King Wu Ding of the late Shang dynasty (). Oracle bone inscriptions suggest that the western enemies of the Shang used limited numbers of chariots in battle, but the Shang themselves used them only as mobile command-vehicles and in royal hunts.

During the Shang dynasty, members of the royal family were buried with a complete household and servants, including a chariot, horses, and a charioteer. A Shang chariot was often drawn by two horses, but four-horse variants are occasionally found in burials.

Jacques Gernet claims that the Zhou dynasty, which conquered the Shang ca. 1046 BCE, made more use of the chariot than did the Shang and &quot;invented a new kind of harness with four horses abreast&quot;. The crew consisted of an archer, a driver, and sometimes a third warrior who was armed with a spear or dagger-axe. From the 8th to 5th centuries BCE the Chinese use of chariots reached its peak. Although chariots appeared in greater numbers, infantry often defeated charioteers in battle.

Massed-chariot warfare became all but obsolete after the Warring-States Period (476–221 BCE). The main reasons were increased use of the crossbow, use of long halberds up to long and pikes up to long, and the adoption of standard cavalry units, and the adaptation of mounted archery from nomadic cavalry, which were more effective. Chariots would continue to serve as command posts for officers during the Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE) and the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), while armored chariots were also used during the Han dynasty against the Xiongnu Confederation in the Han–Xiongnu War (133 BC to 89 CE), specifically at the Battle of Mobei (119 BCE).

Before the Han dynasty, the power of Chinese states and dynasties was often measured by the number of chariots they were known to have. A country of a thousand chariots ranked as a medium country, and a country of ten thousand chariots ranked as a huge and powerful country.
===Medieval carriage===
The medieval carriage was typically a four-wheeled wagon type, with a rounded top (&quot;tilt&quot;) similar in appearance to the Conestoga Wagon familiar from the United States. Sharing the traditional form of wheels and undercarriage known since the Bronze Age, it very likely also employed the pivoting fore-axle in continuity from the ancient world. Suspension (on chains) is recorded in visual images and written accounts from the 14th century (&quot;chars branlant&quot; or rocking carriages), and was in widespread use by the 15th century. Carriages were largely used by royalty, aristocrats (and especially by women), and could be elaborately decorated and gilded. These carriages were usually on four wheels and were drawn by two to four horses depending on their size and status. Wood and iron were the primary materials needed to build a carriage and carriages that were used by non-royalty were covered by plain leather.

Another form of carriage was the pageant wagon of the 14th century. Historians debate the structure and size of pageant wagons; however, they are generally miniature house-like structures that rest on four to six wheels depending on the size of the wagon. The pageant wagon is significant because up until the 14th century most carriages were on two or three wheels; the chariot, rocking carriage, and baby carriage are two examples of carriages which pre-date the pageant wagon. Historians also debate whether or not pageant wagons were built with pivotal axle systems, which allowed the wheels to turn. Whether it was a four- or six-wheel pageant wagon, most historians maintain that pivotal axle systems were implemented on pageant wagons because many roads were often winding with some sharp turns. Six wheel pageant wagons also represent another innovation in carriages; they were one of the first carriages to use multiple pivotal axles. Pivotal axles were used on the front set of wheels and the middle set of wheels. This allowed the horse to move freely and steer the carriage in accordance with the road or path.

===Coach===

One of the great innovations in carriage history was the invention of the suspended carriage or the &quot;chariot branlant&quot; (though whether this was a Roman or medieval innovation remains uncertain). The &quot;chariot branlant&quot; of medieval illustrations was suspended by chains rather than leather straps as had been believed. Suspension, whether on chains or leather, might provide a smoother ride since the carriage body no longer rested on the axles, but could not prevent swinging (branlant) in all directions. It is clear from illustrations (and surviving examples) that the medieval suspended carriage with a round tilt was a widespread European type, referred to by any number of names (car, currus, char, chariot).

In 14th century England carriages, like the one illustrated in the Luttrell Psalter, would still have been a quite rare means of aristocratic transport, and they would have been very costly until the end of the century. They would have had four six-spoke six-foot high wheels that were linked by greased axles under the body of the coach, and did not necessarily have any suspension. The chassis was made from oak beam and the barrel shaped roof was covered in brightly painted leather or cloth. The interior would include seats, beds, cushions, tapestries and even rugs. They would be pulled by four to five horses.

Under King Mathias Corvinus (1458–90), who enjoyed fast travel, the Hungarians developed fast road transport, and the town of Kocs between Budapest and Vienna became an important post-town, and gave its name to the new vehicle type. The earliest illustrations of the Hungarian &quot;Kochi-wagon&quot; do not indicate any suspension, a body with high sides of lightweight wickerwork, and typically drawn by three horses in harness. Later models were considerably lighter and famous for a single horse being able to draw many passengers.
The Hungarian coach spread across Europe, initially rather slowly, in part due to Ippolito d&#x27;Este of Ferrara (1479–1520), nephew of Mathias&#x27; queen Beatrix of Aragon, who as a very junior Archbishopric of Esztergom developed a taste for Hungarian riding and took his carriage and driver back to Italy. Then rather suddenly, in around 1550, the &quot;coach&quot; made its appearance throughout the major cities of Europe, and the new word entered the vocabulary of all their languages. However, the new &quot;coach&quot; seems to have been a fashionable concept (fast road travel for men) as much as any particular type of vehicle, and there is no obvious technological change that accompanied the innovation, either in the use of suspension (which came earlier), or the adoption of springs (which came later). As its use spread throughout Europe in the late 16th century, the coach&#x27;s body structure was ultimately changed, from a round-topped tilt to the &quot;four-poster&quot; carriages that became standard everywhere by c.1600.
===Later development of the coach===

The coach had doors in the side, with an iron step protected by leather that became the &quot;boot&quot; in which servants might ride. The driver sat on a seat at the front, and the most important occupant sat in the back facing forwards. The earliest coaches can be seen at Veste Coburg, Lisbon, and the Moscow Kremlin, and they become a commonplace in European art. It was not until the 17th century that further innovations with steel springs and glazing took place, and only in the 18th century, with better road surfaces, was there a major innovation with the introduction of the steel C-spring.

Many innovations were proposed, and some patented, for new types of suspension or other features. It was only from the 18th century that changes to steering systems were suggested, including the use of the &#x27;fifth wheel&#x27; substituted for the pivoting fore-axle, and on which the carriage turned. Another proposal came from Erasmus Darwin, a young English doctor who was driving a carriage about 10,000 miles a year to visit patients all over England. Darwin found two essential problems or shortcomings of the commonly used light carriage or Hungarian carriage. First, the front wheels were turned by a pivoting front axle, which had been used for years, but these wheels were often quite small and hence the rider, carriage and horse felt the brunt of every bump on the road. Secondly, he recognized the danger of overturning.

A pivoting front axle changes a carriage&#x27;s base from a rectangle to a triangle because the wheel on the inside of the turn is able to turn more sharply than the outside front wheel. Darwin suggested a fix for these insufficiencies by proposing a principle in which the two front wheels turn (independently of the front axle) about a centre that lies on the extended line of the back axle. This idea was later patented in 1818 as Ackermann steering. Darwin argued that carriages would then be easier to pull and less likely to overturn.

Carriage use in North America came with the establishment of European settlers. Early colonial horse tracks quickly grew into roads especially as the colonists extended their territories southwest. Colonists began using carts as these roads and trading increased between the north and south. Eventually, carriages or coaches were sought to transport goods as well as people. As in Europe, chariots, coaches and carriages were a mark of status. The tobacco planters of the South were some of the first Americans to use the carriage as a form of human transportation. As the tobacco farming industry grew in the southern colonies so did the frequency of carriages, coaches and wagons. Upon the turn of the 18th century, wheeled vehicle use in the colonies was at an all-time high. Carriages, coaches and wagons were being taxed based on the number of wheels they had. These taxes were implemented in the South primarily as the South had superior numbers of horses and wheeled vehicles when compared to the North. Europe, however, still used carriage transportation far more often and on a much larger scale than anywhere else in the world.

===Demise===
Carriages and coaches began to disappear as use of steam propulsion began to generate more and more interest and research. Steam power quickly won the battle against animal power as is evident by a newspaper article written in England in 1895 entitled &quot;Horseflesh vs. Steam&quot;. The article highlights the death of the carriage as the main means of transportation.

===Today===
Today, carriages are still used for day-to-day transport in the United States by some minority groups such as the Amish. They are also still used in tourism as vehicles for sightseeing in cities such as Bruges, Vienna, New Orleans, and Little Rock, Arkansas.

The most complete working collection of carriages can be seen at the Royal Mews in London where a large selection of vehicles is in regular use. These are supported by a staff of liveried coachmen, footmen and postilions. The horses earn their keep by supporting the work of the Royal Household, particularly during ceremonial events. Horses pulling a large carriage known as a &quot;covered brake&quot; collect the Yeoman of the Guard in their distinctive red uniforms from St James&#x27;s Palace for Investitures at Buckingham Palace; High Commissioners or Ambassadors are driven to their audiences with the King and Queen in landaus; visiting heads of state are transported to and from official arrival ceremonies and members of the Royal Family are driven in Royal Mews coaches during Trooping the Colour, the Order of the Garter service at Windsor Castle and carriage processions at the beginning of each day of Royal Ascot.

==Construction==

===Body===

Carriages may be enclosed or open, depending on the type. The top cover for the body of a carriage is called the &quot;head&quot; or &quot;hood&quot;, and is sometimes flexible and designed to be folded back when desired. Such a folding top is called a &quot;bellows top&quot; or &quot;calash&quot;. A &quot;hoopstick&quot; forms a light framing member for this kind of hood. The top, roof or second-story compartment of a coach was called an &quot;imperial&quot;. A closed carriage may have side windows called &quot;quarter lights&quot; (British) as well as windows in the doors, hence a &quot;glass coach&quot;. On the forepart of an open carriage, a screen of wood or leather called a &quot;dashboard&quot; intercepts water, mud or snow thrown up by the heels of the horses. The dashboard or carriage top sometimes has a projecting sidepiece called a &quot;wing&quot; (British). A &quot;foot iron&quot; or &quot;footplate&quot; may serve as a carriage step.

A carriage driver sits on a &quot;box&quot; or &quot;perch&quot;, usually elevated and small. When at the front, it is known as a &quot;dickey box&quot;, a term also used for a seat at the back for servants. A footman might use a small platform at the rear called a &quot;footboard&quot; or a seat called a &quot;rumble&quot; behind the body. Some carriages have a small fold-down seat called a &quot;jump seat&quot;. Some seats had an attached backrest called a &quot;lazyback&quot;.

The shafts of a carriage were called &quot;limbers&quot; in English dialect. &quot;Lancewood&quot;, a tough elastic wood of various trees, was often used especially for carriage shafts. A &quot;holdback&quot;, consisting of an iron catch on the shaft with a looped strap, enables a horse to back or hold back the vehicle. The end of the tongue of a carriage is suspended from the collars of the harness by a bar called the &quot;yoke&quot;. At the end of a trace, a loop called a &quot;cockeye&quot; attaches to the carriage.

In some carriage types, the body is suspended by several leather straps called &quot;thoroughbraces&quot; or &quot;braces&quot; which serve as springs.

===Undercarriage===

Beneath the carriage body is the &quot;undergear&quot; or &quot;undercarriage&quot; (or simply &quot;carriage&quot;), consisting of the running gear and chassis. The wheels and axles, in distinction from the body, are the &quot;running gear&quot;. The wheels revolve upon bearings or a spindle at the ends of a bar or beam called an &quot;axle&quot; or &quot;axletree&quot;. Most carriages have either one or two axles. On a four-wheeled vehicle, the forward part of the running gear, or &quot;forecarriage&quot;, is arranged to permit the front axle to turn independently of the fixed rear axle. In some carriages a dropped axle, bent twice at a right angle near the ends, allows for a low body with large wheels. A guard called a &quot;dirtboard&quot; keeps dirt from the axle arm.

Several structural members form parts of the chassis supporting the carriage body. The fore axletree and the splinter bar above it (supporting the springs) are united by a piece of wood or metal called a futchel, which forms a socket for the pole that extends from the front axle. For strength and support, a rod called the &quot;backstay&quot; may extend from either end of the rear axle to the reach, the pole or rod joining the hind axle to the forward bolster above the front axle.

A skid called a &quot;drag&quot;, &quot;dragshoe&quot;, &quot;shoe&quot; or &quot;skidpan&quot; retards the motion of the wheels. A London patent of 1841 describes one such apparatus: &quot;An iron-shod beam, slightly longer than the radius of the wheel, is hinged under the axle so that when it is released to strike the ground the forward momentum of the vehicle wedges it against the axle&quot;. The original feature of this modification was that instead of the usual practice of having to stop the carriage to retract the beam and so lose useful momentum the chain holding it in place is released (from the driver&#x27;s position) so that it is allowed to rotate further in its backwards direction, releasing the axle. A system of &quot;pendant-levers&quot; and straps then allows the beam to return to its first position and be ready for further use.

A catch or block called a &quot;trigger&quot; may be used to hold a wheel on an incline.

A horizontal wheel or segment of a wheel called a &quot;fifth wheel&quot; sometimes forms an extended support to prevent the carriage from tipping; it consists of two parts rotating on each other about the kingbolt or perchbolt above the fore axle and beneath the body. A block of wood called a &quot;headblock&quot; might be placed between the fifth wheel and the forward spring.

=== Wheels ===
The basic parts of a wheel are nave (or hub), spokes, felloes (felly) and tyre (tire).

In a wooden-wheel, the nave is the central block. It acts as the hub. One end of each spoke is set into the nave with a mortise and tenon joint. In older wheels, the nave had a 6-inch sleeve that fit over the axle to keep the wheel from wobbling; it required frequent greasing. Modern wheels use metal bearings in the hub.

Spokes are the pieces that fit into the nave or hub at the center, radiate outwards, and join into the felloes at the outer edge.

In a wooden-wheel, a felloe is one of several curved pieces of wood that are pieced together in a circle to make the rim of a wheel. They are fitted onto the outer ends of the spokes. Sometimes spelled &quot;felly&quot;. The number of felloes required to make a circle varied by region, era and size of wheel—with a minimum of two half-circles of bent wood, to multiple felloes per wheel with at least two spokes per felloe. Felloes are part of wood joinery and are only seen in wooden wheels, not modern metal carriage wheels.

The rim is the outer edge of a wheel, although some refer to the tyre as rim.

The tyre or tire is a protective strip that goes outside the felloes. Tyres were make of iron or steel, usually as a hoop and fitted hot around the rim. As it cooled and shrank it tightened the joints of the spokes-to-felloes and spokes-to-nave, strengthening the wheel and making it more rigid. Metal tyres are very noisy on hard road surfaces, so many carriages wheels were made with solid rubber tyres fitted into a metal channel.

Modern sport carriages such as the marathon carriage have hard rubber tires and all metal wheels. Some lightweight carriages, such as the sulky, have metal &quot;bicycle spokes&quot; and pneumatic tires.

Due to age or dry climate, a wooden wheel would shrink and metal hoop tyres would become loose. Routinely, the hoop would be removed by a wheelwright, &#x27;shrunk&#x27;, heated and refitted to make the wheel tight again. Tools to shrink the hoops were called &quot;tire upsetters&quot; or &quot;tire shrinkers&quot;. 

=== Fittings, furnishings and appointments ===

Originally, the word &quot;fittings&quot; referred to metal elements such as bolts and brackets, &quot;furnishings&quot; leaned more to leatherwork and upholstery or referred to metal buckles on harness, and &quot;appointments&quot; were things brought to a carriage but not part of it, however all of these words have blended together over time and are often used interchangeably to mean the smaller components or parts of a carriage or equipment. All the shiny metal fittings on a vehicle should be one color, such as brass (yellow) or nickel (white), and should match the buckle color of any harness used with the vehicle. Early bodies of horseless carriages were constructed by coachmakers using the same parts used in carriages and coaches, and some horse carriage terminology has survived in modern automobiles.

* Upholstery: Seats might be upholstered using leather, broadcloth, or plush fabrics. Elegant carriages might have upholstery-lined walls and ceilings, and button-tucked velvet seats trimmed with gold braid.
* Carriage lamps: First used around 1700, oil-powered lamps were used throughout the 1800s, though abandoned in favor of candles in the late 1800s, as oil was messy. Lamps are mounted on &quot;lamp brackets&quot; and are removable for storage, daily wick trimming, or during daylight hours.
* Boot: Any of several box-like parts of a carriage used for storage of small items. A boot may be found under the coachman&#x27;s seat, under the passenger&#x27;s seat, or behind the body of the carriage between the rear wheels. This led to the use of the term boot in British English for the main storage compartment of an automobile.
* Whip socket: Tubular holder for a whip usually mounted on the dashboard or to the right of the driver.
* Whip: A long whip composed of a stiff stick (called the &quot;stock&quot;), a long flexible thong, and a short lash. The length should be appropriate for the distance from the driver (who is also called a &quot;Whip&quot;) to the shoulder of the forwardmost horse. With a small pony and cart a whip of overall length of 7 or 8 feet might be appropriate, whereas driving a team of four horses might require an overall length of 17 feet. Driving whips are not &quot;cracked&quot; to make noise, but are a communication aid used by touching the lash on or near the shoulder of the horse.
* Blankets: in cold weather, blankets for the driver and passengers and often horse blankets as well may be carried in a boot.

== Carriage terminology ==

The carriage driver is called a &quot;whip&quot;. A person whose business was to drive a carriage was a &quot;coachman&quot;. A person dressed in livery is called a &quot;footman&quot;. An attendant on horseback called an &quot;outrider&quot;. A &quot;carriage starter&quot; directed the flow of vehicles taking on passengers at the curbside. A &quot;hackneyman&quot; hired out horses and carriages.

Upper-class people of wealth and social position, those wealthy enough to keep carriages, were referred to as &quot;carriage folk&quot; or &quot;carriage trade&quot;.

Carriage passengers often used a &quot;lap robe&quot; as a blanket or similar covering for their legs, lap and feet.

A horse especially bred for carriage use by appearance and stylish action is called a &quot;carriage horse&quot;; one for use on a road is a &quot;road horse&quot;. One such breed is the &quot;Cleveland Bay&quot;, uniformly bay in color, of good conformation and strong constitution. Horses were broken in using a bodiless carriage frame called a &quot;break&quot; or &quot;brake&quot;.

A &quot;carriage dog&quot; or &quot;coach dog&quot; is bred for running beside a carriage.

A roofed structure that extends from the entrance of a building over an adjacent driveway and that shelters callers as they get in or out of their vehicles is known as a &quot;carriage porch&quot; or &quot;porte cochere&quot;. An outbuilding for a carriage is a &quot;coach house&quot;, which was often combined with accommodation for a groom or other servants.

A &quot;livery stable&quot; kept horses and usually carriages for hire. A range of stables, usually with &quot;carriage houses&quot; (&quot;remises&quot;) and living quarters built around a yard, court or street, is called a &quot;mews&quot;.

A kind of dynamometer called a &quot;peirameter&quot; indicates the power necessary to haul a carriage over a road or track.

==Competitive driving==

Driving is a competitive equestrian sport. Many horse shows have driving competitions for a particular style of driving, breed of horse, or type of vehicle. Show vehicles are usually carriages, carts, or buggies and, occasionally, sulkies or wagons. Modern high-technology carriages are made purely for competition, often called marathon carriages.

Internationally, there is intense competition in the all-round test of driving called combined driving or horse-driving trials, an equestrian discipline regulated by the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI) with national organizations representing each member country. World championships are conducted in alternate years, including single-horse, horse pairs and four-in-hand championships. The World Equestrian Games, held at four-year intervals, also includes a four-in-hand competition. For pony drivers, the World Combined Pony Championships are held every two years and include singles, pairs and four-in-hand events.

==Types of horse-drawn carriages==

Numerous varieties of horse-drawn carriages existed, Arthur Ingram&#x27;s &quot;Horse Drawn Vehicles since 1760 in Colour&quot; lists 325 types with a short description of each. By the early 19th century one&#x27;s choice of carriage was only in part based on practicality and performance; it was also a status statement and subject to changing fashions.

<text>A royal court, often called simply a court when the royal context is clear, is an extended royal household in a monarchy, including all those who regularly attend on a monarch, or another central figure. Hence, the word &quot;court&quot; may also be applied to the of a senior member of the nobility. Royal courts may have their seat in a designated place, several specific places, or be a mobile, itinerant court.

In the largest courts, the royal households, many thousands of individuals constituted the court. These courtiers included the monarch or noble&#x27;s camarilla and retinue, household, nobility, clergy, those with court appointments, bodyguards, and may also include emissaries from other kingdoms or visitors to the court. Foreign princes and foreign nobility in exile may also seek refuge at a court.

Near Eastern and Far Eastern courts often included the harem and concubines as well as eunuchs who fulfilled a variety of functions. At times, the harem was walled off and separate from the rest of the residence of the monarch. In Asia, concubines were often a more visible part of the court. Lower ranking servants and bodyguards were not properly called courtiers, though they might be included as part of the court or royal household in the broadest definition. Entertainers and others may have been counted as part of the court.

==Patronage and courtly culture==

A royal household is the highest-ranking example of patronage. A regent or viceroy may hold court during the minority or absence of the hereditary ruler, and even an elected head of state may develop a court-like entourage of unofficial, personally-chosen advisers and &quot;companions&quot;. The French word &quot;compagnon&quot; and its English derivation &quot;companion&quot; literally mean a &quot;sharer of the bread&quot; at table, and a court is an extension of the great individual&#x27;s household. Wherever members of the household and bureaucrats of the administration overlap in personnel, it is reasonable to speak of a &quot;court&quot;, for example in Achaemenid Persia, Ming China, Norman Sicily, the papacy before 1870 (see: papal household), and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. A group of individuals dependent on the patronage of a great man, classically in ancient Rome, forms part of the system of &quot;clientage&quot; that is discussed under vassal.

Individual rulers differed greatly in tastes and interests, as well as in political skills and in constitutional situations. Accordingly, some founded elaborate courts based on new palaces, only to have their successors retreat to remote castles or to practical administrative centers. Personal retreats might arise far away from official court centres.

Etiquette and hierarchy flourish in highly structured court settings, and may leave conservative traces over generations. Most courts featured a strict order of precedence, often involving imperial, royal and noble ranks, orders of chivalry, and nobility. Some courts even featured court uniforms. One of the major markers of a court is ceremony. Most monarchal courts included ceremonies concerning the investiture or coronation of the monarch and audiences with the monarch. Some courts had ceremonies around the waking and the sleeping of the monarch, called a levée. Orders of chivalry as honorific orders became an important part of court culture starting in the 15th century. They were the right of the monarch, as the fount of honour, to create and grant.

==History==

===Early history===
The earliest developed courts were probably in the Akkadian Empire, Ancient Egypt, and Shang dynasty. However, there is evidence of courts as described in the Neo-Assyrian Empire and Zhou dynasty. Two of the earliest titles referring to the concept of a courtier were likely the &quot;ša rēsi&quot; and &quot;mazzāz pāni&quot; of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. In Ancient Egypt, there is a title translated as high steward or great overseer of the house. The royal courts influenced by the court of the Neo-Assyrian Empire such as those of the Median Empire and the Achaemenid Empire would also have identifiable developed courts with court appointments and other features associated with later courts.
The imperial court of the Achaemenid Empire at Persepolis and Pasargadae is the earliest identifiable complex court with all of the definitive features of a royal court such as a household, court appointments, courtiers, and court ceremony. Though Alexander the Great had an entourage and the rudimentary elements of a court, it was not until after he conquered Persia that he took many of the more complex Achaemenid court customs back to the Kingdom of Macedonia, developing a royal court that would later influence the courts of Hellenistic Greece and the Roman Empire.

The Sasanian Empire adopting and developing the earlier court culture and customs of the Achaemenid Empire would also influence again the development of the complex court and court customs of the Roman Empire and Byzantine Empire.

The imperial court of the Byzantine Empire at Constantinople would eventually contain at least a thousand courtiers. The court&#x27;s systems became prevalent in other courts such as those in the Balkan states, the Ottoman Empire, and Russia. Byzantinism is a term that was coined for this spread of the Byzantine system in the 19th century.
===East Asia===
The imperial courts of Chinese emperors, known as (), were among the largest and most complex of all. The Han dynasty, Western Jin dynasty, and Tang dynasty occupied the large palace complex at Weiyang Palace located near Chang&#x27;an, and the later Ming dynasty and Qing dynasty occupied the whole Forbidden City and other parts of Beijing, the present capital city of China. By the Sui dynasty, the functions of the imperial household and the imperial government were clearly divided.

During the Heian period, Japanese emperors and their families developed an exquisitely refined court that played an important role in their culture.

===Medieval and modern Europe===
After the collapse of the Roman Empire in the West, a true court culture can be recognised in the entourage of the Ostrogoth Theodoric the Great and in the court of Charlemagne. In the Roman East, a brilliant court continued to surround the Byzantine emperors.

In Western Europe, consolidation of power of local magnates and of kings in fixed administrative centres from the mid-13th century led to the creation of a distinct court culture that was the centre of intellectual and artistic patronage rivaling the abbots and bishops, in addition to its role as the apex of a rudimentary political bureaucracy that rivaled the courts of counts and dukes. The dynamics of hierarchy welded the court cultures together. Many early courts in Western Europe were itinerant courts that traveled from place to place.

Local courts proliferated in the splintered polities of medieval Europe and remained in early modern times in Germany and in Italy. Such courts became known for intrigue and power politics; some also gained prominence as centres and collective patrons of art and culture. In medieval Spain (Castile), provincial courts were created. Minor noblemen and &quot;burguesie&quot; allied to create a system to oppose the monarchy on many policy issues. They were called &quot;las Cortes de Castilla&quot;. These courts are the root of the current Spanish congress and senate.

The courts of Valois Burgundy and the Kingdom of Portugal were particularly influential over the development of court culture and pageantry in Europe. The court of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy was considered one of the most splendid in Europe and would influence the development of court life later on for all of France and Europe. Later, Aliénor de Poitiers of the Burgundian court would write one of the seminal books on court etiquette, &quot;Les honneurs de la cour&quot; (&quot;Honours of the Court&quot;).

Court life would reach its apogee of culture, complexity and etiquette at the courts of Versailles under Louis XIV of France and the Hofburg under the Habsburgs.

As political executive functions are assumed by democratic or republican institutions, the function of noble courts is reduced once more to that of noble households, concentrating on personal service to the household head, ceremonial and perhaps some residual politico-advisory functions. If republican zeal has banished an area&#x27;s erstwhile ruling nobility, courts may survive in exile. Traces of royal court practices remain in present-day institutions like privy councils and governmental cabinets.

===Africa===
A series of Pharaohs ruled Ancient Egypt over the course of three millennia ( to 31 BC), until it was conquered by the Roman Empire. In the same time period several kingdoms with their own royal courts flourished in the nearby Nubia region, with at least one of them, that of the so-called A-Group culture, apparently influencing the customs of Egypt itself. From the 6th to 19th centuries, Egypt was variously part of the Byzantine Empire, Islamic Empire, Mamluk Sultanate, Ottoman Empire and British Empire with a distant monarch. The Sultanate of Egypt was a short lived protectorate of the United Kingdom from 1914 until 1922, when it became the Kingdom of Egypt and Sultan Fuad I changed his title to King. After the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 the monarchy was dissolved and Egypt became a republic.

In the Horn of Africa, the Kingdom of Aksum and later the Zagwe dynasty, Ethiopian Empire (1270–1974), and Aussa Sultanate all had royal courts. Various Somali Sultanates also existed, including the Adal Sultanate (led by the Walashma dynasty of the Ifat Sultanate), Sultanate of Mogadishu, Ajuran Sultanate, Warsangali Sultanate, Geledi Sultanate, Majeerteen Sultanate and Sultanate of Hobyo.

The kingship system has been an integral part of the more centralised African societies for millennia. This is especially true in the West African sahel, where royal courts have been in existence since at least the era of the 9th century Takrur and Ghana empires. The ruler of the 13th century Mali empire, Mansa Musa, brought a large number of his courtiers with him on the Islamic Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. Today, the courts of the Ashanti nanas in modern Ghana, the Mande members of the Tunkalemmu caste in Mali, the Bamum sultans of Cameroon, the Kanem shaykhs of Chad, the Hausa emirs of northern Nigeria, the inkosis of the Southern African Zulus and Xhosas, and the obas and baales of Yorubaland, amongst others, continue the pageantry and court lifestyle traditions once common to the continent.

==Court structure and organization==
===Court officials===

Court officials or office-bearers (one type of courtier) derived their positions and retained their titles from their original duties within the courtly household. With time, such duties often became archaic. However, titles survived involving the ghosts of arcane duties. These styles generally dated back to the days when a noble household had practical and mundane concerns as well as high politics and culture. Such court appointments each have their own histories. They might include but are not limited to:

===Court seats===
Earlier courts in medieval Western Europe were itinerant courts, but courts were often held in a fixed place. One of the criteria of Norbert Elias&#x27; concept of a court society is that it existed in space. The German word &quot;Hof&quot;, meaning an enclosed courtyard, can also apply to a rural farmstead with outbuildings and walls forming the perimeter. It has also been used for the palatial seat where the court was held. Thus &quot;Hof&quot; or &quot;court&quot; can become transferred to the building itself. For example, the grand residence Hampton Court Palace on the River Thames above London was where Thomas Wolsey held court as Catholic cardinal (built after the Italian ideal for a cardinal&#x27;s palace) until his fall and its confiscation by Henry VIII. William III and Mary II also held court there, 1689–94. Though it is built round two main courts, the structure itself is no longer the seat of a court in the sense of this article.

As an example, ambassadors to the United Kingdom are still accredited to the Court of St. James&#x27;s, and courtiers of the monarchy may still have offices in St James&#x27;s Palace, London. The present monarch, however, holds court at Buckingham Palace, where dignitaries are received.

===Caliphate courts===
All four major Caliphates had sophisticated courts; this enabled Cordoba, Cairo and Baghdad (the respective seats of the Omayyad, the Fatimid and the Abbasid) to become the largest, most culturally developed cities of their time. This drew talented people from all walks of life—such as musicians, singers, poets and scientists—to seek employment under the patronage of elite bureaucrats, emirs and Sultans at court. The other Caliphate was the Ottoman, which employed its court&#x27;s culture to stabilize an empire inhabited by huge non-Islamic populations spanning three continents. Everything from Algeria to the Balkans to Yemen was controlled by the court in Istanbul.

The royal courts in the Islamic world were mostly run by rulers, but there were the exceptions of important elite families such as Barmakids and Nizams who established their own minor courts, enabling them to encourage arts and improve the empire even if the ruling king was useless.

<text>In sociology, popularity is how much a person, idea, place, item or other concept is either liked or accorded status by other people. Liking can be due to reciprocal liking, interpersonal attraction, and similar factors. Social status can be due to dominance, superiority, and similar factors. For example, a kind person may be considered likable and therefore more popular than another person, and a wealthy person may be considered superior and therefore more popular than another person.

There are two primary types of interpersonal popularity: perceived and sociometric. Perceived popularity is measured by asking people who the most popular or socially important people in their social group are. Sociometric popularity is measured by objectively measuring the number of connections a person has to others in the group. A person can have high perceived popularity without having high sociometric popularity, and &quot;vice versa&quot;.

According to psychologist Tessa Lansu at the Radboud University Nijmegen, &quot;Popularity [has] to do with being the middle point of a group and having influence on it.&quot;

== Introduction ==
The term &quot;popularity&quot; is borrowed from the Latin term &quot;popularis&quot;, which originally meant &quot;common.&quot; The current definition of the word popular, the &quot;fact or condition of being well liked by the people&quot;, was first seen in 1601.

While popularity is a trait often ascribed to an individual, it is an inherently social phenomenon and thus can only be understood in the context of groups of people. Popularity is a collective perception, and individuals report the consensus of a group&#x27;s feelings towards an individual or object when rating popularity. It takes a group of people to like something, so the more that people advocate for something or claim that someone is best liked, the more attention it will get, and the more popular it will be deemed.

Notwithstanding the above, popularity as a concept can be applied, assigned, or directed towards objects such as songs, movies, websites, activities, soaps, foods etc. Together, these objects collectively make up popular culture, or the consensus of mainstream preferences in society. In essence, anything, human or non-human, can be deemed popular.

== Types of interpersonal popularity ==

For many years, popularity research focused on a definition of popularity that was based on being &quot;well liked.&quot; Eventually, it was discovered that those who are &quot;perceived&quot; as popular are not necessarily the most well liked as originally assumed. When students are given the opportunity to freely elect those they like most and those they perceive as popular, a discrepancy often emerges. This is evidence that there are two main forms of personal popularity that social psychology recognizes, sociometric popularity and perceived popularity. Prinstein distinguishes between the two types as &quot;likeability&quot; vs. &quot;social status&quot;.

===Sociometric popularity or likeability===
Sociometric popularity can be defined by how liked an individual is. This &quot;liking&quot; is correlated with prosocial behaviours. Those who act in prosocial ways are likely to be deemed sociometrically popular. Often they are known for their interpersonal abilities, their empathy for others, and their willingness to cooperate non-aggressively. This is a more private judgement, characterized by likability, that will not generally be shared in a group setting. Often, it is impossible to know whom individuals find popular on this scale unless confidentiality is ensured.

=== Perceived popularity or social status ===
Perceived popularity is used to describe those individuals who are known among their peers as being popular. Unlike sociometric popularity, perceived popularity is often associated with aggression and dominance and is not dependent on prosocial behaviors. This form of popularity is often explored by the popular media. Notable works dealing with perceived popularity include &quot;Mean Girls&quot;, &quot;Odd Girl Out&quot;, and &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;. Individuals who have perceived popularity are often highly socially visible and frequently emulated but rarely liked. Since perceived popularity is a measure of visible reputation and emulation, this form of popularity is most openly discussed, agreed upon within a group, and what most people refer to when they call someone popular.

==Comprehensive theories==

To date, only one comprehensive theory of interpersonal popularity has been proposed: that of A. L. Freedman in the book &quot;Popularity Explained&quot;. The 3 Factor Model proposed attempts to reconcile the two concepts of sociometric and perceived popularity by combining them orthogonally and providing distinct definitions for each. In doing so, it reconciles the counter intuitive fact that liking does not guarantee perceived popularity nor does perceived popularity guarantee being well liked.

===&quot;Popularity Explained&quot;===
&quot;Popularity Explained&quot; was first published as a blog before being converted to a book and various versions have been available online since 2013.

====Conceptual foundations====
There are four primary concepts that &quot;Popularity Explained&quot; relies on.

# Liking and attraction are not the same. The interpersonal feeling of &quot;liking&quot; is not the same as &quot;attraction&quot; and that both are responsible for different human behaviours. The neurological evidence of this comes from the research of Kent C. Berridge and his incentive salience model. &quot;Popularity Explained&quot; extrapolates the conclusions of this research and applies it to human-human interpersonal interactions.
# A hierarchy of interpersonal attraction exists in all social groups. &quot;Popularity Explained&quot; develops a very broad definition of interpersonal attraction asserting that it is based on a multitude of different factors but primarily those of: socioeconomic status; interpersonal similarity; physical appearance; and efficacy. It proposes the concept of a &quot;Hierarchy of Attraction&quot; which, in simple terms, is just a stylized bell curve that illustrates how attractive people are relative to each other in terms of a percentile.
# Interpersonal attraction (in the broadest sense) results in Input of Energy. Input of Energy is the interpersonal actions that an individual takes, consciously and unconsciously, when they experience an interpersonal attraction. Examples of Input of Energy given in the book include: attempts at physical proximity; changes in verbal communications; changes to non-verbal communication; biased interpersonal judgments; cognitive intrusion; and helping behaviour.
# Sociometric and perceived popularity are correlated but not equivalent. By combining these two concepts, &quot;Popularity Explained&quot; defines eight prototypical student types that can be plotted on the single graph.

====Three-factor model====

According to Freedman, an individual&#x27;s place in the social landscape is determined by a combination of three factors: &quot;what&quot; they are; &quot;who&quot; they are; and the situation.

# &quot;What&quot; refers to all those aspects of a person that are objective: participation in sports, physical appearance, etc. Perceived popularity is primarily the result of what a person is. It is mediated by Input of Energy combining with the Hierarchy of Attraction. This preferential receipt of Input of Energy by a select few is what propels them to the &quot;popular&quot; side of the graph that combines sociometric and perceived popularity.
# &quot;Who&quot; refers to the personality of the individual and how they treat other people. It is this factor that is responsible for determining where a student sits along the &quot;liking&quot; and &quot;disliking&quot; dimensions that characterize a student. The more pro-social an individual, the more they will be liked.
# The Situation refers to the circumstances that an individual finds themself in. Different circumstances may result in different social outcomes. For example, the same student may be perceived as popular when in the social context of their church youth group but unpopular within the social context of their school as a whole.

=== Popularization vs. Personalization ===

The Volume-Control Model offers analytical framework to understand how popularity is used to gain political and economic power. This model explains the way information is organized and selected based on its popularity among users. It links between information popularization and the opposite mechanism, information personalization. Both popularization and personalization are employed together by tech companies, organizations, governments or individuals as complementing mechanisms to gain economic, political, and social power. Among the social implications of information popularization is the emergence of homogeneity, which often reflects dominant views. An example would be the bias of search engines. While Google Images uses PageRank to organize results based on their popularity, it presents mainly white young females as a result for the query &quot;beauty&quot;.

== Interpersonal causes ==
One of the most widely agreed upon theories about what leads to an increased level of popularity for an individual is the perceived value which that individual brings to the group. This seems to be true for members of all groups, but is especially demonstrable in groups that exist for a specific purpose. For example, sports teams exist with the goal of being successful in competitions against other sports teams. Study groups exist so that the members of the group can mutually benefit from one another&#x27;s academic knowledge. In these situations, leaders often emerge because other members of the group perceive them as adding a lot of value to the group as a whole. On a sports team, this means that the best players are usually elected captain and in study groups people might be more inclined to like an individual who has a lot of knowledge to share. It has been argued that this may be a result of our evolutionary tendencies to favor individuals who are most likely to aid in our own survival.

The actual value which an individual brings to a group is not of consequence in determining his or her popularity; the only thing that is important is his or her value as perceived by the other members of the group. While perceived value and actual value may often overlap, this is not a requisite and it has been shown that there are instances in which an individual&#x27;s actual value is relatively low, but they are perceived as highly valuable nevertheless.

=== Attractiveness ===
Attractiveness, specifically physical attractiveness, has been shown to have very profound effects on popularity. People who are physically attractive are more likely to be thought of as possessing positive traits. People who are attractive are expected to perform better on tasks and are more likely to be trusted. Additionally, they are judged to possess many other positive traits such as mental health, intelligence, social awareness, and dominance.

Additionally, people who are of above average attractiveness are assumed to also be of above average value to the group. Research shows that attractive people are often perceived to have many positive traits based on nothing other than their looks, regardless of how accurate these perceptions are. This phenomenon is known as the Halo effect This means that, in addition to being more well-liked, attractive people are more likely to be seen as bringing actual value to the group, even when they may be of little or no value at all. In essence, physically attractive people are given the benefit of the doubt while less attractive individuals must prove that they are bringing value to the group. It has been shown empirically that being physically attractive is correlated with both sociometric and perceived popularity. Some possible explanations for this include increased social visibility and an increased level of tolerance for aggressive, social interactions that may increase perceived popularity.

=== Aggression ===
The degree to which an individual is perceived as popular is often highly correlated with the level of aggression with which that individual interacts with his or her peers. There are two main categories of aggression, relational and overt, both of which have varying consequences for popularity depending on several factors, such as the gender and attractiveness of the aggressor.

The relationship also depends on culture. Prinstein notes that studies have found that increased aggression tends to correlate with higher social status in the United States, but lower social status in China.

==== Relational aggression ====
Relational aggression is nonviolent aggression that is emotionally damaging to another individual. Examples of relationally aggressive activities include ignoring or excluding an individual from a group, delivering personal insults to another person, and the spreading of rumors. Relational aggression is more frequently used by females than males.

It has been found that relational aggression almost always has a strongly negative relationship with sociometric popularity but can have a positive relationship with perceived popularity depending on the perceived level of attractiveness of the aggressor. For an aggressor who is perceived as unattractive, relational aggression, by both males and females, leads to less perceived popularity. For an attractive aggressor however, relational aggression has been found to actually have a positive relationship with perceived popularity.

The relationship between attractiveness and aggression is further intertwined by the finding that increased levels of physical attractiveness actually further decreased the sociometric popularity of relationally aggressive individuals.

In short, the more physically attractive an individual is, the more likely they are to experience decreased levels of sociometric popularity but increased levels of perceived popularity for engaging in relationally aggressive activities.

==== Overt aggression ====
Overt aggression is aggression that involves individuals physically interacting with each other in acts such as pushing, hitting, kicking or otherwise causing physical harm or submission in the other person. This includes threats of violence and physical intimidation as well.

It has been shown that overt aggression directly leads to perceived popularity when the aggressor is attractive. Experiments that are controlled for levels of physical attractiveness show that individuals who are attractive and overtly aggressive have a higher degree of perceived popularity than attractive non-overtly aggressive individuals. This was found to be true to a small degree for females and a large degree for males.

Attractive individuals who are overtly aggressive barely suffer any consequences in terms of sociometric popularity. This is a key difference between overt and relational aggression because relational aggression has a strongly negative relationship on sociometric popularity, especially for attractive individuals. For unattractive individuals, there is again a strongly negative relationship between overt aggression and sociometric popularity. This means that attractive individuals stand to gain a lot of perceived popularity at the cost of very little sociometric popularity by being overtly aggressive while unattractive individuals stand to gain very little perceived popularity from acts of overt aggression but will be heavily penalized with regards to sociometric popularity.

=== Cultural factors ===
According to Talcott Parsons, as rewritten by Fons Trompenaars, there are four main types of culture, marked by:
* love/hate (Middle East, Mediterranean, Latin America);
* approval/criticism (United Kingdom, Canada, Scandinavia, Germanic countries);
* esteem/contempt (Japan, Eastern Asia); and
* responsiveness/rejection (the United States).

Only the responsiveness/rejection culture results in teenagers actively trying to become popular. There is no effort for popularity in Northern or Southern Europe, Latin America or Asia. This emotional bonding is specific for the high schools in the United States. In the love/hate cultures, the family and close friends are more important than popularity. In the approval/criticism cultures, actions are more important than persons, so no strong links develop during school.

=== Demographic differences ===

==== Maturity ====
Popularity is gauged primarily through social status. Because of the importance of social status, peers play the primary role in social decision making so that individuals can increase the chances that others like them. However, as children, individuals tend to do this through friendship, academics, and interpersonal conduct. By adulthood, work and romantic relationships become much more important. This peer functioning and gaining popularity is a key player in increasing interest in social networks and groups in the workplace. To succeed in such a work environment, adults then place popularity as a higher priority than any other goal, even romance.

==== Gender ====
These two types of popularity, perceived popularity and sociometric popularity, are more correlated for girls than they are for boys. However, it is said that men can possess these qualities to a larger extent, making them more likely to be a leader, more powerful, and more central in a group, but also more likely than women to be socially excluded. Boys tend to become popular based on athletic ability, coolness, toughness, and interpersonal skills; however, the more popular a boy gets, the worse he tends to do on his academic work. On the other hand, this negative view of academics is not seen at all in popular girls, who gain popularity based on family background (primarily socioeconomic status), physical appearance, and social ability. Boys are also known to be more competitive and rule focused, whereas girls have more emotional intimacy.

==== Race ====
In some instances, it has been found that in predominantly white high schools, attractive non-white students are on average significantly more sociometrically popular than equally attractive white students. One theory that has been put forth to explain this phenomenon is a high degree of group cohesiveness among minority students compared with the relative lack of cohesion amongst members of the majority. Since there is more cohesion, there is more availability for one person to be liked by many since they are all in contact. This acts like Zipf&#x27;s Law, where the cohesion is a confounding factor that forces the greater links in the smaller minority, causing them to be more noticed and thus more popular. When considering race as a predictor for perceived popularity by asking a class how popular and important each other person is, African American students were rated most popular by their peers. Popularity in race was found to be correlated with athleticism, and because African Americans have a stereotype of being better at sports than individuals of other races, they are viewed as more popular. Additionally, White and Hispanic children were rated as more popular the better they succeeded in school and came from a higher socioeconomic background. No single factor can explain popularity, but instead the interaction between many factors such as race and athleticism vs. academics.

== Effects of popularity in the workplace ==

=== Importance ===
More tasks in the workplace are being done in teams, leading to a greater need of people to seek and feel social approval. In academic settings, a high social standing among peers is associated with positive academic outcomes. Popularity also leads to students in academic environments to receive more help, have more positive relationships and stereotypes, and be more approached by peers. While this is the research found in schools, it is likely to be generalized to a workplace.

=== Benefits ===
Popularity is positively linked to job satisfaction, individual job performance, and group performance. The popular worker, besides just feeling more satisfied with his job, feels more secure, believes he has better working conditions, trusts his supervisor, and possesses more positive opportunities for communication with both management and co-workers, causing a greater feeling of responsibility and belongingness at work. Others prefer to work with popular individuals, most notably in manual labor jobs because, although they might not be the most knowledgeable for the job, they are approachable, willing to help, cooperative in group work, and are more likely to treat their coworkers as an equal. If an employee feels good-natured, genial, but not overly independent, more people will say that they most prefer to work with that employee.

=== Contributing factors ===
According to the mere-exposure effect, employees in more central positions that must relate to many others throughout the day, such as a manager, are more likely to be considered popular.
There are many characteristics that contribute to popularity:
* Expressing and acting in genuine ways – others will turn away if they can detect that someone is being fake to them
* Focusing on positive energy – others will feel too drained to be around someone if their interactions are not started on a positive note or they don&#x27;t have empathy to share in someone else&#x27;s positive news
* Treating others with respect – others do not like to be around someone if they aren&#x27;t treated equally and acknowledged for their hard work
* Create connections – others are more likely to approach individuals they have strong relationships with; these can be built by talking about more personal issues, attending work gatherings, and communicating outside the office walls
* Patience – turning away too quickly ignores that relationships take time to grow, especially in the busy and stressful environments that work often induces
* Incorporating others – others feel a sense of trust and belongingness when they are asked for help on a project
* Hands-on or servant leader – is a person that will do the work before anyone else, be the first to do the less desirable jobs, and have a positive attitude about it.

=== Leadership popularity ===
With a greater focus on groups in the workplace, it is essential that leaders effectively deal with and mediate groups to avoid clashing. Sometimes a leader does not need to be popular to be effective, but there are a few characteristics that can help a leader be more accepted and better liked by his group. Without group or team cohesiveness, there is no correlation between leadership and popularity; however, when a group is cohesive, the higher up someone is in the leadership hierarchy, the more popular they are for two reasons. First, a cohesive group feels more personal responsibility for their work, thus placing more value on better performance. Cohesive members see leaders as taking a bulk of the work and investing a lot of personal time, so when they see a job&#x27;s value they can ascribe its success to the leader. This greatest contribution principle is perceived as a great asset to the team, and members view the leader more favorably and he gains popularity. Secondly, cohesive groups have well established group values. Leaders can become more popular in these groups by realizing and acting on dominant group values. Supporting group morals and standards leads to high positive valuation from the group, leading to popularity.

== The popularity of objects as a consequence of social influence ==

=== Information cascades ===
Popularity is a term widely applicable to the modern era thanks primarily to social networking technology. Being &quot;liked&quot; has been taken to a completely different level on ubiquitous sites such as Facebook.

Popularity is a social phenomenon but it can also be ascribed to objects that people interact with. Collective attention is the only way to make something popular, and information cascades play a large role in rapid rises in something&#x27;s popularity. Rankings for things in popular culture, like movies and music, often do not reflect the public&#x27;s taste, but rather the taste of the first few buyers because social influence plays a large role in determining what is popular and what is not through an information cascade.

Information cascades have strong influence causing individuals to imitate the actions of others, whether or not they are in agreement. For example, when downloading music, people don&#x27;t decide 100% independently which songs to buy. Often they are influenced by charts depicting which songs are already trending. Since people rely on what those before them do, one can manipulate what becomes popular among the public by manipulating a website&#x27;s download rankings. Experts paid to predict sales often fail but not because they are bad at their jobs; instead, it is because they cannot control the information cascade that ensues after first exposure by consumers. Music is again, an excellent example. Good songs rarely perform poorly on the charts and poor songs rarely perform very well, but there is tremendous variance that still makes predicting the popularity of any one song very difficult.

Experts can determine if a product will sell in the top 50% of related products or not, but it is difficult to be more specific than that. Due to the strong impact that influence plays, this evidence emphasizes the need for marketers. They have a significant opportunity to show their products in the best light, with the most famous people, or being in the media most often. Such constant exposure is a way of gaining more product followers. Marketers can often make the difference between an average product and a popular product. However, since popularity is primarily constructed as a general consensus of a group&#x27;s attitude towards something, word-of-mouth is a more effective way to attract new attention. Websites and blogs start by recommendations from one friend to another, as they move through social networking services. Eventually, when the fad is large enough, the media catches on to the craze. This spreading by word-of-mouth is the social information cascade that allows something to grow in usage and attention throughout a social group until everyone is telling everyone else about it, at which point it is deemed popular.

Individuals also rely on what others say when they know that the information they are given could be completely incorrect. This is known as groupthink. Relying on others to influence one&#x27;s own decisions is a very powerful social influence, but can have negative impacts.

=== Zipf&#x27;s Law ===
The popularity of many different things can be described by Zipf&#x27;s powerlaw, which posits that there is a low frequency of very large quantities and a high frequency of low quantities. This illustrates popularity of many different objects.

For example, there are few very popular websites, but many websites have small followings. This is the result of interest; as many people use e-mail, it is common for sites like Yahoo! to be accessed by large numbers of people; however, a small subset of people would be interested in a blog on a particular video game. In this situation, only Yahoo! would be deemed a popular site by the public. This can additionally be seen in social networking services, such as Facebook. The average number of friends on Facebook is 130, while very few people have large social networks. However, some individuals do have more than 5,000 friends. This reflects that very few people can be extremely well-connected, but many people are somewhat connected. The number of friends a person has, has been a way to determine how popular an individual is, so the small number of people who have an extremely high number of friends is a way of using social networking services, like Facebook, to illustrate how only a few people are deemed popular.
Popular people may not be those who are best liked interpersonally by their peers, but they do receive most of the positive behavior from coworkers when compared to nonpopular workers. This is a result of the differences between sociometric and perceived popularity. When asked who is most popular, employees typically respond based on perceived popularity; however, they really prefer the social interactions with those who are more sociometrically popular. For each individual to ensure that they are consistent with the group&#x27;s popularity consensus, those who are high in perceived popularity are treated with the same positive behaviors as those who are more interpersonally, but privately, liked by specific individuals. Well-liked workers are most likely to get salary increases and promotions, while disliked (unpopular) workers are the first to get their salary cut back or laid off during recessions.

During interactions with others in the work environment, more popular individuals receive more organizational citizenship behavior (helping and courteousness from others) and less counter productive work behavior (rude reactions and withheld information) than those who are considered less popular in the workplace. Coworkers agree with each other on who is and who is not popular and, as a group, treat popular coworkers more favorably. While popularity has proven to be a big determiner of getting more positive feedback and interactions from coworkers, such a quality matters less in organizations where workloads and interdependence is high, such as the medical field.

In many instances, physical appearance has been used as one indicator of popularity. Attractiveness plays a large role in the workplace and physical appearance influences hiring, whether or not the job might benefit from it. For example, some jobs, such as salesperson, benefit from attractiveness when it comes down to the bottom line, but there have been many studies which have shown that, in general, attractiveness is not at all a valid predictor of on-the-job performance. Many individuals have previously thought this was only a phenomenon in the more individualistic cultures of the Western world, but research has shown that attractiveness also plays a role in hiring in collectivist cultures as well. Because of the prevalence of this problem during the hiring process in all cultures, researchers have recommended training a group to ignore such influencers, just like legislation has worked to control for differences in sex, race, and disabilities.

<text>A lie is an assertion that is believed to be false, typically used with the purpose of deceiving or misleading someone. The practice of communicating lies is called lying. A person who communicates a lie may be termed a liar. Lies can be interpreted as deliberately false statements or misleading statements, though not all statements that are literally false are considered lies – metaphors, hyperboles, and other figurative rhetoric are not intended to mislead, while lies are explicitly meant for literal interpretation by their audience. Lies may also serve a variety of instrumental, interpersonal, or psychological functions for the individuals who use them.

Generally, the term &quot;lie&quot; carries a negative connotation, and depending on the context a person who communicates a lie may be subject to social, legal, religious, or criminal sanctions; for instance, perjury, or the act of lying under oath, can result in criminal and civil charges being pressed against the perjurer.

Although people in many cultures believe that deception can be detected by observing nonverbal behaviors (e.g. not making eye contact, fidgeting, stuttering, smiling) research indicates that people overestimate both the significance of such cues and their ability to make accurate judgements about deception. More generally, people&#x27;s ability to make true judgments is affected by biases towards accepting incoming information and interpreting feelings as evidence of truth. People do not always check incoming assertions against their memory.

== Types and associated terms ==
* A &quot;barefaced, bald-faced&quot; or &quot;bold-faced lie&quot; is an impudent, brazen, shameless, flagrant, or audacious lie that is sometimes but not always undisguised and that it is even then not always obvious to those hearing it.
* A &quot;big lie&quot; is one that attempts to trick the victim into believing something major, which will likely be contradicted by some information the victim already possesses, or by their common sense. When the lie is of sufficient magnitude it may succeed, due to the victim&#x27;s reluctance to believe that an untruth on such a grand scale would indeed be concocted.
* A &quot;black lie&quot; is about simple and callous selfishness. They are usually told when others gain nothing, and the sole purpose is either to get oneself out of trouble (reducing harm against oneself), or to gain something one desires (increasing benefits for oneself).
* A &quot;blue lie&quot; is a form of lying that is told purportedly to benefit a collective or &quot;in the name of the collective good&quot;. The origin of the term &quot;blue lie&quot; is possibly from cases where police officers made false statements to protect the police force, or to ensure the success of a legal case against an accused.
* An &quot;April fool&quot; is a lie or hoax told/performed on April Fools&#x27; Day.
* To &quot;bluff&quot; is to pretend to have a capability or intention one does not possess. Bluffing is an act of deception that is rarely seen as immoral when it takes place in the context of a game, such as poker, where this kind of deception is consented to in advance by the players. For instance, gamblers who deceive other players into thinking they have different cards to those they really hold, or athletes who hint that they will move left and then dodge right are not considered to be lying (also known as a feint or juke). In these situations, deception is acceptable and is commonly expected as a tactic.
* &quot;Bullshit&quot; (also &quot;B.S.&quot;, &quot;bullcrap&quot;, &quot;bull&quot;) does not necessarily have to be a complete fabrication. While a lie is related by a speaker who believes what is said is false, bullshit is offered by a speaker who does not care whether what is said is true because the speaker is more concerned with giving the hearer some impression. Thus, bullshit may be either true or false, but demonstrates a lack of concern for the truth that is likely to lead to falsehoods.
* A &quot;cover-up&quot; may be used to deny, defend, or obfuscate a lie, errors, embarrassing actions, or lifestyle, and/or lie(s) made previously. One may deny a lie made on a previous occasion, or alternatively, one may claim that a previous lie was not as egregious as it was. For example, to claim that a premeditated lie was really &quot;only&quot; an emergency lie, or to claim that a self-serving lie was really &quot;only&quot; a white lie or noble lie. This should not be confused with confirmation bias in which the deceiver is deceiving themselves.
* &quot;Defamation&quot; is the communication of a false statement that harms the reputation of an individual person, business, product, group, government, religion, or nation.
* To &quot;deflect&quot; is to avoid the subject that the lie is about, not giving attention to the lie. When attention is given to the subject the lie is based around, deflectors ignore or refuse to respond. Skillful deflectors are passive-aggressive, who when confronted with the subject choose to ignore and not respond.
* &quot;Disinformation&quot; is intentionally false or misleading information that is spread in a calculated way to deceive target audiences.
* An &quot;exaggeration&quot; occurs when the most fundamental aspects of a statement are true, but only to a certain degree. It also is seen as &quot;stretching the truth&quot; or making something appear more powerful, meaningful, or real than it is. Saying that someone devoured most of something when they only ate half is considered an exaggeration. An exaggeration might be easily found to be a hyperbole where a person&#x27;s statement (i.e. in informal speech, such as &quot;He did this one million times already!&quot;) is meant not to be understood literally.
* &quot;Fake news&quot; is supposed to be a type of yellow journalism that consists of deliberate misinformation or hoaxes spread via traditional print and broadcast news media or online social media. Sometimes the term is applied as a deceptive device to deflect attention from uncomfortable truths and facts.
* A &quot;fib&quot; is a lie that is easy to forgive due to its subject being a trivial matter; for example, a child may tell a fib by claiming that the family dog broke a household vase, when the child was the one who broke it.
* &quot;Fraud&quot; refers to the act of inducing another person or people to believe a lie in order to secure material or financial gain for the liar. Depending on the context, fraud may subject the liar to civil or criminal penalties.
* A &quot;gray lie&quot; is told partly to help others and partly to help ourselves. It may vary in the shade of gray, depending on the balance of help and harm. Gray lies are, almost by definition, hard to clarify. For example you can lie to help a friend out of trouble but then gain the reciprocal benefit of them lying for you while those they have harmed in some way lose out.
* A &quot;half-truth&quot; or &quot;partial truth&quot; is a deceptive statement that includes some element of truth. The statement might be partly true, the statement may be totally true, but only part of the whole truth, or it may employ some deceptive element, such as improper punctuation or double meaning, especially if the intent is to deceive, evade, blame, or misrepresent the truth. Partial truths are characterized by malicious intent, and therefore, honest people should not excuse them as containing a &quot;rational kernel.&quot;
*&quot;Confabulation&quot; (or honest lie) may be identified by verbal statements or actions that inaccurately describe the history, background, and present situations. There is generally no intent to misinform and the individual is unaware that their information is false. Because of this, it is not technically a lie at all since, by definition, there must be an intent to deceive for the statement to be considered a lie.
* &quot;Jocose lies&quot; are lies meant in jest, intended to be understood as such by all present parties. Teasing and irony are examples. A more elaborate instance is seen in some storytelling traditions, where the storyteller&#x27;s insistence that the story is the absolute truth, despite all evidence to the contrary (i.e., tall tale), is considered humorous. There is debate about whether these are &quot;real&quot; lies, and different philosophers hold different views. The Crick Crack Club in London arranges a yearly &quot;Grand Lying Contest&quot; with the winner being awarded the coveted &quot;Hodja Cup&quot; (named for the Mulla Nasreddin: &quot;The truth is something I have never spoken.&quot;). The winner in 2010 was Hugh Lupton. In the United States, the Burlington Liars&#x27; Club awards an annual title to the &quot;World Champion Liar.&quot;
* &quot;Lie-to-children&quot; is a phrase that describes a simplified explanation of technical or complex subjects as a teaching method for children and laypeople. While lies-to-children are useful in teaching complex subjects to people who are new to the concepts discussed, they can promote the creation of misconceptions among the people who listen to them. The phrase has been incorporated by academics within the fields of biology, evolution, bioinformatics, and the social sciences. Media use of the term has extended to publications including &quot;The Conversation&quot; and &quot;Forbes&quot;.
* &quot;Lying by omission&quot;, also known as a &quot;continuing misrepresentation&quot; or &quot;quote mining&quot;, occurs when an important fact is left out in order to foster a misconception. Lying by omission includes the failure to correct pre-existing misconceptions. For example, when the seller of a car declares it has been serviced regularly, but does not mention that a fault was reported during the last service, the seller lies by omission. It may be compared to dissimulation. An omission is when a person tells most of the truth, but leaves out a few key facts that therefore, completely obscures the truth.
* &quot;Lying in trade&quot; occurs when the seller of a product or service may advertise untrue facts about the product or service in order to gain sales, especially by competitive advantage. Many countries and states have enacted consumer protection laws intended to combat such fraud.
* A &quot;memory hole&quot; is a mechanism for the alteration or disappearance of inconvenient or embarrassing documents, photographs, transcripts, or other records, such as from a website or other archive, particularly as part of an attempt to give the impression that something never happened.
* &quot;Mutual deceit&quot; is a situation wherein lying is both accepted and expected or that the parties mutually accept the deceit in question. This can be demonstrated in the case of a poker game wherein the strategies rely on deception and bluffing to win.
* A &quot;noble lie&quot;, which also could be called a strategic untruth, is one that normally would cause discord if uncovered, but offers some benefit to the liar and assists in an orderly society, therefore, potentially being beneficial to others. It is often told to maintain law, order, and safety.
* &quot;Paltering&quot; is the active use of selective truthful statements to mislead.
* &quot;Paternalistic deception&quot; is a lie told because it is believed (possibly incorrectly) that the deceived person will benefit.
* In psychiatry, &quot;pathological lying&quot; (also called compulsive lying, pseudologia fantastica, and mythomania) is a behavior of habitual or compulsive lying. It was first described in the medical literature in 1891 by Anton Delbrueck. Although it is a controversial topic, pathological lying has been defined as &quot;falsification entirely disproportionate to any discernible end in view, may be extensive and very complicated, and may manifest over a period of years or even a lifetime&quot;. The individual may be aware they are lying, or may believe they are telling the truth, being unaware that they are relating fantasies.
* &quot;Perjury&quot; is the act of lying or making verifiably false statements on a material matter under oath or affirmation in court, or in any of various sworn statements in writing. Perjury is a crime, because the witness has sworn to tell the truth, and for the credibility of the court to remain intact, witness testimony must be relied on as truthful.
* A &quot;&quot; is a lie that a politeness standard requires, and that usually is known to be untrue by both parties. Whether such lies are acceptable is heavily dependent on culture. A common polite lie in international etiquette may be to decline invitations because of &quot;scheduling difficulties&quot;, or due to &quot;diplomatic illness&quot;. Similarly, the butler lie is a small lie that usually is sent electronically and is used to terminate conversations or to save face.
* &quot;Puffery&quot; is an exaggerated claim typically found in advertising and publicity announcements, such as &quot;the highest quality at the lowest price&quot;, or &quot;always votes in the best interest of all the people&quot;. Such statements are unlikely to be true – but cannot be proven false and so, do not violate trade laws, especially as the consumer is expected to be able to determine that it is not the absolute truth.
* A &quot;red lie&quot; is about spite and revenge. It is driven by the motive to harm others even at the expense of harming oneself, out of an angry desire for retribution.
* The phrase &quot;speaking with a forked tongue&quot; means to deliberately say one thing and mean another or, to be hypocritical, or act in a duplicitous manner. This phrase was adopted by Americans around the time of the Revolution, and may be found in abundant references from the early nineteenth century – often reporting on American officers who sought to convince the Indigenous peoples of the Americas with whom they negotiated that they &quot;spoke with a straight and not with a forked tongue&quot; (as for example, President Andrew Jackson told members of the Creek Nation in 1829). According to one 1859 account, the proverb that the &quot;white man spoke with a forked tongue&quot; originated in the 1690s, in the descriptions by the indigenous peoples of French colonials in America inviting members of the Iroquois Confederacy to attend a peace conference, but when the Iroquois arrived, the French had set an ambush and proceeded to slaughter and capture the Iroquois.
* A &quot;therapeutic fib&quot; is lying, or bending the truth, in order to avoid increased agitation from a person with dementia. The intent is not to deceive the patient, but rather to help them feel safe and secure in facing an otherwise upsetting situation or fact.
* &quot;Weasel word&quot; is an informal term for words and phrases aimed at creating an impression that a specific or meaningful statement has been made, when in fact only a vague or ambiguous claim has been communicated, enabling the specific meaning to be denied if the statement is challenged. A more formal term is equivocation.
* A &quot;white lie&quot; is a harmless or trivial lie, especially one told in order to be polite or to avoid hurting someone&#x27;s feelings or stopping them from being upset by the truth. A white lie also is considered a lie to be used for greater good (pro-social behavior). It sometimes is used to shield someone from a hurtful or emotionally-damaging truth, especially when not knowing the truth is deemed by the liar as completely harmless. However, white lies can still be harmful as they can foster distrust when used in inappropriate situations.
* &quot;&quot; expresses white lies or half-lies in Russian culture, told without the intention of (maliciously) deceiving, but as a fantasy, suppressing unpleasant parts of the truth.

==Consequences==
The potential consequences of lying are manifold; some in particular are worth considering. Typically lies aim to deceive, so the hearer may acquire a false belief (or at least something that the speaker &quot;believes&quot; to be false). When deception is unsuccessful, a lie may be discovered. The discovery of a lie may discredit other statements by the same speaker, thereby staining that speaker&#x27;s reputation. In some circumstances, it may also negatively affect the social or legal standing of the speaker. Lying in a court of law, for instance, is a criminal offense (perjury).

Hannah Arendt spoke about extraordinary cases in which an entire society is being lied to consistently. She said that the consequences of such lying are &quot;not that you believe the lies, but rather that nobody believes anything any longer. This is because lies, by their very nature, have to be changed, and a lying government has constantly to rewrite its own history. On the receiving end you get not only one liea lie which you could go on for the rest of your daysbut you get a great number of lies, depending on how the political wind blows.&quot;

==Detection==
The question of whether lies can be detected reliably through nonverbal has been the subject of frequent study. While people in many cultures believe that deception can be indicated by behaviors such as looking away, fidgeting, or stammering, this is not supported by research. A 2019 review of research on deception and its detection through nonverbal behavior concludes that people tend to overestimate both the reliability of nonverbal behavior as an indicator of deception, and their ability to make accurate judgements about deception based on nonverbal behavior.

Polygraph &quot;lie detector&quot; machines measure the physiological stress a subject endures in a number of measures while giving statements or answering questions. Spikes in stress indicators are purported to reveal lying. The accuracy of this method is widely disputed. In several well-known cases, application of the technique has been shown to have given incorrect results. Nonetheless, it remains in use in many areas, primarily as a method for eliciting confessions or employment screening. The unreliability of polygraph results is the basis of the exclusion of such evaluations as admissible evidence in many courts, and the technique is generally perceived to be an example of pseudoscience.

A recent study found that composing a lie takes longer than telling the truth and thus, the time taken to answer a question may be used as a method of lie detection. Instant answers with a lie may be proof of a prepared lie. A recommendation provided to resolve that contradiction is to try to surprise the subject and find a midway answer, not too quick, nor too long.

==Ethics==

Utilitarian philosophers have supported lies that achieve good outcomes – white lies. In his 2008 book, &quot;How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time&quot;, Iain King suggested a credible rule on lying was possible, and he defined it as: &quot;Deceive only if you can change behaviour in a way worth more than the trust you would lose, were the deception discovered (whether the deception actually is exposed or not).&quot;

Stanford law professor Deborah L. Rhode articulated three rules she says ethicists generally agree distinguish &quot;white lies&quot; from harmful lies or cheating:
* A disinterested observer would conclude that the benefits outweigh the harms
* There is no alternative
* If everyone in similar circumstances acted similarly, society would be no worse off

Aristotle believed no general rule on lying was possible, because anyone who advocated lying could never be believed, he said. The philosophers St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, and Immanuel Kant, condemned all lying. According to all three, there are no circumstances in which, ethically, one may lie. Even if the &quot;only&quot; way to protect oneself is to lie, it is never ethically permissible to lie even in the face of murder, torture, or any other hardship. Each of these philosophers gave several arguments for the ethical basis against lying, all compatible with each other. Among the more important arguments are:
* Lying is a perversion of the natural faculty of speech, the natural end of which is to communicate the thoughts of the speaker.
* When one lies, one undermines trust in society.

In &quot;Lying&quot;, neuroscientist Sam Harris argues that lying is negative for the liar and the person who is being lied to. To tell lies is to deny others access to reality, and the harm of lying often cannot be anticipated. The ones lied to may fail to solve problems they could have solved only on a basis of good information. To lie also harms oneself, making the liar distrust the person who is being lied to. Liars generally feel badly about their lies and sense a loss of sincerity, authenticity, and integrity. Harris asserts that honesty allows one to have deeper relationships and to bring all dysfunction in one&#x27;s life to the surface.

In &quot;Human, All Too Human&quot;, philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche suggested that those who refrain from lying may do so only because of the difficulty involved in maintaining lies. This is consistent with his general philosophy that divides (or ranks) people according to strength and ability; thus, some people tell the truth only out of weakness.

A study was conducted by the University of Nottingham, released in 2016, which utilized a dice roll test where participants could easily lie to get a bigger payout. The study found that in countries with high prevalence of rule breaking, dishonesty in people in their early 20s was more prevalent.

==Great apes and mother birds==
Possession of the capacity to lie among non-humans has been asserted during language studies with great apes. In one instance, the gorilla Koko, when asked who tore a sink from the wall, pointed to one of her handlers and then laughed.

Deceptive body language, such as feints that mislead as to the intended direction of attack or flight, is observed in many species. A mother bird deceives when she pretends to have a broken wing to divert the attention of a perceived predator – including unwitting humans – from the eggs in her nest, instead to her, as she draws the predator away from the location of the nest, most notably a trait of the killdeer.

==Psychology==
It is asserted that the capacity to lie is a talent human beings possess universally.

The evolutionary theory proposed by Darwin states that only the fittest will survive and by lying, we aim to improve other&#x27;s perception of our social image and status, capability, and desirability in general. Studies have shown that humans begin lying at a mere age of six months, through crying and laughing, to gain attention.

Scientific studies have shown differences in forms of lying across gender. Although men and women lie at equal frequencies, men are more likely to lie in order to please themselves while women are more likely to lie to please others. The presumption is that humans are individuals living in a world of competition and strict social norms, where they are able to use lies and deception to enhance chances of survival and reproduction.

Stereotypically speaking, David Livingstone Smith asserts that men like to exaggerate about their sexual expertise, but shy away from topics that degrade them while women understate their sexual expertise to make themselves more respectable and loyal in the eyes of men and avoid being labelled as a ‘scarlet woman’.

Those with Parkinson&#x27;s disease show difficulties in deceiving others, difficulties that link to prefrontal hypometabolism. This suggests a link between the capacity for dishonesty and integrity of prefrontal functioning.

Pseudologia fantastica is a term applied by psychiatrists to the behavior of habitual or compulsive lying. Mythomania is the condition where there is an excessive or abnormal propensity for lying and exaggerating.

A recent study found that composing a lie takes longer than telling the truth. Or, as Chief Joseph succinctly put it, &quot;It does not require many words to speak the truth.&quot;

Some people who are not convincing liars truly believe they are.

==Religious perspectives==
=== In the Bible ===

The Old Testament and New Testament of the Bible both contain statements that God cannot lie and that lying is immoral (Num. 23:19, Hab. 2:3, Heb. 6:13–18). Nevertheless, there are examples of God deliberately causing enemies to become disorientated and confused, in order to provide victory (2 Thess. 2:11; 1 Kings 22:23; Ezek. 14:9).

Various passages of the Bible feature exchanges that assert lying is immoral and wrong (Prov. 6:16–19; Ps. 5:6), (Lev. 19:11; Prov. 14:5; Prov. 30:6; Zeph. 3:13), (Isa. 28:15; Dan. 11:27), most famously, in the Ten Commandments: &quot;Thou shalt not bear false witness&quot; (Ex. ; Deut. ); Ex. 23:1; Matt. 19:18; Mark 10:19; Luke 18:20 a specific reference to perjury.

Other passages feature descriptive (not prescriptive) exchanges where lying was committed in extreme circumstances involving life and death. Most Christian philosophers might argue that lying is never acceptable, but that even those who are righteous in God&#x27;s eyes sin sometimes. Old Testament accounts of lying include:
* The midwives lied about their inability to kill the Israelite children. (Ex. 1:15–21).
* Rahab lied to the king of Jericho about hiding the Hebrew spies (Josh. 2:4–5) and was not killed with those who were disobedient because of her faith (Heb. 11:31).
* Abraham instructed his wife, Sarah, to mislead the Egyptians and say that she is his sister (Gen. 12:10). Abraham&#x27;s story was strictly true – Sarah was his half sister – but intentionally misleading because it was designed to lead the Egyptians to believe that Sarah was not Abraham&#x27;s wife for Abraham feared that they would kill him in order to take her, for she was very beautiful.

In the New Testament, Jesus refers to the Devil as the father of lies (John 8:44) and Paul commands Christians &quot;Do not lie to one another&quot; (Col. 3:9; cf. Lev. 19:11). In the Day of Judgement, unrepentant liars will be punished in the lake of fire. (Rev. 21:8; 21:27).

=== Augustine&#x27;s taxonomy ===

Augustine of Hippo wrote two books about lying: &quot;On Lying&quot; (&quot;De Mendacio&quot;) and &quot;Against Lying&quot; (&quot;Contra Mendacio&quot;). He describes each book in his later work, &quot;Retractationes&quot;. Based on the location of &quot;De Mendacio&quot; in &quot;Retractationes&quot;, it appears to have been written about AD 395. The first work, &quot;On Lying&quot;, begins: &quot;Magna quæstio est de Mendacio&quot; (&quot;There is a great question about Lying&quot;). From his text, it can be derived that St. Augustine divided lies into eight categories, listed in order of descending severity:
* Lies in religious teaching
* Lies that harm others and help no one
* Lies that harm others and help someone
* Lies told for the pleasure of lying
* Lies told to &quot;please others in smooth discourse&quot;
* Lies that harm no one and that help someone materially
* Lies that harm no one and that help someone spiritually
* Lies that harm no one and that protect someone from &quot;bodily defilement&quot;

Despite distinguishing between lies according to their external severity, Augustine maintains in both treatises that all lies, defined precisely as the external communication of what one does not hold to be internally true, are categorically sinful and therefore, ethically impermissible.

Augustine wrote that lies told in jest, or by someone who believes or opines the lie to be true are not, in fact, lies.

=== In Buddhism ===
The fourth of the five Buddhist precepts involves falsehood spoken or committed to by action. Avoiding other forms of wrong speech are also considered part of this precept, consisting of malicious speech, harsh speech, and gossip. A breach of the precept is considered more serious if the falsehood is motivated by an ulterior motive (rather than, for example, &quot;a small white lie&quot;). The accompanying virtue is being honest and dependable, and involves honesty in work, truthfulness to others, loyalty to superiors, and gratitude to benefactors. In Buddhist texts, this precept is considered most important next to the first precept, because a lying person is regarded to have no shame, and therefore capable of many wrongs. Lying is not only to be avoided because it harms others, but also because it goes against the Buddhist ideal of finding the truth.

The fourth precept includes avoidance of lying and harmful speech. Some modern Buddhist teachers such as Thich Nhat Hanh interpret this to include avoiding spreading false news and uncertain information. Work that involves data manipulation, false advertising, or online scams can also be regarded as violations. Anthropologist reports that among Thai Buddhists, the fourth precept also is seen to be broken when people insinuate, exaggerate, or speak abusively or deceitfully.

=== In Norse paganism ===
In &quot;Gestaþáttr&quot;, one of the sections within the Eddaic poem &quot;Hávamál&quot;, Odin states that it is advisable, when dealing with &quot;a false foe who lies&quot;, to tell lies also.

===In Zoroastrianism===
Zoroaster teaches that there are two powers in the universe; Asha, which is truth, order, and that which is real, and Druj, which is &quot;the Lie&quot;. Later on, the Lie became personified as Angra Mainyu, a figure similar to the Christian Devil, who was portrayed as the eternal opponent of Ahura Mazda (God).

Herodotus, in his mid-fifth-century BC account of Persian residents of the Pontus, reports that Persian youths, from their fifth year to their twentieth year, were instructed in three things – &quot;to ride a horse, to draw a bow, and to speak the Truth&quot;. He further notes that: &quot;The most disgraceful thing in the world [the Persians] think, is to tell a lie; the next worst, to owe a debt: because, among other reasons, the debtor is obliged to tell lies.&quot;

In Achaemenid Persia, the lie, &quot;drauga&quot; (in Avestan: &quot;druj&quot;), is considered to be a cardinal sin and it was punishable by death in some extreme cases. Tablets discovered by archaeologists in the 1930s at the site of Persepolis give us adequate evidence about the love and veneration for the culture of truth during the Achaemenian period. These tablets contain the names of ordinary Persians, mainly traders and warehouse-keepers. According to Stanley Insler of Yale University, as many as 72 names of officials and petty clerks found on these tablets contain the word &quot;truth&quot;. Thus, says Insler, we have &quot;Artapana&quot;, protector of truth, &quot;Artakama&quot;, lover of truth, &quot;Artamanah&quot;, truth-minded, &quot;Artafarnah&quot;, possessing splendour of truth, &quot;Artazusta&quot;, delighting in truth, &quot;Artastuna&quot;, pillar of truth, &quot;Artafrida&quot;, prospering the truth, and &quot;Artahunara&quot;, having nobility of truth.

It was Darius the Great who laid down the &quot;ordinance of good regulations&quot; during his reign. Darius&#x27; testimony about his constant battle against the Lie is found in the Behistun Inscription. He testifies: &quot;I was not a lie-follower, I was not a doer of wrong ... According to righteousness I conducted myself. Neither to the weak or to the powerful did I do wrong. The man who cooperated with my house, him I rewarded well; who so did injury, him I punished well.&quot;

He asks Ahuramazda, God, to protect the country from &quot;a (hostile) army, from famine, from the Lie&quot;.

Darius had his hands full dealing with large-scale rebellion which broke out throughout the empire. After fighting successfully with nine traitors in a year, Darius records his battles against them for posterity and tells us how it was the &quot;Lie&quot; that made them rebel against the empire. At the Behistun inscription, Darius says: &quot;I smote them and took prisoner nine kings. One was Gaumata by name, a Magian; he lied; thus he said: I am Smerdis, the son of Cyrus ... One, Acina by name, an Elamite; he lied; thus he said: I am king in Elam ... One, Nidintu-Bel by name, a Babylonian; he lied; thus he said: I am Nebuchadnezzar, the son of Nabonidus. ... The Lie made them rebellious, so that these men deceived the people.&quot; Then advice to his son Xerxes, who is to succeed him as the great king: &quot;Thou who shalt be king hereafter, protect yourself vigorously from the Lie; the man who shall be a lie-follower, him do thou punish well, if thus thou shall think. May my country be secure!&quot;

<text>Alfredo Binda (11 August 1902 – 19 July 1986) was an Italian road cyclist of the 1920s and 1930s. He was the first to win five editions of the Giro d&#x27;Italia, and a three-time world champion. In addition he won Milan–San Remo twice, and the Tour of Lombardy four times.

Later he would manage the Italian National team. Under him, Fausto Coppi, Gino Bartali and Gastone Nencini all triumphed at the Tour de France.

==Early life==
Binda was born in Cittiglio near Varese but moved to Nice, in southern France as a teenager. He found work with his uncle as an apprentice plasterer, but he and brother Primo spent their free time cycling. He began racing in September 1921, aged 19. He won his first race (though he was subsequently disqualified) and it was clear from the outset that he was immensely gifted as both time trialist and climber.

Binda was a trained trumpet player, and was nicknamed &quot;Trombettiere di Cittiglio&quot; (&quot;The Trumpeter of Cittiglio&quot;).

==Cycling career==
Enticed by a 500 lire King of the Mountains prize on the Ghisallo climb, Binda rode from Nice to Milan in order to compete in the 1924 Tour of Lombardy. He won the prize, finished fourth in the race, and was immediately offered a contract with the Legnano professional team.

The 1925 Giro d&#x27;Italia was to be the last of the legendary &quot;campionissimo&quot; Costante Girardengo. All of Italy hoped he would prevail, and his defeat at the hands of Binda, a 23-year-old Giro debutant, was deeply unpopular. In the event Girardengo resolved to continue racing, and the two of them developed a caustic, deeply personal rivalry. As Girardengo&#x27;s powers waned, Italians looked to Domenico Piemontesi to usurp Binda but, much like everyone else, he was hopelessly out of his depth against the &quot;fuoriclasse&quot;.

In 1929 Girardengo &quot;discovered&quot; a prodigiously strong track rider from Veneto, Learco Guerra. He famously anointed him as his heir apparent, a new &quot;anti-Binda&quot;. Guerra closely resembled Girardengo as a cyclist, and was hugely popular. He enjoyed the support of the Italian Fascist Party, and by extension the press and wider sporting public. Binda, on the other hand, famously declared that he&#x27;d no interest in producing &quot;spettacolo&quot;. Rather he was simply in the business of winning bike races, and each time he defeated Guerra the Italian public&#x27;s antipathy grew. Whilst Guerra was homespun, expansive and open, Binda was perceived as cold and detached, pompous even.

So dominant was he that the Gazzetta dello Sport offered him 22,500 lire to miss the Giro of 1930. Instead, he took part in that year&#x27;s Tour de France, winning two stages. Not until 1932, when he won a third Cycling World Championship in Rome, did the public start to warm to him. By then he had redefined both training and racing methodology, and was arguably the greatest cyclist ever to have lived.

All told he won the Giro a record five times in 1925, 1927, 1928, 1929 and 1933 (1933 was also the first year the Giro held a &quot;King of the Mountains&quot; competition, which Binda won too). Besides the overall victories he won 41 stages (a record only broken in 2003 by Mario Cipollini). In 1927, he won 12 out of 15 stages, and in 1929 he won 8 consecutive stages.

In the World Championships, Binda was also very successful. He won the title three times in 1927, 1930 and 1932 (a record later equalled by Rik Van Steenbergen, Eddy Merckx, Óscar Freire and Peter Sagan). In addition, he placed third in 1929. By the time he retired he had won over 120 races, including the Italian Championships four times.

== Legacy ==
Società Ciclistica Alfredo Binda and the professional women&#x27;s race Trofeo Alfredo Binda-Comune di Cittiglio are named in his honor.

<doc id="229730" wikidata="Q46347" url="?curid=229730" title="Patrick Vieira">
<text>Patrick Paul Vieira (; born 23 June 1976) is a French professional football manager and former player who is the head coach of Serie A club Genoa. He was named in the FIFA 100 of greatest living footballers in 2004. He is regarded as one of the best players of his generation and one of the greatest midfielders in the history of the sport. He is the current head coach of Serie A club Genoa.

Vieira began his playing career at Cannes, where several standout performances garnered him a move to Serie A club AC Milan. In 1996, he relocated to England to join fellow countryman Arsène Wenger at Arsenal for a fee of £3.5 million. During his nine-year stint in the Premier League, Vieira established himself as a dominating box-to-box midfielder, noted for his aggressive and highly competitive style of play, an attitude that also helped him excel as captain of the club from 2002 until his departure in 2005. He helped Arsenal achieve a sustained period of success during his time at the club, where he lifted four FA Cups and three league titles, including one unbeaten. He was named in the Premier League PFA Team of the Year for six consecutive years from 1999 to 2004. He returned to Italy, playing for Juventus, but quickly departed after the club was relegated as punishment for its part in the Calciopoli scandal. He then signed for Inter Milan, where he consecutively won four league titles, before featuring for Manchester City, where he won another FA Cup, before retiring in 2011.

Vieira featured at senior level for much of his international career, representing France over a period of twelve years, where he also spent some time as captain. He played in the final in his nation&#x27;s victorious campaign at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, and featured heavily as the team also won UEFA Euro 2000. He also appeared for France at the 2002 World Cup, Euro 2004, in the side that finished runners-up in the 2006 World Cup, and at Euro 2008, before retiring from international competition in 2010, having made 107 appearances for the side.

Following retirement, Vieira transitioned into coaching and took charge of the academy at Manchester City in 2013. He departed two years later to become manager of Major League Soccer club New York City FC. He subsequently managed Ligue 1 club Nice between 2018 and 2020, Premier League side Crystal Palace between 2021 and 2023, and Ligue 1 club Strasbourg between 2023 and 2024.

==Early life==
Patrick Paul Vieira was born on 23 June 1976 in Dakar, Senegal. Vieira&#x27;s family moved to Dreux, France, when he was eight, and he did not return to Senegal until 2003. His parents divorced when Vieira was young, and he never met his father again. His French citizenship was conferred on him at birth as his grandfather served in the French Army. His surname Vieira, which is Portuguese, is the maiden name of his mother, who is from Cape Verde.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Vieira first played for Tours U19 in the early 90s, before moving to Cannes, where he made his debut at the age of 17, in 1993, and captained the team at just 19 years old. In the summer of 1995, he was signed by Italian Serie A club AC Milan, although he made just five first-team appearances for the club.

===Arsenal===
====First season (1996–97)====
On 10 August 1996, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; reported that Vieira was subject to a move to English club Arsenal, given personal terms with original suitors Ajax were not reached. He joined Arsenal four days later in a £3.5 million move. The peculiarity of Vieira and fellow Frenchman Rémi Garde arriving at the club, coupled with manager Bruce Rioch&#x27;s dismissal before the season had begun, suggested that Arsenal was managed by exterior influence. Vieira later revealed he signed for Arsenal because his compatriot Arsène Wenger was going to be the club&#x27;s next manager: &quot;I am delighted to be joining Arsenal at the same time as Mr Wenger becomes their coach. Being able to speak French to him will make life a lot easier for me.&quot; Wenger was officially in command of managerial affairs at Arsenal by the start of October, but Vieira had already made his mark, coming on as a substitute against Sheffield Wednesday on 16 September 1996; &quot;The Times&quot; described him as a &quot;thinking man&#x27;s Carlton Palmer … who, at last, gives the Arsenal midfield some variety.&quot;
Vieira made his full debut against Middlesbrough at the Riverside Stadium, three days after. He scored his first goal for the club against Derby County on 8 December 1996 – a late equaliser in a 2–2 draw. His performances for Arsenal in the subsequent months made him a fans’ favourite and was lauded as &quot;…the playmaker Arsenal have sought since Paul Davis pulled the strings in the 1991 championship-winning team.&quot; Davis himself noted that in the matches Vieira was suspended during the Christmas period, Arsenal struggled to win. He ended his first season with 38 appearances in total and Arsenal finished in third place, missing out on a spot in the UEFA Champions League via goal difference.

====Two &quot;doubles&quot; (1997–2002)====
Vieira&#x27;s partnership with international teammate Emmanuel Petit the following season was instrumental in helping Arsenal complete a domestic league and cup double. Vieira scored his first goal of the campaign against Manchester United in a 3–2 victory on 9 November 1997. Vieira, however, twisted his knee during the match, and was ruled out from playing for a month. He returned for the trip at Wimbledon on 22 December 1997, which was postponed due to floodlight problems. In a game against Coventry City on 17 January 1998, Vieira received his first red card for using &quot;foul and abusive language&quot; at referee Stephen Lodge. Vieira was again dismissed a month later, this time in a League Cup semi-final against Chelsea, a decision which Wenger described as &quot;absolutely ridiculous.&quot; Towards the finishing straight of the campaign, Vieira helped Arsenal make ground on league leaders Manchester United and his card record had improved, &quot;…with only one booking in the latter stages of the season&quot;. After a successful World Cup campaign with the national team, Vieira had another productive season at Arsenal in 1998–99. Although Arsenal failed to retain the Premier League, Vieira&#x27;s endeavour was rewarded – he was named in the PFA Team of the Year alongside Petit.

Against West Ham United on 2 October 1999, Vieira was sent off for a second booking, after fouling striker Paolo Di Canio. Moments after, he spat at Neil Ruddock, who walked into him and was dragged off the pitch by officials. Vieira was subsequently charged, banned for six matches and fined a record £45,000 by The Football Association. The season ended in disappointment for both Vieira and Arsenal, as the team finished 18 points behind champions Manchester United, in second place. Arsenal reached the 2000 UEFA Cup Final, in which Vieira played. but the team lost the match on penalties against Galatasaray; Vieira&#x27;s spot kick hit the post.

Disciplinary problems continued to beset Vieira in the 2000–01 season. He was sent off on the opening day against Sunderland, and for the second time in 72 hours at home to Liverpool. Vieira scored two goals, the following match against Charlton Athletic, in what was his final appearance before a five-match suspension. It was feared that Vieira was prepared to turn his back on English football, as he felt victimised – Wenger, several Arsenal players and fans supported him publicly. Vieira himself, after the ban, expressed his desire to remain at Arsenal, but noted he could never alter his style of play: &quot;...because, basically, I don&#x27;t want to change. I really enjoy English football and the life in England. I am happy here.&quot;

After a group stage match against Lazio in October 2000, Vieira claimed he was the target of racial abuse from Siniša Mihajlović, which UEFA subsequently launched an investigation into. Mihajlović later admitted he made reference to Vieira&#x27;s ethnicity, but added that he was provoked. The player was then handed a two-match ban for &quot;unsporting actions&quot;. Given Arsenal that finished behind Manchester United in the league for a third consecutive season, Vieira was reluctant to commit himself to the club, and described the season, up until April 2001, as &quot;average&quot;. Despite how mature his performances had become since Petit left, he criticised Arsenal&#x27;s decision to sell him and Marc Overmars to Barcelona: &quot;Of course it was good business but it was a big disappointment for me. If we still had the same team now and put Overmars and Petit in it, we would be even better and stronger. It&#x27;s not that I miss Petit – the team needs him.&quot;

In May 2001, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that Manchester United was planning an &quot;audacious&quot; attempt to sign Vieira; manager Sir Alex Ferguson, a long-term admirer of the player, was given the green light by his board to make a bid. In the summer period, Vieira disparaged Arsenal&#x27;s transfer activity and was adamant the club would not finish &quot;in the top five in the league – and forget the Champions League,&quot; saying about his future: &quot;As far as I&#x27;m concerned, the matter is resolved. I am leaving Arsenal and I have made that perfectly clear.&quot; The club refused to respond to his comments, but vice-chairman David Dein was privately irked at Vieira&#x27;s agent, Marc Roger, for letting the situation become unsettling. Wenger attributed the saga at the hands of Manchester United: &quot;[They] made an approach to Patrick without contacting us, and that does not really respect the rules.&quot; Vieira turned up for pre-season training in July 2001 as normal, and was later named the club vice-captain, to ensure he would succeed Tony Adams as captain. Success finally came for Vieira in the 2001–02 season; Arsenal regained the league and beat Chelsea in the 2002 FA Cup Final to complete a second double.

====Captaincy and &quot;Invincibles&quot; (2002–04)====
Adams&#x27; retirement in May 2002 meant Vieira became club captain. He described the feeling as &quot;daunting&quot;, but it was something he looked forward to: &quot;Taking the responsibility on my shoulders is something I relish. It will make me a better, more mature footballer and a more mature person as well.&quot; Against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in September 2002, Vieira was sent off for a late tackle on Gianfranco Zola; Arsenal&#x27;s persistence nevertheless earnt them a point. In an interview with &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot; soon after, Vieira spoke of his desire to rest, as he felt &quot;burned out&quot;: &quot;I can hardly stand. My back aches, my legs hurt, it hurts all over. I&#x27;m going to see Arsène. He must give me time off to relax.&quot; He featured in 66 games the previous campaign for Arsenal, but Wenger rejected the player&#x27;s need for special treatment: &quot;I looked at the statistics for Tuesday&#x27;s game and, physically, Patrick was outstanding. He pushed himself very hard and that explains why he was so tired.&quot;

Vieira&#x27;s performance against Charlton on 14 September 2002 – incidentally his 200th league appearance for Arsenal – &quot;justified Wenger&#x27;s faith in his captain&#x27;s fitness&quot;. Two months later, he was lauded by &quot;The Guardian&quot; correspondent David Lacey for his show against Newcastle United: &quot;the Arsenal captain dominated the afternoon with a demonstration of tackling, control, awareness and movement that was exceptional even by his standards.&quot; Vieira sustained a groin injury against Valencia in December 2002, returning on Boxing Day to face West Bromwich Albion. In May 2003, Vieira was fined £2,300 by UEFA, having criticised the organisation for not doing enough on racism, as Vieira had been subjected to racist abuse against Valencia. Vieira missed Arsenal&#x27;s title run-in, which saw Manchester United overtake them in first place, due to sustaining a knee injury. Vieira was also ruled out of the 2003 FA Cup Final, which Arsenal won.

In spite of growing interest to sign Vieira, not least from Manchester United, Real Madrid and Chelsea in summer 2003, he agreed to stay at Arsenal and signed a deal that ran until 2007. The 2003–04 season was a successful one for Arsenal, as they reclaimed the league title and became the first English team in more than a century to go through the entire league season unbeaten. Vieira endured a troubling start to the campaign, as he was sent off against Manchester United in September 2003, banned for one match, and later fined £20,000 &quot;for improper conduct in failing to leave the field of play following his sending-off&quot;. He went off with a thigh strain during the match against Newcastle United, which commenced a period of being in and out of the side for two months. He scored his first goal of the season against Chelsea on 21 February 2004; Arsenal afterwards opened up a seven-point gap at the top of the league. Two months later, Vieira scored the opening goal away to Tottenham Hotspur, in what ended a 2–2 draw – enough for Arsenal to regain the title. Against Leicester City in the final league match of the campaign, with the score tied at 1–1, Dennis Bergkamp set up Vieira with a pass, to which he rounded the goalkeeper and scored. Arsenal ended the campaign as league champions without a single defeat – a record of 26 wins and twelve draws.

====Final season (2004–05)====
The re-election of Real Madrid president Florentino Pérez in July 2004 prompted him to declare the club&#x27;s ambition to sign Vieira: &quot;I must repeat that my policy is to try to sign the best player in the world in every position where we do not already have that. Patrick Vieira is, in my opinion, the best in the world in his position.&quot; Vieira&#x27;s advisors met with officials from Real Madrid, before it was speculated a bid of £18 million had been put on the table. Following an ultimatum set by Wenger, who was &quot;likely&quot; to make an offer for West Ham midfielder Michael Carrick as his replacement, Vieira chose to stay at Arsenal. In a statement, he said: &quot;I&#x27;m staying at the club. I&#x27;m proud to be captain of the club and I&#x27;m looking forward to achieving my ambitions.&quot;

Vieira scored his first goal of the 2004–05 season in a nine-goal North London derby, which Arsenal won 5–4 on 13 November 2004. His second goal came in a fortnight at Liverpool, &quot;lift[ing] a lazy, delicate finish away from Chris Kirkland&quot; after a one-touch move. Arsenal lost the match late on and Vieira, booked in the match, was suspended for the December clash against league leaders Chelsea; he scored the only goal for the team against Newcastle in the Christmas period. Vieira was involved in a tunnel bust up with Manchester United captain Roy Keane in February 2005 and was confronted about an incident involving Gary Neville. Arsenal fell to third as a result of losing 4–2 to United, but a twelve-game unbeaten run, culminating in a 7–0 home win against Everton, meant they ended the season in second place. In the 2005 FA Cup Final, he scored the winning penalty in a penalty shoot-out after a 0–0 draw with Manchester United, which proved to be his final kick of a ball for Arsenal. Vieira returned for the opening match of Emirates Stadium, in a testimonial for Bergkamp on 22 July 2006, as one of the Arsenal legends against Ajax.

===Juventus===
In July 2005, representatives of Juventus met with Arsenal with a view to signing Vieira. The player, according to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, accepted that Arsenal were &quot;ready to let him go&quot;, before agreeing in principle to join Juventus. On 15 August 2005, Vieira signed a five-year contract, in a deal worth £13.75 million.

Vieira was reunited with Fabio Capello, who had signed him at Milan, as a teenager. Capello described him as a &quot;very important player&quot;, adding &quot;…his presence is felt not only for his technical value but for his physical quality.&quot; Capello deployed Vieira in a midfield alongside Emerson and Pavel Nedvěd. Vieira made his debut for Juventus in their 1–0 win against Chievo on 28 August 2005. On 14 September 2005, he was sent off against Club Brugge, in Juventus&#x27; first match of the Champions League. Vieira scored his first goal for the club – a 37th-minute winner against Udinese a week after - which contributed towards Juventus&#x27; impressive start to the season. Having picked up a groin injury through international duty for France, Vieira missed Juventus&#x27; Champions League match away to Bayern Munich in October 2005. Despite his performances dipping as the result of a persistent groin injury, and a reported training ground bust-up with teammate Zlatan Ibrahimović, Vieira helped Juventus retain the &quot;Scudetto&quot;, which was later stripped.

In a twist of fate, Vieira returned to Highbury on 28 March 2006 to play against Arsenal in the first leg of the quarter-finals of the Champions League. During that game, he was the subject of a strong tackle by former club and national teammate Robert Pires. Vieira was left crestfallen as Pires regained possession and Arsenal attacked, scoring the first goal of the tie through Cesc Fàbregas. Pires humorously quipped that it was the first time in 13 years he had got the better of Vieira physically. Vieira also received a yellow card during that leg, which Arsenal won 2–0, and was suspended for the return leg on 5 April 2006, which ended 0–0 and eliminated Juventus. Arsenal ended up reaching the Champions League final.

===Inter Milan===
Juventus were stripped of their 2004–05 and 2005–06 titles, after it was revealed they were involved in the Calciopoli scandal. Juventus were relegated to Serie B and deducted 17 points by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) for their involvement, prompting many of the club&#x27;s major stars to move elsewhere. After press speculation linking him to various clubs, including a move back to Arsenal, on 2 August 2006, Vieira officially signed a four-year deal with Inter Milan, in a deal to be worth €9.5 million, less than half of the €20 million fee Juventus had paid just twelve months prior. Vieira declared he wanted to continue to play at the highest level at the presentation conference, which is his reason to leave Juventus.

On his Inter debut on 26 August, Vieira scored twice as the team won 4–3 against Roma in the Supercoppa Italiana at the San Siro. He later won the 2006–07, 2007–08 and 2008–09 Serie A titles - but, due to injury, he failed to become a regular starter. Olivier Dacourt, initially a backup player, became manager Roberto Mancini&#x27;s first choice player in the 2006–07 season. After the club signed Sulley Muntari and Thiago Motta, Vieira became of lesser and lesser importance to the team.

In response to extensive media speculation regarding a possible return by Vieira to his former club in 2009, Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger admitted that he would contemplate re-signing Vieira. The move never happened, however, and Vieira remained at Inter. On 6 January 2010, Vieira was unusually included in the starting lineup against Chievo, which was his eighth league start of the season. Before the match commenced, Inter had lost Esteban Cambiasso and Muntari due to injury, with Dejan Stanković and Motta suspended. José Mourinho stated that Vieira had played his last game at Inter after the match.

===Manchester City===
On 8 January 2010, it was confirmed that Vieira was having a medical at Manchester City, and he would sign a six-month deal, where he would link up with former Arsenal colleagues Kolo Touré and Sylvinho, as well as former Inter manager Roberto Mancini. The contract also included an option for a twelve-month extension. Mancini described Vieira as an excellent midfielder with a winner&#x27;s mentality, and that he would fit into Manchester City&#x27;s squad very well.

He made his debut on 6 February in the 2–1 defeat away to Hull City, replacing Craig Bellamy after an hour. Three days later, he made his first start against Bolton Wanderers, where he assisted Emmanuel Adebayor through a long ball in the 2–0 victory. Later in the month, he was given a three-match retrospective ban for a kick at Stoke City&#x27;s Glenn Whelan. He scored his first goal for the club against Burnley in a 6–1 win on 3 April 2010. On 9 June, Vieira agreed to a one-year extension to his contract, which kept him at Eastlands until the summer of 2011.

On 22 February 2011, Vieira scored the first two City goals in a 5–0 win in the FA Cup Fourth round replay against Notts County, and was awarded Man of the Match honours. He scored in the Premier League on 3 April against Sunderland, a minute after having come on as a substitute for Adam Johnson in the 5–0 win. He made an added-time substitute appearance in place of David Silva on 14 May, as Manchester City won the 2011 FA Cup Final with a 1–0 win over Stoke at Wembley. On 14 July, he retired at the age of 35, immediately becoming a development executive at City.

==International career==
Vieira made his debut for France in 1997 against the Netherlands. He was part of the France squad in the 1998 FIFA World Cup. He came on as a substitute in the final against Brazil, and set up Arsenal teammate Emmanuel Petit for France&#x27;s third goal in a 3–0 win. He, with the rest of the squad, was appointed a Knight of the Legion of Honour in 1998.

He subsequently played as a first choice midfield player in France&#x27;s successful campaign at UEFA Euro 2000, which they won, beating Italy in the final. He helped France to victory in the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup, ending the tournament as joint top scorer with two goals, including the winner, a header, in the final against Japan. He also played in all three games in the 2002 World Cup, in which France were eliminated in the group stage, failing to score a goal.

Vieira was injured and missed France&#x27;s defeat to Greece, the eventual winners, at Euro 2004. After the tournament in Portugal, he became captain upon Zinedine Zidane&#x27;s retirement from international football. In August 2005, he returned the armband as Zidane returned to the team.

On 23 June 2006, his 30th birthday, Vieira took the captain&#x27;s armband for the match in place of the suspended Zidane, and scored the first goal as France beat Togo 2–0 in the group stages of the 2006 World Cup; he also assisted Thierry Henry for the second. This win helped France advance to the knockout stages in second behind Switzerland. In the round of 16, Vieira assisted the equaliser by Franck Ribéry and scored the second goal in a 3–1 win over Spain. Vieira started the final, but was substituted injured for Alou Diarra as Italy won 5–3 on penalties after a 1–1 draw.

On 5 August 2006, Vieira was reappointed captain of the France national team for the Euro 2008 qualifying campaign following Zidane&#x27;s full retirement. He became the fifth Frenchman to earn 100 caps on 15 November, in a 1–0 win over Greece at the Stade de France. He played no part in the group games at Euro 2008 for a struggling France due to a niggling knee injury. His last cap with the national team was on 2 June 2009 in a friendly match against Nigeria, and was not included by coach Raymond Domenech in France&#x27;s squad for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.

On 7 July 2010, Vieira confirmed that he was no longer interested in playing for France and would devote his time to Manchester City. Altogether, he won 107 caps for France, scoring six goals.

==Style of play==
Regarded by pundits as one of the best players ever in his position, Vieira was a complete, powerful, tenacious and aggressive footballer, with outstanding physical, athletic and technical attributes, who was also known for his grace on the pitch when in possession of the ball. Usually deployed as a defensive, central or box-to-box midfielder, he was a competent tackler and a tactically intelligent midfielder, who was known for his ability to anticipate his opponents, and was gifted with good ball skills, distribution and vision, which enabled him to start attacking plays in midfield after winning back possession; he also excelled in the air and was known for his surging forward runs from midfield, which enabled him to contribute to his team&#x27;s offensive play. These attributes, in addition to his pace, strength, pressing ability and stamina allowed him to link up the defence with the attack effectively, and made him capable of playing anywhere in midfield. In 2007, &quot;The Times&quot; placed him at number 33 in their list of the fifty hardest footballers in history. In addition to his abilities as a footballer, he also stood out for his leadership throughout his career.

==Managerial career==
On 14 July 2011, Vieira announced his retirement from playing and accepted a training and youth development role at Premier League club Manchester City, with the title of &quot;Football Development Executive&quot;. In this role, he forged a strong, close working relationship with City Football Group&#x27;s Brian Marwood. In May 2013, Vieira was appointed as the manager of the club&#x27;s new reserve team: the Elite Development Squad (EDS).

In May 2015, Vieira was interviewed to be the next manager of fellow Premier League club Newcastle United, an opportunity which both parties rejected, due to difference of policies.

===New York City FC===
On 9 November 2015, Vieira was announced as the new head coach of New York City FC - who share owners with Manchester City, in the City Football Group - from 1 January 2016, replacing inaugural head coach Jason Kreis. He was selected for the role by Director of Football Claudio Reyna, due to his familiarity with the structure of operations within the group, as well as his tactical knowledge, which was previously utilized by Jason Kreis on his scholar period in Manchester.

Vieira&#x27;s first signing at the club was Jack Harrison, the first pick of the 2016 MLS SuperDraft. He took charge of his first Major League Soccer game on the road versus Chicago Fire on 6 March 2016, in which his squad claimed a 4–3 victory. He led New York City to a 7-0 home defeat to New York Red Bulls on 21 May 2016. Despite losing in the conference semi-finals to Toronto, 2016 was considered a successful first season for Vieira by nearly all pundits.

New York City improved its position in the combined MLS standings in each of his years with the club, improving from 17th in 2015 to fourth in Vieira&#x27;s first season in 2016, and then to second in 2017.

===Nice===
On 11 June 2018, Vieira was appointed as the manager of Ligue 1 side Nice. In his first season in charge, he led the club to a seventh-placed finish in the league, one place ahead of the club&#x27;s position the previous season. Elsewhere in the French domestic circuit, Nice had a disappointing run in the Coupe de France, being eliminated by Toulouse in the round of 64, whereas they were defeated by Guingamp in the round of 16 during their Coupe de la Ligue campaign. On 4 December 2020, Nice announced that Vieira was no longer the manager of the club, after a run of five losses in a row in all competitions, and elimination from the group stage of the Europa League.

===Crystal Palace===
On 4 July 2021, Vieira was appointed as manager of Premier League club Crystal Palace on a three-year contract, following the departure of their previous manager, Roy Hodgson, who had served the club since 2017. He lost 3–0 away to Chelsea on his debut on 14 August. In his first season, he was undefeated against to his two former Premier League teams, managing a 2–2 away draw and 3–0 home win against Arsenal, and a 2–0 away win and 0–0 home draw against Manchester City. He guided the team to a twelfth-place league finish in the 2021–22 Premier League, and reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, losing to Chelsea.

Vieira was involved in an altercation with pitch-invading Everton fans on 19 May 2022 at Goodison Park. Vieira refused to comment on the event, while opposing manager Frank Lampard sympathised with him. Neither Vieira or the fan decided to press charges against the other when they were questioned by Merseyside Police.

Vieira was sacked by the club on 17 March 2023, after a twelve-game run without a win, including a three-game span without a single shot on target, left the team three points above the relegation zone. His last match in charge was a 1–0 away defeat to rivals Brighton &amp; Hove Albion on 15 March. He was replaced by his predecessor Hodgson.

===Strasbourg===
On 2 July 2023, Vieira signed a three-year deal at Ligue 1 club Strasbourg, shortly after their takeover by Chelsea owners BlueCo. His debut on 13 August was a 2–1 home win over Lyon. From 24 September to 7 December, the team went on an eight-game winless run, which fans blamed on a summer transfer window in which four 20-year-olds were signed for a combined fee of €53 million but struggled to perform. His team reached the quarter-finals of the Coupe de France, losing on penalties to Lyon after a goalless draw at the Parc Olympique Lyonnais. Vieira&#x27;s young team struggled on the pitch as fans expressed hostility to the American owners and their business plan of developing new players for Chelsea.

On 18 July 2024, Vieira left the club by mutual agreement.

=== Genoa ===
On 20 November 2024, Vieira was announced as the new head coach of Genoa, following their previous manager Alberto Gilardino being dismissed.

==Style of management==
Vieira has been known for implementing a methodical, possession-based football in all his teams. He has shown a tendency to become more defensive when his side are in a tight spot. His spell at Crystal Palace saw a shift to a proactive style of gameplay from the reactive counterattack-based gameplay prominent under the management of Roy Hodgson.

==Personal life==
Vieira and his Trinidadian wife, Cheryl, first met in England while he was playing for Arsenal. They have a daughter. The family experienced a home invasion in May 2006, when gas was pumped into their home near Cannes, but suffered no long-term effects.

In 2003, Vieira returned to Senegal for the first time since his childhood, to lay the foundation stone of the Diambars football academy in Saly. The academy produced nine of the players in Senegal&#x27;s squad at the 2012 Olympic football tournament.

==Media==
Vieira features in EA Sports &quot;FIFA&quot; video game series; he was on the cover of &quot;FIFA 2005&quot;, and was named in the Ultimate Team Legends in &quot;FIFA 14&quot;.

Vieira was sponsored by sportswear company Nike, and appeared in several Nike commercials. In a global Nike advertising campaign in the run-up to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan, he starred in a &quot;Secret Tournament&quot; commercial (branded &quot;Scorpion KO&quot;) directed by Terry Gilliam, appearing alongside football players such as Thierry Henry, Ronaldo, Edgar Davids, Fabio Cannavaro, Francesco Totti, Ronaldinho, Luís Figo and Hidetoshi Nakata, with former player Eric Cantona the tournament &quot;referee&quot;.

Vieira also worked as a pundit for ITV during their coverage of the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

<text>This page lists examples of the power in watts produced by various sources of energy. They are grouped by [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] from small to large.

== Below 1 W ==

==1 to 102 W==

==103 to 108 W==
The productive capacity of electrical generators operated by utility companies is often measured in MW. Few things can sustain the transfer or consumption of energy on this scale; some of these events or entities include: lightning strikes, naval craft (such as aircraft carriers and submarines), engineering hardware, and some scientific research equipment (such as supercolliders and large lasers).

For reference, about 10,000 100-watt lightbulbs or 5,000 computer systems would be needed to draw 1 MW. Also, 1 MW is approximately 1360 horsepower. Modern high-power diesel-electric locomotives typically have a peak power of 3–5 MW, while a typical modern nuclear power plant produces on the order of 500–2000 MW peak output.

<text>Heathrow Express is a high-frequency airport rail link operating between London Heathrow Airport and . Opened in 1998, trains run non-stop, with a journey time of 15 minutes. The service is operated jointly by Great Western Railway and Heathrow Express Operating Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Heathrow Airport Holdings. Around 16,000 passengers use the service each day.

==History==
===Background===
Heathrow Airport, the main international airport serving London, was connected to the London Underground network in the late 1970s. However the journey to central London on the Piccadilly line takes around 40 to 50 minutes, the same time as a black taxi. In the early 1980s, the quality of public transport to the airport was criticised at public inquiries regarding expansion of the airport, with the inspector noting that &quot;a direct and dedicated ... rail link should be provided&quot;.

During 1986, the Heathrow Surface Access Study recommended a non-stop airport rail link between London and Heathrow Airport. In July 1988, Secretary of State for Transport Paul Channon approved a joint venture between the British Airports Authority (BAA) and British Rail to work on the project, with an opening date of 1993.

In November 1988, a Parliamentary bill was introduced, seeking approval to build the project. The Heathrow Express Railway Act received royal assent in May 1991. In March 1993, government expenditure for the project was approved in the spring budget. BAA would fund 80% of the cost, with British Rail contributing 20%. In August 1993, British Rail and BAA signed the contract to build the line, with an opening date of December 1997. Following the privatisation of British Rail from November 1993, the project was taken over by BAA in 1996.

===Construction===
Construction began in 1993, with an estimated cost of £350 million. The principal works were two single-bore tunnels (including eight escape shafts) and underground stations at and Terminal 4. Electrification of the Great Western Main Line (GWML) between Paddington and Airport Junction, where the new line diverged from the GWML, was also required to achieve a 15-minute journey time. A flying junction known as the Stockley Flyover was constructed to connect the tunnel to the GWML fast lines. As part of the construction of the project, steps were taken to reduce the environmental and visual impact of the railway, including disguising ventilation shafts as barns.

In October 1994, a tunnel collapse occurred during construction that led to the subsidence of a surface building and three large surface craters. The investigation into the collapse led to a six-month delay in opening and additional costs of around £150 million.

=== Opening ===
Beginning in January 1998, an interim service called Heathrow FastTrain ran to a temporary station called Heathrow Junction, where a coach took passengers the rest of the way. Full service between London Paddington, Heathrow Central and Terminal 4 opened on 23 June 1998, with an opening by Prime Minister Tony Blair. The Heathrow Express brand, as well as staff uniforms, train design and station architecture were designed by Wolff Olins.

From 1999 to 2003, a check-in service was provided at Paddington, allowing Heathrow Express passengers to check in and drop off their luggage prior to flights, which was similar to the service currently provided on Hong Kong&#x27;s Airport Express. Checked baggage was transported to the airport by using the luggage space in the westbound first carriage. This service was withdrawn due to low usage and high cost of operation.

In the late 1990s, BAA proposed an extension of the line to St Pancras, proposing use of the Dudding Hill line to access the Midland Main Line to access St Pancras. Railtrack proposed a stopping service from Heathrow to St Pancras, by using London Underground tracks. This was part of Railtrack&#x27;s bid to win the public-private partnership (PPP) contract to upgrade and maintain the sub-surface lines of the Underground. Neither proposal took place, following Railtrack&#x27;s financial issues in the early 2000s.

In March 2008, the service was extended to the Heathrow Terminal 5 station with the opening of the new Terminal 5. In 2010, a dedicated shuttle between Heathrow Central and Terminal 4 was introduced, timed to connect with the main Heathrow Express service to/from Terminal 5 to improve connections between the terminals.

During 2009, flight information display screens were introduced at London Paddington. In 2017, Heathrow Express announced that over 100 million passengers had used the service since opening in 1998.

In March 2018, the Department for Transport and Heathrow Airport Holdings announced that the contract allowing Heathrow Express to operate had been extended to 2028. During August 2018, Great Western Railway (GWR) took over the operation of Heathrow Express as part of a new management contract. Heathrow Airport continues to be responsible for commercial aspects of the service, including marketing, ticket pricing and revenue management, while GWR are now responsible for operations. In December 2020, new trains were introduced, replacing the trains used since the service began in 1998.

=== Heathrow Connect to Elizabeth line ===
In June 2005, Heathrow Express began jointly providing a new Heathrow Connect service, which saw a new twice-hourly stopping service on the same route between Paddington and Heathrow using EMUs from the Siemens Desiro family. Heathrow Airport Holdings had provided the on-board staff through Heathrow Express as part of the contract. This continued until May 2018, when Heathrow Connect was absorbed into TfL Rail ahead of the new Crossrail project. In May 2022, TfL Rail services were rebranded as the Elizabeth line, with through trains running through central London from November 2022. Heathrow Express services will continue to terminate at London Paddington.

==Service==
Trains depart Paddington every 15minutes from 05:10 (06:10 on Sunday) until 23:25, and there is a similar quarter-hourly service in the return direction. At Paddington they use dedicated platforms 6 and 7, although on occasions other platforms are used. There are two stops at Heathrow: Heathrow Terminals 2 &amp; 3 (journey time from Paddington 15minutes) and Heathrow Terminal 5 (journey time 21minutes), platforms 3 and 4. Passengers travelling between terminals can do so for free, with passengers for Heathrow Terminal 4 having to change to an Elizabeth line train at Heathrow Terminals 2 &amp; 3 station.

=== On board ===
Trains offer a choice of two classes of travel: express class which corresponds to standard class, and &quot;business first&quot; class which corresponds to first class. Both classes are fully accessible, with large luggage storage spaces and complimentary Wi-Fi. First class offers wider seats and a table at every seat, as well as &#x27;Fast Track&#x27; security at the airport terminals.

Children under 16 travel free of charge with a fare-paying adult; unaccompanied children may travel free of charge in express class only with proof of a same-day flight to or from Heathrow.

==Route==
The service runs along Network Rail&#x27;s Great Western Main Line from Paddington to Airport Junction. The line from Airport Junction to the airport terminals is owned by Heathrow Airport Holdings but maintained by Network Rail. The line is electrified at overhead and uses Automatic Train Protection (ATP) and European Train Control System (ETCS). The controlling signal centre for the entire route is the Thames Valley Signalling Centre (TVSC) in Didcot.

On 29 December 2020, the first of twelve Class 387 units from the Bombardier Electrostar family began service with Heathrow Express, having replaced the Class 332 fleet. The units transferred from Great Western Railway who are also responsible for their maintenance and operation within Heathrow Express. The units underwent modifications prior to their introduction on Heathrow Express which included the fitting of USB power sockets, extra luggage space, work tables, on-board Wi-Fi and HD TVs. A new Business First cabin was also included in a 2+1 configuration with reclining seats.

===Past fleet===
The initial BAA/BR joint venture initially proposed use of Networker trains, similar to those purchased elsewhere by Network SouthEast in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Instead, 14 Class 332 trainsets were ordered from Siemens Transportation Systems in July 1994. These were built by CAF with traction equipment supplied by Siemens, and first entered service in 1998. Additional carriages were ordered in 1998 to extend the trains firstly to four carriages, then in 2001 to extend 5 of the trains to five carriages in length.
Until May 2018, Heathrow Express leased a singular Class 360 unit which operated the shuttle service between Heathrow Central and Heathrow Terminal 4. Following the withdrawal of the Class 360 unit, all Heathrow Express services were operated by Class 332 units. In 2019, it was announced that all the Class 332 units would be replaced by a fleet of twelve Class 387 units from Great Western Railway with GWR also managing their introduction and arrival. The first Class 332 unit was withdrawn and scrapped in November 2020 and by 28 December 2020, all of the units were withdrawn.

<text>The Vatican Museums (; ) are the public museums of the Vatican City. They display works from the immense collection amassed by the Catholic Church and the papacy throughout the centuries, including several of the most well-known Roman sculptures and most important masterpieces of Renaissance art in the world. The museums contain roughly 70,000 works, of which 20,000 are on display, and currently employs 640 people who work in 40 different administrative, scholarly, and restoration departments.

Pope Julius II founded the museums in the early 16th century. The Sistine Chapel, with its ceiling and altar wall decorated by Michelangelo, and the Stanze di Raffaello (decorated by Raphael) are on the visitor route through the Vatican Museums, considered among the most canonical and distinctive works of Western and European art.

In 2023, the Vatican Museums were visited by 6.8 million people. They ranked second in the list of most-visited art museums in the world after the Louvre, and third on the list of most-visited museums.

There are 24 galleries, or rooms, in total, with the Sistine Chapel, notably, being the last room visited within the Museum.

==History==
The Vatican Museums trace their origin to a single marble sculpture, purchased in the 16th century: &quot;Laocoön and His Sons&quot; was discovered on 14 January 1506, in a vineyard near the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. Pope Julius II sent Giuliano da Sangallo and Michelangelo, who were working at the Vatican, to examine the discovery. On their recommendation, the Pope immediately purchased the sculpture from the vineyard owner. The Pope put the sculpture, which represents the Trojan priest Laocoön and his two sons, Antiphantes and Thymbraeus being attacked by giant serpents, on public display at the Vatican exactly one month after its discovery.

Benedict XIV founded the &quot;Museum Christianum&quot;, and some of the Vatican collections formed the Lateran Museum, which Pius IX founded by decree in 1854.

The museums celebrated their 500th anniversary in October 2006 by permanently opening the excavations of a Vatican Hill necropolis to the public.

On 1 January 2017, Barbara Jatta became the Director of the Vatican Museums, replacing Antonio Paolucci who had been director since 2007.

==Pinacoteca Vaticana==
The art gallery was housed in the Borgia Apartment until Pius XI ordered construction of a dedicated building. The new building, designed by Luca Beltrami, was inaugurated on 27 October 1932. The museum&#x27;s paintings include:

* Giotto: &quot;Stefaneschi Triptych&quot;
* Olivuccio di Ciccarello: &quot;Opere di Misericordia&quot;
* Filippo Lippi: &quot;Marsuppini Coronation&quot;
* Giovanni Bellini: &quot;Pietà&quot;
* Melozzo da Forlì: &quot;Sixtus IV Appointing Platina as Prefect of the Vatican Library&quot;
* Pietro Perugino: &quot;Decemviri Altarpiece&quot; and &quot;San Francesco al Prato Resurrection&quot;
*Leonardo da Vinci: &quot;Saint Jerome in the Wilderness&quot;
* Raphael: &quot;Madonna of Foligno&quot;, &quot;Oddi Altarpiece&quot; and &quot;Transfiguration&quot;
* Titian: &quot;Frari Madonna&quot;
* Antonio da Correggio: &quot;Christ in Glory&quot;
* Paolo Veronese: &quot;The Vision of Saint Helena&quot;
* Caravaggio: &quot;The Entombment of Christ&quot;
* Domenichino, &quot;The Last Communion of Saint Jerome&quot;
* Nicolas Poussin, &quot;The Martyrdom of Saint Erasmus&quot;
* Jan Matejko: &quot;Sobieski at Vienna&quot;

==Collection of Modern Religious Art==
The Collection of Modern Religious Art was added in 1973 and houses paintings and sculptures from such artists as Carlo Carrà, Giorgio de Chirico, Vincent van Gogh, Paul Gauguin, Marc Chagall, Paul Klee, Salvador Dalí, and Pablo Picasso.

==Sculpture museums==
The group of museums includes several sculpture museums surrounding the Cortile del Belvedere. These are the Museo Gregoriano Profano, with classical sculpture, and others as below:

===Museo Pio-Clementino===


The museum takes its name from two popes: Clement XIV, who established the museum, and Pius VI, who brought it to completion. Clement XIV came up with the idea of creating a new museum in Innocent VIII&#x27;s Belvedere Palace and started the refurbishment work.

Clement XIV founded the Museo Pio-Clementino in 1771; it originally contained artworks of antiquity and the Renaissance. The museum and collection were enlarged by Clement&#x27;s successor Pius VI. Today, the museum houses works of Greek and Roman sculpture. Some notable galleries are as follows:
* Octagonal Court (aka &quot;Belvedere Courtyard&quot; and &quot;Cortile delle Statue&quot;): this was where some of the first ancient classical statues in the papal collections were first displayed. Some of the most famous pieces, the Apollo of the Belvedere and Laocoön and His Sons have been here since the early 1500s.
* Sala Rotonda: shaped like a miniature Pantheon, the room has ancient mosaics on the floors, and ancient statues lining the perimeter, including a gilded bronze statue of Hercules and the Braschi Antinous.
* Greek Cross Gallery (&quot;Sala a Croce Greca&quot;): with the porphyry sarcophagi of Constance and Saint Helena, daughter and mother of Constantine the Great.
* Gallery of the Statues (&quot;Galleria delle Statue&quot;): as its name implies, holds various important statues, including &quot;Sleeping Ariadne&quot; and the bust of &quot;Menander&quot;. It also contains the &quot;Barberini Candelabra&quot;.
* Gallery of the Busts (&quot;Galleria dei Busti&quot;) Many ancient busts are displayed.
* Cabinet of the Masks (&quot;Gabinetto delle Maschere&quot;). The name comes from the mosaic on the floor of the gallery, found in Villa Adriana, which shows ancient theater masks. Statues are displayed along the walls, including the &quot;Three Graces&quot;.
* Sala delle Muse: houses the statue group of Apollo and the nine muses, uncovered in a Roman villa near Tivoli in 1774, as well as statues by important ancient Greek or Roman sculptors. The centerpiece is the Belvedere Torso, revered by Michelangelo and other Renaissance men.
* Sala degli Animali: so named because of the many ancient statues of animals.

===Museo Chiaramonti===
This museum was founded in the early 19th century by Pius VII, whose surname before his election as Pope was Chiaramonti. The museum consists of a large arched gallery in which are exhibited several statues, sarcophagi and friezes. The New Wing, or Braccio Nuovo, built by Raffaele Stern, houses statues including the Augustus of Prima Porta, the &quot;Doryphoros&quot;, and &quot;The River Nile&quot;. It is in the Neoclassical style and has a wide arched roof with skylights. The Galleria Lapidaria forms part of the Museo Chiaramonti, and contains over 3,000 stone tablets and inscriptions. It is accessible only with special permission, usually for the purpose of academic study.

===Museo Gregoriano Etrusco===
Founded by Gregory XVI in 1837, this museum has nine galleries and houses Etruscan pieces, coming from archaeological excavations in the territory of the Papal State as well as other works already held in the Vatican. The collection include vases, sarcophagus, bronzes, terracotta, ceramics as well as works from the Falcioni and Guglielmi Collections.

===Museo Gregoriano Egiziano===
This museum houses a large collection of artifacts from Ancient Egypt and also many Egyptian works of Roman production in nine rooms. The Carlo Grassi Collection of bronzes is part of the collection. Such material includes papyruses, sarcophagi, mummies, sculptures and reproductions of the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;.

==Vatican Historical Museum==
The Vatican Historical Museum () was founded in 1973 at the behest of Paul VI, and was initially hosted in environments under the Square Garden. In 1987, it moved to the main floor of the Lateran Palace, where it opened in March 1991.

==Highlights==

* The red marble papal throne, formerly in the Basilica of Saint John Lateran.
* Roman sculpture, tombstones, and inscriptions, including the Early Christian Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus and Dogmatic sarcophagus, and the epitaph of Lucius Cornelius Scipio Barbatus.
* The Raphael Rooms with many works by Raphael and his workshop, including the masterpiece &quot;The School of Athens&quot; (1509–1511).
* The Niccoline Chapel.
* The Sistine Chapel, including the Sistine Chapel ceiling (gallery).
* The Gallery of Maps: topographical maps of the whole of Italy, painted on the walls by friar Ignazio Danti of Perugia, commissioned by Gregory XIII (1572–1585). It remains the world&#x27;s largest pictorial geographical study.
* The frescoes and other works in the Borgia Apartment built for the Borgia pope Alexander VI.
* The Bramante Staircase is a double spiral staircase designed by Giuseppe Momo in 1932. The staircase has two parts, a double helix, and is of shallow incline, being a stepped ramp rather than a true staircase. It encircles the outer wall of a stairwell about wide and with a clear space at the centre. The balustrade around the ramp is of ornately worked metal.

==Incidents==
On 18 August 2022, two members of the climate activist group Ultima Generazione glued themselves to the marble base of the Laocoon statue and unfurled a banner calling for an end to fossil fuels while a third member filmed them. Conservationists said that the act resulted in permanent damage to the sculpture, with restoration works costing 3,148 euros. A Vatican court subsequently sentenced the three to a nine-month suspended prison sentence and fines of up to 28,000 euros ($30,000).

On 5 October 2022, an American tourist was arrested after hurling a Roman bust at the Chiaramonti Museum and damaging another bust. &quot;Il Messaggero&quot; reported that the man damaged the artefacts in anger after he was informed that he could not have an audience with Pope Francis as part of his vacation wish. The museum&#x27;s press director Matteo Alessandrini said one bust lost part of a nose and an ear, while the other was knocked off its pedestal. Conservation and repair works on the sculptures were estimated to cost 15,000 euros ($14,800 US) and took about 300 hours to be completed.

<text>The Tenor horn (British English; Alto horn in American English, Althorn in Germany; occasionally referred to as E horn) is a brass instrument in the saxhorn family and is usually pitched in E. It has a bore that is mostly conical, like the flugelhorn and euphonium, and normally uses a deep, cornet-like mouthpiece.

It is most commonly used in British brass bands, and Mexican banda music whereas the French horn tends to take the corresponding parts in concert bands and orchestras. However, the tenor horn has occasionally been used as an alternative to the French horn in concert bands.

==Description==
The tenor horn is a valved brass instrument (in E) which has a predominantly conical bore like that of the euphonium and flugelhorn. It uses a deep funnel- or cup-shaped mouthpiece. The tenor horn&#x27;s conical bore and deep mouthpiece produce a mellow, rounded tone that is often used as a middle voice, supporting the melodies of the trumpets, cornets, or flugelhorns, and fills the gap above the lower tenor and bass instruments (the trombone, baritone horn, euphonium, and tuba). Its valves are typically, though not exclusively, piston valves.

The tenor horn has been made and is made in various shapes: the most common in the United States and the UK, and in most other parts of the world, is a sort of mini-tuba shape, with the bell pointing upward, which may help the voice blend before reaching the audience. In contrast, the solo horn (found mainly in Europe) looks like (and indeed effectively &quot;is&quot;) an enlarged flugelhorn, with the bell pointing forward, projecting more toward the audience. Another older and lesser-known variant has the bell facing backward (for military marching bands that preceded the soldiers, thus helping them hear better and keep better time in marching). Still another variant has a detachable bell, easily rotated to point in the direction of the player&#x27;s choice.

The standard bell-up horn comes in two basic shapes - one with the beginning of the bell looping over the top of the valves and the other looping below the valves.

These types are the most frequently encountered in the United States and UK. Only the standard upright instrument is seen in UK brass bands.
Within the British brass band, the tenor horn section usually plays part of the alto and tenor lines in the middle of the band, with the Solo Horn player having occasional solo passages. Historically, the tenor horn has gained little recognition as a solo instrument in its own right, but in recent years this has been gradually changing. The instrument&#x27;s timbre, with a relatively soft attack and mellow sound, aids it in its ability to blend into the overall band sound, along with the other members of the saxhorn family. Modern tenor horn manufacturers aim to create instruments with improved power and projection, whilst preserving their characteristic mellow tone. Among these, models made by Besson, Yamaha, and Geneva have been particularly successful.

==Range==
The nominal range of the tenor horn (expressed in concert pitch) is from the A an octave and a minor third below middle C to the E an octave and a minor third above middle C (A2 to E5 in scientific pitch notation). Experienced players can reach at least a major third higher than this. Additionally, as the tenor horn is a whole-bore brass instrument, most players can play some pedal tones, the fundamentals (first partials) of (at least) the shorter tubing lengths.

===Notation===
Tenor horn parts are written in the treble clef. The tenor horn is an E transposing instrument written a major sixth above concert pitch: the tenor horn notation for middle C represents the E below middle C in concert pitch (E3 in scientific pitch notation).

==History==
The instrument known today as the tenor/alto horn was developed in the 1840s by the Belgian instrument maker Adolphe Sax who, among other instrument design activities, designed two similar families of valved brass instruments, the saxhorn and the saxotromba. The surviving E alto instruments by Sax all have inner diameters described in the saxotromba patent. In this patent the soprano voice (descant) is tuned in E and thence descending through B (contralto) to E (alto). The next family member below the alto saxotromba was described as a baritone in B. Ascending from baritone, logically the next E family member above it is a tenor. The inconsistency spread across multiple descriptions and patents over decades apparently is the source of confusion as regards the names &quot;tenor&quot; vs. &quot;alto&quot; horn.

The modern instrument has a larger diameter and now resembles Sax&#x27;s specification of the saxhorn more than it does that of the saxotromba.

A great deal of interesting historical technical information on the saxhorn is found in the &quot;Saxhorn&quot; entry of Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Vol. 4 (1909).

In the 1970s, King Musical Instruments produced a variation on the tenor/alto horn, called the &quot;altonium&quot;. This instrument was keyed in F, and it utilized the same mouthpiece as the French horn. From their 1971 catalog, King Instruments produced two models of the altonium: numbers 1147 and 1148. The 1147 was a straight model, and the 1148 was a bell forward model.

In the US, the alto horn is colloquially known as the &quot;peck horn&quot;, supposedly because these instruments were employed in band music to &quot;peck away at&quot; the off-beats. This name is mentioned in &quot;The Music Man&quot;, and a French horn-patterned peck horn can be seen in the scene where Professor Hill is explaining the Think System as applied to Beethoven&#x27;s Minuet in G and a small boy asks him how to play it.

==Repertoire==
The tenor horn is very rarely included in the symphony orchestra, where its place is taken by the French horn. Instead, it is a fixture of British brass bands, where it often plays a role similar to that of the orchestral horn in the symphony orchestra. The tenor horn has also been used in concert bands as a replacement for the French horn. In the past, many publishers included parts in both Eb (for the tenor horn) and F (for the French horn). These parts were the same, just transposed into the pitch of the given instrument. Some publishers still follow this practice.

Although Gustav Mahler orchestrated his Seventh Symphony to include one &quot;tenorhorn in B&quot;, that instrument is more akin to the baritone horn, which is a fourth lower.

<text>The forint (, sign Ft; code HUF) is the currency of Hungary. It was formerly divided into 100 fillér, but fillér coins are no longer in circulation. The introduction of the forint on 1 August 1946 was a crucial step in the post-World War II stabilisation of the Hungarian economy, and the currency remained relatively stable until the 1980s. Transition to a market economy in the early 1990s adversely affected the value of the forint; inflation peaked at 35% in 1991. Between 2001 and 2022, inflation was in single digits, and the forint has been declared fully convertible. In May 2022, inflation reached 10.7% amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine and economic uncertainty. As a member of the European Union, the long-term aim of the Hungarian government may be to replace the forint with the euro, although under the current government there is no target date for adopting the euro.

==History==

The forint&#x27;s name comes from the city of Florence, where gold coins called &quot;fiorino d&#x27;oro&quot; were minted from 1252. In Hungary, the &quot;florentinus&quot; (later &quot;forint&quot;), also a gold-based currency, was used from 1325 under Charles Robert, with several other countries following Hungary&#x27;s example.

Between 1868 and 1892, the forint was the name used in Hungarian for the currency of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, known in German as the &quot;Gulden&quot;. It was subdivided into 100 krajczár (&quot;krajcár&quot; in modern Hungarian orthography; cf German &quot;Kreuzer&quot;).

The forint was reintroduced on 1 August 1946, after the pengő was rendered worthless by massive hyperinflation in 1945–46, the highest ever recorded. This was brought about by a mixture of the high demand for reparations from the USSR, Soviet plundering of Hungarian industries, and the holding of Hungary&#x27;s gold reserves in the United States. The different parties in the government had different plans to solve this problem. To the Independent Smallholders&#x27; Party–which had won a large majority in the 1945 Hungarian parliamentary election–as well as the Social Democrats, outside support was essential. However, the Soviet Union and its local supporters in the Hungarian Communist Party were opposed to raising loans in the West, and thus the Communist Party masterminded the procedure using exclusively domestic resources. The Communist plan called for tight limits on personal spending, as well as the concentration of existing stocks in state hands.

When the forint was introduced, its value was defined on the basis of 1 kilogram of fine gold being 13,210 Ft (or 1 Ft = 75.7 mg fine gold). Therefore, given that gold was fixed at £8 8s (£8.40 in modern decimal notation) sterling per troy ounce, one pound sterling was at that time worth about 49 forint.

==Coins==
In 1946, coins were introduced in denominations of 2, 10, 20 fillérs and 1, 2, 5 forints. The silver 5 forint coin was reissued only in the next year; later it was withdrawn from circulation. Five and 50 fillérs coins were issued in 1948. In 1967, a 5 forint coin was reintroduced, followed by a 10 forint in 1971 and 20 forint in 1982.

In 1992, a new series of coins was introduced in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and (a somewhat different, 500‰ silver) 200 forint. Production of the 2 and 5 fillér coins ceased in 1992, with all fillér coins withdrawn from circulation by 1999. From 1996, a bicolor 100 forint coin was minted to replace the 1992 version, since the latter was considered too big and ugly, and could easily be mistaken for the 20 forint coin.

Silver 200 forint coins were withdrawn in 1998 (as their nominal value was too low compared to their precious metal content); the 1 and 2 forint coins remained legal tender until 29 February 2008. For cash purchases, the total price is now rounded to the nearest multiple of 5 forint (to 0 or to 5). A new 200 forint coin made of base metal alloy was introduced in place of the 200 forint banknote on 15 June 2009.

==Banknotes==
In 1946, 10 and 100 forint notes were introduced by the Hungarian National Bank. A new series of higher quality banknotes (in denominations of 10, 20 and 100 forints) were introduced in 1947 and 1948. 50 forint notes were added in 1953, 500 forint notes were introduced in 1970, followed by 1,000 forints in 1983, and 5,000 forints in 1991.

A completely redesigned new series of banknotes in denominations of 200, 500, 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, 10,000 and 20,000 forints was introduced gradually between 1997 and 2001. Each banknote depicts a famous Hungarian leader or politician on the obverse and a place or event related to him on the reverse. All of the banknotes are watermarked, contain an embedded vertical security strip, an invisible ink design and are suitable for visually impaired people. The 1,000 forints and higher denominations are protected by an interwoven holographic security strip. The notes share the common size of . The banknotes are printed by the Hungarian Banknote Printing Corp. in Budapest on paper manufactured by the Diósgyőr Papermill in Miskolc.

Commemorative banknotes have also been issued: 1,000 and 2,000 forint notes to commemorate the millennium (in 2000) and a 500-forint note to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 1956 revolution (in 2006).

The 200-forint banknote was withdrawn from circulation in 2009, as its value inflated over time. Also due to the embarrassment caused by the fact that the model of the portrait on the banknote, purported to be of King Charles Robert (of whom no authentic contemporary depictions survived), turned out to be of an acquaintance of the designer, the managing director of the security company that supplied the banknote printing company. The banknote was replaced by a bimetallic 200-forint coin featuring the iconic Széchenyi Chain Bridge.

Forgery of forint banknotes is not significant. However, forged 20,000 forint notes printed on the paper of 2,000 forint notes after dissolving the original ink might come up and are not easy to recognize. Another denomination preferred by counterfeiters was the 1,000 forint note until improved security features were added in 2006.

Worn banknotes no longer fit for circulation are withdrawn, destroyed and turned into briquettes which are donated to public benefit (charitable) organizations to be used as heating fuel.

In 2014, a new revised version of the 1997 banknote series was gradually put into circulation beginning with the 10,000 Ft banknote in 2014 and completed with the 500 Ft banknote in 2019.

In 2022 after Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, the EUR-HUF exchange rate breached the 400 forints per 1 euro line for the first time, but rates at that level or higher lasted until the end of 2022. Some time later, the forint also depreciated against the US dollar, breaching the same line. The forint is still more than 400 forints per 1 euro in November 2024. Against the US dollar the forint strengthened more markedly, returning to levels below 400 in November 2022 and below 350 in April 2023.

<text>William Hepworth Thompson (27 March 18101 October 1886) was an English classical scholar and Master of Trinity College, Cambridge.

==Early life==
Thompson was born at York and was privately educated in Buckinghamshire before entering Trinity College, Cambridge in 1828.

==Career==
Graduating BA as 4th classic in 1832, he became a Fellow of Trinity in 1834. In 1853 he was appointed Professor of Greek (to which a canonry in Ely Cathedral was then for the first time attached), and in 1866 Master of Trinity College. Also in 1866, he married Frances Elizabeth, daughter of William Selwyn, widow of George Peacock. With the exception of the year 1836, when he acted as headmaster of a newly established school in Leicester, his life was divided between Cambridge and Ely. Thompson died in Cambridge, at the Master&#x27;s Lodge, twenty years after being appointed Master.

Thompson had succeeded William Whewell as Master and proved a worthy successor; the twenty years of his mastership were years of progress, and he himself took an active part in the abolition of tests (in particular the compulsory religious tests) and the reform of university studies and of the college statutes. In &quot;Trinity College An Historical Sketch&quot;, G. M. Trevelyan notes:

But Thompson and the society over which he presided (1866–1886) were more ready than their predecessors to accept and even to promote changes long overdue. Trinity men were now in the forefront of the reform movement in Cambridge, no longer deprecating but welcoming the help of Parliament to remove from the living academic body the shackles of an age out-worn.

The efforts Thompson and others played an important role in transforming Trinity College and Cambridge University into more meritocratic institutions.

As a scholar Thompson devoted his attention almost entirely to Plato; and his &quot;Phaedrus&quot; (1868) and &quot;Gorgias&quot; (1871), with especially valuable introductions, remained as the standard English editions of these two dialogues for over forty years.

The quote &quot;We are none of us infallible, not even the youngest of us&quot; is attributed to Thompson and is recorded in &quot;Collections and Recollections&quot; by George W. E. Russell (1898) and also in &quot;Trinity College An Historical Sketch&quot; by G.M. Trevelyan (1943). Thompson uttered these words while Master of Trinity at a College Meeting of the Fellowship on 30 March 1878. As noted above, this was a time of great reformation within the College, willingly supported by Thompson. Gerald Balfour, then a junior Fellow of the College, later politician and Chief Secretary for Ireland, proposed a revision of the College Statutes. The quote was, as Trevelyan puts it, &quot;directed in a kindly spirit at the reforming zeal of a group of junior Fellows&quot;. Incidentally, the motion was seconded by Coutts Trotter, one of the most senior Fellows.

:I understand equations, both the simple and quadratical,
:About binomial theorem I&#x27;m teeming with a lot o&#x27; news,
:With many cheerful facts about the square of the hypotenuse.
:(W.S. Gilbert, &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;)

&quot;Anapestic (acephalous)&quot;

:Ere frost-flower and snow-blossom faded and fell, and the splendour of winter had passed out of sight,
:The ways of the woodlands were fairer and stranger than dreams that fulfil us in sleep with delight;
:The breath of the mouths of the winds had hardened on tree-tops and branches that glittered and swayed
:Such wonders and glories of blossomlike snow or of frost that outlightens all flowers till it fade
:(A. C. Swinburne, &quot;March: An Ode&quot;)

&quot;Dactyllic&quot;

There is, however, the occasional song, among them Marty Robbins&#x27;s Grammy-winning (1961) &quot;El Paso.&quot;

:Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
:I fell in love with a Mexican girl
:Nighttime would find me in Rosa&#x27;s Cantina
:Music would play and Feleena would whirl
:Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
:Off to my left ride a dozen or more
:Shouting and shooting; I can&#x27;t let them catch me
:I have to make it to Rosa&#x27;s back door ...

<text>Roy Hudd (16 May 1936 – 15 March 2020) was an English comedian, actor, presenter, radio host, author and authority on the history of music hall entertainment.

== Early life ==
Hudd was born in Croydon on 16 May 1936 to Evalina &quot;Evie&quot; (née Barham) and Harry Hudd. His father was a carpenter who left the family shortly after the Second World War, and his mother, who had a history of mental health problems, committed suicide by gas when Hudd was nine years old. Hudd was primarily brought up by his grandmother, and attended Tavistock Secondary Modern School in Croydon and Croydon Secondary Technical School. After completing his national service in the Royal Air Force, he studied commercial art at the Regent Street Polytechnic. He then worked as a messenger for an advertising agency, as a window dresser, and as a commercial artist, working under Harry Beck.

He made his professional debut as a comedian at the Streatham Hill Theatre on 27 October 1957, in a show in aid of the Sir Philip Game Boys&#x27; Club, of which he had been a member. Initially he worked with Eddie Kay, a friend from Croydon who had also been a member of the boys&#x27; club, the two billing themselves as &quot;the peculiar pair&quot;. In 1958, they joined Butlin&#x27;s Clacton as Redcoats, working alongside Cliff Richard and Dave Allen.

== Radio ==
Although Hudd and Kay had made a brief appearance as &quot;discoveries&quot; on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;In Town Tonight&quot; in 1958, Hudd made his solo debut on radio in 1959 on &quot;Workers&#x27; Playtime&quot;. His BBC Radio 2 satirical series &quot;The News Huddlines&quot; ran from 1975 to 2001. His other radio credits include playing Max Quordlepleen, the host at The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, in the original radio series of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; (1978), &quot;Crowned Hudds&quot; (1994–95), &quot;The Newly Discovered Casebook of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1999–2000) and &quot;Like They&#x27;ve Never Been Gone&quot; (1999–2002).

== Television ==
Hudd broke into television in the mid-1960s in sketch series such as &quot;The Illustrated Weekly Hudd&quot; and &quot;The Roy Hudd Show&quot;. His acting roles included the Dennis Potter series &quot;Lipstick on Your Collar&quot;, for which he received critical praise, and &quot;Karaoke&quot;. In the mid 1990s, he appeared in two series of &quot;Common As Muck&quot;, a drama about a group of refuse collectors, alongside Edward Woodward. In 2000, Hudd appeared as neighbour Mr. Smedley in one episode of &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot;. From 2002 to 2003, he appeared as the undertaker Archie Shuttleworth in the ITV soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and subsequently returned for guest appearances in 2006 and 2010; the character died offscreen in December 2018. He also starred in the ITV drama &quot;The Quest&quot;, alongside Sir David Jason and Hywel Bennett, from 2002 to 2004. In 2007, he appeared in episodes of &quot;New Tricks&quot;, &quot;Casualty&quot; (and again in July 2019) and &quot;The Last Detective&quot;. In 2010, he appeared in BBC dramas &quot;Missing&quot; and &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;, as well as two episodes of &quot;Just William&quot;.

In 2012, he appeared in an episode of the BBC drama &quot;Call the Midwife&quot;. In 2014, he appeared in episodes of &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order: UK&quot; and &quot;Holby City&quot;. In December 2015, Hudd played Bud Flanagan in the BBC drama &quot;We&#x27;re Doomed! The Dad&#x27;s Army Story&quot;, about the creation of the titular long-running sitcom. In 2016 he appeared in an episode of &quot;Benidorm&quot;. In 2017, he appeared in the ITV series &quot;Broadchurch&quot;.

== Stage appearances ==
Hudd appeared in many pantomime and variety performances. In 1977 he starred as Fagin in the West End revival of Lionel Bart&#x27;s musical &quot;Oliver!&quot; at the Albery Theatre and, in 1982, he played Bud Flanagan in &quot;Underneath the Arches&quot; at the Prince of Wales Theatre, for which he won a Society of West End Theatre Award. In 2000, he starred in a musical version of &quot;Hard Times&quot; at the Theatre Royal Haymarket. In May 2008 Hudd appeared as Njegus in the English National Opera production of &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; at the London Coliseum. and the same year he played the part of the Wizard in a production of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; at London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall. Hudd played Tom Oakley in &quot;Goodnight Mister Tom&quot; at the Theatre Royal Bury St Edmunds in 2018. This was Hudd&#x27;s local theatre and was described as &quot;a theatre he absolutely loved.&quot; by his wife Debbie. In 2019, he toured the UK in a production of Oscar Wilde&#x27;s play &quot;A Woman of No Importance&quot; alongside Liza Goddard and Isla Blair.

== Music hall ==
Hudd wrote several books on music hall, re-recorded music hall records, and appeared in the music hall revival show &quot;The Good Old Days.&quot; He was seen by broadcasters as an authority on the subject and was the longstanding President of the British Music Hall Society. His CD, &quot;Mirth, Magic and Melodrama&quot; consists of a collection of classic monologues from the music hall days, including &quot;The Pig&quot; and &quot;The Lion and Albert&quot;, first recorded by Stanley Holloway. For &quot;Celebrity Mastermind&quot;, broadcast in January 2014, Hudd answered questions on the specialist subject of music hall comedian Dan Leno.

He was an authority on the comedian Max Miller and was known for his impersonation of Miller. He appeared as his hero in the Big Finish Productions &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio play &quot;Pier Pressure&quot; in 2006. He was President of the Max Miller Appreciation Society.

== Charity work ==
Hudd had a long association with the Bristol Hospital Broadcasting Service, where he was considered an honorary member. In 1994, he officially opened their current studios in the Bristol Royal Infirmary. He was also a past King Rat of the show business charity the Grand Order of Water Rats in 1989 and 2000.

In addition to this, he was the first Honorary President of Sandwell Hospital Radio in West Bromwich for a period of ten years, visiting the studios, members and patients whenever he was appearing in the West Midlands.

==Personal life and death==
Hudd was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2004 New Year Honours List for services to entertainment. In 1983 (1982 season), he was awarded the Society of West End Theatre Award as Best Actor in a Musical for his role in &quot;Underneath the Arches&quot;, as Bud Flanagan.

On 29 November 2010, Hudd was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Letters by the University of Westminster; he studied commercial art there when it was the Regent Street Polytechnic.

<text>Tallulah Brockman Bankhead (January 31, 1902 – December 12, 1968) was an American actress. Primarily an actress of the stage, Bankhead also appeared in several films including an award-winning performance in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Lifeboat&quot; (1944). She also had a brief but successful career on radio and made appearances on television. In all, Bankhead amassed nearly 300 film, stage, television and radio roles during her career. She was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1972 and the Alabama Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1981.

Bankhead was a member of the Bankhead and Brockman family, a prominent Alabama political family. Her grandfather and her uncle were U.S. senators, and her father was Speaker of the House of Representatives. Bankhead supported liberal causes, including the budding civil rights movement. She also supported foster children and helped families escape the Spanish Civil War and World War II. Bankhead was an alcohol and drug user; she reportedly smoked 120 cigarettes a day and talked candidly about her vices. She also had a series of sexual relationships with both men and women.

==Early life==


Tallulah Brockman Bankhead was born on January 31, 1902, in Huntsville, Alabama, to William Brockman Bankhead and Adelaide Eugenia &quot;Ada&quot; Bankhead (née Sledge); her great-great-grandfather, James Bankhead (1738–1799) was born in Ulster, Ireland, and settled in South Carolina. Bankhead was named after her paternal grandmother, who in turn was named after Tallulah Falls, Georgia. Her father hailed from the Bankhead and Brockman political families, active in the Democratic Party of the South in general and of Alabama in particular. Her father was the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1936 to his death in 1940. She was the niece of Senator John H. Bankhead II and granddaughter of Senator John H. Bankhead. Her mother, Adelaide &quot;Ada&quot; Eugenia Sledge, was a native of Como, Mississippi, and was engaged to another man when she met William Bankhead on a trip to Huntsville to buy her wedding dress. The two fell in love at first sight and were married on January 31, 1900, in Memphis, Tennessee. Their first child, Evelyn Eugenia (January 24, 1901 – May 11, 1979), was born two months prematurely and had some vision difficulties.

The following year, Bankhead was born on her parents&#x27; second wedding anniversary, in a second floor apartment in what is now known as the Isaac Schiffman Building, where her father also had his office. A marker was erected to commemorate the site, and in 1980 the building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Three weeks after Bankhead&#x27;s birth, her mother died of blood poisoning (sepsis) on February 23, 1902. On her deathbed, Ada told her sister-in-law to &quot;take care of Eugenia, Tallulah will always be able to take care of herself&quot;. Bankhead was baptized next to her mother&#x27;s coffin.

William B. Bankhead, devastated by his wife&#x27;s death, descended into bouts of depression and alcoholism. Consequently, Tallulah and her sister Eugenia were mostly reared by their paternal grandmother, Tallulah James Brockman Bankhead, at the family estate called Sunset in Jasper, Alabama. As a child, Bankhead was described as &quot;extremely homely&quot; and overweight, while her sister was slim and prettier. As a result, she did everything in her efforts to gain attention, and constantly sought her father&#x27;s approval. After watching a performance at a circus, she taught herself how to cartwheel, and frequently cartwheeled about the house, sang, and recited literature that she had memorized. She was prone to throwing tantrums, rolling around the floor, and holding her breath until she was blue in the face. Her grandmother often threw a bucket of water on her to halt these outbursts.

Bankhead&#x27;s husky voice (which she described as &quot;mezzo-basso&quot;) was the result of chronic bronchitis due to childhood illness. She was described as a performer and an exhibitionist from the beginning, discovering at an early age that theatrics gained her the attention she desired. Finding she had a gift for mimicry, she entertained her classmates by imitating the schoolteachers. Bankhead said that her &quot;first performance&quot; was witnessed by the Wright brothers, Orville and Wilbur. Her Aunt Marie gave the brothers a party at her home near Montgomery, Alabama, in which the guests were asked to entertain. &quot;I won the prize for the top performance, with an imitation of my kindergarten teacher&quot;, Bankhead wrote. &quot;The judges? Orville and Wilbur Wright.&quot; Bankhead also found she had a prodigious memory for literature, memorizing poems and plays and reciting them dramatically. 
Their grandmother and aunt were beginning to find the girls difficult to handle. Their father William, who was working from their Huntsville home as a lawyer, proposed enrolling them in a convent school (although he was a Methodist and her mother an Episcopalian). In 1912, both girls were enrolled in the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Manhattanville, New York. Their father remarried in 1915; as his political career brought him to Washington, they were enrolled in a series of different schools, each a step closer to Washington. When Bankhead was 15, her aunt encouraged her to take more pride in her appearance, suggesting that she go on a diet to improve her confidence. Bankhead quickly matured into a southern belle. 

Bankhead was childhood friends with American socialite, later novelist, Zelda Sayre Fitzgerald, who married the novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald.

==Career==
===Beginnings in New York (1917–1922)===
At 15, Bankhead submitted her photo to &quot;Picture Play&quot;, which was conducting a contest and awarding a trip to New York plus a movie part to 12 winners based on their photographs. However, she forgot to send in her name or address with the picture. Bankhead learned that she was one of the winners while browsing the magazine at her local drugstore. Her photo in the magazine was captioned &quot;Who is She?&quot;, urging the mystery girl to contact the paper at once. Congressman William Bankhead sent in a letter to the magazine with her duplicate photo.

Arriving in New York, Bankhead discovered that her contest win was fleeting: she was paid $75 for three weeks&#x27; work on &quot;Who Loved Him Best&quot; and had only a minor part, but she quickly found her niche in New York City. She soon moved into the Algonquin Hotel, a hotspot for the artistic and literary elite of the era, where she quickly charmed her way into the famed Algonquin Round Table of the hotel bar. She was dubbed one of the &quot;Four Riders of the Algonquin&quot;, consisting of Bankhead, Estelle Winwood, Eva Le Gallienne, and Blyth Daly. Three of the four were non-heterosexual: Bankhead and Daly were bisexuals, and Le Gallienne was a lesbian. Bankhead&#x27;s father had warned her to avoid alcohol and men when she got to New York; Bankhead later quipped &quot;He didn&#x27;t say anything about women and cocaine.&quot; The Algonquin&#x27;s wild parties introduced Bankhead to marijuana and cocaine, of which she later remarked &quot;Cocaine isn&#x27;t habit-forming and I know because I&#x27;ve been taking it for years.&quot; Bankhead did abstain from drinking, keeping half of her promise to her father. At the Algonquin, Bankhead befriended actress Estelle Winwood. She also met Ethel Barrymore, who attempted to persuade her to change her name to Barbara. Bankhead declined, and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; later wrote &quot;she&#x27;s the only actress on both sides of the Atlantic to be recognized by her first name only.&quot;

In 1919, after roles in three other silent films, &quot;When Men Betray&quot; (1918), &quot;Thirty a Week&quot; (1918), and &quot;The Trap&quot; (1919), Bankhead made her stage debut in &quot;The Squab Farm&quot; at the Bijou Theatre in New York. She soon realized her place was on stage rather than screen, and had roles in &quot;39 East&quot; (1919), &quot;Footloose&quot; (1919), &quot;Nice People&quot; (1921), &quot;Everyday&quot; (1921), &quot;Danger&quot; (1922), &quot;Her Temporary Husband&quot; (1922), and &quot;The Exciters&quot; (1922). Though her acting was praised, the plays were commercially and critically unsuccessful. Bankhead had been in New York for five years, but had yet to score a significant hit. Restless, Bankhead moved to London.

===Fame in Great Britain (1922–1931)===
In 1923, she made her debut on the London stage at Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre. She appeared in over a dozen plays in London over the next eight years, most famously in &quot;The Dancers&quot; and at the Lyric as Jerry Lamar in Avery Hopwood&#x27;s &quot;The Gold Diggers&quot;. Her fame as an actress was ensured in 1924 when she played Amy in Sidney Howard&#x27;s &quot;They Knew What They Wanted&quot;. The show won the 1925 Pulitzer Prize.

While in London, Bankhead bought herself a Bentley, which she loved to drive. She was not very competent with directions and constantly found herself lost in the London streets. She would telephone a taxi-cab and pay the driver to drive to her destination while she followed behind in her car. During her eight years on the London stage and touring across Great Britain&#x27;s theatres, Bankhead earned a reputation for making the most out of inferior material. For example, in her autobiography, Bankhead described the opening night of a play called &quot;Conchita&quot;:

In the second act. ... I came on carrying a monkey. ... On opening night, the monkey went berserk. ... (he) snatched my black wig from my head, leaped from my arms and scampered down to the footlights. There he paused, peered out at the audience, then waved my wig over his head. ... The audience had been giggling at the absurd plot even before this simian had at me. Now it became hysterical. What did Tallulah do in this crisis? I turned a cartwheel! The audience roared. ... After the monkey business I was afraid they might boo me. Instead I received an ovation.

===Career in Hollywood (1931–1933)===

Bankhead returned to the United States in 1931, but Hollywood success eluded her in her first four films of the 1930s. She rented a home at 1712 Stanley Street in Hollywood (now 1712 North Stanley Avenue) and began hosting parties that were said to &quot;have no boundaries&quot;. Bankhead&#x27;s first film was &quot;Tarnished Lady&quot; (1931), directed by George Cukor, and the pair became fast friends. Bankhead behaved herself on the set and filming went smoothly, but she found film-making to be very boring and did not have the patience for it. After over eight years of living in Great Britain and touring on their theatrical stages, she did not like living in Hollywood; when she met producer Irving Thalberg, she asked him &quot;How do you get laid in this dreadful place?&quot; Thalberg retorted &quot;I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll have no problem. Ask anyone.&quot; Although Bankhead was not very interested in making films, the opportunity to make $50,000 per film was too good to pass up. Her 1932 movie &quot;Devil and the Deep&quot; is notable for the presence of three major co-stars, with Bankhead receiving top billing over Gary Cooper, Charles Laughton, and Cary Grant; it is the only film with Cooper and Grant in the cast, although they share no scenes together. She later said &quot;Dahling, the main reason I accepted [the part] was to fuck that divine Gary Cooper!&quot; Later in 1932, Bankhead starred opposite Robert Montgomery in &quot;Faithless&quot;.

===Return to Broadway (1933–1938)===

Returning to Broadway, Bankhead worked steadily in a series of middling plays which were, ironically, later turned into highly successful Hollywood films starring other actresses. 1933&#x27;s &quot;Forsaking All Others&quot; by Edward Barry Roberts and Frank Morgan Cavett—a romantic comedy-drama in which three friends sustain a love triangle lasting several years—was a modest success for Bankhead, running 110 performances, but the 1934 film version with Joan Crawford was one of that year&#x27;s bigger financial and critical successes. Similarly, Bankhead&#x27;s next two short-lived plays, &quot;Jezebel&quot; by Owen Davis and &quot;Dark Victory&quot; by George Brewer Jr. and Bertram Bloch, were both transformed into high-profile, prestigious film vehicles for Bette Davis.

Bankhead persevered, even through ill health. In 1933, while performing in &quot;Jezebel&quot;, Bankhead nearly died following a five-hour emergency hysterectomy due to gonorrhea, which she claimed she had contracted from either Gary Cooper or George Raft. Weighing only when she left the hospital, she vowed to continue her lifestyle, flippantly telling her doctor &quot;Don&#x27;t think this has taught me a lesson!&quot;

Bankhead continued to play in various Broadway performances over the next few years, gaining excellent notices for her portrayal of Elizabeth in a revival of Somerset Maugham&#x27;s &quot;The Circle&quot;. However, when she appeared in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; with her then-husband John Emery, the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot; critic John Mason Brown memorably carped, &quot;Tallulah Bankhead barged down the Nile last night as Cleopatra – and sank.&quot;

In a private memo written in 1936, David O. Selznick, producer of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939), called Bankhead the &quot;first choice among established stars&quot; to play Scarlett O&#x27;Hara in the upcoming film. Although her 1938 screen test for the role in black-and-white was superb, she photographed poorly in Technicolor. Selznick also reportedly believed that at age 36, she was too old to play Scarlett, who is 16 at the beginning of the film (the role eventually went to Vivien Leigh). Selznick sent Kay Brown to Bankhead to discuss the possibility of Bankhead playing brothel owner Belle Watling in the film, which she turned down.

===Critical acclaim (1939–1945)===
====Regina and Sabina====
Her brilliant portrayal of the cold and ruthless, yet fiery Regina Giddens in Lillian Hellman&#x27;s &quot;The Little Foxes&quot; (1939) won her &quot;Variety&quot; magazine&#x27;s award for Best Actress of the Year. Bankhead as Regina was lauded as &quot;one of the most electrifying performances in American theater history&quot;. During the run, she was featured on the cover of &quot;Life&quot;. Bankhead and playwright Hellman, both formidable women, feuded over the Soviet Union&#x27;s invasion of Finland. Bankhead (a strong critic of communism from the mid 1930s onwards) was said to want a portion of one performance&#x27;s proceeds to go to Finnish relief, and Hellman (a communist who had defended the Moscow Trials of 1936, and was a member of the Communist Party USA in 1938–40) objected strenuously, and the two women did not speak for the next quarter of a century, eventually reconciling in late 1963. Nevertheless, Bankhead called the character of Regina in Hellman&#x27;s play &quot;the best role I ever had in the theater&quot;.

Bankhead earned another &quot;Variety&quot; award and the New York Drama Critics&#x27; Award for Best Performance by an Actress followed her role in Thornton Wilder&#x27;s &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot;, in which Bankhead played Sabina, the housekeeper and temptress, opposite Fredric March and Florence Eldridge (husband and wife offstage). About her work in Wilder&#x27;s classic, the &quot;New York Sun&quot; wrote: &quot;Her portrayal of Sabina has comedy and passion. How she contrives both, almost at the same time, is a mystery to mere man.&quot; She also clashed with Elia Kazan on &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot; and during rehearsals of &quot;Clash by Night&quot; she called the producer, Billy Rose a &quot;loathsome bully&quot; who retorted, &quot;How could anyone bully Niagara Falls?&quot;

====&quot;Lifeboat&quot;====

In 1944, Alfred Hitchcock cast her as cynical journalist Constance Porter in her most successful film, both critically and commercially, &quot;Lifeboat&quot;. The film takes place entirely on a small boat, and was shot in a large water tank on a studio lot. During filming, the actors were sometimes battered by water-spraying machines and fans. Bankhead wrote in her memoirs that she was &quot;black and blue from the downpours and lurchings&quot;. At one point, she contracted bronchial pneumonia, halting production for a number of days. Bankhead famously did not wear underwear during production, which became apparent when she climbed up or down the ladder leading to the water tank. A widely repeated anecdote has it that Hitchcock, when pressed to do something about this, mused that he was unsure whether it was a matter for the wardrobe department, makeup, or hairdressing.

Her superbly multifaceted performance was acknowledged as her best on film and won her the New York Film Critics Circle award. A beaming Bankhead accepted her New York trophy and exclaimed: &quot;Dahlings, I was wonderful!&quot;

===Renewed success (1948–1952)===
Bankhead appeared in a revival of Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Private Lives&quot;, taking it on tour and then to Broadway for the better part of two years. The play&#x27;s run made Bankhead a fortune. From that time, Bankhead could command 10% of the gross and was billed larger than any other actor in the cast, although she usually granted equal billing to Estelle Winwood, a frequent co-star and close friend from the 1920s through Bankhead&#x27;s lifetime.

In 1950, in an effort to cut into the rating leads of &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot; and &quot;The Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy Show&quot;, which had jumped from NBC radio to CBS radio the previous season, NBC spent millions over the two seasons of &quot;The Big Show&quot; starring &quot;the glamorous, unpredictable&quot; Bankhead as its host, in which she acted not only as mistress of ceremonies, but also performed monologues (often written by Dorothy Parker) and songs. Despite Meredith Willson&#x27;s Orchestra and Chorus and top guest stars from Broadway, Hollywood, and radio, &quot;The Big Show&quot;, which earned rave reviews, failed to do more than dent Jack Benny and Edgar Bergen&#x27;s ratings. The next season, NBC installed her as one of a half-dozen rotating hosts of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The All Star Revue&quot; on Saturday nights.

Bankhead was director Irving Rapper&#x27;s first choice for the role of Amanda in the film version of Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot;. Laurette Taylor, who originated the role of Amanda, was an idol of Bankhead&#x27;s and also an alcoholic, whose brilliant performance in the original Broadway production reversed years of career decline. Rapper called Bankhead&#x27;s screen test the greatest performance he had ever seen: &quot;I thought she was going to be difficult, but she was like a child, so sweet and lovely. I was absolutely floored by her performance. It&#x27;s the greatest test I&#x27;ve ever made or seen in my life. I couldn&#x27;t believe I was seeing such reality. Bankhead was absolutely natural, so moving, so touching without even trying. The crew was stunned, too.&quot; But studio head Jack Warner rejected the idea because of his fear of Bankhead&#x27;s drinking; though she promised not to drink during shooting, he refused to give her the part. The role was given instead to Gertrude Lawrence, whose acting was panned by most critics.

===Late career (1952–1968)===
Bankhead wrote a bestselling autobiography &quot;Tallulah: My Autobiography&quot; (Harper &amp; Bros.) that was published in 1952. Though Bankhead&#x27;s career slowed in the mid-1950s, she never faded from the public eye. Her highly public and often scandalous personal life began to undermine her reputation as a terrific actress, leading to criticism she had become a caricature of herself. Although a heavy smoker, heavy drinker, and consumer of sleeping pills, Bankhead continued to perform in the 1950s and 1960s on Broadway, in radio and television, and in the occasional film, even as her body got more and more frail from the mid 1950s up until her death in 1968.

In 1953, Bankhead was enticed into appearing in a stage act at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas. She was paid a generous $20,000 per week for her appearances, reciting scenes from famous plays, reading poetry and letters that had the audience in stitches, and sang. Las Vegas critics bet her act would flop, but instead it was highly successful. She returned to the Sands for three years.

====Addiction, illness and icon status====
Around this time, Bankhead began to attract a passionate and highly loyal following of gay men, some of whom she employed as help when her lifestyle began to take a toll on her, affectionately calling them her &quot;caddies&quot;. Though she had long struggled with addiction, her condition now worsened – she began taking dangerous cocktails of drugs to fall asleep, and her maid had to tape her arms down to prevent her from consuming pills during her periods of intermittent wakefulness. In her later years, Bankhead had serious accidents and several psychotic episodes from sleep deprivation and hypnotic drug abuse. Though she always hated being alone, her struggle with loneliness began to lapse into a depression. In 1956, playing the truth game with Tennessee Williams, she confessed, &quot;I&#x27;m 54, and I wish always, always, for death. I&#x27;ve always wanted death. Nothing else do I want more.&quot;

===== &quot;The Ford Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show&quot; =====
Bankhead&#x27;s most popular and perhaps best remembered television appearance was the December 3, 1957 episode of &quot;The Ford Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show&quot;. She played herself in the classic episode, &quot;The Celebrity Next Door&quot;. The part was originally slated for Bette Davis, but Davis had to bow out after cracking a vertebra. Lucille Ball was reportedly a fan of Bankhead and did a good impression of her. By the time the episode was filmed, however, both Ball and Desi Arnaz were deeply frustrated by Bankhead&#x27;s off-camera behavior during rehearsals. It took her three hours to &quot;wake up&quot; once she arrived on the set and she often seemed drunk. She also refused to listen to the director and she did not like rehearsing. Ball and Arnaz apparently did not know about Bankhead&#x27;s antipathy to rehearsals or her ability to memorize a script quickly. After rehearsals, the filming of the episode proceeded without a hitch, and Ball congratulated Bankhead on her performance.

==== Last years on stage ====
In 1956, Bankhead appeared as Blanche DuBois (a character inspired by her) in a revival of Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; (1947). Williams (a close friend) had wanted Bankhead for the original production, but she turned it down. He called her Blanche &quot;the worst I have seen&quot;, accusing her of ruining the role to appease her fans who wanted camp. She agreed with this verdict, and made an effort to conquer the audience which her own legend had drawn about her, giving a performance two weeks later of which he remarked: &quot;I&#x27;m not ashamed to say that I shed tears almost all the way through and that when the play was finished I rushed up to her and fell to my knees at her feet. The human drama, the play of a woman&#x27;s great valor and an artist&#x27;s truth, her own, far superseded, and even eclipsed, to my eye, the performance of my own play.&quot; The director remarked that her performance exceeded those of Jessica Tandy and Vivien Leigh in the role. However, the initial reviews had decided the production&#x27;s fate, and the producer pulled the plug after 15 performances.

Bankhead received a Tony Award nomination for her performance of a bizarre 50-year-old mother in the short-lived Mary Chase play &quot;Midgie Purvis&quot; (1961). It was a physically demanding role and Bankhead insisted on doing the stunts herself, including sliding down a staircase banister. She received glowing reviews, but the play suffered from numerous rewrites and failed to last beyond a month. Her last theatrical appearance was in &quot;The Milk Train Doesn&#x27;t Stop Here Anymore&quot; (1963), a revival of another Williams play, directed by Tony Richardson. She had suffered a severe burn on her right hand from a match exploding while she lit a cigarette, and it was aggravated by the importance of jewelry props in the play. She took heavy painkillers, but these dried her mouth, and most critics thought that Bankhead&#x27;s line readings were unintelligible. As with &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, the nadir of her career, she only made five performances, and in the same unhappy theater.

====New media====
Among her last radio appearances was in an episode of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; with Roy Plomley in 1964. Bankhead, at 62 and audibly suffering from breathing difficulties from emphysema in the interview, frankly spoke of how hopeless she would be on a desert island, admitting that she &quot;couldn&#x27;t put a key in the door, dahling. I can&#x27;t do a &quot;thing&quot; for myself.&quot; In the interview, host Plomley spoke of Bankhead&#x27;s glory days as the most celebrated actress of 1920s London. Later he recalled of their interview, &quot;She was a very frail and ailing old lady, and I was shocked to see how old and ill she looked as I helped her out of a taxi. She had come from her hotel wearing a mink coat slung over a pair of lounging pyjamas, and she leaned heavily on my arm as I supported her to the lift. Her eyes were still fine, and there was still beauty in the bone structure of her face beneath the wrinkles and ravages of hard living. Her hands shook, and when she wished to go to the loo she had to ask Monica Chapman to accompany her to help her with her clothing.&quot;

Her last motion picture was a British horror film, &quot;Fanatic&quot; (1965). &quot;Fanatic&quot; was released in the U.S. as &quot;Die! Die! My Darling!&quot;, which she protested, thinking it was exploiting her famous catchphrase, but did not succeed in getting it changed. During the screening she held privately for her friends, she apologized for &quot;looking older than God&#x27;s wet nurse&quot; (in the film she wore no makeup and dyed her hair grey, and the director used very claustrophobic close-ups to accentuate her age and frailty). She called the B-movie horror flick &quot;a piece of shit&quot;, though her performance in it was praised by critics and it remains popular as a cult film and with her fans. For her role in &quot;Fanatic&quot;, she was paid $50,000. Her last appearances on television came in March 1967 as the villainous Black Widow in the &quot;Batman&quot; TV series, and in the December 17, 1967, episode of &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; comedy-variety TV series, in the &quot;Mata Hari&quot; skit. She also appeared in NBC&#x27;s famous lost &quot;Tonight Show&quot; Beatles interview that aired on May 14, 1968. Sitting behind the interview desk and beside Joe Garagiola, who was substituting for an absent Johnny Carson, she took an active role during the interview, questioning Paul McCartney and John Lennon. George Harrison and Ringo Starr were not present and were in England at the time, as noted during the interview.

==Personal life==
Bankhead was famous not only as an actress, but also for her many affairs, compelling personality, and witticisms such as, &quot;There is less to this than meets the eye&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m as pure as the driven slush.&quot; She was an extrovert, uninhibited and outspoken, and said that she &quot;lived for the moment&quot;.

Bankhead was an avid baseball fan whose favorite team was the New York Giants. This was evident in one of her famous quotes, through which she gave a nod to the arts: &quot;There have been only two geniuses in the world, Willie Mays and Willie Shakespeare. But, darling, I think you&#x27;d better put Shakespeare first.&quot; Bankhead identified as an Episcopalian despite not being what might then have been called &quot;the typical churchgoing type&quot;.

Bankhead&#x27;s sister, Eugenia, lived in Chestertown, Maryland, near which Bankhead was buried.

===Political activism===
Like her family, Bankhead was a Democrat, but even more than her father, she broke with many Southerners. She supported civil rights and strongly opposed racism and segregation. In the 1924 United States presidential election, Bankhead voted for Robert La Follette of the Progressive Party, but voted for the Democratic presidential nominee at every U.S. presidential election from 1928 to 1968, traveling back to the United States from the United Kingdom in 1924 and 1928 in order to visit her family and to place her vote in person.

In the 1948 presidential election, Bankhead supported the re-election of Harry S. Truman. At the time, Truman faced opposition not just from the Republican Party, but also from splits to his right and to his left from within the Democratic ranks. Bankhead is credited with having helped Truman immeasurably by belittling his rival, New York&#x27;s Governor and Republican presidential candidate Thomas E. Dewey, as Truman defied predictions by defeating Dewey and winning the election. After Truman was elected, Bankhead was invited to sit with the president during his inauguration on January 20, 1949. While viewing the inauguration parade, she booed the South Carolina float which carried governor and segregationist Strom Thurmond, who had recently run against Truman on the Dixiecrat ticket, which had split the Democratic vote by running on a pro-segregationist ticket that appealed to most Southern Democrats.

In Democratic primaries and campaigns of later years, Bankhead supported Estes Kefauver in 1952, Adlai Stevenson II in 1956, John F. Kennedy in 1960, Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 and Eugene McCarthy in 1968. Bankhead would quickly switch to campaigning for the winning Democratic nominee, such as Adlai Stevenson II in 1952 and Hubert Humphrey in 1968, if her original pick failed to win the nomination. She was close friends with Truman, Kefauver, and Stevenson.

===Marriage===
Bankhead married actor John Emery on August 31, 1937, at her father&#x27;s home in Jasper, Alabama. Bankhead filed for divorce in Reno, Nevada, in May 1941. It was finalized on June 13, 1941. That day Bankhead told a reporter, &quot;You can definitely quote me as saying there will be no plans for a remarriage.&quot;

She had no children, but had four abortions before undergoing a hysterectomy in 1933, when she was 31. She was the godmother of Brook and Brockman Seawell, children of her lifelong friend, actress Eugenia Rawls and husband Donald Seawell.

===Sexuality and sexual exploits===
Bankhead had many affairs and spoke openly about her sex life, for example describing herself as &quot;a very satisfied Jane&quot; after sex with Johnny Weissmuller, who played Tarzan, in the pool of the Garden of Allah Hotel. In 1932, controversy arose over an interview that she gave to &quot;Motion Picture&quot; magazine, in which she complained that she had gone too long without an affair:

I&#x27;m serious about love. I&#x27;m damned serious about it now. ... I haven&#x27;t had an affair for six months. Six months! Too long. ... If there&#x27;s anything the matter with me now, it&#x27;s not Hollywood or Hollywood&#x27;s state of mind. ... The matter with me is, I WANT A MAN! ... Six months is a long, long while. I WANT A MAN!

&quot;Time&quot; ran a story about it, angering Bankhead&#x27;s family. Bankhead immediately telegraphed her father, vowing never to speak with a magazine reporter again. For these and other offhand remarks, Bankhead was cited in the Hays Commission&#x27;s &quot;Doom Book&quot;, a list of 150 actors and actresses considered &quot;unsuitable for the public&quot; that was presented to the studios. Bankhead was at the top of the list with the heading: &quot;Verbal Moral Turpitude&quot;.

In her autobiography, published after the release of Alfred Kinsey&#x27;s &quot;Sexual Desire in the Human Male&quot;, she states, &quot;I found no surprises in the Kinsey report. The good doctor&#x27;s clinical notes were old hat to me. ... I&#x27;ve had many momentary love affairs. A lot of these impromptu romances have been climaxed in a fashion not generally condoned. I go into them impulsively. I scorn any notion of their permanence. I forget the fever associated with them when a new interest presents itself.&quot;

In 1934, Bankhead had an affair with the artist Rex Whistler who, according to his biographer Anna Thomasson, lost his virginity to her at the age of 29. Offering him what Thomasson calls &quot;an uncomplicated crash-course in sex&quot;, Bankhead&#x27;s glamour and charisma appealed to the &quot;instinctively submissive Rex&quot;. One afternoon in early 1934, Bankhead&#x27;s friend David Herbert called at her suite at the Hotel Splendide in Piccadilly, only to be informed by her maid that &quot;Miss Bankhead is in the bath with Mr Rex Whistler&quot;. Hearing Herbert&#x27;s voice down the hall, Bankhead reportedly shouted, &quot;I&#x27;m just trying to show Rex I&#x27;m definitely a blonde!&quot;

Rumors about Bankhead&#x27;s sex life have lingered for years. In the 1920s, British domestic spy agency MI5 tried to investigate allegations she had been seducing schoolboys at Eton College but the headmaster refused to cooperate.

In addition to her many affairs with men, she was also linked romantically with female personalities of the day, including Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich, Hattie McDaniel, Beatrice Lillie, Alla Nazimova, Blyth Daly, writers Mercedes de Acosta and Eva Le Gallienne, and singer Billie Holiday. Actress Patsy Kelly confirmed she had a sexual relationship with Bankhead when she worked for her as a personal assistant. John Gruen&#x27;s &quot;Menotti: A Biography&quot; notes an incident in which Jane Bowles chased Bankhead around Capricorn, Gian Carlo Menotti and Samuel Barber&#x27;s Mount Kisco estate, insisting that Bankhead needed to play the lesbian character Inès in Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s &quot;No Exit&quot; (which Paul Bowles had recently translated). Bankhead locked herself in the bathroom and kept insisting, &quot;That lesbian! I wouldn&#x27;t know a thing about it.&quot;

Bankhead never publicly used the term &quot;bisexual&quot; to describe herself, preferring to use the term &quot;ambisextrous&quot; instead.

==Death==

Bankhead moved into 230 East 62nd Street in the late 1950s, and then to a co-op at 333 East 57th Street.

She died at St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital in Manhattan on December 12, 1968, at age 66. The cause of death was pleural double pneumonia. Her pneumonia was complicated by emphysema due to cigarette smoking and malnutrition, but it may also have been made worse by a strain of the Hong Kong flu that was endemic at that time. Her last coherent words reportedly were a garbled request for &quot;codeine ... bourbon&quot;.

Despite claiming to be poor for much of her life, Bankhead left an estate valued at $2 million ().

On December 14, 1968, St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Chestertown, Maryland, held a private funeral. Bankhead was buried at St. Paul&#x27;s cemetery. Two days later, St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Episcopal Church in New York City held a memorial service for Bankhead.

==Legacy==
Bankhead is regarded as one of the great stage actresses of the 20th century, acclaimed for her natural eloquence and dynamism. She excelled in both serious and comedic roles, and for over two decades, she was among the most celebrated actresses in Broadway or London&#x27;s West End, praised in the superlative &quot;perhaps the greatest actress this country has ever produced&quot;. For the most part, Bankhead was lauded even in her failed vehicles, and she was considered by critics to be a rare and unique talent. At the height of her career, she was a &quot;living legend&quot;, Broadway&#x27;s most original leading lady. Her eccentric personality was an asset to her career rather than a hindrance, but as years of hard living took their toll, her highly publicized and often scandalous private life began to undermine her reputation. Obituaries on her passing reflected on how far she had fallen from her former grandeur, à la John Barrymore. The critic Brooks Atkinson was more candid: &quot;Since Miss Bankhead lived as she wanted to, there is no point in deploring the loss of a talented actress&quot;. However, the legend which had ruined her career made her an enormously popular icon in both the theatrical and especially the gay community. Decades of sustained interest in Bankhead eventually realized itself in a renewed appreciation for her body of work.

===Awards and honors===
Among Bankhead&#x27;s awards were a New York Drama Critics Award for Best Performance by an actress in &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot; in 1942, as well as a &quot;Variety&quot; award in &quot;The Little Foxes&quot; and &quot;Skin&quot;. She was nominated for a Tony award for her performance in &quot;Midgie Purvis&quot;, and won the New York Film Critics Award for Best Actress in a Film for her work in &quot;Lifeboat&quot;. Bankhead was the first white woman to be featured on the cover of &quot;Ebony &quot;magazine, and was one of the very few actresses and the only stage actress to have a cover on both &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Life&quot;. In 1928, she was honored as one of the 10 most remarkable women in London. A resolution honoring her achievements was passed in the Alabama Legislature. For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Bankhead has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6141 Hollywood Blvd. Bankhead was (posthumously) one of the original members of the American Theater Hall of Fame inducted upon its establishment in 1972.
===In theatre===
Bankhead earned her greatest acclaim for two classic roles she originated: Regina in Lillian Hellman&#x27;s &quot;The Little Foxes&quot; and Sabina in Thornton Wilder&#x27;s &quot;The Skin of our Teeth&quot;.

At the Algonquin Hotel, Bankhead left prominent impressions upon playwrights such as Zoe Akins and Rachel Crothers. Crothers later wrote the play &quot;Everyday&quot; for Bankhead, and Akins patterned the character of Eva Lovelace in her play &quot;Morning Glory&quot; on Bankhead. She became good friends with Tennessee Williams, who was immediately struck upon meeting her, describing her as &quot;result[ing] from the fantastic crossbreeding of a moth and a tiger&quot;. Williams wrote four female roles for her, Myra Torrance in &quot;Battle of Angels&quot;, Blanche DuBois in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, Princess Kosmonopolis in &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot;, and Flora Goforth in &quot;The Milk Train Doesn&#x27;t Stop Here Anymore&quot;.

A song in the 1937 musical &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Be Right&quot;, &quot;Off the Record&quot;, contains the line &quot;I&#x27;m not so fond of Bankhead, but I&#x27;d love to meet Tallulah&quot;.

&quot;Looped&quot; is a Broadway play by New York writer Matthew Lombardo inspired by an incident which occurred during Bankhead’s last movie role, playing a religious fanatic in the 1965 horror film &quot;Die! Die! My Darling!&quot;. It has been chosen as the debut production of the theatre company based at Holden Street Theatres in Adelaide, South Australia, on 2 May 2023.

===In art===
A collection of 50 portraits of Bankhead in her London years is housed in the United Kingdom&#x27;s National Portrait Gallery.
Augustus John painted a portrait of Bankhead in 1929 which is considered one of his greatest pieces. Frank Dobson also sculpted a bust of Bankhead during her London period.
The Library of Congress houses numerous works of Bankhead.

===Tributes===

A similar tribute was held for a week at the University of Alabama in Birmingham in November 1977.

==In popular culture==

Bankhead left a lasting impact on American culture despite modern audiences being unfamiliar with the stage performances for which she was most acclaimed. Bankhead remains far more prominent in the public imagination than contemporary Broadway actresses of her caliber, and due to her unique personality and often self-destructive behavior.

She has become a frequently imitated camp icon.

Many critics (and Bankhead herself) compared the characterization of Margo Channing in &quot;All About Eve&quot; to that of Bankhead. 
The costume designer Edith Head had explicitly admitted to styling Channing&#x27;s appearance to that of Bankhead.

The 1964 one-act play &quot;Dutchman&quot; by Amiri Baraka has the protagonist address the white woman antagonist by Bankhead&#x27;s name repeatedly.

Bankhead&#x27;s voice and personality inspired voice actress Betty Lou Gerson&#x27;s work on the character Cruella De Vil in Walt Disney Pictures&#x27; &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot;, which the studio calls &quot;a manic take-off on famous actress Tallulah Bankhead&quot;.

The character Tallulah in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; two-part story &quot;Daleks in Manhattan/Evolution of the Daleks&quot;, played by actress Miranda Raison, is likely inspired by Bankhead.

A cocktail at the Ritz Hotel in London is called &quot;The Tallulah&quot;, named for the occasion when Bankhead visited the hotel and drank champagne out of her shoe.

===Fictional portrayals===
* In the 1969 film &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot;, actress Siân Phillips portrays Ursula Mossbank, a character clearly inspired by the Bankhead mystique and mannerisms, but no suggestion is made in the film that that character is supposed to be Bankhead herself.
* Eugenia Rawls developed a one-woman show in 1971, &quot;Tallulah, A Memory&quot;, where she portrayed her &quot;lifetime friend&quot; Bankhead. She later published it as a book of the same title in 1979.
* In the 1980 made-for-television movie, &quot;The Scarlett O&#x27;Hara War&quot;, Carrie Nye plays Bankhead as she and many others vie for the role of Scarlett O&#x27; Hara in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;.
* In the 1983 off-Broadway musical, &quot;Tallulah!&quot;, Helen Gallagher portrays Bankhead&#x27;s life from the early days in Alabama to her New York career and centers on her relationship with her father.
* Rock musician/actor Suzi Quatro portrayed Bankhead in a musical named &quot;Tallulah Who?&quot; in 1991. The musical was based on a book by Willie Rushton. The show ran from February 14 to March 9 at The Queen&#x27;s Theatre, Hornchurch, UK, and received favorable reviews.
* The 1995 documentary &quot;&quot; featured an act entitled The Dueling Bankheads whose drag stars emulate the camp icon&#x27;s exaggerated style.
* Character actor and self stylized &quot;illusionist&quot;, Jim Bailey originated the role of Bankhead in the play &quot;Tallulah and Tennessee&quot; in 1999.
* In her first one-woman show, Kathleen Turner played the titular character in Sandra Ryan Heyward&#x27;s &quot;Tallulah&quot; from 2000 to 2001.
* Valerie Harper starred as Bankhead in &quot;Looped&quot;, which premiered at The Pasadena Playhouse. It opened on Broadway on February 19, 2010, at the Lyceum Theatre.
* In the 2015–2017 series &quot;&quot;, about Bankhead&#x27;s childhood friend Zelda Sayre Fitzgerald, Christina Bennett Lind plays Bankhead.
* Paget Brewster portrayed Bankhead in two episodes of the 2020 Netflix miniseries, &quot;Hollywood&quot;. The show includes a highly fictionalized version of Bankhead and her place in the 1940s Golden Age of Hollywood.
* Bankhead has been variously portrayed by Tovah Feldshuh in both &quot;Tallulah&#x27;s Party&quot;, which opened in 1998 at the Martin R. Kaufman Theater and in Feldshuh and Linda Selman&#x27;s original &quot;Tallulah Hallelujah!&quot;, which opened at the Douglas Fairbanks Theater Off Broadway in 2000.
* Natasha Lyonne portrayed Bankhead in the 2021 Hulu film &quot;The United States vs. Billie Holiday&quot;. The film portrayed Holiday and Bankhead as having a sexual relationship. This relationship is speculative, albeit possible, as the two knew one another and were friends in reality.
* Novelist George Baxt&#x27;s &quot;Jacob Singer&quot; police detective series includes &quot;The Tallulah Bankhead Murder Case&quot; (1987).

<doc id="229823" wikidata="Q5432619" url="?curid=229823" title="False (logic)">
<text>In logic, false or untrue is the state of possessing negative truth value and is a nullary logical connective. In a truth-functional system of propositional logic, it is one of two postulated truth values, along with its negation, truth. Usual notations of the false are 0 (especially in Boolean logic and computer science), O (in prefix notation, O&quot;pq&quot;), and the up tack symbol formula_1.

Another approach is used for several formal theories (e.g., intuitionistic propositional calculus), where a propositional constant (i.e. a nullary connective), formula_1, is introduced, the truth value of which being always false in the sense above. It can be treated as an absurd proposition, and is often called absurdity.

== In classical logic and Boolean logic ==
In Boolean logic, each variable denotes a truth value which can be either true (1), or false (0).

In a classical propositional calculus, each proposition will be assigned a truth value of either true or false. Some systems of classical logic include dedicated symbols for false (0 or formula_1), while others instead rely upon formulas such as and .

In both Boolean logic and Classical logic systems, true and false are opposite with respect to negation; the negation of false gives true, and the negation of true gives false.

The negation of false is equivalent to the truth not only in classical logic and Boolean logic, but also in most other logical systems, as explained below.

== False, negation and contradiction ==
In most logical systems, negation, material conditional and false are related as:
In fact, this is the definition of negation in some systems, such as intuitionistic logic, and can be proven in propositional calculi where negation is a fundamental connective. Because is usually a theorem or axiom, a consequence is that the negation of false () is true.

A contradiction is the situation that arises when a statement that is assumed to be true is shown to entail false (i.e., ). Using the equivalence above, the fact that φ is a contradiction may be derived, for example, from . A statement that entails false itself is sometimes called a contradiction, and contradictions and false are sometimes not distinguished, especially due to the Latin term &quot;&quot; being used in English to denote either, but false is one specific proposition.

Logical systems may or may not contain the principle of explosion (&quot;ex falso quodlibet&quot; in Latin), for all . By that principle, contradictions and false are equivalent, since each entails the other.

== Consistency ==

A formal theory using the &quot;formula_1&quot; connective is defined to be consistent, if and only if the false is not among its theorems. In the absence of , some substitutes (such as the ones described above) may be used instead to define consistency.

<text>Karlsruhe is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in the northwest of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from north clockwise) Rhein-Neckar, Heilbronn,
Enz, Calw, Rastatt, Germersheim, Rhein-Pfalz-Kreis and the district-free city Speyer. The urban district Karlsruhe (&quot;Stadtkreis Karlsruhe&quot;), which contains the City of Karlsruhe, is located in the middle of the district, and partially cuts it into a northern and a southern part.

==History==
The historic origin of the district is the &quot;Oberamt Karlsruhe&quot;. In 1809 it was split into one part responsible for the city Karlsruhe (Stadtamt), and one for the surrounding municipalities (Landamt). In 1865 however both parts were merged again to the &quot;Bezirksamt Karlsruhe&quot;. 1938 it was split again, this time with the district of Karlsruhe for the surrounding part, and the urban district of Karlsruhe for the urban area. In 1973 the district was enlarged by adding the complete district of Bruchsal and parts of the districts Sinsheim, Vaihingen, Pforzheim and Rastatt; some municipalities were also added to the city Karlsruhe and therefore left the district.

Since the founding of the Federal Republic, Karlsruhe has been the seat of the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht), Germany&#x27;s highest.

==Geography==
The western part of the district is located in the Rhine valley. The area in the east belongs to the landscape of the &quot;Kraichgau&quot;, and it is also to the north of the foothills of the Black Forest.

==Coat of arms==
The top-left quarter of the coat of arms shows the symbol of Baden, as a large part of the Karlsruhe district belonged to Baden historically. The cross in the top-right is the symbol of the clerical state of Speyer. The three deer antlers at the bottom-right are the symbol of the state of Württemberg, and at the bottom-left is the symbol of the Wittelsbach family.

==Towns and municipalities==

==Partnerships/Twin regions==
The Karlsruhe district partners with the following sister regions outside of Germany:

* Gwent, United Kingdom (former administrative area in southeast Wales), since 1978. In 1996, due to an administrative reform, Gwent was abolished and divided into five districts, of which Karlsruhe mainly continues the partnership with the new districts of Monmouthshire and Torfaen.
* Sha’ar Hanegev (region in the northwestern Negev, bounded on the west by the Gaza Strip), since 1992
* Brusque, Brazil (city in southern Brazil), since 2011

Within Germany, the Karlsruhe district has a partnership with the Saxon district Mittelsachsen, which was formed in 2008 through a merger of the former districts Döbeln, Freiberg und Mittweida; this relationship dates from 1990 when Karlsruhe district first partnered with Döbeln.

<doc id="229834" wikidata="Q358342" url="?curid=229834" title="Paul Bowles">
<text>Paul Frederic Bowles (; December 30, 1910November 18, 1999) was an American expatriate composer, author, and translator. He became associated with the Moroccan city of Tangier, where he settled in 1947 and lived for 52 years to the end of his life.

Following a cultured middle-class upbringing in New York City, during which he displayed a talent for music and writing, Bowles pursued his education at the University of Virginia before making several trips to Paris in the 1930s. He studied music with Aaron Copland, and in New York wrote music for theatrical productions, as well as other compositions. He achieved critical and popular success with his first novel &quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot; (1949), set in French North Africa, which he had visited in 1931.

In 1947, Bowles settled in Tangier, at that time in the Tangier International Zone, and his wife Jane Bowles followed in 1948. Except for winters spent in Ceylon during the early 1950s, Tangier was Bowles&#x27;s home for the remainder of his life. He came to symbolize American immigrants in the city.

Bowles died in 1999 at the age of 88. His ashes are buried near family graves in Lakemont Cemetery, in upstate New York.

==Life==

===1910–1930: family and education===
Paul Bowles was born in Jamaica, Queens, New York City, as the only child of Rena (née Winnewisser) and Claude Dietz Bowles, a dentist. His childhood was materially comfortable, but his father was a cold and domineering parent, opposed to any form of play or entertainment, and feared by both his son and wife. According to family legend, Claude had tried to kill his newborn son by leaving him exposed on a window-ledge during a snowstorm. The story may not be true, but Bowles believed it was and that it encapsulated his relationship with his father. Warmth in his childhood was provided by his mother, who read Nathaniel Hawthorne and Edgar Allan Poe to him – it was to the latter that he later attributed his own desire to write stories, such as &quot;The Delicate Prey&quot;, &quot;A Distant Episode&quot;, and &quot;Pages from Cold Point&quot;.

Bowles could read at age 3 and was writing stories by age 4. Soon, he wrote surrealistic poetry and music. In 1922, at age 11, he bought his first book of poetry, Arthur Waley&#x27;s &quot;A Hundred and Seventy Chinese Poems&quot;. At age 17, he had a poem, &quot;Spire Song&quot;, accepted for publication in the literary journal &quot;transition&quot;. This Paris-based publication served as a forum for leading proponents of modernism – Djuna Barnes, James Joyce, Paul Éluard, Gertrude Stein and others. Bowles&#x27;s interest in music also dated from his childhood, when his father bought a phonograph and classical records. (Bowles was interested in jazz, but such records were forbidden by his father.) His family bought a piano, and the young Bowles studied musical theory, singing, and piano. When he was 15, he attended a performance of Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Firebird&quot; at Carnegie Hall, which made a profound impression: &quot;Hearing &quot;The Firebird&quot; made me determined to continue improvising on the piano when my father was out of the house, and to notate my own music with an increasing degree of knowing that I had happened upon a new and exciting mode of expression.&quot; Bowles attended Jamaica High School in Queens, NY.

Bowles entered the University of Virginia in 1928, where his interests included T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot;, Prokofiev, Duke Ellington, Gregorian chant, and blues. He also heard music by George Antheil and Henry Cowell. In April 1929, he dropped out without informing his parents, and sailed with a one-way ticket for Paris and no intention of returning – not, he said later, running away, but &quot;running toward something, although I didn&#x27;t know what at the time.&quot; Bowles spent the next months working for the &quot;Paris Herald Tribune&quot; and developing a friendship with the Romanian poet Tristan Tzara. By July, he returned to New York and worked at Duttons Bookshop in Manhattan, where he began work on an unfinished book of fiction, &quot;Without Stopping&quot; (not to be confused with his later autobiography of the same title).

At the insistence of his parents, Bowles returned to studies at the University of Virginia but left after one semester to return to Paris with Aaron Copland, with whom he had been studying composition in New York. Copland was a lover as well as mentor to Bowles, who would later state that he was &quot;other than Jane the most important person in my life&quot;: when their affair concluded, they remained friends for life.

It was during the autumn of 1930 in Paris that Bowles began work on his own first musical composition, the &quot;Sonata for Oboe and Clarinet&quot;, which he finished the following year. It premiered in New York at the Aeolian Hall on Wigmore Street, December 16, 1931. The entire concert (which also included work by Copland and Virgil Thomson) was panned by New York critics. (Bowles&#x27;s first-known composition was completed earlier in Berlin: an adaptation as piano music of some vocal pieces by Kurt Schwitters.)

===1931–1946: France and New York===
In Paris, Bowles became a part of Gertrude Stein&#x27;s literary and artistic circle. On her advice, he made his first visit to Tangier with Aaron Copland in the summer of 1931. They took a house on the mountain above Tangier Bay. Bowles later made Morocco his full-time home, and it inspired many of his short stories. From Tangier he returned to Berlin, where he met British writers Stephen Spender and Christopher Isherwood. (Isherwood was reportedly so taken with him that he named a character Sally Bowles in his novel after him.) The next year, Bowles returned to North Africa, traveling through other parts of Morocco, the Sahara, Algeria, and Tunisia.

In 1937, Bowles returned to New York. Over the next decade, he established a solid reputation as a composer, collaborating with Orson Welles, Tennessee Williams, and others on music for stage productions, as well as orchestral pieces.

In 1938, he married Jane Auer, an author and playwright. It was an unconventional marriage; their intimate relationships were reportedly with people of their own sex, but the couple maintained close personal ties with each other. During this time the couple joined the Communist Party of USA but soon left the organization after Bowles was ejected from the party.

Bowles has frequently been featured in anthologies as a gay writer, although he regarded such categories as both absurd and irrelevant. After a brief sojourn in France, the couple were prominent among the literary figures of New York throughout the 1940s. They briefly lived in February House in late 1939, using burlesque dancer Gypsy Rose Lee&#x27;s room while she was performing in Chicago, but clashed with Benjamin Britten over use of the piano for composing, and other housemates over their noisy bedroom fantasies. Bowles also worked under Virgil Thomson as a music critic at the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;. His zarzuela, &quot;The Wind Remains&quot;, based on a poem by Federico García Lorca, was performed in 1943 with choreography by Merce Cunningham and conducted by Leonard Bernstein. His translation of Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s play &quot;Huis Clos&quot; (&quot;No Exit&quot;), directed by John Huston, won a Drama Critic&#x27;s Award in 1943.

In 1945, Bowles began writing prose again, beginning with a few short stories including &quot;A Distant Episode&quot;. His wife Jane, he said, was the main influence upon his taking up fiction as an adult, when she published her first novel &quot;Two Serious Ladies&quot; (1943).

===1947–1956: early years in Tangier===
In 1947, Bowles received a contract for a novel from Doubleday; with the advance, he moved permanently to Tangier. Jane joined him there the following year. Bowles commented:

Bowles traveled alone into the Algerian Sahara to work on the novel. He later said, &quot;I wrote in bed in hotels in the desert.&quot; He drew inspiration from personal experience, noting years later that, &quot;Whatever one writes is in a sense autobiographical, of course. Not factually so, but poetically so.&quot; He titled the novel &quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot;, from a song, &quot;Down Among the Sheltering Palms&quot;, which he had heard every summer as a child. It was first published by John Lehmann Limited in England, in September 1949, after Doubleday rejected the manuscript.

Bowles recalled:
A first American edition, by New Directions Publishing, appeared the following month. The plot follows three Americans: Port, his wife Kit, and their friend, Tunner, as they journey through the Algerian desert. The reviewer for &quot;TIME&quot; magazine commented that the ends visited upon the two main characters &quot;seem appropriate but by no means tragic&quot;, but that &quot;Bowles scores cleanly with his minor characters: Arab pimps and prostitutes, French officers in garrison towns, [and] a stupidly tiresome pair of tourists—mother &amp; son.&quot; In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, playwright and critic Tennessee Williams commented that the book was like a summer thunderstorm, &quot;pulsing with interior flashes of fire&quot;. The book quickly rose to the &quot;New York Times&quot; best-seller list, going through three printings in two months.

In 1950, Bowles published his first collection of short stories. Titled &quot;A Little Stone&quot; (John Lehmann, London, August 1950), it omitted two of Bowles&#x27;s most famous short stories, &quot;Pages From Cold Point&quot; and &quot;The Delicate Prey&quot;. British critic Cyril Connolly and writer Somerset Maugham had advised him that if they were included in the collection, distribution and/or censorship difficulties might ensue. The American edition by Random House, &quot;The Delicate Prey and Other Stories&quot; (November 1950), did include these two stories.

In an interview 30 years later, Bowles responded to an observation that almost all of the characters in &quot;The Delicate Prey&quot; were victimized by either physical or psychological violence. He said:
He set his second novel, &quot;Let It Come Down&quot; (John Lehmann, London, February 1952), in North Africa, specifically Tangier. It explored the disintegration of an American (Nelson Dyar) who was unprepared for the encounter with an alien culture. The first American edition by Random House was published later that same month.

Bowles set his third novel, &quot;The Spider&#x27;s House&quot; (Random House, New York, November 1955), in Fez, immediately prior to Morocco&#x27;s gaining independence and sovereignty in 1956. In it, he charted the relationships among three immigrants and a young Moroccan: John Stenham, Alain Moss, Lee Veyron, and Amar. Reviewers noted that the novel marked a departure from Bowles&#x27;s earlier fiction in that it introduced a contemporary political theme, the conflict between Moroccan nationalism and French colonialism. The UK edition (Macdonald) was published in January 1957.

While Bowles was concentrating on his career as a writer, he composed incidental music for nine plays presented by the American School of Tangier. The Bowles couple became fixtures of the American and European immigrant scene in Tangier. Visitors included Truman Capote, Joseph Glasco, Tennessee Williams and Gore Vidal. William S. Burroughs, and the Beat writers Allen Ginsberg and Gregory Corso followed in the mid-1950s and early 1960s. In 1951, Bowles was introduced to the Master Musicians of Jajouka, having first heard the musicians when he and Brion Gysin attended a festival, or &quot;moussem&quot;, at Sidi Kacem. Bowles described his continued association with the Master Musicians of Jajouka and their hereditary leader Bachir Attar in his book, &quot;Days: A Tangier Journal&quot;.

In 1952, Bowles bought the tiny island of Taprobane, off the coast of Ceylon. There, he wrote much of his novel &quot;The Spider&#x27;s House&quot; and returned to Tangier in the warmer months. He stayed in Sri Lanka most winters.

===1957–1973: Moroccan music and translation===
In 1957, Jane Bowles had a mild stroke, which marked the beginning of a prolonged decline in her health. Her condition preoccupied Paul Bowles until Jane&#x27;s death in 1973.

During the late 1950s, Morocco achieved independence. With a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation and sponsorship from the US Library of Congress, Bowles spent the months of August to September 1959 traveling throughout Morocco with Christopher Wanklyn and Mohammed Larbi, recording traditional Moroccan music. From 1959 to 1961, Bowles recorded a wide variety of music from the different ethnic groups in Morocco, including the Sephardic Jewish communities of Meknes and Essaouira.

During these years, Bowles also worked at translating Moroccan authors and story-tellers, including Mohamed Choukri, Ahmed Yacoubi, Larbi Layachi (under the pseudonym Driss ben Hamed Charhadi), and Mohammed Mrabet.

In the autumn of 1968, invited by friend Oliver Evans, Bowles was a visiting scholar for one semester at the English Department of the San Fernando Valley State College, (now California State University, Northridge). He taught &quot;Advanced Narrative Writing and the Modern European Novel.&quot;

In 1970, Bowles and Daniel Halpern founded the literary magazine &quot;Antaeus,&quot; based in Tangier. It featured many new, as well as established authors. Bowles&#x27;s work was also represented, including his story &quot;Afternoon with Antaeus.&quot;

===1974–1995: later years===
After his wife&#x27;s death, on May 4, 1973, in Málaga, Spain, Bowles continued to live in Tangier. He wrote regularly and received many visitors to his modest apartment.

In the summers of 1980 and 1982, Bowles conducted writing workshops in Morocco, at the American School of Tangier (under the auspices of the School of Visual Arts in New York). These were considered successful. Among several students who have become successful authors are Rodrigo Rey Rosa, the 2004 Winner of the Miguel Ángel Asturias National Prize in Literature, and Mark Terrill. Bowles designated Rey Rosa as the literary heir of his and Jane Bowles&#x27;s estates.

In 1982, Bowles published &quot;Points in Time&quot;, subtitled &quot;Tales From Morocco&quot;, a collection of stories. Divided into eleven parts, the work consists of untitled story fragments, anecdotes, and travel narratives. These stories are not included in either &quot;The Stories of Paul Bowles&quot; (Ecco Press) or &quot;Collected Stories and Later Writings&quot; (The Library of America).

Also in 1982, Paul Bowles worked with Karren Alenier on several of the Stein poems associated with her opera libretto &quot;Gertrude Stein Invents A Jump Early On.&quot;

In 1985, Bowles published his translation of Jorge Luis Borges&#x27;s short story, &quot;The Circular Ruins&quot;. It was collected in a book of 16 stories, all translated by Bowles, called &quot;She Woke Me Up So I Killed Her&quot;. This Borges story had previously been published in translations by the three main Borges translators: Anthony Kerrigan, Anthony Bonner, and James E. Irby.

In 1988, when Bowles was asked in an interview about his social life, he replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what a social life is ... My social life is restricted to those who serve me and give me meals, and those who want to interview me.&quot; When asked in the same interview how he would summarize his achievement, he said, &quot;I&#x27;ve written some books and some music. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve achieved.&quot;

Bowles had a cameo appearance at the beginning and end of the film version of &quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot; (1990), directed by Bernardo Bertolucci. Bowles&#x27;s music was overlooked and mostly forgotten for more than a generation, but in the 1990s, a new generation of American musicians and singers became interested in his work again. Art song enthusiasts savor what are described as &quot;charming, witty pieces.&quot;
In 1994, Bowles was visited and interviewed by writer Paul Theroux, who featured him in his last chapter of his travel book, &quot;The Pillars of Hercules&quot;.

===1995–1999: final years===
In 1995, Bowles made his final return to New York, invited to a &quot;Paul Bowles Festival&quot; at Lincoln Center celebrating his music. The music was performed by Jonathan Sheffer leading the Eos Orchestra. A related symposium on Bowles&#x27;s work and interview were held at the New School for Social Research. A Canadian documentary on his life, &quot;Let It Come Down: The Life of Paul Bowles&quot; won Best Documentary at the 27th Annual International Emmy Awards in New York City.

Visitors in 1998 reported that Bowles&#x27;s wit and intellect endured. He continued to welcome visitors to his apartment in Tangier but, on the advice of doctors and friends, limited interviews. One of the last was an interview with Stephen Morison, Jr., a friend teaching at the American School of Tangier. It was featured in the July/August 1999 issue of &quot;Poets &amp; Writers&quot; magazine. On June 6, 1999, Irene Herrmann, the executrix of the Paul Bowles Music Estate, interviewed him to focus on his musical career; this was published in September 2003.

Bowles died of heart failure on November 18, 1999, at the Italian Hospital in Tangier, aged 88. He had been ill for some time with respiratory problems. His ashes were buried in Lakemont, New York, next to the graves of his parents and grandparents.

==Bowles and Tangier==
Paul Bowles lived for 52 of his 88 years in Tangier. He became strongly identified with the city and symbolized American immigrants. Obituary writers typically linked his life to his residency there.

When Bowles had first visited Tangier with Aaron Copland in 1931, they were both outsiders to what they perceived as an exotic place of unfamiliar customs. They were not bound by any local rules, which varied among the many ethnic groups. Tangier was a Moroccan and international city, a longtime trading center, with a population made up of Berber, Arab, Spanish, French and other Europeans, speaking Spanish, French, Berber and Arabic, and professing a variety of religions. Politically it was under the control of a consortium of foreign powers, including the United States. Bowles was entranced by the city&#x27;s culture.

By his return in 1947 the city somewhat changed, but he still found it intriguing. In 1955, anti-European riots erupted as Moroccans sought independence. In 1956, the city was returned to full Moroccan control.

==Music==

===Introduction===
Paul Bowles first studied music with Aaron Copland. In the fall of 1931, following an introduction from Copland, he entered the studio of Virgil Thomson.

Bowles had thought of himself first as a poet, having published some verse in his brief time at the University of Virginia in the pages of &quot;transition&quot;. Unfortunately, the quality of his poetry eluded any of the intellectuals he would later encounter in Paris. Among them was Gertrude Stein, from whom he received the sobriquet, &quot;the manufactured savage,&quot; and who begged him to give up writing poetry.

However, his music of the time, demonstrated by a propensity for Ravel-like piano improvisations, charmed both Copland and Thomson, alike. In his book, &quot;Copland On Music&quot; (Doubleday &amp; Company, New York, 1960), Copland remarked:

For Copland the allure of Bowles&#x27;s music would never diminish. In later years he was recorded as having said, &quot;Paul Bowles&#x27; music is always fresh; I&#x27;ve never known him to write a dull piece.&quot;

However, the precocity of Bowles&#x27;s early musical efforts would later belie a lack of professional training and discipline. Copland had tried in New York to teach him harmony, but had found him to be a stubborn pupil. In Paris Bowles approached Nadia Boulanger for lessons, and Thomson recommended him to Paul Dukas. In the end, he would work with neither.

===Development===
Apart from irregular consultation with Vittorio Rieti, Bowles never received any formal instruction in music, despite the best efforts of Aaron Copland and Virgil Thomson to persuade him otherwise. However, the self-taught composer, with assistance from Thomson, found success in New York as a producer of incidental music for the theatre. He collaborated with the likes of George Balanchine, Joseph Losey, Leonard Bernstein, Elia Kazan, Arthur Koestler, José Ferrer, Salvador Dalí, Orson Welles, William Saroyan and Tennessee Williams.

During the Second World War he turned his hand to writing as a reviewer for the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, where Thomson then served as music critic. Bowles was well-suited to the work, according to Thomson, &quot;because he wrote clearly and because he had the gift of judgment.&quot;

Following Virgil Thomson&#x27;s retirement from his critic&#x27;s post in 1954, reminiscing on his wish Paul Bowles had taken over the position, Bowles remarked, &quot;I don&#x27;t think I could have handled it, any more than I could have followed a career in composition. I lacked the musical training that [Virgil] and Aaron had.&quot;

===A new direction===
After the war, eventually settling in Tangier, Morocco, Bowles continued his musical and literary pursuits, gradually letting go of the former and becoming what Virgil Thomson described as, &quot;a novelist and story writer of international repute.&quot;

Paul Bowles referred to Tangier as &quot;a place where it is still hard to find a piano in tune.&quot; Regarding his establishment as an author in Morocco, Bowles said:

With the success of the book, &quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot;, Bowles struck his first blow for independence. In time this break from the composition of music would see Bowles&#x27;s earlier exploits overshadowed completely by his acclaim as a writer of prose.

===Recapitulation===
Only in the decade before his death was there a renewed interest in his musical output from the 1930s and &#x27;40s. This movement may have culminated in May 1994, at the Théâtre du Rond-Point in Paris, with the presentation of a live concert performance, and at which the then 83-year-old Paul Bowles was in attendance. The program included a number of Bowles&#x27;s original songs and pieces for piano, plus musical tributes and portraits of the composer by Virgil Thomson, Leonard Bernstein, and Phillip Ramey. At least as regards the past neglect of his own catalogue, this ongoing revival may serve as proof of Bowles&#x27;s own words: &quot;Music only exists when it is played.&quot;

Renewal of respect for Paul Bowles&#x27;s music has led to several commercial recording projects. In 2016 the Invencia Piano Duo (Andrey Kasparov and Oksana Lutsyshyn), in collaboration with Naxos Records and its American Classics division, released two CDs of Bowles&#x27;s complete piano works.

Volume one opens with pieces inspired by Latin American themes, evocative of the composer&#x27;s interest in the culture and his fluency in the Spanish language. The second of the two volumes closes with arrangements of &quot;Blue Mountain Ballads&quot; (1946), set for piano duet by Dr. Andrey Kasparov, and three miscellaneous pieces, set for two pianos by the American piano duo of Arthur Gold and Robert Fizdale. The latter three arrangements were uncovered in the Gold and Fizdale Collection, held in the Peter Jay Sharp Special Collections, Lila Acheson Wallace Library, The Juilliard School. Dr. Kasparov reconstructed the original manuscripts which permitted these duets to be recorded for the very first time.

===Recording of Moroccan music===
Paul Bowles was a pioneer in the field of North African ethnomusicology, making field recordings from 1959 to 1961 of traditional Moroccan music for the US Library of Congress. In five months, he managed to document 250 examples, covering some of the most significant Moroccan music genres. The collection includes dance music, secular music, music for Ramadan and other celebrations, and music for animistic rituals. Bowles realised that modern culture would inevitably change and influence the practice of traditional music, and he wanted to preserve some of it.

Bowles commented on the political aspects of the practice of traditional music:

The total collection of this recorded music is known as &quot;The Paul Bowles Collection&quot;; it is archived in the US Library of Congress, Reference No. 72-750123. The Archival Manuscript Material (Collection) contains 97 x 2-track 7&quot; reel-to-reel tapes, containing approximately sixty hours of traditional folk, art and popular music, one box of manuscripts, 18 photographs, and a map, along with the 2-LP recording called &quot;Music of Morocco&quot; (AFS L63-64).

==Translating other authors==
In the 1960s Bowles began translating and collecting stories from the oral tradition of native Moroccan storytellers. His most noteworthy collaborators included Mohammed Mrabet, Driss Ben Hamed Charhadi (Larbi Layachi), Mohamed Choukri, Abdeslam Boulaich, and Ahmed Yacoubi.

He also translated writers whose original work was written in Spanish, Portuguese and French: Rodrigo Rey Rosa, Jorge Luis Borges, Jean-Paul Sartre, Isabelle Eberhardt, Roger Frison-Roche, André Pieyre de Mandiargues, Ramón Gómez de la Serna, Giorgio de Chirico, Si Lakhdar, E. Laoust, Ramon Beteta, Gabino Chan, Bertrand Flornoy, Jean Ferry, Denise Moran, Paul Colinet, Paul Magritte, Popul Buj, Francis Ponge, Bluet d&#x27;Acheres and Ramon Sender.

==Achievement and legacy==
Paul Bowles is considered one of the artists to have shaped 20th-century literature and music. In his &quot;Introduction&quot; to Bowles&#x27;s &quot;Collected Stories&quot; (1979) Gore Vidal ranked the short stories as &quot;among the best ever written by an American&quot;, writing: &quot;the floor to this ramshackle civilization that we have built cannot bear much longer our weight. It was Bowles&#x27;s genius to suggest the horrors which lie beneath that floor, as fragile, in its way, as the sky that shelters us from a devouring vastness&quot;.

Critics have described his music, in contrast, &quot;as full of light as the fiction [is] of dark ... almost as if the composer were a totally different person from the writer.&quot; During the early 1930s, Bowles studied composition (intermittently) with Aaron Copland; his music from this period &quot;is reminiscent of Satie and Poulenc.&quot; Returning to New York in the mid-30s, Bowles became one of the preeminent composers of American theater music, producing works for William Saroyan, Tennessee Williams, and others, &quot;show[ing] exceptional skill and imagination in capturing the mood, emotion, and ambience of each play to which he was assigned.&quot; Bowles said that such incidental music allowed him to present &quot;climaxless music, hypnotic music in one of the exact senses of the word, in that it makes its effect without the spectator being made aware of it.&quot; At the same time he continued to write concert music, assimilating some of the melodic, rhythmic, and other stylistic elements of African, Mexican, and Central American music.

In 1991, Bowles was awarded the annual Rea Award for the Short Story. The jury gave the following citation: &quot;Paul Bowles is a storyteller of the utmost purity and integrity. He writes of a world before God became man; a world in which men and women in extremis are seen as components in a larger, more elemental drama. His prose is crystalline and his voice unique. Among living American masters of the short story, Paul Bowles is sui generis.&quot;

The historic building of the American Legation in Tangier includes an entire wing devoted to Paul Bowles. In 2010, they received a donation of furniture, photographs and documents compiled by Gloria Kirby, a permanent resident of Tanger and friend of Bowles.

The Library of America published an edition of Bowles&#x27;s works in 2002.

==Works==
In addition to his chamber and stage compositions, Bowles published fourteen short story collections, several novels, three volumes of poetry, numerous translations, numerous travel articles, and an autobiography.

<text>The Tupolev Tu-114 Rossiya (; NATO reporting name Cleat) is a retired large turboprop-powered long-range airliner designed by the Tupolev design bureau and built in the Soviet Union from May 1955. The aircraft was the largest and fastest passenger plane at that time and also had the longest range, at 10,900 km (6,800 mi). It has held the official title of fastest propeller-driven aircraft since 1960.

Due to its swept wing and powerplant design, the Tu-114 was able to travel at speeds typical of modern jetliners, . Although it was able to accommodate 224 passengers, when operated by Aeroflot, it was more common to accommodate 170 passengers with sleeping berths and a dining lounge.

The Tu-114 carried over six million passengers before being replaced by the jet-powered Ilyushin Il-62. Thirty-two aircraft were built at the Kuibyshev aviation plant (No.18) in the early 1960s.

==Development==
In response to a directive No.1561-868 from the Council of Ministers and Ministry of Aircraft Production order No.571, issued in August 1955, the Tupolev Design Bureau was to create an airliner that had a range of 8,000 km (4,971 mi), based on the Tupolev Tu-95 strategic bomber, powered by four Kuznetsov NK-12 engines driving contra-rotating propellers.

The Tu-114 used the basic wing, empennage, landing gear, and powerplants of the Tu-95 bomber, mated to a totally new pressurized fuselage of much larger diameter. To cope with the increased weight, increased landing flap surface area was required, and the flap chord was increased compared to the bomber&#x27;s flaps. The wing was mounted low on the fuselage, giving the Tu-114 a much higher stance on its landing gear than the bomber. As a result, a new nose landing gear strut was required, although the main landing gear remained unchanged.

The Tu-114 was able to reach speeds typical of modern jetliners (880 km/h), but its cruising speed equivalent to Mach 0.71 was markedly lower than equivalent jet airliners such as the Boeing 707, Douglas DC-8, and Vickers VC10, which usually cruised at Mach 0.83. It carried up to 224 passengers in maximum carriage configuration, although a more usual number for long-distance transcontinental flights was 170 passengers, which enabled the planes to be fitted with such luxuries as sleeping berths and even a dining lounge for the upper-class cabin.

==Design==

The Tu-114 had several unique features for its time, such as:
* Wings swept back at 35 degrees — the same angle as for the Boeing 707 and several other pure turbojet-powered airliners
* The most powerful turboprop engines to enter service on any aircraft, the Kuznetsov NK-12MV, each driving two AV-60H, contra-rotating, four-bladed, reversible-pitch propellers.
* Lower deck galleys. A dumbwaiter connected the galley to the upper deck; originally, a member of the crew was a chef.
* Lower deck aircrew rest area.
* Long landing gear (the nose gear was 3 meters high) due to a combination of a low wing and its large propeller diameter. Many destination airports did not have steps tall enough to reach the Tu-114&#x27;s cabin door because of this.

The Tu-114s was a rare example of a plane with a dual-use layout — as a commercial airliner and for government transportation. The same dual-purpose layout was used in the first Tu-104s. The Tu-114 had four sleeping compartments with three berths in each, and a &quot;restaurant&quot; cabin in the midsection of the aircraft — the loudest section on the aircraft — with eight tables, each of which had six seats in a face-to-face arrangement. During official flights the middle cabin was used as a restaurant for dining. VIPs like Nikita Khrushchev and his wife travelled in the sleeping compartments, with their staff and entourage in two tourist class cabins with 3+3 layout. Front cabins had 41 seats (first row 2+3), and the aft cabin had 54 seats.

On domestic flights all seats were sold at one price; there was no class difference in the USSR during the Tu-114&#x27;s flying career. The most uncomfortable places on the plane were in the &quot;restaurant&quot; compartments (six seats instead three sleeping berths), these were sold last. Three places in row 16, near the stair to the lower deck were equipped with baby bassinets. Maximum seating capacity of the Tu-114 in its &quot;native&quot; configuration was 170 passengers.

For international flights, sleeping places were sold as first class. In the early 1970s, sleeping compartments and the &quot;restaurant&quot; on most Tu-114s (excluding three or four) were dismantled and replaced with the usual passenger seats, with maximum seating reaching 200. 

The design was not without shortcomings. Passengers on the Tu-114 endured high noise levels (108–112 dB) and vibrations from the propellers and engines.

==Operational history==
The first Tu-114, registration СССР-Л5611, was first shown to the West in 1958 at the Brussels World Exhibition. It later carried Nikita Khrushchev on his first trip to the United States in September 1959, the first such visit by any Soviet leader. The Tu-114 was still in the testing phase and had completed its first long range flight only four months earlier, after which postflight analysis found that hairline cracks had formed in the engines. Trusting the Soviet leadership to a still experimental aircraft was risky, but the only other option for a flight to the United States would be the short range Il-18 which would require multiple fueling stops. Although the Central Committee, Minister of Defense Malinovsky, and Khrushchev&#x27;s personal pilot all considered it too risky to use the new aircraft, the Soviet premier insisted and aircraft designer Andrei Tupolev felt confident enough to put his son Alexei on the same flight. During Khrushchev&#x27;s flight, a group of engineers were aboard the plane, operating diagnostic equipment to monitor the engines and verify that they were functioning correctly. Khrushchev later said, &quot;We didn&#x27;t publicize the fact that Tupolev&#x27;s son was with us&quot; for &quot;to do so, would have meant giving explanations, and these might have been damaging to our image&quot;. When it arrived at Andrews Air Force Base, the ground crew found that the aircraft was so large and its landing gear so tall that they had no passenger steps high enough to reach the forward hatch. Khrushchev and his party were obliged to use the aircraft&#x27;s own emergency escape ladder. The last flight of this particular plane was in 1968, and it is now on display at the Central Air Force Museum at Monino, outside of Moscow. Similar issues were experienced when the plane first landed at London and Paris airports, neither of which had hosted a plane of this size.

The Tu-114 entered regular Aeroflot service on flights from Vnukovo Airport in Moscow to Khabarovsk on 24 April 1961. It was subsequently used for Aeroflot flights to international destinations including Copenhagen, Havana, Montreal, New Delhi, Paris, Belgrade and Tokyo (in co-operation with JAL).

Flights to Havana via Conakry in Guinea began on 10 July 1962. After the United States government placed political pressure on Guinea, landing rights were denied after four flights, and the Tu-114 service had to be routed through Dakar, Senegal, instead. Further American pressure to isolate Cuba resulted in denial of landing rights after three flights, and the route was changed to Algiers, Algeria, instead. After three more flights, Algiers was also closed to the Tu-114. To overcome this, the Tu-114 was specially modified into the long-range Tu-114D variant, with seating reduced from 170 to 60, and 15 extra fuel tanks added. These aircraft refuelled at Olenya near Murmansk, in the far North of the Soviet Union, and then flew via the Barents Sea to Havana. Usually, this fuel load was enough, but in case of strong headwinds, an emergency refuelling stop in Nassau in The Bahamas was necessary; this was an American military field. All planes operating this route were converted back to normal specifications after the jet-powered Ilyushin Il-62 began flying the Moscow–Havana route.

Aeroflot first appeared in the OAG registry in the January 1967 issue, which shows:

* a weekly Tu-114 from Sheremetyevo to Montreal, scheduled 11 hours 50 minutes (YUL to SVO was 10:30)
* two weekly Tu-114s to Havana in 19:20, returning in 16:25
* one weekly Tu-114 to Delhi in 7:00, returning in 7:40

The May 1967 OAG adds the weekly flight to Tokyo, taking 10:35 hours and the return to SVO in 11:25 hours.

Ilyushin 62s took over the Delhi and Montreal flights in 1967 (though the August 1968 OAG shows a weekly SVO-YUL-HAV Tu-114 along with a weekly Tu-114 via Algiers). Ilyushins took over the Tokyo flight in May/June 1969 and Havana, probably sometime in 1969.

With the increasing use of the Il-62, the Tu-114s were shifted to long domestic flights from Domodedovo to Alma-Ata, Tashkent, Novosibirsk and Khabarovsk. Tu-114s were also used for charter operations for senior officials of the USSR and various official delegations.

The Tu-114 had a short commercial service life compared with other Soviet airliners, being operated on regular flights from 1961 to 1976 (in comparison, the Il-62 is still in civilian service 52 years after its introduction, as of 2019). The fatigue life of the airframe was set at 14,000 flying hours. Most of the aircraft passed this point in 1976. By the summer of 1977, Aeroflot decided to scrap 21 aircraft at the same time. A few continued in use by the Soviet Air Forces until 1991.

Although the time in service was relatively brief, the Tu-114, during its time in service, managed to earn an excellent reputation for reliability, speed and fuel economy. Tu-114 burned 5,000-5,500 kg/hour of fuel at cruise flight, which is comparable to a modern wide-body twinjet, such as a Boeing 787 Dreamliner or Airbus A350 XWB. Its safety record was rarely matched: there was only one accident involving fatalities, but the plane was not airborne at the time. It was only withdrawn from service after the introduction of the Il-62 and after carrying over six million passengers with Aeroflot and Japan Airlines.

===JAL service===
For the Moscow–Tokyo route, Japan Air Lines made an agreement with Aeroflot to use the Tu-114. The flight crew included one JAL member, and the cabin crew consisted of five each from Aeroflot and JAL. The seating was changed to a two-class layout with 105 seats, and the aircraft livery included a small JAL logo and lettering on the forward fuselage. The first flight was on April 17, 1967. In 1969, the Moscow–Tokyo Tu-114 flights ended and the four involved planes converted back to the 200-seat domestic layout.
===World records===
In June 1959 the Aviation Sports Committee of the Central Air Club named after Valeriy P. Chkalov approached the Tupolev OKB suggesting that various aviation records could be taken by Tupolev-designed aircraft. The Tupolev OKB prepared a detailed plan for record attempts on the Tu-16, Tu-104, Tu-104B, Tu-95M and Tu-114. The second preproduction Tu-114 (СССР-76459) was prepared and clearance obtained to fly with the 30-tonne (metric ton) payload required for some of the record attempts.

In a series of flights beginning on 24 March 1960 the Tu-114 achieved the following records in Sub-class C-1 (landplanes) Group 2 (turboprop):

;24 March 1960
:Maximum speed on a closed circuit with payloads of 
:Pilot: Ivan Sukhomlin (USSR)
:Captain: B. Timochuk + 4 other crew
:Course/place: Sternberg Astronomical Institute

;1 April 1960
:Maximum speed on a closed circuit with payloads of 
:Pilot: Ivan Sukhomlin (USSR)
:2nd pilot: N. Kharitonov + 3 other crew
:Course/place: Sternberg-Point Observatory (USSR)
:Tu-114 &#x27;76459&#x27;

;9 April 1960
:Maximum speed on a closed circuit with payloads of 
:Pilot: Ivan Sukhomlin (USSR)
:2nd pilot: Konstantin Sapelkin (2nd pilot)
:Course/place: Sternberg-Point Observatory (USSR)
:Tu-114 &#x27;76459&#x27;

;12 July 1961
:Altitude with payloads of 
:Pilot: Ivan Sukhomlin (USSR)
:2nd pilot: Piotr Soldatov
:Course/place: Vnukovo (USSR)

;21 April 1962
:Maximum speed on a closed circuit with payloads of 
:Pilot: Ivan Sukhomlin (USSR)
:2nd pilot: P. Soldatov
:Course/place: Sternberg-Point Observatory (USSR)
:Tu-114 &#x27;76467&#x27;

All these records stand, but the category was discontinued when the category was split into takeoff weight sub-groups. Similar records have been set in the new sub-groups by Tu-95 and Tu-142 aircraft at faster speeds.

==Variants==

==Accidents and incidents==

During its service life, the Tu-114 had only one fatal accident. On 17 February 1966, Aeroflot Flight 065 attempted to take off from Moscow Sheremetyevo Airport at night in deteriorating weather conditions, after the flight had been delayed several times. The crew was unaware that snow had not been properly cleared from the full width of the runway involved. The plane&#x27;s wing struck a large snow mound at speed and the propellers of the number 3 and 4 engines hit the runway, resulting in the aircraft veering off course and catching fire. Initial Soviet sources suggested that 48 of the 70 persons on board were killed, including the pilot. The aircraft was bound for Brazzaville, Republic of the Congo with a number of Africans and a Soviet trade delegation on board. Later reports give the fatalities as 21 of 48 on board.

Another non-operational aircraft was written off, with fuselage damage, on 7 August 1962 at Vnukovo Airport after the nose undercarriage collapsed during servicing. Tail number СССР-76479 was one of only three long range D models manufactured.

<text>The Tupolev Tu-134 (NATO reporting name: Crusty) is a twin-engined, narrow-body jet airliner built in the Soviet Union for short and medium-haul routes from 1966 to 1989. The original version featured a glazed-nose design and, like certain other Russian airliners (including its sister model the Tu-154), it can operate from unpaved airfields.

One of the most widely used aircraft in former Comecon countries, the number in active service is decreasing because of operational safety concerns and noise restrictions. The model has seen long-term service with some 42 countries, with some European airlines having scheduled as many as 12 daily takeoffs and landings per plane. In addition to regular passenger service, it has also been used in various air force, army and navy support roles; for pilot and navigator training; and for aviation research and test projects. In recent years, a number of Tu-134s have been converted for use as VIP transports and business jets. A total of 854 Tu-134s were built of all versions (including test bed examples) with Aeroflot as the largest user by 1995, the Tu-134 had carried 360 million passengers for that airline.

== Design and development ==
Following the introduction of engines mounted on pylons on the rear fuselage by the French Sud Aviation Caravelle, airliner manufacturers around the world rushed to adopt the new layout. Its advantages included clean wing airflow without disruption by nacelles or pylons and decreased cabin noise. At the same time, placing heavy engines that far back created challenges with the location of the centre of gravity in relation to the centre of lift, which was at the wings. To make room for the engines, the tailplanes had to be relocated to the tail fin, which had to be stronger and therefore heavier, further compounding the tail-heavy arrangement.
During a 1960 visit to France, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev was so impressed by the quiet cabin of the Caravelle, that on 1 August 1960 the Tupolev OKB received an official directive to design a new aircraft with a similar engine arrangement. The requirement was also driven by the need to replace slow, aging piston-engined Il-14s on domestic routes. In 1961, the Soviet state airline, Aeroflot, updated its requirement specifications to include greater payload and passenger capacity, and since Aeroflot&#x27;s requirements dictated a larger aircraft than initially planned, the Soloviev Design Bureau developed the more powerful D-30 low-bypass turbofan engines.

The Tu-134 prototype, CCCP-45075, first flew on 29 July 1963, initially retaining the designation Tu-124A despite radical differences in design from the previous model (new engines, new wings, totally re-designed tail, etc). On 20 November 1963, the new airliner was officially designated Tu-134. Meanwhile in October 1963, the prototype British BAC One-Eleven, which had a similar T-tail layout, crashed with the loss of all crew while testing its stalling properties. The results of an exhaustive investigation by the British Accident Investigation Board prompted Tupolev to enlarge the tailplane on Tu-134s by 30% for greater control authority.

Design curiosities of the Tu-134 included a sharp wing sweepback of 35 degrees, compared to 25–28 degrees in its counterparts. The engines on early production Tu-134s lacked thrust reversers, which made the aircraft one of a handful of types from that era that used a brake parachute for landing in adverse conditions. The majority of onboard electronics operated on direct current. The lineage of early Soviet airliners could be traced directly to the Tupolev Tu-16 strategic bomber, and the Tu-134 carried over the glass nose for the navigator and the landing gear fitted with low-pressure tires to permit operation from unpaved airfields.

Serial production began in 1966 at the Kharkov Aviation Production Association, and production of the Tu-124 was discontinued. The Tu-134 was designed for short-haul lines with low passenger traffic. Originally the aircraft had 56 seats in a single class configuration, or 50 seats in a two-class configuration.

In 1968, Tupolev began work on an improved Tu-134 variant with a 76-seat capacity. The fuselage received a plug for greater passenger capacity and an auxiliary power unit in the tail. As a result, the maximum range was reduced from 3,100 kilometers to 2,770 kilometers. The upgraded D-30 engines now featured thrust reversers, replacing the parachute. The first Tu-134A, converted from a production Tu-134, flew on 22 April 1969. The first airline flight was on 9 November 1970. An upgraded version, the Tu-134B began production in 1980, with the navigator position abandoned, and seating capacity increased to 96 seats. Efforts subsequently began to develop a Tu-134D with increased engine thrust, but the project was cancelled.

== Operational history ==

In September 1967, the Tu-134 made its first scheduled flight from Moscow to Adler. The Tu-134 was the first Soviet airliner to receive international certification from the International Civil Aviation Organization, which permitted it to be used on international routes. Due to this certification, Aeroflot used most of its Tu-134s on international routes. In 1968, the first export customers, Interflug of East Germany, LOT Polish Airlines and Malév Hungarian Airlines purchased the Tu-134. In 1969, the Tu-134 was displayed at the Paris Air Show.

From 1972, Aeroflot began placing the Tu-134 in domestic service to Baku, Yerevan, Kyiv, Kishinev, Krasnodar, Leningrad, Omsk, Riga, and Sochi from Sheremetyevo International Airport in Moscow.

In its early years, the Tu-134 developed a reputation for reliability and efficiency, especially when compared with previous Soviet designs. After the establishment of tougher noise standards in the ICAO regulations in 2002, the Tu-134 was banned from most western European airports for its high noise levels. In early 2006, 245 Tu-134s were still in operation, 162 of which were in Russia. After a fatal accident in March 2007, and at the instigation of Russian Minister of Transportation Igor Levitin, Aeroflot announced that it would be retiring its fleet, and the last Tu-134 was removed from service on 1 January 2008. Some were still in operations with Aeroflot subsidiaries on local routes within Russia. The Tu-134 also found a new life as a business jet with many having an expensive business interior installed. High fuel and maintenance costs are increasingly limiting the number used today.

In June 2011, as a response to RusAir Flight 9605 which resulted in 47 fatalities, Russian president Dmitry Medvedev ordered preparations for taking the Tu-134 out of use by 2012.

On 22 May 2019, the final passenger flight of the Tu-134 in Russia took place.

Many Tu-134s have been preserved as memorials at airports throughout the former Soviet Union. A former Malév Tu-134A (registration HA-LBE) is on display at the Aeropark at Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport in Hungary.

<text>The Ilyushin Il-10 (Cyrillic Илью́шин Ил-10, NATO reporting name: &quot;Beast&quot;) is a Soviet ground attack aircraft developed at the end of World War II by the Ilyushin construction bureau. It was also license-built in Czechoslovakia by Avia as the Avia B-33.

==Development==
From the start of Eastern Front combat in World War II, the Soviet Air Force (VVS) used the successful ground attack aircraft Ilyushin Il-2 Sturmovik, powered by the Mikulin AM-38 inline engine. As the war progressed, the Soviets laid plans for that aircraft&#x27;s successor. The main goal was to increase speed and maneuverability at low altitudes, mainly to evade small-caliber anti-aircraft artillery, which was the main threat for ground attack aircraft, and to remove some of the Il-2&#x27;s faults. The most promising project was a modern, light and maneuverable close assault aircraft, the Sukhoi Su-6, developed by Pavel Sukhoi&#x27;s bureau from 1942. At the same time, Sergei Ilyushin developed a heavier aircraft, the BSh M-71, (Il-8 M-71), derived from the Il-2 design, on which it was partly based, to be powered by the prototype Tumansky M-71 radial engine, which did not enter production.

In 1943, Ilyushin started work on a new aircraft, Il-1, which was to be a 1- or 2-seat heavily armoured fighter-interceptor, meant mainly for fighting enemy bombers and transports. The Il-1 was similar to the Il-2 design, but was more modern, compact, and powered with a new Mikulin engine: the AM-42. But the VVS gave up the idea of heavy armoured fighters, due to their low speed, which was not enough to intercept modern bombers. As a result, Ilyushin decided to turn the Il-1 into a two-seat ground attack plane, with the designation changed to Il-10 in early 1944 (odd numbers were reserved for fighters).

At that time, Ilyushin also finished a prototype of a heavier ground attack plane, the Il-8, using the same engine, and more closely derived from the Il-2. It carried a higher payload (1,000 kg/2,204 lb), but had lower performance than the Il-10. Both types first flew in April 1944, the Il-10 proving greatly superior to the Il-8, which had poor handling. The Il-10 successfully passed trials in early June 1944.

The third competitor was a new variant of the Sukhoi Su-6, also powered by the AM-42 engine. After comparative tests, the Il-10 was considered the winner and was chosen as the new ground attack plane, despite some opinions that the Su-6 was a better aircraft, notwithstanding inferior performance and payload, with better gun armament. Notably, the Su-6 prototype was tested with maximum payload, causing lowered performance, while the Il-10 was tested with normal payload. Some advantages of the Il-10 came from its technical similarity to the Il-2.

===Production===
On 23 August 1944 the Il-10 was ordered into serial production by decision of the State Defense Committee (GKO) as a new ground attack plane. Its armament was initially similar to late model Il-2s, with two 23 mm VYa-23 cannons and two ShKAS machine guns in the wings, and a 12.7 mm UBT machine gun for a rear gunner, and 400 kg, or a maximum 600 kg of bombs. Unlike the Il-2 and Su-6, it was not initially meant to carry rockets.

Production of the Il-10 started in Kuybyshev&#x27;s factories No. 1 and No. 18. The first production aircraft flew on 27 September 1944 and 99 aircraft were produced by the end of 1944. Early series aircraft showed teething problems, most notably engine faults and fires. Most problems were eliminated by 1945. Aircraft produced from April 1945 onwards could carry four unguided air-to-ground rockets. Aircraft produced from 1947 onwards were fitted with stronger armament, consisting of four 23 mm NS-23 cannons in the wings and a 20 mm cannon for the rear gunner. Il-10 production ended in 1949, after a run of 4,600 aircraft; in the last two years, they were produced in factory No. 64.

Between 1945 and 1947, 280 UIl-2 or Il-10U trainer variants were produced. The rear gunner&#x27; cockpit was replaced with a longer instructor&#x27;s cockpit with dual controls. Its performance and construction were similar to the combat variant apart from armament, which was reduced to two cannons, two rockets, and a standard load of bombs.

In 1951, the Czechoslovak firm Avia secured a license to make Il-10s, with the designation B-33. The first one flew on 26 December 1951. Initially, their engines were Soviet-built. From 1952 onwards the engines were also produced in Czechoslovakia as the M-42. Besides the combat variant, a Czechoslovak trainer variant also entered service under the designation CB-33. In total, 1,200 B-33s were built by 1956.

In 1951, due to experience acquired during the Korean War, the Soviet Air Force decided that propeller ground attack aircraft might still be useful, and decided to renew Il-10 production in a modified variant, the Il-10M, which first flew on 2 July 1951. It was slightly longer, with a wider wingspan, and larger control surfaces, with a fin under the tail. Four of the more recently developed NR-23 cannons were mounted in the wings, while the payload stayed the same, and newer navigation equipment was installed, giving partial all-weather capability. Speed decreased slightly, but handling improved. Between 1953 and 1954, 146 Il-10Ms were made, all but 10 in Rostov-on-Don&#x27;s factory No.168.

In total, 6,166 of all Il-10 variants were made, including those built under license.

Trials of Il-10s mounted with more powerful AM-43 and AM-45 engines took place, but proved unsuccessful. Ilyushin next designed a lighter close support aircraft, the Il-16, with improved performance and similar armament. It first flew on 10 June 1945. A short run entered production, but the project was cancelled in 1946 due to the AM-43 engine&#x27;s unreliability.

==Design==

===Technical description===
The airframe was a one engine two-seat monoplane, with a metal-covered frame. It was highly armoured. The front part of the fuselage, with the cockpit, was a shell of armour plates 4–8 mm thick; the thickest, 8 mm, were under the engine, there was no armour above the engine. The front windshield was made of armour glass 64 mm (2.5 in) thick. Also armoured were: the roof above the pilot, side window frames in the pilot&#x27;s cab, the wall between crew seats, and the rear wall behind the cab. Total armour weight was 994 kg, including its attachment. The wing consisted of a central section, with two bomb bays, and two detachable outer panels. The undercarriage was retractable. The main wheels folded to the rear after rotating by 86°.

Early Il-10s had two 23 mm VYa-23 autocannons (150 rounds each) and two 7.62 mm ShKAS machine guns (750 rounds each) fixed in the wings, and a 12.7 mm UBT machine gun in a rear gunner station BU-8, with 150 rounds. The horizontal angle of the rear machine gun field of fire was 100°. From 1947, the aircraft were armed with four NS-23 23 mm cannons in the wings (150 rounds each) and 20 mm B-20T cannon in a rear gunner station BU-9 (150 rounds). The IL-10M had four 23 mm NR-23 cannons in wings (150 rounds each) and 20 mm B-20EN cannon in a rear gunner station BU-9M (150 rounds). Avia B-33 had four 23 mm NS-23RM cannons in wings and 20 mm B-20ET cannon in a rear gunner station BU-9M.

The normal bomb load was 400 kg, maximum load was 600 kg. This could be small fragmentation or anti-tank bomblets, put in bomb bays, or four 50–100 kg bombs in bomb bays and externally under wings, or two 200–250 kg bombs attached under wings. Small bomblets were put directly on bomb bay floors, in piles. A typical load was 182 (maximum 200) 2 kg AO-2,5-2 fragmentation bombs, or 144 PTAB-2,5-1,5 anti-tank HEAT bombs. Apart from bombs, four unguided rockets RS-82 or RS-132 could be carried on rail launchers under wings. Avia B-33s were also fitted to carry other rocket types. Late Soviet aircraft could carry ORO-82 and ORO-132 tube launchers. In the tail section was a DAG-10 launcher with 10 anti-aircraft or anti-personnel grenades AG-2 (after being thrown, they would fall with parachutes and then burst, but were not widely used in practice).

The Il-10 engine was a 12-cylinder inline V engine Mikulin AM-42, liquid-cooled, power: 1,770 hp continuous, takeoff power: 2,000 hp. Three-blade propeller AV-5L-24 of 3.6 m diameter. Two fuel tanks in the fuselage: upper 440 L over engine, ahead of the cockpit, and lower tank of 290 L under the cockpit. The aircraft had a radio set and a camera AFA-1M in a rear section of the fuselage.

==Operational history==
In October 1944, the Il-10 first entered service with training units in the Soviet Air Force. In January 1945, the first Il-10 combat unit entered service with the 78th Guards Assault Aviation Regiment, but it did not enter action due to unfinished training. However, three other Il-10 units managed to take part in the final combat actions of World War II in Europe. They were the 571st Assault Aviation Regiment (from 15 April 1945), the 108th Guards Assault Aviation Regiment (from 16 April 1945), and the 118th Guards Assault Aviation Regiment (on 8 May 1945). About a dozen aircraft were destroyed by flak or engine breakdowns, but the Il-10 appeared to be a successful design. One was shot down by an Fw 190 fighter, but a crew of the 118th Regiment shot down another Fw 190 and probably damaged another. On 10 May 1945, the day after the official Soviet end of the war, (Victory Day), there were 120 serviceable Il-10s in Soviet Air Force combat units, and 26 disabled ones.

After the USSR entered the war against the Empire of Japan, with the invasion of Manchuria, from 9 August 1945, one Il-10 unit, the 26th Assault Aviation Regiment of the Pacific Navy Aviation, was used in combat in the Korean Peninsula, attacking Japanese ships in Rasin and rail transports.

After the war, until the early 1950s, the Il-10 was a basic Soviet ground attack aircraft. It was withdrawn from frontline service in 1956. At the same time, work on new jet-powered dedicated armoured ground attack planes (like the Il-40) was canceled, and the Soviets turned to multipurpose fighter-bomber aviation. The Il-10 and its licensed variant, the Avia B-33, became a basic ground attack plane of the Warsaw Pact countries. From 1949 to 1959, the Polish Air Force used 120 Il-10s (including 24 UIl-10) and 281 B-33s. In Poland, the B-33 was modified to carry 400 L fuel tanks under its wings. From 1950 to 1960, Czechoslovakia used 86 Il-10s, including six UIl-10s, and about 600 B-33s. From 1949 to 1956, the Hungarian Air Force used 159 Il-10s and B-33s. From 1950 to 1960, the Romanian Air Force used 14 Il-10s and 156 B-33s. Bulgaria also used these aircraft.

In the late 1940s, 93 Il-10 and UIl-10s were given to North Korea. They were then used in the 57th Assault Aviation Regiment during the early phase of the Korean War. They were initially used with success against the weak anti-aircraft defense of South Korean forces (following the US refusal to supply the south with &quot;heavy weapons&quot;), but then they suffered heavy losses in encounters against the United States Air Force fighters and were bombed on the ground themselves. After several weeks, about 20 remained. In the summer of 1950, North Korea received more aircraft from the USSR. The North Koreans claimed that they sank a warship on 22 August 1950 with Il-10s, but it was never confirmed.

From 1950, Il-10s were used by the People&#x27;s Republic of China, in two regiments of an assault aviation division. They were used in combat during a conflict with the Nationalist government on Taiwan, over border islands in January 1955. They remained in service until 1972 (replaced by the Nanchang Q-5). From 1957, Yemen used 24 B-33s.

=== Kemlitz incident ===
On 14 April 1951 a flight of Soviet Il-10 aircraft of the 16th Air Army departed Reinsdorf for the bombing and strafing range at Lieberoser Heide. Thirteen aircraft crashed across a wide area in the vicinity of Kemlitz for the loss of 26 aircrew. The cause of the disaster – whether sabotage, a fueling error, or something else – remains publicly unknown. The aircrew are buried at the Soviet Cemetery Potsdam. In April 2011 a memorial stone was erected in the village square at Kemlitz.

<text>The 1st Golden Raspberry Awards were held on March 31, 1981, at founder John J. B. Wilson&#x27;s living room alcove to recognize the worst the film industry had to offer in 1980. For it was a double feature of &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop the Music&quot;, winner of Worst Picture, and &quot;Xanadu&quot; that inspired Wilson to start the Razzies. Each category included as many as ten nominees; the maximum was lowered to five the following year to mirror the Oscars. &quot;There was a fake stage in John&#x27;s apartment,&quot; remembers Maureen Murphy, who was a presenter.

==Winners and nominees==



==Films with multiple wins and nominations==
The following films received multiple nominations:

The following films received multiple awards:

==Criticism==
The awards are often criticized for nominating &quot;The Shining&quot; for two categories: Shelley Duvall for Worst Actress and Stanley Kubrick for Worst Director. In 2022, Razzies founder John J. B. Wilson admitted that he regrets the nomination, saying: &quot;Knowing the backstory and the way that Stanley Kubrick kind of pulverized her, I would take that back.&quot; That same year, the awards committee rescinded Duvall&#x27;s nomination, but not Kubrick&#x27;s. The nominations for Brian De Palma&#x27;s &quot;Dressed to Kill&quot; have also been criticized.

<text>The Ilyushin Il-62 (; NATO reporting name: Classic) is a Soviet long-range narrow-body jetliner conceived in 1960 by Ilyushin. As a successor to the popular turboprop Il-18 and with capacity for almost 200 passengers and crew, the Il-62 was the world&#x27;s largest jet airliner when first flown in 1963. The seventh quad-engined, long-range jet airliner to fly (the predecessors being the De Havilland Comet (1949), Avro Jetliner (1949), Boeing 707 (1954), Douglas DC-8 (1958), Vickers VC10 (1962), and experimental Tupolev Tu-110 (1957)), it was the first such type to be operated by the Soviet Union and a number of allied nations.

The Il-62 entered Aeroflot civilian service on 15 September 1967 with an inaugural passenger flight from Moscow to Montreal and remained the standard long-range airliner for the Soviet Union (and later, Russia) for several decades. It was the first Soviet pressurised aircraft with non-circular cross-section fuselage and ergonomic passenger doors and the first Soviet jet with six-abreast seating (the turboprop Tu-114 shared this arrangement) and international-standard position lights.

Over 30 nations operated the Il-62 with over 80 examples exported and others having been leased by Soviet-sphere and several Western airlines. The Il-62M variant became the longest-serving model in its airliner class (average age of examples in service as of 2016 is over 32 years). Special VIP (salon) and other conversions were also developed and used as head-of-state transport by some 14 countries. However, because it is expensive to operate compared to newer generation airliners, the number in service was greatly reduced after the 2008 Great Recession. The Il-62&#x27;s successors include the wide-bodied Il-86 and Il-96, both of which were made in much smaller numbers and neither of which was widely exported.

==Development==

The Ilyushin OKB presented a proposal for a four-engined long-range jet airliner in February 1960, receiving the go-ahead from the Soviet Council of Ministers on 18 June 1960, with the Kuznetsov Design Bureau being instructed at the same time to develop the NK-8 turbofan to power the new airliner. The official specification required that the airliner, designated Il-62, must carry 165 economy-class passengers over a distance of 4,500 km (2,800 mi) or 100 first-class passengers over 6,700 km (4,200 mi).

The Il-62 replaced the fast turboprop Tu-114 on long-range routes. As the Tu-114 was just entering service when the Il-62 was on the drawing board, Ilyushin had time for an unhurried design, test, and development programme. This was useful, since the Il-62 did call for significant development.

The Il-62 and the British Vickers VC10 are the only commercial airliners with four engines fitted in twinned/paired nacelles by the sides of, and beneath, a T-shaped empennage (T-tail). In the case of Ilyushin, the configuration was dictated by TsAGI, the Soviet Union&#x27;s aerospace agency, since Ilyushin&#x27;s design bureau lacked the resources to engage in configuration studies. This layout allowed the wing design to be optimised for aerodynamic efficiency, without being cluttered by having to carry engines. In addition, the rear-mounted engines reduced engine noise in the cabin and allowed smaller vertical tail surfaces (as the yawing moment in the event of an engine failure was reduced compared to wing-mounted engines). These advantages are balanced by a number of drawbacks. The wing structure, lacking the weight of forward engines to pull down against the wing torsional moment, needed to be heavier, as did the rear fuselage structure, which had to carry the engines. In addition, aerodynamic wash (shadow) from the wing blankets the tail when the nose is pitched up (high angle of attack) leading the aircraft into a condition known as deep stall. This called for complex and (in the 1960s) unreliable automatic stall warning systems such as stick shakers and stick pushers to prevent the aircraft from stalling, although the Il-62&#x27;s wing was designed to prevent deep stall.

Early aircraft (prototypes, pre-production and initial production aircraft) display an evolution from thin or thick kinked leading inboard edges to the ultimate thick and straight 1966 shape. The characteristic &quot;dog-tooth&quot; also moved until fixed before production began. The engine installation also evolved, with the engines&#x27; longitudinal axes canted by 3 degrees from the horizontal, addition of thrust reversers to the outer engines, and slimming down of the entire installation as production began.

The prototype was grossly underpowered, as its intended NK-8 engines were not ready, and small Lyulka AL-7 turbojet engines had to be installed temporarily. The prototype with AL-7PB engines (registered СССР-06156) first flew on 3 January 1963, but crashed after clipping a perimeter fence during a maximum-weight testing flight of the development program. The production Il-62 was powered by the originally intended rear-mounted Kuznetsov NK-8-4 engines. The first Il-62 powered with NK-8 engines (registered СССР-06153) first flew in 1964.

The Il-62M variant (first flight in 1971, introduced in 1973) has more powerful, more efficient, and quieter Soloviev D-30KU engines and a fin fuel tank. Beneath the skin, the Il-62M has simpler and lighter single-slotted flaps and incremental aerodynamic improvements. Most important of these was the addition of spoilerons (spoilers or wing-mounted lift-disruptors which can act in the same capacity as ailerons by differential deployment in cruising flight), or in concert to kill lift on landing, and the ability to use idle reverse thrust in flight during the final approach so as to shorten the landing run. All but one example in service today are Il-62M. In 1978, the Il-62MK was further developed to seat up to 198 passengers and carry about 2 tonnes (4,400 lb) more payload or fuel than the Il-62M.

Other versions were also planned, including a stretched version to seat up to 250 passengers and a shrunk version to suit smaller airfields.

The Il-62 has tricycle landing gear with an additional lightweight gear strut at the rear of the fuselage which extends when the aircraft reaches its parking position. Aircraft with rear-mounted engines are usually tail-heavy when sitting empty on the ground, and to prevent the aircraft from tipping up on its tail, various devices are used for supporting the tail from simple &quot;pogo stick&quot; fixed struts on small aircraft to light-weight extendable struts (Il-62). Aircraft like DC-9 or Boeing 727 use an airstair door under their tail, which serves the dual purpose of a tail support and an extra door for passenger loading.

The Il-62 is the only airliner in its class with unpowered, all-manual flight controls, using steel cables, rods, pulleys, aerodynamic and weight balances, and aerodynamic trim tabs. The Il-62 also has a forward-mounted tank serving as a water ballast. This may be used when the aircraft flies empty or lightly loaded. If this is a fact, it would rank the Il-62 alongside other airliners that use ballast, notably the French Caravelle and the Soviet Tu-154. Due to the rear-mounted powerplants, the wings are aerodynamically clean, and takeoff and landing aids are employed without the disturbing effect of engine nacelles, resulting in free airflow over the dorsal wing surface. This allows the aircraft to fly through air turbulence of 16–18 m/s without affecting its stability.

Another key Il-62 trademark is the &quot;saw tooth&quot; (&quot;dog-tooth&quot;) on the wing leading edge. This prominent feature acts as an aerodynamic fence vortex generator (without which the wings would be almost vortex-free), and fixed leading-edge droop/slat/flap. It ensures vice-free behaviour at high angles of attack and assists efficient long-range cruise. The saw tooth removes the need for hydraulic controls, stick shakers, and stick pushers. Later models of the VC10 (for British United Airways and Ghana Airways) also adopted this feature, in their case closer to the wing tips.

Early NK-8-4-engined Il-62s suffered from performance problems, including fatigue and overheating issues with the engines, sometimes leading to false fire alarms, which could possibly cause the crew to accidentally shut down paired engines to prevent contiguous engine and fuselage damage. Flying with only two paired engines on the same side would, however, render the aircraft unbalanced and difficult to control. Subsequent modifications to the Il-62 and the VC10 (which had a similar engine arrangement) largely rectified this problem. There were two fatal Il-62 losses involving engine failure, both occurring with aircraft owned by LOT Polish Airlines, which had also leased a number of Il-62s from Aeroflot and Tarom. The higher-fatality accident (183) was a fully laden Il-62M Flight 5055 on 9 May 1987, which experienced a rear fuselage fire that possibly went unnoticed by the crew, hence their decision not to land at one of two nearby airports. Control of the plane was eventually lost on the return flight to Warsaw, most likely due to one of the auxiliary fuel tanks fitted to some LOT Il-62s having ignited. The other was an unmodified (early version) NK-8-4-powered Il-62 Flight 007, which crashed on 14 March 1980 with 87 fatalities after being fitted with an engine that had previously caused vibration problems when used on two other LOT aircraft (the investigation suggested that the turbine disc was damaged before its final installation).

Powerplant failure of the type that afflicted the LOT aircraft was extremely rare because bearing wear is generally identified by vibration tests during maintenance. At the time, however, LOT did not have equipment to test or fault-diagnose engines of the size used in the Il-62. Unfortunately this meant that any potential problem might not be identified between overhauls. There were other known instances of engine failure, but these did not result in loss of control. The LOT accidents involving different engine types (but same engine position) was a fatal crash-rate 30 times higher than the Il-62 average (2.8% vs 0.092%). At least one other LOT Soloviev D-30-equipped aircraft (Tu-154) also suffered a similar engine failure (non-fatal) around this time. After 1987, LOT introduced turbine vibration-detecting equipment and shortened the time between inspections. It also adopted the dual flight control system used on some other Il-62s and deleted the auxiliary engine-pod fuel tanks. These planes were subsequently sold to Air Ukraine in 1991/1992, which operated them until the airline closed in 2000. In 2010, 30 years after the loss of Flight 007, an investigation of previously unreleased archives at Instytut Pamięci Narodowej revealed that during the industrial unrest of the 1980s LOT had been instructed by the Polska Rzeczpospolita Ludowa authorities to effect operational cost savings by over-exploitation of service life of its jet engines (see ).

===Special Il-62 conversions===

Several special conversions were made to the basic Il-62, the main ones being the Il-62 and Il-62M salon VIP versions used by heads of state, and the Il-62M airborne command aircraft (just one example) used by the Russian government. Although the Il-62 had been introduced during Khrushchev&#x27;s time, it was during the Brezhnev era that Ilyushin was asked to develop the salon versions, which have been used by Russian leaders ever since right up to the Putin years (during which time both Il-62 and Il-96 aircraft were used in combination). The VIP examples were fitted with conference rooms and rest areas, rooms for the retinue, and service personnel and bodyguards, while the secure communication equipment enabled contact with Moscow and other cities from any part of the globe. Examples were also delivered to other countries, including Czechoslovakia, Germany, North Korea, Sudan and Ukraine.

An airborne command Il-62M (RA-86570) was customised for the emergency-response agency EMERCOM to provide evacuation transport for Russian citizens from foreign countries and act as airborne command post for these and other emergency situations. It operates in conjunction with at least one other Il-62M and a fleet of Il-76, Il-76TD waterbombers, An-72 and helicopters, which have operated in some 60 countries, and is credited with having saved 50,000 lives since the agency was created in 1994. Apart from basic interior changes, RA-86570 features hush-kitted engines and Honeywell electronics with global communication ability via satellite, and an Inmarsat system. The aircraft was used as a command post during the combat of forest fires in the Far East, when dealing with the Chechen terrorist attack in Kaspiysk when an apartment building was blown up, and to bring a Russian Deputy Foreign Minister to Sharjah in 1996 and from there, collecting the crew of an Il-76 freighter who had escaped from the Taliban militia in Afghanistan.

==Design==


The Il-62 is a conventional all-metal low-wing monoplane of riveted sectional semi-monocoque construction to fail-safe design principles (a structure designed so that failure of one major member does not cause immediate failure of the whole). Its service life was initially set at 30,000 flight hours and subject to extensions and curtailments according to the quality of service procedures, inspection and manufacturer&#x27;s bulletins. The aircraft features pressurised cabin and freight holds (with fuselage dimensions of 3.8 m width x 4.1 m height), duplex all-mechanical flight controls, though with twin electric motors for tailplane incidence control; hydraulic nosewheel steering, landing gear and tail strut actuation, and wheel brakes. The Il-62M has spoilers and lift dumpers which extend automatically upon landing and are hydraulically operated. Control surfaces include a variable-incidence tailplane with dynamically and weight-compensated elevators with trim tabs, triple-section tabbed ailerons (outermost for low speed and innermost for high speed) which are interlinked with a torsion bar, spoilerons (Il-62M), spoilers and lift dumpers, and pneumatically actuated thrust reversers on the two outboard engines (the reversers are flight-rated on the Il-62M).

27 V AC electrics are used throughout with a TA-6 auxiliary power unit (a turbine generator which supplies electric power and air conditioning on the ground) in the lower tailcone plus backup lead-zinc batteries.

The aircraft uses conventional hot air de-icing using engine bleed air. Its sea level is equivalent to 2,400 m (8,000 ft) above mean sea level and thereafter reducing to the equivalent of 2,400 m (8,000 ft) to cruise altitude. It was originally built with no automatic oxygen masks; emergency supply comprises hatrack-housed oxygen bottles and masks for manual distribution to passengers by cabin crew. Since 1997, most aircraft have been retrofitted with automatic oxygen supply systems with drop-down masks.

Its avionics include a Polyot-1 automatic flight control system (a &quot;super autopilot,&quot; able to be programmed with a set route which it can fly without human intervention but under constant flight crew monitoring; ICAO Cat. 1 approaches standard, Cat. 2 optional), Doppler navigational radar replaced by triplex INSS (Inertial Navigation System Sets) on Il-62M after 1978 and by Satellite navigation sets on many aircraft after 1991, triple VHF and HF flightdeck radios, automatic direction finders, Soviet and Western instrument landing system receivers, vertical omnidirectional radio range and radio beacon receivers, duplex radio altimeters, automatic radio transponders, a full ICAO-standard navigation lights fit, cabin tannoy and intercom systems. Soviet/Russian and Warsaw Pact sovereign examples are additionally fitted with triplex &quot;Odd Rods&quot; (NATO code name) IFF (identification friend or foe) air defence transponders identifiable by three closely spaced short aerials.

Emergency evacuation systems include inflatable life rafts and manually extendable canvas evacuation slides. Most aircraft are now retrospectively fitted with emergency floor lighting strips and some aircraft equipped with automatically inflatable evacuation slides. Fire extinguishers are sited in engine nacelles, flightdeck compartment, cabin crew rest areas and toilets.
The Il-62 offers accommodation for up to 198 passengers in a single-class layout, seated six-abreast at 84 cm (33 in) seat pitch in two cabins separated by a vestibule, galley/pantry and cabin crew rest area. There are three toilets, forward, midships, and aft. It has a buffet/bar and a further cabin crew rest area in a vestibule forward, with a further optional cabin crew rest area aft. Typical mixed-class accommodation ranges between 128 and 144, seated four or six abreast, and a common single aisle configuration for long distance Aeroflot examples was first class (2-abreast) 3 rows, business class (3-abreast) 4 rows, economy class (3-abreast) 17 rows (Thiel, 2001). In this configuration, the central aisle in business and economy classes is quite narrow. A first class compartment is optionally sited aft of forward entry door or just forward of midships entry door, with an economy compartment further forward in the latter case. &quot;Skycot&quot; fitments are located in hatracks, while later Il-62Ms (1978 onwards) feature enclosed hatracks. Customer-optionable interior fitments. No in-flight entertainment systems are available except a public-address system that may be coupled to an open-reel or audio cassette player. Individual aircraft were experimentally fitted with television sets for Soviet-standard videotape entertainment during the 1970s. Some aircraft were retrospectively fitted with Western in-flight entertainment (solely audio) systems after 1991.

===Similarities to VC10===
A sideline to the Il-62 story concerns alleged industrial espionage. As the Il-62 was developed at about the same time as the VC10, to which it bears a marked external resemblance, British Cold War commentators implied that the VC10 design may have been copied by dubbing the Il-62 the &quot;VC10-ski.&quot;, but no evidence of this was ever presented. There are significant differences between the Il-62 and the VC10, as the Soviet type is larger, lifts a greater load, and is designed for use exclusively at developed airports whereas the British type can adapt to &quot;up-country&quot; bases. Unlike the VC10, the Il-62 uses conservative technology, such as mechanical control surface linkages, and is an entirely civilian machine, whereas the VC10 was designed to serve as both a civilian airliner and military airlifter and freighter. The Il-62 found more buyers and was built in much larger numbers than the VC10 (292 vs 54), and as of November 2018 many examples are still in service. On the other hand, the VC10 has been retired from that role (in 1966 BOAC described the aircraft as uneconomic and asked for government subsidies to continue operating it, although some VC10s were used by Britain&#x27;s Royal Air Force in support roles). China and Czechoslovakia were two countries that cancelled orders for the VC10 (for CAAC and Czechoslovak Airlines, respectively) and purchased the Il-62 instead. 

==Operational history==


After the introduction of the Il-62M, Aeroflot (the largest operator of the plane) gradually upgraded and later replaced its fleet of NK-8 powered Il-62s with the newer Soloviev D-30 KU-powered Il-62M. Coupled with engine nacelle and other modifications, greatly reduced the chance of contiguous powerplant damage. By mid-1973, the airline was operating 60 Il-62s, and by 1989 this had increased to 165 (Il-62 and Il-62M). The Il-62M had a dispatch rate with Aeroflot of 97% with some examples logging as many as 17 flight hrs/day, and it was described as the most reliable type in the fleet at that time. It set several international records in its class, mostly exemplifying a range capability far in excess of the conservative Aeroflot calculations applied in Soviet times. Some of these records were set by an all-woman crew of five captained by Iraida (&quot;Inna&quot;) Vertiprahova. With 10 tonnes of freight, the Il-62M had a maximum range of 10,300 km compared to 9,412 km for the VC10 carrying the same weight. With a 23 tonne payload, the Il-62M range was 8000 km, compared to 6,920 km for a Boeing 707 with maximum payload. Because of its capacity, the plane has historically been used for emergency civilian evacuation flights, one of the most notable being the landing of an Aeroflot-registered Il-62 at Santiago Airport, Chile on the night of 10 September 1973 (the day before the military coup by Augusto Pinochet) in order to evacuate 147 Cuban embassy personnel. In April 2015 two EMERCOM Il-62Ms (including RA-86495 of the Russian Federation Air Force) were used to evacuate around 900 foreign nationals and Yemenis from Sanaa during the Saudi-led military operation against Yemen.

The Il-62 was said to be well regarded by pilots and passengers alike, especially for its strong directional stability in high turbulence (although landings are sometimes bouncy), smooth cruising ability and very quiet interior in cruise mode due partly to engine placement. Although the original Il-62 was rated for a service life of 23 years and was criticised for heavy fuel consumption, upgraded M versions are sometimes rated for 50 years and have greatly improved operational economics. One of the drawbacks of the original Il-62 design was the lack of a cargo bay roller transfer system, which necessitated manual loading of pre-packaged baggage and cargo thus making preparation of the aircraft rather slow (a cargo/baggage conveyance system is standard on the Il-62M). There is relatively easy access to all serviceable mechanical components including the engines whilst the plane&#x27;s thrust reversal capabilities allows reverse taxiing without the need for tow vehicles. Powerplant overhaul intervals varied between specifications and maintenance procedures and between the thrust reverse-capable outer engines and the inner ones. Czech Airlines operated an early Il-62 on a proving basis up to 3000 hrs between overhauls, which was well beyond the recommended (and their usual) intervals which were nearer 2000 hrs although Interflug were able to designate up to 5000 hrs with their service facilities. Subsequent upgrades to some Il-62Ms provided for 6000 hr overhaul intervals (with total engine life of 18,000–20,000 hrs). Later examples of the Il-62M remain in regular commercial service (as of 2016), and the type also sees continued use as a VIP/head of state transport.

Although the plane&#x27;s safety record does not equal that of later airliners, there were no fatal accidents involving an Il-62 between 1989 and 2009 during which time the highest number of planes were in service. Several Il-62/M accidents over the first decades of operation mainly involved runway overruns or aborted takeoffs. The braking system employed the reverse thrust of the outer engines only, and if for some reason one or other failed to engage, the aircraft could become difficult to steer for an unprepared pilot. In seven takeoff or landing accidents there were no fatalities, a testament to the high level of structural integrity, and in two cases with landing-related fatalities [CCCP-86470 and UP-16208] these were due to the aircraft colliding with structures near the runway [tower and concrete wall, respectively]. The Il-62/M fuselage features a strengthened hull with &#x27;ski&#x27; keel originally designed to allow for an undercarriage-up emergency landing (in practice the undercarriage and landing gear proved extremely reliable). The trade-off for the reinforced airframe is the relatively high fuel consumption and some airlines such as Interflug modified their planes to reduce fuel consumption.

Production is said to have continued until 1995, although continuous production ended in 1993. Including prototypes, total production is surmised as being 289. However, the factory states 292 (5 prototypes, 94 Il-62s and 193 Il-62Ms).

Four aircraft remained unsold at the factory as of 1997, while the last delivery was reportedly RA-86586 of Magma, built in 1995, but only delivered in 1999 as a result of tariffs imposed on imported western aircraft. The last airframe was built in 2004 for the Sudanese government.

During the Syrian Civil War, Russian Aerospace Forces Il-62M were observed flying between Russia and Syria. Starting at the end of 2015, with the Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War, Russian Aerospace Forces Il-62M were frequently reported departing and landing at the Khmeimim Air Base in Latakia, Syria, moving materiel and personnel in and out of Syria.

==Operators==
===Civil operators===
At least one Ilyushin Il-62 aircraft is in service with North Korea&#x27;s Air Koryo as of November 11th, 2024.

===Operational history===
Over 30 countries have operated the Il-62 since 1967, although exports did not begin until initial Aeroflot needs had been met (rapid replacement of Tu-114s on international services). First exports were in late 1969 to CSA Czechoslovak Airlines. The pattern was similar with the Il-62M, of which the first export (to Cubana) was delayed until 1977. Among Eastern Bloc nations, Bulgaria and Hungary did not operate the Il-62 series, although Hungary briefly leased one example pending Boeing 767 services in 1990. As a curiosity, Malév Hungarian Airlines was the first and only foreign airline to order the Il-62 according to the October 1967 issue of &quot;Flight International&quot;. In 1968 the new political trend called &quot;New Economic Mechanism&quot; introduced by the Hungarian Council of Ministers led to the deletion of the order, because of financing problems. This was due, among other more important reasons, to heavy anti-Ilyushin lobbying by Tupolev in the former country and to commercial considerations in both countries whose airlines preferred to concentrate on short and medium range routes, that was equal to the low demand for the long-haul service.

East Germany, Poland, USSR, Czechoslovakia and Cuba were among the largest foreign customers for the Il-62. The former East German airline Interflug owned 24 aircraft: 21 in civilian service and three for airforce and presidential use (later transferred to the united German airforce), including six Il-62s, 16 Il-62Ms and two rare Il-62MKs (after unification, seven Interflug Il-62s were on-sold to Uzbekistan which later also bought the three airforce examples). Czech Airlines (formerly Czechoslovak Airlines) operated 21 planes between 1969 and 1997, including 15 Il-62s and six Il-62Ms, of which 15 were registered under the famous CSA &#x27;OK jet&#x27; designation, and six were leased from Aeroflot. Some of these planes were still operational in 2012. Cuba operated 27 different Il-62s, of which 12 were leased either from Aeroflot or Tarom (which operated three Il-62s and two Il-62Ms alongside its Boeing 707s) and 15 were owned by Cubana which became a long-term operator with its first Il-62M purchase in 1977. After 2000, Cubana refurbished its remaining planes for international routes, on which they operated until March 2011. LOT Polish Airlines operated 23 Il-62s and Il-62Ms, including aircraft leased from Aeroflot and Tarom. The largest non-state operator of the Il-62 was Russian-based Domodedovo Airlines which acquired 45 planes from Aeroflot (42 Il-62Ms and 3 Il-62s) that were used for domestic services including continuous operations on the world&#x27;s longest internal route, Moscow to Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, a distance of .

From 1970, Air France and Japan Air Lines wet-leased a number of Aeroflot Il-62s for long-haul services, and from 1971, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines operated nine Aeroflot-registered Il-62s for the Moscow-Amsterdam route (these planes wore joint Aeroflot/KLM markings).

Due to strained relations between the Soviet Union and the US during the 1980s, in 1984 Aeroflot coordinated with Irish carrier Aer Lingus to use Shannon airport as a hub for connecting flights from Moscow and Leningrad to link with the Irish carrier&#x27;s New York routes. Aeroflot was also granted rights to use Shannon for flights to Cuba and South America (Peru). From 1992 Irish tour operators contracted Aeroflot to carry tourists to the eastern US (Miami) and later to the Caribbean, Central America and Mexico, using Il-62Ms. On any given day, Shannon hosted up to eight Il-62s and Il-86s (in addition to Tu-154s and Tu-134s). By 1995/1996, Shannon was handling 2,400 Aeroflot transit flights carrying 250,000 passengers per annum (including government-registered Il-62Ms) with Aeroflot crews being housed near Shannon airport. By 1995, direct flights between Moscow and the US became possible and the use of Shannon as a hub declined. For its US west-coast air links (which began in 1991) Aeroflot Il-62s flew east to Anchorage from Moscow and several cities in the Russian Far East (Khabarovsk, Vladivostok, Magadan, and Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk), often continuing on to San Francisco. Trans-Pacific Il-62 flights between the Russian Far East and Anchorage continued until 2000.

Il-62M/MKs remained popular for civilian service in Russia up until the economic recession of 2008. In late 2008, Russian-operated planes were removed from scheduled passenger operations due to a severe economic crisis affecting major operators Interavia Airlines, Dalavia and Domodedovo Airlines. As a result, Rossiya became the largest operator, but it uses the Il-62 for government service only. By September 2009 a total of 38 Il-62s (all versions) remained in service worldwide (compared with 88 planes in service in 2006), only one of which was the original series aircraft operating with Russian Air Force while others were M or MK-series aircraft. In 2011 Cubana retired its last civilian examples 33 years after receiving its first Il-62. Some other airlines and governments also operate small numbers of the type. In 2013 DETA Air ceased operations of Il-62M.

===Government/military operators===
The aircraft has seen military use with the air force of East Germany (DDR [GDR]) and later the united Germany (one Il-62MK and two Il-62Ms) and is believed to have been operated by the air forces of other countries including Cuba, Gambia, Georgia, Libya, North Korea, Russia, Romania and Ukraine. It is used as an emergency response aircraft by the Russian government (RA-86570 and RA-86495). In addition to military use, it has been used as a personnel or head-of-state transport by Russia (at least eight examples), Ukraine, East Germany, Georgia (2748552), Uzbekistan (UK-86569), Gambia (C5-RTG), Mozambique, Sudan (ST-PRA), Cuba, North Korea, and Czechoslovakia, the government of which used an Il-62 (OK-BYV) and three Il-62Ms between 1974 and 1996. Some head-of-state examples were produced in VIP interior configuration whilst others were standard civilian versions.

In North Korea, two Il-62Ms (operated by Air Koryo) are owned by the North Korean government. Both have government liveries and VIP interior configurations and are given the call sign &quot;Chammae&quot; (national bird of North Korea). One is coded as &quot;Chammae-1&quot; which transports Kim Jong Un while the other, Chammae-2, provides transport to high level government officials and VIPs. Chammae-2 was seen transporting officials of the high-level DPRK delegation including Kim Yong Nam and Kim Yo Jong to Incheon International Airport in Seoul, South Korea for the 2018 Winter Olympics. Both aircraft are part of Air Koryo&#x27;s inventory of four Il-62Ms.

==Incidents and accidents==
Since its first flight in 1963 there have been 12 fatal accidents during civilian service, namely: nine crashes, two landing overruns and an aborted takeoff (fatalities of the last three resulted from collisions with structures near the runway). The complete list of incidents include eight of Il-62M (a total of 25 incidents/accidents in ASN database, 14 of which were Il-62M, including 24 April 1998 and 20 April 2008).

As of July 2012 there had been 23 hull losses from all causes including prototype testing, fires, runway overruns, navigational errors, and non-operational incidents, 48% of which did not involve fatalities, with 1,141 fatalities total. This figure and the list below includes planes that were still operable but were deemed uneconomic to return to service due to their age and/or flight hours (YR-IRD and CU-T1283).

Within the group of comparable airliners (Il-62/Il-62M, VC10/Super VC10, Boeing 707, DC8) the Il-62M had the lowest hull loss rate.

==Aircraft on display==
As the first long-range jet airliner to be put into service by a number of nations, some retired Il-62s have been converted into museums and other uses in countries such as the Czech Republic, Germany, Austria, Cuba and China. 

The best known example is the Il-62 &quot;DDR-SEG&quot; from the former East German airline Interflug. On 23 October 1989, DDR-SEG was intentionally landed on the short grass Stolln/Rhinow airfield by Interflug&#x27;s chief Il-62 pilot in a famous but potentially dangerous manoeuvre. Fire trucks and ambulance crews were positioned on hand for the landing but were not needed. The jet is used to commemorate the site of the fatal crash of Otto Lilienthal (1848–1896) at the Gollenberg hill. Nicknamed &quot;Lady Agnes&quot; after Lilienthal&#x27;s wife, it is now a museum with the fuselage divided between the Lilienthal collection and a wedding registry. 

Previously, in July 1983, another landing of an Il-62 on unimproved ground took place at Monino, Russia, when Ilyushin OKB Chief Test Pilot delivered CCCP-86670 to the Monino outdoor Air Force Museum.

A derelict Il-62 without any paint or markings is on display near Vasylkiv Air Base in Ukraine.

<doc id="229857" wikidata="Q1934496" url="?curid=229857" title="The Marble Index">
<text>The Marble Index is the second studio album by the German musician Nico, released in November 1968 on Elektra Records. The avant-garde sound introduced in the album—a stark contrast with her folk pop debut, &quot;Chelsea Girl&quot; (1967)—was the result of the combination of Nico&#x27;s droning harmonium and somber vocals, and the producer John Cale&#x27;s musical arrangements, which were inspired by modern European classical music. Nico envisioned the release as an attempt to get artistic legitimacy and changing the looks that had made her famous as a fashion model.

Although &quot;The Marble Index&quot; was largely unnoticed when it was released, it has achieved acclaim over time. Nico&#x27;s unprecedented sound and personal style—both recognised for their tenebrous quality—are considered an influence on several artists. Most notably, they served as a musical and visual prototype for the 1980&#x27;s gothic rock scene. Nico and Cale continued working together, releasing two more studio albums in the same vein—&quot;Desertshore&quot; (1970) and &quot;The End...&quot; (1974)—which are now considered parts of a trilogy.

== Background ==
Nico had made her recording debut in 1965 with the single &quot;I&#x27;m Not Sayin&#x27;&quot;. At Andy Warhol&#x27;s suggestion, she joined the Velvet Underground as a chanteuse, and sang three tracks on their 1967 album &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot;. Nico and the group were regulars at the Factory. However, Lou Reed was reluctant to include her in the band. This, coupled with her desire to be a soloist, made Nico leave the group as casually as she had joined. The band members continued to accompany her as she performed on her own and played on her 1967 solo debut, &quot;Chelsea Girl&quot;. The folk-pop album included songs by Bob Dylan, Tim Hardin, and Jackson Browne (with whom Nico had a brief affair).

The American singer Jim Morrison, whom Nico later called her &quot;soul brother&quot;, encouraged her to write her own songs; this was &quot;a key breakthrough&quot; for her. They were together in California in July and August 1967, often driving into the desert and experimenting with peyote. Morrison, who encouraged Nico to write down her dreams, read the writings of Mary Shelley, William Blake and Samuel Taylor Coleridge to her. He recorded his chemical visions and dreams, using the material for his songs as he imagined the opium-addicted Coleridge had worked. In 1986 Nico said, &quot;He taught me to write songs. I never thought that I could ... He really inspired me a lot. It was like looking in a mirror then.&quot; She began writing material and performing it to an intimate audience at Steve Paul&#x27;s club, the Scene. Nico composed her music on a harmonium bought, according to Richard Witts, from a San Francisco hippie. Her manager, Danny Fields, said that she may have acquired it through the Canadian singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen. The harmonium became her trademark with which &quot;she discovered not only her own artistic voice but a whole new realm of sound&quot;.

&quot;The Marble Index&quot; was produced during a little-studied period of Nico&#x27;s life. For &quot;The Quietus&quot;″s Matthew Lindsay, &quot;the liminal drift of these years only emphasizes the music&#x27;s amorphous moorings and lack of precedent.&quot; Nico approached Danny Fields in mid-1968 with the desire to make an album and prove herself artistically. Resentful of her beauty, she radically changed her image – dyeing her hair red and wearing black clothes in an effort to distance herself from what had made her a popular fashion model. Cale said, &quot;She hated the idea of being blonde and beautiful, and in some ways she hated being a woman, because she figured all her beauty had brought her was grief ... So &quot;The Marble Index&quot; was an opportunity for her to prove she was a serious artist, not just this kind of blonde bombshell.&quot;

Nico already had the title for the album in mind from &quot;The Prelude&quot;, William Wordsworth&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot;. In the poem Wordsworth contemplates a statue of Isaac Newton in the chapel of Trinity College, Cambridge: &quot;with his prism and silent face / The marble index of a mind for ever / Voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone.&quot; Asked about the significance of this Wordsworth quote, Nico replied, &quot;I sometimes find a little of my own poetry in other poets, yes. Incidentally, or accidentally.&quot;

==Recording==

Fields relayed Nico&#x27;s request to Jac Holzman, head of Elektra Records; she then went to Holzman&#x27;s Broadway office with her harmonium and performed for him. Despite the challenging nature of Nico&#x27;s music, Holzman agreed to release her album and assigned Frazier Mohawk to produce it, despite Nico and John Cale&#x27;s desire to work together. He gave her a budget of $10,000 (), with a four-day recording schedule at a studio on La Cienega Boulevard in Los Angeles. Fields contacted Cale, who was the album&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; producer after Mohawk gave him free rein. According to Mohawk, he spent most of the sessions using heroin with Nico. Her drug use is cited as influencing the album&#x27;s sound; Simon Reynolds wrote, &quot;While it may be a reductive interpretation to regard &quot;The Marble Index&quot; as the ultimate heroin album, its hunger for narcosis, its frigid expanses, recalls William Burroughs&#x27;s description of the junkie&#x27;s quest for a metabolic &#x27;Absolute Zero&#x27;.&quot;

During the sessions, Nico and Cale &quot;fought at every opportunity&quot;; Nico was &quot;in pain&quot; while recording. Nico and Cale worked on one song at a time, mixing the album as they went, with her voice and harmonium the starting points for each track. Cale said about the recording process:
The harmonium was out of tune with everything. It wasn&#x27;t even in tune with itself. She insisted on playing it on everything so we had to figure out ways to separate her voice from it as much as possible and then find instrumental voices that would be compatible with the harmonium track ... As an arranger you&#x27;re usually trying to take the songs and put a structure on them, but what I thought was valuable was when you took the centre out of the track and worked around the central core of the tonality and changes. That left you with a sort of floating free-form tapestry behind what she was doing, which is when things became more abstract.
&lt;/blockquote &gt;

He also said, &quot;I was pretty much left alone for two days, and I let [Nico] in at the end. I played her [the album] song by song, and she&#x27;d burst into tears. &#x27;Oh! It&#x27;s so beautiful!&#x27;, &#x27;Oh, it&#x27;s so beautiful!&#x27; You know, this is the same stuff that people tell me, &#x27;Oh! It&#x27;s so suicidal!&#x27;&quot; The original release of &quot;The Marble Index&quot; included eight of 12 songs Nico recorded. &quot;Roses in the Snow&quot;, &quot;Nibelungen&quot;, &quot;Sagen die Gelehrten&quot; and &quot;Reve Reveiller&quot; were left off the album. The finished album was barely 30 minutes long, which &quot;was as much apparently as Frazier Mohawk, mixing and sequencing it, could stand without starting to feel suicidal&quot;.

==Composition==

&quot;The Marble Index&quot; avant-garde style distanced Nico from rock and pop. When an interviewer pointed out the contrast with &quot;Chelsea Girl&quot;, Nico said that and &quot;The Marble Index&quot; was &quot;&quot;not&quot; supposed to be noise, because most pop music to me is noise, alright?&quot; According to Cale, the album &quot;makes more sense in terms of advancing the modern European classical tradition than it does as folk or rock music&quot;. With Nico&#x27;s compositions based around one or two chords, Cale decided to avoid drone and &quot;raga&quot; (Eastern music common on the West Coast at the time) in favor of a European classical approach in his arrangements. The music has been compared with Germanic folk music, Gregorian chant, medieval music such as madrigals, European avant-garde, Romanticism, and the music of Richard Wagner.

Peter Buckley noted Nico&#x27;s use of psychedelic drugs during the Summer of Love as an influence on the album&#x27;s music, and Jim DeRogatis described it as &quot;minimalist bad-trip psychedelia&quot;. &quot;Frieze&quot; called &quot;The Marble Index&quot; the &quot;bridge between the New York Minimalists of the late 1960s and Brian Eno&#x27;s ambient records of the late 1970s&quot;. The critic Simon Reynolds identified the album as &quot;the rock precedent for isolationism&quot;, a term coined by the critic Kevin Martin to describe &quot;a loose network of disenchanted refugees from rock and experimental musicians&quot; that originated the genre known as dark ambient. Isolationism, Reynolds writes, &quot;breaks with all of ambient&#x27;s feel-good premises&quot; and &quot;evokes an uneasy silence: the uncanny calm before catastrophe, the deathly quiet of aftermath&quot;. He listed Aphex Twin (particularly his 1994 album &quot;Selected Ambient Works Volume II&quot;), Seefeel, David Toop and Max Eastley, among others, as exponents of this style.

According to &quot;Uncut&quot;, &quot;The Marble Index&quot; is &quot;one of that rare breed of recordings which, the better part of four decades later, still has no adequate comparison, existing in a genre all its own&quot;. The album is considered a -goth record. André Escarameia felt the album &quot;anticipated gothic rock by more than a decade due to [its] ethereally darker [ambience] and disturbing sonority.&quot; Its soundscape has been described as &quot;bleak&quot;, &quot;chilly&quot;, &quot;harrowing&quot;, and &quot;everything from the sound of someone rapping on a coffin lid to that of being buried alive&quot;. In her 1969 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review, Anne Marie Micklo described it as &quot;mood music, with an obscure and elusive text recited over it&quot;. Regarding the record&#x27;s sonority, British author Simon Goddard wrote, &quot;it was on [&quot;The Marble Index&quot;] that the real sound of Nico was unleashed: a bleak pumping misery which would define her music for the last two decades of her life.&quot; Lenny Kaye of &quot;Wondering Sound&quot; described the album as &quot;Circe-like&quot;.

===Songs===

Nico&#x27;s lyrics have been described as &quot;mythological and surrealist&quot;. According to &quot;Spin&quot;, &quot;for lyrical inspiration, Nico looked to the Romantic poets and peyote, passions shared with Jim Morrison.&quot; Stephen Davis wrote that the album&#x27;s lyrics stem from the collaboration between Nico and Morrison, and his influence can be seen in song titles such as &quot;Lawn of Dawns&quot;, &quot;Frozen Warnings&quot; and &quot;Evening of Light&quot;. Morrison offered Nico a model for her writings by showing her how he worked on his poems, indicated by her use of internal rhymes. According to Peter Hogan, some of her lyrics &quot;show a marked debt to Sylvia Plath and to William Blake&quot; and a search for artistic legitimacy. Other critics have found Nico&#x27;s lyrics to be intriguing. For example, Richie Unterberger wrote: &quot;Nico intones lyrics that don&#x27;t quite express specific feelings but convey a state of uneasy restlessness.&quot; They have also been described as &quot;stark [and] symbolist&quot; and &quot;metaphysical&quot;.
The album begins with a gentle piano-and-glockenspiel instrumental before segueing into &quot;Lawn of Dawns&quot;, which introduces Nico&#x27;s harmonium &quot;of undulating motion weaving against her voice&quot;. The song is engulfed in &quot;weird clattering and tintinnabulating&quot;, while a &quot;dark twangy guitar ... stumbles to a subdued halt in [its] final seconds&quot;. It features what may be Nico&#x27;s first lyrics, inspired by her peyote visions with Jim Morrison: &quot;He blesses you, he blesses me/The day the night caresses,/Caresses you, caresses me,/Can you follow me?/I cannot understand the way I feel/Until I rest on lawns of dawns—/Can you follow me?&quot; Nico explained the peyote-induced experience which inspired the lyrics: &quot;The light of the dawn was a very deep green and I believed I was upside down and the sky was the desert which had become a garden and then the ocean. I do not swim and I was frightened when it was water and more resolved when it was land. I felt embraced by the sky-garden.&quot; The lyrics of the next song, &quot;No One Is There&quot;, have been described as &quot;in all probability influenced by Jim Morrison&quot; (&quot;Some are calling/Some are sad/Some are calling mad&quot;) and are sung over Cale&#x27;s classical quartet of violas darting in and out of her unusual vocal tempo. &quot;Ari&#x27;s Song&quot; was dedicated to Nico&#x27;s young son, Christian Aaron &quot;Ari&quot; Boulogne, her only child with French actor Alain Delon, and has been called &quot;the least-comforting lullaby ever recorded&quot;. It begins with the harmonium&#x27;s clipped, whistling tones as she sings softly, &quot;Sail away/Sail away my little boy&quot;. &quot;Facing the Wind&quot; is supported by &quot;Cale-banged piano clusters, scraping of percussion or walls and off-beat tympani&quot;; Nico&#x27;s voice sounds filtered (possibly through a Leslie speaker), with the &quot;somnambulistic toiling&quot; of her pipe organ accompanied by viola and strident piano.

Side two opens with &quot;Julius Caesar (Memento Hodié)&quot;, which lyrically explores myths and gods. It features Nico&#x27;s low, droning harmonium accompanied by Cale&#x27;s viola. On &quot;Frozen Warnings&quot;, Cale&#x27;s arrangement harmonically blends with the pipe organ. It is considered Nico&#x27;s signature song from her collaboration with Cale; Nina Antonia wrote: &quot;Of all the strange and wracked numbers on the record, &#x27;Frozen Warnings&#x27; is quintessential Nico; lyrics that convey a sorrowful atmosphere and little comfort in the melody.&quot; The album&#x27;s dreamlike quality end with its last song, &quot;Evening of Light&quot;, which has been described as &quot;frighteningly quiet and hypnotizing&quot;. Nico sings &quot;Midnight winds are landing at the end of time&quot;, with harpsichord and Cale&#x27;s staccato viola building until the latter gains ground and sways with the tympani&#x27;s &quot;roar and clatter&quot;. The 1991 reissue of &quot;The Marble Index&quot; also includes the outtakes &quot;Roses in the Snow&quot; and &quot;Nibelungen&quot;. In the latter, Nico&#x27;s vocals are unaccompanied. The full version (with instrumental accompaniment) was included in the 2007 compilation &quot;The Frozen Borderline – 1968–1970&quot;; according to Dave Thompson of AllMusic, &quot;It rises to equal any of Nico&#x27;s subsequent performances or compositions.&quot;

==Release and aftermath==
Holzman said &quot;there was no question&quot; of not releasing &quot;The Marble Index&quot; despite its lack of commercial appeal. He saw it as a work of art, rather than a product. It was released in November 1968 with little promotion. A music video for &quot;Evening of Light&quot;, featuring Iggy Pop and the other Stooges, was shot by the art collector François de Menil in 1969. He described the clip as &quot;a sort of pre-MTV promotional item for [&quot;The Marble Index&quot;]. An early pop promo.&quot; De Menil was interested in shooting a short film with Nico, and she agreed with the condition that they would film it in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Pop&#x27;s hometown, and that he would be featured in it. Dave Thompson described the clip as follows: &quot;It was shot in a cornfield behind [Pop&#x27;s house], barren and stubbly in the late winter chill, Nico in white and windswept, Pop in whiteface, manic and agitated, caressing and crushing the mannequin parts that littered the field, while a wooden cross is raised before them and set ablaze as night falls.&quot; Elektra Records—who had not agreed to finance the project—rejected the music video, as did &quot;any other media outlets that de Menil approached&quot;.

&quot;The Marble Index&quot; &quot;failed to challenge the supremacy of &quot;Nashville Skyline&quot;, &quot;From Elvis in Memphis&quot;, &quot;Abbey Road&quot; and &quot;Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes Join the Temptations&quot; on the album charts of 1969&quot;. Although Holzman was pleased with the album, Nico&#x27;s longevity with the label was unlikely; he was increasingly concerned with her heroin use and she had a difficult, irresponsible attitude. Nico left the United States before she was officially released from Elektra, after a violent incident in a New York City bar. Biographers refer to her leaving the U.S. as an exile; Nico said, &quot;When you live in a dangerous place, you also become increasingly dangerous. You might just wind up in jail.&quot;

In London, Nico recorded two more albums with Cale in the same vein: &quot;Desertshore&quot; (1970) and &quot;The End...&quot; (1974), now considered parts of a trilogy. The album was reissued as a CD in 1991 with two bonus tracks. Songs from &quot;The Marble Index&quot; have been included in Nico compilations including &quot;The Classic Years&quot; (1998), &quot;Femme Fatale&quot; (2002), and &quot;The Frozen Borderline – 1968–1970&quot; (2007). For Elektra&#x27;s 60th anniversary, &quot;Frozen Warnings&quot; was released as a single on October 25, 2010, with &quot;No One Is There&quot; as its B-side.

==Critical reception ==
Although &quot;The Marble Index&quot; was generally unnoticed when it was released, it was praised by the countercultural &quot;East Village Other&quot; and &quot;International Times&quot;; however, most critics found &quot;her desolate soundscapes inaccessible.&quot; Anne Marie Micklo of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album a positive review, calling side two &quot;a really worthwhile venture into musical infinity&quot;. A cult following emerged around it, which included music journalist Lester Bangs, who wrote in a 1978 article entitled &quot;Your Shadow Is Scared of You: An Attempt Not to Be Frightened by Nico&quot;: &quot;&quot;The Marble Index&quot; is the greatest piece of &#x27;avant-garde classical&#x27;, &#x27;serious&#x27; music of the last half of the 20th century so far.&quot; Although Bangs praised the album, he also wrote that it &quot;scared the shit out of [him]&quot; and described the listening experience as &quot;self-torture&quot;.

The album&#x27;s rise to acclaim was slow; for the most part, audiences have remained nonplussed. According to Simon Goddard, most critics regard it as &quot;[Nico&#x27;s] defining avant-garde masterpiece&quot;. &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; considers &quot;The Marble Index&quot; the point in Nico&#x27;s discography where &quot;the difficult listening starts&quot;, and the album is &quot;pretty amazing for it&quot;. Anthony Carew of About.com called it &quot;a suite of rootless songs written with little precedent&quot; and &quot;an astonishing haunting, the work of a woman who, even whilst alive, seemed a lot like a ghost&quot;. Anthony Thornton of &quot;NME&quot; called it an &quot;artistic triumph&quot;: &quot;Bleak but beautiful, this album remains the most fitting embodiment of her doomed glamour.&quot; According to &quot;Spin&quot;, &quot;Few records, before or since, have sounded lonelier, spookier, or more desolate&quot;. &quot;Trouser Press&quot; described it as &quot;one of the scariest records ever made&quot;.

AllMusic&#x27;s Richie Unterberger awarded the album three stars out of five, describing Nico&#x27;s songwriting as &quot;singularly morose&quot;. Dorian Lynskey wrote for &quot;The Guardian&quot; that &quot;The Marble Index&quot; forces the distinction between art and entertainment, comparing it to the &quot;terrifying&quot; output of musician Scott Walker (particularly the album &quot;Tilt&quot;), painter Mark Rothko and writer Philip Roth. Simon Reynolds described the record as &quot;psychic landscapes, glittering in their immaculate, lifeless majesty of someone cut off from the thawing warmth of human contact and fellowship&quot; and &quot;religious music for nihilists&quot;. Sputnikmusic&#x27;s Louis Arp was less enthusiastic, finding the music &quot;pretentious&quot; and &quot;agitating&quot; in the aura it evoked while deeming Nico&#x27;s lyrics repetitive and meaningless. &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau said, &quot;While &quot;The Velvet Underground and Nico&quot; plus &quot;Chelsea Girl&quot; convinced me that Nico had charisma; &quot;The Marble Index&quot; plus &quot;Desertshore&quot; convince me that she&#x27;s a fool.&quot;

== Legacy ==

&quot;The Marble Index&quot; has a sound which distinguishes it from the musical landscape of the 1960s. Anthony Thornton of &quot;NME&quot; called it &quot;a stark, oppressive opus that has influenced everyone from PJ Harvey to the Duke Spirit. According to &quot;Spin&quot;, &quot;[&quot;The Marble Index&quot;] set the tone for decades of music to come – Arthur Russell, Dead Can Dance, Fennesz, Zola Jesus, Grouper, pretty much every metal band that ever used a harpsichord – but few followers have sailed so near to the edge of the abyss with such chillingly beautiful results.&quot; The Canadian rock band The Marble Index is named after Nico&#x27;s album.

Simon Reynolds wrote about a female rocker he called the Ice Queen: &quot;Ice is the opposite of all that women are supposed to be: warm, flowing, giving, receptive. Like Lady Macbeth, the Ice Queen has unsexed herself, dammed up her lachrymal and lactation ducts. She offers cold, not comfort. Her hard surfaces can&#x27;t be penetrated. She is an island, an iceberg.&quot; In &quot;The Marble Index&quot; Nico took this persona (originally embodied by Grace Slick) even further, making a fetish of disconnection and &quot;[dreaming] of a sort of negative nirvana&quot;. According to &quot;Dazed&quot;, this persona has influenced Siouxsie Sioux, Zola Jesus, and Björk. The lattermost&#x27;s 2011 album, &quot;Biophilia&quot;, was described by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as &quot;The Marble Index&quot;″s &quot;haunted digital sister&quot;. The influence of &quot;The Marble Index&quot; can also be found in the music of Laurel Halo.

&quot;Frozen Warnings&quot; was included in Toby Creswell&#x27;s compendium &quot;1001 Songs&quot;; Creswell wrote, &quot;Just as she had done with &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot;, the singer put a new tone into music.&quot; In 2013 John Cale curated &quot;Life Along the Borderline: A Tribute to Nico&quot; at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, which featured songs from &quot;The Marble Index&quot; and other Nico albums performed by Peaches, Yeasayer, Sharon Van Etten, Meshell Ndegeocello and Cale. Primal Scream&#x27;s Bobby Gillespie has listed &quot;The Marble Index&quot; as one of his favorite albums and stated that it was a &quot;huge influence&quot; in the making of their 1991 album &quot;Screamadelica&quot;. Jamie Stewart of Xiu Xiu, has cited the album as an inspiration, writing, &quot;it completely changed my entire view of what it was possible to do in music&quot;, and &quot;you could never mistake it for anything else, which is an astounding thing to be able to do.&quot; The album was also a favorite of American musician Elliott Smith.

&quot;The Marble Index&quot;, which influenced the gothic rock of the late 1970s and early 1980s, has been called &quot;the first goth album&quot;. Ian Astbury of the Cult and Peter Murphy of Bauhaus have cited Nico as an influence. She lived in the United Kingdom when the gothic rock scene was developing, with supporting acts including the Sisters of Mercy and Gene Loves Jezebel. According to Murphy, &quot;Nico was gothic, but she was Mary Shelley gothic to everyone else&#x27;s Hammer horror-film gothic. They both did &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, but Nico&#x27;s was real.&quot; David Dalton of &quot;Gadfly Online&quot; disagreed: &quot;Some say she is the originator of Goth, but this is just silly, a misunderstanding, a pastiche. Nico has no heirs. She is a discrete entity.&quot;

The album&#x27;s release coincided with a change in Nico&#x27;s look, when she adopted what has been called a &quot;gothic horror princess&quot; persona and &quot;switched from dyed blonde to dark henna and started wearing black, heavy fabrics and boots&quot;. As a result, in addition to being a musical prototype for the goth subculture, Nico became a visual one as well. Claire Marie Healy wrote, &quot;Nico&#x27;s visual statement of these years speaks of the power that comes with creating a new persona for yourself&quot; and she described the singer as &quot;the first ever goth girl&quot;. By the early 1980s, many women began to dress like Nico; nicknamed &quot;Nico-teens&quot;, they were the first goth girls, encouraging a cult following for the singer. Pennyblack contributor Eoghan Lyng praised the process: &quot;It&#x27;s not the destination that&#x27;s high on her mind, but the process; explosive, earnest, and laced with a lustre for adventure.&quot;

<text>The Ilyushin Il-86 (; NATO reporting name: Camber) is a short- to medium-range wide-body jet airliner that served as the USSR&#x27;s first wide-bodied aircraft. Designed and tested by the Ilyushin design bureau in the 1970s, it was certified by the Soviet aircraft industry, manufactured and marketed by the USSR.

Developed during the rule of Leonid Brezhnev, the Il-86 was marked by the economic and technological stagnation of the era: it used engines more typical of the late 1960s, spent a decade in development, and failed to enter service in time for the Moscow Olympics, as was originally intended. The type was used by Aeroflot and successor post-Soviet airlines; only three of the total 106 constructed were exported. 

At the beginning of 2012, only four Il-86s remained in service, all with the Russian Air Force. By the end of 2020 the number in active service was reduced to three.

==Development==

===Background===
In the mid-1960s, the United States and Western Europe planned airliners seating twice the then-maximum of some 200 passengers. They were known as &quot;airbuses&quot; at the time. The Soviet leadership wanted to match them with an &quot;aerobus&quot; (). Alongside the propaganda motive, the USSR genuinely needed an &quot;aerobus&quot;. Aeroflot expected over 100 million passengers a year within a decade (the 100th million annual passenger was indeed carried on 29 December 1976.)

First to respond was OKB-153, the bureau led by Oleg Antonov. It proposed a 724-seat version of the An-22 airlifter. The project was promoted until 1969, ultimately with a 605-passenger interior (383 on the upper deck and 223 on the lower). It did not go ahead due to fears that it would be old-fashioned and because the Kiev-based bureau was close to the deposed Nikita Khrushchev.

===Concept===
Many airports had terminals too small for &quot;aerobuses&quot;. In the West, the solution to this involved constructing greater airport capacity. By contrast, Soviet aviation research institutes addressed ways of increasing passenger throughput without the need for additional airport capacity.

Many Soviet airports also had surfaces too weak for &quot;aerobuses&quot;. The Soviet solution again favoured adapting aircraft to existing conditions, rather than reconstructing airports. The &quot;aerobus&quot; thus had to match the ground loadings of existing airliners. This called for complex multi-wheel landing gear.
The Soviet solution to the airport capacity issue involved passengers loading and unloading their own luggage into and from the aircraft. This was eventually called &quot;the luggage at hand system&quot; (; transliterated: &quot;sistyema bagazh s soboy&quot;). Soviet aviation journalist Kim Bakshmi described it (at its ultimate) thus: &quot;One arrives five minutes prior to departure, buys oneself a ticket on board the aircraft, hangs one&#x27;s coat next to the seat and places one&#x27;s bag or suitcase nearby.&quot;

Taking suitcases into the cabin, as in trains, was studied, but necessitated a 3 m fuselage extension with a 350-seat capacity. To avoid this, passengers were to deposit their luggage in underfloor compartments as they entered the airliner.

Ideas similar to the &quot;luggage at hand system&quot; were briefly addressed in the West. Airbus studied such an arrangement in the mid-1970s. Lockheed implemented it into the L-1011 TriStar in 1973 at the request of Pacific Southwest Airlines (who used the baggage compartment as an entertainment lounge) and possibly also to suit potential Soviet buyers (see below).
In October 1967, the Soviet government approved a Ministry of Civil Aviation (Aeroflot) specification for an &quot;aerobus&quot;. This called for 350 seats and a range of with a 40-tonne payload or with seats taken but no freight. The airliner had to operate from smaller airports (classified as &quot;Klass &quot;B&quot;&quot; and &quot;V&quot; [Russian: класс &quot;Б&quot;, &quot;В&quot;] or &quot;Class B/C&quot; by the Soviets) runways.

In the second half of the 1960s, OKB-240 (as the Ilyushin bureau was formally known) was restoring positions lost (with Yakovlev, in favour of Tupolev and Antonov) during the Khrushchev era and was well placed to secure design of the &quot;aerobus&quot;. When the Soviet cabinet&#x27;s defence industry committee promoted the Aeroflot specification on September 8, 1969, to a preliminary project, (Russian: аванпроект; transliterated: &quot;avanproyekt&quot;), it entrusted it to Ilyushin. The bureau received specific operational requirements for the &quot;aerobus&quot; on February 22, 1970.

In developing the concept which had been agreed, Ilyushin faced four challenges: configuration (layout or &quot;shape&quot;), powerplant, automation (avionics) and manufacturing capacity.

===Conceptual development===
Ilyushin began work on the &quot;aerobus&quot; in late 1969, initially by assessing the development potential of existing aircraft. An enlarged Il-62 (the Il-62-250) would have had a 30-tonne payload, 259 seats and a 6.8 metre/22 ft longer fuselage: a virtual analogue of the Douglas DC-8 &quot;Super Sixty&quot; series. Other proposed Il-62 modifications involved double-deck and &quot;two fuselages side-by-side&quot; developments. There was also a project to &quot;civilianise&quot; the Il-76.

From March 1970 the bureau developed all-new designs under the Il-86 designation. Instead of the &quot;appropriate technology&quot; approach of the Il-62, these designs were to have powered controls, complex high-lift devices and advanced automation which would reduce the number of flightdeck crew.

An early &quot;avanproyekt&quot; was shown to the Soviet leadership at an exhibition of civil aviation innovations at Vnukovo-2 Airport near Moscow on May 17, 1971. A scale model with the designation of &quot;Il-86&quot; showed the &quot;self-loading&quot; concept with integral boarding stairs, below-deck luggage stores, and below-deck midships galley. It had a twin-aisle interior with nine-abreast seating in a &quot;3–3–3&quot; layout. Ilyushin considered it politic to make the interior wider than any planned airliner except the Boeing 747. The 6.07 m (19.9 ft) fuselage diameter was partly dictated by the need to provide standing room in the underfloor luggage compartments. The Il-86 had the second-widest fuselage of any airliner until the Boeing 777.

On this basis, on 9 March 1972, the bureau was asked to proceed with detailed design. The difference between the 1971 model and the eventual Il-86 was in configuration: the model had looked like an Il-62. At that time, the Central Aero and Hydrodynamics Institute (TsAGI) favoured the clean-winged, rear-engined, T-tailed configuration for airliners. The BAC Three-Eleven and BAC/CASA/MBB &quot;Europlane&quot; projects had similar configurations.
The configuration of heavy jet aircraft was a politically sensitive issue in the USSR. Aircraft designer Leonid Selyakov states this of the underwing-engine US-pioneered layout which gradually became standard for jet airliners: &quot;The configuration of the В-47, taken on strength by the US Air Force ... brought forth a veritable storm of critical opinions from [Soviet] aviation scientists. Responsible TsAGI officials and industry leaders robustly called that aircraft &#x27;utter nonsense&#x27; (similar opinions were expressed of the Boeing 747).&quot;

Similar controversies were known in Western aeronautical circles but this Soviet approach showed a typical streak of dogmatism which held that problems had immutable, &quot;scientifically correct&quot; solutions. However, not all Soviet aviation engineers were so fixed in their ideas, and the configuration issue figured prominently in a remarkable meeting held discreetly in Paris in the late 1960s between Boeing engineers (notably Joe Sutter, chief project engineer for the 747, and Bob Withington, a senior engineer who was deeply involved in the SST program) and some of their Soviet counterparts. This meeting had been approved at the highest levels of both governments because each side had something the other wanted very badly: the Soviets wanted to know exactly why Boeing had put the 747 engines in under-wing pods instead of at the rear of the fuselage, while Withington and the Boeing engineers had a long list of questions about the processing and use of titanium in airframes (at the time Boeing badly needed this for their proposed Boeing 2707 SST, at Mach 3 too fast and hot for Concorde-style aluminium, and the Soviets then led the world in titanium technology). According to Sutter&#x27;s account, both sides left the meeting well satisfied with the exchange of information.

It seems (again according to Sutter&#x27;s account of the aftermath) that this meeting may have made a real difference to Soviet aircraft design, but Boeing&#x27;s contribution could naturally not be acknowledged publicly by the Soviet side. Ilyushin therefore had to stress that it had been the first in the world to use podded engines suspended from pylons beneath and ahead of the wing, on the experimental Ilyushin Il-22 four-engined jet bomber of 1946 (first use of this designation). Having thus presented the Il-86&#x27;s ultimate configuration as indigenously Soviet, the bureau could at last show it in public in 1973, six years after publication of the &quot;aerobus&quot; specification and four years after the design assignment. A modern six-window flightdeck followed, in place of the 18-to-20 window glazing of the Il-18, Il-62 and Il-76.
The main problem facing the Il-86 project was the lack of a suitable engine. It was never resolved. By the close of the 1960s, the US and the UK had turbofans with bypass ratios of 4 or 5 to 1. The first Soviet large turbofan, the Lotarev D-18T, did not appear before the mid-1980s. The Soloviev D-30, originally intended for the Il-86, was the most advanced Soviet civil aeroengine. It had a bypass ratio of 2.4 to 1 and aerodynamic clamshell thrust reversers. It failed to attain the required thrust, however: &quot;only after the lapse of three years that were spent on preparing the advanced development project did it become clear that these engines would not provide the necessary take-off performance.&quot; The less-advanced Kuznetsov NK-8 series engine, adopted on March 26, 1975, had a bypass ratio of 1.15 to 1 and drag-inducing grilles over its cascade thrust reversers. Both these engines had high specific fuel consumptions and were noisy. Being ultimate developments of smaller engines, they could not offer growth to future Il-86s.
The appropriate/intermediate technology principles to which most Soviet airliners before the Il-86 had been designed meant that they had typically five-member flight crews. The design and entry into service in 1972 of the Tu-154, an airliner built to high technology principles (more automation, less human input), showed that Soviet science lagged behind in the development of avionics which would remove the need for navigators and radio operators. A programme of avionics development was mounted to enable the Il-86 to operate in most weather with a three-member flight crew, matching Western technology of the time.
The shortage of manufacturing facilities for the Il-86 was a problem from the outset: &quot;The rapid modernisation of the Soviet Air Force ... has left limited scope for the expansion of commercial production ... the lack of production capacity is being remedied partly by ... international cooperation.&quot; This meant involving the Polish aircraft industry in the project.

===Interest in foreign technology===
The Soviets tried to import technology to solve the issues with the powerplant, avionics and manufacturing capacity. The attempts took two directions. First was wholesale technology transfer similar to the Li-2 deal of the 1930s. This would have delayed Il-86 development, since the programme would have been demoted to a reserve status. The second direction was to import individual systems and items. This would have speeded Il-86 development. The fact that Il-86 development was protracted indicates that for long periods the programme was pursued as backup insurance in case wholesale technology transfer failed.
Before the Boeing 747 had flown, a Ministry of Civil Aviation delegation visited the United States for a series of detailed sales presentations on the type lasting three days. At the 1971 Paris Salon, Ilyushin bureau head Genrikh Novozhilov and Boeing&#x27;s Joe Sutter are claimed to have arranged an informal technology trade-off. Over supper in a Paris restaurant, the Soviet side ceded information on titanium technology to the Americans, while the latter, &quot;sketching on the tablecloth,&quot; ceded information on pylon-mounted podded engines and &quot;the structural and aerodynamic amity of the aeroelastic wing.&quot; Soviet interest in buying the 747s continued until the end of détente in the late 1970s.

At the peak of &quot;détente&quot;, on March 11, 1974, a Lockheed L-1011 TriStar arrived in Moscow for three days of sales presentations and demonstrations. The TriStar matched the Il-86 in size and performance and had development potential. Negotiations to buy 30 TriStars of the L-1011-385-250 version and licence-produce up to 100 a year in a new factory employing 80,000 people continued until mid-1976. Any residual will to export TriStars was scotched when administration of US President Jimmy Carter made human rights a key pillar of US foreign policy. TriStar exports would have needed Coordinating Committee clearance: the type embodied advanced technology banned from potential enemies. In 1978, the US Department of Commerce vetoed export of 12 General Electric CF6-50 engines ordered by the USSR for planned long-range Il-86s.
By analogy with other aircraft programmes, a third direction in the efforts to acquire foreign technology may have involved illicit action along the lines of the reverse engineering of the Tu-4 from the B-29 and the copying of the Rolls-Royce Nene jet engine as the Klimov VK-1. Oblique reference to this comes in an account of the An-124 by the then-powerplant head of the Antonov bureau, V. G. Anisyenko: &quot;The MAP leadership wanted to have a uniform large engine also capable of civil aviation applications, such as the Il-86. The most suitable analogue from this viewpoint was considered to be the Rolls-Royce RB.211-22. To purchase it, in 1976 a MAP procurement party went to Great Britain, headed by engine construction deputy minister Dondukov ... Our ultimate task was to copy the RB.211-22, for which purpose we had to buy not fewer than eight examples ... The English ... would only sell us the engine in quantities ... to power no fewer than 100 aircraft. As a result, we did not get a sample ... &quot;

===Design, testing, and certification===

The design process at Ilyushin was managed by Sergey Ilyushin&#x27;s successor as head of the bureau, Heinrich Novozhilov. The timescale announced in 1973 envisaged first flight in 1976 and service entry in time for the Moscow Olympics in 1980.

The prototype flew at Khodynka airfield (where Ilyushin&#x27;s experimental factory was) on December 22, 1976 (Soviet airliners often flew before the close of calendar years to meet the requirements of five-year plans). It was announced that the type had a patented electromagnetic pulse deicing system. which used 500 times less energy than conventional deicers. It is claimed that over 50 new technological processes were introduced into Soviet practice as a result of the Il-86 programme.

The initial test programme was flown by Ilyushin staff, ending two months ahead of schedule on October 20, 1978. Other sources claim that these tests were completed on 22 September 1978. (According to a faster schedule announced at the time of the first flight, Ilyushin tests were to have ended in time for the 60th anniversary of the October Revolution on November 7, 1977.) In-house testing involved speeds up to Mach 0.93 and bank angles up to 11 degrees greater than specified.

Initial certification flying by pilots independent of Ilyushin ended on June 6, 1977. State acceptance trials began on April 24, 1979, and ended on December 24, 1980. Certification by Gosaviaregistr SSSR [the USSR State Aviation Registry] was granted under certificate number 10–86. The Il-86 entered Aeroflot service on 26 December the same year. The service-entry deadline of summer 1980, announced by Minister of Civil Aviation Boris Bugayev in 1977 had passed, however, and the Il-86 missed the Moscow Olympics in the summer of 1980.

Overall development of the Il-86 occupied over a decade. The length of this period was due to the sensitivity of the airliner&#x27;s configuration, problems with its powerplant, prolonged avionics development and the low priority of civil as opposed to military aircraft. In its earlier stages, the Il-86 programme was also held back by hopes of US airliner imports. Certificating the Il-86 to the very demanding set of Soviet and Comecon standards called NLGS-2 also delayed progress; it was the first Soviet aircraft to undergo a full certification programme since certification was introduced in the USSR in 1967 and became mandatory five years later.

===Manufacture===
Production of the Il-86 began in late 1976 and continued until 1991. There was no prototype. The first two machines were handmade by Ilyushin at the bureau&#x27;s own Moscow facility in 1976 and 1977. One was used for flight testing and the other for static ground testing.

Beyond these initial examples, Ministry of Aircraft Manufacture (&quot;MAP,&quot; &quot;Minaviaprom&quot;) Factory 64 at Voronezh (today VASO) was tasked with building more than half of each Il-86 and performing final assembly. Three aircraft were assembled at Voronezh by 1979. The first (flown on October 25, 1977) was built largely by hand, subsequent machines making increasing use of production equipment. These aircraft were used in certification and development flying before handover to Aeroflot. Voronezh factory production engineers conducted a &quot;redesign cycle&quot; of over 50 areas, cutting some 1,500 kg (3,300 lb) of airframe weight.
Capacity at Voronezh was insufficient and the Polish aircraft industry was involved in the Il-86 project from the start. The arrangement involved significant technology transfer to Poland: PZL (Państwowe Zakłady Lotnicze) Amalgamation Mielec factory Director Jerzy Belczak said it involved “... a radical retooling of our enterprise” involving “over 50 new processes.” Observers noted that &quot;work on the Il-86 will bring Poland&#x27;s ... WSK-Mielec to a new level of capability ... in the manufacturing processes involved with an aircraft of this size, including titanium structures, chemical milling and the machining of integral panels.&quot;

By the mid-1980s, PZL was planned to produce half of the Il-86, including the entire wing, and also to work on Il-86 developments (“Now we are preparing to manufacture units for the next model of the Il wide-body plane,” according to Belczak). From May 1977, the Polish factory manufactured entire empennages including tailplanes and the fin, all control surfaces, high-lift devices and engine pylons for the Il-86, representing &quot;about 16 per cent of these aircraft.&quot; Amid labour and political unrest in Poland from 1980 onwards, the Voronezh factory was instructed to retain wing manufacture.
After certification in 1980, annual Il-86 outputs were: 1980, 1; 1981, 0; 1982, 11; 1983, 12; 1984, 8; 1985, 9 (including the four for 8 ADON); 1986, 11; 1987, 10; 1988, 10; 1989, 9; 1990, 11 (including the three for export to China), 1991, 3. Of the 106 examples built, one never flew (being used for static tests) and three were exported.

The five-year plan in force when the USSR ceased to exist called for 40 more aircraft to be manufactured by 1995, but the manufacturing facility closed in early 1992.

==Design==
===Configuration and wing===
All-metal low-wing land monoplane with four wing-mounted low-bypass turbofan engines.

Cantilever three-spar structure of modified trapezoid planform. Centre section integral with fuselage. Inboard sections, outboard sections and detachable leading and trailing edges. High-lift devices comprise full-span six-segment leading edge slats (contiguous at engine pylons) at up to 17.5% of chord (drooping to 35°), two-segment fixed-vane double-slotted trailing edge flaps occupying some 75% of the span (deploying to 40°) and five-segment spoilers (outboards used as spoilerons at high speeds, inboards used as lift dumpers on the ground). Two-segment outboard ailerons for low speed roll control. Boundary layer fences over pylons. Engines suspended from the wing on pylons act as anti-flutter weights. Trim range is 16–33% of mean aerodynamic chord.

===Fuselage===
Circular-section structure of frames and stringers with a continuous main deck and lower decks fore and aft of the centre section. Rectangular windows in most interframe bays, eight ICAO Type 1a passenger doors on the main deck and three more on the lower deck portside; two freight hold doors and a galley supply door on the lower deck starboard. The main deck houses the flightdeck, two wardrobes, eight toilets, two pantries and a three-section passenger cabin. The lower deck houses three entry vestibules/luggage stores with hydraulic boarding stairs to ground level and fixed stairs to the main deck, a midships galley linked with the main deck by an electric lift, two freight holds (fore and aft of the passenger facilities), an avionics bay and two technical bays. The entire accommodation is pressurised and air-conditioned with &quot;earphones for music or on-board cinema.&quot;

===Empennage===
Cantilevered trapezoid planform swept-back surfaces. Two-segment elevators and rudder. Tailplane area ; incidence adjustable between 2° and 12° by electric motors commanded by yoke trim thumbwheels and console trim wheels. Fin area . Landing gear of near-conventional layout, with a twin-wheeled nose leg and three four-wheel bogie main gear legs (centreline and two outers). Track is .

===Powerplant===
Four Kuznetsov NK-86 two-spool with five-stage LP compressors, six-stage HP compressors, annular combustor cans, single-stage HP turbine and two-stage LP turbine turbofan engines power the Il-86. The cascade thrust reversers are canted 15° in respect to the horizontal axis. Pneumatic starters start the engines (airborne relights use the windmill effect). The forward-facing ejectors blow away detritus during taxi. International Standard Atmosphere hourly fuel consumption per engine is 7.7 t (16,975 lb) at maximum continuous rated thrust, 6 t/13,230 lb at nominal maximum thrust, 5.1 t (11,243 lb) at 85% thrust, 4.2 t/9260 lb at 70%, 3.6 t (7,937 lb) at 60%, 2.45 t (5,400 lb) at 40% and 1 t (2,205 lb) at idle. Overall hourly fuel consumption at long-range cruise and 190 t (419,000 lb) is 9.75 t (21,495 lb) reducing to 7.79 t (17,174 lb) at 140 t (308,650 lb). Outboard engine pylons on the latter two-thirds of all Il-86s are marginally extended to cut drag. The VSU-10 APU generates power and heats/cools the interior on the ground, and provides engine start air.

===Controls===
Hydraulically driven. An SAU-1T-2 automatic flight control system offers assisted manual or automatic flight, with no manual option. Four independent hydraulic systems power all flight controls and the built-in airstairs. Fluid is to the NGZh, rather than AMG, formula.

===Avionics===
Pizhma-1 navigational system with OMEGA inputs. GPS transceivers and a TCAS fitted retroactively during the 1990s. Pizhma-1 can be used throughout the flight from departure terminal area to landing and taxi to stand. Pizhma-1 has full-time roll and yaw dampers. Airfield approach aids enable instrument landing system-coupled approaches to ICAO Category II weather minima. Other radio aids include VOR and DME receivers, a weather radar, and Warsaw Pact identification aids. Cockpit voice recorders and flight data recorders standard. Four GT-40PCh6 engine generators generate energy from the Kuznetsov NK-86. The APU or ground sources supply 200/115 V, 400 Hz current to the primary system or two secondary systems (36 V/400 Hz AC and 27 V DC). Recipients include high-lift devices, tailplane trim, deicing, galley lift (elevator) and interior services.

===Service life===
The expected service life of an Il-86 is twenty years (up to 25) or 10,000 landings (from 20,000 up to 35,000 hours) prior to major servicing.

==Operational history==

===Civil operations===
An inaugural service from Moscow to Tashkent was flown on December 26, 1980, but services-proper commenced after February 1, 1981. Aeroflot first operated the Il-86 on peak domestic routes. Foreign services began in June 1981 to Eastern Europe. Services to larger West European cities began with the winter timetable starting in October that year. Charter flights to European points followed, with services on high-density medium/long-range routes within the Soviet Union coming last.

Although the Il-86 was a medium-range airliner, from 1982 Aeroflot put it into scheduled service from Moscow to Havana via Shannon and Gander, &quot;perhaps with limited payload or with additional tankerage.&quot; Other scheduled long-range services flown by the type were to Buenos Aires, Montevideo and Lima, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, all via Sal, Cape Verde.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, national airlines emerged in the 15 successor republics. Il-86s serving with Aeroflot administrations (&quot;Directorates&quot;) in these nations accrued to their airlines and many were traded. From April 2002, the European Union, the US and much of the rest of the world banned noisier aircraft, including the Il-86. On October 23, 2006, Aeroflot Deputy Director General Igor Desyatnichenko said that the Il-86 was to be withdrawn from service starting November 15 that year as it operated for just two or three months in the summer.&quot;

===Military operations===
With its built-in stairs and below deck holds, the Il-86 was widely expected to serve in the personnel transport role with the Soviet air forces: &quot;The wide-bodied Il-86 can perform not only as a troop transport ... but may also in the future form the basis for a command and control aircraft for airborne coordination of Warsaw Pact forces.&quot;

In the event, four airframes (c/n 042, 043, 046 and 048, carrying quasi-civil registrations SSSR-86146, &#x27;7, &#x27;8 and &#x27;9) were delivered to the 8th Special Purposes Aviation Division at the Chkalovsky air base near Moscow. These are variously claimed to be designated Il-80, Il-82, Il-87 or Il-86VKP (Russian: “ВКП” for “воздушный командный пост”; transliterated: &quot;vozdushniy komandnyi post&quot; “veh-kah-peh” and meaning &quot;aerial command post&quot;). This version has the NATO reporting name &quot;Maxdome&quot;.

===Marketing===

Il-86 provision to Aeroflot did not constitute a sale: it was part of the centralised Soviet supply and allocation system coordinated by offices called Gosplan and Gossnab which controlled the entirety of planning and distribution in the USSR (except the black market). Built aircraft were allocated to Aeroflot regions and Soviet Air Force units as follows (in order of first acceptance): the Vnukovo Aviation Entreprise, 21; the TsUMVS Administration of International Air Communications centred on Sheremetyevo Airport, 22; the Tashkent Air Enterprise, 9; the Sheremetyevo Air Enterprise, 10; the Pulkovo Air Enterprise, 8; the Alma-Ata Air Enterprise, 8; the Chkalovsky Soviet Air Force Base 8 ADON (or 8th Special Purposes Aviation Division), 4; the Kol&#x27;tsovo Air Enterprise, 6; the Tolmachevo Air Enterprise, 6; the Erevan Air Enterprise, 2; the Yemelyanovo Air Enterprise, 3.

Selling the Il-86 commercially (which under the Soviet system meant solely exports) was the job of the Soviet foreign trade organisation V/O Aviaeksport. The division of responsibilities between the influential TsAGI research establishment, design bureaux (acting like naval architects) which designed aeroplanes, factories (independent of the bureaux) which constructed them, independent service facilities which repaired them and an independent organisation which marketed them alongside designs by all other bureaux, has been seen as diluting responsibility for the fate of a product.

As part of supply provisions within the Comecon, Lot was allocated four Il-86s as barter for component manufacture; the airline deferred deliveries which were cancelled by 1987. In 1988 the East German airline Interflug is said to have prepared to take delivery of two Il-86s and to have allocated them the registrations DDR-AAA and DDR-AAB. Instead, that same year the airline took delivery of two Airbus A310s. The sole export order for the Il-86 − and the sole commercial transactions involving factory-built rather than secondhand examples − was by China Xinjiang Airlines which received three aircraft in 1990.
The first Il-86 to be built was displayed at the Paris Salon International de l&#x27;Aéronautique in 1977. It was noted that its interior used patented fire-resistant materials and hydraulics employed a fire-resistant fluid. At that time a version without the &quot;luggage at hand&quot; system was offered, seating 375 or alternatively weighing 3,000 kg (6,600 lb) less and having longer range. This version offered 7% lower seat-mile operational costs. The type was again displayed at Paris in 1979, 1981, 1983 and 1985, the Farnborough Air Show in 1984 and other world air events.
Setting records was a traditional Soviet way of promoting aviation products. On Tuesday September 22, 1981, an Il-86 flown by Commander G Volokhov and Second Pilot A Tyuryumin set Fédération Aéronautique Internationale records for flying payloads of 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60 and 65 tonnes over a 2,000 km closed circuit at an average of 975.3 km per hour. Two days later, the same crew and machine set FAI records for flying payloads of 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75 and 80-tonne payloads over a 1,000 km closed circuit at an average of 962 km/h. Of these 18 records, one was broken by a Tu-144 in 1983, five were superseded or discontinued and 12 still stood in 2010.
In September 1982 the type made a sales call on Bulgaria, followed by calls in July 1983 on Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Potential buyers received no hard information on the type in advance. Little solid information was given during the sales calls: &quot;constructor Novosilov sidestepped all questions [on fuel consumption] ... [the] chief pilot ... provided a measure of veiled explanation: &#x27;The consumption of the Il-86 is not higher than that of the Il-18,&#x27; he said.&quot; While welcomed as “proof of friendship with the USSR,” these sales calls failed to attract orders. Observers tacitly noted that the aircraft marked a 10/15-year lag by Soviet civil aviation compared with the West.

===Unused facilities===
The Il-86&#x27;s &quot;luggage at hand&quot; carry-on luggage facility was rarely used. Vul&#x27;fov, A, notes: &quot;Thank God no civil servant got it into his head to refuse the parallel opportunity offered to passengers of electing to drop their luggage when checking-in at airports. Otherwise, the loading of luggage into the aircraft by passengers would have turned into a proper nightmare lasting hours.&quot;

In 1987 Radio Moscow reported that Aeroflot &quot;resisted the change&quot; to a three-person crew. Vul&#x27;fov further reports that the type continued to be operated by four-member crews. Navigators, occupying the observer seat (devoid of instrumentation), stood unsecured on final approach to oversee the pilots&#x27; instruments and read-out indications (despite voice synthesizers being fitted). Soviet operations of the Tu-154 airliner similarly employed four or five flightdeck crew, despite foreign operators using three-person flightdeck crews.

==Undeveloped variants==

Only the base version of the Il-86 and a small batch of military derivatives entered service. Further versions were mooted but none entered service. Freight or combined passenger-freight versions are not known to have been proposed.

===Proposed long-range version===

On June 26, 1972, a long-range version of the Il-86, the Il-86D (for Russian: &quot;дальний&quot;; transliterated: &quot;dal’niy&quot;; meaning &quot;long-range&quot;), was ordered into development by the Soviet cabinet. Design was completed in June 1976. The Il-86D would have had a marginally extended wing span, carried additional fuel, and had a range of some 8,500 km (4,600 nmi). Later announcements stated that a version of the Il-86D with Lotarev D-18 engines had entered development in March 1975. This version would have had a 147,500 kg (325,000 lb) empty weight, a 300,000 kg/660,000 lb maximum take-off weight, a fuel capacity of some 150,000 kg (330,000 lb), a wing area of 325 m2 (5,300 ft2), and a range of 10,200 km (5,500 nmi). It evolved into the Il-96.

===Proposed high-capacity version===

A &quot;minimum-change&quot; development of the Il-86, stated to have been designated Il-86V, was test-flown on 1 June 1982 and was ready for service by 27 April 1985. It was said to have 450 seats, with the underfloor vestibules fitted with seats and possible changes to main-deck seating. The version is not known to have entered passenger service but may have been used by the military.

===Proposed re-engined versions===

In the 1980s, there were moves to fit the Il-86 with RB211-22 engines. Designated Il-86V (second use of this designation), this would have had a range of over 9,000 km (4,860 nmi) and/or increased payload. Another 450-seater Il-86V powered by RB211-524G engines was also projected. Amid the disintegration of the Soviet economy, these versions did not progress.

In 1991, there were moves to fit the Il-86 with Franco-American CFM56-5C2 engines. Finances precluded progress. In 1995, International Aero Engines offered the V2500 engine to five Il-86 operators with proposals to re-engine 25 aircraft. The offer was not taken up.

==Operators==
===Military===
As of 2020, three modified Ilyushin Il-86VKP remained in service with the Russian Air Force, down from four aircraft in 2010. The type had already been operated by and taken over from the former Soviet Air Force.

===Civil===
As of May 2011, no civilian Il-86s remained in service. The following airlines used to operate Il-86s aircraft for civil passenger or freight operations:

==Accidents and incidents==
As of August 2013, the Il-86 is known to have been involved in at least 10 incidents, including 4 hull losses with a total of 23 fatalities unrelated to passengers. During its passenger-carrying operations the Il-86 has not been involved in any fatal accident.

The following are reported significant recorded safety events involving the Il-86:
* On an unknown date in 1980, the aircraft registered SSSR-86004 (constructor&#x27;s number 51483200002 [&quot;002&quot;]) experienced a fire in engine No 4 on departure from Vnukovo on an acceptance testing flight; the crew initially shut down No. 1 in error, then No. 4, but landed safely on the reciprocal runway to the one from which they had departed, after performing a 180° turn. No casualties. The investigation into this fire resulted in a modification to the engine.
* In 1984, SSSR-86011 (c/n 009) was found to have suffered a tail strike on landing at Simferopol. No casualties.
* On March 8, 1994, RA-86119 (c/n 087) parked at Delhi airport was struck by debris of crashing Sahara India Boeing 737 (VT-SIA) flown by a trainee; both aircraft were destroyed. All 4 crew on the 737 were killed. Two Aeroflot employees and Russian ground engineer died inside Il-86 due to fire and an airport worker was killed on the ground.
* In 1998, RA-86080 (c/n 051) was found to have been overstressed, most likely by a recent heavy landing, and repairs were considered inexpedient in view of coming retirement. No casualties; aircraft broken up at Sheremetyevo Airport in 2001.
* On May 1, 2000, RA-86113 (c/n 081) suffered an apparent engine failure and fire on departure from Sochi. The flight crew brought the machine to a safe overweight landing. The failure and fire indications were found to have been spurious. No casualties.
* On August 26, 2000, RA-86066 (c/n 033) experienced a failure and fire in No 2 engine shortly after take-off from Moscow Sheremetyevo for Barcelona. The crew landed on the reciprocal runway with no further incident. No casualties.
* On September 21, 2001, RA-86074 (c/n 041) operating as Aeroflot Flight 521 belly-landed at Dubai after a flight from Moscow, the flight crew having switched off the ground proximity warning due to heavy workload on the approach and then neglected to extend the landing gear; no casualties; aircraft written off.
* On July 28, 2002, Pulkovo Aviation Enterprise Flight 9560 RA-86060 (c/n 027) crashed shortly after departure from Moscow on a repositioning flight to Saint Peterburg. The trim toggle button on the control column caused a spontaneous retrimming of the tailplane, rapid transition to nose-heavy trim and a dive. The four flightdeck crew, two ground support staff and ten cabin crew aboard the aircraft died, making the crash the deadliest aviation accident involving the Il-86. The two injured survivors were cabin crew members.

Following the Moscow crash in July 2002, the MAK Interstate Aviation Committee withdrew the Il-86&#x27;s certificate of airworthiness, temporarily grounding the type. The certificate was rapidly restored in stages by early 2003. The accident prompted the Egyptian civil aviation authorities to attempt to ban Il-86 operations to Egypt. Amid continuing negotiations, by 2007 the intention had lapsed, with intensive Il-86 operations to and from Egypt continuing.

<text>The Ilyushin Il-18 (; NATO reporting name: Coot) is a large turboprop airliner that first flew in 1957 and became one of the best known Soviet aircraft of its era. The Il-18 was one of the world&#x27;s principal airliners for several decades and was widely exported. Due to the aircraft&#x27;s durability, many examples achieved over 45,000 flight hours and the type remains operational in both military and (to a lesser extent) civilian capacities. The Il-18&#x27;s successor was the longer-range Ilyushin Il-62.

==Design and development==
Two Soviet aircraft shared the designation Ilyushin Il-18. The first Il-18 was a propeller-driven airliner of 1946 but after a year of test flights that programme was abandoned.

In the early 1950s with a need to replace older designs and increase the size of the Soviet civil transport fleet, a Soviet Council of Ministers directive was issued on 30 December 1955 to the chief designers Kuznetsov and Ivchenko to develop new turboprop engines and to Ilyushin and Antonov to design an aircraft to use these engines. The two aircraft designs were developed as the Ilyushin Il-18 and the Antonov An-10 and the engine chosen was the Kuznetsov NK-4 rather than the Ivchenko AI-20.

The Il-18 design had started in 1954 before the directive was issued and experience with the piston-engined Il-18 was used although the aircraft was a new design. The design was for a four-engined low-wing monoplane with a circular pressurised fuselage and a conventional tail. The forward retracting tricycle landing gear had four wheels fitted on the main leg bogies, the main legs bogies rotated 90 degrees and retracted into the rear of the inboard engines. A new feature at the time was the fitting of a weather radar in the nose and it was the first Soviet airliner to have an automatic approach system. The aircraft has two entry doors on the port-side before and after the wing and two overwing emergency exits on each side.

The prototype SSSR-L5811 was rolled out in June 1957 and after ground-testing it began taxi test and high-speed runs on 1 July 1957. On 4 July 1957 the prototype first flew from Khodynka. On 10 July 1957 the aircraft was flown to Moscow-Vnukovo Airport to be presented to a Soviet government commission; also present was the prototype Antonov An-10 and the Tupolev Tu-114. The Il-18 type was formally named &quot;Moskva&quot; and this was painted on the fuselage, although the name was not used when the aircraft entered production.

The Moscow Machinery Plant No. 30 located at Khodynka, near where the Ilyushin design office and the prototype had been built, was chosen to manufacture the aircraft. During 1957 the plant began to reduce its production of the Ilyushin Il-14 and prepare to build the production aircraft designated IL-18A. The Il-18A was only different from the prototype in minor details, mainly internal configuration to increase the seating from 75 to 89.
The first production aircraft were powered by the Kuznetsov NK-4 but the engines were plagued with problems so the Council of Ministers decreed in July 1958 that all production from November 1958 would use the Ivchenko AI-20 and earlier production would be re-engined. Only 20 IL-18As were built before production changed to the improved Il-18B, this new variant had a higher gross weight and the nose was re-designed with a larger radome which increased the length by 20 cm. The first Il-18B flew on 30 September 1958 powered by the AI-20; a VIP variant was also built as the IL-18S for the Soviet Air Force. From April 1961 a TG-18 Auxiliary Power Unit was fitted for ground starting rather than the bank of lead-acid batteries. Some aircraft were modified to allow the APU to be run in flight.

With experience of the earlier aircraft a further improvement was the Il-18V variant. The Il-18V was structurally the same but the interior was re-designed including moving the galley and some minor system changes. The first Il-18V appeared in December 1959 and was to continue into production until 1965 after 334 had been built. Specialised variants of the aircraft also appeared, including aircraft modified for flight calibration and a long-range polar variant. Military variants also appeared including the anti-submarine Ilyushin Il-38.

==Operational history==

The first Il-18, initially equipped with Kuznetsov NK-4 engines, flew on 4 July 1957. On 17 September 1958 the aircraft first flew with the new Ivchenko AI-20 engines. Vladimir Kokkinaki was the test pilot. Between 1958 and 1960 twenty-five world records were set by this aircraft, among them flight range and altitude records with various payloads. In 1958 the aircraft was awarded the Brussels World Fair Grand Prix. In April 1979 a monument was unveiled at Sheremetyevo airport to commemorate the aircraft.

Seventeen foreign air carriers acquired some 125 Il-18 aircraft, seating 100-120 passengers. Il-18s are still in service in Siberia, North Korea and the Middle East, whilst a number of examples manufactured in the mid-1960s were still in civilian use in Africa and south Asia as of 2014. The type operates in various military capacities, including the Il-22PP electronic warfare and reconnaissance aircraft which entered service in October 2016. A modernized Il-20M with improved radar, radio and optical-electronic reconnaissance equipment entered service in July 2020 to provide secure targeting to Kh-47M2 Kinzhal missile system.

An Il-18 (registration DDR-STD) belonging to Interflug and used as a transport by East German leaders, including Erich Honecker, has been converted into a static hotel suite at Teuge Airfield in The Netherlands.

As of July 2018, there are 7 aircraft in airliner service with 6 operators.

The Il-18/20/22 are serving in the Russian Air Force as reconnaissance and command post aircraft.

On 17 September 2018, an Il-20M was accidentally shot down with 15 people on board near Latakia, Syria.

On 24 June 2023, an airborne command-center Il-22 was shot down during the Wagner Group rebellion. All ten crew members were killed.
On 14 January 2024 by Ukrainian media sources reported that an Il-22 was shot down along the sea of Azov. The aircraft successfully crash landed at Anapa Airport. It was claimed to have been damaged beyond repair. A spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force remarked that it was a &quot;Tenacious bastard.&quot;

<text>Folland Aircraft was a British aircraft manufacturing company which was active between 1937 and 1963.

==History==

British Marine Aircraft Limited was formed in February 1936 to produce Sikorsky S-42-A flying boats under licence in the UK. The company built a factory on the western side of the Hamble peninsula with a slipway to Southampton Water. The construction of one Sikorsky based aircraft was started at Hamble, however the company ran out of money and liquidators were appointed. Mergers with other British aircraft companies were considered, including one with Westland Aircraft, but none was followed up.

In 1937 Henry Folland, chief designer of Gloster Aircraft, was looking for a new opportunity to pursue his own ideas without management hindrance. He left Gloster, took over the British Marine site and set up the Folland Aircraft Company. He took the positions of both managing director and aircraft designer.

Folland began aircraft assembly at Hamble making parts for Bristol Blenheim and Beaufort bombers. Follands also made 15,000 rear portions out of the 22,000 constructed for the Supermarine Spitfire. Folland later took on sub-contract work making parts for de Havilland Mosquitos and Vickers Wellingtons.

The first aircraft of its own design to fly was the Folland Fo.108 in 1940. Designed and built to meet the Air Ministry Specification 43/37 for a flying engine testbed it was generally known as the 43/47 or by the nickname &quot;Folland Frightful&quot; from its unusual appearance.

The Folland F.115 and F.116 designs were tendered to meet Specification E.28/40 for a research aircraft to investigate the issues of landing weight for aircraft operating from carriers. The F.116 design was powered by a Centaurus radial and used a variable incidence wing on an airframe estimated at around 18,250 lb (8,300 kg). Two prototypes were ordered but the project was cancelled in 1943 as most of the problems had already been overcome, and neither prototype was completed.

W. E. W. Petter, who had designed the Westland Lysander, English Electric Canberra and English Electric Lightning, joined the company as managing director in 1950. He designed the Folland Midge as an unarmed proof-of-concept demonstrator for a lightweight jet fighter which first flew 11 August 1954. This was followed by the Folland Gnat, the prototype of which, serial number &quot;G-39-2&quot;, flew on 18 July 1955. Although RAF interest in the possibilities for using the Gnat as a fighter had waned, Folland identified another potential use for the type as an advanced trainer aircraft. The prototype Gnat Trainer conducted its maiden flight on 31 August 1959. Both were built at Hamble until the 1960s with the final Gnat T.1 for the RAF being delivered in May 1965. Follands used an airfield at Chilbolton formerly RAF Chilbolton where they Flight Tested the Folland Midge and the versions of the Folland Gnat.

In 1959 Folland was acquired by Hawker Siddeley which dropped the Folland name in 1963. Ultimately, Folland became part of British Aerospace (BAe). Although Hamble airfield closed in 1986, BAe continued to use the premises there for the production of major assemblies for Harrier and Hawk jets.

<text>The Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, also known as Campaign Plan Granite II, was an offensive launched by United States forces against Imperial Japanese forces in the Pacific Ocean between June and November 1944 during the Pacific War. The campaign consisted of Operation Forager, which captured the Mariana Islands, and Operation Stalemate, which captured Palau. Operation Causeway, the invasion of Taiwan was also planned but not executed. The offensive, under the overall command of Chester W. Nimitz, followed the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign and was intended to neutralize Japanese bases in the central Pacific, support the Allied drive to retake the Philippines, and provide bases for a strategic bombing campaign against Japan.

The United States invasion force was supported by a massive combat force. The Fifth Fleet was commanded by Admiral Raymond A. Spruance. Task Force 58, commanded by Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher, consisted of 15 carriers, 7 battleships, 11 cruisers, 86 destroyers and over 900 planes. The invasion force, commanded by Vice Admiral Richmond K. Turner, consisted of 56 attack transports, 84 landing craft and over 127,000 troops.

Beginning the offensive, United States Marine Corps and United States Army forces, with support from the United States Navy, executed landings on Saipan in June 1944. In response, the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s Combined Fleet sortied to attack the U.S. Navy fleet supporting the landings. In the resulting aircraft carrier Battle of the Philippine Sea (the so-called &quot;Great Marianas Turkey Shoot&quot;) on 19–20 June, the Japanese naval forces were decisively defeated with heavy and irreplaceable losses to their carrier-borne and land-based aircraft.

U.S. forces executed landings on Saipan in June 1944 and Guam and Tinian in July 1944. After heavy fighting, Saipan was secured in July and Guam and Tinian in August 1944. The U.S. then constructed airfields on Saipan and Tinian where B-29s were based to conduct strategic bombing missions against the Japanese home islands until the end of World War II, including the nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

In the meantime, in order to secure the flank for U.S. forces preparing to attack Japanese forces in the Philippines, in September 1944, U.S. Marine and Army forces landed on the islands of Peleliu and Angaur in Palau. After heavy and intense combat on Peleliu and Angaur, both islands were finally secured by U.S. forces in November 1944, while the main Japanese garrison in the Palaus on Koror was passed by altogether, only to surrender in August 1945 with the Empire’s capitulation.

Following their landings in the Mariana and Palau Islands, Allied forces continued their ultimately successful campaign against Japan by landing in the Philippines in October 1944 and the Volcano and Ryukyu Islands beginning in January 1945.

<text>PZL (&quot;Państwowe Zakłady Lotnicze&quot; - State Aviation Works) was the largest Polish aerospace manufacturer of the interwar period, and a brand of their aircraft. Based in Warsaw between 1928 and 1939, PZL introduced a variety of well-regarded aircraft, most notably the PZL P.11 fighter, the PZL.23 Karaś light bomber, and the PZL.37 Łoś medium bomber.

In the post-war era, aerospace factories in Poland were initially run under the name WSK (Transport Equipment Manufacturing Plant), but returned to adopt PZL acronym in late 1950s. This was used as a common aircraft brand and later as a part of names of several Polish state-owned aerospace manufacturers referring to PZL traditions, and belonging to the &quot;Zjednoczenie Przemysłu Lotniczego i Silnikowego PZL&quot; - PZL Aircraft and Engine Industry Union. Among the better-known products during this period is the PZL TS-11 Iskra jet trainer and PZL-104 Wilga STOL utility aircraft.

After the fall of communism in Poland in 1989, these manufacturers became separate companies, still sharing the PZL name. In the case of PZL Mielec, the abbreviation was later developed as &quot;Polskie Zakłady Lotnicze&quot; - Polish Aviation Works. Over time, the now-separate divisions were purchased by foreign concerns but many continue to use the PZL brand.

==History==
===PZL (1928–1939)===
Państwowe Zakłady Lotnicze was established in Warsaw in 1928 as a state-owned company, and was based on the earlier Centralne Warsztaty Lotnicze - Central Aviation Workshops. First to be produced was a licensed version of a French fighter, the Wibault 70, but from then on the company produced exclusively its own designs. In the next decade a talented designer Zygmunt Puławski designed a series of high-wing, all-metal modern fighters: PZL P.1, P.6, P.7 and P.11. The latter two types were used as basic fighters in the Polish Air Force from 1933 onwards. The last variant, PZL P.24, developed after Puławski&#x27;s death in an air crash, was exported to four countries. PZL also mass-produced a light bomber, PZL.23 Karaś, and a modern medium bomber, PZL.37 Łoś, as well as building small numbers of sport aircraft (PZL.5, PZL.19, PZL.26), and liaison aircraft (PZL Ł.2); and developing prototypes of passenger aircraft. In the late 1930s the company also developed several prototypes of more modern fighters and bombers — and a passenger airliner, the PZL.44 Wicher. However, World War II prevented these aircraft from entering production. PZL was the largest Polish pre-war aircraft manufacturer.

In 1934, the main factory in Warsaw was named PZL WP-1 (&quot;Wytwórnia Płatowców 1&quot; - Airframe Works 1) in the Okęcie district of Warsaw. A new division PZL WP-2 was built in Mielec in 1938-1939, but production was only just starting there at the outbreak of World War II. An engine factory division, PZL WS-1 in Warsaw-Okęcie (&quot;Wytwórnia Silników&quot; - Engine Works 1), produced mostly licensed versions of British Bristol engines, such as the Bristol Pegasus and the Bristol Mercury. The WS-1 factory was former &quot;Polskie Zakłady Skody&quot;, the Polish division of Skoda Works, and was nationalized and renamed in 1936. In 1937-1939 a new engine division, PZL WS-2, was built in Rzeszów.

===Situation post-war===
During World War II and the five-year German occupation, all Polish aviation industry was taken over by German firms, and as a result, almost completely destroyed. By the end of the war, all factories were either ruined or robbed of tooling. Despite it, from 1944 there were carried out efforts to design new aircraft, in primitive conditions (first of all, in the LWD). No engines nor suitable production facilities were available at first. The post-war communist government of Poland wanted to break all connections with pre-war Poland: from the late 1940s the name PZL ceased to be used, and new aerospace factories were named WSK (&quot;Wytwórnia Sprzętu Komunikacyjnego&quot; - Transport Equipment Manufacturing Plant). Under the Soviet-influenced, centrally planned economy, all indigenous projects were abandoned, in a favour of manufacturing Soviet-licensed aircraft. No own designs were produced for a decade, and only in late 1950s, after the stalinist period (1956), did the PZL brand return to designing new aircraft.

The ZPLiS PZL - &quot;Zjednoczenie Przemysłu Lotniczego i Silnikowego PZL&quot; - PZL Aircraft and Engine Industry Union, which grouped all state-owned aerospace industry factories, was created in following years, but it only enjoyed some economic autonomy from 1973 onwards. It consisted of 19 factories, a research institute, and the Pezetel Foreign Trade Center - CHZ Pezetel, which represented all the Polish aerospace industry abroad (&quot;Pezetel&quot; being the pronunciation of an abbreviation PZL in Polish). Consequently, in the 1970s some WSK factories also introduced the PZL abbreviation to their names. After the fall of communism in Poland in 1989, all manufacturers became separate companies, initially state-owned, still sharing the PZL name.

==Locations==
===PZL &quot;Warszawa-Okęcie&quot;===
The main factory PZL WP-1 in Warsaw was destroyed during World War II, mostly during the German evacuation in 1944. In 1946, the CSS construction bureau (&quot;Centralne Studium Samolotów&quot; - Central Aircraft Study) was set up there. As the factory was rebuilt, it was renamed in 1950 as the WSK Nr.4, and in 1956 as the WSK-Okęcie.

It first produced licensed versions of Soviet types and aircraft developed by other Polish companies. From 1958 onwards it started to produce its own designs under the PZL brand, starting with the PZL-101 Gawron. The factory developed mainly light sports, trainer and utility aircraft. An attempt of producing and airliner PZL MD-12 was unsuccessful. The best-known designs are the PZL-104 Wilga utility aircraft, which was produced in larger numbers than any other Polish-designed aircraft; and the PZL-106 Kruk agricultural aircraft. During the 1970s the factory adopted the name WSK &quot;PZL Warszawa-Okęcie&quot;, which after the fall of the communist system was changed in 1989 to PZL Warszawa-Okęcie. In 2001 the factory was bought by the Spanish company EADS CASA (now part of Airbus Defence and Space) and since then has been known as EADS PZL Warszawa-Okęcie SA.

===WSK &quot;PZL-Mielec&quot; / PZL Mielec===
The PZL WP2 factory in Mielec became a part of Heinkel during the German occupation of Poland, and manufactured parts for German aircraft. After the war the factory was named first PZL No.1 works, then from 1949 WSK-Mielec, and later WSK &quot;PZL-Mielec&quot;. It became the biggest post-war Polish aircraft producer. It manufactured mostly licensed Soviet types, such as the Antonov An-2 transport biplane and early jet fighters: Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 (as Lim-1 and Lim-2) and Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17 (as Lim-5 and Lim-6). It also produced the Polish-designed TS-8 Bies piston trainer and TS-11 Iskra jet trainer, and the PZL M-15 Belphegor the world&#x27;s only jet agricultural aircraft. Large numbers of aircraft were exported abroad, mostly to the USSR. From the 1970s onward it produced mostly its own developments of licensed civil aircraft, the best known are the PZL M-18 Dromader agricultural aircraft, which was exported to numerous countries, and the PZL M-28 Skytruck/Bryza light transport aircraft. In 1998 the state factory WSK PZL-Mielec went bankrupt and was changed into the state-owned &quot;Polskie Zakłady Lotnicze&quot; Sp.z o.o. (Polish Aviation Works) (PZL Mielec).

On March 16, 2007, PZL Mielec was purchased by the Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, a unit of United Technologies Corporation (UTX). It still produces M-18 and M-28 aircraft.

===WSK &quot;PZL-Świdnik&quot;===
In 1951 a third national aerospace factory, WSK-Świdnik, was built in Świdnik, and in 1957 it was renamed to WSK &quot;PZL-Świdnik&quot;. Since 1956 it has become one of the world&#x27;s major helicopter manufacturers, producing helicopters under Soviet licences, starting from the SM-1 (Mil Mi-1). Świdnik was the main producer of the Mi-1 and the exclusive producer of the Mil Mi-2, which was widely used throughout the world. Since the late 1980s, Świdnik has been producing a Polish-designed medium helicopter PZL W-3 Sokół. It also produces a light helicopter, the PZL SW-4 Puszczyk. After 1991 the state factory became a state-owned corporation (WSK &quot;PZL-Świdnik&quot; SA). It also produced the SZD-30 Pirat, PW-5 and PW-6 gliders and cooperates widely with other nations&#x27; manufacturers, &quot;e.g.&quot;, in the manufacture of Agusta A109 fuselages.

In early 2010 the factory was acquired by AgustaWestland.

===PZL-Bielsko / Allstar PZL Glider===
Glider manufacturer SZD (&quot;Szybowcowy Zakład Doświadczalny&quot; - Glider Experimental Works) was created in Bielsko-Biała in 1948. The company grew and had production plants in additional locations, during this process it was renamed several times until it got its name PZL-Bielsko in the 1990s. It was one of the biggest sailplane factories and exported its gliders world-wide.

In 2002 Allstar PZL Glider Sp. z o.o. acquired the production plant in Bielsko-Biala and the Type Certificates of the following SZD sailplanes: SZD-59-1 Acro - a single-seater for aerobatics and cross-country, SZD-54-2 Perkoz – a double-seater training-glider for aerobatic and cross-country, SZD-55-1 Nexus – a single seater glider of the standard class, SZD-51-1 Junior - single seater training glider of the club class, SZD-50 Puchacz - double-seater training-glider and SZD-48-3 Jantar Standard 3 – single-seater glider of standard class.

The company further manufactures and develops the first four SZD-glider models. Allstar PZL Glider is also producing and distributing spare parts for all six types mentioned above.
On the occasion of the air show “Aero” 2019 in Friedrichshafen Allstar PZL Glider has presented its proof-of-concept of a new electric propulsion system for the SZD-55 Nexus. The electric sustainer, developed by the company and named “Allstar-e-motion”, is right now in the advanced certification process. The system will also be available as an assembly kit for retrofitting of existing SZD-55s.

===WSK-Rzeszów===
The engine division WS-2 of the PZL was built in Rzeszów in 1937-1939. After the war it still bore a name PZL (&quot;Państwowe Zakłady Lotnicze&quot;) until 1951, when it was renamed WSK-Rzeszów. From 1949 it manufactured Soviet-licensed M-11 engines, later, among others, ASh-62IR, turboshaft engines GTD-350 and Polish jet engines SO-1. The factory was bought by United Technologies in 2002 and changed its name to Pratt &amp; Whitney Rzeszów in 2015.

===WSK &quot;PZL-Kalisz&quot;===
In 1952 the engine manufacturer WSK-Kalisz was created. It manufactured mostly Soviet-licensed engines, first piston (the Shvetsov ASh-82 and the Ivchenko AI-14) and then jet (the Klimov VK-1). It also produced Polish piston engines, such as the WN-3, and other equipment. In October 1996 it was renamed WSK &quot;PZL-Kalisz&quot; and became a corporation (SA).

===WSK &quot;PZL Warszawa II&quot;===
WSK Warszawa II was created in 1952 in Warsaw as a manufacturer of aircraft parts and military equipment parts. In 1995 it was changed from a state factory to a corporation WSK &quot;PZL Warszawa II&quot; SA.

<doc id="229870" wikidata="Q76688" url="?curid=229870" title="Hans-Hermann Hoppe">
<text>Hans-Hermann Hoppe (; ; born 2 September 1949) is a German-American academic associated with Austrian School economics, anarcho-capitalism, right-wing libertarianism, and opposition to democracy. He is professor emeritus of economics at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), senior fellow of the Mises Institute think tank, and the founder and president of the Property and Freedom Society.

Hoppe has written extensively in opposition to democracy, notably in his 2001 book &quot;&quot;. The book favors exclusionary &quot;covenant communities&quot; that are &quot;founded for the purpose of protecting family and kin&quot;. A section of the book favoring exclusion of democrats and homosexuals from society helped popularize Hoppe on the far-right.

Hoppe was a protégé of Murray Rothbard, who established him at UNLV, where Hoppe taught from 1986 to 2008. In 2004, a student&#x27;s complaint about Hoppe&#x27;s lecture comments regarding homosexuals and time preference led to an investigation and non-disciplinary letter to Hoppe by UNLV, which was subsequently withdrawn after a controversy over academic freedom.

Hoppe founded the Property and Freedom Society in 2006; among the speakers at the organization&#x27;s conferences in Turkey, some have been white nationalists.

==Early life and education==
Hoppe was born in Peine, West Germany.

Hoppe completed his undergraduate studies at Saarland University and received his MA and PhD degrees from Goethe University Frankfurt. He studied under Jürgen Habermas, a leading German intellectual of the post-WWII era, but came to reject Habermas&#x27;s ideas and European leftism generally.

He was a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Michigan, in Ann Arbor, from 1976 to 1978 and earned his habilitation in Foundations of Sociology and Economics from the University of Frankfurt in 1981.

Afterward he taught in West Germany and Italy. From 1986 until his retirement in 2008, Hoppe was a professor in the School of Business at University of Nevada, Las Vegas. He is a Distinguished Fellow of the Mises Institute, a libertarian think tank that is publisher of much of his work, and was editor of various Mises Institute periodicals.

Hoppe has said that Murray Rothbard was his &quot;principal teacher, mentor and master&quot;. Hoppe came to the United States through Rothbard on a scholarship from the Center for Libertarian Studies, and Rothbard also established Hoppe at UNLV. Hoppe said he was &quot;working and living side-by-side with him, in constant and immediate personal contact,&quot; and said that from 1985 until Rothbard&#x27;s 1995 death, he considered Rothbard his &quot;dearest fatherly friend&quot;.

=== Mises Institute and John Randolph Club ===

The Mises Institute was founded in 1982 by Lew Rockwell, Burton Blumert, and Murray Rothbard, following a split between the Cato Institute and Rothbard, who had been one of the founders of the Cato Institute. After Rothbard&#x27;s death in 1996, Hoppe was a leading anarcho-capitalist figure at the Mises Institute.

Hoppe was active in the John Randolph Club, a far-right alliance of paleolibertarians and paleoconservatives that was organized by Rothbard and associated with the Rockford Institute. The club was known for promoting secessionist and neo-Confederate views in the 1990s.

===Property and Freedom Society===
In 2006, Hoppe founded The Property and Freedom Society (PFS), with annual conferences in Bodrum, Turkey. It and the Mises Institute represent a paleolibertarian challenge to the Mont Pelerin Society and Atlas Network of think tanks. Figures of the European New Right and the American alt-right have attended PFS conferences. Quinn Slobodian and Dieter Plehwe describe Hoppe as a &quot;racialist right-wing libertarian&quot;, and Slobodian writes that the conferences have included members of the former John Randolph Club along with &quot;new advocates of stateless libertarianism and racial secession&quot;.

On the fifth anniversary of PFS, Hoppe reflected on its goals: &quot;On the one hand, positively, it was to explain and elucidate the legal, economic, cognitive and cultural requirements and features of a free, state-less natural order. On the other hand, negatively, it was to unmask the State and showcase it for what it really is: an institution run by gangs of murderers, plunderers and thieves, surrounded by willing executioners, propagandists, sycophants, crooks, liars, clowns, charlatans, dupes and useful idiots – an institution that dirties and taints everything it touches.&quot;

Hoppe was criticized for inviting white nationalist speakers such as Jared Taylor and neo-Nazi Richard B. Spencer to speak at the PFS. Describing the PFS, the Southern Poverty Law Center said in 2016 that &quot;in Hoppe one can see the connection between the ultra-Libertarians and white nationalists&quot;. &quot;Intelligencer&quot; in 2017 described the annual PFS meeting as &quot;Davos, but for racists&quot;. Slobodian wrote in 2023 that &quot;prophets of racial and social breakdown share the stage with investment advisors and financial consultants&quot; at the conferences.

==Views==

=== On democracy ===
Hoppe&#x27;s book &quot;&quot;, published in 2001, argues that democracy is a cause of civilizational decline. Passages in the book oppose universal suffrage and favor &quot;natural elites&quot;. In the book, Hoppe blames democratic forms of government for various social and economic problems, and attributes democracy&#x27;s failures to pressure groups which seek to increase government expenditures and regulations. Hoppe proposes alternatives and remedies, including secession, decentralization of government, and &quot;complete freedom of contract, occupation, trade and migration&quot;. Hoppe argues that monarchy would preserve individual liberty more effectively than democracy. The book helped popularize Hoppe in the far-right, particularly a section of the book that called for the exclusion of political rivals.

Janek Wasserman writes that Hoppe &quot;reimagined the Austrian legacy as one of authoritarianism, conservatism, antidemocracy, and anti-Enlightenment&quot;. Steven Horwitz called the approaches of Hoppe and his Mises Institute colleague Joseph Salerno &quot;a fascist fist in a libertarian glove&quot;. The political scientist George Hawley writes that Hoppe &quot;may be the most important bridge between libertarianism and the Alt-Right&quot;. Hawley notes that Hoppe has argued that &quot;libertarians must actually be radical conservatives&quot;, and that libertarians must favor a right to discrimination, including on the basis of race.

In Hoppe&#x27;s view, Wasserman writes, &quot;the successes of the fin-de-siecle age—and the Austrian school—were not the product of liberal predominance or cosmopolitan virtues but of the ancien régime and its restrictive social order&quot;. Regarding democracy and the arts, Hoppe argued in 2013 that &quot;democracy leads to the subversion and ultimately disappearance of the notion of beauty and universal standards of beauty. Beauty is swamped and submerged by so-called &#x27;modern art&#x27;.&quot; 

Reviewing &quot;Democracy: The God That Failed&quot;, Walter Block, a colleague of Hoppe&#x27;s at the Mises Institute, wrote that Hoppe&#x27;s arguments shed light &quot;on historical occurrences, from wars to poverty to inflation to interest rates to crime&quot;. While Hoppe concedes that 21st-century democracies are more prosperous than the monarchies of old, Hoppe argues that if nobles and kings replaced today&#x27;s political leaders, their ability to take a long-term view of a country&#x27;s well-being would &quot;improve matters&quot;, Block wrote. Block shared what he called minor criticisms of Hoppe&#x27;s theses regarding time preferences, immigration and the gap between libertarianism and conservatism.

Alberto Benegas-Lynch Jr., a professor of economics at the University of Buenos Aires who is associated with the libertarian Cato Institute, criticized Hoppe&#x27;s thesis that monarchy is preferable to democracy. Benegas-Lynch provided evidence that modern monarchies tend to be far poorer than modern democracies. In response, Hoppe argued that comparing mostly African monarchies with mostly European democracies led to a distortion.

Asked by &quot;The Intercept&quot; in 2021 about his incorporation into far-right internet memes celebrating political murder, Hoppe responded that the question was ignorant, writing, &quot;I have been an intellectual champion of private property right, free markets, freedom of contract and association, and peace&quot;, and, &quot;What do I know? There are lots of crazy people out there!&quot;

=== Covenant communities and discrimination ===
In &quot;Democracy: The God That Failed,&quot; Hoppe argues in favor of property owners&#x27; right to establish communities with exclusive criteria for admission and acceptance. Hoppe describes a society of &quot;covenant communities&quot; made up of residents who have signed an agreement defining the nature of that community. Hoppe believes that these covenant communities should have the right to certain forms of discrimination, including the physical separation of people whose lifestyle is deemed incompatible with the norms of that community. He writes that &quot;There would be little or no &#x27;tolerance&#x27; and &#x27;openmindedness&#x27; so dear to left-libertarians. Instead, one would be on the right path toward restoring the freedom of association and exclusion implied in the institution of private property&quot;.

Hoppe writes: &quot;In a covenant concluded among proprietor and community tenants for the purpose of protecting their private property, no such thing as a right to free (unlimited) speech exists, . . . naturally no one is permitted to advocate ideas contrary to the very purpose of the covenant of preserving and protecting private property, such as democracy and communism. There can be no tolerance toward democrats and communists in a libertarian social order. They will have to be physically separated and expelled from society. Likewise, in a covenant founded for the purpose of protecting family and kin, there can be no tolerance toward those habitually promoting lifestyles incompatible with this goal. They – the advocates of alternative, non-family and kin-centered lifestyles such as, for instance, individual hedonism, parasitism, nature-environment worship, homosexuality, or communism – will have to be physically removed from society, too, if one is to maintain a libertarian order.&quot;

Commenting on this passage, Martin Snyder of the American Association of University Professors said Hoppe&#x27;s words will disturb &quot;[t]hose with a better memory than Hoppe for segregation, apartheid, internment facilities and concentration camps, for yellow stars and pink triangles&quot;. Walter Block describes Hoppe as calling for homosexuals and others to be banned from polite society, and says of Hoppe&#x27;s statement: &quot;it is stark, it is well written, it is radical...it is still exceedingly difficult to reconcile with libertarianism.&quot;

=== Support for immigration restrictions ===
Although a self-described anarcho-capitalist who favors abolishing the nation-state, Hoppe also garners controversy due to his support for governmental enforcement of immigration laws, which critics argue is at odds with libertarianism and anarcho-capitalism. Hoppe argues that as long as states exist, they should impose some restrictions on immigration. He has equated free immigration to &quot;forced integration&quot; which violates the rights of native peoples, since if land were privately owned, immigration would not be unhindered but would only occur with the consent of private property owners.

Hoppe&#x27;s Mises Institute colleague Walter Block has characterized Hoppe as an &quot;anti-open immigration activist&quot; who argues that, though all public property is &quot;stolen&quot; by the state from taxpayers, &quot;the state compounds the injustice when it allows immigrants to use [public] property, thus further &quot;invading&quot; the private property rights of the original owners&quot;. However, Block rejects Hoppe&#x27;s views as incompatible with libertarianism. He argues that Hoppe&#x27;s logic implies that flagrantly unlibertarian laws such as regulations on prostitution and drug use &quot;could be defended on the basis that many tax-paying property owners would not want such behavior on their own private property&quot;. Another libertarian author, Simon Guenzl, writing for &quot;Libertarian Papers,&quot; argues that: &quot;supporting a legitimate role for the state as an immigration gatekeeper is inconsistent with Rothbardian and Hoppean libertarian anarchism, as well as with the associated strategy of advocating always and in every instance reductions in the state&#x27;s role in society.&quot;

In terms of specific immigration restrictions, Hoppe argued that an appropriate policy will require immigrants to the United States to display proficiency in English in addition to &quot;superior (above-average) intellectual performance and character structure as well as a compatible system of values&quot;. He suggested that these criteria would lead to a &quot;systematic pro-European immigration bias&quot;. Jacob Hornberger of the &quot;Future of Freedom Foundation&quot; argued that the immigration test Hoppe advocated would probably be prejudiced against Latin American immigrants to the United States.

== Remarks about homosexuals and academic investigation ==
Hoppe&#x27;s statements and ideas concerning race and homosexuality have repeatedly provoked controversy among his libertarian peers and his colleagues at UNLV. Following a 4 March 2004, lecture on time preference at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), a student complained that Hoppe created a hostile classroom environment by asserting that homosexuals tend to be more shortsighted than heterosexuals in their ability to save money and plan economically, in part because they tend not to have children. Hoppe also suggested that John Maynard Keynes&#x27;s homosexuality might explain his economic views, with which Hoppe disagreed. Hoppe also stated that very young and very old people, and couples without children, were less likely to plan for the future. Hoppe told a reporter that the comments lasted only 90 seconds of a 75-minute class, no students questioned the comments, and that in 18 years of giving the lecture he had not received a complaint about them. At the request of university officials, Hoppe apologized to the class. He said, &quot;Italians tend to eat more spaghetti than Germans, and Germans tend to eat more sauerkraut than Italians&quot; and said that he was speaking in generalities. Thereafter, Hoppe told the reporter, the student alleged that Hoppe did not take the complaint seriously and filed a formal complaint. Hoppe told the reporter that he felt as if he was the victim in the incident and that the student should have been told to &quot;grow up&quot;.

An investigation was conducted, and the university&#x27;s provost, Raymond W. Alden III, issued Hoppe a non-disciplinary letter of instruction on 9 February 2005, with a finding that he had &quot;created a hostile or intimidating educational environment in violation of the University&#x27;s policies regarding discrimination as to sexual orientation&quot;. Alden also instructed Hoppe to &quot;... cease mischaracterizing opinion as objective fact&quot; and said that Hoppe&#x27;s opinion was not supported by peer-reviewed academic literature.

Hoppe appealed the decision, saying the university had &quot;blatantly violated its contractual obligations&quot; toward him, and described the action as &quot;frivolous interference with my right to academic freedom&quot;. He was represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, which threatened legal action. The Nevada ACLU executive director said, &quot;We don&#x27;t subscribe to Hans&#x27; theories and certainly understand why some students find them offensive ... But academic freedom means nothing if it doesn&#x27;t protect the right of professors to present scholarly ideas that are relevant to their curricula&quot;. Alden&#x27;s decision was picked up by Fox News and several blogs and libertarians organized a campaign to contact the university. The university received two weeks of bad publicity and the Interim Chancellor (Nevada System of Higher Education) Jim Rogers expressed concerns about &quot;any attempts to thwart free speech&quot;.

Jim Rogers rejected Hoppe&#x27;s request for a one-year paid sabbatical. UNLV President Carol Harter acted upon Hoppe&#x27;s appeal on 18 February 2005, deciding that Hoppe&#x27;s views, even if non-mainstream or controversial, should not be cause for reprimanding him. She dismissed the discrimination complaint against Hoppe, and the non-disciplinary letter was withdrawn from Hoppe&#x27;s personnel file. She wrote, &quot;In the balance between freedoms and responsibilities, and where there may be ambiguity between the two, academic freedom must, in the end, be foremost.&quot;

Hoppe later wrote about the incident and the UNLV investigation in an article entitled &quot;My Battle With the Thought Police&quot;. Martin Snyder of the American Association of University Professors wrote that he should not be &quot;punished for freely expressing his opinions&quot;.

Various controversies about academic freedom, including the Hoppe matter and remarks made by Harvard University President Lawrence Summers, prompted the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, to hold a conference on academic freedom in October 2005. In 2009 UNLV proposed a new policy that included the encouragement of reporting by people who felt that they had encountered bias. The proposed policy was criticized by the Nevada ACLU and some faculty members who remembered the Hoppe incident as adverse to academic freedom.

==Argumentation ethics==

In the September 1988 issue of &quot;Liberty&quot;, Hoppe attempted to establish an &quot;a priori&quot; and value-neutral justification for libertarian ethics by devising a new theory which he named &quot;argumentation ethics&quot;. Hoppe asserted that any argument which in any respect purports to contradict libertarian principles is logically incoherent.

Hoppe argued that, in the course of having an argument about politics (or indeed any subject), people assume certain norms of argumentation, including a prohibition on initiating violence. Hoppe then extrapolated this argument to political life in general, arguing that the norms governing argumentation should apply in all political contexts. Hoppe claimed that, of all political philosophies, only anarcho-capitalist libertarianism prohibits the initiation of aggressive violence (the non-aggression principle); therefore, any argument for any political philosophy other than anarcho-capitalist libertarianism is logically incoherent.

In the following issue, &quot;Liberty&quot; published comments by ten libertarians, followed by a rejoinder from Hoppe. In his comment for &quot;Liberty&quot;, Hoppe&#x27;s friend and Mises Institute supervisor Murray Rothbard wrote that Hoppe&#x27;s theory was &quot;a dazzling breakthrough for political philosophy in general and for libertarianism in particular&quot; and that Hoppe &quot;has managed to transcend the famous is/ought, fact/value dichotomy that has plagued philosophy since the days of the Scholastics, and that had brought modern libertarianism into a tiresome deadlock&quot;. However, the majority of Hoppe&#x27;s colleagues surveyed by &quot;Liberty&quot; rejected his theory. In his response, Hoppe derided his critics as &quot;utilitarians&quot;.

Mises Institute Senior Fellow Roderick T. Long stated that Hoppe&#x27;s &quot;a priori&quot; formulation of libertarianism denied the fundamental principle of Misesean praxeology. On the issue of utilitarianism, Long wrote, &quot;Hoppe&#x27;s argument, if it worked, would commit us to recognizing and respecting libertarian rights regardless of what our goals are – but as a praxeologist, I have trouble seeing how any practical requirement can be justified apart from a means-end structure.&quot; Libertarian philosopher Jason Brennan rejected Hoppe&#x27;s argument, saying, &quot;Hoppe&#x27;s argument illicitly conflates a liberty right with a claim right, and so fails.&quot;

Another critic argued that Hoppe had not provided any non-circular reasons why we &quot;have to regard moral values as something that &quot;must&quot; be regarded as being established through (consensual) argument instead of &#x27;mere&#x27; subjective preferences for situations turning out in certain ways&quot;. In other words, the theory relies &quot;on the existence [of] certain intuitions, the acceptance of which cannot itself be the result of &#x27;value-free&#x27; reasoning.&quot;

== Influence ==
Hoppe was an influence on the neoreactionary monarchist blogger Curtis Yarvin, also known as Mencius Moldbug.

Javier Milei, the president of Argentina, has cited Hoppe as one of his major influences and has recommended his bibliography in the past, despite recent grievances between both about the ideologic purity of Milei&#x27;s administration and the praxis for a libertarian on a democratic system.

== Personal life ==
Hoppe resides in Turkey with his wife Gülçin Imre Hoppe, an Austrian school economist and hotelier.

<text>The Yakovlev Yak-40 (; NATO reporting name: Codling) is a regional jet designed by Yakovlev. The trijet&#x27;s maiden flight was in 1966, and it was in production from 1967 to 1981. It was introduced to service in 1968, with export models following in 1970.

==Development==
By the early 1960s, Soviet international and internal trunk routes were served by Aeroflot, the state airline, using jet or turboprop powered airliners, but their local services, many of which operated from grass airfields, were served by obsolete piston-engine aircraft such as the Ilyushin Il-12, Il-14 and Lisunov Li-2. Aeroflot wanted to replace these elderly airliners with a turbine-powered aircraft, with the Yakovlev design bureau being assigned to design it. High speed was not required, but it would have to be able to operate safely and reliably out of poorly equipped airports with short (less than 700 m or 2,300 ft) unpaved runways in poor weather.

Yakovlev studied both turboprop and jet-powered designs to meet the requirement, including Vertical Take-Off and Landing designs with lift jets in the fuselage or in wing-mounted pods, but eventually they settled on a straight-winged tri-jet carrying 20 to 25 passengers. The engines were to be the new AI-25 turbofan being developed by Ivchenko at Zaporozhye in Ukraine.

==Design==


The Yak-40 is a low-winged cantilever monoplane with unswept wings, a large T-tail and a retractable tricycle landing gear. The passenger cabin is ahead of the wing, with the short rear fuselage carrying the three turbofan engines, with two engines mounted on short pylons on the side of the fuselage and a third engine in the rear fuselage, with air fed from a dorsal air-intake by an &quot;S-duct&quot;, as is an auxiliary power unit, fitted to allow engine start-up without ground support on primitive airfields. The three AI-25 engines are two-shaft engines rated at 14.7 kN (3,300 lbf). The engines have no jetpipes, and initially no thrust reversers.

The pressurized fuselage has a diameter of 2.4 metres (94 in). Pilot and co-pilot sit side by side in the aircraft&#x27;s flight deck, while the passenger cabin has a standard layout seating 24 to 27 passengers three-abreast, although 32 passengers can be carried by switching to four-abreast seating. Passengers enter the aircraft via a set of ventral airstairs in the rear fuselage.

The wing is fitted with large trailing-edge slotted flaps, but has no other high-lift devices, relying on the aircraft&#x27;s low wing loading to give the required short-field take-off and landing performance. The wings join at the aircraft centerline, with the main spar running from wingtip to wingtip. The wings house integral fuel tanks with a capacity of 3,800 litres (1,000 US gal; 840 imp gal). The aircraft has a large fin, which is swept back at an angle of 50 degrees to move the tailplane rearwards to compensate for the short rear fuselage. The horizontal tailplane itself is unswept.

The Yak-40 was the first Soviet-built airliner designed to Western airworthiness requirements.

==Operational history==
The first of five prototypes made its maiden flight on 21 October 1966, with production being launched at the Saratov Aviation Plant in 1967 and Soviet type certification granted in 1968. The type carried out its first passenger service for Aeroflot on 30 September 1968. In 1970, the type would experience its first fatal accident and hull loss with the crash of Aeroflot Flight Sh-4. In the 1972 version, a tailspin was removed. In 1974, new version was introduced, with non-stop flight distance increased. Also, the forward door on the right side of the fuselage changed its place – it was located together with the sixth window.

In 1975, the last upgrade of Yak-40 took place – the number of cabin windows on the right side changed from nine to eight.

By the time production ended in November 1981, the factory at Saratov had produced 1,011 or 1,013 aircraft. By 1993 Yak-40s operated by Aeroflot had carried 354 million passengers. As well as being the backbone of Aeroflot&#x27;s local operations, flying to 276 domestic destinations in 1980, the Yak-40 was also an export success. In addition to this, Yak-40 became the first Russian/Soviet aircraft to get flying certificates from Italy and West Germany. It was demonstrated in 75 countries of the world, including the US, where orders for the Yak-40 were made.

A total of 130 were exported to Afghanistan, Angola, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Germany, Guatemala, Honduras, Hungary, Italy, Laos, Madagascar, Philippines, Poland, Syria, Vietnam, Yugoslavia and Zambia.

As of July 2021, a Yak-40 has begun testing with an electric propeller engine in the nose of the aircraft.

==Operators==
===Civilian operators===

As of July 2019, a total of 22 out of 1011 Yakovlev Yak-40 aircraft remained in service with civil operators. The airworthiness of several Yak-40 of smaller Russian and Central Asian charter airlines is uncertain, as is the whereabouts of one Air Libya Tibesti aircraft after the civil war. Most aircraft in service today have been reconfigured for VIP-charter services, with fewer than ten remaining in scheduled passenger service. Known operators are:
===Military operators===
As of November 2012 no more than 17 Yak-40 remain in military service (possibly fewer, with the unclear situation in Syria). Known operators are:

<text>The Ludwig von Mises Institute for Austrian Economics, or Mises Institute, is a nonprofit think tank headquartered in Auburn, Alabama, that is a center for Austrian economics, right-wing libertarian thought and the paleolibertarian and anarcho-capitalist movements in the United States. It is named after the economist Ludwig von Mises (1881–1973) and promotes the Misesian version of heterodox Austrian economics.

It was founded in 1982 by Lew Rockwell, chief of staff to Texas Republican Congressman Ron Paul. Early supporters of the institute included economist F. A. Hayek, writer Henry Hazlitt, economist Murray Rothbard, Ron Paul, and libertarian coin dealer Burt Blumert.

==History==
The Mises Institute was founded in 1982 by Lew Rockwell, who was chief of staff to Texas Republican Congressman Ron Paul; previously Rockwell had been editor for the conservative Arlington House Publishers and had worked for the radical-right John Birch Society and the traditionalist Hillsdale College. Rockwell received the blessing of Margit von Mises during a meeting at the Russian Tea Room in New York City, and she was named the first chairman of the board. According to Rockwell, the institute was meant to promote the contributions of Ludwig von Mises, who he feared was being ignored by libertarian institutions financed by Charles Koch and David Koch. As recounted by Justin Raimondo, Rockwell said he received a phone call from George Pearson, of the Koch Foundation, who had said that Mises was too radical to name an organization after or promote.

The original academic vice president of the Mises Institute was Murray Rothbard, an influential right-wing libertarian activist and writer who had studied under Ludwig von Mises; Rothbard was a leading figure in the development of anarcho-capitalism and had also been a Cato Institute co-founder. Ron Paul, the Texas Republican congressman who would later run for president of the United States, was named a distinguished counselor and assisted with early fundraising. A timber company owner also contributed funds.

Judge John V. Denson assisted in the Mises Institute becoming established at the campus of Auburn University. Auburn was already home to some Austrian economists, including Roger Garrison. The Mises Institute was affiliated with the Auburn University Business School until 1998 when the institute established its own building across the street from campus.

The Mises Institute aligned itself with what Rothbard called the Old Right, with &quot;a defense of the gold standard, military isolationism, and &#x27;traditional morality&#x27; and opposition to fiat money, supranational institutions, and &#x27;forced integration&#x27;&quot;, according to academics Niklas Olsen and Quinn Slobodian. It started the &quot;Review of Austrian Economics&quot; in 1986.

Rothbard and Rockwell coined the name &quot;paleolibertarians&quot; for socially right-wing libertarians like themselves. They forged a &quot;paleo alliance&quot; between paleolibertarians and paleoconservatives in the form of the John Randolph Club in 1989, which allied the Mises Institute and the paleoconservative Rockford Institute. In the early 1990s, Austrian economist Steven Horwitz called the Mises Institute &quot;a fascist fist in a libertarian glove.&quot;

Figures at the Mises Institute were associated with neo-Confederate positions, and the institute held conferences about secession, including one in 1995 in Charleston, South Carolina, where the American Civil War had begun. After Rothbard&#x27;s death in 1996, his protege Hans-Hermann Hoppe became a leading anarcho-capitalist figure of the institute and is known for his anti-democratic writing.

In a 2000 report, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) said that the Mises Institute had shown &quot;recent interest in neo-Confederate themes&quot; and that Rockwell, the institute&#x27;s founder, had &quot;argued that the Civil War &#x27;transformed the American regime from a federalist system based on freedom to a centralized state that circumscribed liberty in the name of public order.&#x27;&quot;

Kyle Wingfield wrote a 2006 commentary in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; that the Southern United States was a &quot;natural home&quot; for the institute, as &quot;Southerners have always been distrustful of government,&quot; with the institute making the &quot;Heart of Dixie a wellspring of sensible economic thinking.&quot;

By 2011, &quot;The Economist&quot; said, the Austrian School economics championed by the Mises Institute had &quot;won few mainstream converts&quot;. But it noted the think tank&#x27;s growing presence on the internet as well as its facilities in Auburn including an amphitheater, conservatory, recording studio and library.

The political scientist George Hawley described the Mises Institute in 2016 as &quot;the intellectual epicenter of the radical libertarian movement in the United States&quot;. As of 2022, about 30 Mises Institutes had been created worldwide; some had died off but others, especially Brazil&#x27;s, had gained influence.

== Current activities ==

The institute describes its mission as to &quot;promote teaching and research in the Austrian school of economics, and individual freedom, honest history, and international peace, in the tradition of Ludwig von Mises and Murray N. Rothbard.&quot;

Its academic programs include Mises University (non-accredited), Rothbard Graduate Seminar, the Austrian Economics Research Conference, and a summer research fellowship program. In 2020, the Mises Institute began offering a graduate program. It publishes the &quot;Journal of Libertarian Studies,&quot; which it took over in 2000 from the Center for Libertarian Studies.

The German Mises Institute (Ludwig von Mises Institut Deutschland e.V.) is a 2012 founded interest group and think tank of libertarian gold traders and investment advisors, which were associated with Swiss-based German billionaire August von Finck (1930–2021). Many gold dealers from the von Finck company Degussa Goldhandel are active on the board of the institute; they reject intergovernmental fiscal policy and promote gold as a &quot;safe currency&quot;. Von Finck was active in economic policy and criticized the EU. He assumed the costs for expert opinions from prominent professors, such as Hans-Werner Sinn, with whose help the lawyer and politician Peter Gauweiler (CSU) took action at the German Federal Constitutional Court against the rescue packages for Greece and the Euro.

==Political and economic views==
The Mises Institute describes itself as libertarian, and as promoting the Austrian School of economics. In 2003, Chip Berlet of the SPLC described it as &quot;a major center promoting libertarian political theory and the Austrian School of free market economics&quot;, while also assessing that it favors a &quot;Darwinian view of society in which elites are seen as natural and any intervention by the government on behalf of social justice is destructive&quot;.

The Mises Institute favors the methodology of Misesian praxeology (&quot;the logic of human action&quot;), which holds that economic science is deductive rather than empirical. Developed by Ludwig von Mises, following the &quot;Methodenstreit&quot; opined by Carl Menger, it opposes the mathematical modeling and hypothesis-testing used to justify knowledge in neoclassical economics. Misesian economics is a form of heterodox economics. It is distinct from that of other Austrian economists, including Hayek and those associated with George Mason University.

== Influence on campaigns and government ==
The paleolibertarian economic and cultural views of some of the Mises Institute&#x27;s leading figures have been influential in the presidential campaigns of Ron Paul, the presidential campaign of Rand Paul, the presidential campaigns of Donald Trump, and the candidacy of Joshua Smith for chair of the Libertarian Party.

A 2014 &quot;New York Times&quot; piece described the Mises Institute as part of Rand Paul&#x27;s intellectual inheritance.

Candice Jackson, who served as acting head of the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights during the Trump Administration, was previously a summer fellow at the Mises Institute and had collaborated on articles for Rockwell&#x27;s website.

<text>Nils Jönsson Oxenstierna (1390s–1450s) was a Swedish nobleman. During the Kalmar Union, he was co-regent of Sweden, together with his brother Bengt Jönsson Oxenstierna (1390s–1450s) from January to June 1448. He was a member of the Privy Council of Sweden in 1432, Castellan &quot;(hövitsman)&quot; at Borgholm Castle in 1436, Stäket in 1438, and Nyköping Castle in 1442. Dubbed as knight by King Christopher of Bavaria following his coronation in 1441.

==Biography==
Oxenstierna was son of important nobles and landowners: his mother Märta Finvidsdotter (Frössviksätten) was the heiress of the noble Frössvik family, and his father Jöns Bengtsson Oxenstierna (died 1396–99) was the son and one of the heirs of Ingeborg Nilsdotter (from family that is called the earliest Sparre in later historiography and genealogy), heiress of Ängsö and Salsta. Jöns Bengtsson inherited Frössvik (in Uppland) from his mother and Ängsö (in Västmanland) from his father. His brother, Bengt Jönsson Oxenstierna, was the father of Jöns Bengtsson (Oxenstierna), Archbishop of Uppsala (1417–1467).

In 1418 he acquired an islet and the founded the estate Djursholm. There he built a manor house, later the site of Djursholm Castle (&quot;Djursholms slott&quot;) which dates from the 15th century but did not get its current appearance until the 17th century.

From his two earlier marriages, Oxenstierna did not succeed to have any surviving male heir. His third wife Katarina Karlsdotter bore a number of children of whom half died without marriage and issue. His surviving son Erik Nilsson Oxenstierna (d. 1470) did not have any children.

Three of Oxenstierna&#x27;s daughters married noblemen of the Vasa family. Kerstin who married Nils of Hjulsta, continues a more permanent issue. A portion of Oxenstierna&#x27;s properties passed ultimately to others than his direct descendants, as inheritances through his daughters-in- and sons-in-law.

<doc id="229903" wikidata="Q5762468" url="?curid=229903" title="Hill v Church of Scientology of Toronto">
<text>Hill v Church of Scientology of Toronto February 20, 1995 – July 20, 1995. 2 S.C.R. 1130 was a libel case against the Church of Scientology, in which the Supreme Court of Canada interpreted Ontario&#x27;s libel law in relation to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

After consideration, the Supreme Court of Canada determined that it would not follow the actual malice standard set forth in the famous United States Supreme Court case of &quot;New York Times Co. v. Sullivan&quot;, 376 U.S. 254 (1964).

==Overview==
On 17 September 1984, Morris Manning, a lawyer working for the Church, and representatives of the Church of Scientology held a press conference on the courthouse steps in Toronto. Manning, wearing his barrister&#x27;s gown, read from and commented upon allegations in a notice of motion by Scientology, intending to commence criminal contempt proceedings against a Crown counsel, Casey Hill. The motion alleged Hill had misled a judge and had breached orders sealing certain documents belonging to Scientology in &quot;R v Church of Scientology of Toronto&quot;.

At the contempt proceeding where the appellants were seeking a fine or imprisonment against the defendant, the allegations against Hill were found to be completely untrue and without foundation. Thus Hill launched a lawsuit for damages in libel against the appellants. Both appellants were found jointly liable for general damages of C$300,000 and Scientology alone was liable for aggravated damages of C$500,000 and punitive damages of C$800,000. The judgment was affirmed in a 1993 decision by the Court of Appeal for Ontario. The major issues raised in this appeal were: whether the common law of defamation was valid in light of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; and whether the jury&#x27;s award of damages could stand.

According to the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot;, &quot;Scientology paid Hill more than $4-million in 1996. The payment included interest and attorneys fees.&quot;

==The Charter, interpreting the common law and freedom of expression==

===Appellant&#x27;s arguments===
The Church of Scientology contended that the common law of defamation in Canada failed to evolve with Canadian society. Too much emphasis in the common law had been placed on the need to protect the reputation of plaintiffs at the expense of freedom of expression. This, they argued, was an unwarranted restriction imposed in a manner that cannot be justified in &quot;a free and democratic society&quot; that could survive a limitations clause challenge. The appellants added that if the element of government action was insufficient to attract &quot;Charter&quot; scrutiny, the principles of the common law ought to be interpreted, even in a purely private law action, in a manner consistent with the &quot;Charter&quot;. This, they argued, could be achieved only by the adoption of the &quot;actual malice&quot; standard of liability found in the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of &quot;New York Times Co. v. Sullivan.&quot;

Qualified privilege attaches to the occasion upon which the communication is made, and not to the communication itself. The legal effect of the defence of qualified privilege is to rebut the inference, which normally arises from the publication of defamatory words, that they were spoken with malice. Where the occasion is shown to be privileged, the &quot;bona fides&quot; of the defendant is presumed and the defendant is free to publish, with impunity, remarks which may be defamatory and untrue about the plaintiff. The privilege is not absolute, however, and can be defeated if the dominant motive for publishing the statement is actual or express malice. (Malice, in this context, is established by showing the defendant spoke dishonestly, or in knowing or reckless disregard for the truth.) Qualified privilege may also be defeated when the limits of the duty or interest have been exceeded. The fact that an occasion is privileged does not necessarily protect all that is said or written on that occasion. The information communicated must be reasonably appropriate in the context of the circumstances existing on the occasion when that information was given.

===The Court&#x27;s reasons===
In two opinions (a majority opinion written by Cory J. per La Forest, Gonthier, Cory, McLachlin, Iacobucci and Major JJ., and a concurrence in result by L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé J.), the Court rejected those arguments while continuing to apply &quot;RWDSU v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd.&quot;, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 573, that the Charter cannot rewrite the common law, though the common law should be interpreted according to general Charter principles. This did not mean the Court had to adopt the &quot;actual malice&quot; standard of libel from American jurisprudence.

In refusing to change Canadian law and bringing it more into line with &quot;actual malice&quot; standard applied in the US law (following the &quot;New York Times Co. v. Sullivan&quot; case) &quot;Cory J.&quot;, writing for the majority, stated (at ¶ 138):

:Freedom of speech, like any other freedom, is subject to the law and must be balanced against the essential need of the individuals to protect their reputation. The words of Diplock J. in &quot;Silkin v. Beaverbrook Newspapers Ltd.&quot;, [1958] 1 W.L.R. 743, at pp. 745-46, are worth repeating:

::&quot;Freedom of speech, like the other fundamental freedoms, is freedom under the law, and over the years the law has maintained a balance between, on the one hand, the right of the individual… whether he is in public life or not, to his unsullied reputation if he deserves it, and on the other hand… the right of the public… to express their views honestly and fearlessly on matters of public interest, even though that involves strong criticism of the conduct of public people.&quot;

In L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé&#x27;s concurring reasons, her analysis of the Charter issue applying to common law is succinctly stated: (at ¶ 206):

:First, however, in order to dispel any possible confusion regarding the applicability of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to the common law, I note that this issue can be easily summarized in the following two principles, both of which were first articulated by McIntyre J. in &quot;RWDSU v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd.&quot;, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 573:

::# The Charter does not directly apply to the common law unless it is the basis of some governmental action.
::# Even though the Charter does not directly apply to the common law absent government action, the common law must nonetheless be developed in accordance with Charter values. (To the same effect, see &quot;R. v. Salituro&quot;, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 654, &quot;Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp.&quot;, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 835, and &quot;R. v. Park&quot;, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 836, per L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé J.)

:In other words, the basic rule is that absent government action, the Charter applies only indirectly to the common law.

=== Factual background ===
As in all actions for libel, the factual background is extremely important and must be set out in some detail. At the time the defamatory statement were made, Casey Hill was employed as counsel with the Crown Law Office, Criminal Division of the Ministry of the Attorney General for the Province of Ontario. He had given advice to the Ontario Provincial Police (&quot;OPP&quot;) regarding a warrant obtained on March 1, 1983, which authorized a searched warrant on March 3 and 4, 1983, approximately 250,000 documents, comprising over 2 million pages of material, were seized. These documents were stored in some 900 boxes at an OPP building in Toronto.

===Result===
The Supreme Court upholds the Ontario Court of Appeal decision and the underlying jury award of general, aggravated and punitive damages.

==Largest libel award in Canada==
The jury award that was upheld in this appeal was the largest libel award in Canadian history. Barrister Manning and the Church of Scientology were found jointly liable for general damages of C$300,000. Scientology alone was liable for aggravated damages of C$500,000 and punitive damages of $800,000, making Scientology&#x27;s total liability C$1,600,000. It was not until 2008 that this record was broken.

<text>In Silkin v. Beaverbrook Newspapers Ltd., [1958] 1 W.L.R. 743, a House of Lords case, the famous speech of Lord Diplock states succinctly the principle that freedom of speech is subject to the law and like any other freedom there is a balancing. In freedom of speech this right must be balanced against the essential need of the individuals to protect their reputation.

Lord Diplock stated (at pp. 745–46):

:&quot;Freedom of speech, like the other fundamental freedoms, is freedom under the law, and over the years the law has maintained a balance between, on the one hand, the right of the individual . . . whether he is in public life or not, to his unsullied reputation if he deserves it, and on the other hand . . . the right of the public . . . to express their views honestly and fearlessly on matters of public interest, even though that involves strong criticism of the conduct of public people.&quot;</text><links>

<text>Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, Local 580 v Dolphin Delivery Ltd, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 573, is the seminal &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; decision that states that the Charter applies to governmental action, and to the common law except where matters are solely between private parties. Nevertheless, judges should interpret the common law in the light of the Charter.

== Background ==
The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union applied to the court to have Dolphin Delivery and Supercourier declared allies of Purolator, an employer of union members. This would have allowed the union to picket Dolphin while its employees would not have to cross the picket line.

The BC Labour Board declined to hear an application since the dispute was governed under the Canada Labour Code, as &quot;Purolator&quot; was an interprovincial company.

Dolphin obtained an injunction against secondary picketing on their premises on the basis that the common law does not permit secondary picketing.

The action was brought by the union on the basis that their rights to freedom of expression (section 2(b)) and freedom of association (section 2(d)) under the Charter were violated.

== Reasoning of the Court ==

McIntyre, writing for the court, looked at section 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982, which stated that any law inconsistent with the Charter is of no force or effect. The court stated that this should be interpreted broadly and thus must include both statute law and common law. However, this interpretation needed to be reconciled with section 32 which states that the Charter should apply only to Parliament and legislatures. The Court gave preference to section 32 and stated that the Charter will apply to common law only where the government is involved. 

The issue of whether the courts were included within the meaning of government was considered. The Court found that orders from the court did not constitute government action, rather the courts must be the neutral arbiters and cannot be included without unduly widening the scope of the Charter. The legislative, executive, and administrative branches, however, fall within the purview of government.

The final judgement of the court succinctly stated by McIntyre J.(at paras. 1 &amp; 2):

:&quot;1 The Charter does not directly apply to the common law unless it is the basis of some governmental action.&quot;
:&quot;2 Even though the Charter does not directly apply to the common law absent government action, the common law must nonetheless be developed in accordance with Charter values.&quot;

To the same effect, see Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto, (1995) 2 S.C.R. 1130, R. v. Salituro, (1991) 3 S.C.R. 654, Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp., (1994) 3 S.C.R. 835, and R. v. Park, (1995) 2 S.C.R. 836, per L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé J.

== Aftermath ==
Much of the principles from this case remain today, except for the opinion that court orders were exempted from Charter scrutiny. &quot;R. v. Rahey&quot;, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 58 reversed this and held that all courts are subject to the Charter.
