<text>The Hebrew University of Jerusalem (HUJI; ) is an Israeli public research university based in Jerusalem. Co-founded by Albert Einstein and Chaim Weizmann in July 1918, the public university officially opened on 1 April 1925. It is the second-oldest Israeli university, having been founded 30 years before the establishment of the State of Israel but six years after the older Technion university. The HUJI has three campuses in Jerusalem: one in Rehovot, one in Rishon LeZion and one in Eilat. Until 2023, the world&#x27;s largest library for Jewish studies—the National Library of Israel—was located on its Edmond J. Safra campus in the Givat Ram neighbourhood of Jerusalem.

The university has five affiliated teaching hospitals (including the Hadassah Medical Center), seven faculties, more than 100 research centers, and 315 academic departments. , one-third of all the doctoral candidates in Israel were studying at the HUJI.

Among its first board of governors was Sigmund Freud and Martin Buber. Four of Israel&#x27;s prime ministers are alumni of the university. , 15 Nobel Prize winners (8 alumni and teachers), two Fields Medalists (one alumnus), and three Turing Award winners have been affiliated with the HUJI. It is ranked as the 77th best university in the world.

==History==


A vision of the Zionist movement was the establishment of a Jewish university in the Land of Israel. Founding a university was proposed as far back as 1884 in the Kattowitz (Katowice) conference of the Hovevei Zion society, and by Hermann Schapira at the First Zionist Congress of 1897.

The cornerstone for the university was laid on 24 July 1918. Seven years later, on 1 April 1925, the Hebrew University campus on Mount Scopus was opened at a gala ceremony attended by the leaders of the Jewish world, distinguished scholars and public figures, and British dignitaries, including the Earl of Balfour, Viscount Allenby, Winston Churchill and Sir Herbert Samuel. The university&#x27;s first chancellor was Judah Magnes, who led the school as chancellor from 1924 to 1935. In 1935 to 1948 he led the school as president.

One of the most controversial issues during the conceptualization of the university regarded its future official language. Whereas one side, the so-called &quot;Germanists&quot;, proposed a combination of German and Arabic for all non-Jewish subjects, the other side opted for the general use of Hebrew. The former party was afraid the very recent Modern Hebrew might not yet allow high-level academic discussions since it still suffered from a lack of specific technical terms in non-religious contexts. Although this concern can not simply be dismissed as unreasonable, the representatives of this position underestimated the symbolic significance of Hebrew for many Jews, not least of all for those outside the academia. Therefore, they were not able to prevail in the discussion and had to give in to the decision that the new university would be an explicitly Hebrew one. The question, what would define the specific Hebrew character of the university did not only regard the choice of an official language but also organizational aspects, as for example the establishment of departments and the definition of their respective research areas, and the outline of its overall academic profile. Therefore, in 1919, Shmaryahu Levin inquired a number of prominent Jewish European scholars about their opinions on the subject. One of the respondents was Ignaz Goldziher whose proposals were at least partly implemented: oriental languages, Jewish literature, and archaeology were among the first subjects studied at the university.

By 1947, the university had become a large research and teaching institution. Sir Leon Simon was Acting President from 1948 to 1949, and he was succeeded as president by Professor Selig Brodetsky, who served from 1949 to 1952. Plans for a medical school were approved in May 1949, and in November 1949, a faculty of law was inaugurated. In 1952, it was announced that the agricultural institute founded by the university in 1940 would become a full-fledged faculty.

During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, attacks were carried out against convoys moving between the Israeli-controlled section of Jerusalem and the university. The leader of the Arab forces in Jerusalem, Abdul Kader Husseini, threatened military action against the university Hadassah Hospital &quot;if the Jews continued to use them as bases for attacks.&quot; After the April 1948 Hadassah medical convoy massacre, in which 79 Jews, including doctors and nurses, were killed, the Mount Scopus campus was cut off from Jerusalem. British soldier Jack Churchill coordinated the evacuation of 700 Jewish doctors, students and patients from the hospital.

When the Jordanian government denied Israeli access to Mount Scopus, a new campus was built at Givat Ram in western Jerusalem and completed in 1958. In the interim, classes were held in 40 different buildings around the city. Benjamin Mazar was President of the university from 1953 to 1961, Giulio Racah was Acting President from 1961 to 1962, and Eliahu Eilat was president from 1962 to 1968.

The Terra Santa building in Rehavia, rented from the Franciscan Custodians of the Latin Holy Places, was also used for this purpose. A few years later, together with the Hadassah Medical Organization, a medical science campus was built in the south-west Jerusalem neighborhood of Ein Kerem.

By the beginning of 1967, the students numbered 12,500, spread among the two campuses in Jerusalem and the agricultural faculty in Rehovot. After the unification of Jerusalem, following the Six-Day War of June 1967, the university was able to return to Mount Scopus, which was rebuilt. According to the Applied Research Institute–Jerusalem, Israel confiscated 568 Dunams of land from the Palestinian village of Isawiya for the Hebrew University in 1968. In 1981 the construction work was completed, and Mount Scopus again became the main campus of the university. Avraham Harman was President of the university from 1968 to 1983, Don Patinkin from 1983 to 1986, Amnon Pazy from 1986 to 1990, Yoram Ben-Porat from 1990 to 1992, Hanoch Gutfreund from 1992 to 1997, and Menachem Magidor from 1997 to 2009.

On 31 July 2002, a member of a terrorist cell detonated a bomb during lunch hour at the university&#x27;s &quot;Frank Sinatra&quot; cafeteria when it was crowded with staff and students. Nine people—five Israelis, three Americans, and one dual French-American citizen—were murdered and more than 70 wounded. World leaders, including Kofi Annan, President George W. Bush, and the EU&#x27;s High Representative Javier Solana issued statements of condemnation.

Menachem Ben-Sasson was President of the university from 2009 to 2017, succeeded by Asher Cohen in 2017.

In 2017 the Hebrew University of Jerusalem launched a marijuana research center, intended to &quot;conduct and coordinate research on cannabis and its biological effects with an eye toward commercial applications.&quot;

==Campuses==
===Mount Scopus===


Mount Scopus (Hebrew: Har HaTzofim הר הצופים), in the north-eastern part of Jerusalem, is home to the main campus, which contains the Faculties of Humanities, Social Sciences, Law, Jerusalem School of Business Administration, Seymour Fox School of Education, Baerwald School of Social Work, Harry S. Truman Research Institute for the Advancement of Peace, Rothberg International School, and the Mandel Institute of Jewish Studies.

The Rothberg International School features secular studies and Jewish/Israeli studies. Included for foreign students is also a mandatory Ulpan program for Hebrew language study which includes a mandatory course in Israeli culture and customs. All Rothberg Ulpan classes are taught by Israeli natives. However, many other classes at the Rothberg School are taught by Jewish immigrants to Israel.

The land on Mt. Scopus was purchased before World War I from Sir John Gray-Hill, along with the Gray-Hill mansion. The master plan for the university was designed by Patrick Geddes and his son-in-law, Frank Mears in December 1919. Only two buildings of this original scheme were built: the David Wolffsohn University and National Library, and the Mathematics Institute, with the Physics Institute probably being built to the designs of their Jerusalem-based partner, Benjamin Chaikin.

Housing for students at Hebrew University who live on Mount Scopus is located at the three dormitories located near the university. These are the Maiersdorf (מאירסדורף) dormitories, the Bronfman (ברונפמן) dormitories, and the Kfar HaStudentim (כפר הסטודנטים, Student Village).

Nearby is the Nicanor Cave, an ancient cave that was planned to be a national pantheon.

====Paul Baerwald School of Social Work and Social Welfare====
The first Bachelor of Social Work in Israel, the school was founded in 1958. The school was named after Paul Baerwald, a leader of the Jewish Distribution Committee (JDC). The JDC was an initial funder of the school along with the Ministry of Welfare and the Tel Aviv Municipality. A new self-standing building was dedicated on the Givat Ram university campus in April 1967. The school has been called &quot;the leader in training and research in the fields of social work and social policy.&quot; It has been ranked the highest rated school of social work in Israel. The Master of Social Work was introduced in 1970. The school houses the Israel Gerontological Data Center, Nevet- Greenhouse of Context-Informed Research and Training for Children in Need, The Center for the Study of Philanthropy in Israel, The Resilience Research Group.

===Jewish National and University Library===
The Jewish National and University Library is the central and largest library of the Hebrew University and one of the most impressive book and manuscript collections in the world. It is also the oldest section of the university. Founded in 1892 as a world center for the preservation of books relating to Jewish thought and culture, it assumed the additional functions of a general university library in 1920. Its collections of Hebraica and Judaica are the largest in the world. It houses all materials published in Israel, and attempts to acquire all materials published in the world related to the country. It possesses over five million books and thousands of items in special sections, many of which are unique. Among these are the Albert Einstein Archives, Hebrew manuscripts department, Eran Laor map collection, Edelstein science collection, Gershom Scholem collection, and a collection of Maimonides&#x27; manuscripts and early writings.

In his will, Albert Einstein left the Hebrew University his personal papers and the copyright to them. The Albert Einstein Archives contain some 55,000 items. In March 2012 the university announced that it had digitised the entire archive, and was planning to make it more accessible online. Included in the collection are his personal notes, love letters to various women, including the woman who would become his second wife, Elsa.

<doc id="229172" wikidata="Q900212" url="?curid=229172" title="Sailing at the 1900 Summer Olympics">
<text>Sailing/Yachting made its first appearance as an Olympic sport at the 1900 Summer Olympics after competitions were cancelled at the 1896 Olympics. With the exception of 1904, sailing was thereafter always a part of the Olympic program. The sailing program in 1900 consisted of a total of eight sailing classes. For six classes, the races were scheduled from 20 – 27 May at the river Seine around Meulan, and several series of three races were held for the largest classes from 1–5 August on the North Atlantic off the coast of Le Havre. Approximately 150 sailors in 64 boats (the numbers of boats and competitors are not reliable, as in the official report some figures of the World exhibition and the Olympic Games are mixed) from 6 nations competed, including 1 woman, Hélène de Pourtalès, who won a gold medal in the 1 to 2 ton.

== Venues ==
During the early years of the Olympic movement there were no strict rules for the assignment of venues. For the Olympic sailing in 1900 the organizers decided to combine the Olympic sailing for the smaller yachts with the regattas of the Exposition Universelle on the river Seine near Meulan. For the larger yachts an Olympic regatta was held at Le Havre.

=== Meulan ===
During the Olympic regattas of the Exposition Universelle of 1900 there were more than 100 yachts racing from Paris, Rouen, Cannes, Nantes and Arcachon and yachts from England, Germany, the United States and Holland. The Bassin Olympique was the river Seine near the Cercle de la Voile de Paris that served as the Olympic harbor.

The race conditions at Meulan during the Olympic regatta were not ideal. A light breeze could hardly make the sailing interesting. Since the river Seine mainly runs from east to west, the light north-easterly breeze was partly blocked by buildings or trees on the river bank, thus heavily influencing the regatta.

=== Le Havre ===
During the second part of the Olympic regatta the Atlantic Ocean was used for the races of the 10 – 20 ton and the 20+ ton yachts. The conditions during the regatta were so good that the 10 – 20 Ton class was able to sail the complete 22 nautical mile triangular course. The premises of the Société des Régates du Havre were used as Olympic harbor.
=== Course areas ===
Since there were two venues there were two course areas. One the river Seine near Meulan. Here the organization could set courses of . The other course area was on the North Atlantic off the coats of Le Havre. Here courses could be set up to .

== Participating nations ==
6 nations sent sailors. Several teams had crews from multiple countries, and in one case, they won a gold medal. This team, of the United Kingdom and France, is attributed as a mixed team.

== Classes (equipment) ==
Sailing during the turn of the century was not as well defined as it became later during the 20th century. Racing rules were mostly defined by local yacht clubs or in some cases by a National Yachting Federation. Also, boats were not standardized to what are now called &quot;One Design&quot; or &quot;One Builder&quot; classes. Therefore, many handicap systems or systems that put yachts into different categories were used. In 1892, Auguste Godinet developed a formula that placed different boats in different &quot;Ton&quot; categories. This rule was adopted by the Union des yachts français and later by several other National Yachting Federations such as the Société Nautique de Genève. For the sailing at the 1900 Olympics this rule was chosen to determine the tonnage of a yacht.

For the smallest class, 0 – ½ Ton, among others, Larks were used. These Larks, copies of the Davis &quot;Lark&quot; and of the &quot;Sorceress&quot; designed by Linton Hope, became famous One Designs in France (Monotype de Chatou at the beginning of the 20th century.

The Olympics were open for the following classes:
==Race schedule==

== Medal summary ==
The results of the individual races are known; however, in the past there has not been consensus on which races were considered &quot;Olympic&quot; and thus who the Olympic medalists were. The Official Report, International Olympic Committee (IOC), International Sailing Federation (ISAF) and Sports Reference present different medalists. The IOC has never decided which events were &quot;Olympic&quot; and which were not. Occasionally, sources differ on the nationality of competitors (such as H. MacHenry, alternately listed as French or American). For example, the medalists in the 3 – 10 Ton races are shown in the various sources as:

In all classes at Meulan except the Open class, there were two distinct &quot;finals.&quot; Boats were assigned time handicaps according to their weight within each class and prizes were handed out to the winners of each race. The IOC initially recognized the winner of the first race in each class as Olympic champion except in the case of the 10 – 20 ton class, which was decided on aggregate time over three races. However, currently the participants of both first and second races in three classes (0 – 0.5t, 1 – 2t and 2 – 3t) are present in the IOC database as medalists. That is, the second race in each of these three classes is recognized by the IOC and for each of these events two gold, two silver, and two bronze medals were retrospectively awarded by the IOC. In the 3 – 10 Ton race, however, only the second race winners are listed with Olympic medals.

The data below notes all races and medalists of the regattas of the Games of the second Olympiad, as well as of the Exposition Universelle and counts all winners as medalists, because the IOC website currently affirms a total of 95 medal events in the Games.

== Medal table ==
All races now considered official Olympic events, as IOC website affirms 95 total medal events.
== Notes ==
There was some discussion about the validity of the Olympic status of Sailing at the 1900 Summer Olympics. Ian Buchanan, first president of the International Society of Olympic Historians, stated, &quot;Given the possible awarding of cash prizes, the &quot;Olympic status&quot; of this sport in 1900 must be in question. It is not exactly certain if the prizes were cash or &quot;objets d’art&quot; of the values listed, thus, for now, I have retained yachting as an Olympic sport in 1900.&quot;

== Other information ==
During the sailing regattas at the 1900 Summer Olympics among others the following persons were competing (or owning yachts) in the various classes:
* Celebrities
** , Édouard Alphonse James de Rothschild
** , Hermann de Pourtalès

<doc id="229173" wikidata="Q203547" url="?curid=229173" title="Plecoptera">
<text>Plecoptera is an order of insects, commonly known as stoneflies. Some 3,500 species are described worldwide, with new species still being discovered. Stoneflies are found worldwide, except Antarctica. Stoneflies are believed to be one of the most primitive groups of Neoptera, with close relatives identified from the Carboniferous and Lower Permian geological periods, while true stoneflies are known from fossils only a bit younger. Their modern diversity, however, apparently is of Mesozoic origin.

Plecoptera are found in both the Southern and Northern Hemispheres, and the populations are quite distinct, although the evolutionary evidence suggests species may have crossed the equator on a number of occasions before once again becoming geographically isolated.

All species of Plecoptera are intolerant of water pollution, and the presence of their nymphs in a stream or still water is usually an indicator of good or excellent water quality. 

==Description and ecology==


Stoneflies have a generalized anatomy, with few specialized features compared to other insects. They have simple mouthparts with chewing mandibles, long, multiple-segmented antennae, large compound eyes, and two or three ocelli. The legs are robust, with each ending in two claws. The abdomen is relatively soft, and may include remnants of the nymphal gills even in the adult. Both nymphs and adults have long, paired cerci projecting from the tip of their abdomens.

The name &quot;Plecoptera&quot; literally means &quot;braided-wings&quot;, from the Ancient Greek &quot;plekein&quot; (πλέκειν, &quot;to braid&quot;) and &quot;pteryx&quot; (πτέρυξ, &quot;wing&quot;). This refers to the complex venation of their two pairs of wings, which are membranous and fold flat over their backs. Stoneflies are generally not strong fliers, and some species are entirely wingless.

A few wingless species, such as the Lake Tahoe benthic stonefly (&quot;&quot;Capnia&quot; lacustra&quot;) or &quot;Baikaloperla&quot;, are the only known insects, perhaps with the exception of &quot;Halobates&quot;, that are exclusively aquatic from birth to death. Some true water bugs (Nepomorpha) may also be fully aquatic for their entire lives, but can leave the water to travel.

The nymphs (technically, &quot;naiads&quot;) are aquatic and live in the benthic zone of well-oxygenated lakes and streams. A few species found in New Zealand and nearby islands have terrestrial nymphs, but even these inhabit only very moist environments. The nymphs physically resemble wingless adults, but often have external gills, which may be present on almost any part of the body. Nymphs can acquire oxygen via diffusing through the exoskeleton, or through gills located on behind the head, on the thorax, or around the anus. Due to their nymph&#x27;s requirement for well oxygenated water, the species is very sensitive to water pollution. This makes them important indicators for water quality. Most species are herbivorous as nymphs, feeding on submerged leaves and benthic algae, but many are hunters of other aquatic arthropods.
== Life cycle ==
The female can lay up to one thousand eggs. It will fly over the water and drop the eggs in the water. It also may hang on a rock or branch. Eggs are covered in a sticky coating which allows them to adhere to rocks without being swept away by swift currents. The eggs typically take two to three weeks to hatch, but some species undergo diapause, with the eggs remaining dormant throughout a dry season, and hatching only when conditions are suitable.

The insects remain in the nymphal form for one to four years, depending on species, and undergo from 12 to 36 molts before emerging and becoming terrestrial as adults. Before becoming adults, nymphs will leave the water, attach to a fixed surface and molt one last time.

The adults generally only survive for a few weeks, and emerge only during specific times of the year when resources are optimal. Some do not feed at all, but those that do are herbivorous. Adults are not strong fliers and generally stay near the stream or lake they hatched from.

==Phylogeny==

A summary of the phylogeny of stoneflies is shown below. While the Antarctoperlaria, Arctoperlaria, Euholognatha, Systellognatha are well supported, several further relationships are disputed. Some families have only been analyzed by one study (indicated by dashed lines) and their placement may change in the near future.

<text>Ranong ( . &quot;not to be confused with Rayong&quot;) is one of Thailand&#x27;s southern provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;), on the west coast along the Andaman Sea. It has the fewest inhabitants of all Thai provinces (making it the least populous of all the Thai provinces). Provinces neighboring Ranong are (clockwise) Chumphon, Surat Thani, and Phang Nga. To the west, it borders Kawthaung, Tanintharyi, Myanmar.

==Geography==
Ranong is on the Kra Isthmus, a narrow strip of land, only wide, that connects Thailand with the Malay Peninsula, on the west of the Phuket mountain range. It has a long coast on the Andaman Sea. The province, together with Trat province, is known for being one of the wettest places in Thailand, the rainy season lasting for about eight months.

Ranong is the least populated province. The total forest area is or 53.5 percent of provincial area, and 67 percent is mountainous. In former years the major industry was tin mining, but most mines are now exhausted. White clay mining (for the production of porcelain) and fishing are now the main industries, along with rubber and cashew nuts.

The Ngao Mangrove Forest Research Centre, also known as the Ranong Biosphere Reserve, in the north of Kapoe District, covering 189,431 rai (303.09 km2), was declared in 1997. It is the fourth biosphere reserve of Thailand, and the only one on the seacoast protecting mangrove forests.
===National parks===
There are four national parks, along with seven other national parks, make up region 4 (Surat Thani) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas. 
* Namtok Ngao National Park, 
* Mu Ko Ranong National Park, 
* Laem Son National Park, 
* Lam Nam Kra Buri National Park, 
===Wildlife sanctuaries===
* Khlong Nakha Wildlife Sanctuary, 
* Khuan Mae Yai Mon Wildlife Sanctuary, 
* Thung Raya–Na Sak Wildlife Sanctuary, 
* Prince Chumphon South Park Wildlife Sanctuary, 

==History==
Ranong province once was a deputy town of Chumphon in the Ayutthaya era (1350–1767). It was a small, mountainous town that protected Chumphon from Burma. The population was very low until the discovery of tin, when people from many cities and foreigners started to visit Ranong to do tin business there. This also gave rise to the name Ranong, which was a distorted form of &quot;rae nong&quot; (แร่นอง), meaning &quot;full of minerals&quot;. The ruler of Ranong was known after the town as &quot;Luang Ranong&quot; ()

At the start of the Rattanakosin era (1781–present), a wealthy Chinese merchant, Kho Su Jiang bought a majority share of the tin business in Ranong and was appointed tax collector of the region, with the title &quot;Luang Rattana Setti&quot; (), by King Nangklao (Rama III). In 1854, the &quot;Luang Ranong&quot; died. King Mongkut (Rama IV) then promoted Kho Su Jiang to the position, promoting him to &quot;Phra Rattana Setti&quot; (). By then, Ranong&#x27;s wealth had increased greatly and through taxation was a significant source of income for the capital, thus in 1877 King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) elevated Ranong to provincial status, answering directly to Bangkok as opposed to Chumphon, with Phra Rattana Setti becoming its first governor.

After the First Anglo-Burmese War, when the British assumed control of Tenasserim and the Kraburi River became the demarcation line between Siam and British-controlled Burma, Ranong became an important border city where goods were exchanged, a status that it still holds today.

Being located on the Kra Isthmus, the narrowest part (44 kilometres) of the Malay Peninsula, a proposal of a canal through the area has been long suggested, particularly by the French. If successful, traveling from Europe to China would be faster through this route instead of circumnavigating the Malay Peninsula. This was seen as a threat to the financial growth of the harbors of Singapore and Penang, which at the time were owned by Britain, who therefore forced the suspension of the project. At the end of World War II, Thailand signed a British-imposed treaty called &quot;The Termination of The State of War Between Siam and Allies&quot;, which forbade Thailand from digging such a canal without British permission. This treaty was revoked in 1954. Since then, plans for the canal have continued to be suggested and discussed, even in the present day, though Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said in 2018 that it was not a government priority.

Ranong has also been historically significant as a residence for royal tours of the southern provinces, with many kings of Thailand visiting Ranong in the past. The first was King Chulalongkorn, who stayed at Rattana Ransan palace for three nights in 1890. The palace is now a landmark in Ranong. King Prajadhipok (Rama VII) visited in 1928, and King Bhumibol (Rama IX) and Queen Sirikit visited in 1959.

==Climate==
Most of Thailand receives from 1,200 to 1,600 mm of precipitation per year. Two provinces, Ranong and Trat, receive more than 4,500 mm a year making them the wettest places in the country.

==Symbols==
The provincial seal shows a castle on top of a hill, as an aide memoire that King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) once visited Ranong and stayed at the Ratana Rangsan Castle on top of the Niveskiri Hill. The number five refers to King Rama V; the castle is Ratana Rangsan Palace; the mountain is Niveshkiri; the royal tray refers to the people of Ranong.

The provincial slogan is, &quot;Kra Isthmus, mountain grass, cashew nut, mineral water stream, and real pearl of Ranong.&quot;

The provincial tree is the Banaba (&quot;Lagerstroemia speciosa&quot;), and the provincial flower is the orchid &quot;Dendrobium formosum&quot;. The endemic terrestrial crab &quot;Phricotelphusa sirindhorn&quot; is the provincial aquatic life.

==Administrative divisions==
===Provincial government===

Ranong is divided into five districts (&quot;amphoe&quot;). These are further divided into 30 subdistricts (&quot;tambon&quot;) and 178 villages (&quot;muban&quot;). 
===Local government===
As of December 2023 there are: one Ranong provincial administrative organization - PAO (&quot;&quot;) and 12 municipal areas (&quot;thesaban&quot;) in the province. Ranong and Bang Rin have town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status. Further 10 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;).
The non-municipal areas are administered by 19 subdistrict administrative organisations - SAO (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

==Transportation==
Phet Kasem Road (Thailand Route 4) runs through the city. Ranong Airport is about south of town.

The Port Authority of Thailand operates the Ranong Port, which is Thailand&#x27;s principal Indian Ocean port. In 2008, the Ranong human-smuggling incident resulted in 54 deaths.

==Human achievement index 2022==

Since 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the Human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.


==Tourism==
Namtok Ngao National Park (อุทยานแห่งชาติน้ำตกหงาว) Covering a total area of approximately 417,500 rai (668 km2) it was declared a national park on 3 June 1999.

Ko Chang (Ranong) (เกาะช้าง) island in tambon Ko Phayam. With an area of 18 square kilometres and 80 homes on the entire island. Cashew and para rubber plantations as well as coastal fisheries are the main industries.

Laem Son National Park (อุทยานแห่งชาติแหลมสน) It covers a total area of 196,875 rai (31.5 hectares). It also includes islands in the Andaman Sea; namely, Ko Khangkhao and Mu Ko Kam. Places of interest within the national park include:

*Hat Bang Ben (หาดบางเบน) is a long sandy beach shaded by pine trees where the national park headquarters is located.
*Hat Laem Son (หาดแหลมสน) is a white sandy beach approximately four kilometres next to Hat Bang Ben.
*Hat Praphat or Hat Hin Thung (หาดประพาส หรือ หาดหินทุ่ง) Similar to Hat Bang Ben, Hat Praphat is a large beach shaded by pine trees.
*Ko Khangkhao (เกาะค้างคาว) is an island with fine sandy beaches and a gravel beach known as Hat Hin Ngam in the north.
*Ko Kam Yai (เกาะกำใหญ่) is a scenic island with white sandy beaches.
*Ko Kam Nui (เกาะกำนุ้ย) is not far from Ko Kam Yai with beaches on one side and many other nearby islets.

Raksawarin Hot Springs and Public Park (บ่อน้ำพุร้อนรักษะวาริน) The most famous and popular hot spring of Ranong. It have been analysed by the Department of Science Service to contain important minerals, and it is the only source in Thailand that does not contain any sulphur additives. It is possible to drink from the source, and it is also regarded as pure water. The hot springs and public park is in Ranong town.

Phu Khao Ya (ภูเขาหญ้า) The bald mountain with grass growing all over the mountain, it is extraordinary in that it is a geographical anomaly. This average-sized hill is entirely void of trees leaving it looking, as local residents say, like a &quot;Swiss pasture&quot;. Phu Khao Ya can also change color according to the season and time of day. It is situated 12 kilometres (7.4 mi) to the south of Ranong town.

Khlong Naka (คลองนาคา) This wildlife sanctuary is the only home for the aquatic plant &quot;Crinum thaianum&quot;. This species of plant is endemic to the local stream, and from October till November is when the flowers bloom at their most.

Wat Hat Som Paen (วัดหาดส้มแป้น) The local Ranong Buddhist temple. Its highlight, besides worshiping the Buddha, is also admiring the beauty of the stream that flows through the temple, which is also home to a large number of the rock mahseer.

<doc id="229175" wikidata="Q622206" url="?curid=229175" title="Apsley House">
<text>Apsley House is the London townhouse of the Dukes of Wellington. It stands alone at Hyde Park Corner, on the south-east corner of Hyde Park, facing towards the large traffic roundabout in the centre of which stands the Wellington Arch. It is a Grade I listed building.

Designed by Robert Adam in the neoclassical style, the house was built for Lord Apsley in the 1770s. It was purchased by Richard Wellesley, in 1807, and passed to his younger brother Arthur, the 1st duke, in 1817. It was sometimes referred to as Number One, London. It is perhaps the only preserved example of an English aristocratic townhouse from this period.

The house is also called the Wellington Museum, its official designation under the Wellington Museum Act 1947. Run by English Heritage, much of the house is open to the public as a museum and art gallery, exhibiting the Wellington Collection, a large collection of paintings, other artworks and memorabilia of the career of the 1st Duke. The 9th Duke of Wellington retains half the house for the family&#x27;s private use. The practice has been to maintain the public rooms as far as possible in the original style and decor of the 1st Duke.

==History==
Apsley House stands at the site of an old lodge that belonged to the crown. During the Interregnum newer buildings were erected between what is now Old Park Lane and Hyde Park Corner. In the 1600s after the Restoration they were leased by James Hamilton (died 1673) and renewed by Elizabeth his widow in 1692 on a 99-year lease (Hamilton Place takes its name from that family). Immediately before Apsley House was built the site was occupied by a tavern called the Hercules Pillars (immortalised by Henry Fielding in &quot;The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling&quot; as the location where Squire Western resides when he first journeys up to London).

The house was originally built in red brick by Robert Adam between 1771 and 1778 for Lord Apsley, the Lord Chancellor, who gave the house its name. Some Adam interiors survive: the Piccadilly Drawing Room with its apsidal end and Adam fireplace, and the Portico Room, behind the giant Corinthian portico added by Wellington.

The house was given the popular nickname of Number One, London, since it was the first house passed by visitors who travelled from the countryside after the toll gates at Knightsbridge. It was originally part of a contiguous line of great houses on Piccadilly, demolished to widen Park Lane: its official address remains 149 Piccadilly, W1J 7NT.

In 1807 the house was purchased by Richard Wellesley, the elder brother of the Arthur Wellesley, but in 1817 financial difficulties forced him to sell it to his famous brother, by then the Duke of Wellington, who needed a London base from which to pursue his new career in politics.

Wellington employed the architect Benjamin Dean Wyatt to carry out renovations in two phases: in the first, begun in 1819, he added a three-storey extension to the north east, housing a State Dining Room, bedrooms and dressing rooms. The scagliola ornamentations, that resemble marble inlays, were produced in Coade stone from the Coade Ornamental Stone Manufactory in Lambeth. 

The second phase, started after Wellington had become Prime Minister in 1828, included a new staircase and the &quot;Waterloo Gallery&quot; on the west side of the house. The red-brick exterior was clad in Bath stone, and a pedimented portico added. Wyatt&#x27;s original estimate for the work was £23,000, but the need to repair structural defects discovered during the work led to costs escalating to more than £61,000. Wyatt introduced his own version of French style to the interior, notably in the Waterloo Gallery and the florid wrought iron stair-rail, described by Pevsner as &quot;just turning from Empire to a neo-Rococo&quot;. Iron shutters and railings were also added to the house after the windows had been smashed during riots.

The Waterloo Gallery is named after the Duke&#x27;s famous victory over Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo. The Waterloo Banquet was held annually to commemorate the famous victory of 18 June 1815. The first banquets were held in the Dining Room but in 1828 when Wyatt completed the Waterloo Gallery the banquet was moved there and became a much larger event, seating 74 as opposed to 36 in the dining room. The Duke&#x27;s equestrian statue can be seen across the busy road, cloaked and watchful, the plinth guarded at each corner by an infantryman. This statue was cast from guns captured at the battle.

Gerald Wellesley, 7th Duke of Wellington, gave the house and its most important contents to the nation in 1947, but by the Wellington Museum Act 1947 (10 &amp; 11 Geo. 6. c. 46) the right of the family to occupy just over half the house was preserved &quot;so long as there is a Duke of Wellington&quot;. The house was refurbished by the Ministry of Works, with old gas lighting removed and replaced by electricity, and the house was opened as a museum in 1952 as part of the Victoria and Albert Museum. In 2004 responsibility for the house was transferred to English Heritage, against the wishes of the Wellington family.

The family apartments are now on the north side of the house, concentrated on the second floor.

<text>Robert Stirling (25 October 1790 – 6 June 1878) was a Scottish clergyman and engineer. He invented the Stirling engine and was inducted into the Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame in 2014.

== Early life ==

Robert Stirling was born at Cloag Farm, a location in Scotland near the village of Methven, Perthshire. A member of the Dublane side of the Stirling family, Robert was born to Patrick and Agnes Stirling. He was one of eight children that Patrick and Agnes shared. 

His grandfather was Michael Stirling, most famously known for his invention of the threshing machine. Robert&#x27;s father, Patrick, also spent time experimenting and innovating with industrial agricultural equipment.

Though Robert, like his father and grandfather, had a natural inclination for engineering, he began attending Edinburgh University in 1805 at the age of fifteen to study divinity in hopes of becoming a minister. His brother James, who would play a major role in Stirling&#x27;s future engineering endeavours, also attended Edinburgh at the age of 14. 

He finished his studies at University of Edinburgh and continued in November 1809 to study at Glasgow University where, according to Keith Laidler, he studied the classics, philosophy, theology and mathematics, but probably very little science. In 1814, he returned to Edinburgh University studying divinity for a final time.

Robert was licensed to preach in the Church of Scotland in 1816 by the Presbytery of Dumbarton. In September 1816, the commissioner of the Duke of Portland granted Stirling the title of Minister as the second charge for the Laigh Kirk parish in Kilmarnock. Finally, in February 1824, Stirling was appointed as the minister of nearby Galston Parish Church where he continued his ministry until 1878.

In July 1819, Robert Stirling married Jane Rankine. Together, they had seven children, five sons and two daughters.

=== History ===

Robert Stirling is considered as one of the fathers of hot air engines. Few before him ventured to build air engines, Guillaume Amontons being the first one to build a working hot air engine in 1699.

Amontons was followed in 1807 by George Cayley whose engine was of those in which the fire is enclosed, and fed by air pumped in beneath the grate in sufficient quantity to maintain combustion, while by far the largest portion of the air enters above the fire, to be heated and expanded; the whole, together with the products of combustion, then acts on the piston, and passes through the working cylinder; and the operation being one of simple mixture only, no heating surface of metal is required, the air to be heated being brought into immediate contact with the fire.

Stirling came up with a first patent for an air engine in 1816. The principle of the Stirling Air Engine differs from Cayley&#x27;s, in which the air is forced through the furnace and exhausted, whereas in Stirling&#x27;s engine the air works in a closed circuit. It was to it that the inventor devoted most of his attention. A two horse-power Stirling hot air engine, built in 1818 for pumping water at an Ayrshire quarry, continued to work for some time, until a careless attendant allowed the heater to become overheated. This experiment proved to the inventor that, owing to the low working pressure obtainable, the engine could only be adapted to small powers for which there was at that time no demand.

The Stirling 1816 patent was also about an &quot;Economiser&quot;, the predecessor of the regenerator. In this patent (# 4081) he describes the &quot;economiser&quot; technology and several applications where such technology can be used. Out of them came a new arrangement for a hot air engine. In 1818, one engine was built to pump water from a quarry in Ayrshire, but due to technical issues, the engine was abandoned for a time.

Stirling patented a second hot air engine, together with his brother James, in 1827. They inverted the design so that the hot ends of the displacers were underneath the machinery and they added a compressed air pump so the air within could be increased in pressure to around 20 atmospheres.

The two Stirling brothers were followed shortly after in 1828 by Parkinson &amp; Crossley and in 1829 and Arnott. These precursors, to whom John Ericsson should be added, have brought to the world the hot air engine technology and its enormous advantages over the steam engine. Each of them came with his own specific technology, and although the Stirling engine and the Parkinson &amp; Crossley engines were quite similar, Robert Stirling distinguished himself by inventing the regenerator, the first example of a Regenerative heat exchanger.

Parkinson and Crosley introduced the principle of using air of greater density than that of the atmosphere, and so obtained an engine of greater power in the same compass. James Stirling followed this same idea when he built the famous Dundee engine.

The Stirling patent of 1827 has been the base of the Stirling third patent of 1840. The changes against the 1827 patent were minor but essential. It was this third patent that gave the birth to the Dundee engine.

James Stirling gave a presentation of his engine before the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1845. The first engine of this kind which, after various modifications, was efficiently constructed and heated, had a cylinder of 12 inches (approx. 30 cm) in diameter, with a length of stroke of 2 feet (approx. 61 cm), and made 40 strokes or revolutions in a minute (40 rpm). This engine moved all the machinery at the Dundee Foundry Company&#x27;s works for eight or ten months, and was previously found capable of raising 700,000 lbs one foot in a minute (approx. 21 HP).

Finding this power insufficient for their works, the Dundee Foundry Company erected the second engine, with a cylinder of 16 inches (approx. 40 cm) in diameter, a stroke of 4 feet (approx. 1.20 m), and making 28 strokes in a minute. This engine has now been in continual operation for upwards of two years, and has not only performed the work of the foundry in the most satisfactory manner, but has been tested (by a friction brake on a third mover) to the extent of lifting nearly 1,500,000 lbs (approx. 45 HP).

This gives a consumption of 2.7 lbs. (approx. 1.22 kg) per horse-power per hour; but when the engine was not fully burdened, the consumption was considerably under 2.5 lbs. (approx. 1.13 kg) per horse-power per hour. This performance was at the level of the best steam engines whose efficiency was about 10%. After James Stirling, such efficiency was possible only thanks to the use of the economiser (or regenerator).

=== Hot air engine ===

Robert Stirling&#x27;s best known invention is the heat engine now referred to as the Stirling engine. In 1816 the Stirling brothers applied for a patent in both Scotland and England for a device they invented, a Heat Economiser. The function of this invention was to store and release heat as air circulated through its mechanisms. This differed from most heat engines which used steam as their method of storing and releasing energy.

While in Kilmarnock, he collaborated with another inventor, Thomas Morton, who provided workshop facilities for Stirling&#x27;s research. By 1818 Stirling had incorporated this Heat Economiser into a piston engine that created a closed cycle heat engine, which was powered by air, a contrast to the steam engines that were predominant at the time. This updated version of the heat engine was used to pump water from a quarry. Stirling&#x27;s heat engine was able to run well but was limited by the weaker metals available at the time. Due to the flimsiness of the materials used, the air vessels were eventually crushed by the high pressure of the heated air.

In 1824 Stirling sought to improve the efficiency of the heat engine by attempting to separate the air present in the economizer. This was done by making the plungers in the air engine from thin plates of metal. This was to improve airflow and offer better heating and cooling of the engine. Although this idea received a patent, it was ultimately unsuccessful in improving the heat engine&#x27;s overall efficiency.

In 1840 Stirling received another patent for the heat engine after altering the design in a new attempt to increase durability. The improvements added by Stirling included the addition of rods or plates in the passage through which hot air travelled to the cold section of the engine. By having these surfaces, the air was able to be cooled to a lower temperature when travelling from the hot section of the engine to the cold section of the engine. Additionally, Stirling added cupped leather collars around the piston rods to seal gaps and minimize the leakage of air from the engine. After developing these improvements, Stirling built two of these heat engines to use at an iron foundry he managed in Dundee. One of these air engines was started in March 1843 where it ran until December 1845 when an air vessel failed. The air vessel failure could be attributed to the metals being unable to withstand the high temperatures at which the engine was running. After replacing the air vessel a couple times, the air engine was dismantled in 1847 after Stirling left the Dundee iron foundry.

In 1876 Robert Stirling wrote a letter acknowledging the importance of Henry Bessemer&#x27;s new invention, the Bessemer process for the manufacture of steel. Stirling was optimistic that the new steel would improve the performance of the air engines.

Robert Stirling&#x27;s development of the hot air engine was in part motivated by safety. His engine was designed to fail far less catastrophically than the steam engines of the time while obtaining greater efficiency. Though the Stirling engine is rarely used today, its seemingly perpetual motion capability continues to draw the interest of research institutions like Los Alamos National Laboratory and NASA.

== Personal life and death ==

<text>The municipalities (; ) represent the local level of administration in Finland and act as the fundamental, self-governing administrative units of the country. The entire country is incorporated into municipalities and legally, all municipalities are equal, although certain municipalities are called cities or towns (; ). Municipalities have the right to levy a flat percentual income tax, which is between 16 and 22 percent, and they provide two thirds of public services. Municipalities control many community services, such as schools, health care and the water supply, and local streets. They do not maintain highways, set laws or keep police forces, which are responsibilities of the central government.

==Government==
Municipalities have council-manager government: they are governed by an elected council (, ), which is legally autonomous and answers only to the voters. The size of the council is proportional to the population, the extremes being 9 in Sottunga and 85 in Helsinki. A subsection of the council, the municipal executive board (&quot;kunnanhallitus&quot;), controls the municipal government and monitors the implementation of decisions of the council. Its decisions must be approved by the council. Unlike national cabinets, its composition is derived from the composition of the council, not along government-opposition lines. Furthermore, individual decisions are prepared in specialized municipal boards (&quot;lautakunta&quot;) for a council meeting, which include, for example, zoning, social assistance, and education boards. Council, executive board, and municipal board memberships are elected positions of responsibility, not full-time jobs. Remuneration depends on the municipality and position, but is generally nominal or modest: a regular council member is paid 70 euro on average on a per-meeting basis (2017).

Municipal managers (, for cities, , for other municipalities) are civil servants named by the council. The city manager of Helsinki is called / &quot;Lord Mayor&quot; for historical reasons. There were previously no mayors in Finland, but after a change in law, Tampere was first city to elect a mayor ( / ) in 2007. The mayor is not, however, currently elected directly, but by the municipal council. The mayor acts as municipal manager and as a speaker of municipal council.

Although municipalities do not have police or legislative powers, local ordinances concerning traffic can be set, and municipal parking inspectors can give parking tickets. Municipalities are legal persons and can appear in an administrative court. Likewise, the state of Finland is a separate legal person.

Excluding judicial review of formal compliance to administrative law, municipalities are independent and not a part of a local state hierarchy. Municipalities cooperate in regions of Finland. State agencies have jurisdictions spanning one or more regions: each region is served by an &quot;ely-keskus&quot; (&quot;elinkeino-, liikenne- ja ympäristökeskus&quot;) on matters of employment, the economy, transport and environment, while law and environmental enforcement is handled by the local &quot;aluehallintovirasto&quot;, governing multi-region jurisdictions termed &quot;alue&quot;.-G.H-

==Taxation and revenue==

Residents pay a municipal tax that is a form of income tax, which is the mainstay of the income of a municipality (42% of income). Municipal tax is nominally a flat tax that is levied from a broader population (including lower income levels) than progressive state income tax, which is collected only from medium to high income earners. However, in practice even the municipal tax is progressive due to generous deductions granted to the lowest income levels. The pre-deduction base tax varies from 16% in affluent Kauniainen to 20% or more in a number of small rural municipalities. Next to the municipal tax, municipalities receive funding from the state budget (, 19% of income). This funding is means-tested to municipality wealth and serves to balance the differences in municipal tax revenue. Besides taxes, sales revenue, fees and profit of operations also form a substantial share of municipal income (21%). In 2023, taxation will be significantly changed, when new wellbeing services counties are founded. Since these are funded by the state, municipal taxes will be reduced by 12.64 percentage points from ~20 to ~7%, and state taxes will be increased correspondingly.

Additionally, municipalities levy a property tax, amounting to 3.6% of income, which is comparatively low: the annual fee is 0.32-0.75% of net present value for permanent residences and 0.50-1.00% for leisure properties like summer cottages as well as undeveloped plots. This is always paid by the owner, never a tenant directly, unlike the council tax. Municipalities receive a share of corporate tax revenue () from companies having a place of business in the municipality (3.8% of income).

Some municipal functions receive direct funding both from the municipality and the state, e.g. AMK vocational colleges.

== Tasks and services ==

Finland has an extensive public welfare system, and municipalities are responsible for much of the services to that end. Tasks of the municipalities are as follows:

* Social services
** Children&#x27;s daycare
** Elderly care
** Disabled care
** Social welfare service
** Child protection
* Education (see Education in Finland) and culture
** Peruskoulu (primary education, grades 1–9)
** Lukio (gymnasiums)
** Ammattioppilaitos (secondary vocational schools)
** (tertiary vocational schools)
** Kansanopisto (folk high school)
** Public libraries
** Youth centres
** Public exercise facilities (public tracks, etc.)
* Infrastructure and land use
** Zoning
**Public transport
** Maintenance of local streets
** Water
** Energy
** Waste collection
** Environment
* Economic development
** Promotion of the local economy and employment
* Law enforcement
** Food safety inspection
** Animal welfare inspection
** Environmental protection inspection
** Parking enforcement
** Public transport payment enforcement

Although municipalities are responsible for their own finances, there is much highly specific legislation and regulation that requires the services to be provided up to a standard. Thus, although municipalities have the power to voluntarily spend tax-generated income, they are required to first allocate funds to legally prescribed services.

Municipalities may provide some of these services through corporations that they own or from private companies that they regulate. For example, 
Helsinki Regional Transport Authority (HSL) provides public transport services in the capital area.

From 2023, new wellbeing services counties will take the responsibility for healthcare and social services from the municipalities.

==Statistics==

, there are 309 municipalities in Finland, and from 1 January 2025 308, of which (the following numbers not updated) 107 are cities or towns (&quot;kaupunki&quot;). Sixteen municipalities are unilingually Swedish (all in the autonomous Åland region), while 33 are bilingual: 15 with Swedish as the majority language (all but four in Ostrobothnia) and 18 with Finnish as the majority language (all but five in Uusimaa region). Four municipalities in northern Lapland (Utsjoki, Inari, Sodankylä and Enontekiö) have one or all of the three Sami languages spoken in Finland as an official language.

Finnish municipalities can choose to be called either &quot;kaupunki&quot; (city or town) or &quot;kunta&quot; (small town or rural municipality). Although the Finnish Environment Institute classifies urban settlements with over 15,000 inhabitants as &quot;kaupunki&quot;, municipalities can name themselves &quot;kaupunki&quot; with fewer inhabitants. There are inhabitants in Nurmijärvi, the largest &quot;kunta&quot; in Finland, and inhabitants in Kaskinen, the smallest &quot;kaupunki&quot;, so the kunta–kaupunki categorisation mainly concerns the name of the municipality.

The areas of the municipalities vary, as the population is the primary criterion for forming a municipality. The largest municipalities in size are found in Lapland, of which the largest is Inari at (130 km square). The smallest municipalities are very small towns. Kaskinen is an independent town with a land area of only . Kauniainen, which was originally a corporation in Espoo, is only .

==History==

Municipalities were originally parishes. The old word for a municipality is , &#x27;keeper&#x27;, because when the system was instituted, one municipality kept one minister. Municipalities were divided into villages, which consisted of individual properties. Borders between properties and thus municipalities were defined by oral agreements passed down from generation to generation; usually along straight lines between defined markers such as boulders. Medieval documentation survives only from legal disputes concerning borders. In the 18th century, King Gustaf III implemented the Great Partition, where common lands were redistributed into larger properties, and claimed all unclaimed land to the crown. Thus, there is no &quot;leftover&quot; land outside the jurisdiction of municipalities, as all land belongs to either to a private property or to the government. The secular government divided the properties to taxable units (villages and secular municipalities) according to its own convenience, which were not necessarily convergent with parishes. Furthermore, cities were chartered separately. Up to 1734, the law was different in cities than in rural municipalities.

On 6 February 1865, the modern municipalities were established as secular entities separate from the parishes. The reform was inspired by the Swedish municipal reforms of 1862. Up to 1964, cities financed their own police and registry services. Until 1977 municipalities were divided into cities (, ), market towns (, ) and rural municipalities (, ). The market town category was abolished and these were renamed as cities. The rest of the municipalities were classified as &#x27;other municipalities&#x27;. All municipalities called maalaiskunta were eventually either merged to their parent cities or changed their names. From 1995 onwards only &#x27;municipality&#x27; is recognized by law and any municipality is allowed to call itself a city.

==Identification and heraldry==

Not all municipalities have an obvious urban center; indeed, rural municipalities are often composed of distributed rural villages. Although the church village (&quot;kirkonkylä&quot;, abbreviated &quot;kk&quot;) is the historical center, the largest or administrative center may be in another village. For example, Askola has a church village (Askolan kirkonkylä), but its administrative center is in Monninkylä. Often, the church village has the same name as the municipality, as with Askola. However, this is not necessarily so, e.g. Enontekiö is governed from Hetta; these villages are often erroneously labeled in maps. This is expected as the name of the municipality refers to the entire parish, not just a single center like a church village. Villages have no administrative role, although some have voluntary village associations (&quot;kyläyhdistys&quot;) and other non-governmental public life.

Although related, urban areas in Finland (&quot;taajama&quot;) are not local administrative units. A catalog is independently compiled each year by Statistics Finland, a state agency, and used primarily for traffic-related purposes (signage, speed limits, and highway planning). There are 745 officially recognized urban areas in Finland, 49 of which have more than 10,000 inhabitants and six more than 100,000.

Each municipality has a distinct coat of arms. They are posted on the municipal borders and shown in official documents representing the municipality. The coats of arms for many municipalities have been designed in the modern era, many of them by Gustaf von Numers. In addition, municipalities like Vantaa since 2015 and Helsinki since 2017 have a logo distinct from their coat of arms.

==Capital region==
Distinctively, the Helsinki capital region, has no special arrangements. The area consists of four entirely independent cities that form a continuous conurbation. The Helsinki metropolitan area has grown in population and area relatively quickly: the nearby municipalities, considered rural only 50 years ago, have become suburbs, and the growth is projected to continue. A state-imposed merger of Helsinki and a part of Sipoo, a rural, 40% Swedish-speaking municipality adjacent to the Helsinki metropolitan area, was approved by the government in 2006, counter to the opinion of the Sipoo municipal council. This area will effectively become a new (and Finnish-speaking) suburb with multiple times the inhabitants than there are in Sipoo.

==Mergers and reform==
There is currently a heated political debate in Finland about reforming the municipality system. Essentially, a multitude of small municipalities is seen as detrimental to the provision of public services, having originated during Finland&#x27;s agrarian years. As a result, there have been suggestions of state-imposed mergers. A committee led by the former Minister for Regional and Municipal Affairs, Hannes Manninen, suggested creating a two-tier system of municipalities with different powers, while the Association of Finnish Local and Regional Authorities () favoured a system where municipalities would be units of at least 20,000–30,000 inhabitants, cf. the current median at 4,700. The motion was inspired by a similar reform in Denmark (see Municipalities of Denmark). The former government (Vanhanen II), however, planned to not impose mergers.

Recently, many voluntary mergers have been agreed on. Ten mergers were completed in 2005, one in 2006, 14 in 2007 and one in 2008. In 2009, there were even more, many of which consolidated more than two municipalities. Several cities merged with surrounding rural municipalities in Hämeenlinna, Salo, Kouvola, Seinäjoki, Naantali, Kauhava, Lohja, Raseborg, Jyväskylä and Oulu in 2009. In total, there were 32 mergers, involving 99 municipalities, that reduced the number of municipalities by 67. The year 2009 also marked the end of the last &quot;maalaiskunta&quot;, a municipality surrounding a city but sharing the name, in Jyväskylä. There were four mergers in 2010, six in 2011, ten in 2013, three in 2015, four in 2016, two in 2017, one in 2020 and one in 2021. In the period 2005–2021, the number of municipalities was voluntarily reduced from 444 to 309.

In 2012, Katainen&#x27;s government published an extensive plan aiming at merging municipalities to reach a target of population 20,000 per municipality. Commuter belts have also been proposed as a target by a government committee, such that municipalities where more than 35% of workforce commutes would be subject to a merger.

The Sipilä cabinet, from 2015, had been preparing a significant reform of health and social services (&quot;sote-uudistus&quot;), aimed at increasing choice between municipal and private healthcare, and assigning some healthcare responsibilities into larger units than a municipality. This was finished by the Marin cabinet.

<text>In the formal sciences, the domain of discourse, also called the universe of discourse, [[universe (mathematics)|universal set]], or simply [[universe (mathematics)|universe]], is the set of entities over which certain variables of interest in some formal treatment may range.

==Overview==

The domain of discourse is usually identified in the preliminaries, so that there is no need in the further treatment to specify each time the range of the relevant variables. Many logicians distinguish, sometimes only tacitly, between the &quot;domain of a science&quot; and the &quot;universe of discourse of a formalization of the science&quot;. 

==Examples==
For example, in an interpretation of first-order logic, the domain of discourse is the set of individuals over which the quantifiers range. A proposition such as is ambiguous if no domain of discourse has been identified. In one interpretation, the domain of discourse could be the set of real numbers; in another interpretation, it could be the set of natural numbers. If the domain of discourse is the set of real numbers, the proposition is false, with as counterexample; if the domain is the set of natural numbers, the proposition is true, since 2 is not the square of any natural number.

==Universe of discourse==
The term &quot;universe of discourse&quot; generally refers to the collection of objects being discussed in a specific discourse. In model-theoretical semantics, a universe of discourse is the set of entities that a model is based on. The concept &quot;universe of discourse&quot; was used for the first time by George Boole (1854) on page 42 of his &quot;Laws of Thought&quot;. Boole&#x27;s definition is quoted below. The concept, probably discovered independently by Boole in 1847, played a crucial role in his philosophy of logic especially in his principle of wholistic reference.

Alfred North Whitehead cited Augustus De Morgan as identifying &quot;that limited class of things which is the special subject of discourse on any particular occasion. Such a class was called by De Morgan, the Universe of Discourse.&quot;

Lewis Carroll expressed the need for a universe of discourse as follows:
It sometimes happens that, in one or both of the Terms of a Proposition, the Name consists of Adjectives only, the Substantive being understood. In order to express such a Proposition &quot;fully&quot;, we must supply the Name of some Class which may be regarded as a Genus of which each Term is a Species...The Genus referred to is called the Universe of Discourse...

==Boole’s 1854 definition==

==Illustration==
The binary relation called set membership, expressed as formula_1, and meaning that &quot;x&quot; belongs to set &quot;A&quot;, is clear enough. Every binary relation has a converse relation, and the converse of formula_2. Also, a binary relation must have a domain. The domain of the converse of set membership is the universe of discourse. Any subset of this universe may, or may not, contain &quot;x&quot;. &quot;A&quot; is a subset of this universe, not necessarily restricted to &quot;A&quot;.

<text>The Green Park, one of the Royal Parks of London, is in the City of Westminster, Central London. Green Park is to the north of the gardens and semi-circular forecourt of Buckingham Palace, across Constitution Hill road. The park is in the middle of a near-continuous chain of green spaces in Westminster that includes St James&#x27;s Park, Hyde Park, and Kensington Gardens. To the northwest of Green Park is the district of St James&#x27;s including, Lancaster House, Clarence House, and St James&#x27;s Palace.

First enclosed in the 17th century by King Charles II, it was landscaped in 1820 and is notable among central London parks for having no lakes or buildings, and only minimal flower planting in the form of naturalised narcissus.

==Description and surroundings==
Green Park covers just over between Hyde Park and St. James&#x27;s Park. Together with Kensington Gardens and the gardens of Buckingham Palace, these parks form an almost unbroken stretch of tended green land. This combined parkland is mostly bounded on the four cardinal compass points by Horse Guards Parade or adjoining Downing Street (east); the Victoria/Belgravia district (south); Kensington and Notting Hill (west) and St James&#x27;s, Mayfair and Bayswater (north).

In contrast with its neighbouring parks, Green Park has no lakes, no buildings, no playgrounds and three, early yet distinctive post-war-era public monuments:
*The &quot;Canada Memorial&quot; by Pierre Granche
*The &quot;Diana of the Treetops Fountain&quot; by Estcourt J Clack, by the park&#x27;s eponymous tube station
*The &quot;RAF Bomber Command Memorial&quot; by Philip Jackson in a hardscaped road apex (sometimes considered Hyde Park Corner, facing it).

The park consists almost entirely of mature trees rising out of turf; the only flowers are naturalised narcissus.

The park is bounded on the south by Constitution Hill, on the east by the pedestrian Queen&#x27;s Walk, and on the north by Piccadilly. It meets St. James&#x27;s Park at Queen&#x27;s Gardens with the Victoria Memorial at its centre, opposite the entrance to Buckingham Palace. To the south is the ceremonial avenue of the Mall, and the buildings of St James&#x27;s Palace and Clarence House overlook the park to the east. Green Park Underground station has platforms of the Piccadilly, Victoria and Jubilee lines. It is by the north end of Queen&#x27;s Walk. Tyburn stream runs beneath Green Park.

In 2016 one acre of the park near the Bomber Command Memorial was designated as the 90th Coronation Meadow, named The Queen&#x27;s Meadow, and established as a wildflower meadow using seed taken from ancient meadows at Horsenden Meadow in Ealing, and Valebridge Common in West Sussex. In 2017 a wide range of flowers were reported such as yellow rattle and common poppy.

==History==

The park is said to have in been for many medieval years a swampy burial ground for lepers from the hospital at St James&#x27;s on its north side. It was first enclosed in the 16th century to be part of the estate of Poulteney family. It was then, as probably earlier too, partly excavated for the sand for the mortar for brickwork and stone building elements. In 1668, this part of &quot;the Poulteney estate&quot;, the &quot;Sandpit Field&quot;, was surrendered to Charles II, who made the bulk of the land into a Royal Park as &quot;Upper St James&#x27;s Park&quot; and enclosed it with a brick wall. He laid out its main walks and built an icehouse to supply the household with ice for cooling drinks in summer.

In 1746, Upper St. James&#x27;s Park was officially renamed The Green Park. The park was an open meadow with few flowers at the time but this state may arise from a feud between Charles II of England and his Queen Consort, Catherine of Braganza. The oral history says the Queen discovered Charles had picked flowers in the park for another woman. In revenge, the Queen ordered that every single flower in the park should be pulled up and no more planted.
The Queen&#x27;s Walk was laid out for George II&#x27;s queen Caroline; it led to the reservoir that held drinking water for St James&#x27;s Palace, called the Queen&#x27;s Basin.

Until a few decades later the park was on the outskirts of London; it was dark and somewhat semi-rural. It was known as a haunt of highwaymen and thieves. During the 18th and 19th centuries, it was a popular place for ballooning attempts and public firework displays; Handel&#x27;s &quot;Music for the Royal Fireworks&quot; was composed specifically for a fireworks celebration held in The Green Park in 1749. The park was also known as a duelling ground; one particularly notorious one being in 1730 between William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath and John Hervey, 1st Earl of Bristol.

In 1820, John Nash landscaped the park, as an adjunct to St James&#x27;s Park. On 10 June 1840, it was the scene of Edward Oxford&#x27;s assassination attempt on Queen Victoria, on Constitution Hill.

<text>At the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, many shooting events were featured within the concurrent 1900 Exposition Universelle, but only eight events currently are considered as &quot;Olympic&quot; by IOC. Before July 2021 the International Olympic Committee has never decided which events were &quot;Olympic&quot; and which were not. The competitions were held from 3 August to 5 August and took place at the military sporting complex in Satory and at Boulogne-Billancourt. According to Olympic historian Bill Mallon, one of these nine shooting events (20 metre military pistol) was an event for professionals with prize money and therefore does not meet inclusion criteria for 1900 Olympic Games events.

==Medal summary==

Event that currently is not considered as &quot;Olympic&quot; by IOC.
==Excluded events==

Competitors in these events had to kill as many live pigeons as possible. Birds were released one at a time from &#x27;traps&#x27; in front of the shooters; winners were determined by whoever shot the most birds out of the sky. A shooter was eliminated once they missed two birds. Nearly 300 birds were killed. A prize purse of up to 20,000 Francs was awarded to the winners, though the top four finishers agreed to split the winnings. This was the first and only time in Olympic history when animals were killed on purpose. Animal rights campaigns were mounted to stop live shooting; in 1902 bans came into force in the United States leading to the introduction of clay pigeons. The following results are not included in the IOC Olympic results list:

Live pigeon shooting – 20 franc entrance fee

Live pigeon shooting – 200 franc entrance fee

<text>Piccadilly () is a road in the City of Westminster, London, England, to the south of Mayfair, between Hyde Park Corner in the west and Piccadilly Circus in the east. It is part of the A4 road that connects central London to Hammersmith, Earl&#x27;s Court, Heathrow Airport and the M4 motorway westward. St James&#x27;s is to the south of the eastern section, while the western section is built up only on the northern side. Piccadilly is just under in length, and it is one of the widest and straightest streets in central London.
The street has been a main thoroughfare since at least medieval times, and in the Middle Ages was known as &quot;the road to Reading&quot; or &quot;the way from Colnbrook&quot;. Around 1611 or 1612, Robert Baker acquired land in the area, and prospered by making and selling piccadills. Shortly after purchasing the land, he enclosed it and erected several dwellings, including his home, Pikadilly Hall. What is now Piccadilly was named Portugal Street in 1663 after Catherine of Braganza, wife of Charles II, and grew in importance after the road from Charing Cross to Hyde Park Corner was closed to allow the creation of Green Park in 1668. Some of the most notable stately homes in London were built on the northern side of the street during this period, including Clarendon House and Burlington House in 1664. Berkeley House, constructed around the same time as Clarendon House, was destroyed by a fire in 1733 and rebuilt as Devonshire House in 1737 by William Cavendish, 3rd Duke of Devonshire. It was later used as the main headquarters for the Whig party. Burlington House has since been home to several noted societies, including the Royal Academy of Arts, the Geological Society of London, the Linnean Society, and the Royal Astronomical Society. Several members of the Rothschild family had mansions at the western end of the street. St James&#x27;s Church was consecrated in 1684 and the surrounding area became St James Parish.

The Old White Horse Cellar, at No. 155, was one of the most famous coaching inns in England by the late 18th century, by which time the street had become a favoured location for booksellers. The Bath Hotel emerged around 1790, and Walsingham House was built in 1887. Both the Bath and the Walsingham were purchased and demolished, and the prestigious Ritz Hotel built on their site in 1906. Piccadilly Circus station, at the east end of the street, was opened in 1906 and rebuilt to designs by Charles Holden between 1925 and 1928. The clothing store Simpson&#x27;s was established at Nos. 203–206 Piccadilly by Alec Simpson in 1936. During the 20th century, Piccadilly became known as a place to acquire heroin, and was notorious in the 1960s as the centre of London&#x27;s illegal drug trade. Today, it is regarded as one of London&#x27;s principal shopping streets. Its landmarks include the Ritz, Park Lane, Athenaeum and Intercontinental hotels, Fortnum &amp; Mason, the Royal Academy, the RAF Club, Hatchards, the Embassy of Japan and the High Commission of Malta.

Piccadilly has inspired several works of fiction, including Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; and the work of P. G. Wodehouse. It is one of a group of squares on the London Monopoly board.

==History==

===Early history===
The street has been part of a main road for centuries, although there is no evidence that it was part of a Roman road, unlike Oxford Street further north. In the Middle Ages it was known as &quot;the road to Reading&quot; or &quot;the way from Colnbrook&quot;. During the Tudor period, relatively settled conditions made expansion beyond London&#x27;s city walls a safer venture. Property speculation became a lucrative enterprise, and developments grew so rapidly that the threat of disease and disorder prompted the government to ban developments. Owing to the momentum of growth, the laws had little real effect.

A plot of land bounded by Coventry, Sherwood, Glasshouse and Rupert streets and the line of Smith&#x27;s Court was granted by Elizabeth I to William Dodington, a gentleman of London, in 1559–60. A year or so later it was owned by a brewer, Thomas Wilson of St Botolph-without-Aldgate. The grant did not include a small parcel of land, acres in area, on the east of what is now Great Windmill Street. That plot may have never belonged to the Crown, and was owned by Anthony Cotton in the reign of Henry VIII. John Cotton granted it to John Golightly in 1547, and his descendants sold it to a tailor, Robert Baker, in –12. Six or seven years later, Baker bought 22 acres of Wilson&#x27;s land, thanks largely to money from his second marriage.

Baker became financially successful by making and selling fashionable piccadills. Shortly after purchasing the land, he enclosed it (the parishioners had Lammas grazing rights) and erected several dwellings, including a residence and shop for himself; within two years his house was known as Pickadilly Hall. A map published by Faithorne in 1658 describes the street as &quot;the way from Knightsbridge to Piccadilly Hall&quot;. A nearby gaming house, known as Shaver&#x27;s Hall and nicknamed &quot;Tart Hall&quot; or &quot;Pickadell Hall&quot;, was popular with the gentry of London. Lord Dell lost £3,000 gambling at cards there in 1641.

After Robert Baker&#x27;s death in 1623 and the death of his eldest son Samuel shortly afterward, his widow and her father purchased the wardship of their surviving children; the death of the next eldest son, Robert in 1630 allowed them to effectively control the estate. Their only daughter died, and her widower Sir Henry Oxenden retained an interest in the land. Several relatives claimed it, but after Mary Baker&#x27;s death in about 1665, the estate reverted to the Crown. A great-nephew, John Baker, obtained possession of part of it, but squabbled over the lands with his cousin, James Baker; trying to play one another off, they paid or granted rights to Oxenden and a speculator, Colonel Thomas Panton, eventually losing out to them. By the 1670s, Panton was developing the lands; despite the claims of some distantly related Bakers, he steadily built them up.

===Later 17th century===
Piccadilly was named Portugal Street in 1663 after Catherine of Braganza, wife of Charles II. Its importance to traffic increased after an earlier road from Charing Cross to Hyde Park Corner was closed to allow the creation of Green Park in 1668. After the restoration of the English monarchy in 1660, Charles II encouraged the development of Portugal Street and the area to the north (Mayfair), and they became fashionable residential localities. Some of the grandest mansions in London were built on the northern side of the street. Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon and close political adviser to the king, purchased land for a house; Clarendon House (now the location of Albemarle Street) was built in 1664, and the earl sold the surplus land partly to Sir John Denham, who built what later became Burlington House. Denham chose the location because it was on the outskirts of London surrounded by fields. The house was first used to house the poor, before being reconstructed by the third Earl of Burlington in 1718. Berkeley House was constructed around the same time as Clarendon House. It was destroyed by a fire in 1733, and rebuilt as Devonshire House in 1737 by William Cavendish, 3rd Duke of Devonshire, and was subsequently used as the headquarters for the Whig party. Devonshire House survived until 1921, before being sold for redevelopment by Edward Cavendish, 10th Duke of Devonshire for £1 million. Burlington House has since been home to the Royal Academy of Arts, the Geological Society of London, the Linnean Society of London, the Royal Astronomical Society, the British Astronomical Association, the Society of Antiquaries of London and the Royal Society of Chemistry.
The land to the south of Piccadilly was leased to trustees of the Earl of St Albans in 1661 for a thirty-year term, subsequently extended to 1740. Nos. 162–165 were granted freehold by the king to Sir Edward Villiers in 1674. The White Bear Inn had been established between what is now No. 221 Piccadilly and the parallel Jermyn Street since 1685. It remained in use throughout the 18th century before being demolished in 1870 to make way for a restaurant.

St James&#x27;s Church was first proposed in 1664, when residents wanted the area to become a separate parish from St Martin in the Fields. After several Bill readings, construction began in 1676. The building was designed by Christopher Wren and cost around £5,000. It was consecrated in 1684, when the surrounding area became St James Parish.

By 1680, most of the original residential properties along Portugal Street had been demolished or built over. The name Piccadilly was applied to part of the street east of Swallow Street by 1673, and eventually became the &quot;de facto&quot; name for the entire length of Portugal Street. A plan of the area around St James Parish in 1720 describes the road as &quot;Portugal Street &quot;aka&quot; Piccadilly&quot;. John Rocque&#x27;s Map of London, published in 1746, refers to the entire street as Piccadilly.

===18th–19th centuries===

Piccadilly was increasingly developed, and by the middle of the 18th century it was continuously built on as far as Hyde Park Corner. The development of St James&#x27;s and Mayfair, in particular, made Piccadilly one of the busiest roads in London. Hugh Mason and William Fortnum started the Fortnum &amp; Mason partnership on Piccadilly in 1705, selling recycled candles from Buckingham Palace. By 1788, the store sold poultry, potted meats, lobsters and prawns, savoury patties, Scotch eggs, and fresh and dried fruits.

The street acquired a reputation for numerous inns and bars during this period. The Old White Horse Cellar, at No. 155, was one of the most famous coaching inns in England but was later destroyed. The Black Bear and White Bear (originally the Fleece) public houses were nearly opposite each other, although the former was demolished in about 1820. Also of note were the Hercules&#x27; Pillars, just west of Hamilton Place, the Triumphant Car, which was popular with soldiers, and the White Horse and Half Moon. The Bath Hotel emerged around 1790 and Walsingham House was built in 1887. The Bath and the Walsingham were demolished when the Ritz Hotel opened on the site in 1906.

No. 106, on the corner of Piccadilly and Brick Street, was built for Hugh Hunlock in 1761. It was subsequently owned by the 6th Earl of Coventry who remodelled it around 1765; most of the architecture from this renovation has survived. In 1869, it became home to the St James&#x27;s Club, a gentleman&#x27;s club that remained there until 1978. The building is now the London campus of the Limkokwing University of Creative Technology.

Several members of the Rothschild family had mansions at the western end of the street. Nathan Mayer Rothschild moved his banking premises to No. 107 in 1825, and the construction of other large buildings, complete with ballrooms and marble staircases, led to the street being colloquially referred to as Rothschild Row. Ferdinand James von Rothschild lived at No. 143 with his wife Evelina while Lionel de Rothschild lived at No. 148. Melbourne House was designed by William Chambers for Peniston Lamb, 1st Viscount Melbourne and built between 1770 and 1774. It was converted to apartments in 1802, and is now the Albany. The house has been the residence for the British Prime Ministers William Ewart Gladstone and Edward Heath. St James&#x27;s Hall was designed by Owen Jones and built between 1857 and 1858. Charles Dickens gave several readings of his novels in the hall, including &quot;Great Expectations&quot; and &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;. The hall hosted performances from Antonín Dvořák, Edvard Grieg and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. It was demolished in 1905, and replaced by the Piccadilly Hotel.
In the late 18th century, Piccadilly was a favoured place for booksellers. In 1765, John Almon opened a shop in No. 178, which was frequented by Lord Temple and other Whigs. John Stockdale opened a shop on No. 181 in 1781. The business continued after his death in 1810, and was run by his family until 1835. Hatchards, now the oldest surviving bookshop in Britain, was started by John Hatchard at No. 173 in 1797; it moved to the current location at No. 189–190 (now No. 187) in 1801. Aldine Press moved to Piccadilly from Chancery Lane in 1842, and remained there until 1894.

The Egyptian Hall at No. 170, designed in 1812 by P. F. Robinson for W. Bullock of Liverpool, was modelled on Ancient Egyptian architecture, particularly the Great Temple of Dendera (Tentyra). One author described it as &quot;one of the strangest places Piccadilly ever knew&quot;. It was a venue for exhibitions by the Society of Painters in Water Colours and the Society of Female Artists during the 19th century. It contained numerous Egyptian antiquaries; at an auction in June 1822, two &quot;imperfect&quot; Sekhmet statues were sold for £380, and a flawless one went for £300.

The premises at 190–195, built in 1881–1883, housing the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours and known as the &quot;Royal Institute Galleries&quot;, are grade II listed. Number 195 is now home to BAFTA, Lyons&#x27; first teashop opened in Piccadilly in 1894, and from 1909 they developed into a chain, ultimately numbering around 200 locations, with the firm becoming a staple of the High Street in the UK.

===20th–21st centuries===

By the 1920s, most old buildings on the street had been demolished or were in institutional use; traffic noise had driven away residents, but a few residential properties remained. Albert, Duke of York was living at 145 Piccadilly at the time of his accession as King George VI in 1936; it was badly damaged by a bomb during the London Blitz.
The clothing store Simpson&#x27;s was established at 203–206 Piccadilly by Alec Simpson in 1936, providing factory-made men&#x27;s clothing. The premises were designed by the architect Joseph Amberton in a style that mixed art deco and Bauhaus school design and an influence from Louis Sullivan. On opening, it claimed to be the largest menswear store in London. It closed in January 1999; its premises are currently the flagship shop of the booksellers Waterstones.

During the 20th century, Piccadilly became known as a place to acquire heroin. Jazz trumpeter Dizzy Reece recalled people queuing outside Piccadilly&#x27;s branch of Boots for heroin pills in the late 1940s. By the 1960s, the street and surrounding area were notorious as the centre of London&#x27;s illegal drug trade, where heroin and cocaine could be purchased on the black market from unscrupulous chemists. By 1982, up to 20 people could be seen queueing at a chemist dealing in illegal drugs in nearby Shaftesbury Avenue. No. 144 was occupied by squatters in 1968, taking advantage of a law that allowed disused buildings to be used for emergency shelter for the homeless. The radical squatting movement that resulted foundered soon afterward, owing to the rise of drug dealers and Hells Angels occupying the site. An eviction took place on 21 September 1969; the events resulted in the licensing of squatting organisations that could take over empty premises to use as homeless shelters. In 1983, A. Burr of the &quot;British Journal of Addiction&quot; published an article on &quot;The Piccadilly Drug Scene&quot;, in which the author discussed the regular presence of known dealers and easy accessibility of drugs.

Today, Piccadilly is regarded as one of London&#x27;s principal shopping streets, hosting several famous shops. The Ritz Hotel, Park Lane Hotel, Athenaeum Hotel and Intercontinental Hotel are located on the street, along with other luxury hotels and offices. During the 20th century, it had been an established area for gentlemen&#x27;s clubs; this usage has sharply declined, and only the Cavalry and Guards Club and the Royal Air Force Club remain.

==Transport==

Piccadilly is a major thoroughfare in the West End of London and has several major road junctions. To the east, Piccadilly Circus opened in 1819 connecting it to Regent Street. It has become one of the most recognised landmarks in London, particularly after a statue of Eros was constructed on the junction in 1893, and the erection of large electric billboards in 1923. At the western end of Piccadilly is Hyde Park Corner, and the street has a major road junction with St James&#x27;s Street and other significant junctions at Albemarle Street, Bond Street and Dover Street.

The road is part of the A4 connecting central London to Hammersmith, Earl&#x27;s Court, Heathrow Airport and the M4 motorway. Congestion along the road has been reported since the mid-19th century, leading to its progressive widening and removing the northern portions of Green Park. Traffic signals were installed in the 1930s. In the late 1950s, the Ministry of Transport remodelled Hyde Park Corner at the western end to form a major traffic gyratory system, including enlargement of Park Lane. It opened on 17 October 1962 at a cost of £5 million.

The London bus routes 6, 9, 14, 19, 22, 38, N9, N19, N22, N38 and N97 all run along Piccadilly. In 1972, a westbound bus lane was introduced between Piccadilly Circus and St James&#x27;s Street. In November 1976 an eastbound bus lane was introduced between Old Park Lane and Berkeley Street. Part of the Piccadilly line on the London Underground travels under the street. , , and stations (which are all on the Piccadilly line) have entrances in or near Piccadilly. also served the western end of the street from 1907 until it closed in 1932 because of low usage.

==Cultural references==
 is one of Letitia Elizabeth Landon&#x27;s &quot;Scenes in London&quot; in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1836. It is evocative of many aspects of life in the city, both by day and by night. 

The music hall song &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to Tipperary&quot; mentions Piccadilly and Leicester Square in its lyrics. It was written in 1912 about an Irishman living in London, but became popular after being adopted by the mostly Irish Connaught Rangers during World War I. The street is mentioned in Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s 1881 operetta &quot;Patience&quot;, in the lyrics of the song &quot;If You&#x27;re Anxious For To Shine&quot;. One of the major hit songs of the Edwardian musical play &quot;The Arcadians&quot; (1909) which enjoyed long runs in the West End of London and on New York&#x27;s Broadway is &quot;All down Piccadilly&quot; (Simplicitas and Chorus, Act III, revised version), with music by Lionel Monckton who also co-wrote the words with Arthur Wimperis.

Piccadilly is mentioned in several works of fiction. E. W. Hornung&#x27;s &quot;gentleman thief&quot; Raffles lives at the Albany, as does Jack Worthing from Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;. According to author Mary C King, Wilde chose the street because of its resemblance to the Spanish word &quot;peccadillo&quot;, meaning &quot;slashed&quot; or &quot;pierced&quot;. In Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s novel &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot;, the mansion Marchmain House, supposedly located in a cul-de-sac off St James&#x27;s near Piccadilly, is demolished and replaced with flats. In the 1981 Granada Television dramatisation, Bridgewater House in Cleveland Row was used as the exterior of Marchmain House. In Bram Stoker&#x27;s novel Dracula, Jonathan Harker is astonished to see the Count in Piccadilly, which sets off a chain of events that leads to the formation of the group of vampire hunters. Later, Dracula is confronted by the vampire hunters in his house in Piccadilly, before making his escape. In Arthur Machen&#x27;s 1894 novella &quot;The Great God Pan&quot;, Helen Vaughan, the satanic villainess and offspring of Pan, lives off Piccadilly in the pseudonymous Ashley Street. Margery Allingham&#x27;s fictional detective Albert Campion has a flat at 17A Bottle Street, Piccadilly, over a police station, although Bottle Street is equally fictitious. Several P.G. Wodehouse novels use the setting of Piccadilly as the playground of the rich, idle bachelor in the inter-war period of the 20th century. Notable instances are present in the characters of Bertie Wooster and his Drones Club companions in the Jeeves stories, and the character of James Crocker in the story &quot;Piccadilly Jim&quot;. Dorothy Sayers&#x27; fictional detective Lord Peter Wimsey is described as living at 110A Piccadilly in the inter-war period.

In the 1963 movie &quot;The Great Escape&quot; the character Ashley-Pitt portrayed by David McCallum tells Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett &quot;See you in Piccadilly, Scott&#x27;s Bar&quot; as he was making his escape from the tunnel.

The street is a square on the British Monopoly board, forming a set with Leicester Square and Coventry Street. When a European Union version of the game was produced in 1992, Piccadilly was one of three London streets selected, along with Oxford Street and Park Lane.

In 1996, Latvian singer Laima Vaikule released an album titled &quot;Ya vyshla na Pikadilli&quot; (&quot;I Went Out on Piccadilly&quot;).

In 2019, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare featured a game level designed around the street.

<doc id="229187" wikidata="Q1984811" url="?curid=229187" title="Nicholas Breton">
<text>Nicholas Breton (also Britton or Brittaine) (c. 1545/53 – c. 1625/6) was a poet and prose writer of the English Renaissance.

==Life==
Nicholas belonged to an old family settled at Layer Breton, Essex. His father, William Breton, a London merchant who had made a considerable fortune, died in 1559, and his widow Elizabeth (née Bacon) married the poet George Gascoigne before her sons had attained their majority. Nicholas was probably born at the &quot;capitall mansion house&quot; in Red Cross Street, in the parish of St Giles without Cripplegate, mentioned in his father&#x27;s will.

There is no official record of his residence at the university, but the diary of the Rev. Richard Madox tells us that he was at Antwerp in 1583 and was &quot;once of Oriel College.&quot; He may have been the English poet named &quot;Mr Briton&quot; who visited the court of James VI of Scotland in 1588 or 1589 and received a gift of £160 Scots. Breton&#x27;s friend, and a compiler of a commonplace book, Stephen Powle, noted that Breton said he had been to Scotland, and was the author of a poem about King James&#x27;s voyage to Denmark written in the King&#x27;s voice.

He married Ann Sutton in 1593, and had a family. He is supposed to have died shortly after the publication of his last work, &quot;Fantastickes&quot; (1626). Breton found a patron in Mary, countess of Pembroke, and wrote much in her honour until 1601, when she seems to have withdrawn her favour. Some of the letters signed N.B. in &quot;A Poste with a Packet of Mad Letters&quot; (1603, enlarged 1637) may contain autobiographical details; the nineteenth letter of the second part contains a general complaint of many griefs, and proceeds as follows:
Hath another been wounded in the warres, fared hard, lain in a cold bed many a bitter storme, and beene at many a hard banquet? all these have I; another imprisoned? so have I; another long been sicke? so have I; another plagued with an unquiet life? so have I; another indebted to his hearts griefe, and faine would pay and cannot? so am I.
==Works==
Breton was a prolific author of considerable versatility and gift, popular with his contemporaries, but forgotten by the next generation. His work consists of religious and pastoral poems, satires, and a number of miscellaneous prose tracts. His religious poems are sometimes wearisome by their excess of fluency and sweetness, but they are evidently the expression of a devout and earnest mind. His lyrics are pure and fresh, and his romances, though full of conceits, are pleasant reading, remarkably free from grossness. His praise of the Virgin and his references to Mary Magdalene have suggested that he was a Roman Catholic, but his prose writings abundantly prove that he was an ardent Anglican.

Breton had little gift for satire, and his best work is to be found in his pastoral poetry. His &quot;Passionate Shepheard&quot; (1604) is full of sunshine and fresh air, and of unaffected gaiety. The third pastoral in this book—&quot;Who can live in heart so glad / As the merrie country lad&quot;—is well known; with some other of Breton&#x27;s daintiest poems, among them the lullaby, &quot;Come little babe, come silly soule,&quot; (This poem, however, comes from &quot;The Arbor of Amorous Devises&quot;, which is only in part Breton&#x27;s work.) —it is incorporated in A. H. Bullen&#x27;s &quot;Lyrics from Elizabethan Romances&quot; (1890). 

The printed editions of most of Breton&#x27;s books are very rare and have great bibliographical value. His works, with the exception of some belonging to private owners, were collected by A. B. Grosart in the &quot;Chertsey Worthies Library&quot; (1879) with an elaborate introduction quoting the documents for the poet&#x27;s history. 

===&quot;Fantasticks&quot;===
Breton&#x27;s keen observation of country life appears also in his prose idyll, &quot;Wits Trenckrnour&quot;, &quot;a conference betwixt a scholler and an angler,&quot; and in his &quot;Fantasticks&quot;, a series of short prose pictures of the months, the Christian festivals and the hours, which throw much light on the customs of the times.

In 1942 the American composer Bernard Herrmann set part of &quot;Fantasticks&quot; as a piece for vocal soloists and orchestra, which he retitled &quot;The Fantasticks&quot;. He later recorded it much later with the National Philharmonic Orchestra. Herrmann brings the work to a conclusion in May, thereby altering the focus to one celebrating the arrival of spring.

<text>Piccadilly Circus is a road junction and public space of London&#x27;s West End in the City of Westminster. It was built in 1819 to connect Regent Street with Piccadilly. In this context, a &quot;circus&quot;, from the Latin word meaning &quot;circle&quot;, is a round open space at a street junction.

The Circus now connects Piccadilly, Regent Street, Shaftesbury Avenue, the Haymarket, Coventry Street (onwards to Leicester Square) and Glasshouse Street. It is close to major shopping and entertainment areas in the West End. Its status as a major traffic junction has made Piccadilly Circus a busy meeting place and a tourist attraction in its own right. The Circus is particularly known for its video display and neon signs mounted on the corner building on the northern side, as well as the Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain and statue of Anteros (which is popularly, though mistakenly, believed to be of Eros).

It is surrounded by several notable buildings, including the London Pavilion and Criterion Theatre. Underneath the plaza is Piccadilly Circus station, part of the London Underground system.

==History==
Piccadilly Circus connects to Piccadilly, a thoroughfare whose name first appeared in 1626 as Piccadilly Hall, named after a house belonging to one Robert Baker, a tailor famous for selling piccadills, or piccadillies, a term used for various kinds of collars. The street was known as Portugal Street in 1692 in honour of Catherine of Braganza, the queen consort of King Charles II but was known as Piccadilly by 1743. Piccadilly Circus was created in 1819, at the junction with Regent Street, which was then being built under the planning of John Nash on the site of a house and garden belonging to a Lady Hutton; the intersection was then known as Regent Circus South (just as Oxford Circus was known as Regent Circus North) and it did not begin to be known as Piccadilly Circus until the mid 1880s, with the rebuilding of the Regent Street Quadrant and the construction of Shaftesbury Avenue. In the same period the circus lost its circular form.

The junction has been a very busy traffic interchange since construction, as it lies at the centre of Theatreland and handles exit traffic from Piccadilly, which Charles Dickens Jr. described in 1879: &quot;Piccadilly, the great thoroughfare leading from the Haymarket and Regent-street westward to Hyde Park-corner, is the nearest approach to the Parisian boulevard of which London can boast.&quot;

Piccadilly Circus tube station was opened on 10 March 1906, on the Bakerloo line, and on the Piccadilly line in December of that year. In 1928, the station was extensively rebuilt to handle an increase in traffic. The junction&#x27;s first electric advertisements appeared in 1910, and, from 1923, electric billboards were set up on the facade of the London Pavilion. Electric street lamps, however, did not replace the gas ones until 1932. The circus became a one-way roundabout on 19 July 1926. Traffic lights were first installed on 3 August 1926.

During World War II many servicemen&#x27;s clubs in the West End served American soldiers based in Britain. So many prostitutes roamed the area approaching the soldiers that they received the nickname &quot;Piccadilly Commandos&quot;, and both Scotland Yard and the Foreign Office discussed possible damage to Anglo-American relations.
At the start of the 1960s, it was determined that the Circus needed to be redeveloped to allow for greater traffic flow. In 1962, Lord Holford presented a plan which would have created a &quot;double-decker&quot; Piccadilly Circus; the upper deck would have been an elevated pedestrian concourse linking the buildings around the perimeter of the Circus, with the lower deck being solely for traffic, most of the ground-level pedestrian areas having been removed to allow for greater vehicle flow. This concept was kept alive throughout the rest of the 1960s. A final scheme in 1972 proposed three octagonal towers (the highest tall) to replace the Trocadero, the Criterion and the &quot;Monico&quot; buildings. The plans were permanently rejected by Sir Keith Joseph and Ernest Marples; the key reason given was that Holford&#x27;s scheme only allowed for a 20% increase in traffic, and the Government required 50%.
The Holford plan is referenced in the short-form documentary film &quot;Goodbye, Piccadilly&quot;, produced by the Rank Organisation in 1967 as part of their &quot;Look at Life&quot; series when it was still seriously expected that Holford&#x27;s recommendations would be acted upon. Piccadilly Circus has since escaped major redevelopment, apart from extensive ground-level pedestrianisation around its south side in the 1980s.
The Circus has been targeted by Irish republican terrorists multiple times. On 24 June 1939 an explosion occurred, although no injuries were caused. On 25 November 1974 a bomb injured 16 people. A 2 lb bomb exploded on 6 October 1992, injuring five people.

The Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain at Piccadilly Circus was erected in 1893 to commemorate the philanthropic works of Anthony Ashley Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury. It was removed from the Circus twice and moved from the centre once. The first time was in 1922, so that Charles Holden&#x27;s new tube station could be built directly below it. The fountain returned in 1931. During the Second World War, the fountain was removed for the second time and replaced by advertising hoardings. It was returned again in 1948. When the Circus underwent reconstruction work in the late 1980s, the entire fountain was moved from the centre of the junction at the beginning of Shaftesbury Avenue to its present position at the southwestern corner.

==Location and sights==
Piccadilly Circus is surrounded by tourist attractions, including the Shaftesbury Memorial, Criterion Theatre, London Pavilion and retail stores. Nightclubs, restaurants and bars are located in the area and neighbouring Soho, including the former Chinawhite club.
===Illuminated signs===
Piccadilly Circus was surrounded by illuminated advertising hoardings on buildings, starting in 1908 with a Perrier sign, but only one building now carries them, the one in the northwestern corner between Shaftesbury Avenue and Glasshouse Street. The site is unnamed (usually referred to as &quot;Monico&quot; after the Café Monico, which used to be on the site); its addresses are 44/48 Regent Street, 1/6 Sherwood Street, 17/22 Denman Street and 1/17 Shaftesbury Avenue, and it has been owned by property investor Land Securities Group since the 1970s.

The earliest signs used incandescent light bulbs; these were replaced with neon lights and with moving signs (there was a large Guinness clock at one time). The first Neon sign was for the British meat extract Bovril. From December 1998, digital projectors were used for the Coke sign, the square&#x27;s first digital billboard, while in the 2000s there was a gradual move to LED displays, which completely replaced neon lamps by 2011. The number of signs has reduced over the years as the rental costs have increased, and in January 2017 the six remaining advertising screens were switched off as part of their combination into one large ultra-high definition curved Daktronics display, turning the signs off during renovation for the longest time since the 1940s. On 26 October 2017, the new screen was switched on for the first time.

Until the 2017 refurbishment, the site had six LED advertising screens above three large retail units facing Piccadilly Circus on the north side, occupied by Boots, Gap and a mix of smaller retail, restaurant and office premises fronting the other streets. A Burger King located under the Samsung advert, which had been a Wimpy Bar until 1989, closed in early 2008 and was converted into a Barclays Bank.
*Coca-Cola has had a sign at Piccadilly Circus since 1954. In September 2003, the previous digital projector board and the site that had been occupied by Nescafé was replaced with a state-of-the-art LED video display that curves round with the building. Before Nescafé, a neon advertisement for Foster&#x27;s occupied the spot from 1987 until 1999, and from 1978 to 1987 it was used by Philips Electronics. For several months in 2002, the Nescafé sign was replaced by a sign featuring the quote &quot;Imagine all the people living life in peace&quot; by Beatle John Lennon. This was paid for by his widow Yoko Ono, who spent an estimated £150,000 to display an advert at this location. Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Coca-Cola Zero, Fanta, Sprite and Vitamin Water have all been advertised in the space. 
*Hyundai Motors sign launched on 29 September 2011. It replaced a sign for Sanyo which had occupied the space since around early 1988 (slightly modified in 2004), the last to be run using neon lights rather than Hyundai&#x27;s computerised LED screen. Earlier Sanyo signs with older logos had occupied the position since 1978, although these were only half the size of the later space.
*McDonald&#x27;s added its sign in 1987, replacing one for BASF. The sign was changed from neon to LED in 2001. A bigger, brighter screen was installed by Daktronics in 2008.
*Samsung added its sign in November 1994, the space having been previously occupied by Canon Inc. (1978–84) and Panasonic (1984–94). The sign was changed from neon to LED in summer 2005. The screen was upgraded and improved in autumn 2011.
*L&#x27;Oreal, Hunter Original and eBay both had signs in the Piccadilly circus billboards since October 2017. 
*One Piccadilly, the highest resolution of all the LED displays was installed by Daktronics, in late 2013, underneath the Samsung and McDonald&#x27;s signs. It allowed other companies to advertise for both short- and long-term leases, increasing the amount of advertising space but using the same screen for multiple brands. Prior to this an earlier, smaller LED screen called &quot;Piccadilly Lite&quot; occupied the space from 3 December 2007 to 2013. The space has also been occupied by JVC (1978–84), Carlsberg (1984–2003) and Budweiser (2003–07).
*The Curve, a similar space to One Piccadilly, was added in 2015, replacing a space previously occupied by Schweppes (1920–61), BP (1961–67), Cinzano (1967–78), Fujifilm (1978–86), Kodak (1986–90) and TDK (1990–2015). Burberry was using the space as of December 2015.
*LG was added in February 2007 on the roof of Coventry House, which diagonally faces Piccadilly Circus. Its sign is a large LED video advertising display for LGE, the British arm of the South Korean electronics group. The new display also incorporates a scrolling ticker of Sky News headlines. Before LG, Vodafone had a neon sign installed on that spot, which displayed both its logo and personal messages that could be submitted on a special website and displayed at a certain time and date.

On special occasions the lights are switched off, such as the deaths of Winston Churchill in 1965 and Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997. On 21 June 2007, they were switched off for one hour as part of the Lights Out London campaign. After the death of Elizabeth II, all advertising on Piccadilly Circus was replaced with an image honouring the Queen, as part of a suspension of out-of-home advertising agreed upon by the industry.

Other companies and brands that have had signs on the site were Bovril, Volkswagen, Max Factor, Wrigley&#x27;s Spearmint, Skol, Air India and Gold Flake (as Will&#x27;s Gold Flake Cigarettes).

Since 2020, the Cultural Institute of Radical Contemporary Arts has broadcast specially commissioned two-minute artworks for the screens, broadcast at the same time each evening. In 2022 the segments were shown at 8:22 p.m.

===Shaftesbury Memorial and the statue of Anteros===

At the south-eastern side of the Circus, moved after World War II from its original position in the centre, stands the Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain, erected in 1892–1893 to commemorate the philanthropic works of Lord Shaftesbury, a Victorian politician, philanthropist and social reformer. The subject of the Memorial is the Greek god Anteros and was given the name &quot;The Angel of Christian Charity&quot; but is generally mistaken for his brother Eros.

===Criterion Theatre===

The Criterion Theatre, a Grade II* listed building, stands on the south side of Piccadilly Circus. Apart from the box office area, the entire theatre, with nearly 600 seats, is underground and is reached by descending a tiled stairway. Columns are used to support both the dress circle and the upper circle, restricting the views of many of the seats inside.

The theatre was designed by Thomas Verity and opened as a theatre on 21 March 1874, although original plans were for it to become a concert hall. In 1883, it was forced to close to improve ventilation and to replace gaslights with electric lights and was reopened the following year. The theatre closed in 1989 and was extensively renovated, reopening in October 1992.

===London Pavilion===
On the north-eastern side of Piccadilly Circus, on the corner between Shaftesbury Avenue and Coventry Street, is the London Pavilion. The first building bearing the name was built in 1859 and was a music hall. In 1885, Shaftesbury Avenue was built through the former site of the Pavilion, and a new London Pavilion was constructed, which also served as a music hall. In 1924 electric billboards were erected on the side of the building.

In 1934, the building underwent significant structural alteration and was converted into a cinema. In 1986, the building was rebuilt, preserving the 1885 façade, and converted into a shopping arcade. In 2000, the building was connected to the neighbouring Trocadero Centre, and signage on the building was altered in 2003 to read &quot;London Trocadero&quot;. The basement of the building connects with the Underground station.

===Major shops===

The former Swan &amp; Edgar department store on the west side of the circus between Piccadilly and Regent Street was built in 1928–29 to a design by Reginald Blomfield. Since the closure of the department store in the early 1980s, the building has been successively the flagship London store of music chains Tower Records, Virgin Megastore and Zavvi.

Lillywhites is a major retailer of sporting goods located on the corner of the circus and Lower Regent Street, next to the Shaftesbury fountain. It moved to its present site in 1925. Lillywhites is popular with tourists, and they regularly offer sale items, including international football jerseys up to 90% off. Nearby Fortnum &amp; Mason is often considered to be part of the Piccadilly Circus shopping area and is known for its expansive food hall.

===County Fire Office===

Dominating the north side of the circus, on the corner of Glasshouse Street, is the County Fire Office building, with a statue of Britannia on the roof. The original building was designed by John Nash as the extreme southern end of his Regent Street Quadrant. Its dramatic façade was clearly influenced by Inigo Jones&#x27;s old Somerset House. Although Robert Abraham was the County Fire Insurance Company&#x27;s architect, it was probably Nash who was instrumental in choosing the design. In 1924 the old County Fire Office was demolished and replaced with a similar but much coarser building designed by Reginald Blomfield, but retaining the statue of Britannia. During the London Blitz it was the only building in the Circus to be damaged, with a few window panes blown out. The building is Grade II listed.

==Underground station and the Bakerloo and Piccadilly lines==

The Piccadilly Circus station on the London Underground is located directly beneath Piccadilly Circus itself, with entrances at every corner. It is one of the few stations which have no associated buildings above ground and is fully underground. The below ground concourse and subway entrances are Grade II listed.

The station is on the Piccadilly line between Green Park and Leicester Square, and the Bakerloo line between Charing Cross and Oxford Circus.

==Demonstrations==

The Circus&#x27; status as a high-profile public space has made it the destination for numerous political demonstrations, including the February 15, 2003 anti-war protest and the &quot;Carnival Against Capitalism&quot; protest against the 39th G8 summit in 2013.

==In popular culture==
The phrase &quot;it&#x27;s like Piccadilly Circus&quot; is commonly used in the UK to refer to a place or situation which is extremely busy with people. It has been said that a person who stays long enough at Piccadilly Circus will eventually bump into everyone they know. Probably because of this connection, during World War II, &quot;Piccadilly Circus&quot; was the code name given to the Allies&#x27; D-Day invasion fleet&#x27;s assembly location in the English Channel.

Piccadilly Circus has inspired artists and musicians. &quot;Piccadilly Circus&quot; (1912) is the name and subject of a painting by British artist Charles Ginner, part of the Tate Britain collection. Sculptor Paul McCarthy also has a 320-page two-volume edition of video stills by the name of &quot;Piccadilly Circus&quot;. In the lyrics of their song &quot;Mother Goose&quot;, on the &quot;Aqualung&quot; album from 1971, the band Jethro Tull tells &quot;And a foreign student said to me: &#x27;was it really true there were elephants, lions too, in Picadilly Circus?&#x27;&quot;. Bob Marley mentioned Piccadilly Circus in his song &quot;Kinky Reggae&quot;, on the &quot;Catch a Fire&quot; album from 1973.

L. S. Lowry R.A painting &quot;Piccadilly Circus, London&quot; (1960), part of Lord Charles Forte&#x27;s collection for almost three decades, sold for £5,641,250 when auctioned for the first time at Christie&#x27;s 20th Century British &amp; Irish Art sale on 16 November 2011. Contemporary British painter Carl Randall&#x27;s painting &#x27;Piccadilly Circus&#x27; (2017) is a large monochrome canvas depicting the area at night with crowds, the making of which involved painting over 70 portraits from life.

<doc id="229189" wikidata="Q1123106" url="?curid=229189" title="Regent Street">
<text>Regent Street is a major shopping street in the West End of London. It is named after George, the Prince Regent (later George IV) and was laid out under the direction of the architect John Nash and James Burton. It runs from Waterloo Place in St James&#x27;s at the southern end, through Piccadilly Circus and Oxford Circus, to All Souls Church. From there Langham Place and Portland Place continue the route to Regent&#x27;s Park.

The street&#x27;s layout was completed in 1825 and was an early example of town planning in England, replacing earlier roads including Swallow Street. Nash and Burton&#x27;s street layout has survived, although all the original buildings except All Souls Church have been replaced following reconstruction in the late 19th century. The street is known for its flagship retail stores, including Liberty, Hamleys, Jaeger and the Apple Store. The Royal Polytechnic Institution, now the University of Westminster, has been based on Regent Street since 1838.

==Route==
Regent Street is approximately long and begins at a junction with Charles II Street as a continuation of Waterloo Place. It runs north to Piccadilly Circus, where it turns left before curving round the Quadrant to head north again, meeting Oxford Street at Oxford Circus. It ends at a junction with Cavendish Place and Mortimer Street near the BBC Broadcasting House, with the road ahead being Langham Place, followed by Portland Place.

The southern section of the road is one-way northbound and part of the A4, a major road through West London. From Piccadilly Circus northwards, it is numbered A4201, though in common with roads inside the London congestion charging zone, the number does not appear on signs.

Nearby tube stations are Charing Cross, Piccadilly Circus and Oxford Circus; the lattermost being one of the busiest underground stations in London, and is where three main lines (Central, Bakerloo and Victoria) meet. Several bus routes, such as 6, 12, and 13, run along Regent Street.

==History==

===Beginnings: 1811–1825===

Regent Street was one of the first planned developments of London. An ordered structure of London streets, replacing the mediaeval layout, had been planned since just after the Great Fire of London (1666) when Sir Christopher Wren and John Evelyn drew plans for rebuilding the city on the classical formal model. After a lack of progress, houses were rebuilt on the old street network anyway.

In 1766, John Gwynn complained in &quot;London and Westminster Improved&quot; that there was a lack of planning throughout the West End and that it would be useful to construct a thoroughfare linking Marylebone Park (now Regent&#x27;s Park) with the Prince Regent&#x27;s Carlton House. John Fordyce was appointed as Surveyor-General to the First Commissioner of Woods and Forests in 1793 and concluded that there should be a suitable road in place by 1811, when the lease for Marylebone Park ran out and ownership reverted to the Crown. It was hoped the road could link Pall Mall and the Haymarket, which had declined and became downmarket. A further problem was increased congestion around Charing Cross, which would benefit from road improvements.

The street was designed by John Nash (who had been appointed to the Office of Woods and Forests in 1806 and previously served as an adviser to the Prince Regent) and by developer James Burton. Nash proposed his own plans for the street in 1810 following the death of Fordyce, envisioning broad, architecturally distinguished thoroughfares and public spaces, and planned to construct a straight boulevard as seen in French cities, but this was not possible because of land ownership issues. Nash&#x27;s final design resulted in a road situated further west than on previous plans, and Nash believed the road would run down a &quot;de facto&quot; line separating the upper classes and nobility in Mayfair with the working class in Soho. 
The construction of the northern section of the New Street involved demolishing most of the existing Swallow Street, which had become run down and was an ideal candidate for regeneration. The road was designed to curve east between Oxford Street and Piccadilly so that it did not meet St James&#x27;s Square, and the circuses allowed visual continuity down the street. The central section, known as the Quadrant, was designed for &quot;shops appropriated to articles of fashion and taste,&quot; and was Nash&#x27;s centrepiece for the street. It was built with a colonnade of cast-iron columns, allowing commuters to walk along the street without having to face bad weather. The buildings along the Quadrant had different facades, a deliberate choice by Nash to break away from the uniform design of the previous century and a pragmatic means of using what building materials were available and what clients wanted. The road was planned to end outside Carlton House in Pall Mall, the residence of the Prince of Wales. Nash insisted that businesses on the street would be of high-quality to rival nearby Bond Street; common trades such as butchers or greengrocers were not allowed.

The design was adopted by an act of Parliament, the (53 Geo. 3. c. 121), which permitted the commissioners to borrow £600,000 for building and construction. The street was intended for commercial purposes and it was expected that most of the income would come from private capital. Nash took responsibility for design and valuation of all properties. Construction of the road required demolishing numerous properties, disrupting trade and polluting the air with dust. Existing tenants had first offer to purchase leases on the new properties. The Treasury supported the proposal because, in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, there was an urgent need for the government to create jobs. Government expenditure was low because the design relied heavily on private developers, such as Nash himself. The buildings were let on 99-year leases, as was common at the time, and income could be recouped in the form of ground rent.

===James Burton===
James Burton, the pre-eminent Georgian London property developer, designed and constructed 191 of the houses of Regent Street, and their joining archways. Five of the largest blocks of Regent Street were purchased by Burton in 1817. Burton&#x27;s houses on Regent Street are No. 4 to No. 12; No. 17 to No. 25; No. 106 to No. 128; No. 132 to No. 154; No. 133 to No. 167; No. 171 to No. 195; and No. 295 to No. 319. These were built, together with Carlton Chambers, between 1817 and 1820. Burton also built between Leicester Street and No. 129 Swallow Street in 1820. Burton built the east side of Regent Street in 1821, and the west side of Regent Street, specifically the part between the Quadrant and Oxford Street, and its archways, in 1822. Burton built north of Old Burlington Street, and the east side of the street between Chapel Court and the entrance to the King Street Chapel SW1, in 1822. Burton also designed and built Regent Street St. James (Lower Regent Street), and Waterloo Place, St. James&#x27;s, whose facades he modelled on those of the Place Vendome in Paris, between 1815 and 1816.

===Other architects===
The vast majority of the street was designed by Nash or Burton. However, a few buildings were designed by Charles Robert Cockerell, Sir John Soane, or others. By 1819, the Crown was receiving regular rent and the street was becoming established. At first, it was named New Street and became a dividing line between Soho, which had declined socially and economically, and the fashionable squares and streets of Mayfair to the west. Carlton House was demolished after completion of the works in 1829 and was replaced by Carlton House Terrace, designed by Nash and the son of James Burton, Decimus Burton. Regent Street was the first shopping area in Britain to support late night opening in 1850, when shopkeepers agreed to keep stores open until 7pm.

===Rebuilding: 1895–1927===

During the 19th century, Regent Street became established as the &quot;centre of fashion&quot;. Shops expanded into multiple properties, selling imported and exotic products to appeal to niche consumers. By the end of the century, fashions had changed and the original buildings were small and old fashioned, restricting trade. The colonnade constructed by Nash was demolished in the mid-19th century for fear it might attract &quot;doubtful characters&quot;. Other buildings were not up to modern building standards; some had been extended and were structurally suspect. As the 99-year leases came to an end, Regent Street was redeveloped between 1895 and 1927 under the control of the Office of Woods, Forests and Land Revenues (now known as the Crown Estate).

The modern Regent Street is the result of this redevelopment. No original structures survive except south of Oxford Circus for some Nash-designed sewers. The current design is an example of the Beaux Arts approach to urban design: an assembly of separate buildings on a grand scale, designed to harmonise and produce an impressive overall effect. Strict rules governed the reconstruction. Each block had to be designed with a continuous unifying street façade and finished in Portland stone. The first redevelopment was Regent House, just south of Oxford Circus. The stylistic tone for the rebuilding was set by Sir Reginald Blomfield&#x27;s Quadrant.

The architect Norman Shaw, then aged 73, was brought in to draw up proposals for the Circus and the Quadrant after early plans were considered unsatisfactory. His scheme was approved in principle but subject to indecision and dispute, both on property acquisition and retailers&#x27; demand for bigger display windows. Shaw&#x27;s design for the Piccadilly Hotel was completed in 1908 with modifications, while the Quadrant was rebuilt by Blomfield, adapting Shaw&#x27;s designs. The work started in 1923 and was completed by 1928. Significantly, no accommodation was built above any of the retail properties, contributing to the demise of the West End as a place of residence. A limited number of architects were responsible for the redesigned street, including Sir John James Burnet, Arthur Joseph Davis and Henry Tanner.

The Work was delayed by World War I and not finished until 1927. Its completion was marked by King George V and Queen Mary driving in state along its length. The only remaining Nash building is All Souls Church and all the buildings on the street are at least Grade II listed. All the properties are in the Regent Street Conservation Area.

Meanwhile, the Bakerloo line of the London Underground was built running under the street for part of its course from 1902 until 1906, when it was opened on 10 March that year. The line&#x27;s entrance at Oxford Circus tube station, near Argyll Street, was designed by Leslie W. Green using glazed terracotta as a facing material.

===Crown Estate redevelopment===
By the 1970s, Regent Street had started to decline because of under-investment and competition from neighbouring areas such as Oxford Street or shopping centres away from Central London. In 2002, the Crown Estate, which owns most of Regent Street on behalf of the monarch, started a major redevelopment programme. In 2013 the Estate sold a quarter of the Regent Street Quadrant 3 building to the Norwegian Oil Fund, while later that year, Hackett London bought the lease for the Ferrari store on Regent Street for £4m. Smaller shops have been replaced by larger units; the street is now the flagship location of several major brands, including Apple and Banana Republic.

The largest part of the plan was the reconstruction of the Quadrant close to Piccadilly Circus, which was completed in 2011. It offers of office space spanning over seven floors. Two Art Deco-designed restaurants have also been restored, and the development includes a small number of apartments.
The Crown Estate moved its own headquarters from Carlton House Terrace to Regent Street in 2006.

==Properties==

===Retail===

The department store Dickins and Jones was established at No. 54 Oxford Street as Dickins and Smith before moving to Nos. 232–234 Regent Street in 1835. It was renamed to Dickins and Jones in the 1890s after John Pritchard Jones became a business partner, and by the turn of the 20th century employed over 200 people. It became part of the Harrods group in 1914, and expanded to cover Nos. 224–244 in 1922, in a new building designed by Sir Henry Tanner. In 1959, House of Fraser took over the store by buying the Harrods group. In 2005, House of Fraser announced that the store would close the following year, after it had been making a loss for several years and not kept up with more fashion-conscious department stores elsewhere. The building has been redeveloped with small shop units on the lower floors and flats and offices above.
The Liberty department store is based at Nos. 210–220. It was founded by entrepreneur Arthur Lasenby Liberty, who had been inspired by the 1862 International Exhibition and wanted to open an oriental warehouse. He opened his first shop, East India House in 1875 at No. 218a, selling silk garments and various oriental goods. The shop expanded into other properties on Regent Street in the 1880s, separated by a jeweller&#x27;s shop which was bridged by a double staircase called the &quot;Camel&#x27;s Back&quot;. Liberty later took over all of Nos. 140–150 Regent Street. In 1925, this complex was replaced by two new buildings, and a mock tudor building (built by architects Edwin T. Hall and his son Edwin S. Hall, constructed from the timbers of two ships, , and on neighbouring Great Marlborough Street connected by a footbridge over Kingly Street, which separates the properties.
The toy store Hamleys is at No. 188 Regent Street, just south of Oxford Circus. It was founded as Noah&#x27;s Ark at No. 231 High Holborn in 1760. An additional branch opened at Nos. 64–66 Regent Street in 1881, while the original High Holborn building burned down in 1901, moving to Nos. 86–87. The store was frequently the first to market the latest games and toys, and became a strong seller of table tennis equipment in the late 19th century, allowing the sport to become popular. The business moved to Nos. 200–202, and moved to the current address in 1981. It claims to be the largest toy shop in the world.

The main London branch of the clothing store Jaeger was at Nos. 200–206 Regent Street. It was founded in 1884 by Lewis Tomalin, who was inspired by naturalist Gustav Jäger&#x27;s pioneering use of anti-animal fibre-based clothing. The first shop, on Fore Street, had &quot;Doctor Jaeger&#x27;s Sanitary Woollen System&quot; inscribed above the door. Oscar Wilde was a regular visitor to the shop. Henry Morton Stanley is known to have worn Jaeger clothing during his search for David Livingstone in Africa, as is Robert Falcon Scott on his fated trip to the South Pole. The company moved to Regent Street in 1935; it moved out in January 2016.
The Apple Store opened on Regent Street on 20 November 2004. At the time, this was the first such store in Europe, with the others being in the United States and Japan. It was the largest Apple store worldwide until the opening of an even larger store in Covent Garden in August 2010.
The building that houses the store is a grade II listed building built in 1898 for Venetian mosaicist Antonio Salviati.
Austin Reed&#x27;s flagship store was at Nos. 103–113 Regent Street for more than 85 years, having moved there in 1911. It had an atrium at its centre, housing glass lifts allowing viewing across all floors. The lower ground floor sold womenswear and also housed Austin&#x27;s, the refurbished Art Deco Barber Shop. In May 2011, the British fashion retailer Superdry announced it would move into the building, paying £12m for the lease. In return, Austin Reed moved to the former Aquascutum shop on the other side of the road. In 2016, Austin Reed filed for administration, ending over 100 years&#x27; presence on Regent Street.

Aquascutum, first established in Mayfair in 1851, opened its flagship store at 100 Regent Street in 1895. It closed on 7 August 2011. Swan and Edgar moved their haberdashery business into the newly-developed Regent Street in the 1820s; they first opened at number 49, and by 1848 had expanded into 45-51. The premises, which included a prominent frontage on Piccadilly Circus, were rebuilt by Sir Reginald Blomfield in 1910-20. The department store closed down in 1982.

Hedges and Butler, wine and spirits merchant established in 1667, moved into 153 Regent Street in 1819 and stayed there for a little under 200 years. Since 2014 the premises have been occupied by Watches of Switzerland.

===Broadcasting===

Immediately north of Regent Street is the BBC&#x27;s headquarters, Broadcasting House, whose front entrance is in Langham Place. Several national radio stations are broadcast from this building. The site had formerly been a building on the gardens of Foley House designed by James Wyatt and called Wyatt&#x27;s House. It was demolished in 1928 (with much of the fixtures ending up in the Victoria and Albert Museum) to construct Broadcasting House. Construction was challenging because the building had to be visually similar to other properties on Regent Street, yet also contain over twenty soundproofed studios. The exterior is built of Portland stone and above the front entrance is a sculpture by Eric Gill.

Broadcasting House was first used by the BBC on 2 May 1932, and total construction costs were £350,000. It was too small for all services, and St George&#x27;s Hall, next to All Souls, was used for variety broadcasts until it was demolished during the Blitz. On 15 October 1940, the building took a direct hit, killing seven people, and later that year a landmine exploded on Portland Place, causing widespread fires in Broadcasting House. Despite the damage, it survived the war and became one of the best known buildings associated with radio broadcasting. Subsequently, the BBC expanded with additional studios at Maida Vale, followed by the former headquarters of BBC Television, BBC Television Centre at Wood Lane. In the 2000s, Broadcasting House was expanded to include a new wing and modernise the site, replacing earlier extensions. It was designed by MacCormac Jamieson Prichard. Originally named the Egton House, it was renamed to the John Peel Wing in 2012, in memory of the radio broadcaster.

The Paris Theatre was located in a converted cinema in Lower Regent Street, near other BBC buildings. Several rock groups performed live concerts here, including The Beatles, Queen and Pink Floyd, which were simultaneously recorded for broadcast. The BBC stopped using the theatre in 1995.

===Education===
The University of Westminster&#x27;s main campus is at No. 309 Regent Street. Founded in 1838 under the chairmanship of George Cayley, it is one of the oldest educational institutions in Central London. It began life as the Royal Polytechnic Institution (after a royal charter had been formally received in August 1839 Prince Albert became a patron to the institution). The Polytechnic closed in 1881, but was promptly re-founded by Quintin Hogg as The Polytechnic at Regent Street. In 1970 it was amalgamated with Holborn College of Law, Languages and Commerce to become the Polytechnic of Central London (PCL), which in turn became the University of Westminster in 1992. 

The university houses the Regent Street Cinema which acted as a platform for major scientists, artists and authors such as Charles Dickens, John Henry Pepper, and The Lumière Brothers (Auguste and Louis Lumière) where public and private screenings of Cinématographe were shown to an audience. The cinema was restored and reopened to the public in May 2015.

===Other===

All Souls Church is at the top of Regent Street next to Broadcasting House. It was built in 1823 out of Bath stone and consecrated in 1824, and is the only surviving building in Regent Street that was designed by John Nash.

The Café Royal, located at 68 Regent Street in the Quadrant, was opened in 1865 by Daniel Nicols and became an institution of London high society. In 1895 Oscar Wilde argued with Frank Harris in the café about his proposal to sue the Marquess of Queensberry for libel over Wilde&#x27;s alleged homosexuality. Wilde went ahead with the trial, which ultimately led to his own arrest and imprisonment. The present building, by Sir Reginald Blomfield, dates from 1928 and is Grade II listed. It was closed in 2008 and the building which houses the café was bought by a subsidiary of Alrov Group, as a part of Crown Estate&#x27;s plans to redevelop this part of Regent Street.

Veeraswamy, London&#x27;s oldest extant Indian restaurant, has been at 99-101 Regent Street since 1926.

==Events==

Regent Street is home to several events throughout the year. The Regent Street Festival happens annually, and during this time, the street is closed to traffic. In September, there is a series of fashion-related events, dubbed as Fashion and Design Month (FDM), which has been running since 2015. In an interview with David Shaw, the head of the &quot;Regent Street Portfolio&quot;, he said that for FDM 2016, they worked with many &quot;talented individuals across a variety of events, combining creative talent with our established stores.&quot;

There have been Christmas lights on Regent Street in various forms since 1882. The current regular displays date from 1948, when the Regent Street Association decorated the street with trees. Since 1954, the Regent Street Association have arranged annual Christmas lights. There is a different display every year and the switching on ceremony occurs during November.

On 6 July 2004, half a million people crowded into Regent Street and the surrounding streets to watch a parade of Formula One cars. In 2016, the sport&#x27;s chief manager, Bernie Ecclestone, speculated that a London Grand Prix may potentially happen in the future, including Regent Street as a part of the circuit.
==Cultural references==
The character Lord Frederick Verisopht in Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; lived in an apartment in Regent Street. This reflected the nature of the street in the mid-19th century when it was still a fashionable residence for the upper class.

In August 1839, the first British commercial production of daguerreotype photographs were carried out in a property on Regent Street, shortly after the process had been publicly documented.

Regent Street is a location on the British version of &quot;Monopoly&quot; as a group of three green squares with Oxford Street and Bond Street. The three properties are grouped together as they are all known for their retail and commercial backgrounds.

The Langham Hotel on Regent Street is mentioned in several of Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes stories, including &quot;The Sign of Four&quot;, &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; and &quot;The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax&quot;. In &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; (chapter 4), Holmes and Watson attempt to follow Stapleton down Regent Street.

Offshoot crescent road Heddon Street was the location for the cover photography for 1972 David Bowie album &quot;The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars&quot;. A blue plaque has been placed to mark the spot where Bowie posed for the front cover.

<text>Oxford Circus is a road junction connecting Oxford Street and Regent Street in the West End of London. It is also the entrance to Oxford Circus tube station.

The junction opened in 1819 as part of the Regent Street development under John Nash, and was originally known as Regent Circus North. After the original lease expired, it was redesigned around a series of four quadrant buildings by Henry Tanner between 1913 and 1928, the north-eastern of which has been used by Peter Robinson, Topshop, the BBC and the London Co-operative Society; these are now Grade II listed buildings.

Oxford Circus remains a busy junction for traffic, and a £5 million upgrade for pedestrians opened in 2009. It has also attracted attention as a place for demonstrations and protests, including several by Extinction Rebellion.

==History==
===19th century===

The junction was designed as part of John Nash&#x27;s work on Regent Street. Circuses had become popular in English architecture after George Dance the Younger had popularised them in the Minories in East London. Nash wanted to use extra land space so that vehicles could move around one another when turning, with a concave layout attracting shopkeepers and increasing the potential for land value. He originally intended the circus to be colonnaded, but when the New Street Bill was proposed to parliament, it was rejected, with one MP fearing the circus would &quot;be a nuisance by day and something worse by night&quot;. He redesigned the circus so that the new Regent Street would meet the established Oxford Street at a near right-angle, with a smaller diameter reducing its land intake. Parliament approved the design, passing the New Street Act 1813 (53 Geo. 3. c. 121).

Construction of the circus began in 1816, with Nash working in association with Samuel Baxter. Work was complicated by the compulsory purchase of properties along Oxford Street. Eight houses on the north side and eleven on the south were demolished to make way for the junction. To avoid legal challenges, Nash attempted to rehouse existing tenants in the new buildings around the circus wherever possible. After John Richardson, proprietor of Richardson&#x27;s silk shop on 118 Oxford Street died, Nash ensured his widow and surviving family and employees were all housed in a building on the circus&#x27;s north-eastern section. After the family complained and demanded changes, Nash worked with Baxter to try to accommodate them as much as possible.

Most buildings around the circus were designed in a more disciplined manner than some of Nash&#x27;s later work, and were based on Palladian architecture. They featured fluted Corinthian pilasters and artificial stone capitals. The pilaster order continued down Regent Street.
The circus opened officially in November 1819. It was originally known as Regent Circus North, with the corresponding Piccadilly Circus named Regent Circus South. However, unlike Piccadilly Circus, Oxford Circus had no decorations and was designed as a straightforward traffic crossing. Fellow architect James Elmes described Nash&#x27;s work on the circus as giving &quot;an air of grandeur&quot; and &quot;as elegant in form as it is useful in application&quot;. The current name began to be used around 1836.

In 1842, the MP Joseph Hume proposed a commemorative obelisk should be constructed in the middle of the circus. Construction began in December 1842, but was quickly disrupted and abandoned after the Marylebone parish vestry realised they only had authority to clean and maintain the circus, and not to construct anything on top of it. The obelisk was eventually built in 1850 at Nunhead Cemetery to a slightly different design.

In the Victorian era, mourning was elaborate and expensive. This area had mourning warehouses, selling the clothes, fabrics and accessories required for this. The most important of these was The London General Mourning Warehouse, commonly known as Jay&#x27;s. This was founded in Regent Street in 1841 and expanded north so that it occupied all of the SW quadrant of the circus by 1880.

===20th century===

The lease on the four quadrants around the interchange was due to expire in 1917, and it was determined they would need to be rebuilt. In 1904, the Commissioners of Woods and Forests outlined a plan to redevelop Regent Street, including Oxford Circus. In 1909, they invited proposals to redevelop the site. The new design was awarded in October 1910 to Henry Tanner, who saw off several rival designs, and was built in stages between 1913 and 1928. Tanner&#x27;s design was inspired by 18th-century French architecture, particularly that of Ange-Jacques Gabriel. Each quadrant was designed to be symmetrical with the others.

The south-eastern quadrant was completed first in 1913, before work stopped at the beginning of World War I. The north-western quadrant opened in May 1922 as the London premises for the Magasins du Louvre. The store was never popular and closed in 1930. The south-western quadrant followed in 1925 and the north-eastern in 1928.

The new north-eastern quadrant was originally occupied by the Peter Robinson department store. An extension to the store was added to the original quadrant building in 1924. During World War II, it was badly damaged by bombs in September 1940 but survived owing to its steel frame construction and was quickly repaired to a high standard. The BBC requisitioned part of the block and it saw significant use in overseas broadcasting during the war. It was sold to the London Co-operative Society in 1944. In 1969, the fourth floor of the Peter Robinson department store was leased by producer George Martin&#x27;s Associated Independent Recording company, which opened the first AIR Studios recording complex there the following year, with the studio operating in this location until 1991. Through a series of buyouts and mergers, Peter Robinson became Topshop, which occupied the site until 2020, after it went into liquidation. It was the flagship store of the franchise, covering four floors and attracting around 28,000 shoppers a day, half of whom would buy something.

The buildings are constructed of Portland stone with a cladding steel frame and slate roofs. They have been Grade II listed since 1973.

==Tube station==

The tube station opened on 30 July 1900 when the first section of the Central line opened. A connection to the Bakerloo line opened on 10 March 1906; the station was modified below ground to accommodate this.

For five years from 1963 as part of connecting the tube station to the Victoria line, the road surface was carried on a temporary 850-ton umbrella bridge, accommodating all four directions of travel while work continued underneath. This was dismantled on 12 April 1968. In 1976, a bomb planted by the Provisional IRA was detected at the station and successfully defused. The station was badly damaged by fire in November 1984, but there were no fatalities.
==Traffic==

Oxford Circus is one of the busiest pedestrian crossings in London. In 1924, shipbuilder Alfred Yarrow proposed building a grade-separated junction to segregate traffic, paid for by his own funds. The offer was turned down by Westminster City Council. In 1935, Westminster City Council proposed fitting pedestrian guard rails at the junction, restricting crossing in order to improve safety.

At the end of the 2000s, Oxford Circus had the highest pedestrian volumes recorded anywhere in London. At the busiest times, over 40,000 pedestrians per hour pass through the junction, including those accessing the tube station. The average traffic flow is around 2,000 vehicles per hour during the week, and the junction operates at near capacity for most of the day with regular queues, particularly west along Oxford Street. 24 bus routes pass through Oxford Circus, and over 400 buses cross the junction on an average weekday. There are bus stops within on every arm of the crossing.

In 2009, Transport for London redesigned the intersection to facilitate a pedestrian scramble. The crossing opened in November and cost around £5 million. It was inspired by street crossings in Tokyo, and opened by the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, who called the scheme &quot;a triumph for British engineering, Japanese innovation and good old fashioned common sense&quot;. The scheme added an additional of pedestrian space and removed the guard rail, adding 70% more capacity to the crossing.

==Events==

In February 1872, a tripartite arch made of flowers and decorated with flags was erected in the middle of Oxford Circus, to commemorate the Prince of Wales&#x27;s recovery from typhoid fever. Queen Victoria passed along the parade with the Prince to a crowd of cheering children.

On 20 December 1938, 50 people took part in an unemployment protest staged in Oxford Circus. Campaigners threw themselves into the road shouting &quot;We want work, we want bread&quot;, before being restrained by police.

On 1 May 2001, an anti-capitalism demonstration converging on Oxford Circus broke into violence. Police attempted to contain the crowd in the circus, but 50–60 demonstrators broke free and started destroying property and set fire to a nearby shop. Along with 3,000 others, Lois Austin was kept kettled in the circus for around 7 hours. She later appealed to the European Court of Human Rights.

On 26 March 2011, around 500,000 protested against government public service cuts in London. At Oxford Circus, they clashed with riot police.

On Black Friday, 24 November 2017, the Oxford Circus panic broke out after a fight in Oxford Circus tube station turned into a mass stampede. The area was busy and commuters and shoppers took refuge in shops. The Metropolitan Police later announced it would stand down the response.

In April 2019, the environmental group Extinction Rebellion protested by blockading Oxford Circus. Protesters chained themselves to the road, and the Metropolitan Police drafted additional police officers to help clear the area, who helped tear down a pink boat named after the environmental activist Berta Cáceres. In October, protesters erected a giant wooden pyramid structure in the centre of the circus, which had to be dismantled by a JCB.

In August 2019, a protest against the imprisonment of far-right extremist Tommy Robinson at the circus descended into violence. A man was arrested for actual bodily harm.

<text>Geoffrey Dearmer (21 March 1893 – 18 August 1996) was a British poet. He was the son of Anglican liturgist and hymnologist Percy Dearmer and the artist and writer Mabel Dearmer.

==School and university life==
Stephen Gwynn, a writer closely associated with Dearmer&#x27;s family, recorded that Dearmer had disliked school but blossomed at university:
I have seen a boy who was consistently and persistently and indomitably unhappy during all the phases of his school life, turn into a creature radiant, walking on air, swimming in felicity, from the moment that he became an undergraduate. Bliss lasted for two years and then there was trouble about exams: but Geoffrey Dearmer – for he is my example – had got as much as anyone I ever knew of the real Oxford teaching, which is given by the atmosphere and surroundings and associations and companionships of the place.

==Service in the First World War==
Dearmer served first (in 1915) with the Royal Fusiliers at Gallipoli, where his younger brother, Christopher, a pilot with RNAS, had been recently killed in action, and then with the Royal Army Service Corps on the Western Front in France. Dearmer&#x27;s mother, Mabel, died in Serbia while serving as a paramedic with a Red Cross ambulance unit, for which her husband, the Revd Percy Dearmer, was acting as chaplain.

Dearmer was appointed a lieutenant in the Royal Victorian Order (RVO).

==Civilian career==
From 1936 to 1958 Dearmer was Examiner of Plays in the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s office. Simultaneously he served as Editor of the BBC radio Children&#x27;s Hour programme. In this capacity, he wrote the introduction in 1960 for W. R. Dalzell&#x27;s &quot;Living Artists of the Eighteenth Century&quot; (Hutchinson &amp; Co., London). In 1935 his sci-fi novel &quot;They Chose to Be Birds&quot; appeared (Heinemann, London, 1935).

==Legacy==
He turned 100 in 1993. Dearmer died in 1996 at the age of 103. The Geoffrey Dearmer Award for new poets was founded in his memory in 1998.

==Poetic works==
Many of Dearmer&#x27;s war poems dealt with the overall brutality of war and violence, of which he was a direct eyewitness. These poems enjoyed a brief popularity during and immediately after World War I but were later overshadowed by the starker works of other war poets such as Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon. Dearmer&#x27;s poems were never infused with anger or despair and often revealed his unshakable Christian faith.
Dearmer was also a poet of nature. A critic who knew him well rated his garden poetry as highly as his war poems, quoting these lines as an example:

<text>The six Cello Suites, BWV 1007–1012, are suites for unaccompanied cello by Johann Sebastian Bach (1685–1750). They are some of the most frequently performed solo compositions ever written for cello. Bach most likely composed them during the period 1717–1723, when he served as &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; in Köthen. The title given on the cover of the Anna Magdalena Bach manuscript was &quot;Suites à Violoncello Solo senza Basso&quot; (Suites for cello solo without bass).

As usual in a Baroque musical suite, after the prelude which begins each suite, all the other movements are based around baroque dance types. The cello suites are structured in six movements each: prelude, allemande, courante, sarabande, two minuets or two bourrées or two gavottes, and a final gigue. Gary S. Dalkin of MusicWeb International called Bach&#x27;s cello suites &quot;among the most profound of all classical music works&quot; and Wilfrid Mellers described them in 1980 as &quot;Monophonic music wherein a man has created a dance of God&quot;.

Due to the works&#x27; technical demands, étude-like nature, and difficulty in interpretation because of the non-annotated nature of the surviving copies and the many discrepancies between them, the cello suites were little known and rarely publicly performed in the modern era until they were recorded by Pablo Casals (1876–1973) in the early 20th century. They have since been performed and recorded by many renowned cellists and have been transcribed for numerous other instruments; they are considered some of Bach&#x27;s greatest musical achievements.

==History==

An exact chronology of the suites (regarding both the order in which the suites were composed and whether they were composed before or after the solo violin sonatas) cannot be completely established. Scholars generally believe that—based on a comparative analysis of the styles of the sets of works—the cello suites arose first, effectively dating the suites earlier than 1720, the year on the title page of Bach&#x27;s autograph of the violin sonatas.

The suites were not widely known before the early 20th century. It was Pablo Casals who first began to popularize the suites, after discovering an edition by Friedrich Grützmacher (who was the first cellist to perform an entire Bach suite) in a thrift shop in Barcelona in 1889 when he was 13. Although Casals performed the suites publicly, it was not until 1936, when he was 60 years old, that he agreed to record them, beginning with Suites Nos. 2 and 3, at Abbey Road Studios in London. The other four were recorded in Paris: 1 and 6 in June 1938, and 4 and 5 in June 1939. Casals became the first to record all six suites; his recordings are still available and respected today. In 2019, the Casals recording was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry as &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

The suites have since been performed and recorded by many cellists. Yo-Yo Ma won the 1985 Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Soloist Performance for his album &quot;Six Unaccompanied Cello Suites&quot;. János Starker won the 1998 Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Soloist Performance for his fifth recording of &quot;Six Unaccompanied Cello Suites&quot;.

==Manuscript==
Unlike with Bach&#x27;s solo violin sonatas, no autograph manuscript of the Cello Suites survives, making it impossible to produce modern urtext performing editions. Analysis of secondary sources, including a hand-written copy by Bach&#x27;s second wife, Anna Magdalena, has produced presumably authentic editions, although critically deficient in the placement of slurs and other articulations, devoid of basic performance markings such as bowings and dynamics, and with spurious notes and rhythms. As a result, the texts present performers with numerous problems of interpretation.

German cellist Michael Bach has stated that he believes the manuscripts of the suites by Anna Magdalena Bach are accurate. According to his analysis, the unexpected positioning of the slurs corresponds closely to the harmonic development, which he suggests supports his theory. His position is not universally accepted. The most recent studies into the relationships among the four manuscripts show that Anna Magdalena Bach&#x27;s manuscript may not have been copied directly from her husband&#x27;s holograph but from a lost intervening source. Thus, the slurs in the Magdalena manuscript may not come from Bach himself and would not be clues to their interpretation.

Recent research has suggested that the suites were not necessarily written for the familiar cello played between the legs (&quot;da gamba&quot;), but an instrument played rather like a violin, on the shoulder (&quot;&quot;). Variations in the terminology used to refer to musical instruments during this period have led to modern confusion, and the discussion continues about what instrument &quot;Bach intended&quot;, and even whether he intended any instrument in particular. Sigiswald Kuijken and Ryo Terakado have both recorded the complete suites on this &quot;new&quot; instrument, known today as a violoncello (or viola) da spalla; reproductions of the instrument have been made by luthier Dmitry Badiarov.

=== Editions ===
The cellist Edmund Kurtz published an edition in 1983, which he based on facsimiles of the manuscript by Anna Magdalena Bach, placing them opposite each printed page. It was described as &quot;the most important edition of the greatest music ever written for the instrument&quot;. However, Kurtz chooses to follow the Magdalena text exactly, leading to differences between his and other editions, which correct what are generally considered to be textual errors in the source.

=== Arrangements ===
Bach transcribed at least one of the suites, Suite No. 5 in C minor, for lute. An autograph manuscript of this version exists as BWV 995.

Using the Bach edition prepared by cellist Johann Friedrich Dotzauer and published by Breitkopf &amp; Härtel in 1826, Robert Schumann wrote arrangements with piano accompaniment for all six Bach cello suites. Schumann&#x27;s publisher accepted his arrangements of the Bach violin sonatas in 1854, but rejected his Bach cello-suite arrangements. His only cello-suite arrangement surviving is the one for Suite No. 3, discovered in 1981 by musicologist Joachim Draheim in an 1863 transcription by cellist Julius Goltermann. It is believed that Schumann&#x27;s widow Clara Schumann, along with violinist Joseph Joachim, destroyed his Bach cello-arrangement manuscripts sometime after 1860, when Joachim declared them substandard. Writing in 2011, &quot;Fanfare&quot; reviewer James A. Altena agreed with that critique, calling the surviving Bach-Schumann cello/piano arrangement &quot;a musical duckbilled platypus, an extreme oddity of sustained interest only to 19th-century musicologists&quot;.

Joachim Raff, in 1868 while working on his own suites for solo piano and for other ensembles, made arrangements of the suites for piano solo, published from 1869 to 1871 by Rieter-Biedermann.

In 1923, Leopold Godowsky composed piano transcriptions of Suites Nos. 2, 3, and 5, in full counterpoint for solo piano, subtitling them &quot;very freely transcribed and adapted for piano&quot;.

The cello suites have been transcribed for numerous solo instruments, including the violin, viola, double bass, viola da gamba, mandolin, piano, marimba, classical guitar, recorder, flute, electric bass, horn, saxophone, clarinet, bassoon, trumpet, trombone, euphonium, tuba, ukulele, and charango. They have been transcribed and arranged for orchestra as well.

==Structure==
The suites are in six movements each, and have the following structure and order of movements.

# Prelude
# Allemande
# Courante
# Sarabande
# Galanteries: two minuets in each of Suite Nos. 1 and 2; two bourrées in each of Suite Nos. 3 and 4; two gavottes in each of Suite Nos. 5 and 6
# Gigue

Scholars believe that Bach intended the works to be considered as a systematically conceived cycle, rather than an arbitrary series of pieces. Compared to Bach&#x27;s other suite collections, the cello suites are the most consistent in order of their movements. In addition, to achieve a symmetrical design and go beyond the traditional layout, Bach inserted &quot;intermezzo&quot; or &quot;galanterie&quot; movements in the form of pairs between the sarabande and the gigue.

Only five movements in the entire set of suites are completely non-chordal, meaning that they consist only of a single melodic line. These are the second minuet of Suite No. 1, the second minuet of Suite No. 2, the second bourrée of Suite No. 3, the gigue of Suite No. 4, and the sarabande of Suite No. 5. The second gavotte of Suite No. 5 has but one unison chord (the same note played on two strings at the same time), but only in the original scordatura version of the suite; in the standard tuning version it is completely free of chords.

===Suite No. 1 in G major, BWV 1007===
The prelude, mainly consisting of arpeggiated chords, is the best known movement from the entire set of suites and is regularly heard on television and in films.

# Prelude
# Allemande
# Courante
# Sarabande
# Minuet I / II
# Gigue

===Suite No. 2 in D minor, BWV 1008===
The Prelude consists of two parts, the first of which has a strong recurring theme that is immediately introduced in the beginning. The second part is a scale-based cadenza movement that leads to the final, powerful chords. The subsequent allemande contains short cadenzas that stray away from this otherwise very strict dance form. The first minuet contains demanding chord shiftings and string crossings.

# Prelude
# Allemande
# Courante
# Sarabande
# Minuet I / II
# Gigue
===Suite No. 3 in C major, BWV 1009===
The Prelude of this suite consists of an A–B–A–C form, with A being a scale-based movement that eventually dissolves into an energetic arpeggio part; and B, a section of demanding chords. It then returns to the scale theme, and ends with a powerful and surprising chord movement.

The allemande is the only movement in the suites that has an up-beat consisting of three semiquavers instead of just one, which is the standard form.

The second bourrée, though in C minor, has a two-flat (or G minor) key signature. This notation, common in pre-Classical music, is sometimes known as a partial key signature. The first and second bourrée of the 3rd Suite are sometimes used as solo material for other bass instruments such as the tuba, euphonium, trombone and bassoon.

# Prelude
# Allemande
# Courante
# Sarabande
# Bourrée I / II
# Gigue
===Suite No. 4 in E major, BWV 1010===
Suite No. 4 is one of the most technically demanding of the suites, as E is an uncomfortable key on the cello and requires many extended left hand positions. The key is also difficult on cello due to the lack of resonant open strings. The prelude primarily consists of a difficult flowing quaver movement that leaves room for a cadenza before returning to its original theme.

The very peaceful sarabande is quite obscure about the stressed second beat, which is the basic characteristic of the dance, since, in this particular sarabande, almost every first beat contains a chord, whereas the second beat most often does not.

# Prelude
# Allemande
# Courante
# Sarabande
# Bourrée I / II
# Gigue

===Suite No. 5 in C minor, BWV 1011===
Suite No. 5 was originally written in scordatura with the A-string tuned down to G, but nowadays a version for standard tuning is included in almost every printed edition of the suites along with the original version. Some chords must be simplified when playing with standard tuning, but some melodic lines become easier as well.

The Prelude is written in an A–B form, and is a French overture. It begins with a slow, emotional movement that explores the deep range of the cello. After that comes a fast and very demanding single-line fugue that leads to the powerful end.

This suite is most famous for its intimate sarabande, which is one of the few movements in the six suites that does not contain any double stops (chords). Mstislav Rostropovich described it as the essence of Bach&#x27;s genius. Paul Tortelier viewed it as an extension of silence. Rostropovich, extending Tortelier&#x27;s &quot;silence&quot; to an extreme, would sometimes play the Sarabande as a recital encore at a metronome marking of 32 or slower, one note per beat, with no vibrato and no slurs, each note standing alone in a &quot;well of silence&quot;. Yo-Yo Ma played this movement on September 11, 2002 at the site of the World Trade Center, while the names of the dead were read on the first anniversary of remembrance of those lost in the September 11 attacks.

The 5th Suite is also exceptional as its courante and gigue are in the French style, rather than in the Italian form of the other five suites.

An autograph manuscript of Bach&#x27;s lute version of this suite exists as BWV 995.

# Prelude
# Allemande
# Courante
# Sarabande
# Gavotte I / II
# Gigue
===Suite No. 6 in D major, BWV 1012===
It is widely believed that Suite No. 6 was composed specifically for a five-stringed violoncello piccolo, a smaller cello, roughly normal cello size with a fifth upper string tuned to E, a perfect fifth above the otherwise top string. However, some say there is no substantial evidence to support this claim: whilst three of the sources inform the player that it is written for an instrument &quot;à cinq cordes&quot;, only Anna Magdalena Bach&#x27;s manuscript indicates the tunings of the strings, and the other sources do not mention any intended instrument at all.

Other possible instruments for the suite include a cello da spalla, a version of the violoncello piccolo played on the shoulder like a viola, as well as a viola with a fifth string tuned to E, called a viola pomposa. As the range required in this piece is very large, the suite was probably intended for a larger instrument, although it is conceivable that Bach—who was fond of the viola—may have performed the work himself on an arm-held violoncello piccolo. However, it is equally likely that beyond hinting the number of strings, Bach did not intend any specific instrument at all as the construction of instruments in the early 18th century was highly variable.

Cellists playing this suite on a modern four-string cello encounter difficulties as they are forced to use very high positions to reach many of the notes. Performers specialising in early music and using authentic instruments generally use the five-string cello for this suite. The approach of Watson Forbes, in his transcription of this suite for viola, was to transpose the entire suite to G major, avoiding &quot;a tone colour which is not very suitable for this type of music&quot; and making most of the original chords playable on a four-stringed instrument.

This suite is written in much more free form than the others, containing more cadenza-like movements and virtuosic passages. It is also the only one of the suites that is partly notated in the alto and soprano clefs (modern editions use tenor and treble clefs), which are not needed for the others since they never go above the note G4 (G above middle C).

Mstislav Rostropovich called Suite No. 6 &quot;a symphony for solo cello&quot; and characterised its D major tonality as evoking joy and triumph.

==Speculations about Anna Magdalena Bach==
Professor Martin Jarvis of Charles Darwin University School of Music, in Darwin, Australia, speculated in 2006 that Anna Magdalena may have been the composer of several musical pieces attributed to her husband. Jarvis proposes that Anna Magdalena wrote the six Cello Suites and was involved in composing the aria from the &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot; (BWV 988). 
Musicologists, critics, and performers, however, pointing to the thinness of evidence of this proposition, and the extant evidence that supports Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s authorship, remain skeptical of the claim.

<text>Oxford Street is a major road in the City of Westminster in the West End of London, running between Tottenham Court Road and Marble Arch. It marks the notional boundary between the areas of Fitzrovia and Marylebone to the north, with Soho and Mayfair to its immediate south. It is Europe&#x27;s busiest shopping street, with around half a million daily visitors, and had approximately 300 shops. It is designated as part of the A40, a major road between London and Fishguard, though it is not signed as such, and traffic is regularly restricted to buses and taxis.

The road was originally part of the Via Trinobantina, a Roman road between Essex and Hampshire via London. It was known as Tyburn Road through the Middle Ages when it was notorious for public hangings of prisoners at Tyburn Gallows. It became known as Oxford Road and then Oxford Street in the 18th century and began to change from residential to commercial and retail use, attracting street traders, confidence tricksters, and prostitution. Department stores began to dominate the streetscape in the early 20th century, the most imposing of all being Selfridges (which opened in 1909). The street suffered heavy bombing during World War II, and several longstanding stores including John Lewis &amp; Partners were completely destroyed and rebuilt from scratch.

Despite competition from out-of-town shopping centres and online retailers, Oxford Street remains in high demand as a retail location, with many British retail chains having their flagship stores on the street, and having a number of listed buildings. Unlike nearby shopping streets such as Bond Street, it has retained an element of downmarket trading alongside more prestigious retail stores. Generally speaking, the eastern end of Oxford Street features a higher proportion of more downmarket retailers, fast food restaurants, and souvenir shops whilst more exclusive and upmarket stores can be found towards its western end which passes close to the wealthy Mayfair district. Some of Tottenham Court Road&#x27;s famous electronics stores have spread onto its eastern extremity. 

The annual switching on of Christmas lights by a celebrity has been a popular event since 1959. As a popular retail area and a main thoroughfare for London buses and taxis, Oxford Street has suffered from traffic congestion, pedestrian congestion, a poor safety record, and pollution. Various traffic management schemes have been implemented by Transport for London (TFL) and others, including a ban on private vehicles during daytime hours on weekdays and Saturdays (in place since the 1970s), widened pavements, and improved pedestrian crossings.

==Location==
Oxford Street runs for approximately and is entirely within the City of Westminster. The road begins at St Giles Circus as a westward continuation of New Oxford Street, meeting Charing Cross Road, Tottenham Court Road (next to Tottenham Court Road station). It runs past Rathbone Place, Wardour Street, and Great Portland Street to Oxford Circus, where it meets Regent Street. From there it continues past New Bond Street, Bond Street station, and Vere Street, ending at Marble Arch. The route continues as Bayswater Road and Holland Park Avenue towards Shepherd&#x27;s Bush.

The road is within the London Congestion Charging Zone. It is part of the A40, most of which is a trunk road running from London to Fishguard (via Oxford, Cheltenham, Brecon, and Haverfordwest). Like many roads in Central London that are no longer through routes, it is not signposted with that number. Numerous bus routes run along Oxford Street, including the 55, 73, 94, 98, 159, 390, and Night Buses N8, N55, N73, N98 and N207.

==History==

===Early history===

Oxford Street follows the route of a Roman road, the Via Trinobantina, which linked Calleva Atrebatum (near Silchester, Hampshire) with Camulodunum (now Colchester) via London and became one of the major routes in and out of the city.

Between the 12th century and 1782, it was variously known as Tyburn Road (after the River Tyburn that crossed it north to south), Uxbridge Road (the name still used for the road between Shepherd&#x27;s Bush and Uxbridge), Worcester Road, and Oxford Road. On Ralph Aggas&#x27; &quot;Plan of London&quot;, published in the 16th century, the road is described partly as &quot;The Waye to Uxbridge&quot; followed by &quot;Oxford Road&quot;, showing rural farmland at the present junction of Oxford Street and Rathbone Place. By 1678 it was known as the &quot;King&#x27;s Highway&quot;, and the &quot;Road To Oxford&quot; by 1682.

Tyburn Parish Church stood on the north side of the road, at the point where it crossed the river (which ran alongside what is now Marylebone Lane). This church (the earliest documented building on Oxford Street) was demolished in 1400, a replacement church having been built further to the north. Later a court house was constructed on the site, which went on to serve as vestry hall for the parish; it continued to function as such until 1920, when it was superseded by Marylebone Town Hall. Tyburn gallows, near where Marble Arch now stands, was a place of public execution from 1388 to 1783. 

===The Georgian era===

Though a major coaching route, there were several obstacles along it, including the bridge over the Tyburn. A turnpike trust was established in 1721 to improve the upkeep of the road. It became notorious as the route taken by prisoners on their final journey from Newgate Prison to the gallows at Tyburn. Spectators jeered as the prisoners were carted along the road, and could buy rope used in the executions from the hangman in taverns. By about 1729, the road had become known as Oxford Street.

Development began in the 18th century after many surrounding fields were purchased by the Earl of Oxford. In 1739, a local gardener, Thomas Huddle, built property on the north side. After Lord Oxford&#x27;s death the estate was inherited by his daughter the Duchess of Portland; it then passed down to successive dukes as the Portland Estate, before becoming the Howard de Walden Estate in 1879 (by way of the 5th Duke&#x27;s sister). The Howard de Walden Estate progressively sold off its Oxford Street holdings (which lay on the north side between Marylebone Lane and Wells Street) in the first half of the twentieth century. Other landowning estates held sway over the western end of Oxford Street: most of the northern side west of Duke Street was and is owned by the Portman Estate, while facing it (on the southern side) most of the land west of Davies Street was and is part of the Grosvenor estate; east of both of these, the smaller but significant Conduit Mead Estate (which encompasses Stratford Place and New Bond Street) has been held by the City of London Corporation since the twelfth century. John Rocque&#x27;s Map of London, published in 1746, shows urban buildings extending as far west as North Audley Street (on the south side) and Marylebone Lane (on the north side), but only intermittent rural property beyond. Further development to the west occurred between 1763 and 1793 when building began on the Portman Estate. 

The Pantheon, a place for public entertainment, opened at No. 173 in 1772. The street became popular for entertainment including bear-baiters, theatres, and public houses. However, it was not attractive to the middle and upper classes due to the nearby Tyburn gallows and the notorious St Giles rookery, or slum. The gallows were removed in 1783, and by the end of the century, Oxford Street was built up from St Giles Circus to Park Lane, containing a mix of residential houses, shops and places of entertainment. 

Oxford Circus was designed as part of the development of Regent Street by the architect John Nash in 1810. It was later rebuilt (the four quadrants of the circus as seen today were designed by Sir Henry Tanner and constructed between 1913 and 1928).

The Pantheon closed as an entertainment venue in 1814 (twenty years later it was reopened as a covered bazaar); this prompted another bazaar (across the road at No. 150) to close, and in 1836 the Princess&#x27;s Theatre opened on the site.

===Retail and transport development===

Oxford Street changed in character from residential to retail towards the end of the 18th century. Recording an evening visit to the street in 1786, Sophie von La Roche described a multitude of shops lit by Argand lamps behind &#x27;handsome glass windows&#x27;: confectioners, fruiterers, watchmakers, silversmiths, &#x27;spirit booths&#x27; (selling strong drink), glass shops, china shops, silk shops, lamp shops and others. There were also clothing retailers of various sorts, and furniture-makers (such as Gillow &amp; Co., established in 1769). Street vendors sold tourist souvenirs during this time. 

A plan in Tallis&#x27;s &quot;London Street Views&quot;, published in the late 1830s, remarks that almost all the street, save for the far western end, was primarily retail. Peter Robinson opened his draper&#x27;s shop at 103 Oxford Street in the 1830s; by the 1890s the shop had expanded to fill the entire block between Great Portland Street and Regent Street. Likewise Marshall &amp; Snelgrove opened on Vere Street in 1837; within 40 years it had expanded to fill the entire block between that street and Marylebone Lane, and was housed (from 1870) in a new building designed by Horace Jones and Octavius Hansard. 
What would now be called department stores began to appear on Oxford Street in the 1870s (the rebuilt Marshall &amp; Snelgrove being one of the first). John Lewis started in 1864 in a small shop at No. 132; he took on an adjacent property in 1878, and over the next twenty years expanded further and began rebuilding. Dan Harries Evans opened a small draper&#x27;s shop at No. 147 in 1879; as D H Evans the business swiftly expanded, taking in more than a dozen properties either side of Old Cavendish Street and becoming one of London&#x27;s largest drapery establishments by the mid-1890s. At the same time, smaller independent retailers continued to thrive alongside their larger counterparts, specialising in all sorts of different goods, trades, and services.

Meanwhile, construction of the Central London Railway (now the Central line of the London Underground), which runs under Oxford Street for part of its course, began in 1896, which necessitated the development of four new station buildings on or near the street, at Marble Arch, Bond Street, Oxford Circus, and Tottenham Court Road. Of the three chief engineers of the project, only Benjamin Baker lived to see the railway completed. On 27 June 1900, the Prince of Wales (who became King Edward VII the following year) ceremonially opened the line and public services began on 30 July. The line&#x27;s route below Oxford Street made it the first railway to provide a direct service to the theatre and shopping areas of the West End and the City. The Bakerloo line came to Oxford Circus on 10 March 1906, and the Hampstead line to Tottenham Court Road on 22 June 1907 (it became the Northern line thirty years later).
Development continued through the first half of the 20th century, with Bourne &amp; Hollingsworth opening in 1902. When Waring &amp; Gillow opened their new store in 1906 it became the first West End store to occupy an entire city block. Selfridges opened on 15 March 1909 at No. 400; it promptly had a &#x27;transformative influence on Britain&#x27;s retail scene, elevating the concept of a department store as a social and cultural institution open to everyone, with innovative window dressing, exceptional customer service and masterly advertising&#x27;. Shoemakers Lilley &amp; Skinner acquired the lease of 358–360 Oxford Street in 1914; they later expanded into Nos. 356–366, reputedly becoming the world&#x27;s largest shoe store in 1921. In 1922 C&amp;A purchased Nos. 376–384 (before long C&amp;A had three stores on Oxford Street, which remained the case until their withdrawal from the UK market in 2001).

It is notable that all the aforementioned department stores were or are on the north side of the street. Whether this was down to a preference for south-facing shop fronts, or there being better access routes to the north for deliveries and services, or something akin to coincidence remains an open question. Some large stores were opened on the south side of the street in the 20th century: Woolworths opened its first West End store at No. 311 in 1925, followed by a handful of others in the 1930s (for example Littlewoods, which opened its first Central London store at Nos. 207–213 in 1937, later expanding into Nos. 197–205; it was rebuilt in the early 1960s but closed in the early 2000s). 
By the 1930s the street was almost entirely retail, a state that still exists today. However, unlike nearby streets such as Bond Street and Park Lane, there remained a seedy element including street traders and prostitutes. Gradually, as the century progressed, independent retailers began to be replaced by chain stores. 
During the Second World War, Oxford Street was bombed several times. Overnight and in the early hours of 17 to 18 September 1940, 268 Heinkel He 111 and Dornier Do 17 bombers targeted the West End, particularly Oxford Street. Many buildings were damaged, either from direct hits or subsequent fires, including four department stores: John Lewis, Selfridges, Bourne &amp; Hollingsworth, and Peter Robinson. George Orwell wrote in his diary on 24 September that Oxford Street was &quot;completely empty of traffic, and only a few pedestrians&quot;, and saw &quot;innumerable fragments of broken glass&quot;. John Lewis caught fire again on 25 September and was reduced to a shell. It remained a bomb site for the remainder of the war and beyond, finally being demolished and rebuilt between 1958 and 1960. Peter Robinson partially reopened on 22 September, though the main storefront remained boarded up. The basement was converted into studios for the BBC Eastern Service. Orwell made several broadcasts here from 1941 to 1943.

Selfridges was bombed again on 17 April 1941, suffering further damage, including the destruction of the Palm Court Restaurant. The basement was converted to a communications base, with a dedicated line running along Oxford Street to Whitehall. The line allowed British Prime Minister Winston Churchill to make secure and direct telephone calls to US President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The store was damaged again on 6 December 1944 after a V2 rocket exploded on nearby Duke Street, causing its Christmas tree displays to collapse into the street outside. Damage was repaired, and the shop reopened the following day.

===Postwar===

After its main store was destroyed, John Lewis operated from properties on the other side of Holles Street (i.e. to the east) until the completion of its new store to the west. Relinquishing these properties then enabled it to purchase the whole of the west side. 
Subsequently, the entire block between Holles Street and John Prince&#x27;s Street was sold by the Howard de Walden Estate to Land Securities for redevelopment: designed by T. P. Bennett &amp; Partners, it would provide small units of retail accommodation on either side of a central flagship department store (namely British Home Stores, until its closure in 2016). Atop the Oxford Street frontage a six-storey block was constructed to house the London College of Fashion, behind which a cluster of taller tower blocks provided office space. Begun in 1959 the work was largely completed within two years; it was one of the largest post-war redevelopment projects to be undertaken in the West End.

From August 1963 until April 1968 part of Oxford Street had to be closed to traffic so that Oxford Circus tube station could be rebuilt to incorporate the new Victoria line, which began serving the station on 7 March 1969, its official opening.

In September 1973 a shopping-bag bomb was detonated by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) at the offices of the Prudential Assurance Company, injuring six people. A second bomb was detonated by the IRA next to Selfridges in December 1974, injuring three people and causing £1.5 million worth of damage. Oxford Street was again targeted by the IRA in August 1975; an undiscovered bomb that had been booby trapped exploded without any injuries. 

On 26 October 1981 Kenneth Howorth, an explosives officer with the Metropolitan Police, was killed while defusing a bomb planted by the IRA in the basement toilet of a Wimpy Bar on Oxford Street. The IRA also detonated a bomb at the John Lewis department store in December 1992, along with another in nearby Cavendish Square, injuring four people.
The human billboard Stanley Green began selling on Oxford Street in 1968, advertising his belief in the link of proteins to sexual libido and the dangers therein. He regularly patrolled the street with a placard headlined &quot;less passion from less protein&quot;, and advertised his pamphlet &quot;Eight Passion Proteins with Care&quot; until his death in 1993. His placards are now housed in the British Museum.
The opening of Britain&#x27;s first out-of-town shopping centre at Brent Cross in 1976 prompted experiments with mall-style shopping precincts on Oxford Street. West One was developed by the Grosvenor Estate on the corner of Davies Street as part of the rebuilding of Bond Street tube station for the Jubilee line in 1979; it opened the following year. In 1986 The Plaza shopping centre was opened within the walls of the former Bourne &amp; Hollingsworth department store building (dating from 1925–1928), the latter having closed three years earlier. The Plaza itself closed in 2016 and a flagship Next store was opened on the site.

===COVID pandemic and subsequent changes===

The principal Topshop store by Oxford Circus shut in late 2020 after its parent company, Arcadia Group, went into administration, and Debenhams&#x27; flagship store closed (during the third COVID lockdown) in January 2021. A year later, following the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant, the Government introduced new lockdown restrictions, which caused problems with businesses along Oxford Street, which had been hampered by the pandemic since the previous year. The House of Fraser store closed in January 2022 as a result. An analyst at GlobalData said the street &quot;has been forever changed by the closure, or in some cases, downsizing of long-standing department stores&quot;.

By 2023 over 15% of retail premises on the street were vacant, and among those that remained open there had been a proliferation of &#x27;American candy stores&#x27; and vape shops. Subsequently the situation improved, in particular at the eastern end of the street (following completion of the new Tottenham Court Road Station), and in 2024 Westminster City Council announced a number of improvement measures. As of 2024, the former Debenhams and House of Fraser department stores were being converted into office buildings (with the ground floor retained for retail), and Marks &amp; Spencer received planning permission to demolish their flagship Marble Arch store and replace it with a ten-storey office scheme (again with some space retained for retail). John Lewis, however, reversed an earlier decision to turn half its building into office space, and instead reopened across all six floors.

==New Oxford Street==

New Oxford Street was built in 1847, in accordance with a plan of James Pennethorne, to link the eastern end of Oxford Street with High Holborn. It extends the axis of Oxford Street eastwards from St Giles Circus. Previously, the route into the City of London had deviated southwards at this point, to skirt around the ancient settlement of St Giles with its leper hospital. The building of the new street involved much slum clearance, but did not entirely eradicate the notorious old rookeries. Once a fashionable shopping street, a preponderance of office buildings has led to New Oxford Street no longer sharing the activity or ambience of its namesake; but in its central section a number of original 1840s stuccoed buildings have survived, providing a glimpse of its former character.

Centre Point, at the corner of New Oxford Street and Charing Cross Road, was one of London&#x27;s first skyscrapers (designed by R. Seifert &amp; Partners and completed in 1966). The tower was built by property developer Harry Hyams (with support from the London County Council planning department) as a speculative investment; left empty for over a decade, it was occupied for a time by protesters, demonstrating against a lack of suitable accommodation in central London. In 2015, building work began to convert it into residential flats; the restoration and conversion was completed in March 2018. Much as had been the case at its original opening, the refurbished tower remains largely empty, with few windows lit in the evenings, the rest in darkness, despite at least half its units being sold; this has led to its being called one of London&#x27;s &quot;ghost towers&quot;.

==Buildings==

Oxford Street is home to a number of major department stores and flagship retail outlets, containing over 300 shops as of 2012. It is the most frequently visited shopping street in Inner London, attracting over half a million daily visitors in 2014, and is one of the most popular destinations in London for tourists, with an annual estimated turnover of over £1 billion. It forms part of a shopping district in the West End of London, along with other streets including Covent Garden, Bond Street and Piccadilly.

The New West End Company, formerly the Oxford Street Association, oversees stores and trade along the street; its objective is to make the place safe and desirable for shoppers. The group has been critical of overcrowding and the quality of shops and has clamped down on abusive traders, who were then refused licences.

Several British retail chains regard their Oxford Street branch as the flagship store. In 1919 Marshall &amp; Snelgrove merged with Debenhams (which had opened in nearby Wigmore Street in 1778). The Oxford Street store continued to trade as Marshall &amp; Snelgrove until 1972, when the rebuilt premises were reopened as Debenhams. (Debenhams&#x27; flagship Oxford Street store closed in 2021.) 
The London flagship store of House of Fraser began as D. H. Evans in 1879; its current premises were designed by Louis Blanc and opened in 1937. It was the first department store in the UK with escalators serving every floor. It retained the D. H. Evans name until 2001, when it was rebranded as House of Fraser (the name of the parent company). House of Fraser closed in 2022.
Selfridges, Oxford Street, the second-largest department store in the UK and the flagship of the Selfridges chain, has been trading in Oxford Street since 1909. The building was erected in four stages over a twenty-two year period, having been designed by a combination of architects including D. H. Burnham &amp; Company, Frank Atkinson, Sir John Burnet and Thomas Tait. Its construction was influenced by American high rise technology: steel framing and reinforced concrete were employed to create a large and adaptable retail space, and their use was subsequently widely adopted across the UK&#x27;s high streets. The frontage to Oxford Street was, on completion, the largest shop façade in London.
Marks &amp; Spencer has two stores on Oxford Street. The first, Marks &amp; Spencer Marble Arch, is at the junction with Orchard Street; it was opened in 1930. The second branch, which opened eight years later, is between Regent Street and Tottenham Court Road, on the former site of the Pantheon. Both premises were significantly expanded in the second half of the 20th century.
Topshop was conceived in the 1960s as a youth brand for Peter Robinson, and a sizeable Topshop department was opened within the flagship store on Oxford Street (which had been rebuilt in the 1920s as part of the Oxford Circus improvements). Gradually Topshop took over more of the premises, operating alongside Peter Robinson for a time in the 1970s before the latter brand was withdrawn. It remained Topshop&#x27;s flagship store until 2021 when (the parent company Arcadia having gone into administration) it closed. From 1970 to 1991, the fourth floor of this building was occupied by AIR Studios recording production facilities. Ikea announced they would open a store on the former TopShop site in 2023. However, this was later pushed back to the following year.
The music retailer HMV was opened at No. 363 Oxford Street in 1921 by Sir Edward Elgar; the premises were twice rebuilt by Joseph Emberton in the moderne style, first in 1935 and then again in 1938–1939 (following a fire). The Beatles made their first recording in London in 1962, when they cut a 78 rpm demo disc in the store. A larger store at No. 150 (site of the old Princess&#x27;s Theatre) was opened in 1986 by Bob Geldof, and was the largest music shop in the world, at . As well as music and video retail, the premises supported live gigs in the store. Because of financial difficulties, the store closed in 2014, with all retail moving to No. 363 (which itself closed in 2020). In November 2023 the store at No. 363 was reopened, branded as &#x27;The HMV Shop&#x27;.
The 100 Club, in the basement of No. 100, has been run as a live music venue since 24 October 1942. It was thought to be safe from bombing threats because of its underground location, and played host to jazz musicians, including Glenn Miller. It was renamed the London Jazz Club in 1948, and subsequently the Humphrey Lyttelton Club after he took over the lease in the 1950s. Louis Armstrong played at the venue during this time. It became a key venue for the trad jazz revival, hosting gigs by Chris Barber and Acker Bilk. It was renamed the 100 Club in 1964 after Roger Horton bought a stake, adding an alcohol licence for the first time. The venue hosted gigs by several British rock bands, including the Who, the Kinks and the Animals. It was an important venue for punk rock in the UK and hosted the first British punk festival on 21 September 1976, featuring the Sex Pistols, the Damned and the Buzzcocks.

The Flying Horse (formerly The Tottenham) is a Grade II* listed pub at No. 6 Oxford Street, near Tottenham Court Road. It was built in the mid-19th century and is the last remaining pub in the street, which once had 20.

The London College of Fashion has an Oxford Street campus on John Prince&#x27;s Street near Oxford Circus. The college is part of the University of the Arts London, formerly the London Institute.

The Salvation Army opened Regent Hall, its first Central London venue, at Nos. 275–279 Oxford Street in 1882. It served as a base for poverty relief, street missions and a Salvation Army band. Rebuilt in 1959–1960, the hall remains in Salvation Army use.

The cosmetics retailer Lush opened a store in 2015. Measuring and containing three floors, it is the company&#x27;s largest retail premises.
Two large hotels dominate the western (Marble Arch) end of the street: the red brick Mount Royal Hotel (now the Amba) was built in 1933–1934 to a design by Francis Lorne; while the Portland stone-fronted Cumberland Hotel, by F. J.Wills, opened in 1933 (it was renamed the Hard Rock Hotel in 2018).

===Listed buildings===
Oxford Street has several Grade II listed buildings. In addition, the façades to Oxford Circus tube station are also listed.


==Transport links==

Oxford Street is served by major bus routes and by four tube stations of the London Underground (all on the Central line). From Marble Arch eastwards, the stations are:
*Marble Arch, on the Central line.
*Bond Street, on the Central line, Jubilee line, and the Elizabeth line.
*Oxford Circus, on the Bakerloo line, Central line and Victoria line.
*Tottenham Court Road, on the Central line, Northern line and the Elizabeth line.

The four stations serve an average of 100 million passengers every year, with Oxford Circus being the busiest.

The Elizabeth line has two stations serving Oxford Street: at Bond Street and Tottenham Court Road. Each station is &quot;double-ended&quot;, with exits through the existing tube station and also some distance away: to the east of Bond Street, in Hanover Square near Oxford Circus; to the west of Tottenham Court Road, in Dean Street.

==Traffic==

Oxford Street has been ranked as the most important retail location in Britain and the busiest shopping street in Europe. The pavements are congested because of shoppers and tourists, many of whom arrive at a tube station, and the roadway is regularly blocked by buses.

There is heavy competition between foot and bus traffic on Oxford Street, which is the main east–west bus corridor through Central London. Around 175,000 people get on or off a bus on Oxford Street every day, along with 43,000 further through passengers. Taxis are popular, particularly along the stretch between Oxford Circus and Selfridges. Between 2009 and 2012, there were 71 accidents involving traffic and pedestrians. In 2016, a report suggested buses generally did not travel faster than , compared to a typical pedestrian speed of .

There have been several proposals to reduce congestion on Oxford Street. Horse-drawn vehicles were banned in 1931, and traffic signals were installed the same year. To prevent congestion of buses, most of Oxford Street is designated a bus lane during peak hours and private vehicles are banned. This is only open to buses, taxis and two-wheeled vehicles between 7:00am and 7:00pm on all days except Sundays. 

The ban was introduced experimentally in June 1972 and was considered a success, with an estimated increase of £250,000 in retail sales. However, the area is popular with unregulated rickshaws, which are a major cause of congestion in the area. Their slow speed, coupled with the narrowness of the street (buses are unable to pass them, causing long traffic queues), only adds to the traffic woes. In 2009, a new diagonal crossing opened at Oxford Circus, allowing pedestrians to cross from one corner of Oxford Street to the opposite without needing to cross twice or use an underpass. This doubles the pedestrian capacity at the junction.

===Pedestrianisation===
From 2005 to 2012, Oxford Street was closed to motor traffic on VIP Day, (Very Important Pedestrians), a Saturday before Christmas. The scheme was popular and boosted sales by over £17m in 2012 but in 2013, the New West End Company announced that the scheme would not go ahead as it wanted to do &quot;something new&quot;. In 2014, Liberal Democrat members of the London Assembly proposed the street be pedestrianised by 2020.

In 2006, the New West End Company and the mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, proposed to pedestrianize the street with a tram service running end to end. The next mayor, Boris Johnson, elected in 2008, announced that the scheme was not cost-effective, was too disruptive and would not go ahead. In response to a request from Johnson, Transport for London (TfL) reduced bus flow by 10% in both 2009 and 2010. The New West End Company called for a 33% reduction in bus movements.

In 2014, TfL suggested that pedestrianisation may not be a suitable long-term measure due to Crossrail reducing the demand for bus services on the street and proposed banning all traffic except buses and cycles during peak shopping times. Optimisation of traffic signals, including pedestrian countdown signals, was also proposed. TfL is concerned that long-term traffic problems may affect trade in the area, which competes with shopping centres such as Westfield London, Westfield Stratford City and the Brent Cross Shopping Centre. In 2015, while campaigning for election as London Mayor, Labour&#x27;s Sadiq Khan favoured pedestrianisation, which was supported by other parties. After winning the election, he pledged the street would be completely pedestrianised by 2020. In 2017, the project was brought forward to be completed by the end of the following year. The plan was disapproved by local residents and the Fitzrovia Business Association, and in 2018 Westminster City Council blocked it; but in 2024 Khan, following his re-election as Mayor, announced a new scheme for pedestrianisation of the street between Oxford Circus and Marble Arch.

==Pollution==
In 2014, a report by a scientist at King&#x27;s College London showed that Oxford Street had the world&#x27;s highest concentration of nitrogen dioxide pollution, at 135 micrograms per cubic metre of air (μg/m3). The figure was an average that included night-time, when traffic was much lower. At peak times during the day, levels up to 463 μg/m3 were recorded – over 11 times the permitted EU maximum of 40 μg/m3. Because of diesel-powered traffic (buses and taxis), annual average nitrogen dioxide concentrations are around 180 μg/m3. This is 4.5 times the EU target of 40 μg/m3 (Council Directive 1999/30/EC).

==Crime==
Oxford Street has suffered from high crime rates. In 2005, an internal Metropolitan Police report named it as the most dangerous street in Central London. In 2012, an analysis of crime statistics revealed that Oxford Street was the shopping destination most surrounded by crime in the UK. During 2011, there were 656 vehicle crimes, 915 robberies, 2,597 violent crimes and 5,039 reported instances of anti-social behaviour.

In 2014, the United Arab Emirates issued a travel advisory, warning Emirati citizens to avoid Oxford Street and other areas of Central London such as Bond Street and Piccadilly due to &quot;pickpocketing, fraud and theft&quot;. The advent of closed-circuit television has reduced the area&#x27;s attraction to scam artists and illegal street traders.

In 2021, police seized 17,500 items including fake designer goods, unsafe toys and incorrectly-labelled nicotine products as part of Operation Jade. 4,000 items were removed from an unregistered food trader, including two bags with a quantity of Tetrahydrocannabinol over the legal limit. Trading Standards also took 11,000 goods and 2,500 souvenirs from unlicensed businesses and street traders.

In 2023, Oxford Street received much attention in the media over a number of import candy shops which had moved in, with it being alleged that the businesses were front companies for organised crime, particularly money laundering. Efforts by Westminster City Council in curtailing the shops&#x27; operations were also highlighted, as it was found that many of the businesses implicated had been engaging in tax evasion by refusing to pay the local business rate. Westminster City Council conducted raids on several businesses, with at least 24 under active investigation for fraud and money laundering.

==Christmas lights==
Every Christmas, Oxford Street is decorated with festive lights. The tradition of Christmas lights began in 1959, five years after neighbouring Regent Street. There were no light displays in 1976 or 1977 because of economic recession, but the lights returned in 1978 when Oxford Street organised a laser display, and have continued every year since.

Current practice involves a celebrity turning the lights on in mid- to late-November, and the lights remain until 6 January (Twelfth Night). The festivities were postponed in 1963 because of the assassination of John F. Kennedy and in 1989 to fit with Kylie Minogue&#x27;s touring commitments. In 2015, the lights were switched on earlier, on Sunday 1 November, resulting in an unusual closure of the street to all traffic. In 2020, the lights honoured volunteers who had helped London residents through the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

==Cultural references==

De Quincey refers to &quot;Oxford-street&quot; as a &quot;stony hearted step-mother&quot; in Confessions of an English Opium-Eater (1821), the first part of which is set there.

Oxford Street is mentioned in several Charles Dickens novels. In &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;, as Oxford Road, it is described as having &quot;very few buildings&quot;, though it was heavily built up by the late 18th century. It is also mentioned in &quot;Sketches by Boz&quot; and &quot;Bleak House&quot;.

&quot;Oxford Street&quot; is one of the London poet Letitia Elizabeth Landon&#x27;s &quot;Scenes in London&quot;. In this poem the busy bustle of commercial life is interrupted by and contrasted with the procession of a military funeral.
The street is a square on the British &quot;Monopoly&quot; game board, part of the green set (together with Regent Street and Bond Street). The streets were grouped together as they are all primarily retail areas.

&quot;Oxford St, W1&quot;, the B-side to the Television Personalities&#x27; 1978 debut single &quot;14th Floor&quot;, refers to the street. In 1991, music manager and entrepreneur Malcolm McLaren produced &quot;The Ghosts of Oxford Street&quot;, a musical documentary about life and history in the local area.

<text>The gigue ( , ) or giga () is a lively baroque dance originating from the English jig. It was imported into France in the mid-17th century and usually appears at the end of a suite. The gigue was probably never a court dance, but it was danced by nobility on social occasions and several court composers wrote gigues.

A gigue is usually in or in one of its compound metre derivatives, such as , , or , although there are some gigues written in other metres, as for example the gigue from Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s first &quot;French Suite&quot; (BWV 812), which is written in and has a distinctive strutting &quot;dotted&quot; rhythm. 

Gigues often have a contrapuntal texture as well as often having accents on the third beats in the bar, making the gigue a lively folk dance.

In early French theatre, it was customary to end a play&#x27;s performance with a gigue, complete with music and dancing.

A gigue, like other Baroque dances, consists of two sections.

==Etymology==
An early Italian dance called the &quot;giga&quot; probably derives its name from a small accompanying stringed instrument called the giga. Historians, such as Charles Read Baskerville, claim that use of the word in relation to dancing took place in England prior to such usage on the Continent. &quot;Giga&quot; probably has a separate etymology.

==Cultural references==
Jonathan Littell&#x27;s novel &quot;The Kindly Ones&quot; is structured in different parts, each one of these named after a Baroque dance, the last part being called &quot;Gigue&quot;.

<doc id="229198" wikidata="Q134798" url="?curid=229198" title="Haruki Murakami">
<text>is a Japanese writer. His novels, essays, and short stories have been best-sellers in Japan and internationally, with his work translated into 50 languages and having sold millions of copies outside Japan. He has received numerous awards for his work, including the Gunzo Prize for New Writers, the World Fantasy Award, the Tanizaki Prize, Yomiuri Prize for Literature, the Frank O&#x27;Connor International Short Story Award, the Noma Literary Prize, the Franz Kafka Prize, the Kiriyama Prize for Fiction, the Goodreads Choice Awards for Best Fiction, the Jerusalem Prize, and the Princess of Asturias Awards.

Growing up in Ashiya, near Kobe before moving to Tokyo to attend Waseda University, he published his first novel &quot;Hear the Wind Sing&quot; (1979) after working as the owner of a small jazz bar for seven years. His notable works include the novels &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; (1987), &quot;The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle&quot; (1994–95), &quot;Kafka on the Shore&quot; (2002) and &quot;1Q84&quot; (2009–10); the last was ranked as the best work of Japan&#x27;s Heisei era (1989–2019) by the national newspaper &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; survey of literary experts. His work spans genres including science fiction, fantasy, and crime fiction, and has become known for his use of magical realist elements. His official website cites Raymond Chandler, Kurt Vonnegut and Richard Brautigan as key inspirations to his work, while Murakami himself has named Kazuo Ishiguro, Cormac McCarthy, and Dag Solstad as his favorite contemporary writers. Murakami has also published five short story collections, including &quot;First Person Singular&quot; (2020), and non-fiction works including &quot;Underground&quot; (1997), an oral history of the Tokyo subway sarin attack, and &quot;What I Talk About When I Talk About Running&quot; (2007), a memoir about his experience as a long distance runner.

His fiction has polarized literary critics and the reading public. He has sometimes been criticised by Japan&#x27;s literary establishment as un-Japanese, leading to Murakami&#x27;s recalling that he was a &quot;black sheep in the Japanese literary world&quot;. Meanwhile, Murakami has been described by Gary Fisketjon, the editor of Murakami&#x27;s collection &quot;The Elephant Vanishes&quot; (1993), as a &quot;truly extraordinary writer&quot;, while Steven Poole of &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised Murakami as &quot;among the world&#x27;s greatest living novelists&quot; for his oeuvre.

==Biography==
Murakami was born in Kyoto, Japan, during the post-World War II baby boom and was raised in Nishinomiya, Ashiya and Kobe. He is an only child. His father was the son of a Buddhist priest, and his mother is the daughter of an Osaka merchant. Both taught Japanese literature. His father was involved in the Second Sino-Japanese War, and was deeply traumatized by it, which would, in turn, affect Murakami.

Since childhood, Murakami, like Kōbō Abe, has been heavily influenced by Western culture, particularly Western as well as Russian music and literature. He grew up reading a wide range of works by European and American writers, such as Franz Kafka, Gustave Flaubert, Charles Dickens, Kurt Vonnegut, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Richard Brautigan and Jack Kerouac. These Western influences distinguish Murakami from the majority of other Japanese writers.

Murakami studied drama at Waseda University in Tokyo, where he met Yoko, now his wife. His first job was at a record store. Shortly before finishing his studies, Murakami opened a coffee house and jazz bar, Peter Cat, in Kokubunji, Tokyo, which he ran with his wife, from 1974 to 1981. The couple decided not to have children.

Murakami is an experienced marathon runner and triathlon enthusiast, though he did not start running until he was 33 years old, after he began as a way to stay healthy. On June 23, 1996, he completed his first ultramarathon, a 100 km race around Lake Saroma in Hokkaido, Japan. He discussed running and its effect on his creative life in a 2007 memoir, &quot;What I Talk About When I Talk About Running&quot;.

==Writing career==
===&quot;Trilogy of the Rat&quot;===
Murakami began to write fiction when he was 29. &quot;Before that,&quot; he said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t write anything. I was just one of those ordinary people. I was running a jazz club, and I didn&#x27;t create anything at all.&quot; He was inspired to write his first novel, &quot;Hear the Wind Sing&quot; (1979), while watching a baseball game. He described the moment he realized he could write as a &quot;warm sensation&quot; he could still feel in his heart. He went home and began writing that night. Murakami worked on &quot;Hear the Wind Sing&quot; for ten months in very brief stretches, during nights, after working days at the bar. He completed the novel and sent it to the only literary contest that would accept a work of that length, winning first prize.

Murakami&#x27;s initial success with &quot;Hear the Wind Sing&quot; encouraged him to continue writing. A year later, he published a sequel, &quot;Pinball, 1973&quot;. In 1981, he co-wrote a short story collection, &quot;Yume de Aimashou&quot; with author and future &quot;Earthbound/Mother&quot; creator Shigesato Itoi. In 1982, he published &quot;A Wild Sheep Chase&quot;, a critical success. Hear the Wind Sing, &quot;Pinball, 1973&quot;, and &quot;A Wild Sheep Chase&quot; form the &quot;Trilogy of the Rat&quot; (a sequel, &quot;Dance, Dance, Dance&quot;, was written later but is not considered part of the series), centered on the same unnamed narrator and his friend, &quot;the Rat&quot;. The first two novels were not widely available in English translation outside Japan until 2015, although an English edition, translated by Alfred Birnbaum with extensive notes, had been published by Kodansha as part of a series intended for Japanese students of English. Murakami considers his first two novels to be &quot;immature&quot; and &quot;flimsy&quot;, and has not been eager to have them translated into English. &quot;A Wild Sheep Chase&quot;, he says, was &quot;the first book where I could feel a kind of sensation, the joy of telling a story. When you read a good story, you just keep reading. When I write a good story, I just keep writing.&quot;

===Wider recognition===
In 1985, Murakami wrote &quot;Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World&quot;, a dream-like fantasy that took the magical elements of his work to a new extreme. Murakami achieved a major breakthrough and national recognition in 1987 with the publication of &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot;, a nostalgic story of loss and sexuality. It sold millions of copies among young Japanese.

&quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; propelled the barely known Murakami into the spotlight. He was mobbed at airports and other public places, leading to his departure from Japan in 1986. Murakami traveled through Europe, lived in the United States and currently resides in Oiso, Kanagawa, with an office in Tokyo.

Murakami was a writing fellow at Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey, Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts, and Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. During this time he wrote &quot;South of the Border, West of the Sun&quot; and &quot;The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle&quot;.

===From &quot;detachment&quot; to &quot;commitment&quot;===
&quot;The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle&quot; (1995) fuses the realistic and fantastic and contains elements of physical violence. It is also more socially conscious than his previous work, dealing in part with the difficult topic of war crimes in Manchukuo (Northeast China). The novel won the Yomiuri Prize, awarded by one of Murakami&#x27;s harshest former critics, Kenzaburō Ōe, who himself won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1994.

The processing of collective trauma soon became an important theme in Murakami&#x27;s writing, which had previously been more personal in nature. Murakami returned to Japan in the aftermath of the Kobe earthquake and the Aum Shinrikyo gas attack. He came to terms with these events with his first work of non-fiction, &quot;Underground&quot;, and the short story collection &quot;after the quake&quot;. &quot;Underground&quot; consists largely of interviews of victims of the gas attacks in the Tokyo subway system.

In 1996, in a conversation with the psychologist Hayao Kawai, Murakami explained that he changed his position from one of &quot;detachment&quot; to one of &quot;commitment&quot; after staying in the United States in the 1990s. He called &quot;The Wind-up Bird Chronicle&quot; a turning point in his career, marking this change in focus.

English translations of many of his short stories written between 1983 and 1990 have been collected in &quot;The Elephant Vanishes&quot;. Murakami has also translated many works of F. Scott Fitzgerald, Raymond Carver, Truman Capote, John Irving, and Paul Theroux, among others, into Japanese.

Murakami took an active role in translation of his work into English, encouraging &quot;adaptations&quot; of his texts to American reality rather than direct translation. Some of his works that appeared in German turned out to be translations from English rather than Japanese (&quot;South of the Border, West of the Sun&quot;, 2000; &quot;The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle&quot;, 2000s), encouraged by Murakami himself. Both were later re-translated from Japanese.

===Since 1999===
&quot;Sputnik Sweetheart&quot; was first published in 1999, followed by &quot;Kafka on the Shore&quot; in 2002, with the English translation following in 2005. &quot;Kafka on the Shore&quot; won the World Fantasy Award in 2006. The English version of his novel &quot;After Dark&quot; was released in May 2007. It was chosen by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as a &quot;notable book of the year&quot;. In late 2005, Murakami published a collection of short stories titled &quot;Tōkyō Kitanshū&quot;, or 東京奇譚集, which translates loosely as &quot;Mysteries of Tokyo&quot;. A collection of the English versions of twenty-four short stories, titled &quot;Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman&quot;, was published in August 2006. This collection includes both older works from the 1980s as well as some of Murakami&#x27;s more recent short stories, including all five that appear in &quot;Tōkyō Kitanshū&quot;.

In 2002, Murakami published the anthology &quot;Birthday Stories&quot;, which collects short stories on the theme of birthdays. It includes work by Russell Banks, Ethan Canin, Raymond Carver, David Foster Wallace, Denis Johnson, Claire Keegan, Andrea Lee, Daniel Lyons, Lynda Sexson, Paul Theroux, and William Trevor, as well as a story by Murakami himself. &quot;What I Talk About When I Talk About Running&quot;, a memoir about his experience as a marathon runner and a triathlete, was published in Japan in 2007, with English translations released in the UK and the US in 2008. The title is a play on that of Raymond Carver&#x27;s short story collection &quot;What We Talk About When We Talk About Love&quot;.

In 2004, Murakami was interviewed by John Wray for the 182nd installment of &quot;The Paris Review&quot; &quot;The Art of Fiction&quot; interview series. Recorded over the course of two afternoons, the interview addressed the change in tone and style of his more recent works at the time—such as after the quake—his myriad of Western influences ranging from Fyodor Dostoevsky to John Irving, and his collaborative process with the many translators he has worked with over the course of his career.

Shinchosha Publishing published Murakami&#x27;s novel &quot;1Q84&quot; in Japan on May 29, 2009. &quot;1Q84&quot; is pronounced &quot;ichi kyū hachi yon&quot;, the same as &quot;1984&quot;, as &quot;9&quot; is also pronounced &quot;kyū&quot; in Japanese. The book was longlisted for the Man Asian Literary Prize in 2011. However, after the 2012 anti-Japanese demonstrations in China, Murakami&#x27;s books were removed from sale there, along with those of other Japanese authors. Murakami criticized the China–Japan political territorial dispute, characterizing the overwrought nationalistic response as &quot;cheap liquor&quot; which politicians were giving to the public. In April 2013, he published his novel &quot;Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage&quot;. It became an international bestseller but received mixed reviews.

In 2015, Switch Publishing published Murakami&#x27;s essay collection &quot;Novelist as a Vocation&quot; in Japan, featuring insights and commentaries on Murakami&#x27;s life and career. The essay collection was later translated into English by Philip Gabriel and Ted Goossen and released by Alfred A. Knopf on November 8, 2022.

&quot;Killing Commendatore&quot; (Kishidanchō-goroshi) was published in Japan on February 24, 2017, and in the US in October 2018. The novel is about an unnamed portrait painter who stumbles upon an unknown painting, titled &quot;Killing Commendatore&quot;, after assuming residence in its creator&#x27;s former abode. Since its publication, the novel has caused controversy in Hong Kong and was labeled under &quot;Class II – indecent&quot; in Hong Kong. This classification led to mass amounts of censorship. The publisher must not distribute the book to people under the age of 18, and must have a warning label printed on the cover.

Murakami&#x27;s most recent novel &quot;The City and Its Uncertain Walls&quot; was published by Shinchosha in Japan on April 13, 2023. His first novel in six years, it is 1,200-pages long and is set in a &quot;soul-stirring, 100% pure Murakami world&quot; that involves &quot;a story that had long been sealed&quot;. In promoting his latest book, Murakami stated that he believed that the pandemic and the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine have created walls that divide people, fueling fear and skepticism instead of mutual trust. The novel is based on a 1980 novella written by Murakami, which he says he was never satisfied with. In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Marakami states, &quot;The situation of the town surrounded by walls was also a metaphor of the worldwide lockdown. How is it possible for both extreme isolation and warm feelings of empathy to coexist?&quot;

In July 2024, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; published Murakami&#x27;s short story &quot;Kaho&quot;, in which a man goes on a blind date with a woman named Kaho and ends it with an insult, which is also the first line of the story.

==Writing style==
Most of Haruki Murakami&#x27;s works use first-person narrative in the tradition of the Japanese I-novel. He states that because family plays a significant role in traditional Japanese literature, any main character who is independent becomes a man who values freedom and solitude over intimacy. Also notable is Murakami&#x27;s unique humor, as seen in his 2000 short story collection &quot;After the Quake&quot;. In the story &quot;Superfrog Saves Tokyo&quot;, the protagonist is confronted with a six-foot-tall frog that talks about the destruction of Tokyo over a cup of tea. In spite of the story&#x27;s sober tone, Murakami feels the reader should be entertained once the seriousness of a subject has been broached. Another notable feature of Murakami&#x27;s stories are the comments that come from the main characters as to how strange the story presents itself. Murakami explains that his characters experience what he experiences as he writes, which could be compared to a movie set where the walls and props are all fake. He has further compared the process of writing to movies: &quot;That is one of the joys of writing fiction—I&#x27;m making my own film made just for myself.&quot;

Murakami&#x27;s writing is often described as magical realism with surreal elements. His novels are described as being acted experiences rather than linear stories, with characters doing things without reasoning or explanation. Murakami himself however does not consider his writing to be surrealistic or magical realism: &quot;I simply write the stories that I want to write, and in a style that suits me. When I write fiction, the story sort of moves on ahead naturally, like flowing water following the lay of the land. All I&#x27;m doing is putting this flow into words, as faithfully as I can.&quot;

Many of his novels have themes and titles that evoke classical music, such as the three books making up &quot;The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle&quot;: &quot;The Thieving Magpie&quot; (after Rossini&#x27;s opera), &quot;Bird as Prophet&quot; (after a piano piece by Robert Schumann usually known in English as &quot;The Prophet Bird&quot;), and &quot;The Bird-Catcher&quot; (a character in Mozart&#x27;s opera &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;). Some of his novels take their titles from songs: &quot;Dance, Dance, Dance&quot; (after The Dells&#x27; 1957 B-side song, although it is often thought it was titled after the Beach Boys&#x27; 1964 tune), &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; (after The Beatles&#x27; song) and &quot;South of the Border, West of the Sun&quot; (after the song &quot;South of the Border&quot;).

Some analyses see aspects of shamanism in his writing. In a 2000 article, Susan Fisher connected Shinto or Japanese shamanism with some elements of &quot;The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle&quot;, such as a descent into a dry well. At an October 2013 symposium held at the University of Hawaii, associate professor of Japanese Nobuko Ochner opined &quot;there were many descriptions of traveling in a parallel world as well as characters who have some connection to shamanism&quot; in Murakami&#x27;s works.

In an October 2022 article for &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, Murakami clarified that nearly none of the characters in his work has been created based on individuals in real life, as many people alleged. He wrote: &quot;I almost never decide in advance that I&#x27;ll present a particular type of character. As I write, a kind of axis forms that makes possible the appearance of certain characters, and I go ahead and fit one detail after another into place, like iron scraps attaching to a magnet. And in this way an overall picture of a person materializes. Afterward I often think that certain details resemble those of a real person, but most of the process happens automatically. I think I almost unconsciously pull information and various fragments from the cabinets in my brain and then weave them together.&quot; Murakami named this process &quot;the Automatic Dwarfs.&quot; He continued: &quot;One of the things I most enjoy about writing novels is the sense that I can become anybody I want to be,&quot; noting that &quot;Characters who are—in a literary sense—alive will eventually break free of the writer&#x27;s control and begin to act independently.&quot;

Murakami was also awarded the 2007 Kiriyama Prize for Fiction for his collection of short stories &quot;Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman&quot;, but according to the prize&#x27;s official website, Murakami &quot;declined to accept the award for reasons of personal principle&quot;.

===Personal prizes===

In 2006, Murakami became the sixth recipient of the Franz Kafka Prize.

In January 2009, Murakami received the Jerusalem Prize, a biennial literary award given to writers whose work deals with themes of human freedom, society, politics, and government. There were protests in Japan and elsewhere against his attending the February award ceremony in Israel, including threats to boycott his work as a response against Israel&#x27;s recent bombing of Gaza. Murakami chose to attend the ceremony, but gave a speech to the gathered Israeli dignitaries harshly criticizing Israeli policies. Murakami said, &quot;Each of us possesses a tangible living soul. The system has no such thing. We must not allow the system to exploit us.&quot; The same year he was named Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters of Spain.

In 2011, Murakami donated his €80,000 winnings from the International Catalunya Prize (from the Generalitat de Catalunya) to the victims of the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, and to those affected by the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Accepting the award, he said in his speech that the situation at the Fukushima plant was &quot;the second major nuclear disaster that the Japanese people have experienced ... however, this time it was not a bomb being dropped upon us, but a mistake committed by our very own hands&quot;. According to Murakami, the Japanese people should have rejected nuclear power after having &quot;learned through the sacrifice of the hibakusha just how badly radiation leaves scars on the world and human wellbeing&quot;.

In recent years, Haruki Murakami has often been mentioned as a possible recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature. Nonetheless, since all nomination records are sealed for 50 years from the awarding of the prize, it is pure speculation. When asked about the possibility of being awarded the Nobel Prize, Murakami responded with a laugh saying &quot;No, I don&#x27;t want prizes. That means you&#x27;re finished.&quot;

In October 2014, he was awarded the &quot;Welt&quot;-Literaturpreis.

In April 2015, Murakami was named one of the &quot;Time&quot; 100 most influential people. In November 2016, he was awarded the Danish Hans Christian Andersen Literature Award, an award previously won by British author J. K. Rowling.

In 2018, he was nominated for the New Academy Prize in Literature. He requested that his nomination be withdrawn, saying he wanted to &quot;concentrate on writing, away from media attention.&quot;

In 2023, he was awarded the Princess of Asturias Award for Literature.

In 2024, Murakami received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement and was elected as a Royal Society of Literature International Writer.

===Honorary degrees===
Murakami has received honorary degrees (Doctor of Letters) from the University of Liège (September 2007), Princeton University (June 2008), Tufts University (May 2014), Yale University (May 2016), and University of Nova Gorica (2021).

==Archives==

In 2018, Waseda University in Tokyo agreed to house the archives of Haruki Murakami, including his manuscripts, source documents, and music collection. Later in September 2021, architect Kengo Kuma announced the opening of the Waseda International House of Literature, a library dedicated entirely to Murakami&#x27;s works at Waseda University, which would include more than 3,000 works by Murakami, including translations into more than 50 other languages.

The library, officially known as the Waseda International House of Literature or the Haruki Murakami Library, opened on October 1, 2021. In addition to its vast collection of written material, the library also hosts a coffee shop run by Waseda University students—called Orange Cat, after Murakami&#x27;s Peter Cat jazz bar from his twenties—in addition to a listening lounge where visitors can listen to records collected by Murakami himself.

==Films and other adaptations==

Murakami&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Hear the Wind Sing&quot; (&quot;Kaze no uta o kike&quot;), was adapted by Japanese director Kazuki Ōmori. The film was released in 1981 and distributed by Art Theatre Guild. Naoto Yamakawa directed two short films, &quot;Attack on the Bakery&quot; (released in 1982) and &quot;A Girl, She is 100 Percent&quot; (released in 1983), based on Murakami&#x27;s short stories &quot;Bakery Attack&quot; and &quot;On Seeing the 100% Perfect Girl One Beautiful April Morning&quot;, respectively. Japanese director Jun Ichikawa adapted Murakami&#x27;s short story &quot;Tony Takitani&quot; into a 75-minute feature. The film played at various film festivals and was released in New York and Los Angeles on July 29, 2005. The original short story, translated into English by Jay Rubin, is available in the April 15, 2002, issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, as a stand-alone book published by Cloverfield Press, and part of &quot;Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman&quot; by Knopf. In 1998, the German film &quot;The Polar Bear&quot; (), written and directed by Granz Henman, used elements of Murakami&#x27;s short story &quot;The Second Bakery Attack&quot; in three intersecting story lines. &quot;The Second Bakery Attack&quot; was also adapted as a short film in 2010, directed by Carlos Cuarón, starring Kirsten Dunst and as part of a segment in the South Korean omnibus film Acoustic.

Murakami&#x27;s work was also adapted for the stage in a 2003 play entitled &quot;The Elephant Vanishes&quot;, co-produced by Britain&#x27;s Complicite company and Japan&#x27;s Setagaya Public Theatre. The production, directed by Simon McBurney, adapted three of Murakami&#x27;s short stories and received acclaim for its unique blending of multimedia (video, music, and innovative sound design) with actor-driven physical theater (mime, dance, and even acrobatic wire work). On tour, the play was performed in Japanese, with supertitle translations for European and American audiences.

Two stories from Murakami&#x27;s book &quot;after the quake&quot;&quot;Honey Pie&quot; and &quot;Superfrog Saves Tokyo&quot;have been adapted for the stage and directed by Frank Galati. Entitled &quot;after the quake&quot;, the play was first performed at the Steppenwolf Theatre Company in association with La Jolla Playhouse, and opened on October 12, 2007, at Berkeley Repertory Theatre. In 2008, Galati also adapted and directed a theatrical version of &quot;Kafka on the Shore&quot;, which first ran at Chicago&#x27;s Steppenwolf Theatre Company from September to November.

On Max Richter&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;Songs from Before&quot;, Robert Wyatt reads passages from Murakami&#x27;s novels. In 2007, Robert Logevall adapted &quot;All God&#x27;s Children Can Dance&quot; into a film, with a soundtrack composed by American jam band Sound Tribe Sector 9. In 2008, Tom Flint adapted &quot;On Seeing the 100% Perfect Girl One Beautiful April Morning&quot; into a short film. The film was screened at the 2008 CON-CAN Movie Festival. The film was viewed, voted, and commented upon as part of the audience award for the movie festival.

It was announced in July 2008 that French-Vietnamese director Tran Anh Hung would direct an adaptation of Murakami&#x27;s novel &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot;. The film was released in Japan on December 11, 2010.

In 2010, Stephen Earnhart adapted &quot;The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle&quot; into a two-hour multimedia stage presentation. The show opened January 12, 2010, as part of the Public Theater&#x27;s &quot;Under the Radar&quot; festival at the Ohio Theater in New York City, presented in association with The Asia Society and the Baryshnikov Arts Center. The show had its world premiere at the Edinburgh International Festival on August 21, 2011. The presentation incorporates live actors, video projection, traditional Japanese puppetry, and immersive soundscapes to render the surreal landscape of the original work.

In 2013, pianist Eunbi Kim debuted a performance piece, titled &quot;Murakami Music: Stories of Loss and Nostalgia&quot;, drawn from excerpts of Murakami&#x27;s work as part of her artist residency at the Cell Theatre in New York City. Excerpts included Reiko&#x27;s monologue from Norwegian Wood (novel), as well as the self-titled song of Kafka on the Shore. The performance piece was acted by Laura Yumi Snell and directed by Kira Simring. From 2013 to 2014, Kim and Snell performed across the United States, notably with a premiere at Symphony Space and a showing at Georgetown University.

&quot;Memoranda&quot;, a 2017 adventure video game, is based on various short stories from &quot;After the Quake&quot;, &quot;Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman&quot;, and &quot;The Elephant Vanishes&quot;, and features several Murakami characters, with Mizuki Ando as the protagonist.

In 2018, &quot;Barn Burning&quot;&quot;&quot; from Murakami&#x27;s short story collection &quot;The Elephant Vanishes&quot; was adapted into a film titled &quot;Burning&quot; by director Lee Chang-dong. The film was awarded the FIPRESCI International Critics’ Prize for best film, receiving the highest score to date. It was also South Korea&#x27;s submission for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film in 2019.

A film based on the short story &quot;Drive My Car&quot; premiered at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival, where it won Best Screenplay, the FIPRESCI Prize, and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury. The film went on to win the Academy Award for Best International Feature and received three other nominations: Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay. Directed by Ryusuke Hamaguchi, it also takes inspiration from Chekhov&#x27;s play &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; as well as &quot;Scheherazade&quot; and &quot;Kino,&quot; two other stories in the collection &quot;Men Without Women&quot;.

In 2022, director Pierre Földes adapted six short stories from Murakami&#x27;s books &quot;After the Quake&quot;, &quot;Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman&quot; and &quot;The&quot; &quot;Elephant&quot; &quot;Vanishes&quot; into an animated feature film. The film, titled &quot;Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman&quot;, is an international co-production of Canada, France, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. The film premiered in the feature film competition at the 2022 Annecy International Animation Film Festival, where it was awarded a Jury Distinction.

In 2022, &quot;Confessions of a Shinagawa Monkey&quot; was translated into Yorùbá by Nigerian linguist Kola Tubosun, making it the first time a Murakami story would be translated into an African language.

In 2023, Jean-Christophe Deveney began adapting nine of Murakami&#x27;s short stories into a three-volume original English-language manga series illustrated by PGML and published by Tuttle Publishing. The first and second volumes of &quot;Haruki Murakami Manga Stories&quot; adapt &quot;Super-Frog Saves Tokyo&quot;, &quot;The Seventh Man&quot;, &quot;Birthday Girl&quot;, &quot;Where I&#x27;m Likely to Find It&quot;, &quot;The Second Bakery Attack&quot;, &quot;Samsa in Love&quot;, and &quot;Thailand&quot;, while the upcoming final volume will adapt &quot;Scheherezade&quot; and &quot;Sleep&quot;.

==Personal life==
After receiving the Gunzo Award for his 1979 literary work &quot;Hear the Wind Sing&quot;, Murakami did not aspire to meet other writers. Aside from Sarah Lawrence&#x27;s Mary Morris, whom he briefly mentions in his memoir &quot;What I Talk About When I Talk About Running&quot; alongside Joyce Carol Oates and Toni Morrison, Murakami was never a part of a community of writers, his reason being that he was a loner and was never fond of groups, schools, and literary circles. When working on a book, Murakami states that he relies on his wife, who is always his first reader. While he never acquainted himself with many writers, among the contemporary writers, he enjoys the work of Kazuo Ishiguro, Cormac McCarthy, Lee Child and Dag Solstad. While he does not read much contemporary Japanese literature, Murakami enjoys the works of Ryū Murakami and Banana Yoshimoto.

Murakami enjoys baseball and describes himself as a fan of the Tokyo Yakult Swallows. In his 2015 essay for Literary Hub &quot;The Moment I Became a Novelist&quot;, Murakami describes how attending a Swallow&#x27;s game in Jingu Stadium in 1978 led to a personal epiphany in which he decided to write his first novel.

Haruki Murakami is a fan of crime novels. During his high school days while living in Kōbe, he would buy paperbacks from second hand book stores and learned to read English. The first book that he read in English was &quot;The Name is Archer&quot;, written by Ross Macdonald in 1955. Other writers he was interested in included Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky.

Murakami also has a passion for listening to music, especially classical and jazz. When he was around 15, he began to develop an interest in jazz after attending an Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers concert in Kobe. He later opened the Peter Cat, a coffeehouse and jazz bar. Murakami has said that music, like writing, is a mental journey. At one time he aspired to be a musician, but because he could not play instruments well he decided to become a writer instead.

In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Murakami stated his belief that his surreal books appeal to people especially in times of turmoil and political chaos. He stated that &quot;I was so popular in the 1990s in Russia, at the time they were changing from the Soviet Union – there was big confusion, and people in confusion like my books&quot; and “In Germany, when the Berlin Wall fell down, there was confusion – and people liked my books.”

==Political views==
Murakami told &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; in 2011, &quot;I think of myself as a political person, but I don&#x27;t state my political messages to anybody.&quot; Comparing himself to George Orwell, he views himself as standing &quot;against the system.&quot; In 2009, whilst accepting an award in Israel, he expressed his political views as:

If there is a hard, high wall and an egg that breaks against it, no matter how right the wall or how wrong the egg, I will stand on the side of the egg. Why? Because each of us is an egg, a unique soul enclosed in a fragile egg. Each of us is confronting a high wall. The high wall is the system which forces us to do the things we would not ordinarily see fit to do as individuals.

Murakami stated that it is natural for China and the Koreas to continue to feel resentment towards Japan for its wartime aggressions. &quot;Fundamentally, Japanese people tend not to have an idea that they were also assailants, and the tendency is getting clearer,&quot; he said. In another interview, Murakami stated: &quot;The issue of historical understanding carries great significance, and I believe it is important that Japan makes straightforward apologies. I think that is all Japan can do – apologise until the countries say: &#x27;We don&#x27;t necessarily get over it completely, but you have apologised enough. Alright, let&#x27;s leave it now.&#x27;&quot;

In January 2015, Murakami expressed support for same-sex marriage, which is not recognised in Japan, when responding to a reader&#x27;s question about his stance on the issue.

In August 2021, during one of his radio shows, Murakami criticized prime minister Yoshihide Suga over the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, suggesting Suga had ignored a surge in Covid cases and public concerns about the state of the pandemic. Murakami quoted Suga as saying &quot;an exit is now in our sight after a long tunnel&quot; and added, in criticism, that &quot;If he really saw an exit, his eyes must be extremely good for his age. I&#x27;m of the same age as Mr. Suga, but I don&#x27;t see any exit at all.&quot;

In 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which was part of the larger Russian-Ukrainian war, Murakami called for peace. He prepared a special radio program calling for peace. Murakami featured there around ten musical pieces that encourage to end the war and &quot;focus on the preciousness of life&quot;.

==Bibliography==

;Notes
===Murakami in popular culture and academia===
* In 2021, Tokyo&#x27;s new Haruki Murakami library at Waseda University was opened featuring Murakami&#x27;s impressive global archive. 

* &quot;In 2022, In Statu Nascendi&quot; published a special edition [edited by Joseph Thomas Milburn and Piotr Pietrzak] on Haruki Murakami to deliberate on the special relation between philosophy and an acclaimed Japanese literary writer. They argue that Murakami himself has been reluctant to expound on any deeper meaning to be found in his stories. The answer can be found in the great interest in and diverse engagement of readers with Murakami&#x27;s work.

By 2008, there were three non-fiction scholarly books in English about Murakami and his works. Timothy J. Van Compernolle of Amherst College wrote that the fact that many such books existed about &quot;a living author in the relatively small field of Japanese literary studies in the English-speaking world is unprecedented.&quot;

<doc id="229201" wikidata="Q107473" url="?curid=229201" title="Karl Barth">
<text>Karl Barth (; ; – ) was a Swiss Reformed theologian. Barth is best known for his commentary &quot;The Epistle to the Romans&quot;, his involvement in the Confessing Church, including his authorship (except for a single phrase) of the Barmen Declaration, and especially his unfinished multi-volume theological summa the &quot;Church Dogmatics&quot; (published between 1932–1967). Barth&#x27;s influence expanded well beyond the academic realm to mainstream culture, leading him to be featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; on 20 April 1962.

Like many Protestant theologians of his generation, Barth was educated in a liberal theology influenced by Adolf von Harnack, Friedrich Schleiermacher and others. His pastoral career began in the rural Swiss town of Safenwil, where he was known as the &quot;Red Pastor from Safenwil&quot;. There he became increasingly disillusioned with the liberal Christianity in which he had been trained. This led him to write the first edition of his &quot;The Epistle to the Romans&quot; (a.k.a. Romans I), published in 1919, in which he resolved to read the New Testament differently.

Barth began to gain substantial worldwide acclaim with the publication in 1921 of the second edition of his commentary, &quot;The Epistle to the Romans&quot;, in which he openly broke from liberal theology.

He influenced many significant theologians such as Dietrich Bonhoeffer who supported the Confessing Church, and Jürgen Moltmann, Helmut Gollwitzer, James H. Cone, Wolfhart Pannenberg, Rudolf Bultmann, Thomas F. Torrance, Hans Küng, and also Reinhold Niebuhr, Jacques Ellul, and novelists such as Flannery O&#x27;Connor, John Updike, and Miklós Szentkuthy.

Among many other areas, Barth has also had a profound influence on modern Christian ethics, influencing the work of ethicists such as Stanley Hauerwas, John Howard Yoder, Jacques Ellul and Oliver O&#x27;Donovan.

==Early life and education==
Karl Barth was born on 10 May 1886, in Basel, Switzerland, to Johann Friedrich &quot;Fritz&quot; Barth (1852–1912) and Anna Katharina (Sartorius) Barth (1863–1938). Karl had two younger brothers, Peter Barth (1888–1940) and Heinrich Barth (1890–1965), and two sisters, Katharina and Gertrude. Fritz Barth was a theology professor and pastor and desired for Karl to follow his positive line of Christianity, which clashed with Karl&#x27;s desire to receive a liberal Protestant education. Karl began his student career at the University of Bern, and then transferred to the University of Berlin to study under Adolf von Harnack, and then transferred briefly to the University of Tübingen before finally in Marburg to study under Wilhelm Herrmann (1846–1922).

From 1911 to 1921, Barth served as a Reformed pastor in the village of Safenwil in the canton of Aargau. In 1913 he married Nelly Hoffmann, a talented violinist. They had a daughter and four sons, two of whom were Biblical scholars and theologians Markus (6 October 1915 – 1 July 1994) and (29 September 1917 – 21 August 1986). Later Karl Barth was professor of theology in Göttingen (1921–1925), Münster (1925–1930) and Bonn (1930–1935), in Germany. While serving at Göttingen he met Charlotte von Kirschbaum, who became his long-time secretary, assistant and lover; she lived in the family home for 37 years and played a large role in the writing of his epic, the &quot;Church Dogmatics&quot;. He was deported from Germany in 1935 after he refused to sign (without modification) the Oath of Loyalty to Adolf Hitler and went back to Switzerland and became a professor in Basel (1935–1962).

==Break from liberal theology==

Liberal theology (German: &quot;moderne Theologie&quot;) was a trend in nineteenth and early twentieth-century Protestant theology to reinterpret traditional beliefs in two ways. First, it adopted an historical-critical approach to the sources of Christianity. Second, it engaged with the questions that science, philosophy and other disciplines raised for the Christian faith. Barth&#x27;s striking out on a different theological course from that of his Liberal university teachers Adolf von Harnack and Wilhelm Herrmann was due to several significant influences and events. While Pastor at Safenwil, Barth had an influential friendship with neighbouring pastor Eduard Thurneysen. Troubled that their theological educations had left them ill-equipped to preach God&#x27;s message effectively, they together engaged in an intensive quest to find a &quot;wholly other&quot; theological foundation than that which Schleiermacher had proposed.

In August 1914, Barth was dismayed to learn that his venerated teachers including Adolf von Harnack had signed the &quot;Manifesto of the Ninety-Three German Intellectuals to the Civilized World&quot;. As a result, Barth concluded he could not follow their understanding of the Bible and history any longer. In 1915, Barth and Thurneysen visited Christoph Blumhardt, Leader of the Bad Boll Christian Community and Social Democratic politician. Their conversation made a deep impression on Barth. He later commented that &quot;Blumhardt always begins with God&#x27;s presence, power, and purpose,&quot; which indicates a likely influence in shaping his own theocentric starting-point. Barth also found in Blumhardt&#x27;s pro-Socialist politics an inspiring encouragement for his own advocacy for the rights and unionization of Safenwil textile workers and alignment with Social Democratic values. These activities, and a public disagreement with a local factory owner, earned him local notoriety as the &#x27;Red Pastor&#x27;.

Barth&#x27;s theological response was to adopt a Dialectical approach in which he deliberately sought to interrupt and destabilize the assumptions of Liberal theology by a method of negation and affirmation. In a lecture delivered in Arau in 1916, Barth argued that &quot;God&#x27;s righteousness is revealed like a trumpet blast from another world that interrupts one&#x27;s obligation to nation, and also interrupts the nurturing of religious thoughts and feelings. A &#x27;No&#x27; to these assumptions knocks one to the floor, but a &#x27;Yes&#x27; to God&#x27;s righteousness and glory sets one on one&#x27;s feet again.&quot; Although in one sense it is accurate to say that Barth&#x27;s Dialectical approach sought deliberately to destabilize the assumptions of Liberal theology; in another sense it is important to acknowledge that Barth never totally repudiated the historical-critical approach to the Scriptures. In addition, he continued to engage with the questions that other disciplines raised for the Christian faith, typically responding with a robust theological and Christ-centered approach.

==&quot;The Epistle to the Romans&quot;==
Barth first began his commentary &quot;The Epistle to the Romans&quot; () in the summer of 1916 while he was still a pastor in Safenwil, with the first edition appearing in December 1918 (but with a publication date of 1919). On the strength of the first edition of the commentary, Barth was invited to teach at the University of Göttingen. Barth decided around October 1920 that he was dissatisfied with the first edition and heavily revised it the following eleven months, finishing the second edition around September 1921. Particularly in the thoroughly re-written second edition of 1922, Barth argued that the God who is revealed in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus challenges and overthrows any attempt to ally God with human cultures, achievements, or possessions. The book&#x27;s popularity led to its republication and reprinting in several languages.

==Barmen Declaration==
In 1934, as the Protestant Church attempted to come to terms with Nazi Germany, Barth was largely responsible for the writing of the Barmen Declaration (). This declaration rejected the influence of Nazism on German Christianity by arguing that the Church&#x27;s allegiance to the God of Jesus Christ should give it the impetus and resources to resist the influence of other lords, such as the German , Adolf Hitler. Barth mailed this declaration to Hitler personally. This was one of the founding documents of the Confessing Church and Barth was elected a member of its leadership council, the Bruderrat.

He was forced to resign from his professorship at the University of Bonn in 1935 for refusing to swear an oath to Hitler. Barth then returned to his native Switzerland, where he assumed a chair in systematic theology at the University of Basel. In the course of his appointment, he was required to answer a routine question asked of all Swiss civil servants: whether he supported the national defence. His answer was, &quot;Yes, especially on the northern border!&quot; The newspaper Neue Zürcher Zeitung carried his 1936 criticism of the philosopher Martin Heidegger for his support of the Nazis. In 1938 he wrote a letter to a Czech colleague Josef Hromádka in which he declared that soldiers who fought against Nazi Germany were serving a Christian cause.

==&quot;Church Dogmatics&quot;==

Barth&#x27;s theology found its most sustained and compelling expression in his five-volume &quot;magnum opus&quot;, the &quot;Church Dogmatics&quot; (). Widely regarded as an important theological work, the &quot;Church Dogmatics&quot; represents the pinnacle of Barth&#x27;s achievement as a theologian. &quot;Church Dogmatics&quot; runs to over six million words and 9,000 pages – one of the longest works of systematic theology ever written. The &quot;Church Dogmatics&quot; is in five volumes: the Doctrine of the Word of God, the Doctrine of God, the Doctrine of Creation, the Doctrine of Reconciliation and the Doctrine of Redemption. Barth&#x27;s planned fifth volume was never written and the fourth volume&#x27;s final part-volume was unfinished.

==Later life and death==

After the end of the Second World War, Barth became an important voice in support both of German penitence and of reconciliation with churches abroad. Together with Hans Iwand, he authored the in 1947a more concrete statement of German guilt and responsibility for Nazi Germany and the Second World War than the 1945 Stuttgart Declaration of Guilt. In it, he made the point that the Church&#x27;s willingness to side with anti-socialist and conservative forces had led to its susceptibility to Nazi ideology. In the context of the developing Cold War, that controversial statement was rejected by anti-Communists in the West who supported the Christian Democratic Union of Germany course of re-militarization, as well as by East German dissidents who believed that it did not sufficiently depict the dangers of Communism. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1950. In the 1950s, Barth sympathized with the peace movement and opposed West German rearmament. Barth was exempted from a regulation that limited the tenure of a professorship at the University of Basel to the year they were 70 years of age, which he would have reached in 1956. 

Barth wrote a 1960 article for &quot;The Christian Century&quot; regarding the &quot;East–West question&quot; in which he denied any inclination toward Eastern communism and stated he did not wish to live under Communism or wish anyone to be forced to do so; he acknowledged a fundamental disagreement with most of those around him, writing: &quot;I do not comprehend how either politics or Christianity require [sic] or even permit such a disinclination to lead to the conclusions which the West has drawn with increasing sharpness in the past 15 years. I regard anticommunism as a matter of principle an evil even greater than communism itself.&quot;

In 1962, Barth visited the United States and lectured at Princeton Theological Seminary, the University of Chicago, the Union Theological Seminary and the San Francisco Theological Seminary. He was invited to be a guest at the Second Vatican Council. At the time Barth&#x27;s health did not permit him to attend. However, he was able to visit the Vatican and be a guest of the pope in 1967, after which he wrote the small volume (&quot;At the Threshold of the Apostles&quot;).

Barth was featured on the cover of the 20 April 1962 issue of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, an indication that his influence had reached out of academic and ecclesiastical circles and into mainstream American religious culture. Pope Pius XII is sometimes claimed to have called Barth &quot;the greatest theologian since Thomas Aquinas&quot;, though Fergus Kerr observes that &quot;there is never chapter and verse for the quotation&quot; and it is sometimes attributed to Pope Paul VI instead.

Barth died on 10 December 1968, at his home in Basel, Switzerland. The evening before his death, he had encouraged his lifelong friend Eduard Thurneysen that he should not be downhearted, &quot;For things are ruled, not just in Moscow or in Washington or in Peking, but things are ruled – even here on earth—entirely from above, from heaven above.&quot;

==Theology==
Karl Barth&#x27;s most significant theological work is his summa theology titled the &quot;Church Dogmatics&quot;, which contains Barth&#x27;s doctrine of the word of God, doctrine of God, doctrine of reconciliation and doctrine of redemption. Barth is most well known for reorienting all theological discussion around Jesus.

===Trinitarian focus===
One major objective of Barth is to recover the doctrine of the Trinity in theology from its putative loss in liberalism. His argument follows from the idea that God is the object of God&#x27;s own self-knowledge, and revelation in the Bible means the self-unveiling to humanity of the God who cannot be discovered by humanity simply through its own intuition. God&#x27;s revelation comes to man &#x27;vertically from above&#x27; ().

===Election===
One of the most influential and controversial features of Barth&#x27;s Dogmatics was his doctrine of election (&quot;Church Dogmatics&quot; II/2). Barth&#x27;s theology entails a rejection of the idea that God chose each person to either be saved or damned based on purposes of the Divine will, and it was impossible to know why God chose some and not others.

Barth&#x27;s doctrine of election involves a firm rejection of the notion of an eternal, hidden decree. In keeping with his Christo-centric methodology, Barth argues that to ascribe the salvation or damnation of humanity to an abstract absolute decree is to make some part of God more final and definitive than God&#x27;s saving act in Jesus Christ. God&#x27;s absolute decree, if one may speak of such a thing, is God&#x27;s gracious decision to be for humanity in the person of Jesus Christ. Drawing from the earlier Reformed tradition, Barth retains the notion of double predestination but makes Jesus himself the object of both divine election and reprobation simultaneously; Jesus embodies both God&#x27;s election of humanity and God&#x27;s rejection of human sin. While some regard this revision of the doctrine of election as an improvement on the Augustinian-Calvinist doctrine of the predestination of individuals, critics, namely Emil Brunner, have charged that Barth&#x27;s view amounts to a soft universalism, thereby departing from Augustinian-Calvinism.

Barth&#x27;s doctrine of objective atonement develops as he distances himself from Anselm of Canterbury&#x27;s doctrine of the atonement. In &quot;The Epistle to the Romans&quot;, Barth endorses Anselm&#x27;s idea that God who is robbed of his honor must punish those who robbed him. In &quot;Church Dogmatics&quot; I/2, Barth advocates divine freedom in the incarnation with the support of Anselm&#x27;s . Barth holds that Anselm&#x27;s doctrine of the atonement preserves both God&#x27;s freedom and the necessity of Christ&#x27;s incarnation. The positive endorsement of Anselmian motives in continues in &quot;Church Dogmatics&quot; II/1. Barth maintains with Anselm that the sin of humanity cannot be removed by the merciful act of divine forgiveness alone. In &quot;Church Dogmatics&quot; IV/1, however, Barth&#x27;s doctrine of the atonement diverges from that of Anselm. By over-christologizing the doctrine, Barth completes his formulation of objective atonement. He finalizes the necessity of God&#x27;s mercy at the place where Anselm firmly establishes the dignity and freedom of the will of God. In Barth&#x27;s view, God&#x27;s mercy is identified with God&#x27;s righteousness in a distinctive way where God&#x27;s mercy always takes the initiative. The change in Barth&#x27;s reception of Anselm&#x27;s doctrine of the atonement is, therefore, alleged to show that Barth&#x27;s doctrine entails support for universalism.

===Salvation===
Barth argued that previous perspectives on sin and salvation, influenced by strict Calvinist thinking, sometimes misled Christians into thinking that predestination set up humanity such that the vast majority of human beings were foreseen to disobey and reject God, with damnation coming to them as a matter of fate.

Barth&#x27;s view of salvation is centrally Christological, with his writings stating that in Jesus Christ the reconciliation of all of mankind to God has essentially already taken place and that through Christ man is already elect and justified.

Karl Barth denied that he was a Universalist: &quot;I do not believe in universalism, but I do believe in Jesus Christ, reconciler of all&quot;. However, Barth asserted that eternal salvation for everyone, even those that reject God, is a possibility that is not just an open question but should be hoped for by Christians as a matter of grace; specifically, he wrote, &quot;Even though theological consistency might seem to lead our thoughts and utterances most clearly in this direction, we must not arrogate to ourselves that which can be given and received only as a free gift&quot;, just hoping for total reconciliation.

Barth, in the words of a later scholar, went a &quot;significant step beyond traditional theology&quot; in that he argued against more conservative strains of Protestant Christianity in which damnation is seen as an absolute certainty for many or most people. To Barth, Christ&#x27;s grace is central.

===Understanding of Mary===

Unlike many Protestant theologians, Barth wrote on the topic of Mariology (the theological study of Mary). Barth&#x27;s views on the subject agreed with much Catholic dogma but he disagreed with the Catholic veneration of Mary. Aware of the common dogmatic tradition of the early Church, Barth fully accepted the dogma of Mary as the Mother of God, seeing a rejection of that title equivalent to rejecting the doctrine that Christ&#x27;s human and divine natures are inseparable (contra the Nestorian heresy). Through Mary, Jesus belongs to the human race. Through Jesus, Mary is Mother of God.

=== Criticism by reformed conservatives===
Barth&#x27;s doctrine of scripture was criticised by reformed theologians such as Cornelius Van Til, Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones and others in the confessional reformed tradition. Chapter VIII of Van Til&#x27;s, Christianity and Barthianism (1962), critiques Barth&#x27;s view of revelation and das Wort Gottes (&#x27;the Word of God&#x27;).

==Charlotte von Kirschbaum==

Charlotte von Kirschbaum was Barth&#x27;s theological academic colleague for more than three decades. George Hunsinger summarizes the influence of von Kirschbaum on Barth&#x27;s work: &quot;As his unique student, critic, researcher, adviser, collaborator, companion, assistant, spokesperson, and confidante, Charlotte von Kirschbaum was indispensable to him. He could not have been what he was, or have done what he did, without her.&quot;

 In 2017 Christiane Tietz examined intimate letters written by Barth, Charlotte von Kirschbaum, and Nelly Barth, which discuss the complicated relationship between all three individuals that occurred over the span of 40 years, released by Barth&#x27;s children. The letters between von Kirschbaum and Barth from 1925 to 1935 made public &quot;the deep, intense, and overwhelming love between these two human beings,&quot; through the lengthy period in which von Kirschbaum lived in the same house as Barth and his wife Nelly. In them, Barth describes a permanent conflict between his marriage and his affections for von Kirschbaum: &quot;The way I am, I never could and still cannot deny either the reality of my marriage or the reality of my love. It is true that I am married, that I am a father and a grandfather. It is also true that I love. And it is true that these two facts don&#x27;t match. This is why we, after some hesitation at the beginning, decided not to solve the problem with a separation on one or the other side.&quot; When Charlotte von Kirschbaum died in 1975, Barth&#x27;s wife Nelly buried Charlotte in the family tomb. Nelly died the following year.

The publication of the letters in English caused a considerable crisis in English-speaking followers of Barth, who largely were not aware of the love triangle and the extent to which Barth and von Kirschbaum may not have been able to fully live according to their theological statements on marriage. Von Kirschbaum&#x27;s early financial dependence on Barth has been posed as a moral problem.

==Center for Barth Studies==
Princeton Theological Seminary, where Barth lectured in 1962, houses the Center for Barth Studies, which is dedicated to supporting scholarship related to the life and theology of Karl Barth. The Barth Center was established in 1997 and sponsors seminars, conferences, and other events. It also holds the Karl Barth Research Collection, the largest in the world, which contains nearly all of Barth&#x27;s works in English and German, several first editions of his works, and an original handwritten manuscript by Barth.

<text>Pernilla Nina Elisabet Wahlgren (; born 24 December 1967) is a Swedish singer and actress. She has sung in Melodifestivalen several times; her 1985 entry titled &quot;Piccadilly Circus&quot; became popular and successful. She has acted in several plays and films, playing roles including Esmeralda in the Academy Award-winning &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot;. She has twice received the Guldmasken award for her work in theater.

==Career==

===Acting===
Wahlgren&#x27;s first acting job, at the age of four, was alongside her mother in the television play &quot;Den längsta dagen&quot; (). She attended Adolf Fredrik&#x27;s Music School and was also part of the Saltsjöbaden theater. After playing a small role in &quot;Lilla prinsen&quot; () at Saltsjöbaden&#x27;s theater, and in the face of stiff competition, Wahlgren got the title role in the musical &quot;Annie&quot; at Folkan, Stockholm. She then played Esmeralda in Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s film &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot;.

In 1982, she joined the cast of the Swedish production of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, in which she played Louise. At Folkan, she also had parts in &quot;Karlsson på taket&quot; (&quot;Karlsson-on-the-Roof&quot;), &quot;Mio, min Mio&quot; (&quot;Mio in the Land of Faraway&quot;), &quot;Snövit&quot; (&quot;Snow White&quot;) and &quot;Ringens hemlighet&quot; (). Wahlgren played Annika in the musical version of &quot;Pippi Longstocking&quot; at Folket in Stockholm; for the two final performances she replaced Siw Malmkvist in the role of Pippi, for which she received positive reviews. In her youth and as an adult Wahlgren portrayed Pippi Longstocking several times. Wahlgren appeared in an episode of &quot;Nygammalt&quot; in 1983 and an episode of &quot;Razzel&quot; in October 1984, where she performed her debut single, &quot;Nu har det tänt&quot;. She has also appeared in film and television productions including Bo Widerberg&#x27;s 1986 production of &quot;Ormens väg på hälleberget&quot; (&quot;The Serpent&#x27;s Way&quot;) and &quot;Snoken&quot; in 1995.

Wahlgren has appeared in theatrical comedies in Stockholm, including &quot;Parneviks cirkusparty&quot; (), &quot;Spanska flugan&quot; () and &quot;Bubbel trubbel&quot; ().

Wahlgren&#x27;s musical breakthrough came when she participated in Melodifestivalen 1985. Her song &quot;Piccadilly Circus&quot; became a public favorite, but she was placed fourth in the competition. Wahlgren participated in Melodifestivalen 1991 with the song &quot;Tvillingsjäl&quot;, which did not make it to the second round of voting. In 2003, she again took part in Melodifestivalen, this time with Jan Johansen; they achieved second place with the song &quot;Let Your Spirit Fly&quot;.

<doc id="229206" wikidata="Q832010" url="?curid=229206" title="Tennis at the 1900 Summer Olympics">
<text>Four tennis events were contested at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, France. These were played at the Cercle des Sports de l&#x27;Île de Puteaux. All four events were won by British players. 26 tennis players from 4 nations competed, with over half from the host nation of France.

The field was small but of high quality, particularly with the top British players present. The Doherty brothers, Reginald and Laurence, were the premier players; they won the men&#x27;s doubles together, Laurence won the men&#x27;s singles (after Reginald withdrew rather than play his brother in the semifinals), and Reginald partnered with Charlotte Cooper to take gold in the mixed doubles.

The tournament organization was uncertain, with no venue guaranteed until 5 days before the events began. The ten-court l&#x27;Île de Puteaux club eventually agreed to host the tournaments. Five of the courts were used, with court #5 the primary one.

<doc id="229208" wikidata="Q333528" url="?curid=229208" title="George Gascoigne">
<text>George Gascoigne (c. 15357 October 1577) was an English poet, soldier and unsuccessful courtier. He is considered the most important poet of the early Elizabethan era, following Sir Thomas Wyatt and Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey and leading to the emergence of Philip Sidney. He was the first poet to deify Queen Elizabeth I, in effect establishing her cult as a virgin goddess married to her kingdom and subjects. His most noted works include &quot;A Discourse of the Adventures of Master FJ&quot; (1573), an account of courtly intrigue and one of the earliest English prose fictions; &quot;The Supposes&quot;, (performed in 1566, printed in 1573), an early translation of Ariosto and the first comedy written in English prose, which was used by Shakespeare as a source for &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;; the frequently anthologised short poem &quot;Gascoignes woodmanship&quot; (1573) and &quot;Certayne Notes of Instruction concerning the making of verse or
ryme in English&quot; (1575), the first essay on English versification.

==Early life==
The eldest son of Sir John Gascoigne of Cardington, Bedfordshire, Gascoigne was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, and on leaving the university is supposed to have joined the Middle Temple. He became a member of Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1555. He has been identified without much show of evidence with a lawyer named Gastone who was in prison in 1548 under very discreditable circumstances. There is no doubt that his escapades were notorious, and that he was imprisoned for debt. George Whetstone says that Sir John Gascoigne disinherited his son on account of his follies, but by his own account he was obliged to sell his patrimony to pay the debts contracted at court. He was MP for Bedford in 1557–1558 and 1558–1559, but when he presented himself in 1572 for election at Midhurst he was refused on the charges of being &quot;a defamed person and noted for manslaughter&quot;, &quot;a common Rymer and a deviser of slaunderous Pasquelles&quot;, &quot;a notorious rufilanne&quot;, and a constantly indebted atheist.

His poems, with the exception of some commendatory verses, were not published before 1572, but they may have circulated in manuscript before that date. He tells us that his friends at Gray&#x27;s Inn importuned him to write on Latin themes set by them, and that two of his plays were acted there. He repaired his fortunes by marrying the wealthy widow of William Breton, thus becoming stepfather to the poet, Nicholas Breton. In 1568 an inquiry into the disposition of William Breton&#x27;s property with a view to the protection of the children&#x27;s rights was instituted before the Lord Mayor, but the matter was probably settled in a friendly manner, for Gascoigne continued to hold the Breton Walthamstow estate, which he had from his wife, until his death.

==Plays at Gray&#x27;s Inn==
Gascoigne translated two plays performed in 1566 at Gray&#x27;s Inn, the most aristocratic of the Renaissance London Inns of Court: the prose comedy &quot;Supposes&quot; based on Ariosto&#x27;s &quot;Suppositi&quot;, and &quot;Jocasta&quot;, a tragedy in blank verse which is said to have derived from Euripides&#x27;s &quot;Phoenissae&quot;, but appears more directly as a translation from the Italian of Lodovico Dolce&#x27;s &quot;Giocasta&quot;.

==&quot;A Hundreth Sundry Flowres&quot; (1573) and &quot;Posies of Gascoigne&quot; (1575)==
Gascoigne&#x27;s best known and controversial work was originally published in 1573 under the title by London printer Richarde Smith. The book purports to be an anthology of courtly poets, gathered and edited by Gascoigne and two other editors known only by the initials &quot;H.W.&quot; and &quot;G.T.&quot; The book&#x27;s content is throughout suggestive of courtly scandal, and the aura of scandal is skilfully elaborated through the effective use of initials and posies—Latin or English tags supposed to denote particular authors—in place of the real names of actual or alleged authors.

Judged to be offensive, the book was &quot;seized by Her Majesty&#x27;s High Commissioners.&quot; Gascoigne republished the book with certain additions and deletions two years later under the alternative title, &quot;The Posies of George Gascoigne, Esquire&quot;. The new edition contains three new dedicatory epistles, signed by Gascoigne, which apologise for the offence that the original edition had caused. This effort failed, however, as the book was also ruled offensive and likewise seized.

==At war in the Netherlands==
When Gascoigne sailed as a soldier of fortune to the Low Countries in 1572, his ship was driven by stress of weather to Brielle, which luckily for him had just fallen into the hands of the Dutch. He obtained a captain&#x27;s commission, and took an active part in the campaigns of the next two years including the Middelburg siege, during which he acquired a profound dislike of the Dutch, and a great admiration for William of Orange, who had personally intervened on his behalf in a quarrel with his colonel, and secured him against the suspicion caused by his clandestine visits to a lady at the Hague.
Taken prisoner after the evacuation of Valkenburg by English troops during the Siege of Leiden, he was sent to England in the autumn of 1574. He dedicated to Lord Grey de Wilton the story of his adventures, &quot;The Fruites of Warres&quot; (printed in the edition of 1575) and &quot;Gascoigne&#x27;s Voyage into Hollande.&quot; In 1575 he had a share in devising the masques, published in the next year as &quot;The Princely Pleasures at the Courte at Kenelworth&quot;, written to celebrate the queen&#x27;s 1575 visit to the Earl of Leicester at Kenilworth Castle. At Woodstock in 1575 he delivered a prose speech before Elizabeth, and was present at a reading of the &quot;Pleasant Tale of Hemetes the Hermit,&quot; a brief romance, probably written by the queen&#x27;s host, Sir Henry Lee. At the queen&#x27;s annual gift exchange with members of her court the following New Year&#x27;s, Gascoigne gave her a manuscript of &quot;Hemetes&quot; which he had translated into Latin, Italian, and French. Its frontispiece shows the Queen rewarding the kneeling poet with an accolade and a purse; its motto, &quot;Tam Marti, quam Mercurio&quot;, indicates that he will serve her as a soldier, as a scholar-poet, or as both. He also drew three emblems, with accompanying text in the three other languages. He also translated Jacques du Fouilloux&#x27;s &quot;La Venerie&quot; (1561) into English as &quot;The Noble Arte of Venerie or Hunting&quot; (1575) which was printed together with George Turberville&#x27;s &quot;The Book of Falconrie or Hawking&quot; and is thus sometimes misattributed to Turberville though in fact it was a work by Gascoigne.

==Later writings and influences==
Most of his works were published during the last years of his life after his return from the wars. He died in Stamford in Lincolnshire on 7 October 1577 and was buried on 13 October in the graveyard of St Mary&#x27;s Church, Stamford. 

Gascoigne&#x27;s theory of metrical composition is explained in a short critical treatise, &quot;Certayne notes of instruction concerning the making of verse or ryme in English, written at the request of Master Edouardo Donati,&quot; prefixed to his &quot;Posies&quot; (1575). He acknowledged Chaucer as his master, and differed from the earlier poets of the school of Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey and Thomas Wyatt chiefly in the greater smoothness and sweetness of his verse. In this text, Gascoigne emphasises the importance of &#x27;invention&#x27; in writing a poem: &quot;the rule of invention, which of all other rules is most to be marked&quot;.

<text>The Hungerford massacre was a spree shooting in Wiltshire and Berkshire, United Kingdom, which occurred on 19 August 1987 when 27-year-old Michael Ryan shot and killed sixteen people, including an unarmed police officer and his own mother, before killing himself. No firm motive for the killings has been established.

A report on the massacre, commissioned by Home Secretary Douglas Hurd, found that understaffing and telecommunication problems may have hampered the police response to the developing incident. The killings were committed using legally owned handguns and semi-automatic rifles, and the report stated that existing firearms legislation should be more stringent. Consequently, the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 was passed in the wake of the massacre, banning ownership of semi-automatic centre-fire rifles and restricted the use of shotguns with a capacity of more than three cartridges.

The shootings have been compared to those in Dunblane in 1996, and in Cumbria in 2010, and the Hungerford massacre remains one of the deadliest firearms incidents in British history.

== Shootings ==

=== Wiltshire ===

On the morning of Wednesday 19 August 1987, 27-year-old Michael Ryan drove his silver Vauxhall Astra GTE to Savernake Forest, Wiltshire, to the west of his hometown of Hungerford. In his car were his Beretta pistol, M1 carbine rifle, and Type 56 semi-automatic rifle. That day, 35-year-old Susan Godfrey and her two pre-school children had travelled from Burghfield Common near Reading and were picnicking in the forest. At 12:30 BST, Ryan, openly armed, approached the family. Godfrey placed the children in her car before Ryan walked her at gunpoint into the forest and shot her 13 times with the Beretta. A woman walking in the woods found the children, who introduced themselves to the woman and said &quot;[a] man in black killed my mummy&quot;.

Ryan left the forest and drove east on the A4, stopping to fill both his car and a petrol can at the Golden Arrow petrol station near Froxfield at approximately 12:35. After another customer at the station left, Ryan shot at the cashier from the forecourt using the M1 carbine. He entered the store and attempted to shoot her at point-blank range; either his gun had jammed or the magazine had inadvertently detached. He left the petrol station, driving east into Berkshire. The cashier telephoned 999; this call had been preceded by another emergency call from the previous customer who believed they had seen an armed robbery. Thames Valley Police (TVP) sent two patrol cars to the A4 to investigate. They were at that point unaware of the murder in Savernake Forest, which had been responded to by officers from Wiltshire Police, and there were initially two manhunts underway.

=== Hungerford ===
==== South View and Fairview Road ====
After leaving Froxfield, Ryan returned to the home he shared with his mother on South View in Hungerford. Arriving there at approximately 12:45, he was seen by neighbours who described him as looking upset. Soon after entering his house, one of the witnesses heard gunshots; Ryan had shot the two family dogs. He exited the house with equipment such as ammunition, survival equipment, and a flak jacket. He failed to start his car, and instead returned to the house and set the living room alight using the petrol he purchased from Froxfield; Leaving the house, he headed east on South View towards school playing fields. En route he shot and killed two of his neighbours, Roland and Sheila Mason, with the Type 56 and Beretta respectively. A fourteen-year-old girl, who also lived nearby, heard the noise and went to see what it was; Ryan shot her four times in the legs. She sought first aid from her mother and another nearby resident and survived. Ryan was chastised by a 77-year-old neighbour for &quot;scaring everybody to death&quot; for making noise, although he did not shoot her. Ryan then wounded Marjorie Jackson, one of the people who had seen him arrive home, in her back. She telephoned her friend George White for help, and asked him to collect her husband Ivor from work in Newbury.

Past the playing fields, Ryan walked along a footpath towards the town&#x27;s common. He shot and killed 51-year-old Kenneth Clements with the Type 56. Clements had been walking his dog with his family; the family escaped without injury. At this time, approximately 12:50, police had linked the incident in Froxfield to the many calls they received in Hungerford and instead focused on South View. Ryan returned to South View from the common, and the first police officers to arrive aimed to close both ends of the road to contain a possible gunman. These officers were unarmed, and when Ryan saw the police response he shot one of the officers, PC Roger Brereton, in the chest with the Beretta. Brereton, who was in his patrol car, crashed into a telegraph pole. At 12:58, Ryan shot and killed him with the Type 56 while he was using his radio to report an active shooter.

Still on South View, Ryan next shot at a mother and daughter who had just turned onto the lane in their Volvo. Both were struck, although the mother was able to reverse the car out of the road. Ryan next fired at the two-person crew of an ambulance that was responding to 999 calls on South View; both escaped without major injury. After this, two of Brereton&#x27;s colleagues securing the east end of South View came upon Kenneth Clements&#x27;s son, who informed them that the shooter had continued west on South View. They headed to investigate and Ryan shot at them; one took shelter in a house and the other – with Clements&#x27;s son – drove across the common to safety. At 13:12, this officer radioed to request support from TVP&#x27;s Tactical Firearms Unit (TFU) having seen the firearms Ryan was using. The TFU was on a training exercise in Otmoor, Oxfordshire (approximately from Hungerford) and would not have all its members in attendance until 14:20. The officer, PC Jeremy Wood, set up a makeshift command post on the common, approximately from South View.

Ryan next shot at George White, who was returning from Newbury with Ivor Jackson. White was driving his Toyota into South View when Ryan shot him with the Type 56; he was killed instantly. Jackson sustained severe injuries and feigned death but survived. Ryan then walked to the junction of South View and Fairview Road, where he used the Type 56 to shoot and kill 84-year-old Abdur Khan who was tending his garden. After firing at and injuring a pedestrian on Fairview Road, Ryan headed back towards the common. One of the police officers in attendance made another 999 call, but by this point the telephone network had reached its capacity. On South View, Ryan&#x27;s mother Dorothy, who had been out shopping and running errands, returned in her car to see Michael armed; she shouted for him to stop before he shot her four times, twice at point-blank range. On heading towards the common, a resident of a parallel street shouted at Ryan to &quot;kindly stop that racket&quot;; he responded by shooting her in the groin. At 13:18 PC Wood was joined by two armed police officers at the command post on the common. Two minutes later, they saw Ryan at the War Memorial Recreation Grounds on the edge of the common.

==== Hungerford Common and town centre ====

Near the War Memorial Recreation Grounds, Ryan shot and killed 26-year-old Francis Butler with the Type 56. At this point, Ryan discarded the carbine, it having been inoperable since the shooting in Froxfield. He also temporarily discarded the Type 56, possibly because of spent ammunition, before recovering it. The subsequent murders were committed with the Beretta.

On reaching Bulpit Lane, Ryan shot and killed taxi driver Marcus Barnard, who was in his cab. Ryan headed north on Priory Avenue, where he shot and injured the occupant of a parked van. By this time, police had set up road diversions, and some of Ryan&#x27;s victims were drivers affected by these change of routes. Douglas and Kathleen Wainwright, visiting their son on Priory Avenue, were diverted to approach from the south, where Ryan was. Approximately from their destination, Ryan shot Douglas dead and injured Kathleen before non-fatally shooting at two other drivers. Standing near Priory Avenue&#x27;s junction with Tarrants Hill, Ryan shot at a van, killing Eric Vardy.

At 13:30, Ryan headed via Orchard Park Close to Priory Road, shooting at houses as he passed them. He then shot at a passing car on Priory Road and fatally injured the driver, 22-year-old Sandra Hill.

After shooting Hill, Ryan forced his way into a house further down Priory Road and shot the occupants, 66-year-old Jack Gibbs and his 62-year-old wife Myrtle. Jack was killed instantly, and Myrtle died two days later at the Princess Margaret Hospital in Swindon. Leaving the Gibbs&#x27; home, Ryan shot at houses opposite and injured the occupants. He then continued south on Priory Road where he shot once at a car driven by 34-year-old Ian Playle, who was fatally struck in the neck. His wife and their two children escaped injury; Playle died at the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford two days later.

At 13:45 the police helicopter arrived and broadcast warnings to the public. At this time, Ryan shot and injured a male outside a property on Priory Road.

=== Suicide ===
Ryan was next seen further along Priory Road approaching John O&#x27;Gaunt School, which was closed for the summer holidays. The school&#x27;s caretaker reported seeing a man enter one of the school buildings at 13:52, and the TFU secured gardens and houses in the area before surrounding the school at approximately 16:00. At 16:40 they heard gunshots in the vicinity of the school and more officers went to the scene. At least one further shot from a school building was heard at 17:15; these may have been aimed at the police and press helicopters. Ryan&#x27;s precise location after the shooting at 13:45 had been unknown as there had been no confirmed sightings, but at approximately 17:26 police first saw him at the school shortly after he had thrown his Type 56 out of a third-floor window. Once containment of Ryan was confirmed, fire and ambulance crews were able to access the previously locked-down parts of the town, including the fire in South View, which had spread and destroyed the Ryans&#x27; home as well as the three other properties in the terrace.

Ryan fired at both police and helicopters that were circling above the school. He became engaged in conversation with a sergeant within the TFU and informed them of his arsenal and ammunition, claiming that he had a grenade as well as the Beretta. He said that he would not exit the building until the police informed him of the welfare of his mother and stated that &quot;Hungerford must be a bit of a mess.&quot; The sergeant said he understood Ryan when he claimed that his mother&#x27;s death was &quot;a mistake;&quot; Ryan reportedly replied, &quot;How can you understand? I wish I had stayed in bed.&quot; He later shouted, &quot;It&#x27;s funny. I killed all those people, but I haven&#x27;t the guts to blow my own brains out.&quot; At 18:52, after a few minutes of silence, a shot was heard from the school building, and Ryan no longer responded to police. Without knowing the full extent of Ryan&#x27;s arsenal and ammunition and with the possibility of booby traps or more perpetrators, the police stayed at their positions and devised an operation to enter the building. At 20:00 the plan was enacted, and at 20:10 armed police entered a barricaded room to find Ryan dead of a self-inflicted gunshot through the right temple.

== Aftermath ==
The shootings were declared a major incident and in the immediate aftermath, TVP locked-down many areas to secure evidence and exclude press activity. A CID headquarters was established at the force&#x27;s premises in Sulhamstead, approximately east of Hungerford. They conducted a sweep search of the town, identifying 78 bullet holes in 15 vehicles. Investigations were supported by the force&#x27;s Autoindex system; the HOLMES platform not yet implemented.

Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher visited Hungerford on the day after the massacre. She stated that &quot;if [gun control laws] need to be tightened up [to] prevent more events like this, of course, that will be considered.&quot;

Funerals for the dead were conducted in the weeks after the tragedy, beginning with Eric Vardy&#x27;s in Great Shefford on 26 August. Roger Brereton&#x27;s funeral, held the following day at St Mary&#x27;s Church in Shaw, Berkshire, was attended by Home Secretary Douglas Hurd. Dorothy Ryan was buried in Calne, Wiltshire on 29 August. Michael Ryan was cremated at Reading Crematorium on 3 September; the location of his ashes known to only one member of his family.

=== Inquest and report ===
The inquest into the massacre concluded on 29 September. The coroner for West Berkshire, Charles Hoile, recognised the dichotomy of the nation wanting rapid police response to such events while also insisting on a routinely unarmed police force. The jury in the inquest recommended to the coroner that &quot;semi-automatic weapons should not generally be available [and] an individual should not be allowed to own an unlimited quantity of arms and ammunition.&quot;

Hurd commissioned TVP&#x27;s Chief Constable, Colin Smith, to prepare a report on the incident. The Hungerford Report found that on the day of the massacre, the town – which was usually policed by two sergeants and twelve constables – was policed by one sergeant, two patrol constables, and one station duty officer. It reported that such restrictions in personnel that day &quot;could certainly have become a relevant factor had Ryan not been traced and contained rapidly.&quot;

Communication – both internally within the force as well as handling communications with the public – was criticised. Telephone exchanges could not handle the number of 999 calls made by witnesses; the Newbury exchange normally handled 300,000 calls per day but this increased to 800,000 on 19 August. Some witnesses&#x27; reports were significantly delayed which resulted in out-of-date or duplicate information being passed to emergency services. The public telephone network, as well as lines to the emergency services, were saturated. As a result, British Telecom implemented measures to relieve stress on the telecommunications network on the evening of 19 August, freeing up communications for the police. The force also used 13 mobile telephones; as with the landline network, Racal blocked the public from using the cellular network to allow the police&#x27;s mobile phones to work.

The report suggested that although the police force helicopter was undergoing repairs and did not arrive at Hungerford until 13:45, it was likely a catalyst for Ryan to seek refuge in the school. Smith said that the presence of helicopters other than the police&#x27;s aircraft hampered operations; at least four private helicopters – most (if not all) from the press – were a distraction for the police pilot and made ground units unable to hear radio transmissions.

Regarding Ryan&#x27;s firearms, the report determined that his weapon collection had been legally licensed. Smith concluded that &quot;the public [...] will demand that this tragic event is used as a catalyst for changes in both the law and administrative procedures [of gun licencing]&quot;, and that neither &quot;legitimate sporting [nor] leisure interests&quot; would be seriously damaged nor significantly impeded if semi-automatic firearms were prohibited from general sale.

The report led to the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988, which banned the ownership of semi-automatic centre-fire rifles and restricted the use of shotguns with a capacity of more than three cartridges (in magazine plus the breech). An amnesty held following the passing of the Act amassed 48,000 firearms.

In June 1988, PC Brereton was posthumously awarded the Queen&#x27;s Commendation for Brave Conduct.

== Perpetrator ==

Michael Robert Ryan was born on 18 May 1960, at Savernake Hospital in Marlborough, Wiltshire, the only child of Alfred and Dorothy Ryan. His father (born ) had worked for a local government agency as a building inspector and died from cancer in 1985 at the age of 80. Ryan&#x27;s mother (born 1925 or 1926) worked as a school dinner lady and later as a waitress at the Elcot Park Hotel.

Ryan attended Hungerford Primary School and John O&#x27;Gaunt School before studying at Newbury College from the age of 16. After dropping out of college, some sources state that Ryan was at one point employed as an antique dealer, although this is not corroborated by the official report into the shootings. On 7 April 1987, he began employment as a labourer on a Manpower Services Commission scheme with Newbury District Council, working on footpaths and fences including at the River Thames in Reading. He left the job on 9 July, and returned to claiming benefits.

=== Firearms ownership ===
Ryan was issued a shotgun certificate on 2 February 1978, and on 11 December 1986 he was granted a firearm certificate covering the ownership of two pistols. The licence only permitted Ryan to use the weapons at approved ranges; his application stated that he would use them at the Dunmore Shooting Centre Club in Abingdon and he was also a member of the Wiltshire Shooting Centre rifle club in Devizes. He later applied to have the certificate amended to cover a third pistol, as he intended to sell one of the two he had acquired since the granting of the certificate (a Smith &amp; Wesson .38-caliber revolver) and to buy two more. This was approved on 30 April 1987. On 14 July, he applied for another variation, to cover two semi-automatic rifles, which was approved on 30 July. At the time of the massacre, he was licensed to possess eight firearms, which he purchased between 17 December 1986 and 8 August 1987:
*Beretta 9mm pistol
*Zabala shotgun
* Browning shotgun
* Bernardelli .22 pistol
* CZ ORSO self-loading .32 ACP pistol
* Norinco Type 56 7.62×39mm semi-automatic rifle
* Underwood M1 carbine .30 rifle

Ryan used the Beretta, the Type 56, and the M1 carbine in the massacre, and fired at least 119 bullets. He predominantly used the Type 56, with which he fired 84 bullets.

The CZ pistol was being repaired by a dealer at the time, and he had sold the Bernardelli shortly before the shootings. The Norinco was purchased from firearms dealer Mick Ranger.

Ryan showed some of his firearms – as well as improvised explosive devices – to his colleagues at his labouring job. As well as his target practice at legitimate venues, Ryan used a large road sign at the junction of the M4 and the A338.

=== Health and motive ===
In the hours following the massacre, newspapers speculated that Ryan was inspired by viewing &quot;video nasties&quot; despite there having been no opportunity to investigate such causes. The British tabloid press was filled with stories about Ryan&#x27;s life; biographies stated that as well as watching violent videos he had a near-obsessive fascination with firearms and possessed magazines about survival skills and firearms, including &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot;. The &quot;Rambo&quot; films were later suggested as inspiring Ryan, although there is no evidential link between fictional video violence and the subsequent enactment of actual physical violence.

Ryan had neither previous criminal convictions nor a record of medical problems. Following his death, Ryan&#x27;s mental health came under analysis. Jim Higgins, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, suspected that Ryan had acute schizophrenia, describing how &quot;matricide is the schizophrenic crime.&quot; A psychologist in BBC One&#x27;s &quot;The Hungerford Massacre&quot; documentary described how Ryan had &quot;anger and contempt for ordinary life&quot;.

Although no motive for the massacre has been determined, psychologist Craig Jackson of Birmingham City University has suggested that Ryan may have been sexually motivated in his attack on Godfrey in Savernake Forest; the presence of a groundsheet from where her body was found may have meant that Ryan intended to sexually assault her. Jackson believes that the shootings that followed were not planned as Ryan had no manifesto, but may have been borne out of a desire to control. He may have been influenced, however, by the Hoddle Street massacre in Melbourne, Australia, 10 days previously.

Investigative psychologist Keith Ashcroft likened the massacre to the shootings at Dunblane in 1996 and Cumbria in 2010, stating that &quot;the killers [were] subject to gossip and sometimes quite serious victimisation. Their rage at perceived injustice is way beyond that of a normal person, but they have not lost touch with reality.&quot; Ashcroft differed from Higgins on the possibility of psychosis, stating that &quot;[spree killers] are not psychotic. Isolation, emptiness, is solved by taking control. And the ultimate control is that exercised over life and death. Finally, they externalise their rage, targeting family and society.&quot;

== Legacy ==
The massacre remains, along with the 1996 Dunblane school massacre and the 2010 Cumbria shootings, one of the deadliest mass shootings in the UK and the name &quot;Hungerford&quot; has become synonymous with the massacre.

The Hungerford Tragedy Gardens, adjacent to the town&#x27;s war memorial, were established to memorialise the victims of the massacre. Most residents of Hungerford refer to the events as &quot;the tragedy&quot;. One local stated that &quot;[someone] called it the &#x27;massacre&#x27;[...] that is offensive to people in Hungerford – it was the Hungerford Tragedy – we&#x27;ve always called it the Hungerford Tragedy&quot;. Conversely, Marjorie Jackson – who was injured on South View – does not view the events as a tragedy, stating &quot;It was a massacre[...] there&#x27;s no two ways about it.&quot;

<text>Enzkreis is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in the northwest of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from west clockwise) Karlsruhe, Heilbronn, Ludwigsburg, Böblingen and Calw. The district-free Pforzheim area in the south is nearly completely surrounded by Enz.

==History==
The district was created in 1973, when the previous district Pforzheim was merged with parts of the neighboring districts Vaihingen, Leonberg and Calw. Some part of the district Pforzheim was included into the city Pforzheim.

The district Pforzheim dates back to 1939, when the &quot;Bezirksamt Pforzheim&quot; was split into the district and the district-free city.

==Geography==
The south of the Enz district covers the northern part of the Black Forest. In the north-west of the district is the Kraichgau, a mainly agricultural area. The main river is the Enz, a tributary of the Neckar.

==International relations==
===Twin towns — Sister cities===
Since March 1993, the district has an official partnership with the Italian province Reggio Emilia. Since 1996 the district has a partnership with the Polish city Mysłowice. As two municipalities left the city in a communal reform in 1995, the partnership also includes Imielin and Chelm Slaski. In March 2001 the Enz district together with the city Pforzheim started a friendship with the Hungarian Komitat Györ-Moson-Sopron.

==Coat of arms==
The four diamonds in the coat of arms represent the four historic territories covered by the district: the Black Forest, the Heckengäu, Kraichgau and Stromberg. The wavy line in the middle represent the river Enz, which also gave the name to the district.

<doc id="229212" wikidata="Q319657" url="?curid=229212" title="Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)">
<text>Sir Alexander Mackenzie ( – 12 March 1820) was a Scottish explorer and fur trader known for accomplishing the first crossing of North America north of Mexico by a European in 1793. The Mackenzie River and Mount Sir Alexander are named after him.

As a leading member of the North West Company, he aspired to extend the Company&#x27;s operations into western Canada and selling those furs in China. His hopes thus were intrusions on the monopoly positions of both the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and the East India Company.

==Early life==

Mackenzie was born in Stornoway in Lewis. He was the third of the four children born to Kenneth &#x27;Corc&#x27; Mackenzie (1731–1780) and his wife Isabella MacIver, from another prominent mercantile family in Stornoway. When only 14 years old, Mackenzie&#x27;s father served as an ensign to protect Stornoway during the Jacobite rising of 1745. He later became a merchant and held the tack of Melbost; his grandfather being a younger brother of Murdoch Mackenzie, 6th Laird of Fairburn.

Educated at the same school as Colin Mackenzie, the army officer and first Surveyor General of India, he sailed to New York City with his father to join an uncle, John Mackenzie, in 1774, after his mother died in Scotland. In 1776, during the American War of Independence, his father and uncle resumed their military duties and joined the King&#x27;s Royal Regiment of New York as lieutenants. By 1778, for his safety as a son of loyalists, young Mackenzie was sent, or went accompanied by two aunts, to Montreal. By 1779 (a year before his father&#x27;s death at Carleton Island), Mackenzie had a secured apprenticeship with Finlay, Gregory &amp; Co., one of the most influential fur trading companies in Montreal, which was later administered by Archibald Norman McLeod. In 1787, the company merged with the North West Company.

==Explorations==
===1789 Mackenzie River expedition to the Arctic Ocean===
On behalf of the North West Company, Mackenzie journeyed to Lake Athabasca where, in 1788, he was one of the founders of Fort Chipewyan. He had been sent to replace Peter Pond, a partner in the North West Company. From Pond, he learned that the First Nations people understood that the local rivers flowed to the north-west. Thinking that it would lead to Cook Inlet in Alaska, he set out by canoe on the river known to the local Dene First Nations people as the Dehcho (Mackenzie River), on 3 July 1789. On 14 July he reached the Arctic Ocean, rather than the Pacific. Later, in a letter to his cousin Roderick, he called the waterway &quot;the River Disappointment,&quot; since the river did not prove to be the Northwest Passage, as he had hoped. In fact the story is probably apocryphal, as Mackenzie&#x27;s own and contemporary records merely refer to it as the &quot;Grand River.&quot; The river came to be known as the Mackenzie River in his honour.

===1792–93 Peace River expedition to the Pacific Ocean===
 In 1791, Mackenzie returned to Great Britain to study the new advance in the measurement of longitude. In the aftermath of the Nootka Crisis with Spain, he returned to Canada in 1792, and set out to find a route to the Pacific. Accompanied by two native guides (one named Cancre), his cousin, Alexander MacKay, six Canadian voyageurs (Joseph Landry, Charles Ducette, François Beaulieu, Baptiste Bisson, Francois Courtois, Jacques Beauchamp), and a dog simply referred to as &quot;our dog&quot;, Mackenzie left Fort Chipewyan on 10 October 1792, and travelled via the Pine River to the Peace River. From there he travelled to a fork on the Peace River arriving 1 November where he and his cohorts built a fortification that they resided in over the winter. This later became known as Fort Fork.

Mackenzie left Fort Fork on 9 May 1793, following the route of the Peace River. He crossed the Great Divide and found the upper reaches of the Fraser River, but was warned by the local natives that the Fraser Canyon to the south was unnavigable and populated by belligerent tribes. He was instead directed to follow a grease trail by ascending the West Road River, crossing over the Coast Mountains and descending the Bella Coola River to the sea. He followed this advice and reached the Pacific coast on 20 July 1793, at Bella Coola, British Columbia, on North Bentinck Arm, an inlet of the Pacific Ocean. Having done this, he had completed the first recorded transcontinental crossing of North America north of Mexico, 12 years before Lewis and Clark. He had unknowingly missed meeting George Vancouver at Bella Coola by 48 days.

He had wanted to continue westward out of a desire to reach the open ocean, but was stopped by the hostility of the Heiltsuk people. Hemmed in by Heiltsuk war canoes, he wrote a message on a rock near the water&#x27;s edge of Dean Channel, using a reddish paint made of vermilion and bear grease, and turned back east. The inscription read: &quot;Alex MacKenzie / from Canada / by land / 22d July 1793&quot; (at the time the name Canada was an informal term for the former French territory in what is now southern Quebec and Ontario). The words were later inscribed permanently by surveyors. The site is now Sir Alexander Mackenzie Provincial Park and is designated First Crossing of North America National Historic Site. In 2016, Mackenzie was named a National Historic Person.

He returned the way he had come, arriving at Fort Chipewyan on Aug. 24. He spent the winter there working in the fur trade. The next year he returned to Montreal. Soon after, he travelled to the U.S. and to London. He returned to Montreal and became one of the leading partners of the North West Company. In 1799 he left the Company and travelled to London to lobby on behalf of the Canadian fur trade. In 1800 he returned to Canada and aided in the formation of the New North West Company (also known as the XY Company).

In his journal Mackenzie recorded the Carrier language for the first time.

==Later life and family==
In 1801 he returned to London and that year the journals of his exploratory journeys were published. (They were later reprinted.) 

He then presented a detailed plan of his west coast project to the British government &quot;Preliminaries to the Establishment of a Permanent British Fishery and Trade in Furs etc. on the Continent and West Coast of North America.&quot; The British government, at the time predicting conflict with Napoleon, took no action. (Later Simon Fraser and David Thompson worked to extend the Canadian fur trade and prevent U.S. incursion in what would be Canada.) 

Mackenzie was knighted in 1802. 

He returned to Canada, where as Sir Mackenzie, he was lionized, He was elected to the Legislature of Lower Canada. He served as member for Huntingdon County from 1804 to 1808.

In 1812 Mackenzie, then aged 48, returned to Scotland, where he married 14-year-old Geddes Mackenzie, twin heiress of Avoch. They had two sons and a daughter. Her grandfather, Captain John Mackenzie of Castle Leod (great-grandson of George Mackenzie, 2nd Earl of Seaforth), purchased the estate of Avoch with money left to him by his first cousin and brother-in-law, Admiral George Geddes Mackenzie. Lady Mackenzie&#x27;s father was a first cousin of the father of George Simpson, Governor of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. The Mackenzies lived alternately in Avoch and London. 

He died in 1820 of Bright&#x27;s disease, at about the age of 56 (his date of birth is unknown). He is buried at Avoch on the Black Isle.

==Legacy==
The Mackenzie River and Mount Sir Alexander are named for him, as is Mackenzie Bay, and the municipality of Mackenzie, British Columbia.

There are a number of schools in Canada named after him, such as Sir Alexander Mackenzie Senior Public School in Toronto, Sir Alexander Mackenzie Elementary School in Vancouver, and Sir Alexander Mackenzie Elementary School in St. Albert. Also Sir Alexander Mackenzie School in the Bella Coola Valley, BC.

He is referenced in the 1981 folk song &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; by Stan Rogers. 

The Alexander Mackenzie rose (Explorer Series), developed in 1985 by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, was named in his honour.

Between 1989 and 1993, the Mackenzie Bicentennial Sea-to-Sea Expeditions of Lakehead University attempted a segmented re-enactment of the journey between Montreal and Bella Coola, British Columbia, but was unable to complete the final overland Grease Trail when its First Nation owners refused permission.
The legend of Mackenzie is a running theme in Boundary Waters (2025) by Tristan Hughes.

<text>Nemesis is a tragedy in four acts written by Alfred Nobel, who founded the Nobel Prizes.

The play, was written shortly before his death in 1896 and printed while he was dying. Following Nobel&#x27;s death the entire printed edition was destroyed, except for three copies. The first surviving edition (bilingual Swedish–Esperanto) was published in Sweden in 2003 and in 2010 it was published in a bilingual Russian–Esperanto edition.

The first, and so far the only, production was at the Intima theatre in Stockholm in 2005.

The play is based on the story of Beatrice Cenci, an Italian noblewoman, who was executed after a plot to murder her father in 1599.

<doc id="229216" wikidata="Q585489" url="?curid=229216" title="Francis Quarles">
<text>Francis Quarles (about 8 May 1592 – 8 September 1644) was an English poet most notable for his emblem book entitled &quot;Emblems&quot;.

==Early life==
Francis Quarles was born in Romford, Essex, and baptised there on 8 May 1592. His family had a long history of royal service. His great-grandfather, George Quarles, was Auditor to King Henry VIII, and his father, James Quarles, was Clerk of the Green Cloth, and Purveyor of the Navy, in Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s reign. His mother, Joan Dalton, was the daughter and heiress of Eldred Dalton of Mores Place, Hadham. Francis grew up in the Manor of Stewards. There were eight children in the family; the eldest, Sir Robert Quarles, was knighted by James I in 1608.

Francis Quarles was entered at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, in 1608, and subsequently joined Lincoln&#x27;s Inn to read for the bar. In 1613, when Princess Elizabeth married Frederick V of the Electoral Palatinate, Quarles was made her cupbearer and went with her to the continent, remaining in post for some years.

==Career==
Some time before 1629, Quarles was appointed as secretary to James Ussher, Archbishop of Armagh and primate of all Ireland.

About 1633, Quarles returned to England, and spent the next two years in the preparation of his &quot;Emblems&quot;. In 1639 he was made city chronologer, a post in which Ben Jonson and Thomas Middleton had preceded him. At the outbreak of the Civil War, he took the Royalist side, drawing up three pamphlets in 1644 in support of the king&#x27;s cause. It is said that his house was searched and his papers destroyed by the Parliamentarians in consequence of these publications.

Quarles married Ursula Woodgate in 1618, by whom he had eighteen children. His son, John Quarles (1624–1665), was exiled to Flanders for his Royalist sympathies and was the author of &quot;Fons Lachrymarum&quot; (1648) and other poems.

The work by which Quarles is best known, the &quot;Emblems&quot;, was originally published in 1634, with grotesque illustrations engraved by William Marshall and others. The forty-five prints in the last three books are borrowed from the designs by Boetius à Bolswert for the &quot;Pia Desideria&quot; (Antwerp, 1624) of Herman Hugo. Each &quot;emblem&quot; consists of a paraphrase from a passage of Scripture, expressed in ornate and metaphorical language, followed by passages from the Christian Fathers, and concluding with an epigram of four lines.

The &quot;Emblems&quot; was immensely popular with readers, but the critics of the 17th and 18th centuries had no mercy on Quarles. Sir John Suckling in his &quot;Sessions of the Poets&quot; disrespectfully alluded to him as he &quot;that makes God speak so big in&#x27;s poetry.&quot; Pope in the &quot;Dunciad&quot; spoke of the Emblems, &quot;Where the pictures for the page atone And Quarles is saved by beauties not his own.&quot;

In 2022 some kitchen re-fitters found murals in a flat on Micklegate in York city centre. Now fully uncovered, they are thought to be based on scenes from Quarles&#x27;s &quot;Emblems&quot;.

==Works==
The works of Quarles include:
*&quot;A Feast for Wormes. Set forth in a Poeme of the History of Jonah&quot; (1620), which contains other scriptural paraphrases, besides the one that furnishes the title; &quot;Hadassa; or the History of Queene Ester&quot; (1621)

*a broadside entitled &quot;A Direfull Anathema against Peace-haters&quot; (1647)

<doc id="229218" wikidata="Q45610" url="?curid=229218" title="Acker Bilk">
<text>Bernard Stanley &quot;Acker&quot; Bilk, (28 January 1929 – 2 November 2014) was an English clarinetist and vocalist known for his breathy, vibrato-rich, lower-register style, and distinctive appearance – of goatee, bowler hat and striped waistcoat.

Bilk&#x27;s 1961 instrumental tune &quot;Stranger on the Shore&quot; became the UK&#x27;s biggest selling single of 1962, spending 55 weeks on the charts and reaching Number 1. It was the first single to top the UK and US charts simultaneously, and the first No. 1 single in the United States by a British artist. In Canada it was number 4 for 4 weeks before peaking at number 3.

==Early life==
Bilk was born in Pensford, Somerset, in 1929. He earned the nickname &quot;Acker&quot; from the Somerset slang for &quot;friend&quot; or &quot;mate&quot;. His parents tried to teach him the piano but, as a boy, Bilk found it restricted his love of outdoor activities, including football. He lost two front teeth in a school fight and half a finger in a sledging accident, both of which he said affected his eventual clarinet style.

On leaving school Bilk joined the workforce of W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills&#x27;s cigarette factory in Bristol; he stayed there for three years, putting tobacco in the cooling room and then pushing tobacco through a blower. He then undertook three years of National Service with the Royal Engineers in the Suez Canal Zone. He learned the clarinet there after his sapper friend, John A. Britten, gave him one bought at a bazaar and for which Britten had no use. The clarinet had no reed, so Britten fashioned a makeshift one for the instrument from scrap wood. Bilk later borrowed a better instrument from the army and kept it after demobilisation. After National Service, Bilk joined his uncle&#x27;s blacksmith business and qualified in the trade.

==Career==
Bilk played with friends on the Bristol jazz circuit and in 1951 moved to London to play with Ken Colyer&#x27;s band. Bilk disliked London, so returned west and formed his own band in Pensford called the Chew Valley Jazzmen, which was renamed the Bristol Paramount Jazz Band when they moved to London in 1951. Their agent then booked them for a six-week gig in Düsseldorf, Germany, playing in a beer bar seven hours a night, seven nights a week. During this time, Bilk and the band developed their distinctive style and appearance, complete with striped waistcoats and bowler hats.

After returning from Germany, Bilk became based in Plaistow, London, and his band played in London jazz clubs. It was from here that Bilk became part of the boom in trad jazz in the United Kingdom in the late 1950s. In 1960, their single &quot;Summer Set&quot; (a pun on their home county), co-written by Bilk and pianist Dave Collett, reached number five on the UK Singles Chart, and began a run of 11 chart hit singles. (&quot;Summer Set&quot; was also used prominently in Daniel Farson&#x27;s controversial 1960 television documentary &quot;Living for Kicks&quot;, a portrait of British teenage life at the time). In 1961 &quot;Acker Bilk and His Paramount Jazz Band&quot; appeared at the Royal Variety Performance.

Bilk was not an internationally known musician until 1962, when the experimental use of a string ensemble on one of his albums and the inclusion of a composition of his own as its keynote piece won him an audience outside the UK. He had composed a melody, entitled &quot;Jenny&quot; after his daughter, but was asked to change the title to &quot;Stranger on the Shore&quot; for use in a British television series of the same name. He went on to record it as the title track of a new album in which his deep and quavering clarinet was backed by the Leon Young String Chorale.

The single was not only a big hit in the United Kingdom, where it stayed on the charts for 55 weeks, helped by Bilk being the subject of the TV show &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, but also topped the American charts. As a result, Bilk was the second British artist to have a single in the number-one position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart. (Vera Lynn was the first, with &quot;Auf Wiederseh&#x27;n Sweetheart&quot; in 1952.) &quot;Stranger on the Shore&quot; sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. At the height of his career, Bilk&#x27;s public relations workers were known as the &quot;Bilk Marketing Board&quot;, a pun on the Milk Marketing Board.

At the height of his international fame in 1962, he appeared in two theatrical motion pictures. &quot;It&#x27;s Trad, Dad!&quot; (released in the United States by Columbia Pictures as &quot;Ring-a-Ding Rhythm&quot;) was a Richard Lester musical combining dixieland and rock-and-roll specialties; &quot;Mr. Acker Bilk&quot; and his band were the best represented, with three songs and a speaking role for Bilk. The second picture, &quot;Band of Thieves&quot;, was a comedy starring &quot;Mr. Acker Bilk&quot; and his group as musicians in prison. His music was also heard on the soundtracks to films such as &quot;Bitter Harvest&quot; (1963), &quot;West 11&quot; (1963), and the musical comedy &quot;It&#x27;s All Over Town&quot; (1964). He also played a cameo role in the latter film.

Bilk&#x27;s success tapered off when British rock and roll made its big international impact beginning in 1964 and he shifted direction to the cabaret circuit. However, he did record a series of well-regarded albums in the mid-1960s. Three of them, including the 1965 collaboration &quot;Together&quot;, with the Danish jazz pianist and composer Bent Fabric (&quot;Alley Cat&quot;), were also released successfully in the United States on the Atlantic Records subsidiary Atco. In 1968 the album &quot;Blue Acker&quot;, produced by Denis Preston and with arrangements by Stan Tracey, illustrated that Bilk remained highly regarded as a musician, even by those (like Tracey) on the &quot;modern jazz&quot; side of things. Duncan Heining rates it as &quot;one of the highlights of British jazz of the period&quot;.

Bilk finally had another chart success in 1976 with &quot;Aria&quot;, which went to number five in the United Kingdom. In May 1977 Bilk and his Paramount Jazz Band provided the interval act for the Eurovision Song Contest. His last chart appearance was in 1978, when the TV-promoted album released on Pye/Warwick, &quot;Evergreen&quot;, reached 17 in a 14-week album chart run. In the early 1980s, Bilk and his signature hit were newly familiar, due to &quot;Stranger on the Shore&quot; being used in the soundtrack to &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;, the film biography of country music singer Patsy Cline. &quot;Aria&quot; featured as a central musical motif in the 2012 Polish film &quot;&quot;.

Bilk continued to tour with his Paramount Jazz Band, as well as performing concerts with his two contemporaries, Chris Barber and Kenny Ball, both of whom were born in 1930, as &quot;The 3Bs&quot;. Bilk also provided vocals on many of his tracks, including on &quot;I&#x27;m an Old Cowhand&quot;, &quot;The Folks Who Live on the Hill&quot;, &quot;White Cliffs of Dover&quot;, &quot;Travellin On&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s My Home&quot;.

He was appointed MBE in 2001 and in 2005 he was awarded the BBC Jazz Awards&#x27; &quot;Gold Award&quot;. One of his recordings was with the Chris Barber band, sharing the clarinet spot with the band&#x27;s regular reedsmen, John Crocker and Ian Wheeler. Bilk made a CD with Wally Fawkes for the Lake label in 2002. He appeared on three albums by Van Morrison: &quot;Down the Road&quot;; &quot;What&#x27;s Wrong With This Picture?&quot;; and &quot;Born to Sing: No Plan B&quot;. In 2012 Bilk said that, after 50 years, he was &quot;fed up&quot; with playing his most famous tune, &quot;Stranger on the Shore&quot;.

Bilk died in Bath, Somerset, on 2 November 2014, at the age of 85. He was survived by his wife and two children. Bilk&#x27;s last recorded interview was for Cornish community station Penwith Radio (now Coast FM) and was broadcast posthumously on Sunday 16 November 2014 at 9:00 pm.

==Personal life==
In 1954 Bilk married his childhood sweetheart, Jean Hawkins, whom he met in the same class at school. The couple had two children, Jenny and Pete. After living near London in Potters Bar for many years, the couple retired to Pensford.

In 1997, Bilk was diagnosed with throat cancer, which was treated through surgery and then followed by daily radiation therapy at Bristol Haematology and Oncology Centre. Subsequently, he had eight keyhole operations for bladder cancer and suffered a minor stroke.

==Other interests==
Bilk was part of a consortium which took over the Oxford Cheetahs speedway team in 1972. They were rebranded as Oxford Rebels as part of the takeover.

==Legacy==
Bilk has been described as the &quot;Great Master of the Clarinet&quot;. &quot;Stranger on the Shore&quot; – which he was once quoted as calling &quot;my old-age pension&quot; – remains a standard of jazz and popular music alike.

Many of these movements were Marxist movements that often took a more vanguardist approach to social justice; focused primarily on labor unionization and social class in the West. Generally, the Old Left, unlike the New, focused more on economic issues than cultural ones. However, seminal figures of the Old Left, such as Lenin, opposed economism. 

While some parties within the Old Left embraced gay rights, influenced by movements like Eurocommunism, others focused on advocating for the working class alone, like the PASOK and the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. 

The emergence of the New Left, which initially originated in the UK, witnessed a shift away from the focus on class struggle and Marxist views of labor. New Left theorists like Herbert Marcuse emphasized instead the liberation of human sexuality.
== Origins==

The Old Left originated in the 19th century during the Industrial Revolution. At a time when few countries even had universal suffrage, the Old Left focused primarily on labor unions and social class. Their stances were economically left-wing, but largely ignored issues commonly linked to cultural liberalism. 

Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels published &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot; in 1848, during the Revolutions of 1848. They proposed the following policies: the abolition of private property in land and inheritance; introduction of a progressive income tax; confiscation of rebels&#x27; property; nationalization of credit, communication, and transport; expansion and integration of industry and agriculture; enforcement of universal obligation of labour; and provision of universal education and abolition of child labour. The text ends with three decisive sentences, reworked and popularized into the famous call for solidarity, the slogan &quot;Workers of the world, unite! You have nothing to lose but your chains&quot;.

Communism was first implemented in the Soviet Union by the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin.

== Social policy ==
Unlike the New Left, the Old Left puts less emphasis on social issues such as identity politics, intersectionality, abortion, drugs, feminism, LGBT rights, environmentalism, immigration and the abolition of the capital punishment; some Old Leftists outright oppose the New Left positions on these issues. Since the mid-1970s with the advent of revisionist movements such as Eurocommunism (and earlier in the Anglosphere, the New Left), some parties on the far left in the West have begun to adopt homosexual rights from the New Left as part of their platform while parties in the East such as the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) and the Communist Party of the Russian Federation have rejected this move and continue to focus exclusively on working class as the Old Left. In 2015, KKE voted against the Civil Partnerships Bill proposed by Syriza, responding: &quot;With the formation of a socialist-communist society, a new type of partnership will undoubtedly be formed—a relatively stable heterosexual relationship and reproduction&quot;.

Militant was a Trotskyist entryist group in the British Labour Party, based around the &quot;Militant&quot; newspaper launched in 1964. According to Michael Crick, its politics were influenced by Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky and &quot;virtually nobody else&quot;. Militant has been cited as an example of left-wing opposition to feminism and gay rights initiatives within the labour movement in the early 1980s, specifically within the context of reaction to the financial support given to gay rights groups by the Greater London Council under the leadership of Ken Livingstone. While Militant was present in Labour Party women&#x27;s sections, claiming forty delegates attended the Labour Party women&#x27;s conference in 1981, it opposed feminism which declared that men were the enemy, or the cause of women&#x27;s oppression.

===Immigration===
The Old Left sometimes took a stance hostile to immigration, promoting policies that would preserve the ethnic homogeneity of the country. Australian Prime Minister John Curtin, who was part of the Australian Labor Party, reinforced the White Australia Policy and said the following in his defense: &quot;This country shall remain forever the home of the descendants of those people who came here in peace in order to establish in the South Seas an outpost of the British race.&quot; Arthur Calwell, another Old Leftist who led the Australian Labor Party in the 1960s, strongly defended the White Australia Policy and said the following: &quot;I am proud of my white skin, just as a Chinese is proud of his yellow skin, a Japanese of his brown skin, and the Indians of their various hues from black to coffee-coloured. Anybody who is not proud of his race is not a man at all. And any man who tries to stigmatize the Australian community as racist because they want to preserve this country for the white race is doing our nation great harm ... I reject, in conscience, the idea that Australia should or ever can become a multi-racial society and survive.&quot; Left-wing Labor members perceived unrestricted immigration as a ploy by owners to drive down wages, resulting in the leadership of labor unions often being skeptical of expanded immigration.

As late as 2015, Bernie Sanders criticized open borders a &quot;Koch brothers proposal&quot;, although he later switched to the more New Left position welcoming to immigration.

===Homosexuality===

Communist leaders and intellectuals took many different positions on LGBT rights issues. Marx and Engels wrote little on the subject; Marx in particular rarely commented on sexuality in general. Writing for Political Affairs, Norman Markowitz writes: &quot;Here, to be frank, one finds from Marx a refusal to entertain the subject, and from Engels open hostility to the individuals involved&quot;. This is because in private Engels criticized male homosexuality and related it to ancient Greek pederasty, saying that &quot;[the ancient Greeks] fell into the abominable practice of sodomy [, meaning &#x27;boy love&quot; or pederasty] and degraded alike their gods and themselves with the myth of Ganymede&quot;. Engels also said that the pro-pederast movement &quot;cannot fail to triumph. [war on the cunts, peace to the arse-holes] will now be the slogan&quot;. Engels also referred to Dr. Karl Boruttau as a (&quot;gay prick&quot;) in private.

In fact, in the Soviet Union, male homosexuality was considered a crime after its re-criminalization during the Stalinist era (it had previously been decriminalised by the early soviet government), a law which would not be revoked until 1993 after the dissolution of the USSR.

The &quot;Encyclopedia of Homosexuality&quot; is unequivocal on Marx and Engels view of homosexuality, stating in volume 2: &quot;There can be little doubt that, as far as they thought of the matter at all, Marx and Engels were personally homo-phobic, as shown by an acerbic 1869 exchange of letter on Jean-Baptiste von Schweitzer, a German socialist rival. Schweitzer had been arrested in a park on a morals charge and not only did Marx and Engels refuse to join a committee defending him, they resorted to the cheapest form of bathroom humor in their private comments about the affair&quot;.

In 1933, Joseph Stalin added Article 121 to the entire Soviet Union criminal code, which made male homosexuality a crime punishable by up to five years in prison with hard labor. The precise reason for Article 121 is in some dispute among historians. The few official government statements made about the law tended to confuse homosexuality with pedophilia and was tied up with a belief that homosexuality was only practiced among fascists or the aristocracy. The law remained intact until after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and was repealed in 1993. Gay men were sometimes denied membership or expelled from Communist parties across the globe during the 20th century as most Communist parties followed the social precedents set by the Soviet Union.

The Party of Socialists of the Republic of Moldova (PSRM) is a party which strongly opposes LGBT rights in Moldova and works with nationalist, right-wing and religious movements to counter the &quot;promotion of vice spread with the help of the US in Moldova&quot;; the Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova (PCRM) holds similar positions. The Communist Party of the Russian Federation (KPRF) supported an anti-gay law in 2013. The Communist Party of Greece (KKE) voted against the introduction of same-sex civil unions in 2015, but has also criticized homophobia and discrimination in general.

== Emergence of the New Left ==
The New Left arose first among dissenting intellectuals and campus groups in the United Kingdom and later alongside campuses in the United States and in the Western bloc.

The German critical theorist Herbert Marcuse is referred to as the &quot;Father of the New Left&quot;. Marcuse rejected the theory of class struggle and the Marxist concern with labor. According to Leszek Kołakowski, Marcuse argued that since &quot;all questions of material existence have been solved, moral commands and prohibitions are no longer relevant&quot;. He regarded the realization of man&#x27;s erotic nature as the true liberation of humanity, which inspired the utopias of Jerry Rubin and others.

Between 1943 and 1950, Marcuse worked in U.S. government service for the Office of Strategic Services (predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency) and criticized the ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the book &quot;Soviet Marxism: A Critical Analysis&quot; (1958). After his studies, in the 1960s and the 1970s he became known as the pre-eminent theorist of the New Left and the student movements of West Germany, France and the United States.

<text>Kempley is a village and civil parish in the Forest of Dean district of Gloucestershire, England, close to the border with Herefordshire. It lies northwest of Gloucester and of Hereford. The nearest market towns of Newent and Ledbury are and away respectively.

The village maintains the Kempley Tardis (a redundant telephone box) - a National Lottery funded project supported by English Heritage. The project, which is run by the Friends of Kempley Churches, aims to archive and document the entire social, economic and cultural history of the village.

In March 1994 fields near the village were found to contain the remains of two of the victims of serial killer Fred West. The small parish (280 residents) has two notable churches, one dedicated to St Mary and another to St Edward the Confessor.

==St Mary&#x27;s Church==
St Mary&#x27;s Church, Kempley has in its chancel &quot;the most complete set of Romanesque frescos in northern Europe&quot;, including the &quot;Christ in Majesty&quot; painting created in about 1120. On the walls of the nave are further images, including a wheel of life, showing the life cycle of man. These are worked in tempera painted on dry lime mortar, unlike those in the chancel which are true frescoes. St Mary&#x27;s Church is owned by English Heritage and maintained by The Friends of Kempley Churches.

The Church has the oldest roof of any building in Britain, dating from 1120-1150 and has an unusually well-preserved interior. In the early months of the year, from late February to early March, the churchyard is very beautiful, often being covered in wild daffodils.
==St Edward&#x27;s Church==
The Church of St Edward (1903), described by Betjeman as &quot;a mini-cathedral of the Arts and Crafts movement&quot;, was built from local materials by local labour, under the direction of Randall Wells, clerk of works at All Saints&#x27; Church, Brockhampton. The church was planned by the Lord of the Manor and major landowner, William Lygon, 7th Earl Beauchamp, because St Mary&#x27;s was too far away from the main centres of population in the parish at Kempley Green and Fishpool, and liable to flooding. The walls of the church are in Forest of Dean red sandstone.

<doc id="229227" wikidata="Q121734" url="?curid=229227" title="Thomas Picton">
<text>Lieutenant-General Sir Thomas Picton (24 August 175818 June 1815) was a British Army officer and colonial administrator who fought in the Napoleonic Wars. According to the historian Alessandro Barbero, Picton was &quot;respected for his courage and feared for his irascible temperament&quot;. The Duke of Wellington called him &quot;a rough foul-mouthed devil as ever lived&quot;, but found him capable.

Picton came to public attention initially for his cruelty during his governorship of Trinidad, as a result of which he was put on trial in England for approving the illegal picketing of a 14-year-old girl, Luisa Calderón. Though initially convicted, Picton later had the conviction overturned arguing that Trinidad was subject to Spanish law, which permitted the use of torture. Controversy over the torture and Picton&#x27;s role in the Atlantic slave trade revived in recent years. In 2020, Cardiff Council voted to remove Picton&#x27;s statue in the &quot;Heroes of Wales&quot; gallery in Cardiff City Hall. In the same year it was reported that a plaque was removed from Picton&#x27;s birthplace.
In 2022, the National Museum Cardiff relocated Picton&#x27;s portrait from its &quot;Faces of Wales&quot; gallery to a side room, accompanied by descriptions of his brutal treatment of the people of Trinidad. The town of Picton in New Zealand, named for Picton, has considered reverting to its Māori name in response to his actions as governor of Trinidad.

Picton was for many years chiefly remembered for his exploits under Wellington in the Iberian Peninsular War of 1807–1814, during which he displayed great bravery and persistence. He was killed in 1815 fighting at the Battle of Waterloo whilst commanding the 5th Infantry Division. During a crucial stage in the battle he was ordered by Wellington to intervene in the Allied centre, which was beginning to buckle under the weight of a heavy French assault. Picton led the 5th division in aggressive counter-advance which stopped d&#x27;Erlon&#x27;s corps&#x27; attack against the allied centre left. The manoeuvre however cost Picton his life when he was struck through the head by French shot. His body was carried from the field by soldiers of the 32nd Foot who Picton had personally led in a bayonet charge against the French line. He was the most senior officer to die at Waterloo. He was a sitting Member of Parliament at the time of his death.

==Early life==
Thomas Picton was the seventh of 12 children of Thomas Picton (1723–1790) of Poyston Hall, Pembrokeshire, Wales, and his wife, Cecil née Powell (1728–1806). He was born in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire on (probably) 24 August 1758. In 1771 he obtained an ensign&#x27;s commission in the 12th Regiment of Foot, but he did not join until two years later. The regiment was then stationed at Gibraltar, where he remained until he was made captain in the 75th Regiment of Foot (Prince of Wales&#x27;s Regiment) in January 1778, at which point he then returned to Britain.

The regiment was disbanded five years later, and Picton quelled a mutiny amongst the men by his prompt personal action and courage, and was promised the rank of major as a reward. He did not receive it, and after living in retirement on his father&#x27;s estate for nearly 12 years, he went out to the West Indies in 1794 on the strength of a slight acquaintance with Sir John Vaughan, the commander-in-chief, who made him his &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; and gave him a captaincy in the 17th Regiment of Foot. Shortly afterwards he was promoted major in the 58th Regiment of Foot.

==Career in the New World==
Under Sir Ralph Abercromby, who succeeded Vaughan in 1795, Picton was present at the capture of Saint Lucia (after which he was promoted to lieutenant colonel of the 56th Regiment of Foot) and then that of St Vincent.

After the reduction of Trinidad in 1797, Abercromby made Picton governor of the island. For the next five years he held the island with a garrison he considered inadequate against the threats of internal unrest and of reconquest by the Spanish. He ensured order by vigorous action, viewed variously as rough-and-ready justice or as arbitrary brutality. Picton was also accused of the execution of a dozen slaves, and the slave trade was partly behind his considerable fortune. Historian Chris Evans said, &quot;Delinquents who were sent for immediate execution might consider themselves lucky; others had to endure mutilation and torture.&quot;

In October 1801 he was gazetted to the local rank of brigadier-general. During the negotiations leading to the Peace of Amiens of 1802, many of the British inhabitants petitioned against the return of the island to Spain; this together with Picton&#x27;s and Abercromby&#x27;s representations, ensured the retention of Trinidad as a British possession.

By then, reports of arbitrariness and brutality associated with his governorship had led to a demand at home for his removal. Picton was also making money from speculation in land and slaves, and his free coloured mistress and mother of four of his children, Rosetta Smith, was believed to be corruptly influencing his decisions. Furthermore, Trinidad no longer faced any external threat, the Pitt ministry had fallen and the new Addington administration did not want Trinidad to develop the plantation economy Picton favoured. In 1802, William Fullarton (1754–1808) was appointed as the Senior Member of a commission to govern the island, Samuel Hood became the second member, and Picton himself the junior.

Fullarton had a very different background from Picton. He came from a wealthy and long-established Scots land-owning family and was a Whig MP, a Fellow of the Royal Society, an improving landlord, and a patron of Robert Burns. He had been a junior diplomat before raising a regiment in the course of the American War of Independence, of which he naturally became the Colonel. He ended that war in India, commanding an army of 14,000 men in operations against Tippu Sultan. Afterwards he had written an influential pamphlet arguing that the East India Company had brought trouble on itself by its unprincipled treatment of native princes and native subjects, and that a more humane policy would be preferable to &quot;let them hate so long as they fear&quot; (a favourite motto of Caligula).

Picton&#x27;s policy with respect to various sections of the island population had effectively been one of rule by fear, and he and Fullarton rapidly fell out. (This, of itself, further worsened the rift: Fullarton&#x27;s Indian pamphlet had also reported adversely on conflicts of interest and dissension between the English having weakened their ability to govern well, to negotiate effectively, and to effectively defend their possessions.) Fullarton commenced a series of open enquiries on allegations against Picton and reported his unfavourable views on Picton&#x27;s past actions at length to meetings of the commission. Picton thereupon tendered his resignation on 31 May 1803.

==Arrest and trials==
Picton joined Hood in military operations in Saint Lucia and Tobago, before returning to Britain to face charges brought by Fullarton. In December 1803 he was arrested by order of the Privy Council and promptly released on bail set at £40,000.

The Privy Council dealt with the majority of the charges against Picton. Those charges related principally to accusations of excessive cruelty in the detection and punishment of practitioners of Obeah, severity to slaves, and of execution of suspects out of hand without due process. Only the latter class of charge seems to have seriously worried the Privy Council, and here Picton&#x27;s argument that either the laws of Trinidad (then still the laws of the former Spanish colonial power: Abercromby had specifically instructed Picton to conduct himself according to those laws) or &quot;the state of the garrison&quot; (martial law) justified the immediate execution in the cases specified eventually carried the day.
Picton was, however, tried in the Court of King&#x27;s Bench before Lord Ellenborough in 1806 on a single charge: the misdemeanour of having in 1801 caused torture to be unlawfully inflicted to extract a confession from Luisa Calderón, a 14-year-old free mulatto girl suspected of assisting one of her lovers to burgle the house of the man with whom she was living, making off with about £500. Torture (but not the specific form) had been requested in writing by a local magistrate and approved in writing by Picton. The torture applied (&quot;picketing&quot;) was a version of a British military punishment and consisted in principle of compelling the trussed-up suspect to stand on one toe on a flat-headed peg for one hour on many occasions within a span of a few days. Calderón was subjected to one session of 55 minutes, and a second of 25 minutes the following day. The young girl was suspended by one arm on a pulley rope set in the ceiling and lowered onto a peg in the floor, bare foot first. This continued until her entire body weight rested on the peg. She did not confess and was imprisoned for a further eight months before being released.

The period between Picton&#x27;s return and the trial had seen a pamphlet war between the rival camps, and the widespread sale of engravings showing a curious British public what an attractive 14-year-old mulatto girl being trussed up and tortured in a state of semi-undress might look like. At the trial, Luisa Calderón gave evidence in person (&quot;Her appearance was extremely interesting, and her countenance, which was that of a mulatto, extremely prepossessing and agreeable&quot;) of the nature and duration of her picketing. The legal arguments, however, revolved on whether Spanish law permitted torture of suspects. On the evidence presented by the prosecution and with Picton&#x27;s defence being damaged by the cross-examination of his witnesses (&quot;Mr Bourville was examined relative to the nature of the office of &quot;alkald&quot;, or justice at Trinidad. On his cross examination by William Garrow, he said, the first introduction of torture was by General Picton.&quot; ... &quot;Mr Gloucester, the Attorney-General at Trinidad, verified several books as books of authority, in which it was expressly laid down, that by the Spanish law torture might be inflicted; these books were, the &quot;Borvillia&quot;, the &quot;Curia Phillipion&quot;, and the &quot;Elesando&quot;. On his cross-examination he admitted that the &quot;Caedula&quot; and &quot;Raecopilazione&quot; were also books of authority. They contained a code expressly applicable to the Spanish West India Islands, and there was not a word about torture in them&quot;); the jury decided that it did not and found Picton guilty.

Picton promptly sought a retrial, which he got in 1808. At this, Picton&#x27;s counsel stressed that the use of torture had been requested by the local magistrate, that there were copious authorities showing its legality under Spanish law, and that Calderón had been old enough to be legally tortured. Against the argument that torture was legal under the laws of Spain, but nowhere authorised by those of its colonies, he presented a considerable body of depositions from inhabitants of Trinidad showing that torture had frequently been resorted to by magistrates in the last years of Spanish occupation. The jury found that torture was authorised by the law of the island at the time of the cession, and that the defendant acted without malice, further than making an order which he thought himself bound to comply with. They therefore reversed the verdict of the earlier trial but asked for the full court to consider the further argument of the prosecution that torture of a free person was so repugnant to the laws of England that Picton must have known he could not permit it, whatever Spanish law authorised. The court ordered that Picton&#x27;s obligations to the court be postponed until the court could consider the matter further but no judgment was ever delivered.

Friends of Picton in the military and among slave owners subscribed towards his legal expenses. Picton contributed the same sum to a relief fund after a widespread fire in Port of Spain. He had meanwhile been promoted major-general, and in 1809 he had been governor of Flushing in the Netherlands during the Walcheren expedition.

==European military service==

In 1810, at Wellington&#x27;s request, Picton was appointed to command a division in Spain. Wellington recalled that he had been recommended by General Miranda, who considered him &quot;extremely clever&quot;, but also did not trust him, because &quot;he has so much vanity that if you sent him out to the Caraccas or the West India Islands, he would attempt to become the prince of them&quot;. Wellington commented when he met Picton,

For the remaining years of the Peninsular War, Picton was one of Wellington&#x27;s principal subordinates. The commander-in-chief never reposed in him the confidence that he gave to Beresford, Hill and Robert Craufurd but in the resolute, thorough and punctual execution of a well-defined task Picton had no superior in the army. His debut, owing partly to his naturally stern and now embittered temper, and partly to the difficult position in which he was placed, was unfortunate. On the River Coa in July 1810 Craufurd&#x27;s division became involved in an action, and Picton, his nearest neighbour, refused to support him, as Wellington&#x27;s direct orders were to avoid an engagement. Shortly after this, however, at Busaco, Picton succeeded in driving French forces across a ravine in considerable disorder.

After the winter in the lines of Torres Vedras, he added to his reputation and to that of his division, the &quot;Fighting&quot; 3rd, at the Battle of Fuentes de Onoro. In September he was given the local rank of lieutenant-general, and in the same month the division won great glory by its rapid and orderly retirement under severe pressure from the French cavalry at the engagement at El Bodon. In October Picton was appointed to the colonelcy of the 77th Regiment of Foot.
In the first operations of 1812 Picton and Craufurd, side by side, stormed the two breaches of Ciudad Rodrigo. Both Craufurd and Picton&#x27;s second in command, Major-General Henry MacKinnon, were mortally wounded in the engagement. At Badajoz, a month later, the successful storming of the fortress was due to his daring self-reliance and penetration in converting the secondary attack on the castle, delivered by the 3rd Division, into a real one. He was himself wounded in this terrible engagement, but would not leave the ramparts, and the day after, having recently inherited a fortune, he gave every survivor of his command a guinea. His wound, and an attack of fever, compelled him to return to Britain to recoup his health, but he reappeared at the front in April 1813. While in Britain he was invested with the collar and badge of a Knight of the Order of the Bath by the Prince Regent George, and in June he was made a lieutenant-general in the army. At this time, Picton purchased the Iscoed estate in Carmarthenshire, and was returned triumphantly as Member of Parliament for Pembroke Boroughs at a by-election on 19 March 1813.

At the Battle of Vitoria, Picton led his division across a key bridge under heavy fire. According to Picton, the enemy responded by pummeling the 3rd with 40 to 50 cannon and a counter-attack on their right flank (which was still open because they had captured the bridge so quickly) causing the 3rd to lose 1,800 men (over one third of all Allied losses at the battle) as they held their ground. The conduct of the 3rd division under his leadership at Vittoria and in the engagements in the Pyrenees raised his reputation as a resolute and skilful fighting general to a still higher point. Early in 1814 he was offered, but after consulting Wellington declined, the command of the British forces operating on the side of Catalonia.

On the break-up of the division the officers presented Picton with a valuable service of plate, and on 24 June 1814 he received for the seventh time the thanks of the House of Commons for his great services. Somewhat to his disappointment he was not included amongst the generals who were raised to the peerage, but early in 1815 he was appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB).

==Death==

When Napoleon returned from Elba, Picton, at Wellington&#x27;s request, accepted a high command in the Anglo-Dutch army, and was appointed commander of the 5th Infantry Division. Along with every other senior officer in the army, he was invited to the Duchess of Richmond&#x27;s Ball that was held on 15 June.

On 18 June, at Waterloo, when Napoleon sent in the Comte d&#x27;Erlon&#x27;s Corps to attack the Anglo-allied centre near La Haye Sainte at 13:30, Picton launched a bayonet charge on the advancing French column. While repulsing the attack with impetuous valour – his last words were &quot;Charge! Charge! Hurrah! Hurrah!&quot; – he was shot through the temple by a musket ball.

Announcing his death, Wellington wrote to the Minister of War, Lord Bathurst:

On subsequent examination, Picton&#x27;s body was found to have suffered a serious musket ball wound to the hip at Quatre Bras on the 16th. Apart from his servant, he had told no one, nor had he consulted a surgeon, choosing instead to bandage the wound himself.

His body arrived in Deal in Kent on 25June to a salute from the guns of the ships moored in The Downs. It reached Canterbury the same evening and was deposited in a room at the Fountain Inn where Picton had dined on his way to the Continent. At 6:00 am on 26June, to the strains of the &quot;Dead March&quot; in &quot;Saul&quot;, the funeral procession accompanied by the 52nd Regiment of Foot with reversed arms moved off towards London where it arrived on 3July.

==Burial and monuments==
He was interred in the family vault at St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square. A public monument was erected to his memory in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, by order of Parliament, and in 1823 another Picton Monument was erected at Carmarthen by subscription, the king contributing a hundred guineas. On 8 June 1859, his body was re-interred in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, lying close to the body of the Duke of Wellington.

He is memorialised in St Michael&#x27;s Church, Rudbaxton in Pembrokeshire, the parish in which he grew up. There is also a monument on the battlefield of Waterloo.

*In June 2020, in the wake of the George Floyd protests and the toppling of the statue of Edward Colston in Bristol, the Lord Mayor of Cardiff, Dan De&#x27;Ath, and the leader of Cardiff Council, Huw Thomas, supported calls to remove the City Hall statue on account of Picton&#x27;s links to slavery. In July, the Council voted to remove the statue.
*In November 2021 National Museum Cardiff removed his portrait which had been in the museum since 1907, due to his ties with slavery in Trinidad. In August 2022, the portrait, which had previously formed part of the &quot;Faces of Wales&quot; gallery, was put back on display in an exhibition called &quot;Reframing Picton&quot; and was surrounded by descriptions of his brutal treatment of the people of Trinidad.

<text>Bud Gaugh is an American drummer who is a member of the band Sublime, and previously played in Long Beach Dub Allstars (1997–2002), Eyes Adrift (2002–2003), Volcano (2004), and Sublime with Rome (2009–2011), as well as Phil &amp; the Blanx, Del Mar, and Jelly of the Month Club.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Gaugh was born in Hawaii but grew up in Long Beach, California.

Gaugh was childhood friends with Eric Wilson. Gaugh stated that Eric&#x27;s father, Bill, &quot;was like a second father to me, a total inspiration&quot;. Bill Wilson taught Gaugh how to play drums. Gaugh and Eric Wilson played together in garage punk bands, such as Juice Bros., throughout high school.

===1988–1996: Sublime===
Eric Wilson introduced Gaugh to Bradley Nowell, and the trio went on to form Sublime in 1988. Gaughs drumming is heard on all three of the bands studio albums: &quot;40oz. to Freedom&quot; (1992), &quot;Robbin&#x27; the Hood&quot; (1994), and &quot;Sublime&quot; (1996).

Around 1990, according to Marshall Goodman, Gaugh left Sublime and Goodman assumed sole drumming responsibilities. Gaugh was not the primary drummer on the &quot;40 oz. to Freedom&quot; record. When Gaugh rejoined, Sublime became a five-person collaboration between himself, Wilson, Nowell, Goodman, and Michael Happoldt. In 1996, Sublime disbanded due to the death of lead singer Bradley Nowell from a heroin overdose.

===1996–2009: Post-Sublime bands===
Gaugh was a founding member of the Long Beach Dub Allstars in 1997. Their first album, released in 1999, was called &quot;Right Back&quot;. They followed it with &quot;Wonders of the World&quot; in 2002. Long Beach Dub Allstars broke up in 2002, and Gaugh did not rejoin when the band reunited in 2012. Gaugh stated in an interview that he didn&#x27;t &quot;harbor any grudges towards any musicians in the band. It was more of outside influences that was a problem there.&quot;

Gaugh played drums in Eyes Adrift with Krist Novoselic and Curt Kirkwood. After Eyes Adrift disbanded, he went on to form Volcano with Kirkwood. Volcano released one self-titled album in 2004.

Gaugh formed the surf rock band Del Mar in 2006 with his wife Nicole Gaugh on guitar, alongside guitarist Matt Bode and bassist Mike Martinez. They released one album, &quot;After the Quake&quot; (2009).

===2009–2011: Sublime With Rome===

It was announced in early 2009 that Gaugh would be reuniting with Sublime at Cantina Los Tres Hombres in 
Sparks, Nevada, on February 28, with new frontman and guitarist Rome Ramirez in the place of Bradley Nowell. Following positive response, the band decided to reunite properly in August 2009 for a possible tour and new album. However, not long after the October 2009 performance at Cypress Hill&#x27;s Smokeout Festival, a Los Angeles judge banned the new lineup from using the Sublime name, and the band was forced to change its name. The new lineup of Eric Wilson, Bud Gaugh, and Rome Ramirez performed together as Sublime with Rome. A debut album, &quot;Yours Truly&quot;, was released on July 12, 2011.

Gaugh left Sublime with Rome on December 10, 2011 and was replaced by Josh Freese. On January 12, 2012, in an interview posted on budztv.com, Gaugh expressed regrets about touring and recording with Sublime with Rome, stating, &quot;In hindsight I would not have used the name. I didn&#x27;t want to in the first place, I was talked into it and I would like to apologize to certain people and the fans for trying to justify or talk them into it as well.&quot; When asked how it felt to play Sublime songs again, Gaugh said, &quot;It was really good for the first few months; after that, it just felt wrong. Not playing the songs but playing them with the name Sublime, without Brad.&quot; When asked if he saw the band reuniting in the future, Gaugh replied, &quot;No, I am done with SWR. I would be into playing music with Eric Wilson, however.&quot;

===2011–present: Later work and reformation of Sublime===
Gaugh joined Jelly of the Month Club, and featured on their debut album &quot;Introducing, Jelly of the Month Club&quot; (2013). He later joined The Yamarone Brothers, described as a &quot;Bigfoot rock band&quot;, and performed with the trio Phil and the Blanx.

In 2023, Gaugh rejoined Sublime with Jakob Nowell on vocals. They toured at Coachella and additional music festivals the following year.

<text>Johann Sebastian Bach composed  (Delightful rest, beloved pleasure of the soul), 170, a church cantata for the sixth Sunday after Trinity in Leipzig. It is a solo cantata for alto that he first performed on 28 July 1726.

== History and words ==

Bach composed the cantata in Leipzig for the Sixth Sunday after Trinity. The prescribed readings for the Sunday are from the Epistle to the Romans, &quot;By Christ&#x27;s death we are dead for sin&quot; (), and from the Gospel of Matthew a passage from the Sermon on the Mount about better justice than the justice of merely observing laws and rules (). The text of the cantata is drawn from Georg Christian Lehms&#x27; (1711) and speaks of the desire to lead a virtuous life and so enter heaven and avoid hell.

Bach first performed the cantata on 28 July 1726. Its brevity, compared to the cantatas in two parts written before and after, such as , can be explained assuming that in the same service another cantata &quot;Ich will meinen Geist in euch geben&quot;, JLB 7, by Johann Ludwig Bach was also performed. It is regarded as part of Bach&#x27;s third cantata cycle.

Bach performed it again around 1746. Bach&#x27;s son Wilhelm Friedemann Bach performed the first movement around 1752 in Halle.

== Scoring and structure ==

The cantata is one of three Bach cantatas written in Leipzig in the summer and fall of 1726, in which an alto soloist is the only singer, the others being , and . It seems likely that Bach had a capable alto singer at his disposal during this period.

Bach structured the cantata in five movements, alternating arias and recitatives. He scored the work for an alto soloist and a small ensemble of oboe d&#x27;amore (Oa), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), obbligato organ (Org) and basso continuo (BC). The duration of the cantata is given as 24 minutes.

In the following table of the movements, the scoring follows the Neue Bach-Ausgabe. The keys and time signatures are taken from Alfred Dürr, using the symbol for common time (4/4).



== Music ==

The first aria is a da capo aria in a pastoral rhythm. The musicologist Julian Mincham notes: &quot;The first stanza is enigmatically poetic and its essence is an evocation of that peace and inner contentment&quot;. The Bach scholar Alfred Dürr describes the mood as contemplative, and the melody of the voice as expansive, on a background of repeated quavers in the instruments.

The first recitative is secco, only accompanied by the continuo.

The second aria is set without continuo, rare in Bach&#x27;s compositions, and symbolic of the lack of direction in the lives of those who ignore the word of God, as spoken about in the text. The organ plays the upper parts, which the violins and viola in unison form the lowest part.

The second recitative is accompanied by the strings and continuo. The strings play mostly long chords but illustrate the words &quot; (to live with God, whose name is love) by more lively movement.

The final aria is a triumphant song of turning away from the world and desiring heaven. The words &quot; (I feel revulsion) are expressed by an unusual tritone opening the melody. The voice is ornamented by figuration in the organ, which Bach set for flauto traverso for a performance in his last years.

== Recordings ==

Notable singers in the alto range recorded the cantata, male (as in Bach&#x27;s time, also called altus or countertenor) and female (contralto or mezzo-soprano), including Alfred Deller, Maureen Forrester, René Jacobs, Julia Hamari, Aafje Heynis, Paul Esswood, Jochen Kowalski, Nathalie Stutzmann, Andreas Scholl, Michael Chance, Guillemette Laurens, Magdalena Kožená and Robin Blaze.

<text>A stepmother, stepmum or stepmom is a female non-biological parent married to one&#x27;s preexisting parent. Children from her spouse&#x27;s previous unions are known as her stepchildren. A stepmother-in-law is a stepmother of one&#x27;s spouse.

==Culture==
Stepparents (mainly stepmothers) may also face some societal challenges due to the stigma surrounding the &quot;evil stepmother&quot; character. Morello notes that the introduction of the &quot;evil stepmother&quot; character in the past is problematic to stepparents today, as it has created a stigma towards stepmothers. The presence of this stigma can have a negative impact on stepmothers&#x27; self-esteem.

==Fiction==
In fiction, stepmothers are often portrayed as being wicked and evil. The character of the wicked stepmother features heavily in fairy tales; the most famous examples are &quot;Cinderella&quot;, &quot;Snow White,&quot; and &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;. Stepdaughters are her most common victim, and then stepdaughter/stepson pairs, but stepsons also are victims as in &quot;The Juniper Tree&quot;—sometimes, as in &quot;East of the Sun and West of the Moon&quot;, because he refused to marry his stepsister as she wished, or, indeed, they may make their stepdaughters-in-law their victims, as in &quot;The Boys with the Golden Stars&quot;. In some fairy tales, such as Giambattista Basile&#x27;s &quot;La Gatta Cennerentola&quot; or the Danish &quot;Green Knight&quot;, the stepmother wins the marriage by ingratiating herself with the stepdaughter, and once she obtains it, becomes cruel.

In some fairy tales, the stepdaughter&#x27;s escape by marrying does not free her from her stepmother. After the birth of the stepdaughter&#x27;s first child, the stepmother may attempt to murder the new mother and replace her with her own daughter—thus making her the stepmother to the next generation. Such a replacement occurs in &quot;The Wonderful Birch&quot;, &quot;Brother and Sister&quot;, and &quot;The Three Little Men in the Wood&quot;; only by foiling the stepmother&#x27;s plot (and usually executing her), is the story brought to a happy ending. In the Korean Folktale &quot;Janghwa Hongryeon jeon&quot;, the stepmother kills her own stepdaughters.
In many stories with evil stepmothers, the hostility between the stepmother and the stepchild is underscored by having the child succeed through aid from the dead mother. This motif occurs from Norse mythology, where Svipdagr rouses his mother Gróa from the grave so as to learn from her how to accomplish a task his stepmother set, to fairy tales such as the Brothers Grimm version of &quot;Cinderella&quot;, where Aschenputtel receives her clothing from a tree growing on her mother&#x27;s grave, the Russian &quot;Vasilissa the Beautiful&quot;, where Vasilissa is aided by a doll her mother gave, and her mother&#x27;s blessing, and the Malay &quot;Bawang Putih Bawang Merah&quot;, where the heroine&#x27;s mother comes back as fish to protect her.
The notion of the word &quot;stepmother&quot; being descriptive of an intrinsically unkind parent is suggested by peculiar wording in John Gamble&#x27;s &quot;An Irish Wake&quot; (1826). He writes of a woman soon to die, who instructs her successor to &quot;be kind to my children.&quot; Gamble writes that the injunction was forgotten and that she &quot;proved a very step-mother.&quot;

Fairy tales can have variants where one tale has an evil mother and the other an evil stepmother: in &quot;The Six Swans&quot; by the Brothers Grimm and also in &quot;The Wild Swans&quot; by Hans Christian Andersen, the heroine is persecuted by her husband&#x27;s mother and in another one by her stepmother, and in &quot;The Twelve Wild Ducks&quot;, by his stepmother. Sometimes this appears to be a deliberate switch: The Brothers Grimm, having put in their first editions versions of &quot;Snow White&quot; and &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot; where the villain was the biological mother, altered it to a stepmother in later editions, perhaps to mitigate the story&#x27;s violence. Another reason for the change from a villainous mother to a villainous stepmother may have been the belief that mothers were sacred, as well as the belief that people would not believe that a mother could harbor such ill-will and animosity toward their child. The Icelandic fairy tale &quot;The Horse Gullfaxi and the Sword Gunnfoder&quot; features a good stepmother, who indeed aids the prince like a fairy godmother, but this figure is very rare in fairy tales.

The stepmother may be identified with other evils the characters meet. For instance, both the stepmother and the witch in &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot; are deeply concerned with food, the stepmother to avoid hunger, the witch with her house built of food and her desire to eat the children, and when the children kill the witch and return home, their stepmother has mysteriously died.

This hostility from the stepmother and tenderness from the true mother has been interpreted in varying ways. A psychological interpretation, by Bruno Bettelheim, describes it as &quot;splitting&quot; the actual mother in an ideal mother and a false mother that contains what the child dislikes in the actual mother. However, historically, many women died in childbirth, their husbands remarried, and the new stepmothers competed with the children of the first marriage for resources; the tales can be interpreted as factual conflicts from history. In some fairy tales, such as &quot;The Juniper Tree&quot;, the stepmother&#x27;s hostility is overtly the desire to secure the inheritance of her children.

Stepmothers also make many appearances in Chinese tales of family. Wicked stepmothers are common. In &quot;Classic of Filial Piety&quot;, Guo Jujing told the story of Min Ziqian, who had lost his mother at a young age. His stepmother had two more sons and saw to it that they were warmly dressed in winter but neglected her stepson. When her husband discovered this, he decided to divorce her. His son interceded, on the ground that she neglected only him, but when they had no mother, all three sons would be neglected. His father relented, and the stepmother henceforth took care of all three children. For this, he was held up as a model of filial piety.

Conversely, the exemplary stepmother prefers the stepson to her own child, in recognition that his seniority makes him superior. The &quot;righteous stepmother of Qi&quot;, faced with her son and stepson having been found by a murdered man, and both having confessed to shield the other, argues for her son&#x27;s execution because her husband had ordered her to look after her stepson, and her son is the junior brother; the king pardoned them both for her devotion to duty.

The ubiquity of the wicked stepmother has made it a frequent theme of revisionist fairy tale fantasy. This can range from Tanith Lee&#x27;s &quot;Red as Blood&quot;, where the stepmother queen is desperately trying to protect the land from her evil stepdaughter&#x27;s magic, to Diana Wynne Jones&#x27;s &quot;Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle&quot;, where, although it is known that stepmothers are evil, the actual stepmother is guilty of nothing more than some carelessness, to Erma Bombeck&#x27;s retelling where Cinderella is lazy and a liar. More subtly, Piers Anthony depicted the Princess Threnody as being cursed by her stepmother in &quot;Crewel Lye: A Caustic Yarn&quot;: if she ever entered Castle Roogna, it would fall down. But Threnody explains that her presence at the castle caused her father to dote on her and neglect his duties to the destruction of the kingdom; her stepmother had merely made her destructive potential literal, and forced her to confront what she was doing.

The character of the evil stepmother can also be found in the genre of young adult fiction or young adult social problem novels. In Lisa Heathfield&#x27;s Paper Butterflies. the protagonist June suffers horrific abuse at the hands of her stepmother, a fact that she conceals from her father.

Despite many examples of evil or cruel stepmothers, loving stepmothers also exist in fiction. In Kevin and Kell, Kell is portrayed as loving her stepdaughter Lindesfarne, whom her husband Kevin had adopted during his previous marriage. Likewise, Lindesfarne considers Kell her mother, and has a considerably more favorable view of her than Angelique, Kevin&#x27;s ex-wife and her adoptive mother, due to feeling neglected by Angelique during her childhood. The Disney film &quot;Enchanted&quot; also makes references to the &quot;evil stepmother&quot; belief, as the villainess is a stepmother, but her wickedness comes from her selfishness and power hungriness rather than the simple fact she is a stepmother. When a little girl tells the heroine Giselle that all stepmothers are evil, Giselle reminds her that she personally knows some wonderful women who were good stepmothers, and the fact a woman is a stepmother does not suddenly change her personality. This is shown later on when Giselle marries that girl&#x27;s father, who had her from a previous marriage, thus becoming a stepmother herself. As Giselle is a sweet and caring woman, she makes a good wife and stepmother. However, it is notable that during much of that film, Giselle was more of an older sister figure than a maternal figure to that little girl.

In the movie &quot;Nanny McPhee&quot; a group of children worry that their father will remarry, believing from their fairy tales that all stepmothers are an &quot;evil breed.&quot; Although they help their father marry again to help keep the family together, their soon-to-be stepmother is very cruel, as they suspected. When the wedding to her is called off, the father decides to marry the much kinder scullery maid, causing one child to comment that the evil stepmother personification does not apply to her.

Stepmother relationships are often examined in soap operas. An example of this is the long-running rivalry between Victoria Lord Banks and stepmother Dorian Lord on the American soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot;.

In contrast to many other Disney-related media, the animated series &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; features a stepfamily in which both parents get along well with their three children (avoiding the normal tropes of evil stepparents).

<text>The Frankfurt School is a school of thought in sociology and critical philosophy. It is associated with the Institute for Social Research founded at Goethe University Frankfurt in 1923. Formed during the Weimar Republic during the European interwar period, the first generation of the Frankfurt School was composed of intellectuals, academics, and political dissidents dissatisfied with the socio-economic systems of the 1930s: namely, capitalism, fascism, and communism. Significant figures associated with the school include Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Wilhelm Reich, Herbert Marcuse, and Jürgen Habermas.

The Frankfurt theorists proposed that existing social theory was unable to explain the turbulent political factionalism and reactionary politics, such as Nazism, of 20th-century liberal capitalist societies. Also critical of Marxism–Leninism as a philosophically inflexible system of social organization, the School&#x27;s critical-theory research sought alternative paths to social development.

What unites the disparate members of the School is a shared commitment to the project of human emancipation, theoretically pursued by an attempted synthesis of the Marxist tradition, psychoanalysis, and empirical sociological research.

==History==
===Institute for Social Research===

The term &quot;Frankfurt School&quot; describes the works of scholarship and the intellectuals who were the Institute for Social Research, an adjunct organization at Goethe University Frankfurt, founded in 1923, by Carl Grünberg, a Marxist professor of law at the University of Vienna. It was the first Marxist research center at a German university and was funded through the largess of the wealthy student Felix Weil (1898–1975).

Weil&#x27;s doctoral dissertation dealt with the practical problems of implementing socialism. In 1922, he organized the First Marxist Workweek in effort to synthesize different trends of Marxism into a coherent, practical philosophy; the first symposium included György Lukács, Karl Korsch, Karl August Wittfogel, and Friedrich Pollock. The success of the First Marxist Workweek prompted the formal establishment of a permanent institute for social research, and Weil negotiated with the Ministry of Education for a university professor to be director of the Institute for Social Research, thereby, formally ensuring that the Frankfurt School would be a university institution. Korsch and Lukács participated in the Workweek, which included the study of &quot;Marxism and Philosophy&quot; (1923), by Karl Korsch. Their Communist Party membership precluded their active participation in the Institute for Social Research; nevertheless, Korsch participated in the School&#x27;s publishing venture.

The philosophical tradition of the Frankfurt School – the multi-disciplinary integration of the social sciences – is associated with the philosopher Max Horkheimer, who became the director in 1930, and recruited intellectuals such as Theodor W. Adorno (philosopher, sociologist, musicologist), Erich Fromm (psychoanalyst), and Herbert Marcuse (philosopher).

===European interwar period (1918–39)===
In the Weimar Republic (1918–33), the continual political turmoils of the interwar years (1918–39) much affected the development of the critical theory philosophy of the Frankfurt School. The scholars were especially influenced by the Communists&#x27; failed German Revolution of 1918–19 and by the rise of Nazism (1933–45), a German form of fascism. To explain such reactionary politics, the Frankfurt scholars applied critical selections of Marxist philosophy to interpret, illuminate, and explain the origins and causes of reactionary socioeconomics in 20th-century Europe (a type of political economy unknown to Marx in the 19th century). The School&#x27;s further intellectual development derived from the publication, in the 1930s, of the &quot;Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844&quot; (1932) and &quot;The German Ideology&quot; (1932), which were interpreted as showing a continuity between Hegelianism and Marxist philosophy.

As the anti-intellectual threat of Nazism increased to political violence, the founders decided to move the Institute for Social Research out of Nazi Germany (1933–45). Soon after Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power in 1933, the Institute first moved from Frankfurt to Geneva, and then to New York City, in 1935, where it joined Columbia University. The School&#x27;s journal, the &quot;Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung&quot; (&quot;Journal of Social Research&quot;), was renamed &quot;Studies in Philosophy and Social Science&quot;. This began the period of the School&#x27;s important work in Marxist critical theory. By the 1950s, the paths of scholarship led Horkheimer, Adorno, and Pollock to return to West Germany, while Marcuse, Löwenthal, and Kirchheimer remained in the U.S. In 1953, the Institute for Social Research (Frankfurt School) was formally re-established in Frankfurt, West Germany.

==Critical theory==
The works of the Frankfurt School are to be understood in the context of the intellectual and practical objectives of critical theory. In &quot;Traditional and Critical Theory&quot; (1937), Max Horkheimer defined critical theory as social critique meant to effect sociologic change and realize intellectual emancipation, by way of enlightenment that is not dogmatic in its assumptions. Critical theory analyzes the true significance of &quot;the ruling understandings&quot; (the dominant ideology) generated in bourgeois society in order to show that the dominant ideology misrepresents &quot;how&quot; human relations occur in the real world and how capitalism justifies and legitimates the domination of people.

According to the theory of cultural hegemony, the dominant ideology is a ruling-class narrative that provides an explanatory justification of the current power-structure of society. Nonetheless, the story told through &quot;the ruling understandings&quot; conceals as much as it reveals about society. The task of the Frankfurt School was sociological analysis and interpretation of the areas of social-relation that Marx did not discuss in the 19th century – especially the base and superstructure aspects of a capitalist society.

Horkheimer opposed critical theory to &quot;traditional theory&quot;, wherein the word &quot;theory&quot; is applied in the positivistic sense of scientism, in the sense of a purely observational mode, which finds and establishes scientific law (generalizations) about the real world. Social sciences differ from natural sciences because their scientific generalizations cannot be readily derived from experience. The researcher&#x27;s understanding of a social experience is always filtered through biases in the researcher&#x27;s mind. What the researcher does not understand is that he or she operates within an historical and ideological context. The results for the theory being tested would conform to the ideas of the researcher rather than the facts of the experience proper; in &quot;Traditional and Critical Theory&quot; (1937), Horkheimer said:

For Horkheimer, the methods of investigation applicable to the social sciences cannot imitate the scientific method applicable to the natural sciences. In that vein, the theoretical approaches of positivism and pragmatism, of neo-Kantianism and phenomenology failed to surpass the ideological constraints that restricted their application to social science, because of the inherent logico–mathematic prejudice that separates theory from actual life, i.e. such methods of investigation seek a logic that is always true, and independent of and without consideration for continuing human activity in the field under study. He felt that the appropriate response to such a dilemma was the development of a critical theory of Marxism.

Horkheimer believed the problem was epistemological saying &quot;we should reconsider not merely the scientist, but the knowing individual, in general.&quot; Unlike orthodox Marxism, which applies a template to critique and to action, critical theory is self-critical, with no claim to the universality of absolute truth. As such, it does not grant primacy to matter (materialism) or consciousness (idealism), because each epistemology distorts the reality under study to the benefit of a small group. In practice, critical theory is outside the philosophical strictures of traditional theory; however, as a way of thinking and of recovering humanity&#x27;s self-knowledge, critical theory draws investigational resources and methods from Marxism.

===Dialectical method===
In contrast to modes of reasoning that view things in abstraction, each by itself and as though endowed with fixed properties, Hegel&#x27;s &quot;dialectical&quot; innovation was to consider reality according to its movement and change in time, according to interrelations and interactions of its various components or &quot;moments&quot;. The Frankfurt School attempted to reformulate Hegel&#x27;s idealistic dialectics into a more concrete method of investigation.

According to Hegel, human history can be reconstructed to show how what is rational in reality is the result of the overcoming of past contradictions. It is an intelligible process of human activity, the , which is the idea of progress towards a specific human condition; namely, the actualization of human freedom. However, the problem of future contingents (considerations about the future) did not interest Hegel, for whom philosophy cannot be prescriptive and normative, because philosophy comprehends only in hindsight. The study of history is limited to descriptions of past and present human realities. For Hegel and his successors (the right Hegelians), philosophy can only describe what is rational in the reality of the present, which in Hegel&#x27;s time was Christianity and the Prussian state.

Karl Marx and the young Hegelians strongly criticized that perspective. According to them, Hegel had over-reached in his abstract conception of &quot;absolute reason&quot; and had failed to notice the &quot;real&quot;— that is, and – life conditions of the proletariat. Marx claims to invert Hegel&#x27;s idealist dialectics in his own theory of dialectical materialism, arguing that &quot;it is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but that their social being that determines their consciousness.&quot; Marx&#x27;s theory follows a materialist conception of history and geographic space, where the development of the productive forces is the primary motive force for historical change. The social and material contradictions inherent to capitalism must lead to its negation, which according to this theory, will be the replacement of capitalism with communism, a new, rational form of society.

Marx used dialectical analysis to uncover the contradictions in the predominant ideas of society, and in the social relations to which they are linked – exposing the underlying struggle between opposing forces. Only by becoming aware of the dialectic (i.e., attaining class consciousness) of such opposing forces in a struggle for power can men and women intellectually liberate themselves, and change the existing social order through social progress. The Frankfurt School understood that a dialectical method could only be adopted ; if they adopted a self-correcting method – a dialectical method that would enable the correction of previous, false interpretations of the dialectical investigation. Accordingly, critical theory rejected the historicism and materialism of orthodox Marxism.

===Critique of capitalist ideology===
====&quot;Dialectic of Enlightenment&quot;====
Adorno and Horkheimer&#x27;s &quot;Dialectic of Enlightenment&quot;, written during the Institute&#x27;s exile in America, was published in 1944. While retaining many Marxist insights, this work shifted emphasis from a critique of the material forces of production to a critique of the social and ideological forces bought about by early capitalism. The &quot;Dialectic of Enlightenment&quot; uses the &quot;Odyssey&quot; as a paradigm for their analysis of bourgeois consciousness. In this work, Adorno and Horkheimer introduce many themes that central to subsequent social thought. Their exposition of the domination of nature as a central characteristic of instrumental rationality and its application within the capitalism of the post-Enlightenment era was made long before ecology and environmentalism became popular concerns.

They claim that Instrumental rationality is the new means of cultural reproduction within the mechanical age. It is a fusion of domination and technological rationality that brings all of external and internal nature under the power of the human subject. In the process the subject gets swallowed up and no social force analogous to the proletariat can be identified that could enable the subject to emancipate itself.

It is their contention that, at a time when it appears that reality itself has become the basis for ideology, the greatest contribution that critical theory can make is to explore the dialectical contradictions of individual subjective experience, on the one hand, and to preserve the truth of theory, on the other. Even dialectical progress is put into doubt: &quot;Its truth or untruth is not inherent in the method itself, but in its intention in the historical process.&quot; This intention must be oriented toward integral freedom and happiness: &quot;The only philosophy which can be responsibly practiced in face of despair is the attempt to contemplate all things as they would present themselves from the standpoint of redemption.&quot;

From a sociological point of view, Adorno and Horkheimer&#x27;s works demonstrate an ambivalence concerning the ultimate source of social domination, an ambivalence that gave rise to the &quot;pessimism&quot; of critical theory about the possibility of human emancipation and freedom. This ambivalence was rooted in the historical circumstances in which the work was originally produced, in particular, the rise of Nazism, state capitalism, and mass culture as entirely new forms of social domination that could not be adequately explained within the terms of traditional Marxist sociology. For Adorno and Horkheimer, state intervention in the economy had effectively abolished the tension in capitalism between the &quot;relations of production&quot; and &quot;material productive forces of society&quot;—a tension that, according to traditional Marxist theory, constituted the primary contradiction within capitalism. The previously &quot;free&quot; market (as an &quot;unconscious&quot; mechanism for the distribution of goods) and &quot;irrevocable&quot; private property of Marx&#x27;s epoch gradually had been replaced by the more central role of management hierarchies at the firm level and macroeconomic interventions at the state level in contemporary Western societies. The dialectic through which Marx predicted the emancipation of modern society was suppressed, effectively subjugated to a positivist rationality of domination.

Philosopher and critical theorist Nikolas Kompridis writes:
Kompridis argues that this &quot;sceptical cul-de-sac&quot; was arrived at with &quot;a lot of help from the once unspeakable and unprecedented barbarity of European fascism&quot; and could not be gotten out of without &quot;some well-marked [exit or] , showing the way out of the ever-recurring nightmare in which Enlightenment hopes and Holocaust horrors are fatally entangled.&quot; However, , according to Kompridis, this would not come until later – purportedly in the form of Jürgen Habermas&#x27;s work on the intersubjective bases of communicative rationality.

In psychoanalytic terms, consumption culture and mass media displaced the role of a father figure in the paternalistic family. Rather than serving to liberate society from patriarchal authority however, this merely replaced it with the authority of the &quot;totally administered&quot; society. Christopher Lasch criticized subsequent liberatory movements of the 1960s for failing to reckon with this dynamic, which in his view led to a &quot;culture of narcissism&quot;. Lasch believed the &quot;later Frankfurt School&quot; tended to ground political criticisms too much on psychiatric diagnoses like the authoritarian personality: &quot;This procedure excused them from the difficult work of judgment and argumentation. Instead of arguing with opponents, they simply dismissed them on psychiatric grounds.&quot;

====Art and music criticism====
Walter Benjamin&#x27;s essay &quot;The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction&quot; is a canonical text in art history and film studies. Benjamin is optimistic about the potential of commodified works of art to introduce radical political views to the proletariat. In contrast, Adorno and Horkheimer saw the rise of the culture industry as promoting homogeneity of thought and entrenching existing authorities. For instance, Adorno (a trained classical pianist) polemicized against popular music because it had become part of the culture industry of advanced capitalist society and the false consciousness that contributes to social domination. He argued that radical art and music may preserve the truth by capturing the reality of human suffering. Hence, &quot;What radical music perceives is the untransfigured suffering of man... The seismographic registration of traumatic shock becomes, at the same time, the technical structural law of music&quot;.

This view of modern art as producing truth only through the negation of traditional aesthetic form and traditional norms of beauty because they have become ideological is characteristic of Adorno and of the Frankfurt School generally. It has been criticized by those who do not share its conception of modern society as a false totality that renders obsolete traditional conceptions and images of beauty and harmony. In particular, Adorno criticized jazz and popular music, viewing them as part of the culture industry that contributes to the present sustainability of capitalism by rendering it &quot;aesthetically pleasing&quot; and &quot;agreeable&quot;. Martin Jay has called the attack on jazz the least successful aspect of Adorno&#x27;s work in America.

==Praxis==
Members of the Frankfurt School were academics and generally avoided (direct) political action or praxis. Max Horkheimer opposed any revolutionary rhetoric in the institute&#x27;s publications, since it could jeopardize funding from the West German government. Theodor Adorno showed some sympathy to student movements, particularly after the killing of Benno Ohnesorg, but he did not believe street violence had the potential to effect change. Angela Davis, a student of Marcuse, recounted advice given to her by Adorno that critical theorists working in the radical movements of the 1960s were, &quot;akin to a media studies scholar deciding to become a radio technician&quot;.

In &quot;The Theory of the Novel&quot; (1971), György Lukács criticized the &quot;leading German intelligentsia&quot;, including some members of the Frankfurt School (Adorno is named explicitly), as inhabiting the &quot;Grand Hotel Abyss&quot;, a metaphorical place from which the theorists comfortably analyze the &quot;abyss&quot;, the world beyond. Lukács described this contradictory situation as follows: They inhabit &quot;a beautiful hotel, equipped with every comfort, on the edge of an abyss, of nothingness, of absurdity. And the daily contemplation of the abyss, between excellent meals or artistic entertainments, can only heighten the enjoyment of the subtle comforts offered.&quot;

The singular exception to this was Herbert Marcuse, who engaged with the new left in the 1960s and 1970s. Marcuse&#x27;s &quot;One-Dimensional Man&quot; described the containment of the working class by material consumption and mass media that diverted any possibility of a proletarian revolution. Although Marcuse considered this pessimistic state of affairs to be &quot;fait accompli&quot; when the book was published in 1964, he was surprised and pleased when almost immediately the civil rights movement intensified and serious opposition to the Vietnam war began. Student activists such as the Students for a Democratic Society in turn took an interest in Marcuse and his works. Formerly an obscure academic &quot;émigré&quot;, he rapidly became a controversial public intellectual known as the &quot;Guru of the New Left&quot;. Marcuse did not aim for narrow, incremental reforms but for the &quot;Great Refusal&quot; of all existing culture and &quot;total revolution&quot; against capitalism. In the democratic protests movements, Marcuse saw agents of change that could supplement the quiescent working class and unite with third-world communist revolutionaries. Marcuse took an active role in the New Left, organizing events with students in the United States and the West German student movement. 

Marcuse&#x27;s relationship with Horkheimer and Adorno was strained by their divergence of opinion about the student movements. The Socialist German Students&#x27; Union was harshly critical of Adorno for his lack of political engagement and would disrupt his lectures. When a student&#x27;s room was trashed for refusing to take part in protests, Adorno wrote, &quot;praxis serves as an ideological pretext for exercising moral constraint.&quot; Adorno further said it was a manifestation of the authoritarian personality. Adorno&#x27;s student Hans-Jürgen Krahl was also critical of Adorno&#x27;s inaction. When in January 1969, Krahl led a group of students to occupy a room, Adorno called the police to remove them, further angering the students. Marcuse criticized Adorno&#x27;s decision to call the police, writing &quot;I reject the unmediated translation of theory into praxis just as emphatically as you do. But I do believe that there are situations, moments, in which theory is pushed on further by praxis — situations and moments in which theory that is kept separate from praxis becomes untrue to itself&quot;.

In the 1970s, perceiving the limitations of the new left, Marcuse de-emphasized the third world and revolutionary violence in favor of a focus on social issues in the United States. He sought to recruit other movements on the political periphery, such as environmentalism and feminism, to a popular front for socialism. During this period, he spoke enthusiastically about women&#x27;s liberation, seeing in it echoes of his earlier work in &quot;Eros and Civilization&quot;. Seeing that the revolutionary moment of the 1960s was over, Marcuse advised students to avoid even a suggestion of violence. Instead, he advocated the &quot;long march through the institutions&quot; and recommended educational institutions as a refuge for radicals in the U.S.

== Criticism ==
=== Psychoanalytic categorization ===
The historian Christopher Lasch criticized the Frankfurt School for their initial tendency of &quot;automatically&quot; rejecting opposing political criticisms, based upon &quot;psychiatric&quot; grounds:
=== Economics and communications media ===
During the 1980s, anti-authoritarian socialists in the United Kingdom and New Zealand criticized the rigid and deterministic view of popular culture deployed within the Frankfurt School theories of capitalist culture, which seemed to preclude any prefigurative role for social critique within such work. They argued that EC Comics often did contain such cultural critiques. Recent criticism of the Frankfurt School by the libertarian Cato Institute focused on the claim that culture has grown more sophisticated and diverse as a consequence of free markets and the availability of niche cultural text for niche audiences.

<text>Vuk Stefanović Karadžić (, ; 6 November 1787 (26 October OS)7 February 1864) was a Serbian philologist, anthropologist and linguist. He was one of the most important reformers of the modern Serbian language. For his collection and preservation of Serbian folktales, &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; labelled Karadžić &quot;the father of Serbian folk-literature scholarship.&quot; He was also the author of the first Serbian dictionary in the new reformed language. In addition, he translated the New Testament into the reformed form of the Serbian spelling and language.

He was well known abroad and familiar to Jacob Grimm, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and historian Leopold von Ranke. Karadžić was the primary source for Ranke&#x27;s &quot;Die serbische Revolution&quot; (&quot;The Serbian Revolution&quot;), written in 1829.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Karadžić was born to Serbian parents Stefan and Jegda (née &quot;Zrnić&quot;) in the village of Tršić, near Loznica, which was at the time in the Ottoman Empire. His family settled from Drobnjaci (Petnjica, Šavnik), and his mother was born in Ozrinići, Nikšić (in present-day Montenegro.) His family had a low infant survival rate, thus he was named Vuk (&quot;wolf&quot;) so that witches and evil spirits would not hurt him (the name was traditionally given to strengthen the bearer).

===Education===

Karadžić was fortunate to be a relative of Jevta Savić Čotrić, the only literate person in the area at the time, who taught him how to read and write. Karadžić continued his education in the Tronoša Monastery in Loznica. As a boy he learned calligraphy there, using a reed instead of a pen and a solution of gunpowder for ink. In lieu of proper writing paper, he was lucky if he could get cartridge wrappings. Throughout the whole region, regular schooling was not widespread at that time and his father at first did not allow him to go to Austria. Since most of the time, while in the monastery Karadžić was forced to pasture the livestock instead of studying, his father brought him back home. Meanwhile, the First Serbian uprising seeking to overthrow the Ottomans began in 1804. After unsuccessful attempts to enroll in the gymnasium at Sremski Karlovci, for which 19-year-old Karadžić was too old, he left for Petrinja where he spent a few months learning Latin and German. Later on, he met highly respected scholar Dositej Obradović in Belgrade, which was now in the hands of the Revolutionary Serbia, to ask Obradović to support his studies. Obradović dismissed him. Disappointed, Karadžić left for Jadar and began working as a scribe for Jakov Nenadović and sometime later for Jevta Savić Čotrić as a customs officer all during the time of the War of Independence (1804-1813). After the founding of Belgrade&#x27;s Grande école (University of Belgrade), Karadžić became one of its students.

===Later life and death===
Soon afterwards, he grew ill and left for medical treatment in Pest and Novi Sad, but was unable to receive treatment for his leg. It was rumored that Karadžić deliberately refused to undergo amputation, instead deciding to make do with a prosthetic wooden pegleg, of which there were several sarcastic references in some of his works. Karadžić returned to Serbia by 1810, and as unfit for military service, he served as the secretary for commanders Ćurčija and Hajduk-Veljko. His experiences would later give rise to two books. With the Ottoman defeat of the Serbian rebels in 1813, he left for Vienna and later met Jernej Kopitar, an experienced linguist with a strong interest in secular Slavistics. Kopitar&#x27;s influence helped Karadžić with his struggle in reforming the Serbian language and its orthography Another important influence on his linguistic work was Sava Mrkalj.

In 1814 and 1815, Karadžić published two volumes of &quot;Serbian Folk Songs&quot;, which afterwards increased to four, then to six, and finally to nine tomes. In enlarged editions, these admirable songs drew towards themselves the attention of all literary Europe and America. Goethe characterized some of them as &quot;excellent and worthy of comparison with Solomon&#x27;s &quot;Song of Songs&quot;.&quot;

In 1824, he sent a copy of his folksong collection to Jacob Grimm, who was enthralled particularly by The Building of Skadar which Karadžić recorded from singing of Old Rashko. Grimm translated it into German and the song was noted and admired for many generations to come. Grimm compared them with the noblest flowers of Homeric poetry, and of &quot;The Building of Skadar&quot; he said: &quot;one of the most touching poems of all nations and all times.&quot; The founders of the Romantic School in France, Charles Nodier, Prosper Mérimée, Lamartine, Gerard de Nerval, and Claude Fauriel translated a goodly number of them, and they also attracted the attention of Russian Alexander Pushkin, Finnish national poet Johan Ludwig Runeberg, Czech Samuel Roznay, Pole Kazimierz Brodzinski, English writers Walter Scott, Owen Meredith, and John Bowring, among others.

Karadžić continued collecting song well into the 1830s. He arrived in Montenegro in the fall of 1834. Infirm, he descended to the Bay of Kotor to winter there, and returned in the spring of 1835. It was there that Karadžić met Vuk Vrčević, an aspiring littérateur, born in Risan. From then on, Vrčević became Karadžić&#x27;s faithful and loyal collaborator who collected folk songs and tales and sent them to his address in Vienna for many years to come. Another equally diligent collaborator of Vuk Karadžić was another namesake from Boka Kotorska the Priest Vuk Popović. Both Vrčević and Popović were steadily and unselfishly involved in the gathering of the ethnographic, folklore and lexical material for Karadžić. Later, other collaborators joined Karadžić, including Milan Đ. Milićević.

The majority of Karadžić&#x27;s works were banned from publishing in Serbia and Austria during the rule of Prince Miloš Obrenović. As observed from a political point of view, Obrenović saw the works of Karadžić as a potential hazard due to a number of apparent reasons, one of which was the possibility that the content of some of the works, although purely poetic in nature, was capable of creating a certain sense of patriotism and a desire for freedom and independence, which very likely might have driven the populace to take up arms against the Turks. This, in turn, would prove detrimental to Prince Miloš&#x27;s politics toward the Ottoman Empire, with whom he had recently forged an uneasy peace. In Montenegro, however, Njegoš&#x27;s printing press operated without the archaic letter known as the &quot;hard sign&quot;. Prince Miloš was to resent Njegoš&#x27;s abandonment of the hard sign, over which, at that time, furious intellectual battles were being waged, with ecclesiastical hierarchy involved as well. Karadžić&#x27;s works, however, did receive high praise and recognition elsewhere, especially in Russian Empire. In addition to this, Karadžić was granted a full pension from the Emperor of All Russia in 1826.

He was married to Ana Maria Kraus from 1818 until the end of his life. They had 13 children together, but only two of them outlived the parents.

Vuk Karadžic died in 1864 in Vienna. He was survived by his wife, by his daughter Mina Karadžić, who was a painter and writer, and by his son Dimitrije Karadžić, a military officer. His remains were relocated to Belgrade in 1897 and buried with great honours next to the grave of Dositej Obradović, in front of St. Michael&#x27;s Cathedral (Belgrade).

==Work==

===Linguistic reforms===
During the latter part of the eighteenth- and the beginning of the nineteenth century, most nations in Western and Eastern Europe underwent a period of language reforms with Germany&#x27;s Johann Christoph Gottsched and Johann Christoph Adelung, Norway&#x27;s Aasmund Olavsson Vinje, Ivar Aasen, and Knud Knudson, Sweden&#x27;s Carl Gustaf af Leopold, Italy&#x27;s Alessandro Manzoni, Spain&#x27;s Andrés Bello, Greece&#x27;s Adamantios Korais, Russia&#x27;s Yakov Grot and others.

At about the same period, Vuk Karadžić reformed the Serbian literary language and standardized the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet by following strict phonemic principles on the Johann Christoph Adelung&#x27; model and Jan Hus&#x27; Czech alphabet. Karadžić&#x27;s reforms of the Serbian literary language modernized it and distanced it from Serbian and Russian Church Slavonic and brought it closer to common folk speech. For example, Karadžić discarded earlier signs and letters that had no match in common Serbian speech, and he introduced 6 Cyrillic letters to make writing the Serbian language simpler. Karadžić also translated the New Testament into Serbian, which was published in 1847.

Because the Slavonic-Serbian written language of the early 19th century contained many words connected to the Orthodox church and a large number of loanwords from Russian Church Slavonic, Karadžić proposed to abandon this written language and to create a new one, based on the Eastern Herzegovina dialect which he spoke. Some Serbian clergy and other linguists opposed him, for example, the Serbian clergy with a base in the area around modern Novi Sad, who viewed grammar and vocabulary of Eastern Herzegovinian dialect as almost a foreign tongue that was unacceptable as basis for a modern language. But Karadžić successfully insisted that his linguistic standard was closer to popular speech and could be understood and written by more people. He called his dialect Herzegovinian because, as he wrote, &quot;Serbian is spoken in the purest and most correct way in Herzegovina and in Bosnia.&quot; Karadžić never visited those lands, but his family roots and speech came from Herzegovina. Ultimately, Vuk Karadžić&#x27;s ideas and linguistic standard won against his clerical and scientific opponents. Karadžić was, together with Đuro Daničić, the main Serbian signatory to the Vienna Literary Agreement of 1850 which, encouraged by Austrian authorities, laid the foundation for the Serbo-Croatian language; Karadžić himself only ever referred to the language as &quot;Serbian&quot;.

The Vukovian effort of language standardization lasted the remainder of the century. Before then the Serbs had achieved a fully independent state (1878), and a flourishing national culture based in Belgrade and Novi Sad. Despite the Vienna agreement, the Serbs had by this time developed an Ekavian pronunciation, which was the native speech of their two cultural capitals as well as the great majority of the Serbian population. Vuk Karadžić greatly influenced South Slavic linguists across southeast Europe. Serbian journals in Austria-Hungary and in Serbia proper began to use his linguistic standard. In Croatia, the linguist Tomislav Maretić acknowledged Karadžić&#x27;s work as foundational to his codification of Croatian grammar.

Karadžić held the view that all South Slavs that speak the Shtokavian dialect were Serbs or of Serbian origin, and considered all of them to speak the Serbian language (for consequences of such idea see Greater Serbia#Vuk Karadžić&#x27;s Pan-Serbism), which was by then and still is today disputed by linguists and historians (see Ethnic affiliation of native speakers of Shtokavian dialect). He personally considered Serbs to be of three different creeds (), specifically of the Orthodox, Catholic and Mohammedan, citing general similarities in local traditions that only differed because of the local religion and, in the case of Catholicism and Islam, foreign influences. However, Karadžić wrote later that he gave up this view because he saw that the Croats of his time did not agree with it, and he switched to the definition of the Serbian nation based on Orthodoxy and the Croatian nation based on Catholicism.

===Literature===

In addition to his linguistic reforms, Karadžić also contributed to folk literature, using peasant culture as the foundation. Because of his peasant upbringing, he closely associated with the oral literature of the peasants, compiling it to use in his collection of folk songs, tales, and proverbs. While Karadžić hardly considered peasant life romantic, he regarded it as an integral part of Serbian culture. He collected several volumes of folk prose and poetry, including a book of over 100 lyrical and epic songs learned as a child and written down from memory. He also published the first dictionary of vernacular Serbian. For his work he received little financial aid, at times living in poverty, though in the very last 9 years he did receive a pension from prince Miloš Obrenović. In some cases Karadžić hid the fact that he had not only collected folk poetry by recording the oral literature but transcribed it from manuscript songbooks of other collectors from Syrmia.

His work had a chief role in establishing the importance of the Kosovo Myth in Serbian national identity and history. Karadžić collected traditional epic poems related to the topic of the Battle of Kosovo and released the so-called &quot;Kosovo cycle&quot;, which became the final version of the transformation of the myth. He mostly published oral songs, with special reference to the heroic deeds of Prince Marko and the Kosovo Battle-related events, just like the singers sang without changes or additions. Karadžić collected most of the poems about Prince Lazar near the monasteries on Fruška Gora, mostly because the seat of the Serbian Orthodox Church was moved there after the Great Migrations of the Serbs.

===Non-philological work===
Besides his greatest achievement on literary field, Karadžić gave his contribution to Serbian anthropology in combination with the ethnography of that time.
He left notes on physical aspects of the human body alongside his ethnographic notes. He introduced a rich terminology on body parts (from head to toes) into the literary language. It should be mentioned that these terms are still used, both in science and everyday speech. He gave, among other things, his own interpretation of the connection between environment and inhabitants, with parts on nourishment, living conditions, hygiene, diseases and funeral customs. All in all this considerable contribution of Vuk Karadžić is not that famous or studied.

==Recognition and legacy==


Literary historian Jovan Deretić summarized his work as &quot;During his fifty years of tireless activity, he accomplished as much as an entire academy of sciences.&quot;

Karadžić was honored across Europe. He was chosen as a member of various European learned societies, including the Imperial Academy of Sciences in Vienna, Prussian Academy of Sciences and Russian Imperial Academy of Sciences. He received several honorary doctorates. and was decorated by Russian and Austro-Hungarian monarchs, Prussian king, Order of Prince Danilo I and Russian academy of science. UNESCO proclaimed 1987 the year of Vuk Karadzić. Karadžić was also named an honorary citizen of the city of Zagreb.

Vukov Sabor cultural event was established in Tršić on the day of the opening of the renovated birth house of Vuk Karadžić, September 17, 1933. Since then it has been held annually in September, with 20-30,000 visitors in attendance. On the 100th anniversary of Karadžić&#x27;s death (in 1964) student work brigades on youth action &quot;Tršić 64&quot; raised an amphitheater with a stage that was needed for organizing the Vukov sabor, and students&#x27; Vukov sabor. In 1987 Tršić received a comprehensive overhaul as a cultural-historical monument. Also, the road from Karadžić&#x27;s home to Tronoša monastery was built. Karadžić&#x27;s birth house was declared Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1979, and it is protected by Republic of Serbia. Recently, rural tourism has become popular in Tršić, with many families converting their houses into buildings designed to accommodate guests. TV series based on his life were broadcast on Radio Television of Serbia. His portrait is often seen in Serbian schools. Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Serbia and Montenegro awarded a state Order of Vuk Karadžić.

Vuk&#x27;s Foundation maintains the legacy of Vuk Stefanović Karadžić in Serbia and Serb diaspora as well. A student of primary (age six or seven to fourteen or fifteen) or secondary (age fourteen or fifteen to eighteen or nineteen) school in Serbia, that is awarded best grades for all subjects at the end of a school year, for each year in turn, is awarded at the end of his final year a &quot;Vuk Karadžić diploma&quot; and is known (in common speech) as &quot;Vukovac&quot;, a name given to a member of an elite group of the highest performing students.

==Misquotes==
Although the above quotation is often attributed to Vuk Stefanović Karadžić in Serbia, it is in fact an orthographic principle devised by the German grammarian and philologist Johann Christoph Adelung. Karadžić merely used that principle to push through his language reform. The attribution of the quote to Karadžić is a common misconception in Serbia, Montenegro and the rest of the former Yugoslavia. Due to that fact, the entrance exam to the University of Belgrade Faculty of Philology occasionally contains a question on the authorship of the quote (as a sort of trick question).

<text>Edwin Alexander Anderson Jr. (16 July 1860 – 23 September 1933) was a United States Navy officer who received the Medal of Honor for actions during the 1914 American intervention at Veracruz. He retired from the Navy in 1924, as an admiral.

==Early life and career==
Anderson was born in Wilmington, North Carolina. He was appointed a cadet midshipman to the United States Naval Academy from the 3rd Congressional District of North Carolina, on 28 June 1878, and graduated with the Class of 1882, receiving his ensign&#x27;s stripe on 1 July 1884, after the customary two-year&#x27;s sea duty.

Anderson advanced slowly up the promotion ladder, such advancements in those times being received on basis of seniority; he remained an ensign for ten years before becoming a lieutenant, junior grade. Detached from the cruiser , Anderson reported on board the cruiser on 28 January 1897, and was serving in that ship at the time of the outbreak of the Spanish–American War in the spring of 1898.

==Spanish–American War==
At that time, the United States Navy threw a blockade around Cuba. By early May 1898, &quot;Marblehead&quot; was operating off the south coast of Cuba, off the port of Cienfuegos—a cable terminus important to Spanish communications—in company with the converted yacht , the gunboat , the revenue cutter and the collier .

To sever this vital link, Captain Bowman H. McCalla, senior officer in the group, planned an operation to cut the cable at Cienfuegos, designating Lieutenant Cameron McRae Winslow as the commanding officer, with Lieutenant, (jg) Anderson as his second-in-command. Winslow accordingly gave Anderson command of the sailing launches from &quot;Marblehead&quot;.

After the guns of the two warships smashed Spanish positions ashore, the boats moved in to carry out the operation. Anderson&#x27;s boat quickly snatched up the first cable and, assisted by &quot;Nashville&quot;″s boat, cut it. They soon grapneled a second cable and were in the process of cutting it, too, when the Spaniards opened a slow fire that soon grew to volley proportions, from rifles, automatic weapons and one-pounders. After a Spanish bullet felled the coxswain of Anderson&#x27;s boat, Anderson took the helm and began steering the boat seaward, directing his men to keep down between the thwarts. The Spanish fire, however wounded three more men and holed the boat in many places. After the action, Anderson had nothing but praise for his sailors and marines, commending their intelligent and cheerful work in the exhausting labor of picking up and cutting the heavy cables, working even under heavy fire until ordered to stop. The operation proved successful in another aspect. The ships gunfire decimated a large Spanish force sent to the area to contest the operation.

Subsequently, Anderson delivered the prize steamer &quot;Adula&quot; to Savannah, Georgia, in July 1898, and was given command of another Spanish prize, the gunboat . Recommended for advancement in grade for his heroism at Cienfuegos in August 1898, this advancement (five numbers in grade) came finally on 11 February 1901.

==Post-war advancement, Medal of Honor==
Anderson commanded the gunboat from 13 April 1901 – 24 December 1903, in the Philippines, and, later, in Hong Kong. During the remainder of the 1900s, Anderson advanced to commander; among his tours of duty included a stint at the Navy Recruiting Station, Cincinnati, Ohio, and at the Mare Island Navy Yard as ordnance officer before being given command of the gunboat in the autumn of 1910. He briefly commanded the battleship during the assemblage the fleet in New York City before being detached for duty as Captain of the Yard at the Philadelphia Navy Yard.

Late in 1913, Anderson was given command of the battleship , and while in command of that ship, took part in the American intervention at Veracruz, Mexico, in April 1914. Given command of the Second Seaman Regiment, Anderson led that bluejacket landing force ashore and so distinguished himself in the fighting that followed that he received the Medal of Honor.

Subsequently attending the Naval War College, Anderson served as Supervisor of Naval Auxiliary Reserves, Norfolk, and later as Commander, Squadron Three, Patrol Force, assigned defense duties out of Key West, Florida, during World War I, with as his flagship. He was promoted to rear admiral and took command of Squadron One, Patrol Force, Atlantic Fleet, for the duration of the First World War.

==Flag assignments==
Over the next few years, Anderson flew his flag as Commander Division 1, Cruiser Squadrons, Atlantic Fleet, and as Commandant, Sixth Naval district, headquartered at Charleston, South Carolina, before assuming command of United States Naval Forces in European Waters, with the rank of vice admiral. He was soon redesignated as Commander in Chief, Asiatic Fleet, however from 28 August 1922.

Continued turmoil in China had occasioned the presence of substantial numbers of foreign warships in Chinese waters including the Asiatic Fleet. Anderson&#x27;s ships carried out the usual kinds of peacetime operations ever ready to perform protective service for American nationals. During his tour, however the Fleet distinguished itself in quite an unexpected fashion.

A severe earthquake rocked Japan, causing heavy damage to such cities as Tokyo and Yokohama. As Secretary of the Navy Edwin C. Denby reported in 1923, &quot;One of the brightest pages in the history of the Navy has recently been written by the Asiatic Fleet in its mission of mercy to the stricken people of Japan.&quot; Admiral Anderson promptly placed his fleet at the disposal of the Japanese, immediately dispatched a division of destroyer from Chinese waters to Yokohama with medical supplies to render assistance. The ships of Destroyer Division 38, led by the destroyer , were in fact the first ships to render assistance to the city of Yokohama. All available naval vessels were laden with clothing, food, medicines, and supplies, and rushed to Japanese waters. Admiral Anderson himself arrived at Yokohama in his flagship the armored cruiser on the afternoon of September 1923.

Within two weeks&#x27; time, the United States Ambassador in Japan, Cyrus E. Woods, could cable:
:I have been informed by the Foreign Office that food emergency has been met. Only problem remaining is question of distribution. This the Japanese with their organizing ability and their ability to recover from shock desire to handle themselves. It will gratify the American people to know that the prompt action of Admiral Anderson has had much to do with this. American Navy&#x27;s assistance thoroughly appreciated by the men in the street as well as the Japanese government. I wish to emphasize that in this critical emergency the first assistance from the outside world since the catastrophe was brought by our Asiatic Fleet.

Subsequently, the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Masanao Hanihara, expressed gratitude for Admiral Anderson&#x27;s &quot;unflagging zeal and efficiency&quot; that led to the &quot;prompt and gallant assistance&quot; that enabled the situation to be brought &quot;well under control in a short time.&quot;

==Retirement and death==
Relieved by Admiral Thomas Washington on 11 October 1923, Anderson returned to the United States, and was placed on the retired list with the permanent rank of admiral on 23 March 1924.

Anderson died at his home in Masonboro Sound, Wilmington, North Carolina on 23 September 1933. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, in Arlington, Virginia.

<text>Dieffenbachia , commonly known as dumb cane leopard lily, is a genus of tropical flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is native to the New World Tropics from Mexico and the West Indies south to Argentina. Some species are widely cultivated as ornamental plants, especially as houseplants, and have become naturalized on a few tropical islands.

&quot;Dieffenbachia&quot; is a perennial herbaceous plant with straight stem, simple and alternate leaves containing white spots and flecks, making it attractive as indoor foliage. Species in this genus are popular as houseplants because of their tolerance of shade. The English names, dumb cane and mother-in-law&#x27;s tongue (also used for &quot;Sansevieria&quot; species) refer to the poisoning effect of raphides, which can cause temporary inability to speak. &quot;Dieffenbachia&quot; was named by Heinrich Wilhelm Schott, director of the Botanical Gardens in Vienna, to honor his head gardener Joseph Dieffenbach (1790–1863).

==Ecology==
In a survey that began in 1998, researchers in Costa Rica noticed that the strawberry poison frog &quot;Oophaga pumilio&quot;, deposited almost all (89%) of their tadpoles on the leaf axils of &quot;Dieffenbachia&quot;. As a result, the frog population fluctuated with the abundance of &quot;Dieffenbachia&quot;, especially in secondary forests
. A majority of the plants were eradicated by 2012 when the surveyors returned to the same area, with only 28% of 2002 plant numbers remaining. Researchers concluded that the reason for the rapid decline in &quot;Dieffenbachia&quot; was due to increased abundance of the collared peccary &quot;Dicotyles tajacu&quot; in the La Selva Biological Station research area; a small pig-like animal that feeds on &quot;Dieffenbachia&quot; and other plants.

==Cultivation==
With a minimum temperature of , dieffenbachia must be grown indoors in temperate areas. They need light, but filtered sunlight through a window is usually sufficient. They also need moderately moist soil, which should be regularly fertilized with an appropriate houseplant fertilizer. Leaves will periodically roll up and fall off to make way for new leaves. Yellowing of the leaves is generally a sign of problematic conditions, such as a nutrient deficiency in the soil. Dieffenbachia respond well to hot temperatures and dry climates.

Dieffenbachia prefer medium sunlight, moderately dry soil and average home temperatures of . Most require water about twice a week.

As &quot;Dieffenbachia seguine&quot; comes from the tropical rain forest, it prefers to have moisture at its roots, as it grows all the time, it needs constant water, but with loose well aerated soils.

The cultivars &#x27;Camille&#x27; and &#x27;Tropic Snow&#x27; have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

==Toxicity==
The cells of the &quot;Dieffenbachia&quot; plant contain needle-shaped calcium oxalate crystals called raphides. If a leaf is chewed, these crystals can cause a temporary burning sensation and erythema. In rare cases, edema of tissues exposed to the plant has been reported. Mastication and ingestion generally result in only mild symptoms. With both children and pets, contact with &quot;Dieffenbachia&quot; (typically from chewing) can cause a host of unpleasant symptoms, including intense numbing, oral irritation, excessive drooling, and localized swelling. However, these effects are rarely life-threatening. In most cases, symptoms are mild, and can be successfully treated with analgesic agents, antihistamines, or medical charcoal. 

Severe cases can occur if &quot;Dieffenbachia&quot; makes prolonged contact with oral mucosal tissue. In such cases, symptoms generally include severe pain which can last for several days to weeks. Hospitalization may be necessary if prolonged contact is made with the throat, in which severe swelling has the potential to affect breathing. 

Gastric evacuation or lavage is seldom indicated. In patients with exposure to toxic plants, 70% are children younger than 5 years.

Stories that &quot;Dieffenbachia&quot; is a deadly poison are urban legends.

<doc id="229254" wikidata="Q412399" url="?curid=229254" title="Calcium oxalate">
<text>Calcium oxalate (in archaic terminology, oxalate of lime) is a calcium salt of oxalic acid with the chemical formula or . It forms hydrates , where &quot;n&quot; varies from 1 to 3. Anhydrous and all hydrated forms are colorless or white. The monohydrate occurs naturally as the mineral whewellite, forming envelope-shaped crystals, known in plants as raphides. The two rarer hydrates are dihydrate , which occurs naturally as the mineral weddellite, and trihydrate , which occurs naturally as the mineral caoxite, are also recognized. Some foods have high quantities of calcium oxalates and can produce sores and numbing on ingestion and may even be fatal. Cultural groups with diets that depend highly on fruits and vegetables high in calcium oxalate, such as those in Micronesia, reduce the level of it by boiling and cooking them. They are a constituent in 76% of human kidney stones. Calcium oxalate is also found in beerstone, a scale that forms on containers used in breweries.

==Occurrence==
Many plants accumulate calcium oxalate as it has been reported in more than 1000 different genera of plants. The calcium oxalate accumulation is linked to the detoxification of calcium () in the plant. Upon decomposition, the calcium oxalate is oxidised by bacteria, fungi, or wildfire to produce the soil nutrient calcium carbonate.

The poisonous plant dumb cane (&quot;Dieffenbachia&quot;) contains the substance and on ingestion can prevent speech and be suffocating. It is also found in sorrel, rhubarb (in large quantities in the leaves), cinnamon, turmeric and in species of &quot;Oxalis&quot;, Araceae, &quot;Arum italicum&quot;, taro, kiwifruit, tea leaves, agaves, Virginia creeper (&quot;Parthenocissus quinquefolia&quot;), and &quot;Alocasia&quot; and in spinach in varying amounts. Plants of the genus &quot;Philodendron&quot; contain enough calcium oxalate that consumption of parts of the plant can result in uncomfortable symptoms. Insoluble calcium oxalate crystals are found in plant stems, roots, and leaves and produced in idioblasts. Vanilla plants exude calcium oxalates upon harvest of the orchid seed pods and may cause contact dermatitis.

Calcium oxalate crystals are commonly found in lichens, where they occur in two mineral forms: weddellite (CaC2O4·(2+x)H2O) and whewellite (CaC2O4·H2O). These crystals can form both on the surface of the lichen as a powdery coating called and within the internal structures of the lichen thallus. The type and distribution of these crystals often correlates with environmental conditions: weddellite typically forms in dry environments and can serve as a water source for the lichen, while whewellite is more common in moist habitats. In addition to water regulation, calcium oxalate crystals in lichens serve several protective functions, including shielding against excessive sunlight and potentially helping to neutralize pollutants such as sulfur dioxide. The formation of these crystals is linked to the lichen&#x27;s ability to dissolve calcium from rocky substrates through the production of oxalic acid, with the amount of calcium oxalate often correlating with the calcium content of the substrate on which the lichen grows.

Calcium oxalate, as ‘beerstone’, is a brownish precipitate that tends to accumulate within vats, barrels, and other containers used in the brewing of beer. If not removed in a cleaning process, beerstone will leave an unsanitary surface that can harbour microorganisms. Beerstone is composed of calcium and magnesium salts and various organic compounds left over from the brewing process; it promotes the growth of unwanted microorganisms that can adversely affect or even ruin the flavour of a batch of beer.

Calcium oxalate crystals in the urine are the most common constituent of human kidney stones, and calcium oxalate crystal formation is also one of the toxic effects of ethylene glycol poisoning.

== Chemical properties ==
Calcium oxalate is a combination of calcium ions and the conjugate base of oxalic acid, the oxalate anion. Its aqueous solutions are slightly basic because of the basicity of the oxalate ion. The basicity of calcium oxalate is weaker than that of sodium oxalate, due to its lower solubility in water. Solid calcium oxalate hydrate has been characterized by X-ray crystallography. It is a coordination polymer featuring planar oxalate anions linked to calcium, which also has water ligands.

==Medical significance==
Calcium oxalate can produce sores and numbing on ingestion and may even be fatal.

===Morphology and diagnosis===
The monohydrate and dihydrate can be distinguished by the shape of the respective crystals. 
* Calcium oxalate &quot;dihydrate&quot; crystals are octahedral. A large portion of the crystals in a urine sediment will have this type of morphology, as they can grow at any pH and naturally occur in normal urine.
* Calcium oxalate &quot;monohydrate&quot; crystals vary in shape, and can be shaped like dumbbells, spindles, ovals, or picket fences, the last of which is most commonly seen due to ethylene glycol poisoning.
===Kidney stones===
About 76% of kidney stones are partially or entirely of the calcium oxalate type. They form when urine is persistently saturated with calcium and oxalate. Between 1% and 15% of people globally are affected by kidney stones at some point. In 2015, they caused about 16,000 deaths worldwide.

Some of the oxalate in urine is produced by the body. Calcium and oxalate in the diet play a part but are not the only factors that affect the formation of calcium oxalate stones. Dietary oxalate is an organic ion found in many vegetables, fruits, and nuts. Calcium from bone may also play a role in kidney stone formation.

==Industrial applications==
Calcium oxalate is used in the manufacture of ceramic glazes.
