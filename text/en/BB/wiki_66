<text>Johann Carl Otto Ribbeck (23 July 1827, in Erfurt – 18 July 1898, in Leipzig) was a German classical scholar. His works are mostly confined to criticisms of Latin poetry and to classical character sketches.

==Biography==
He was born at Erfurt in Saxony. In early life he went to Berlin, where he studied under Karl Lachmann, Franz Bopp and August Böckh, and from there to Bonn where he was a close student of the methods of Friedrich Gottlieb Welcker and Friedrich Ritschl. Having received his degree in Berlin and traveled for a year through Italy, in 1853 he returned to Berlin, where he entered Böckh&#x27;s school. He then taught at Elberfeld and Bern. Having held professorial appointments at Kiel and Heidelberg, he succeeded Ritschl in the chair of classical philology at Leipzig, where he died.

==Work==
Ribbeck was the author of several standard works on the poets and poetry of Rome, the most important of which are the following: &quot;Geschichte der römischen Dichtung&quot; (&quot;History of Roman poetry,&quot; 2nd ed., 1894–1900); &quot;Die römische Tragodie im Zeitalter der Republik&quot; (&quot;Roman tragedy during the time of the republic,&quot; 1875); &quot;Scaenicae Romanorum Poesis Fragmenta&quot;, including the tragic and comic fragments (3rd ed., 1897).

As a textual critic he was distinguished by considerable rashness, and never hesitated to alter, rearrange or reject as spurious what failed to reach his standard of excellence. These tendencies are strikingly shown in his editions of the &quot;Epistles&quot; and &quot;Ars Poetica&quot; of Horace (1869), the Satires of Juvenal (1859) and in the supplementary essay &quot;Der echte und unechte Juvenal&quot; (&quot;Genuine and fraudulent Juvenal,&quot; 1865). In later years, however, he became much more conservative.

His edition of Virgil (&quot;Vergilii Opera&quot;, with prolegomena and critical notes, 5 vols., 1859–69; 2nd ed., 1894–1895), although only critical, is a work of great erudition, especially the prolegomena. His biography of Ritschl (1879–1881) is one of the best works of its kind. The influence of Ritschl may be seen in Ribbeck&#x27;s critical edition of the &quot;Miles gloriosus&quot; of Plautus, and in his &quot;Beiträge zur Lehre von den lateinischen Partikeln&quot; (&quot;Contributions to the teachings on Latin particles&quot;), a work of much promise, which causes regret that he did not publish further results of his studies in that direction. His miscellaneous &quot;Reden und Vorträge&quot; were published after his death (Leipzig, 1899). He took great interest in the monumental &quot;Thesaurus Linguae Latinae&quot;, and it was chiefly owing to his efforts that the government of Saxony was induced to assist its production by a considerable subsidy. Classical character sketches (which appeared in the &quot;Rheinische Museum&quot;, of which he became editor in 1876) include &quot;Alazon&quot; (1882), &quot;Kolax&quot; (1885) and &quot;Agrockos&quot; (1885).

<doc id="235902" wikidata="Q502102" url="?curid=235902" title="Borehole">
<text>A borehole is a narrow shaft bored in the ground, either vertically or horizontally. A borehole may be constructed for many different purposes, including the extraction of water (drilled water well and tube well), other liquids (such as petroleum), or gases (such as natural gas). It may also be part of a geotechnical investigation, environmental site assessment, mineral exploration, temperature measurement, as a pilot hole for installing piers or underground utilities, for geothermal installations, or for underground storage of unwanted substances, e.g. in carbon capture and storage.

==Importance ==
Engineers and environmental consultants use the term &quot;borehole&quot; to collectively describe all of the various types of holes drilled as part of a geotechnical investigation or environmental site assessment (a so-called Phase II ESA). This includes holes advanced to collect soil samples, water samples or rock cores, to advance &quot;in situ&quot; sampling equipment, or to install monitoring wells or piezometers. Samples collected from boreholes are often tested in a laboratory to determine their physical properties, or to assess levels of various chemical constituents or contaminants.

Typically, a borehole used as a water well is completed by installing a vertical pipe (casing) and well screen to keep the borehole from caving. This also helps prevent surface contaminants from entering the borehole and protects any installed pump from drawing in sand and sediment. Oil and natural gas wells are completed in a similar, albeit usually more complex, manner.

As detailed in proxy (climate), borehole temperature measurements at a series of different depths can be effectively &quot;inverted&quot; (a mathematical formula to solve a matrix equation) to help estimate historic surface temperatures.

Clusters of small-diameter boreholes equipped with heat exchangers made of plastic PEX pipe can be used to store heat or cold between opposing seasons in a mass of native rock. The technique is called seasonal thermal energy storage. Media that can be used for this technique ranges from gravel to bedrock. There can be a few to several hundred boreholes, and in practice, depths have ranged from .

==History==
Borehole drilling has a long history. By at least the Han dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD), the Chinese used deep borehole drilling for mining and other projects. The British sinologist and historian Michael Loewe states that borehole sites could reach as deep as . K.S. Tom describes the drilling process: &quot;The Chinese method of deep drilling was accomplished by a team of men jumping on and off a beam to impact the drilling bit while the boring tool was rotated by buffalo and oxen.&quot; This was the same method used for extracting petroleum in California during the 1860s (i.e. &quot;kicking her down&quot;). A Western Han dynasty bronze foundry discovered in Xinglong, Hebei had nearby mining shafts which reached depths of with spacious mining areas; the shafts and rooms were complete with a timber frame, ladders and iron tools. By the first century BC, Chinese craftsmen cast iron drill bits and drillers were able to drill boreholes up to deep. By the eleventh century AD, the Chinese were able to drill boreholes up to in depth. Drilling for boreholes was time-consuming and long. As the depth of the holes varied, the drilling of a single well could last nearly one full decade. It was not up until the 19th century that Europe and the West would catch up and rival ancient Chinese borehole drilling technology.

For many years, the world&#x27;s longest borehole was the Kola Superdeep Borehole in Russia. From 2011 until August 2012 the record was held by the long Sakhalin-I Odoptu OP-11 Well, offshore the Russian island Sakhalin. The Chayvo Z-44 extended-reach well took the title of the world&#x27;s longest borehole on 27 August 2012. Z-44&#x27;s total measured depth is . However, ERD wells are more shallow than the Kola Borehole, owing to a large horizontal displacement. In July 2023, China began drilling deep boreholes, one at the Sichuan Basin expected to reach into the ground and the other at the Tarim Basin with a planned depth of .

== Methodology ==

Drillers may sink a borehole using a drilling rig or a hand-operated rig. The machinery and techniques to advance a borehole vary considerably according to manufacturer, geological conditions, and the intended purpose. For offshore drilling floating units or platforms supported by the seafloor are used for the drilling rig.

== Hand digging ==

Especially in developing countries many boreholes are stull dug by hand. The digging begins with manual labor using basic tools such as shovels, picks, and crowbars. Workers excavate the soil layer by layer, often using a circular motion to create a well-shaped hole. The process is slow and demanding, requiring teamwork and coordination. To prevent the walls from collapsing and to ensure water quality, the borehole is lined with materials like bricks, stones, or concrete rings. This reinforcement maintains the integrity of the borehole&#x27;s structure and helps to prevent contamination. A concrete platform or slab may be installed at the bottom to prevent sediment from entering the water. The top of the borehole is capped to protect it from debris and contamination.

<text>Dimitri Zinovievich Tiomkin (May 10, 1894 – November 11, 1979) was a Russian and American film composer and conductor. Classically trained in Saint Petersburg before the Bolshevik Revolution, he moved to Berlin and then New York City after the Russian Revolution. In 1929, after the stock market crash, he moved to Hollywood, where he became best known for his scores for Western films, including &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot;, &quot;Red River&quot;, &quot;High Noon&quot;, &quot;The Big Sky&quot;, &quot;Gunfight at the O.K. Corral&quot;, &quot;Rio Bravo&quot;, and &quot;Last Train from Gun Hill&quot;.

Tiomkin received 22 Academy Award nominations and won four Oscars, three for Best Original Score for &quot;High Noon&quot;, &quot;The High and the Mighty&quot;, and &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;, and one for Best Original Song for &quot;The Ballad of High Noon&quot; from the film &quot;High Noon&quot;.

==Early life and education==

Dimitri Tiomkin was born in Kremenchug, Poltava Governorate, Russian Empire (today part of Ukraine).

His family was of Jewish descent; his father, Zinovy Tiomkin, was a &quot;distinguished pathologist&quot; and associate of professor Paul Ehrlich, and later a notable Zionist leader. His mother, Maria Tartakovskaya, was a musician who began teaching the young Tiomkin piano at an early age. Her hope was to have her son become a professional pianist, according to Tiomkin biographer Christopher Palmer. Tiomkin described his mother as being &quot;small, blonde, merry and vivacious.&quot;

Tiomkin was educated at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, where he studied piano with Felix Blumenfeld, teacher of Vladimir Horowitz, and harmony and counterpoint with Alexander Glazunov, mentor to Sergei Prokofiev and Dmitri Shostakovich. He also studied piano with Isabelle Vengerova.

He survived the revolution and found work under the new regime. In 1920, while working for the Petrograd Military District Political Administration (PUR), Tiomkin was one of the lead organizers of two revolutionary mass spectacles, the &quot;Mystery of Liberated Labor,&quot; a pseudo-religious mystery play for the May Day festivities, and &quot;The Storming of the Winter Palace&quot; for the celebrations of the third anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution. He supported himself while living in Saint Petersburg by playing piano accompaniment for numerous Russian silent films.

Because the revolution had diminished opportunities for classical musicians in Russia, Tiomkin joined many exiles in moving to Berlin after the Russian Revolution to live with his father. In Berlin, from 1921 to 1923, he studied with the pianist Ferruccio Busoni and Busoni&#x27;s disciples Egon Petri and . He composed light classical and popular music, and made his performing debut as a pianist playing Franz Liszt&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 2 with the Berlin Philharmonic.

He moved to Paris with his roommate, Michael Khariton, to perform a piano duo repertory together. They did this before the end of 1924.

==Life in the United States==
In 1925 the duo received an offer from the New York theatrical producer Morris Gest and emigrated to the United States. They performed together on the Keith/Albee and Orpheum vaudeville circuits, in which they accompanied a ballet troupe run by the Austrian ballerina Albertina Rasch. Tiomkin and Rasch&#x27;s professional relationship evolved into a personal one, and they married in 1927.

While in New York, Tiomkin gave a recital at Carnegie Hall that featured contemporary music by Maurice Ravel, Alexander Scriabin, Francis Poulenc, and Alexandre Tansman. He and his new wife went on tour to Paris in 1928, where he played the European premiere of American George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Concerto in F&quot; at the Paris Opera, with Gershwin in the audience.

After the stock market crash in October 1929 reduced work opportunities in New York, Tiomkin and his wife moved to Hollywood, where she was hired to supervise dance numbers in MGM film musicals. He worked on some minor films, some without being credited under his own name. His first significant film score project was for Paramount&#x27;s &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1933). Although Tiomkin worked on some smaller film projects, his goal was to become a concert pianist. In 1937 he broke his arm, injuring it so much that he ended that possible career. He began to focus on work as a film music composer.

===Working for Frank Capra (1937–1946)===
Tiomkin received his first break from Columbia director Frank Capra, who chose him to write and perform the score for &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; (1937). The film gained significant recognition for Tiomkin in Hollywood. It was released the same year that he became a naturalized US citizen.

In his autobiography, &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Hate Me!&quot; (1959), Tiomkin recalls how the assignment by Capra forced him to first confront a director in a matter of music style:


He worked on other Capra films during the following decade, including the comedy &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It With You&quot; (1938), &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; (1939), &quot;Meet John Doe&quot; (1941), and &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; (1946). During World War II, he continued his close collaboration with Capra by composing scores for his &quot;Why We Fight&quot; series. These seven films were commissioned by the US government to show American soldiers the reason for United States&#x27; participation in the war. They were later released to the general US public to generate support for American involvement.

Tiomkin credited Capra for broadening his musical horizons by shifting them away from a purely Eurocentric and romantic style to a more American style based on subject matter and story.

===&quot;High Noon&quot; (1952)===
Following his work for Fred Zinnemann on &quot;The Men&quot; (1950), Tiomkin composed the score for the same director&#x27;s &quot;High Noon&quot; (1952). His theme song was &quot;Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darlin&#x27;&quot; (&quot;The Ballad of High Noon&quot;). At its opening preview to the press, the film, which starred Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly, did badly. Tiomkin writes that &quot;film experts agreed that the picture was a flat failure... The producers hesitated to release the picture.&quot; Tiomkin bought the rights to the song and released it as a single for the popular music market, with singer Frankie Laine. The record became an immediate success worldwide. 
Based on the song&#x27;s popularity, the studio released the film four months later, with the words sung by country western star Tex Ritter. The film received seven Academy Award nominations and won four awards, including two for Tiomkin: Best Original Music and Best Song. Walt Disney presented him with both awards that evening.

According to film historian Arthur R. Jarvis Jr., the score &quot;has been credited with saving the movie.&quot; Another music expert, Mervyn Cooke, agrees, adding that &quot;the song&#x27;s spectacular success was partly responsible for changing the course of film-music history&quot;. Tiomkin was the second composer to receive two Oscars (score and song) for the same dramatic film. (The first was Leigh Harline, who won Best Original Score for Disney&#x27;s &quot;Pinocchio&quot; and Best Song for &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot;. Ned Washington wrote its lyrics as he did for &quot;Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darlin&quot;.)

The song&#x27;s lyrics briefly tell &quot;High Noon&quot;″s entire story arc, a tale of cowardice and conformity in a small Western town. Tiomkin composed his entire score around this single western-style ballad. He also eliminated violins from the ensemble. He added a subtle harmonica in the background, to give the film a &quot;rustic, deglamorized sound that suits the anti-heroic sentiments&quot; expressed by the story.

According to Russian film historian Harlow Robinson, building the score around a single folk tune was typical of many Russian classical composers. Robinson adds that the source of Tiomkin&#x27;s score, if indeed folk, has not been proven. The &quot;Encyclopedia of Modern Jewish Culture&quot;, on page 124, states: &quot;The fifty-year period in the USA between 1914, the start of the First World War and the year of Irving Berlin&#x27;s first full score, &quot;Watch Your Step&quot;, and 1964, the premiere of Bock and Harnick&#x27;s &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;, is informed by a rich musical legacy from Yiddish folk tunes (for example Mark Warshavsky&#x27;s &quot;Di milners trem,&quot; The miller&#x27;s tears: and Dimitri Tiomkin&#x27;s &quot;Do Not Forsake Me.&quot; High Noon) ... &quot;

Tiomkin won two more Oscars in subsequent years: for &quot;The High and the Mighty&quot; (1954), directed by William A. Wellman, and featuring John Wayne; and &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; (1958), adapted from an Ernest Hemingway novel. During the 1955 ceremonies, Tiomkin thanked all of the earlier composers who had influenced him, including Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, and other names from the European classical tradition.

The composer worked again for Zinnemann on &quot;The Sundowners&quot; (1960).

===Film genres and other associations===
Many of his scores were for Western films, which were extremely popular in this period, and for which he is best remembered. His first Western was the King Vidor-directed &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; (1946). In addition to &quot;High Noon&quot;, among his other Westerns were &quot;Giant&quot; (1956), &quot;Friendly Persuasion&quot; (1956), &quot;Gunfight at the O.K. Corral&quot; (1957), and &quot;Last Train from Gun Hill&quot; (1959). &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; (1959), &quot;The Alamo&quot; (1960), &quot;Circus World&quot; (1964) and &quot;The War Wagon&quot; (1967) were made with the involvement of John Wayne. Tiomkin received Oscar nominations for his scores in both &quot;Giant&quot; and &quot;The Alamo&quot;. He told TV host Gig Young that his aim in creating the score for &quot;Giant&quot; was to capture the &quot;feelings of the great land and great state of Texas.&quot;

Although influenced by European music traditions, Tiomkin was self-trained as a film composer. He scored many films of various genres, including historical dramas such as &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; (1950), &quot;The Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; (1964), and &quot;Great Catherine&quot; (1968); war movies such as &quot;The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell&quot; (1955), &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; (1961), and &quot;Town Without Pity&quot; (1961); and suspense thrillers such as &quot;36 Hours&quot; (1965).

Tiomkin also wrote scores for four of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s suspense dramas: &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot; (1943), &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; (1951), &quot;I Confess&quot; (1953), and &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; (1954). Here he used a lush style relying on solo violins and muted trumpets. He composed the score for the science fiction thriller &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot; (1951), which is considered his &quot;strangest and most experimental score.&quot; He also worked with Howard Hawks on &quot;The Big Sky&quot; (1952) and &quot;Land of the Pharaohs&quot; (1955), with John Huston on &quot;The Unforgiven&quot; (1960), and with Nicholas Ray on &quot;55 Days at Peking&quot; (1963).

===Television===
In addition to the cinema, Tiomkin composed for television, including such memorable theme songs as &quot;Rawhide&quot; (1959) and &quot;Gunslinger.&quot; Although Tiomkin was hired to compose the theme for &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; (1965), the producers rejected his music and subsequently hired Richard Markowitz as his replacement.

Tiomkin also made a few cameo appearances on television programs. These include being the mystery challenger on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; and an appearance on Jack Benny&#x27;s CBS program in December 1961, in which he attempted to help Benny write a song. He also appeared as a contestant on the October 20, 1955, episode of the TV quiz program &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;, hosted by Groucho Marx.

He composed the music to the song &quot;Wild Is The Wind&quot;. It was originally recorded by Johnny Mathis for the film &quot;Wild Is the Wind&quot; (1957).

===Composition styles and significance===
Although Tiomkin was a trained classical pianist, he adapted his music training in Russia to the rapidly expanding Hollywood film industry, and taught himself how to compose meaningful film scores for almost any story type. Film historian David Wallace notes that despite Tiomkin&#x27;s indebtedness to Europe&#x27;s classical composers, he would go on to express more than any other composer, &quot;the American spirit—its frontier spirit, anyway—in film music.&quot;

Tiomkin had no illusions about his talent and the nature of his film work when compared to the classical composers. &quot;I am no Prokofiev, I am no Tchaikovsky. But what I write is good for what I write for. So please, boys, help me.&quot; Upon receiving his Oscar in 1955 for &quot;The High and the Mighty&quot;, he became the first composer to publicly list and thank the great European masters, including Beethoven, Strauss, and Brahms, among others.

Music historian Christopher Palmer says that Tiomkin&#x27;s &quot;genius lay in coming up with themes and finding vivid ways of creating sonic color appropriate to the story and visual image, not in his ability to combine the themes into a complex symphonic structure that could stand on its own.&quot; In addition he speculates how a Russian-born pianist like Tiomkin, who was educated at a respected Russian music conservatory, could have become so successful in the American film industry:

Tiomkin alluded to this relationship in his autobiography:

===Techniques of composing===
Tiomkin&#x27;s methods of composing a film score have been analyzed and described by music experts. Musicologist Dave Epstein, for one, has explained that after reading the script, Tiomkin would then outline the film&#x27;s major themes and movements. After the film itself has been filmed, he would make a detailed study of the timing of scenes, using a stopwatch to arrange precise synchronization of the music with the scenes. He would complete the final score after assembling all the musicians and orchestra, rehearse a number of times, and then record the final soundtrack.

Tiomkin paid careful attention to the voices of the actors when composing. According to Epstein, he &quot;found that in addition to the timbre of the voice, the pitch of the speaking voice must be very carefully considered...&quot; To accomplish this, Tiomkin would go to the set during filming and would listen to each of the actors. He would also talk with them individually, noting the pitch and color of their voices.

Tiomkin explains why he took the extra time with actors:
==Death==
Dimitri Tiomkin died in London, England, in 1979 two weeks after fracturing his pelvis in a fall. He was interred in Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

==Legacy==
During the 1950s Tiomkin was the highest-paid film composer, composing close to a rate of a picture each month, achieving his greatest fame during the 1950s and 1960s. Between 1948 and 1958, his &quot;golden decade,&quot; he composed 57 film scores. In 1952 he composed nine film scores, including &quot;High Noon&quot;, for which he won two Academy Awards. In the same decade, he won two more Oscars and his film scores were nominated nine times.

In his lifetime, Tiomkin became known both for a memorable 1954 awards acceptance and for his ability to learn language . During his televised 1954 Oscars acceptance speech for &quot;The High and the Mighty&quot;, it was noted that Tiomkin thanked classical composers Bach, Brahms, Beethoven, and Debussy rather than his modern-day colleagues. A 1957 &quot;New York Times&quot; article stated that Tiomkin had learned to speak Russian, German, Polish, Ukrainian, French, Italian, Yiddish, and English.

He was honored in the Soviet Union and Russia. In 1967, he was a member of the jury of the 5th Moscow International Film Festival. In 2014, his theme songs to &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; and &quot;Giant&quot; were played during the closing ceremony for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.

Beginning with &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; in 1937, through his retirement from films in 1979, and until modern times, he is recognized as being the only Russian to have become a Hollywood film composer. Other Russian-born composers, such as Irving Berlin, wrote their scores for Broadway plays, many of which were later adapted to film.

Tiomkin was the first film score composer to write both the title theme song and the score. He expanded on that technique in many of his westerns, including &quot;High Noon&quot; and &quot;Gunfight at the O.K. Corral,&quot; in which the theme song was repeated as a common thread running through the entire film. For the film &quot;Red River&quot; his biographer Christopher Palmer describes how the music immediately sets the epic and heroic tone for the film:

Because of this stylistic contribution to westerns, along with other film genres, using title and ongoing theme songs, he had the greatest impact on Hollywood films in the following decades up until the present. With many of his songs being used in the title of films, Tiomkin created what composer Irwin Bazelon called &quot;title song mania.&quot; In subsequent decades, studios often attempted to create their own hit songs to both sell as a soundtrack and to enhance the movie experience, with a typical example being the film score for &quot;Titanic&quot;.

He was known to use &quot;source music&quot; in his scores. Some experts claim these were often based on Russian folk songs. Much of his film music, especially for westerns, was used to create an atmosphere of &quot;broad, sweeping landscapes,&quot; with a prominent use of chorus.

During a TV interview, he credited his love of the European classic composers along with his ability to adapt American folk music styles to creating grand American theme music.

A number of Tiomkin&#x27;s film scores were released on LP soundtrack albums, including &quot;Giant&quot; and &quot;The Alamo&quot;. Some of the recordings, which usually featured Tiomkin conducting his own music, have been reissued on CD. The theme song to &quot;High Noon&quot; has been recorded by many artists, with one German CD producer, Bear Family Records, producing a CD with 25 different artists performing that one song.

In 1999, the US Postal Service added his image to their &quot;Legends of American Music&quot; stamp series. The series began with the issuance of one featuring singer Elvis Presley in 1993. Tiomkin&#x27;s image was added as part of their &quot;Hollywood Composers&quot; selection.

In 1976, RCA Victor released &quot;Lost Horizon: The Classic Film Scores of Dimitri Tiomkin&quot; (US catalog #ARL1-1669, UK catalog #GL 43445) with Charles Gerhardt and the National Philharmonic Orchestra. Featuring highlights from various Tiomkin scores, the album was later reissued by RCA on CD with Dolby Surround Sound.

The American Film Institute ranked Tiomkin&#x27;s score for &quot;High Noon&quot; as No. 10 on their list of the 100 greatest film scores. His scores for the following films were also nominated for the list: 
*&quot;The Alamo&quot; (1960)
*&quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; (1954)
*&quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; (1946)
*&quot;Friendly Persuasion&quot; (1956)
*&quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; (1961)
*&quot;Lost Horizon&quot; (1937)

<text>This is a list of [[institution]]s related to the [[culture of Sweden]].

Swedish 20th-century culture is noted by pioneering works by the early days of cinema, with Mauritz Stiller and Victor Sjöström. Later, moguls like Ingmar Bergman and actresses such as Greta Garbo, Ingrid Bergman and Anita Ekberg made careers abroad. Swedish music is in many minds connected with ABBA, although more recently indie bands like The Soundtrack of Our Lives, The Hives, Sahara Hotnights and The (International) Noise Conspiracy have started achieving international fame. The Swedish hip hop scene is booming. Swedish literature is also vibrant and active, and Sweden ranks third in the list of countries with the most Nobel Prize laureates in literature.

<doc id="235907" wikidata="Q2160967" url="?curid=235907" title="Water extraction">
<text>Water extraction (also known as water withdrawal, water abstraction, and water intake) is the process of taking water from any source, either temporarily or permanently, for flood control or to obtain water for, for example, irrigation. The extracted water could also be used as drinking water after suitable treatment.

Depending on the environmental legislation in the country, controls may be placed on extraction to limit the amount of water that can be removed. The over-extraction of water can lead to dry rivers or declining groundwater levels.

The science of hydrogeology is used to determine safe water extraction levels. Water can go through dams that are used to regulate or stop water from coming though, creating hydroelectricity.

== Effects of overextraction ==

=== Saltwater intrusion ===
==== Groundwater Contamination ====
Groundwater contamination of water is seen vastly through the high needs of irrigation, drinking, and to support organic life. Keeping contaminants at a minimum is at a high demand and treated using arsenic, chloride and other chemicals to extract the pollutants. Humans can be a direct cause of these pollutants through over extraction. 

Certain leading causes for groundwater contamination comes from lowering water tables due to the over extraction of water and the water table not being able to recharge as quickly as needed. With this being said, polluted water from the surface (rivers and streams), makes its way into the groundwater more quickly and easily and results in a water quality problem due to the surface water pollution. 

Land Subsidence

Land Subsidence is another effect linked to the over extraction of groundwater. When large amounts of groundwater is extracted from aquifers beneath, surrounding areas above. When water from the aquifer is extracted at a large amount, the sediment, certain rock types, is separated due to the lack of water being used to make sure the sediment stays tightly together. The over extraction of groundwater is a human caused activity that causes these ground failures that create pore spaces where water once was occupying. The sudden sinking of the soils surface causes infrastructure damage and a higher risk of flood damage due to the displacement of the Earth&#x27;s surface. 

== Groundwater Extraction Laws ==

=== Public rights and laws established towards groundwater extraction ===
Groundwater laws contain the information revolving around the rights of water extraction and the withdrawals from aquifers in the United States that is measured. Most of the groundwater that is mainly withdrawn or extracted from aquifers consist of primarily irrigation towards the Southwest and the West with close to 85 to 90 withdrawn. 

With an expected increase of the demand of water for domestic usage in the future, systems are to be regulated and land rights vary on the consumption of groundwater rights. When requirements haven&#x27;t been met through the water extraction, States water resources control and take steps on authorization of the requirements for groups of individuals or corporations.

==Twin towns==
The contract of town-twinning with the city of Marbach am Neckar in Baden-Württemberg, Germany was established in 1990 and was among the first Sino-German town-twinnings, or sister city relationships. One lady citizen of Marbach am Neckar has been awarded honorary citizenship of Tongling City in 2005, recognizing her relentless effort to keep up the town-twinning. Marbach is the birthplace of the famous German poet Friedrich Schiller (1759–1805), as a symbol of friendship a statue was erected in local Tianjinhu-Lake-Park.

Tongling has been twinned with the Borough of Halton in England since 1997. A Chinese friendship garden was created in the grounds of Runcorn Town Hall in 2006, including a bronze statue gifted by the twin city of Tongling.

<text>Doggerel, or doggrel, is poetry that is irregular in rhythm and in rhyme, often deliberately for burlesque or comic effect. Alternatively, it can mean verse which has a monotonous rhythm, easy rhyme, and cheap or trivial meaning. 

The word is derived from the Middle English &quot;dogerel&quot;, probably a derivative of &quot;dog&quot;. In English, it has been used as an adjective since the 14th century and a noun since at least 1630.

Appearing since ancient times in the literatures of many cultures, doggerel is characteristic of nursery rhymes and children&#x27;s song.

==Examples==
The Scottish poet William McGonagall (1825–1902) has become famous for his doggerel, which many remember with affection despite its seeming technical flaws, as in his poem &quot;The Tay Bridge Disaster&quot;:
Hip hop lyrics have also explored the artful possibilities of doggerel.

Chaucer&#x27;s Tale of Sir Thopas is written in this format. It irritates the Host of The Tabard so much that he interrupts him and makes him tell a different tale.

<doc id="235914" wikidata="Q520487" url="?curid=235914" title="Gaius Julius Solinus">
<text>Gaius Julius Solinus, better known simply as Solinus, was a Latin grammarian, geographer, and compiler who probably flourished in the early 3rd century AD. Historical scholar Theodor Mommsen dates him to the middle of the 3rd century.

Solinus was the author of (&quot;On the Wonders of the World&quot;) which circulated under the titles (&quot;A Collection of Curious Things&quot;), , and , the latter title being favoured by the author himself. The work is indeed a description of curiosities in a chorographic framework. Adventus, to whom it is dedicated, is identified with Oclatinius Adventus, Roman consul in AD 218. It contains a short description of the ancient world, with remarks on historical, social, religious, and natural history questions. The greater part is taken from Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot; and the geography of Pomponius Mela.

According to Mommsen, Solinus also relied upon a chronicle (possibly by Cornelius Bocchus) and a , an epitome of Pliny&#x27;s work with additions made about the time of Hadrian. Schanz, however, suggests the &quot;Roma&quot; and &quot;Prata&quot; of Suetonius.

A greatly revised version of his original text was made, perhaps by Solinus himself. This version contains a letter that Solinus wrote as an introduction to the work, which gives the work the title . Both versions of the work circulated widely and eventually was taken for the author&#x27;s name. It was popular in the Middle Ages, hexameter abridgments being current under the names of Theodericus and Petrus Diaconus.

The commentary by Saumaise in his (1689) was considered indispensable; the 1895 edition by Mommsen includes a valuable introduction on the manuscripts, the authorities used by Solinus, and subsequent compilers. See also Teuffel, &quot;History of Roman Literature&quot; (English translation, 1900), 389; and Schanz, (1904), iv. I. There is an early modern English translation by Arthur Golding (1587) and a modern one with commentary by Dr. Arwen Apps of Macquarie University.

<text>Jada Koren Pinkett Smith (née Pinkett; born September 18, 1971) is an American actress, singer, talk show host, and businesswoman. She is co-host of the Facebook Watch talk show &quot;Red Table Talk&quot;, for which she has won a Daytime Emmy Award. &quot;Time&quot; named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2021.

Pinkett Smith landed her big break on the sitcom &quot;A Different World&quot; in 1991. She then starred in films such as &quot;Menace II Society&quot; (1993), &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot; (1996)&quot;,&quot; &quot;Set It Off&quot; (1996), and &quot;Scream 2&quot; (1997) before her prominent contributions to &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; (2003), &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; (2003), and the animated &quot;Madagascar&quot; films. She returned to television with starring roles on &quot;Hawthorne&quot; (2009–2011) and &quot;Gotham&quot; (2014–2017). Her other acting roles include &quot;Magic Mike XXL&quot; (2015), &quot;Bad Moms&quot; (2016), &quot;Girls Trip&quot; (2017), and &quot;The Matrix Resurrections&quot; (2021).

In 2002, Pinkett Smith began a musical career as the lead vocalist of the nu metal band, Wicked Wisdom. In 2005, she published a children&#x27;s book, &quot;Girls Hold Up This World&quot;, which landed at number two on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. With her husband Will Smith, she founded the company Westbrook in 2009, through which she has produced various media. In 2010, she earned a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Musical as a producer for the Broadway musical &quot;Fela!&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Born in Baltimore, Maryland, Jada Koren Pinkett was named after her mother&#x27;s favorite soap opera actress, Jada Rowland. She is of Jamaican and Bajan descent on her mother&#x27;s side and African-American descent on her father&#x27;s side. Her parents are Adrienne Banfield-Norris, the head nurse of a Baltimore inner-city clinic, and Robsol Pinkett Jr., who ran a construction company. Banfield-Norris became pregnant in high school, and the couple married but divorced after several months.

Pinkett&#x27;s mother was a heroin addict. Thus, Pinkett was raised by her mother and grandmother, Marion Martin Banfield, a Jamaican-born social worker who was married to Gilbert Banfield, a family medicine physician. &quot;My grandmother was a doer who wanted to create a better community and add beauty to the world,&quot; she said. Banfield noticed her granddaughter&#x27;s passion for the performing arts and enrolled her in piano, tap dance, and ballet lessons.

During elementary school, Pinkett got to know Josh Charles. She also participated in TWIGs (&quot;To Work In Gaining Skills&quot;), a free after-school program for 2nd-8th grade Baltimore City children offered by the Baltimore School for the Arts. The program is competitive; students must audition and only a few hundred are accepted each year. TWIGs is also often a stepping stone for additional arts training; about half of the entering class of Baltimore School for the Arts are TWIGs alumni.

Pinkett attended the Baltimore School for the Arts, where she studied acting and dance. While at BSA, she met and became close friends with classmate and rapper Tupac Shakur. She also reunited with her friend, Josh Charles. Pinkett graduated in 1989. Pinkett has admitted she was not the best student in high school, and frequently showed up late. Pinkett has remained an active alumnus of BSA.

She was raised in the Pimlico/Arlington neighborhood in a home on Price Avenue. Growing up, she hung out in the neighborhoods of Coldspring and Dolfield. As a teen, she went to clubs including Cignel, Odell&#x27;s Nightclub, and Godfrey&#x27;s Famous Ballroom. She has also publicly admitted selling drugs in the Cherry Hill neighborhood. After graduation from BSA, Pinkett spent a year at the North Carolina School of the Arts. She was a drama major.

==Film and television career==
===Early career (1990–1996)===
Pinkett began her acting career in 1990, when she starred in an episode of &quot;True Colors&quot;. She received guest roles in television shows such as &quot;Doogie Howser, M.D.&quot; (1991) and &quot;21 Jump Street&quot; (1991), and earned a role on comedian Bill Cosby&#x27;s NBC television sitcom &quot;A Different World&quot; in 1991, as college freshman Lena James.

The role on &quot;A Different World&quot; proved to be a pivotal career break. Pinkett joined the cast in its fourth season when it was already a hit show and stayed on the show until its final season. Like Pinkett, the character of Lena James was from a poor area of Baltimore. The character originally was a fish out of water; as a freshman she explained, &quot;I really miss my homeboys. They&#x27;re not like these Hillman brothers, all self-involved and afraid to sweat.&quot; The character of Lena James adapts and as a sophomore, when her Baltimore friends visit, she finds herself stuck between the world where she was raised and the world she was now in at Hillman. Lena James enters Hillman as an engineering major, but discovers her talent for writing and switches to journalism.

In 1993, Pinkett appeared in her first film, &quot;Menace II Society&quot;. A recommendation from her friend Tupac Shakur got her cast as single mother Ronnie. Shakur was also set to appear in the film before he was fired. Pinkett considered dropping out of the film after Shakur&#x27;s departure but he convinced her to keep the role.

In 1994, Pinkett acted with Keenen Ivory Wayans in the action and comedy film &quot;A Low Down Dirty Shame&quot;. She described her character Peaches as &quot;raw&quot; with &quot;major attitude&quot;, and her acting garnered positive reviews. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Ms. Pinkett, whose performance is as sassy and sizzling as a Salt-N-Pepa recording, walks away with the movie.&quot; In 1994, she also starred as a title character in Doug McHenry&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Jason&#x27;s Lyric&quot;, opposite Allen Payne. In his positive review of the film, Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;[Payne] has powerful chemistry with the enigmatic, teasing, tender character played by Pinkett; they really seem to like one another, which is not a feeling you always pick up in screen romances.&quot; That year, she also had a role in the romantic comedy-drama &quot;The Inkwell.&quot;

In 1995, Pinkett played a convict on work release in the horror film &quot;Demon Knight&quot;. According to Larenz Tate, Pinkett was set to appear in the film &quot;Dead Presidents&quot; (1995), but she turned down the role of Delilah due to her loyalty to Shakur. The Hughes brothers directed the film and they had fired Shakur from &quot;Menace II Society&quot;.

Pinkett also began directing music videos in 1995. She directed the music video &quot;I&#x27;m Going Down&quot; by girl group Y? N-Vee. She also directed the music video &quot;How Many Times&quot; by Gerald Levert and appeared in the video. &quot;It was reported that Pinkett would direct the music video for Shakur&#x27;s song &quot;Can U Get Away&quot; but another single was released instead. Pinkett came up with the concept for his &quot;California Love&quot; music video which she had intended to direct, but she removed herself from the project. In 1996, Pinkett directed the music video &quot;Keep On, Keepin&#x27; On&quot; by MC Lyte Feat. Xscape.

===Rise to prominence (1996–2002)===
Pinkett starred with actor and comedian Eddie Murphy in the 1996 remake of &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot;, portraying the love interest of a morbidly-obese, kindhearted university professor. The film was a commercial success, earning $25 million in its first weekend in North America and eventually $274 million worldwide. She also had a lead role in &quot;Set It Off&quot; (1996), a crime drama about four women who rob banks to escape from poverty, opposite Queen Latifah, Vivica A. Fox, and Kimberly Elise. Her acting in the film was noted in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, which wrote that she was &quot;the one to watch&quot;. Budgeted at $9 million, &quot;Set It Off&quot; made $41 million globally.

In 1997, Pinkett had a cameo role in &quot;Scream 2&quot; as a college student who is brutally murdered in front of hundreds of filmgoers. The film made more than $100 million at the North American box office. In 1998, she played a news reporter in the thriller &quot;Return to Paradise&quot;, with Joaquin Phoenix and Vince Vaughn, and took on the title role of an extroverted woman, alongside Tommy Davidson, in the comedy &quot;Woo&quot;. While favorably reviewing her performance in &quot;Woo&quot;, Derek Armstrong of &quot;AllMovie&quot; wrote that the script was &quot;formulaic&quot; and &quot;not much of a vehicle for its impish starlet&quot;. She next starred in Spike Lee&#x27;s film &quot;Bamboozled&quot; (2000) as a personal assistant to the main character, played by Damon Wayans. Although the film met with mediocre reviews, it won the National Board of Review&#x27;s Freedom of Expression Award.

In 2001, Pinkett Smith portrayed a loud-mouthed wife in the moderately successful comedy &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, with LL Cool J, Vivica A. Fox, Anthony Anderson, Toni Braxton, and Whoopi Goldberg. In the biographical sports drama &quot;Ali&quot; (2001), she played Sonji Roi, the first wife of boxer Muhammad Ali, opposite Will Smith. While she loved the final product, she initially did not think she was the right person for the role: &quot;I felt like because we were a couple off screen, for people to see us together on the screen in a movie like this, would take people out of the movie, that people would see Will and Jada there—they wouldn&#x27;t see Ali and Sonji&quot;.

=== Commercial success (2003–2017) ===
Perhaps her best-known role to date is the part of human rebel Niobe in the films &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; (2003) and &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; (2003), sequels to 1999&#x27;s &quot;The Matrix&quot;, and the related video game &quot;Enter The Matrix&quot; (2003). The character was written specifically with Pinkett Smith in mind. Directly after she filmed her scenes for &quot;Ali&quot;, Pinkett Smith flew to Australia to work on the &quot;Matrix&quot; sequels. The sequels earned over $91 million and $48 million during their North American opening weekends, respectively.

In the neonoir thriller &quot;Collateral&quot; (2004), alongside Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise, Pinkett Smith played a U.S. Justice Department prosecutor and the target of a contract killer. The film was a critical and commercial success, grossing $217.8 million worldwide. She voiced Gloria, a strong, confident, but sweet hippopotamus, in the animated film &quot;Madagascar&quot; (2005). Tom McGrath, one of the film&#x27;s directors, said they found all these traits in her voice when they listened to her. Despite a mixed response from critics, the film was a commercial success, earning $532 million worldwide, and becoming one of the biggest hits of 2005. In 2007, she played the wife of an affluent dentist in the drama &quot;Reign Over Me&quot;, with Adam Sandler, Don Cheadle, Liv Tyler, and Donald Sutherland. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called the film a &quot;strange, black-and-blue therapeutic drama equally mottled with likable good intentions and agitating clumsiness&quot;, and found Pinkett Smith &quot;graceful&quot; in it.

In 2008, Pinkett Smith took on the role of a lesbian author in the all-female comedy &quot;The Women&quot;, opposite Meg Ryan, Annette Bening, Debra Messing, and Eva Mendes. Though a commercial success, &quot;The Women&quot; was panned by critics, with Pinkett Smith earning a nomination for the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress for her performance. Her directorial debut was the drama &quot;The Human Contract&quot; (also 2008); she also wrote it, and starred as the sister of a successful but unhappy businessman, with Paz Vega and Idris Elba. It debuted at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2008. The success of &quot;Madagascar&quot; led Pinkett Smith to return to the role of Gloria in the 2008 sequel &quot;&quot;, which earned US$603 million at the international box office.

Pinkett Smith was an executive producer and starred as a Chief Nursing Officer in the TNT medical drama &quot;Hawthorne&quot;, which premiered on June 16, 2009. &quot;USA Today&quot; remarked: &quot;Pinkett Smith&#x27;s &quot;Hawthorne&quot; is tired in every sense of the word, and she&#x27;s not the only one. Every character and event falls under the category of painfully predictable&quot;. &quot;Hawthorne&quot; ended on August 16, 2011, after three seasons. In 2010, she earned a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Musical as a producer for the Broadway musical &quot;Fela!&quot;. While she reprised the voice role of Gloria in &quot;Madagascar 3: Europe&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; (2012), which made over US$746 million, she also voiced the character in the NBC Christmas special &quot;Merry Madagascar&quot; (2009) and the direct-to-DVD film &quot;Madly Madagascar&quot; (2013).

Beginning in 2014, Pinkett Smith starred in the first season of the FOX crime drama &quot;Gotham&quot;, as Gotham City gangster Fish Mooney. She returned, recurrently, in the second and third seasons of the series. In 2015, she starred in the comedy &quot;Magic Mike XXL&quot;, as the manager of a star stripper club, opposite Channing Tatum and Joe Manganiello. The film made US$122.5 million worldwide. She starred with Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell and Christina Applegate in the comedy &quot;Bad Moms&quot; (2016), as the sidekick of a domineering parent-teacher association head. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the cast and humor, though did not feel it could &quot;take full advantage of its assets&quot;. The film, nevertheless, earned more than US$183.9 million.

Pinkett Smith next took on the role of a nurse and uptight mom in the comedy &quot;Girls Trip&quot; (2017), alongside Regina Hall, Queen Latifah, and Tiffany Haddish. The film was chosen by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of its top ten films of 2017, and grossed US$140 million worldwide, including over US$100 million domestically, the first comedy of 2017 to do so. In July 2017, Pinkett Smith appeared at the Essence Festival where, on the Empowerment Stage, she appeared to talk alongside Queen Latifah. Pinkett Smith spoke highly of the cast reflecting their characters in real life, stating that they are all women who love other women and work to empower each other, a feature that she notes as rare in Hollywood.

=== Later career (2018–present) ===
Beginning in May 2018, Pinkett Smith along with her mother Adrienne Banfield-Norris and her daughter Willow Smith have hosted the Facebook Watch talk show &quot;Red Table Talk&quot;, which focuses on a wide range of topics. In a positive review, &quot;USA Today&quot;″s Maeve McDermott praised the series for its &quot;insightful guests, no-holds-barred topics and Smith&#x27;s magnetic hosting presence&quot;. In 2021, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named Pinkett Smith and her co-hosts to its list of the 100 most influential people in the world; they were chosen by comedian Tiffany Haddish. In 2021, Red Table Talk won a Daytime Emmy Award in the outstanding informative talk show category.

Pinkett Smith narrated and produced the 2023 docu-series &quot;African Queens&quot;, which premiered on Netflix. The first season focused on Njinga, Queen of Ndongo and Matamba while the second season focused on Ptolemaic Egyptian Queen Cleopatra VII. Pinkett Smith&#x27;s memoir &quot;Worthy&quot; was published in October 2023. The book covers her journey from suicidal depression to self-acceptance and spiritual healing. It also offers insight to her difficult childhood, friendship with rapper Tupac Shakur, unconventional marriage, and her reaction to Will Smith slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars.

==Musical career==
Under the name Jada Koren, Pinkett Smith formed the metal band Wicked Wisdom in 2002. The band consists of Pinkett Smith performing lead vocals, Pocket Honore (guitar, vocals), Cameron &quot;Wirm&quot; Graves (guitar, keyboard, vocals), and Rio (bass, vocals). The band is managed by James Lassiter and Miguel Melendez of Overbrook Entertainment, a company co-founded by Pinkett Smith&#x27;s husband Will Smith.

The band&#x27;s self-titled debut album was released on February 21, 2006, by Pinkett Smith&#x27;s production company 100% Womon and Suburban Noize Records. Will Smith served as the project&#x27;s executive producer. The album made it to &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top Heatseekers chart, and peaked at number 44 during the week of March 11, 2006. AllMusic reviewer Alex Henderson said of the album, &quot;[Pinkett Smith] shows herself to be an expressive, commanding singer&quot; and that &quot;[Wicked Wisdom] shows considerable promise&quot;. The band promoted the album in 2006, touring with heavy metal band Sevendust.

===Onyx Hotel Tour===
Wicked Wisdom landed a slot on Britney Spears&#x27; Onyx Hotel Tour in 2004, one of the year&#x27;s highest-profile tours. The band opened for Spears for eight dates in April and May 2004, during the European leg of the tour.

===Ozzfest 2005===
In 2005, Sharon Osbourne saw Wicked Wisdom perform at a small nightclub in Los Angeles. She said: &quot;I was blown away. When you see and hear Jada with her band it&#x27;s apparent that she has nothing but love and respect for this genre of music&quot;. In May 2005, organizers announced Wicked Wisdom would perform on the second stage of 2005&#x27;s Ozzfest. Aware of questions about the band&#x27;s addition to Ozzfest, Pinkett Smith said, &quot;I&#x27;m not here asking for any favors. You&#x27;ve got to show and prove. And not every audience is going to go for it.&quot; Wicked Wisdom&#x27;s guitarist Pocket Honore said while early dates of the tour were rocky, &quot;once word got out that we weren&#x27;t a joke, people started coming out and by the sixth or seventh gig we were on fire&quot;. Pinkett Smith agreed, saying, &quot;After seven dates within the Ozzfest tour, the whole attitude of it started to turn around once the word of mouth started getting out.&quot;

==Other ventures==
===Business===
After opening her music company 100% Women Productions, Pinkett Smith created her own fashion label, Maja, in 1994. The clothing line features women&#x27;s T-shirts and dresses embellished with the slogan &quot;Sister Power&quot;, sold primarily through small catalogs. In 2003, Pinkett Smith and Smith helped to create the television series &quot;All of Us&quot;, which aired on UPN/The CW. Pinkett Smith published her first children&#x27;s book, &quot;Girls Hold Up This World&quot;, in 2005. &quot;I wrote the book for Willow and for her friends and for all the little girls in the world who need affirmation about being female in this pretty much masculine world. I really tried to capture different sides of femininity. I want girls in the world to feel powerful, to know they have the power to change the world in any way they wish.&quot;

In 2005, Pinkett Smith became one of many celebrities to invest a combined total of US$10 million in Carol&#x27;s Daughter, a line of beauty products created by Lisa Price. She became a spokesman for the beauty line, and said, &quot;To be a part of another African American woman&#x27;s dream was just priceless to me.&quot; In 2015, the Smith couple were among the founding investors of an energy storage company. Pinkett-Smith produces films through jointly owned production companies with husband Will Smith under Overbrook Entertainment and Westbrook Inc. In 2019, Westbrook Entertainment was acquired by Mark Gillespie&#x27;s Three Six Zero, diversifying that talent management company.

===Philanthropy===
In 1997, Pinkett Smith was the emcee of the Million Woman March in Philadelphia. Together with Will, Pinkett Smith has created the Will and Jada Smith Family Foundation in Baltimore, Maryland, a charity that focuses on youth in urban inner cities and family support. Her aunt, Karen Banfield Evans, is the foundation&#x27;s executive director. The charity was awarded the David Angell Humanitarian Award by The American Screenwriters Association (ASA) in 2006. The Will and Jada Smith Family Foundation has provided grants to non-profit organizations such as YouthBuild, and Pinkett Smith has made personal donations to organizations such as Capital K-9s.

After meeting Tom Cruise during the filming of &quot;Collateral&quot; (2004), Pinkett Smith and Will Smith donated $20,000 to the Hollywood Education and Literacy Program (HELP), Scientology&#x27;s basis for homeschooling. Pinkett Smith reported using Scientology&#x27;s Study Technology to homeschool her children, and she credited Scientology&#x27;s Narconon with helping her father with his addiction. In 2006, Pinkett Smith donated $1 million to her high school alma mater, the Baltimore School for the Arts, and dedicated the new theater to her classmate and close friend Tupac Shakur.

When Pinkett Smith&#x27;s aunt, Karen Banfield Evans, was diagnosed with lupus, the Will and Jada Smith Family Foundation, in association with the Lupus Foundation of America and Maybelline, held the first annual &quot;Butterflies Over Hollywood&quot; event on September 29, 2007, at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles. The event raised funds for LFA public and professional educational programs. The Will and Jada Smith Family Foundation was presented with an award in 2007 at the 4th Annual Lupus Foundation of America Awards.

In 2012, on behalf of PETA, Pinkett Smith wrote a letter to Baltimore&#x27;s mayor, asking that the visiting Ringling Brothers Circus &quot;comply with Baltimore&#x27;s absolute prohibition of the use of devices such as bullhooks&quot; and not harm the elephants. In 2013, she appeared in a video clip for Gucci&#x27;s &quot;Chime for Change&quot; campaign that aims to raise funds and awareness of women&#x27;s issues globally.

==Personal life==

In the early 1990s, Pinkett Smith dated former basketball player Grant Hill while he attended Duke University. Pinkett Smith had a close friendship with rapper Tupac Shakur which was formed when they were attending the Baltimore School for the Arts. Pinkett Smith secured Shakur a guest appearance on &quot;A Different World&quot; in 1993. She appeared in his music videos &quot;Keep Ya Head Up&quot; (1993) and &quot;Temptations&quot; (1995). She also came up with the concept for his &quot;California Love&quot; (1995) music video and had intended to direct it, but she removed herself from the project. In 1995, she contributed $100,000 towards Shakur&#x27;s bail as he awaited an appeal on his sexual abuse conviction. She later revealed that she turned down a marriage proposal from Shakur while he was incarcerated at Rikers Island in 1995. Speaking about her, Shakur stated: &quot;Jada is my heart. She will be my friend for my whole life. We&#x27;ll be old together. Jada can ask me to do anything and she can have it.&quot; Pinkett Smith stated in the 2003 documentary &quot;&quot; that Shakur was &quot;one of my best friends. He was like a brother. It was beyond friendship for us. The type of relationship we had, you only get that once in a lifetime.&quot;

In 2018, Pinkett Smith revealed that she had been diagnosed with the autoimmune disease alopecia areata. Despite having many medical tests, she said she has not been able to find the cause of her alopecia, and that she suspects it might be stress. She shared a video on her Instagram account in December 2021 showing herself with a shaved head, saying: &quot;Now at this point, I can only laugh&quot; (...) &quot;Mama&#x27;s gonna have to take it down to the scalp so nobody thinks she got brain surgery or something. Me and this alopecia are going to be friends... period!&quot;. A joke by Chris Rock at the 94th Academy Awards referring to Pinkett-Smith&#x27;s hair resulted in Will Smith angrily slapping Rock in retaliation.

Pinkett Smith speaks Spanish.

===Family===
Pinkett Smith has remained close to her mother Adrienne Banfield-Norris, and said, &quot;A mother and daughter&#x27;s relationship is usually the most honest, and we are so close.&quot; She also added: &quot;[My mother] understood what I wanted and never stood in my way.&quot; She participated as the maid of honor in Banfield-Norris&#x27;s 1998 wedding to Paul Jones, a telecommunications executive.

She met Will Smith in 1994 on the set of Smith&#x27;s television show &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;, when she auditioned for the role of his character&#x27;s girlfriend, Lisa Wilkes. She was considered too short and the role went to actress Nia Long. Will and Jada later began dating after his divorce from Sheree Fletcher was finalized in 1995. Prior to this, Will had developed an attraction to Jada, but did not act on it. Jada eventually moved from her hometown of Baltimore to California to be with him. On December 31, 1997, while Jada was three months pregnant, about 100 guests attended their wedding at The Cloisters, near her hometown of Baltimore, Maryland. Regarding her marriage, Jada said that they are &quot;private people&quot; and told one interviewer, &quot;I will throw my career away before I let it break up our marriage. I made it clear to Will. I&#x27;d throw it away completely&quot;. She later revealed that she &quot;never wanted to be married,&quot; but as a young and pregnant actress she felt pressured and her mother urged her to get married.

They have two children, Jaden Christopher Syre Smith (born 1998), and Willow Camille Reign Smith (born 2000). She is also the stepmother of Trey Smith, her husband&#x27;s son from a previous marriage. Will commented in 2008 on their parenting styles: &quot;We&#x27;re not strict but we definitely believe it&#x27;s a very important component for rearing children. It creates safety for them. They understand that they need guidance.&quot; The family resides in a home, on , in Malibu. In May 2014, Moisés Arias, who was 20 at the time, was photographed shirtless in a bed with then-13-year-old Willow Smith. The photo triggered an investigation into the family by the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services.

In April 2013, Pinkett Smith caused many to believe she and her husband were in an open marriage after stating in an interview: &quot;I&#x27;ve always told Will, &#x27;You can do whatever you want as long as you can look at yourself in the mirror and be okay&#x27;. Because at the end of the day, Will is his own man. I&#x27;m here as his partner, but he is his own man&quot;. However, she denied such, clarifying her statements on Facebook, writing: &quot;Open marriage? The statement I made in regard to, &#x27;Will can do whatever he wants&#x27;, has illuminated the need to discuss the relationship between trust and love and how they co-exist&quot;.

In June 2020, singer and rapper August Alsina—a friend of Pinkett Smith&#x27;s son Jaden—said that he and Pinkett Smith had been involved in an adulterous affair in 2016, when he was 23 years old and she was 44. He also claimed that the affair happened with Will Smith&#x27;s permission. A spokesman for Pinkett Smith denied the claims, saying they were &quot;absolutely not true&quot;. On July 10, during an episode of &quot;Red Table Talk&quot; featuring her husband, Pinkett Smith confirmed an &quot;entanglement&quot; with Alsina during their separation, although not with his permission. Pinkett Smith said that Alsina misconstrued it as permission because she and her husband were &quot;separated amicably&quot;. She eventually got back together with her husband after breaking off the relationship with Alsina and stated she has not spoken to him since.
Pinkett Smith&#x27;s use of the word &quot;entanglement&quot; went viral on the Internet. In 2021, Will Smith stated that Pinkett Smith &quot;never believed in conventional marriage&quot; and that both of them have had sexual relationships outside of their marriage. In October 2023, Pinkett Smith stated that she and Smith had been separated since 2016, though they have no intention to divorce.

===Sexuality===
In her 2023 memoir &quot;Worthy&quot;, Pinkett noted that &quot;there have always been rumors&quot; that she is gay, though she attributes them to having been seen dancing at LGBTQ+ clubs in Los Angeles in the 1990s. She does not deny, however, having experimented with intimacy with women, stating, &quot;The truth is that during those early years of exploration in Hollywood, I had a few sexual experiences with women, only to realize that when it comes to sex, I love men...my belief is--women are the most amazing creatures on the planet, and I hold reverence for women through my friendships.&quot;

<text>Dr. Henry Jekyll and his alter ego, Mr. Edward Hyde, is the central character of Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s 1886 novella &quot;Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot;. In the story, he is a good friend of main protagonist Gabriel John Utterson. 

Living in Soho in the West End of London, Jekyll is a kind and respected English doctor struggling with repressed evil urges. As a potential solution, he develops a serum that he believes will effectively compartmentalize his dark side. Instead, Jekyll transforms into Edward Hyde, the physical and mental manifestation of his evil personality. This process happens more regularly until Jekyll becomes unable to control when the transformations occur. Dr. Jekyll roams Soho as Mr. Hyde, and Mr. Hyde inhabits Leicester Square as both himself and Dr. Jekyll.

==Fictional character biography==
Dr. Henry Jekyll, M.D., D.L.C., LL.D., F.R.S., &amp;c. is a doctor based in Soho who feels that he is battling between the benevolence and malevolence within himself. He spends his life trying to repress evil urges that are not fitting for a man of his stature. Jekyll develops a potion in an attempt to mask this hidden evil. However, in doing so, Jekyll transforms into a hideous creature, which appears much younger than him. Jekyll decides to take advantage of this, naming this transformation of his &quot;Edward Hyde&quot;, and uses his new persona to act out his hidden desires free of consequences while keeping his social status as Jekyll. As time goes by, Hyde grows in power and eventually manifests whenever Henry Jekyll shows signs of physical or moral weakness, no longer needing the potion to transform.

Stevenson never says exactly what Hyde does, generally saying that it is something of an evil and lustful nature. Thus, in the context of the times, it is abhorrent to Victorian religious morality, potentially including engaging with prostitutes or buggery. However, it is Hyde&#x27;s violent activities that seem to give him the most thrills, driving him to attack and murder Sir Danvers Carew without apparent reason, making him a hunted outlaw throughout England. Carew was a client of Gabriel Utterson, Jekyll&#x27;s lawyer and friend, who is concerned by Hyde&#x27;s history of violence and the fact that Jekyll changed his will, leaving everything to Hyde. Dr. Hastie Lanyon, a mutual acquaintance of Jekyll and Utterson, dies of shock after receiving information relating to Jekyll. Before his death, Lanyon gives Utterson a letter to be opened after Jekyll&#x27;s death or disappearance.

When Jekyll refuses to leave his lab for weeks, Utterson and Jekyll&#x27;s butler Mr. Poole break into the lab. Inside, they find the body of Hyde wearing Jekyll&#x27;s clothes and apparently dead from suicide. They find also a letter from Jekyll to Utterson promising to explain the entire mystery. Utterson takes the document home where he first reads Lanyon&#x27;s letter and then Jekyll&#x27;s.

The first reveals that Lanyon&#x27;s deterioration and eventual death resulted from seeing Hyde drinking a serum or potion and subsequently turning into Jekyll. The second letter explains that Jekyll, having previously indulged unstated vices (and with it the fear that discovery would lead to his losing his social position), found a way to transform himself and thereby indulge his vices without fear of detection. But as Jekyll used Hyde to act out his desires more and more, he effectively became a sociopath — evil, violent, self-indulgent, and utterly uncaring to anyone but himself. Initially, Jekyll was able to control the transformations, but later, he became Hyde involuntarily in his sleep.

At this point, Jekyll resolved to cease becoming Hyde. One night however, the urge gripped him too strongly. After the transformation, he immediately rushed out and violently killed Carew. Horrified, Jekyll tried more adamantly to stop the transformations, as now his scapegoat was no longer safe. For a time, he proved successful by engaging in philanthropic work. One day at a park, he considered how good a person he had become as a result of his deeds (in comparison to others), believing himself redeemed. However, before he completed his line of thought, he looked down at his hands and realized that he had suddenly transformed once again into Hyde. This was the first time that an involuntary metamorphosis had happened in waking hours.

Far from his laboratory and hunted by the police as a murderer, Hyde needed help to avoid being caught. He wrote to Lanyon (in Jekyll&#x27;s hand) asking his friend to retrieve the contents of a cabinet in his laboratory and to meet him at midnight at Lanyon&#x27;s home in Cavendish Square. In Lanyon&#x27;s presence, Hyde mixed the potion and transformed back to Jekyll - ultimately leading to Lanyon&#x27;s death. Meanwhile, Jekyll returned to his home only to find himself ever more helpless and trapped as the transformations increased in frequency and necessitated even larger doses of potion in order to reverse them.

Eventually, the stock of ingredients from which Jekyll had been preparing the potion ran low, and subsequent batches prepared by Dr. Jekyll from renewed stocks failed to produce the transformation. Jekyll speculated that the one essential ingredient that made the original potion work (a chemical salt) must have itself been contaminated. After sending Poole to one chemist after another to purchase the salt that was running low only to find it would not work, he assumed that subsequent supplies all lacked the essential ingredient that made the potion successful for his experiments. His ability to change back from Hyde into Jekyll had slowly vanished in consequence. Jekyll wrote that even as he composed his letter, he knew that he would soon become Hyde permanently, having used the last of this salt and he wondered if Hyde would face execution for his crimes or choose to kill himself. Jekyll noted that in either case, the end of his letter marked the end of his life. He ended the letter saying &quot;I bring the life of that unhappy Henry Jekyll to an end&quot;. With these words, both the document and the novella come to a close.

The original pronunciation of &quot;Jekyll&quot;, as used in Stevenson&#x27;s native Scotland, rhymed with &quot;treacle&quot;, thus ().

* Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde appear in &quot;Climax!&quot; episode &quot;The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;. Hosted by Bill Lundigan, this episode was originally aired on 28 July 1955 (Season 1 Episode 34). The story was adapted for television by Gore Vidal.
* Loosely based on Stevenson&#x27;s novel, the first season episode of &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;, &quot;The Enemy Within&quot;, Captain Kirk is split into two people: one evil and one good.
* The &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where are You!&quot; episode &quot;Nowhere to Hyde&quot; features the Ghost of Mr. Hyde (voiced by John Stephenson) who is committing jewelry store robberies and one of the suspects is a descendant of Dr. Jekyll.
* In the &quot;Dynomutt, Dog Wonder&quot; episode &quot;Everyone Hyde!&quot;, the criminal Willie the Weasel (voiced by Henry Corden) creates a similar formula (which is related to Dr. Jekyll&#x27;s formula) that turns him into Mr. Hyde.
* The grandson of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is featured in &quot;The Comic Strip&quot; segment &quot;The Mini Monsters&quot; voiced by Bob McFadden. He works as the camp physician at Camp Mini-Mon.

Dr. Jekyll considers Mr. Hyde to be his &quot;partner&quot;
* In the &quot;Gravedale High&quot; episode &quot;Fear of Flying&quot;, there is a medical version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (voiced by Frank Welker) that works as a doctor for Gravedale&#x27;s monster community.

* The 2007 TV serial &quot;Jekyll&quot; starred James Nesbitt as Tom Jackman, a modern Jekyll whose Hyde persona wreaks havoc in modern London. In the course of the series, it is revealed that the original Jekyll&#x27;s transformation into Hyde was a &#x27;natural&#x27; process, triggered by Jekyll&#x27;s love for his maid rather than any kind of potion, and Jackman is the descendant of one of Hyde&#x27;s bastard sons, while his wife is a clone of Jekyll&#x27;s maid created by a corporation to try and duplicate the Hyde process. As with most modern adaptations, Hyde is depicted as possessing superhuman strength, able to tear a lion apart with his bare hands, and is depicted as being impulsive and childish rather than explicitly &quot;evil&quot;, although the physical changes are fairly subtle, such as Hyde having darker eyes and a different hairstyle. At the series&#x27; conclusion, Hyde apparently sacrifices himself to save Jackman, &quot;dying&quot; when he is shot but somehow able to stop Jackman &quot;sharing the damage&quot;, with the result that the bullets remain in Jackman but he has no injuries to demonstrate where they entered his body.

Also, Jason suffers from dissociative identity disorder instead of developing a serum that separates the good and evil in a person.
* The &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; episode &quot;The Monster of Phineas-n-Ferbenstein&quot; features the villain Dr. Jekyll Doofenshmirtz drinking a potion to turn himself into a monster.

* SBS&#x27;s &quot;Hyde Jekyll, Me&quot; portrays a man, Goo Seo Jin, who is in line as a successor of the conglomerate group his family owns but has dissociative identity disorder. His other personality, Robin, is the opposite of his usual cold, cynical self; Robin is kind, gentle and has a savior complex.
* Shazad Latif portrays an Anglo-Indian Dr. Henry Jekyll on the third season of &quot;Penny Dreadful&quot;. In the show, Jekyll is the illegitimate child of an English nobleman and an Indian woman. His father abandoned Jekyll and his mother in India, and after Jekyll&#x27;s mother dies from leprosy, he goes to the University of Cambridge, where he befriends Victor Frankenstein but is ultimately expelled from Cambridge after getting into a fight with a professor due to the professor&#x27;s racist comments. He then works at Bedlam Hospital, developing a serum to pacify patients and bring out a calm, tame nature. In the last episode of the show, Jekyll&#x27;s father dies and he inherits his title: Lord Hyde.

* The 2015 TV series &quot;Jekyll &amp; Hyde&quot; focuses on the illegitimate grandson of Henry Jekyll named Doctor Robert Jekyll who has inherited his grandfather&#x27;s Hyde personality. While Robert is initially able to control his transformation with pills, as the series unfolds, he learns about various demonic threats to the world, and is forced to harness the superhuman strength he possesses as Hyde to oppose these forces. In the course of the series, Robert Jekyll works with Henry Jekyll&#x27;s old assistant and even meets Henry Jekyll&#x27;s lover (and hence his grandmother), although his Hyde persona never gains a first name.
* Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde appear in &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;, with Dr. Jekyll portrayed by Hank Harris and Mr. Hyde portrayed by Sam Witwer. They first appear in the season five finale episodes &quot;Only You&quot; and &quot;An Untold Story&quot;. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are shown as inhabitants of the Land of Untold Stories, who follow the heroes to Storybrooke while emigrating the inhabitants of the Land of Untold Stories to Storybrooke as well. They originally came from the Victorian England world until Dr. Jekyll accidentally killed their love interest. In season six, Mr. Hyde strikes up an allegiance with Regina Mills&#x27; Evil Queen side. It&#x27;s revealed that Jekyll&#x27;s serum failed to remove his capacity for evil and he is killed by Captain Hook which causes Hyde to die as well as a side effect of the serum.
* Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde appear in &quot;Mary Shelley&#x27;s Frankenhole&quot;, as a minor character who only appears in a few episodes. In the show, he is depicted as a pharmacist in the village that Victor Frankenstein&#x27;s castle overlooks. He constantly seeks the approval Frankenstein, who views Jekyll as nothing more than an annoyance. Jekyll rarely transforms into Mr. Hyde, though when he does, Hyde usually will only make stereotypical sexist comments towards female characters. Like the novel, Jekyll does not need the serum to transform into Hyde, as in one episode, Victor manages to get Jekyll to turn into Hyde by mocking him.
* The TV series &quot;Wednesday&quot; features a race of creatures called Hydes who are mutated outcasts. It would take a traumatic event or a hypnosis from someone to cause a person&#x27;s Hyde form to emerge. In addition, Uncle Fester is shown to have a knowledge on the Hydes. Tyler Galpin (portrayed by Hunter Doohan in human form and motion-captured by Daniel Himschoot) and his late mother Francoise are known Hydes.

His mole in the League, Dorian Gray, manages to acquire a sample of the Hyde serum, which he is able to duplicate, one of Moriarty&#x27;s men drinking a massive overdose of the Hyde serum to become an even larger version of Hyde. Despite the other Hyde&#x27;s size and raw power, he is defeated when he burns through the formula at an accelerated rate, resulting in Moriarty&#x27;s fortress collapsing on top of him.
* Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde appear in &quot;Van Helsing&quot;, with Dr. Jekyll portrayed by Stephen Fisher while Robbie Coltrane provides the voice of the animated Mr. Hyde. Like the version that was seen in &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;, Mr. Hyde is also portrayed as a large, hulking brute. Van Helsing has pursued Hyde to Paris after having failed to capture him in an earlier confrontation in London, England. He is superhumanly strong and displays agility comparable to that of a great ape. While not invulnerable, he is extremely tough and sustains severe injuries that ultimately do little to impede or slow him down to any appreciable degree. Upon exchanging banter, they begin fighting in the bell tower of Notre Dame Cathedral with Van Helsing initially gaining the advantage by severing Hyde&#x27;s left arm at the biceps, which regresses to a normal form after landing on the floor. Hyde rallies and assaults Van Helsing, using his right arm to hurl him through the roof of the cathedral. He then gloats before tossing Van Helsing off the roof only for Van Helsing to fire a grappling gun that sends the hook &amp; line through the center of Hyde&#x27;s body, which Van Helsing uses to stop his fall. He attempts to pull Hyde off the roof, only for Hyde to begin pulling him upward, seemingly unfazed by the large hole in his body. Hyde trips over the edge of the roof, his falling weight pulling Van Helsing up to the roof before the line breaks. As it breaks, the momentum swings Hyde through the Rose Window of the cathedral and, while he falls, Hyde transforms back into the form of Henry Jekyll and dies from the fall. A police officer spots Van Helsing on top of the cathedral and holds him accountable for Dr. Jekyll&#x27;s death.
** Jekyll and Hyde appear in an animated midquel, &quot;Van Helsing: The London Assignment&quot;, Coltrane reprises the voice of Hyde, while Jekyll is voiced by Dwight Schultz.
** The novelization of the film portrays Hyde as not only a murderer, but a cannibal as well. The novel says the body of the murdered woman Van Helsing discovers on the streets of Paris as partially devoured while the same scene in the film shows the woman&#x27;s body intact. However, the film does suggest that Hyde is cannibalistic when he encounters Van Helsing in Notre Dame and tells him &quot;You&#x27;re a big one. You&#x27;ll be hard to digest.&quot; In the Game Version, Hyde tells Van Helsing that he is responsible for the murders and digestion of several people including children.
* The Ghost of Mr. Hyde made a cameo in &quot;Scooby-Doo! and the Goblin King&quot; as a patron in a monster bar.
* The Dynomutt version of Mr. Hyde appeared in &quot;Scooby-Doo! Mask of the Blue Falcon&quot;, voiced by John DiMaggio.
* Russell Crowe played Dr. Jekyll in &quot;The Mummy&quot;, which is the first and only installment in Universal&#x27;s Dark Universe and is a role which would have been elaborated on in further films within the series. It is suggested that Jekyll&#x27;s transformation into Hyde was a &quot;natural&quot; condition, as he reflects on how someone- implied to be him- realized that he was succumbing to evil but was able to find a cure as a physician, requiring regular injections of an unspecified compound to prevent himself becoming Hyde, an aggressive and sadistic persona. Despite the personality transformation, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde have the same appearance with the exception of their skin and eyes, although they also have a different palm print with the result that palm scanners that will allow Jekyll access will prohibit Hyde from using the same door. As Hyde, he exhibits greater levels of physical strength, endurance and aggression as well as improved combat abilities.
* Henry Jekyll, better known as Edward &quot;Eddy&quot; Hyde, was mentioned many times in the 2022 live action film on Monster High. After he was expelled from Monster High because of his human half, Eddie Hyde worked on a formula to make him more monstrous. Unfortunately, he never got around to using it due to the fact that he was killed by the monster hunters. Eddy Hyde was revealed to have a son named Edward &quot;Eddy&quot; Hyde Jr. who went under the alias Mr. Komos and sought out his father&#x27;s work.

This incarnation of Jekyll and Hyde reveals that eventually Jekyll found that he would transform into Hyde under stress, not unlike Hulk. Likewise, Hyde has become progressively taller and bulkier than Jekyll, while Jekyll has become shorter and withered. During a dinner scene, Hyde explains that this is because splitting himself and Jekyll into separate identities resulted in him losing his restraints and growing beyond his original limits, while Jekyll withered away without anything to drive him. During the Martian invasion, he developed a strong respect for Mina Murray and sacrificed himself to stop Martian tripods from crossing London Bridge. His self-sacrifice was honored in having Serpentine Park named into Hyde Park and a statue of Mr. Hyde is seen in the park in &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier&quot; and throughout &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume III: Century&quot;.

* In &quot;Monster High&quot;, there are characters named Jackson Jekyll and Holt Hyde who are the descendants of Dr. Jekyll. They are voiced by Cindy Robinson in the webisodes and TV specials.
* In &quot;Servamp&quot;, a manga written and illustrated by Strike Tanaka, there are two characters known as Licht Jekylland Todoroki and Lawless of Greed (later given the name of Hyde by the former). They have no direct correlation with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in personality traits from the original novel, but their names, as well as their roles as opposites to each other (Licht as an Angel and Hyde as a Demon) nod to the original story. Their combined special attack is titled &quot;Jekyll and Hyde&quot;.
* In &quot;Fate/Grand Order&quot;, a mobile video game based on the &quot;Fate/stay night&quot; visual novel and franchise from Type-Moon, a Servant under the classes Assassin and Berserker appears, named &quot;Henry Jekyll &amp; Hyde.&quot; In most of his appearance during battle sequences, he is the Assassin-class Servant Henry Jekyll, however when using his Noble Phantasm, or special ability, he becomes the Berserker-class Servant Hyde.
* In the BBC radio sketch show &quot;John Finnemore&#x27;s Souvenir Programme&quot;, one sketch depicts the relationship between Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (played by John Finnemore and Simon Kane respectively) as that of aggrieved flatmates. They enter into a tit-for-tat exchange which ends in begrudging compromise after Jekyll threatens to get a vasectomy.
* In 2016, BBC Radio 4 produced &quot;The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;, with Stuart McQuarrie as Jekyll, John Dougall as Hyde and Madeleine Worrall as Lorna Utterson This version is presented as a speculative version of what the original &quot;Jekyll &amp; Hyde&quot; would have been like before Stevenson edited it based on his wife&#x27;s objections, and introduces the twist of a &quot;third&quot; identity for Jekyll in the form of George Denman, intended to represent all the most positive aspects of Jekyll&#x27;s character, only for Denman to regress to Hyde when he loses his temper.

<text>Arthur Golding (May 1606) was an English translator of more than 30 works from Latin into English. While primarily remembered today for his translation of Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; because of its influence on William Shakespeare&#x27;s works, in his own time he was most famous for his translation of Caesar&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries&quot;, and his translations of the sermons of John Calvin were important in spreading the doctrines of the Protestant Reformation.

==Biography==
Arthur Golding was born in East Anglia, before 25 May 1535/36, the second son of John Golding of Belchamp St Paul and Halstead, Essex, an auditor of the Exchequer, and his second wife, Ursula (d. c. 1564), daughter and co-heir of William Merston of Horton in Surrey, in a family of eleven children (four from John Golding&#x27;s first wife, Elizabeth). In the 15th and 16th centuries, the Golding family had prospered in the cloth trade, and by marrying heiresses had become fairly wealthy and respectable by the time of Arthur&#x27;s birth, probably in London. 

When Golding was 11, his father died. In 1548, his half-sister Margery, by John&#x27;s first wife, became the second wife of John de Vere, 16th Earl of Oxford, and, by 1552, his brother Henry was steward for his brother-in-law&#x27;s household. Another sister Dorothy married Edmund Docwra MP of Crookham, Berkshire, and was mother of the soldier and statesman Henry Docwra, 1st Baron Docwra of Culmore.

By 1549, Arthur was in the service of Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, then Lord Protector. He matriculated as a fellow commoner at Jesus College, Cambridge in 1552. Henry was elected to Parliament in 1558, probably because of Oxford&#x27;s influence, and from the later 1550s, Arthur worked on a translation of Pompeius Trogus that he planned to dedicate to Oxford. But Oxford died in August 1562, and his son Edward, the 17th earl, became a ward in the house of William Cecil, Lord Burghley, in The Strand. Cecil appears to have employed Golding as his nephew&#x27;s receiver for several years, for two of his dedications are dated from Cecil House, and in 1567 he dated a dedication from Barwicke, one of the de Vere manors near White Colne, Essex.

Golding married Usula (d. 1610), daughter of John Roydon of Chilham, Kent, sometime before 1575. They had eight children. The death in 1576 of an older brother, Henry, left him with some property, but it was heavily encumbered with debt and litigation with the heirs of his brother&#x27;s widow proved expensive. Golding borrowed heavily in the 1580s and was in debtors&#x27; prison in the early 1590s. He died in May 1606 and was buried on 13 May at St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Belchamp St Paul.
==Translation of Ovid==
Golding is remembered chiefly for his translation of Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. The first edition appeared in 1567 and was the first to be translated directly from Latin into English. However, Golding may not have been the first, and certainly not the only early Elizabethan author to attempt a translation of this great work. In his &quot;Pleasant Fable of Hermaphroditus and Salmacis&quot; (1565), Thomas Peend says that he had already started on his own version when he heard that another gentleman -- Golding -- was engaged on the same task, and so he gave up. A revised edition appeared in 1575 and there were further editions in 1587, 1603 and 1612. Many other translations followed, including George Sandys&#x27;s (1621) and Samuel Garth&#x27;s (1717). Golding&#x27;s translation, however, was read by Shakespeare and Spenser and &quot;conveys a spirited Ovid with all his range of emotion and diversity of plot&quot;. Golding represents the stories he translates in a vivid way, &quot;delivering every twist and turn in as whole-hearted a manner as possible&quot;. His translations are clear, faithful and fluent, as seen in this excerpt where Ovid compares blood gushing from Pyramus&#x27; wound to water bursting from a pipe:
And when he had bewept and kist the garment which he knew,&lt;br&gt;
Receyve thou my bloud too (quoth he) and therewithal he drew&lt;br&gt;
His sworde, the which among his guttes he thrust, and by and by&lt;br&gt;
Did draw it from the bleeding wound beginning for to die,&lt;br&gt;
And cast himself upon his backe, the bloud did spin on hie&lt;br&gt;
As when a Conduite pipe is crackt, the water bursting out&lt;br&gt;
Doth shote it selfe a great way off and pierce the Ayre about. (4.143–9)
Written in rhyming couplets of iambic heptameter (fourteeners), the book&#x27;s full title was &quot;The Fyrst Fower Bookes of P. Ovidius Nasos Worke, Entitled Metamorphosis, Translated Oute of Latin into Englishe Meter&quot; (1565). In 1567 Golding completed all fifteen books of Ovid&#x27;s poem. The influence of this book and ultimately its translation did not go unnoticed and was influential to many great writers. Its influence has been detected in Spenser&#x27;s &quot;Faerie Queene&quot;, in John Studley&#x27;s translations of Seneca, in Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Tamburlaine&quot; and &quot;Edward II&quot;, and many more. Even William Shakespeare knew of Golding&#x27;s Ovid and recalls it in a number of his plays. However, Shakespeare did have knowledge of versions other than Golding&#x27;s—for instance, a passage in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot; seems to have a closer resemblance to the original Latin text than to Golding&#x27;s English version. 

Golding&#x27;s translation, though, is without any question the most influential version on Shakespeare, and Shakespeare&#x27;s use of it has become an important part of the history of the translation itself. As a man of strong Puritan sympathies, he intended the work to be read as a moral allegory, and a verse on the title page cautioned the reader that:

With skill heede and judgment thys work must bee red&lt;br&gt;
For else to the reader it stands in small stead.
He prefixed a long metrical explanation of his reasons for considering it a work of edification, in which he asked his readers to look past the heretical content of the pagan poem, set forth the morals which he supposed to underlie the stories, and attempted to show how the pagan machinery might be brought into line with Christian thought.

It was from Golding&#x27;s pages that many of the Elizabethans drew their knowledge of classical mythology. In his &quot;ABC of Reading&quot;, Ezra Pound reproduced passages of the translation, noting: &quot;Though it is the most beautiful book in the English language, I am not citing it for its decorative purposes but its narrative quality.&quot;

==Other translations==
Most of Golding&#x27;s work consists of prose translations that were from Latin and French texts. A Calvinist, he translated contemporary Protestant leaders: Heinrich Bullinger, William, Prince of Orange, Theodore Beza, and Philippe de Mornay. He translated also Leonardo Bruni&#x27;s &quot;History of the War Against the Goths&quot;, Froissart&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles&quot; in Sleidan&#x27;s epitome, and Aesop&#x27;s fables. Further translations were: the &quot;Commentaries&quot; of Caesar (1563, 1565, 1590), the history of Junianus Justinus (1564), the theological writings of Niels Hemmingsen (1569) and David Chytraeus (1570), Theodore Beza&#x27;s &quot;Tragedie of Abrahams Sacrifice&quot; (1575), the &quot;De Beneficiis&quot; of Seneca the Younger (1578), the geography of Pomponius Mela (1585), the &quot;Polyhistor&quot; of Gaius Julius Solinus (1587), Calvin&#x27;s commentaries on the &quot;Psalms&quot; (1571), his sermons on the &quot;Galatians&quot; and &quot;Ephesians&quot;, on &quot;Deuteronomy&quot; and the &quot;Book of Job&quot;.

Golding was given the job of completing John Brende&#x27;s translation of Caesar&#x27;s &quot;Gallic War&quot; when Brende died. Sir William Cecil passed the manuscript to Golding for completion sometime between Brende&#x27;s death in 1560 or 1561 (the exact year he died is not certain) and 1564. At the same time Golding was working on the first four books of Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, which he finished in December 1564. He completed a translation begun by Philip Sidney from Philippe de Mornay, &quot;A Worke concerning the Trewnesse of the Christian Religion&quot; (1587).

He produced few original works. One was the account of a murder in 1573 and another of a prose &quot;Discourse&quot; on the earthquake of 1580, in which he saw a judgment of God on the wickedness of his time. He inherited three considerable estates in Essex, the greater part of which he sold in 1595. The last record of Golding in an order dated 25 July 1605, giving him license to print some of his works.

In recent years Golding&#x27;s prose translations of the Psalms (included in his translation of Calvin&#x27;s Commentaries) have attracted attention for their accuracy, clarity, good English and sober poise. They have been extracted from the Commentary and published separately, well-edited by Richard G. Barnes, as &quot;The first separate edition of the Psalms of David and others / as rendered into English by Arthur Golding&quot; (San Francisco, Arion, 1971). Donald Davie discusses them with high praise, and reprints many, in &quot;The Psalms In English&quot; (Penguin, 1996).

Golding, in the translation of &quot;The sermons of J. Calvin upon Deuteronomie&quot;, has the first known recorded instance of the idiom &quot;neither here nor there&quot;.

Over the course of his lifetime, Golding translated up to 5.5 million words.

==Legacy==
Golding&#x27;s &quot;puritan cast of mind&quot; is an important aspect of his writing. During his time it was more uncommon to translate works that reflect pagan society, such as works by Ovid. Golding, however, did not allow conformity to sway his work. Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, for example, does not mention Christian symbols; in fact, it was written before Christ&#x27;s time. What makes Arthur Golding an influential and important character to study is his desire to pull Christian symbolism from the text and write in such a way as to make the work accessible to his peers. Undoubtedly, Golding spent time translating works by Calvin that would further his reputation as a decent Puritan, but by challenging the authority that condemns so-called &quot;pagan&quot; texts such as the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, Golding forged a path for subsequent writers. Golding&#x27;s influence upon Shakespeare&#x27;s knowledge of Ovid cannot be diminished. Without Golding&#x27;s translation, common knowledge of the ancient text would not have been understood in the same clear light. In essence, Golding&#x27;s contribution to English literature was his translation of the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; because not only does he create an accessible work for many to understand, but he also translates in such a way as to infuse the work with Christian theology.

<doc id="235921" wikidata="Q442902" url="?curid=235921" title="Charlotte Smith (writer)">
<text>Charlotte Smith (née Turner; – ) was an English novelist and poet of the School of Sensibility whose &quot;Elegiac Sonnets&quot; (1784) contributed to the revival of the form in England. She also helped to set conventions for Gothic fiction and wrote political novels of sensibility. Despite ten novels, four children&#x27;s books and other works, she saw herself mainly as a poet and expected to be remembered for that. 

Smith left her husband and began writing to support their children. Her struggles for legal independence as a woman affect her poetry, novels and autobiographical prefaces. She is credited with turning the sonnet into an expression of woeful sentiment and her early novels show development in sentimentality. Later novels such as &quot;Desmond&quot; and &quot;The Old Manor House&quot; praised the ideals of the French Revolution. Waning interest left her destitute by 1803. Barely able to hold a pen, she sold her book collection to pay debts and died in 1806. Largely forgotten by the mid-19th century, she has since been seen as a major Romantic precursor.

==Early life==
Charlotte Turner was born on 4 May 1749 in London and baptised on 12 June as the oldest child of well-to-do Nicholas Turner and Anna Towers. Her two siblings, Nicholas and Catherine Ann, were born over the next five years. Smith received a typical girl&#x27;s education in a wealthy, late 18th-century family. Her childhood was marked by her mother&#x27;s early death (probably giving birth to Catherine) and her father&#x27;s reckless spending. After losing his wife, Nicholas Turner travelled and the children were raised by Lucy Towers, their maternal aunt; when exactly their father returned is unknown.

At the age of six, Charlotte went to school in Chichester and took drawing lessons from the painter George Smith. Two years later, she, her aunt and her sister moved to London, where she attended a girls&#x27; school in Kensington and learned dancing, drawing, music and acting. She loved to read and wrote poems, which her father encouraged. She even submitted a few to the &quot;Lady&#x27;s Magazine&quot; for publication, but they were not accepted.

==Marriage and first publication==

Nicholas Turner met with financial difficulties on his return to England and had to sell some of the family&#x27;s holdings. He married the wealthy Henrietta Meriton in 1765. His daughter entered society at the age of 12, leaving school and being tutored at home. His reckless spending then forced her to marry early. In a marriage on 23 February 1765 at the age of 15, which she later described as prostitution, she was given by her father to a violent, profligate man, Benjamin Smith, son of Richard Smith, a wealthy West Indian merchant and a director of the East India Company. The marriage proposal was accepted for her by her father. Condemning his action 40 years later, Smith said it had turned her into a &quot;legal prostitute&quot;.

The Smiths had twelve children. Their first, in 1766, died the next year just days after the birth of their second, Benjamin Berney (1767–1777). Their ten more children between 1767 and 1785 were William Towers (born 1768), Charlotte Mary (born 1769), Braithwaite (born 1770), Nicholas Hankey (1771–1837), Charles Dyer (born 1773), Anna Augusta (1774–1794), Lucy Eleanor (born 1776), Lionel (1778–1842), Harriet (born c. 1782), and George (born c. 1785). Six of their children survived her.

The Smith marriage was unhappy. She detested living in commercial Cheapside (the family later moved to Southgate and Tottenham) and argued with her in-laws, whom she saw as unrefined and uneducated. They in turn mocked her for spending time reading, writing and drawing. Meanwhile Benjamin proved violent, unfaithful and profligate. Only her father-in-law, Richard, appreciated her writing abilities, although he wanted her to use them to further his business interests. Richard Smith owned plantations in Barbados, which provided the income of £2000 a year upon which Charlotte Smith and her family lived. Smith would later criticize slavery in works such as &quot;The Old Manor House&quot; (1793) and &quot;Beachy Head&quot; (1807).

She persuaded Richard to set Benjamin up as a gentleman farmer in Hampshire and lived with him from 1774 until 1783 at Lys Farm, Bramdean, about 10 miles east of Winchester. Worried about Charlotte&#x27;s future and that of his grandchildren and concerned that his son would continue his irresponsible ways, Richard Smith willed most of his property to Charlotte&#x27;s children. However, he drew up the will himself and it contained legal problems. The inheritance, originally worth nearly £36,000, was tied up in chancery after his death in 1776 for almost 40 years. Smith and her children saw little of it. (It has been proposed that this may have inspired the famous fictional case of interminable legal proceedings, Jarndyce and Jarndyce, in Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Bleak House&quot;.

In fact, Benjamin illegally spent at least a third of the legacy and ended up in King&#x27;s Bench Prison, a debtor&#x27;s prison, in December 1783. Smith moved in with him and it was there that she wrote and published her first work. &quot;Elegiac Sonnets&quot; (1784) achieved instant success, allowing Charlotte to pay for their release from prison. Smith&#x27;s sonnets helped initiate a revival of the form and granted an aura of respectability to her later novels, as poetry was then considered the highest art. Smith revised &quot;Elegiac Poems&quot; several times over the years, eventually creating a two-volume work.

==Novelist and poet==

Smith&#x27;s husband fled to France to escape his creditors. She joined him there until, thanks largely to her, he was able to return to England.

After Benjamin Smith was released from prison, the entire family moved to Dieppe, France to avoid further creditors. Charlotte returned to negotiate with them, but failed to come to an agreement. She went back to France and in 1784 began translating works from French into English. In 1787 she published &quot;The Romance of Real Life&quot;, consisting of translated selections on François Gayot de Pitaval&#x27;s trials. She was forced to withdraw her other translation, &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot;, after it was argued that the work was immoral and plagiarised. In 1786, she published it anonymously.

In 1785, the family returned to England and moved to Woolbeding House near Midhurst, Sussex. Smith&#x27;s relations with her husband did not improve and on 15 April 1787 she left him after 22 years of marriage, writing that she might &quot;have been contented to reside in the same house with him&quot; had not &quot;his temper been so capricious and often so cruel,&quot; so that her &quot;life was not safe&quot;. When Charlotte left Benjamin, she did not secure a legal agreement to protect her profits – he would have access to them under English primogeniture laws. Smith knew that her children&#x27;s future rested on a successful settlement of the lawsuit over her father-in-law&#x27;s will, and so made every effort to earn enough money to fund the suit and retain the family&#x27;s genteel status.

Smith claimed the position of gentlewoman, signing herself &quot;Charlotte Smith of Bignor Park&quot; on the title page of &quot;Elegiac Sonnets&quot;. All her works were published under her own name, &quot;a daring decision&quot; for a woman at the time. Her success as a poet allowed her to make this choice and she identified herself as a poet throughout her career. Although she published far more prose than poetry and her novels brought her more money and fame, she believed poetry would bring her respectability. As Sarah Zimmerman claimed in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, &quot;She prized her verse for the role it gave her as a private woman whose sorrows were submitted only reluctantly to the public.&quot;

After leaving her husband, Smith moved to a town near Chichester and decided to write novels, as they would make more money than poetry. Her first one, &quot;Emmeline&quot; (1788), was a success, selling 1500 copies within months. She wrote nine more in the next ten years: &quot;Ethelinde&quot; (1789), &quot;Celestina&quot; (1791), &quot;Desmond&quot; (1792), &quot;The Old Manor House&quot; (1793), &quot;The Wanderings of Warwick&quot; (1794), &quot;The Banished Man&quot; (1794), &quot;Montalbert&quot; (1795), &quot;Marchmont&quot; (1796), &quot;The Young Philosopher&quot; (1798), and &quot;Letters of a Solitary Wanderer&quot; (1800, 1802). Smith was beginning her novelist career at a time when women&#x27;s fiction was expected to focus on romance and to focus on &quot;a chaste and flawless heroine subjected to repeated melodramatic distresses until reinstated in society by the virtuous hero&quot;. Although Smith&#x27;s novels employed this structure, they also included political commentary, notably support of the French Revolution through her male characters. At times, she challenged the typical romance plot by including &quot;narratives of female desire&quot; or &quot;tales of females suffering despotism&quot;. Her novels contributed to the development of Gothic fiction and the novel of sensibility.

Smith&#x27;s novels include autobiographical characters and events. While a common device at the time, Antje Blank writes in &quot;The Literary Encyclopedia&quot;, &quot;few exploited fiction&#x27;s potential of self-representation with such determination as Smith.&quot; For example, Mr and Mrs Stafford in &quot;Emmeline&quot; are portraits of Charlotte and Benjamin. She suffered sorely throughout her life. Her mother died in childbirth when Charlotte was three. Charlotte&#x27;s own first child died a day after her second child, Benjamin Berney, was born and Benjamin lived only ten years. The prefaces to Smith&#x27;s novels told of her own struggles, including the deaths of several of her children. According to Zimmerman, &quot;Smith mourned most publicly for her daughter Anna Augusta, who married an émigré... and died aged twenty in 1795.&quot; Smith&#x27;s prefaces placed her as a suffering sentimental heroine and as a vocal critic of laws that kept her and her children in poverty.
Smith&#x27;s experiences led her to argue for legal reforms that would grant women more rights, making the case for these in her novels. Her stories showed the &quot;legal, economic, and sexual exploitation&quot; of women by marriage and property laws. Initially readers were swayed by her arguments; writers such as William Cowper patronised her. However, as years passed readers became exhausted by Smith&#x27;s stories of struggle and inequality. The public shifted to the view of the poet Anna Seward, who called Smith &quot;vain&quot; and &quot;indelicate&quot; for exposing her husband to &quot;public contempt&quot;.

Smith moved frequently due to financial concerns and declining health. In the last 20 years of her life, she lived in: Chichester, Brighton, Storrington, Bath, Exmouth, Weymouth, Oxford, London, Frant, and Elstead. She eventually settled at Tilford, Surrey.

Smith became involved with English radicals while living in Brighton in 1791–1793. Like them, she supported the French Revolution and its republican principles. Her epistolary novel &quot;Desmond&quot; tells of a man journeying to revolutionary France and convinced of the rightness of the revolution. He contends that England should be reformed as well. The novel was published in June 1792, a year before France and Britain went to war and before the Reign of Terror began, which shocked the public, turning them against the revolutionaries. Like many radicals, Smith criticised the French, but retained the original ideals of the revolution. To support her family, Smith had to sell her works, and so was eventually forced, as Blank claims, to &quot;tone down the radicalism that had characterised the authorial voice in &quot;Desmond&quot; and adopt more oblique techniques to express her libertarian ideals&quot;. She set her next novel, &quot;The Old Manor House&quot; (1793) in the American War of Independence, which allowed her to discuss democratic reform without directly addressing the French situation. However, her last novel, &quot;The Young Philosopher&quot; (1798), was a final piece of &quot;outspoken radical fiction&quot;. Her protagonist leaves Britain for a more hopeful America.

&quot;The Old Manor House&quot; is &quot;frequently deemed [Smith&#x27;s] best&quot; novel for its sentimental themes and development of minor characters. Novelist Walter Scott labelled it as such, and poet and critic Anna Laetitia Barbauld chose it for her anthology &quot;The British Novelists&quot; (1810). As a successful novelist and poet, Smith communicated with famous artists and thinkers of the day, including musician Charles Burney (father of Frances Burney), poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, scientist and poet Erasmus Darwin, lawyer and radical Thomas Erskine, novelist Mary Hays, playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan, and poet Robert Southey. An array of periodicals reviewed her works, including the &quot;Anti-Jacobin Review&quot;, the &quot;Analytical Review&quot;, the &quot;British Critic&quot;, &quot;The Critical Review&quot;, the &quot;European Magazine&quot;, the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, the &quot;Monthly Magazine&quot;, and the &quot;Universal Magazine&quot;.

Smith earned most money between 1787 and 1798, after which she was no longer so popular; several reasons have been given for the declining public interest, including &quot;erosion of the quality of her work after so many years of literary labour, an eventual waning of readerly interest as she published, on average, one work per year for twenty-two years, and a controversy that attached to her public profile&quot; as she wrote on the French Revolution. Both radical and conservative periodicals criticized her novels about the revolution. Her insistence on pursuing a lawsuit over Richard Smith&#x27;s inheritance lost her several patrons. Her increasingly blunt prefaces made her less appealing.

To continue earning money, Smith began writing in less politically charged genres. This included a collection of tales, &quot;Letters of a Solitary Wanderer&quot; (1801–1802) and the play &quot;What Is She?&quot; (1799, attributed). Her most successful foray was into children&#x27;s books: &quot;Rural Walks&quot; (1795), &quot;Rambles Farther&quot; (1796), &quot;Minor Morals&quot; (1798), and &quot;Conversations Introducing Poetry&quot; (1804). She also wrote two volumes of a history of England (1806) and &quot;A Natural History of Birds&quot; (1807, posthumous). Her return to poetry, &quot;Beachy Head and Other Poems&quot; (1807) also appeared posthumously. Publishers paid less for these, however, and by 1803 Smith was poverty-stricken. She could barely afford food or coal. She even sold her beloved library of 500 books to pay off debts, but feared being sent to jail for the remaining £20.

==Illness and death==
Smith complained of gout for many years (it was likely rheumatoid arthritis), which made it increasingly difficult and painful for her to write. By the end of her life, it had almost paralysed her. She wrote to a friend that she was &quot;literally vegetating, for I have very little locomotive powers beyond those that appertain to a cauliflower.&quot; On 23 February 1806, her husband died in a debtors&#x27; prison and Smith finally received some money he owed her, but she was too ill to do anything with it. She died at Tilford a few months later, on 28 October 1806, and was buried at Stoke Church, Stoke Park, near Guildford. The lawsuit over her father-in-law&#x27;s estate was settled seven years later, on 22 April 1813, more than 36 years after Richard Smith&#x27;s death.

==Literary circle==
Smith&#x27;s novels were read and assessed by friends who were also writers, as she would return the favour and they found it beneficial to improve and encourage each other&#x27;s work. Ann Radcliffe, who also wrote Gothic fiction, was among those friends. Along with praise, Smith also received backlash from other writers. &quot;Jane Austen – though she ridiculed Smith&#x27;s novels, actually borrowed plot, character, and incident from them.&quot; John Bennet (1792) wrote that &quot;the little sonnets of Miss Charlotte Smith are soft, pensive, sentimental and pathetic, as a woman&#x27;s productions should be. The muses, if I mistake not, will, in time, raise her to a considerable eminence. She has, as yet, stepped forth only in little things, with a diffidence that is characteristic of real genius in its first attempts. Her next public entre may be more in style, and more consequential.&quot; Smith is never too specific about her republicanism; her ideas rest on the scholars Rousseau, Voltaire Diderot, Montesquieu, and John Locke. &quot;Charlotte Smith tried not to swim too strongly against the current of public view, because she needed to sell her novels in order to provide for her children.&quot;

Robert Southey, a poet and contributor to the early Romanticist movement, also sympathised with Smith&#x27;s hardships. He says, &quot;[although] she has done more and done better than other women writers, it has not been her whole employment — she is not looking out for admiration and talking to show off.&quot; In addition to Jane Austen, Henrietta O&#x27;Neill, Reverend Joseph Cooper Walker, and Sarah Rose were people Smith saw as trusted friends. Having become famous for marrying into a great Irish home, Henrietta O&#x27;Neill, like Austen, provided Smith &quot;with a poetic, sympathetic friendship and with literary connections,&quot; helping her gain an &quot;entry into a fashionable, literary world to which she otherwise had little access; here she almost certainly met Dr. Moore (author of &quot;A View of Society and Manners in Italy and Zeluco&quot;) and Lady Londonderry.

One of Smith&#x27;s longest friends and respected mentors was Reverend Joseph Cooper Walker, a Dublin antiquarian and writer. &quot;Walker handled her dealings with John Rice, who published Dublin editions of many of her works. She confided openly in Walker about literary and familial matters.&quot; Through publication of personal letters Smith sent to a close companion, Sarah Rose, readers are shown a more positive and joyful side to Smith. Although today his writing is seen as mediocre, William Hayley, another friend of Smith&#x27;s, was &quot;liked, respected, influential&quot; in their time, especially as he was offered the laureateship on the death of Thomas Warton.&quot; As time went on, Hayley Smith withdrew support from her in 1794 and corresponded with her only infrequently. Smith saw Hayley&#x27;s actions as betrayal; he would often make claims that she was a &quot;Lady of signal sorrows, signal woes.&quot; Even with her success as a writer and handful of accredited friends through her lifetime, Smith was &quot;sadly isolated from other writers and literary friends.&quot; Although many believed in Hayley&#x27;s statements, many saw Smith as a &quot;woman of signal achievement, energy, ambition, devotion, and sacrifice. Her children and her literary career evoked from her best efforts, and did so in about equal measure.&quot;

==Legacy and critical reputation==
Stuart Curran, as editor of Smith&#x27;s poems, has written that she is &quot;the first poet in England whom in retrospect we would call Romantic&quot;. She helped shape the &quot;patterns of thought and conventions of style&quot; for the period and was responsible for rekindling the sonnet form in England. She influenced popular Romantic poets of her time such as, William Wordsworth and John Keats. Wordsworth, the leading Romantic poet, believed that Smith wrote &quot;with true feeling for rural nature, at a time when nature was not much regarded by English Poets&quot;. He also stated in the 1830s that she was &quot;a lady to whom English verse is under greater obligations than are likely to be either acknowledged or remembered.&quot; By the mid-19th century, however, Smith was largely forgotten. Smith was respected also for her ten novels, publishing works in a variety of genres. These include Gothic, revolutionary, educational, epistolary but always incorporating the novel of sensibility. Although they have yet to receive any &quot;critical attention&quot; today, Smith was famous for children&#x27;s books she wrote in her writing period. Smith is noted as one of the most popular poets of her time. One of the first poets to receive a salary, Henry James Pye claimed Smith was &quot;[excelled] in two species of composition so different as the novel and the sonnet, and whose powers are so equally capable of charming the imagination, and awakening the passions.&quot;

Smith is known for striving to produce her writing at the same level and expectation as her contemporaries Anna Laetitia Barbauld and Maria Edgeworth. The inspiration she received from these writers helped her build an audience and dominate in certain genres. Smith was notorious for not only expressing her personal and emotional struggles but also for the anxiety and complications she faced when it came to meeting deadlines, mailing out completed volumes, and payment advancements. She was keen in persuading her publishers to work with her issues. Smith would submit final drafts in exchange for &quot;food, lodging, and expenses for her children&quot;. Other publishers willing to negotiate with Smith throughout her career as a writer were Thomas Cadell the elder, Thomas Cadell the younger, and William Davies. Unfortunately she also struggled with disputes from &quot;various booksellers over copyright, a printer&#x27;s competence, or the quality of an engraving for an illustration. She would argue that the time was ripe for a second edition of a novel.&quot;

Smith &quot;clung to her own sense of herself as a gentlewoman of integrity&quot;. The negative sides that Smith claimed to have experienced during the publication process were perceived as self-pity by many publishers of her time, affecting her relationship and reputation with them. Smith&#x27;s push to be taken seriously and how she emerges as an essential figure of the &quot;Age of Sensibility&quot; is observed in her powerful use of vulnerability. Antje Blank of &quot;The Literary Encyclopedia&quot; states, &quot;Few exploited fiction&#x27;s potential of self-representation with such determination as Smith.&quot; Her work is defined as &quot;squarely in the cult of sensibility: she believed in the virtue of kindness, in generosity to those less fortunate, and in the cultivation of the finer feelings of sympathy and tenderness for those who suffered needlessly.&quot;

Ultimately, &quot;Smith&#x27;s autobiographical incursions&quot; bridge the old and the new, &quot;older poetic forms and an emerging Romantic voice.&quot; Smith was a skillful satirist and political commentator on the condition of England, and this is, I think, the most interesting aspect of her fiction and the one that had most influence on later writers.&quot; Oneț felt that Smith&#x27;s work &quot;rejected an identity defined exclusively by emotionality, matrimony, the family unit, and female sexuality.&quot; Overall Smith&#x27;s career in writing was rejoiced, well perceived and popular until her later years of living. &quot;Smith deserves to be read not simply as a writer whose work demonstrates changes in taste, but as one of the primary voices of her time and a worthy contemporary of the male romantic poets.&quot;

Smith&#x27;s novels reappeared at the end of the 20th century, when critics &quot;interested in the period&#x27;s women poets and prose writers, the Gothic novel, the historical novel, the social problem novel, and post-colonial studies&quot; argued for her significance as a writer. They concluded that she helped to revitalise the English sonnet, a view found in Coleridge and others. Scott wrote that she &quot;preserves in her landscapes the truth and precision of a painter&quot; and poet. Barbauld claimed that Smith was the first to include sustained natural description in novels. In 2008, Smith&#x27;s complete prose became available to the general public. The edition contains all her novels, the children&#x27;s stories and rural walks.

<doc id="235923" wikidata="Q106612" url="?curid=235923" title="Buttermilk">
<text>Buttermilk is a fermented dairy drink. Traditionally, it was the liquid left behind after churning butter out of cultured cream. As most modern butter in Western countries is not made with cultured cream but uncultured sweet cream, most modern buttermilk in Western countries is cultured separately. It is common in warm climates where unrefrigerated milk sours quickly.

Buttermilk can be drunk straight, and it can also be used in cooking. In making soda bread, the acid in buttermilk reacts with the raising agent, sodium bicarbonate, to produce carbon dioxide which acts as the leavening agent. Buttermilk is also used in marination, especially of chicken and pork.

== Traditional buttermilk ==
Originally, buttermilk referred to the thin liquid left over from churning butter from cultured or fermented cream. Traditionally, before the advent of homogenization, the milk was left to sit for a period of time to allow the cream and milk to separate. During this time, naturally occurring lactic acid-producing bacteria in the milk fermented it. This facilitates the butter churning process, since fat from cream with a lower pH coalesces more readily than that of fresh cream. The acidic environment also helps prevent potentially harmful microorganisms from growing, increasing shelf life.

Traditional buttermilk is still common in many Arab, Indian, Nepalese, Pakistani, Finnish, Polish, Dutch, German, Danish, and Austrian households, but rarely found in other Western countries. It is a common drink in many Indian and Nepalese homes, and often served with roasted maize. In Arab culture, buttermilk is commonly sold ice cold with other dairy products. It is popular during Ramadan, when it is consumed during iftar and suhur.

== Cultured buttermilk ==

Commercially available cultured buttermilk is milk that has been pasteurized and homogenized, and then inoculated with a culture of &quot;Lactococcus lactis&quot; or &quot;Lactobacillus bulgaricus&quot; plus &quot;Leuconostoc citrovorum&quot; to simulate the naturally occurring bacteria in the old-fashioned product. The tartness of cultured buttermilk is primarily due to lactic acid produced by lactic acid bacteria while fermenting lactose, the primary sugar in milk. As the bacteria produce lactic acid, the pH of the milk decreases and casein, the primary milk protein, precipitates, causing the curdling or clabbering of milk, making cultured buttermilk thicker than plain milk. While both traditional and cultured buttermilk contain lactic acid, traditional buttermilk is thinner than cultured buttermilk.

=== United States ===

Cultured buttermilk was first commercially introduced in the United States in the 1920s. It was initially popular among immigrants, and was viewed as a food that could slow aging. It reached peak annual sales of 517,000,000 kg (1.14 billion lbs.) in 1960. Buttermilk&#x27;s popularity has declined since then, and annual sales in 2012 reached less than half that number.
However, condensed buttermilk and dried buttermilk remain important in the food industry. Liquid buttermilk is used primarily in the commercial preparation of baked goods and cheese. Buttermilk solids are used in ice cream manufacturing, as well as being added to pancake mixes to make buttermilk pancakes.

== Acidified buttermilk ==
&quot;Acidified buttermilk&quot; is a substitute made by adding a food-grade acid, such as white vinegar or lemon juice, to milk. It can be produced by mixing 1 tablespoon () of acid with 1 cup () of milk and letting it sit until it curdles after about 10 minutes. Any level of fat content for the milk ingredient may be used, but whole milk is usually used for baking.

== Nutrition ==
Commercially produced buttermilk is comparable to regular milk in terms of food energy and fat. One cup (237 mL) of whole milk contains and 8.9 grams of fat. One cup of whole buttermilk contains and 8.1 grams of total fat. Low-fat buttermilk is also available. Buttermilk contains vitamins, potassium, calcium, and traces of phosphorus.

<text>A DNA polymerase is a member of a family of enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of DNA molecules from nucleoside triphosphates, the molecular precursors of DNA. These enzymes are essential for DNA replication and usually work in groups to create two identical DNA duplexes from a single original DNA duplex. During this process, DNA polymerase &quot;reads&quot; the existing DNA strands to create two new strands that match the existing ones.
These enzymes catalyze the chemical reaction

: deoxynucleoside triphosphate + DNAn pyrophosphate + DNAn+1.

DNA polymerase adds nucleotides to the three prime (3&#x27;)-end of a DNA strand, one nucleotide at a time. Every time a cell divides, DNA polymerases are required to duplicate the cell&#x27;s DNA, so that a copy of the original DNA molecule can be passed to each daughter cell. In this way, genetic information is passed down from generation to generation.

Before replication can take place, an enzyme called helicase unwinds the DNA molecule from its tightly woven form, in the process breaking the hydrogen bonds between the nucleotide bases. This opens up or &quot;unzips&quot; the double-stranded DNA to give two single strands of DNA that can be used as templates for replication in the above reaction.

==History==
In 1956, Arthur Kornberg and colleagues discovered DNA polymerase I (Pol I), in &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;. They described the DNA replication process by which DNA polymerase copies the base sequence of a template DNA strand. Kornberg was later awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1959 for this work. DNA polymerase II was discovered by Thomas Kornberg (the son of Arthur Kornberg) and Malcolm E. Gefter in 1970 while further elucidating the role of Pol I in &quot;E. coli&quot; DNA replication. Three more DNA polymerases have been found in &quot;E. coli&quot;, including DNA polymerase III (discovered in the 1970s) and DNA polymerases IV and V (discovered in 1999). From 1983 on, DNA polymerases have been used in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and from 1988 thermostable DNA polymerases were used instead, as they do not need to be added in every cycle of a PCR.

== Function ==
The main function of DNA polymerase is to synthesize DNA from deoxyribonucleotides, the building blocks of DNA. The DNA copies are created by the pairing of nucleotides to bases present on each strand of the original DNA molecule. This pairing always occurs in specific combinations, with cytosine along with guanine, and thymine along with adenine, forming two separate pairs, respectively. By contrast, RNA polymerases synthesize RNA from ribonucleotides from either RNA or DNA.

When synthesizing new DNA, DNA polymerase can add free nucleotides only to the 3&#x27; end of the newly forming strand. This results in elongation of the newly forming strand in a 5&#x27;–3&#x27; direction.

It is important to note that the directionality of the newly forming strand (the daughter strand) is opposite to the direction in which DNA polymerase moves along the template strand. Since DNA polymerase requires a free 3&#x27; OH group for initiation of synthesis, it can synthesize in only one direction by extending the 3&#x27; end of the preexisting nucleotide chain. Hence, DNA polymerase moves along the template strand in a 3&#x27;–5&#x27; direction, and the daughter strand is formed in a 5&#x27;–3&#x27; direction. This difference enables the resultant double-strand DNA formed to be composed of two DNA strands that are antiparallel to each other.

The function of DNA polymerase is not quite perfect, with the enzyme making about one mistake for every billion base pairs copied. Error correction is a property of some, but not all DNA polymerases. This process corrects mistakes in newly synthesized DNA. When an incorrect base pair is recognized, DNA polymerase moves backwards by one base pair of DNA. The 3&#x27;–5&#x27; exonuclease activity of the enzyme allows the incorrect base pair to be excised (this activity is known as &quot;proofreading&quot;). Following base excision, the polymerase can re-insert the correct base and replication can continue forwards. This preserves the integrity of the original DNA strand that is passed onto the daughter cells.

Fidelity is very important in DNA replication. Mismatches in DNA base pairing can potentially result in dysfunctional proteins and could lead to cancer. Many DNA polymerases contain an exonuclease domain, which acts in detecting base pair mismatches and further performs in the removal of the incorrect nucleotide to be replaced by the correct one. The shape and the interactions accommodating the Watson and Crick base pair are what primarily contribute to the detection or error. Hydrogen bonds play a key role in base pair binding and interaction. The loss of an interaction, which occurs at a mismatch, is said to trigger a shift in the balance, for the binding of the template-primer, from the polymerase, to the exonuclease domain. In addition, an incorporation of a wrong nucleotide causes a retard in DNA polymerization. This delay gives time for the DNA to be switched from the polymerase site to the exonuclease site. Different conformational changes and loss of interaction occur at different mismatches. In a purine:pyrimidine mismatch there is a displacement of the pyrimidine towards the major groove and the purine towards the minor groove. Relative to the shape of DNA polymerase&#x27;s binding pocket, steric clashes occur between the purine and residues in the minor groove, and important van der Waals and electrostatic interactions are lost by the pyrimidine. Pyrimidine:pyrimidine and purine:purine mismatches present less notable changes since the bases are displaced towards the major groove, and less steric hindrance is experienced. However, although the different mismatches result in different steric properties, DNA polymerase is still able to detect and differentiate them so uniformly and maintain fidelity in DNA replication. DNA polymerization is also critical for many mutagenesis processes and is widely employed in biotechnologies.

=== Structure ===
The known DNA polymerases have highly conserved structure, which means that their overall catalytic subunits vary very little from species to species, independent of their domain structures. Conserved structures usually indicate important, irreplaceable functions of the cell, the maintenance of which provides evolutionary advantages. The shape can be described as resembling a right hand with thumb, finger, and palm domains. The palm domain appears to function in catalyzing the transfer of phosphoryl groups in the phosphoryl transfer reaction. DNA is bound to the palm when the enzyme is active. This reaction is believed to be catalyzed by a two-metal-ion mechanism. The finger domain functions to bind the nucleoside triphosphates with the template base. The thumb domain plays a potential role in the processivity, translocation, and positioning of the DNA.

===Processivity===
DNA polymerase&#x27;s rapid catalysis due to its processive nature. Processivity is a characteristic of enzymes that function on polymeric substrates. In the case of DNA polymerase, the degree of processivity refers to the average number of nucleotides added each time the enzyme binds a template. The average DNA polymerase requires about one second locating and binding a primer/template junction. Once it is bound, a nonprocessive DNA polymerase adds nucleotides at a rate of one nucleotide per second. Processive DNA polymerases, however, add multiple nucleotides per second, drastically increasing the rate of DNA synthesis. The degree of processivity is directly proportional to the rate of DNA synthesis. The rate of DNA synthesis in a living cell was first determined as the rate of phage T4 DNA elongation in phage infected &quot;E. coli&quot;. During the period of exponential DNA increase at 37 °C, the rate was 749 nucleotides per second.

DNA polymerase&#x27;s ability to slide along the DNA template allows increased processivity. There is a dramatic increase in processivity at the replication fork. This increase is facilitated by the DNA polymerase&#x27;s association with proteins known as the sliding DNA clamp. The clamps are multiple protein subunits associated in the shape of a ring. Using the hydrolysis of ATP, a class of proteins known as the sliding clamp loading proteins open up the ring structure of the sliding DNA clamps allowing binding to and release from the DNA strand. Protein–protein interaction with the clamp prevents DNA polymerase from diffusing from the DNA template, thereby ensuring that the enzyme binds the same primer/template junction and continues replication. DNA polymerase changes conformation, increasing affinity to the clamp when associated with it and decreasing affinity when it completes the replication of a stretch of DNA to allow release from the clamp.

DNA polymerase processivity has been studied with in vitro single-molecule experiments (namely, optical tweezers and magnetic tweezers) have revealed the synergies between DNA polymerases and other molecules of the replisome (helicases and SSBs) and with the DNA replication fork. These results have led to the development of synergetic kinetic models for DNA replication describing the resulting DNA polymerase processivity increase.

==Variation across species==


Based on sequence homology, DNA polymerases can be further subdivided into seven different families: A, B, C, D, X, Y, and RT.

Some viruses also encode special DNA polymerases, such as Hepatitis B virus DNA polymerase. These may selectively replicate viral DNA through a variety of mechanisms. Retroviruses encode an unusual DNA polymerase called reverse transcriptase, which is an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (RdDp). It polymerizes DNA from a template of RNA.

===Prokaryotic polymerase===
Prokaryotic polymerases exist in two forms: core polymerase and holoenzyme. Core polymerase synthesizes DNA from the DNA template but it cannot initiate the synthesis alone or accurately. Holoenzyme accurately initiates synthesis.

====Pol I====
Prokaryotic family A polymerases include the DNA polymerase I (Pol I) enzyme, which is encoded by the &quot;polA&quot; gene and ubiquitous among prokaryotes. This repair polymerase is involved in excision repair with both 3&#x27;–5&#x27; and 5&#x27;–3&#x27; exonuclease activity and processing of Okazaki fragments generated during lagging strand synthesis. Pol I is the most abundant polymerase, accounting for &gt;95% of polymerase activity in &quot;E. coli&quot;; yet cells lacking Pol I have been found suggesting Pol I activity can be replaced by the other four polymerases. Pol I adds ~15-20 nucleotides per second, thus showing poor processivity. Instead, Pol I starts adding nucleotides at the RNA primer:template junction known as the origin of replication (ori). Approximately 400 bp downstream from the origin, the Pol III holoenzyme is assembled and takes over replication at a highly processive speed and nature.

&quot;Taq&quot; polymerase is a heat-stable enzyme of this family that lacks proofreading ability.

====Pol II====
DNA polymerase II is a family B polymerase encoded by the polB gene. Pol II has 3&#x27;–5&#x27; exonuclease activity and participates in DNA repair, replication restart to bypass lesions, and its cell presence can jump from ~30-50 copies per cell to ~200–300 during SOS induction. Pol II is also thought to be a backup to Pol III as it can interact with holoenzyme proteins and assume a high level of processivity. The main role of Pol II is thought to be the ability to direct polymerase activity at the replication fork and help stalled Pol III bypass terminal mismatches.

&quot;Pfu&quot; DNA polymerase is a heat-stable enzyme of this family found in the hyperthermophilic archaeon &quot;Pyrococcus furiosus&quot;. Detailed classification divides family B in archaea into B1, B2, B3, in which B2 is a group of pseudoenzymes. &quot;Pfu&quot; belongs to family B3. Others PolBs found in archaea are part of &quot;Casposons&quot;, Cas1-dependent transposons. Some viruses (including Φ29 DNA polymerase) and mitochondrial plasmids carry polB as well.

====Pol III====
DNA polymerase III holoenzyme is the primary enzyme involved in DNA replication in &quot;E. coli&quot; and belongs to family C polymerases. It consists of three assemblies: the pol III core, the beta sliding clamp processivity factor, and the clamp-loading complex. The core consists of three subunits: α, the polymerase activity hub, ɛ, exonucleolytic proofreader, and θ, which may act as a stabilizer for ɛ. The beta sliding clamp processivity factor is also present in duplicate, one for each core, to create a clamp that encloses DNA allowing for high processivity. The third assembly is a seven-subunit (τ2γδδχψ) clamp loader complex.

The old textbook &quot;trombone model&quot; depicts an elongation complex with two equivalents of the core enzyme at each replication fork (RF), one for each strand, the lagging and leading. However, recent evidence from single-molecule studies indicates an average of three stoichiometric equivalents of core enzyme at each RF for both Pol III and its counterpart in &quot;B. subtilis,&quot; PolC. In-cell fluorescent microscopy has revealed that leading strand synthesis may not be completely continuous, and Pol III* (i.e., the holoenzyme α, ε, τ, δ and χ subunits without the ß2 sliding clamp) has a high frequency of dissociation from active RFs. In these studies, the replication fork turnover rate was about 10s for Pol III*, 47s for the ß2 sliding clamp, and 15m for the DnaB helicase. This suggests that the DnaB helicase may remain stably associated at RFs and serve as a nucleation point for the competent holoenzyme. &quot;In vitro&quot; single-molecule studies have shown that Pol III* has a high rate of RF turnover when in excess, but remains stably associated with replication forks when concentration is limiting. Another single-molecule study showed that DnaB helicase activity and strand elongation can proceed with decoupled, stochastic kinetics.

====Pol IV====
In &quot;E. coli&quot;, DNA polymerase IV (Pol IV) is an error-prone DNA polymerase involved in non-targeted mutagenesis. Pol IV is a Family Y polymerase expressed by the &quot;dinB&quot; gene that is switched on via SOS induction caused by stalled polymerases at the replication fork. During SOS induction, Pol IV production is increased tenfold and one of the functions during this time is to interfere with Pol III holoenzyme processivity. This creates a checkpoint, stops replication, and allows time to repair DNA lesions via the appropriate repair pathway. Another function of Pol IV is to perform translesion synthesis at the stalled replication fork like, for example, bypassing N2-deoxyguanine adducts at a faster rate than transversing undamaged DNA. Cells lacking the &quot;dinB&quot; gene have a higher rate of mutagenesis caused by DNA damaging agents.

====Pol V====
DNA polymerase V (Pol V) is a Y-family DNA polymerase that is involved in SOS response and translesion synthesis DNA repair mechanisms. Transcription of Pol V via the &quot;umuDC&quot; genes is highly regulated to produce only Pol V when damaged DNA is present in the cell generating an SOS response. Stalled polymerases causes RecA to bind to the ssDNA, which causes the LexA protein to autodigest. LexA then loses its ability to repress the transcription of the umuDC operon. The same RecA-ssDNA nucleoprotein posttranslationally modifies the UmuD protein into UmuD&#x27; protein. UmuD and UmuD&#x27; form a heterodimer that interacts with UmuC, which in turn activates umuC&#x27;s polymerase catalytic activity on damaged DNA. In &quot;E. coli&quot;, a polymerase &quot;tool belt&quot; model for switching pol III with pol IV at a stalled replication fork, where both polymerases bind simultaneously to the β-clamp, has been proposed. However, the involvement of more than one TLS polymerase working in succession to bypass a lesion has not yet been shown in &quot;E. coli&quot;. Moreover, Pol IV can catalyze both insertion and extension with high efficiency, whereas pol V is considered the major SOS TLS polymerase. One example is the bypass of intra strand guanine thymine cross-link where it was shown on the basis of the difference in the mutational signatures of the two polymerases, that pol IV and pol V compete for TLS of the intra-strand crosslink.

====Family D====
In 1998, the family D of DNA polymerase was discovered in &quot;Pyrococcus furiosus&quot; and &quot;Methanococcus jannaschii&quot;. The PolD complex is a heterodimer of two chains, each encoded by DP1 (small proofreading) and DP2 (large catalytic). Unlike other DNA polymerases, the structure and mechanism of the DP2 catalytic core resemble that of multi-subunit RNA polymerases. The DP1-DP2 interface resembles that of Eukaryotic Class B polymerase zinc finger and its small subunit. DP1, a Mre11-like exonuclease, is likely the precursor of small subunit of Pol α and ε, providing proofreading capabilities now lost in Eukaryotes. Its N-terminal HSH domain is similar to AAA proteins, especially Pol III subunit δ and RuvB, in structure. DP2 has a Class II KH domain. &quot;Pyrococcus abyssi&quot; polD is more heat-stable and more accurate than &quot;Taq&quot; polymerase, but has not yet been commercialized. It has been proposed that family D DNA polymerase was the first to evolve in cellular organisms and that the replicative polymerase of the Last Universal Cellular Ancestor (LUCA) belonged to family D.

===Eukaryotic DNA polymerase===

====Polymerases β, λ, σ, μ (beta, lambda, sigma, mu) and TdT====
Family X polymerases contain the well-known eukaryotic polymerase pol β (beta), as well as other eukaryotic polymerases such as Pol σ (sigma), Pol λ (lambda), Pol μ (mu), and Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). Family X polymerases are found mainly in vertebrates, and a few are found in plants and fungi. These polymerases have highly conserved regions that include two helix-hairpin-helix motifs that are imperative in the DNA-polymerase interactions. One motif is located in the 8 kDa domain that interacts with downstream DNA and one motif is located in the thumb domain that interacts with the primer strand. Pol β, encoded by POLB gene, is required for short-patch base excision repair, a DNA repair pathway that is essential for repairing alkylated or oxidized bases as well as abasic sites. Pol λ and Pol μ, encoded by the POLL and POLM genes respectively, are involved in non-homologous end-joining, a mechanism for rejoining DNA double-strand breaks due to hydrogen peroxide and ionizing radiation, respectively. TdT is expressed only in lymphoid tissue, and adds &quot;n nucleotides&quot; to double-strand breaks formed during V(D)J recombination to promote immunological diversity.

====Polymerases α, δ and ε (alpha, delta, and epsilon)====
Pol α (alpha), Pol δ (delta), and Pol ε (epsilon) are members of Family B Polymerases and are the main polymerases involved with nuclear DNA replication. Pol α complex (pol α-DNA primase complex) consists of four subunits: the catalytic subunit POLA1, the regulatory subunit POLA2, and the small and the large primase subunits PRIM1 and PRIM2 respectively. Once primase has created the RNA primer, Pol α starts replication elongating the primer with ~20 nucleotides. Due to its high processivity, Pol δ takes over the leading and lagging strand synthesis from Pol α. Pol δ is expressed by genes POLD1, creating the catalytic subunit, POLD2, POLD3, and POLD4 creating the other subunits that interact with Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA), which is a DNA clamp that allows Pol δ to possess processivity. Pol ε is encoded by the POLE1, the catalytic subunit, POLE2, and POLE3 gene. It has been reported that the function of Pol ε is to extend the leading strand during replication, while Pol δ primarily replicates the lagging strand; however, recent evidence suggested that Pol δ might have a role in replicating the leading strand of DNA as well. Pol ε&#x27;s C-terminus &quot;polymerase relic&quot; region, despite being unnecessary for polymerase activity, is thought to be essential to cell vitality. The C-terminus region is thought to provide a checkpoint before entering anaphase, provide stability to the holoenzyme, and add proteins to the holoenzyme necessary for initiation of replication. Pol ε has a larger &quot;palm&quot; domain that provides high processivity independently of PCNA.

Compared to other Family B polymerases, the DEDD exonuclease family responsible for proofreading is inactivated in Pol α. Pol ε is unique in that it has two zinc finger domains and an inactive copy of another family B polymerase in its C-terminal. The presence of this zinc finger has implications in the origins of Eukaryota, which in this case is placed into the &quot;Asgard&quot; group with archaeal B3 polymerase.

====Polymerases η, ι and κ (eta, iota, and kappa)====
Pol η (eta), Pol ι (iota), and Pol κ (kappa), are Family Y DNA polymerases involved in the DNA repair by translation synthesis and encoded by genes POLH, POLI, and POLK respectively. Members of Family Y have five common motifs to aid in binding the substrate and primer terminus and they all include the typical right hand thumb, palm and finger domains with added domains like little finger (LF), polymerase-associated domain (PAD), or wrist. The active site, however, differs between family members due to the different lesions being repaired. Polymerases in Family Y are low-fidelity polymerases, but have been proven to do more good than harm as mutations that affect the polymerase can cause various diseases, such as skin cancer and Xeroderma Pigmentosum Variant (XPS). The importance of these polymerases is evidenced by the fact that gene encoding DNA polymerase η is referred as XPV, because loss of this gene results in the disease Xeroderma Pigmentosum Variant. Pol η is particularly important for allowing accurate translesion synthesis of DNA damage resulting from ultraviolet radiation. The functionality of Pol κ is not completely understood, but researchers have found two probable functions. Pol κ is thought to act as an extender or an inserter of a specific base at certain DNA lesions. All three translesion synthesis polymerases, along with Rev1, are recruited to damaged lesions via stalled replicative DNA polymerases. There are two pathways of damage repair leading researchers to conclude that the chosen pathway depends on which strand contains the damage, the leading or lagging strand.

====Polymerases Rev1 and ζ (zeta)====
Pol ζ another B family polymerase, is made of two subunits Rev3, the catalytic subunit, and Rev7 (MAD2L2), which increases the catalytic function of the polymerase, and is involved in translesion synthesis. Pol ζ lacks 3&#x27; to 5&#x27; exonuclease activity, is unique in that it can extend primers with terminal mismatches. Rev1 has three regions of interest in the BRCT domain, ubiquitin-binding domain, and C-terminal domain and has dCMP transferase ability, which adds deoxycytidine opposite lesions that would stall replicative polymerases Pol δ and Pol ε. These stalled polymerases activate ubiquitin complexes that in turn disassociate replication polymerases and recruit Pol ζ and Rev1. Together Pol ζ and Rev1 add deoxycytidine and Pol ζ extends past the lesion. Through a yet undetermined process, Pol ζ disassociates and replication polymerases reassociate and continue replication. Pol ζ and Rev1 are not required for replication, but loss of REV3 gene in budding yeast can cause increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents due to collapse of replication forks where replication polymerases have stalled.

====Telomerase====
Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein which functions to replicate ends of linear chromosomes since normal DNA polymerase cannot replicate the ends, or telomeres. The single-strand 3&#x27; overhang of the double-strand chromosome with the sequence 5&#x27;-TTAGGG-3&#x27; recruits telomerase. Telomerase acts like other DNA polymerases by extending the 3&#x27; end, but, unlike other DNA polymerases, telomerase does not require a template. The TERT subunit, an example of a reverse transcriptase, uses the RNA subunit to form the primer–template junction that allows telomerase to extend the 3&#x27; end of chromosome ends. The gradual decrease in size of telomeres as the result of many replications over a lifetime are thought to be associated with the effects of aging.

====Polymerases γ, θ and ν (gamma, theta and nu)====

Pol γ (gamma), Pol θ (theta), and Pol ν (nu) are Family A polymerases. Pol γ, encoded by the POLG gene, was long thought to be the only mitochondrial polymerase. However, recent research shows that at least Pol β (beta), a Family X polymerase, is also present in mitochondria. Any mutation that leads to limited or non-functioning Pol γ has a significant effect on mtDNA and is the most common cause of autosomal inherited mitochondrial disorders. Pol γ contains a C-terminus polymerase domain and an N-terminus 3&#x27;–5&#x27; exonuclease domain that are connected via the linker region, which binds the accessory subunit. The accessory subunit binds DNA and is required for processivity of Pol γ. Point mutation A467T in the linker region is responsible for more than one-third of all Pol γ-associated mitochondrial disorders. While many homologs of Pol θ, encoded by the POLQ gene, are found in eukaryotes, its function is not clearly understood. The sequence of amino acids in the C-terminus is what classifies Pol θ as Family A polymerase, although the error rate for Pol θ is more closely related to Family Y polymerases. Pol θ extends mismatched primer termini and can bypass abasic sites by adding a nucleotide. It also has Deoxyribophosphodiesterase (dRPase) activity in the polymerase domain and can show ATPase activity in close proximity to ssDNA. Pol ν (nu) is considered to be the least effective of the polymerase enzymes. However, DNA polymerase nu plays an active role in homology repair during cellular responses to crosslinks, fulfilling its role in a complex with helicase.

Plants use two Family A polymerases to copy both the mitochondrial and plastid genomes. They are more similar to bacterial Pol I than they are to mammalian Pol γ.

====Reverse transcriptase====
Retroviruses encode an unusual DNA polymerase called reverse transcriptase, which is an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (RdDp) that synthesizes DNA from a template of RNA. The reverse transcriptase family contain both DNA polymerase functionality and RNase H functionality, which degrades RNA base-paired to DNA. An example of a retrovirus is HIV. Reverse transcriptase is commonly employed in amplification of RNA for research purposes. Using an RNA template, PCR can utilize reverse transcriptase, creating a DNA template. This new DNA template can then be used for typical PCR amplification. The products of such an experiment are thus amplified PCR products from RNA.

Each HIV retrovirus particle contains two RNA genomes, but, after an infection, each virus generates only one provirus. After infection, reverse transcription is accompanied by template switching between the two genome copies (copy choice recombination). From 5 to 14 recombination events per genome occur at each replication cycle. Template switching (recombination) appears to be necessary for maintaining genome integrity and as a repair mechanism for salvaging damaged genomes.

===Bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase===

Bacteriophage (phage) T4 encodes a DNA polymerase that catalyzes DNA synthesis in a 5&#x27; to 3&#x27; direction. The phage polymerase also has an exonuclease activity that acts in a 3&#x27; to 5&#x27; direction, and this activity is employed in the proofreading and editing of newly inserted bases. A phage mutant with a temperature sensitive DNA polymerase, when grown at permissive temperatures, was observed to undergo recombination at frequencies that are about two-fold higher than that of wild-type phage.

It was proposed that a mutational alteration in the phage DNA polymerase can stimulate template strand switching (copy choice recombination) during replication.

<doc id="235929" wikidata="Q297515" url="?curid=235929" title="Pomponius Mela">
<text>Pomponius Mela, who wrote around AD 43, was the earliest known Roman geographer. He was born at the end of the 1st century BC in Tingentera (now Algeciras) and died  AD 45. 

His short work (&quot;De situ orbis libri III.&quot;) remained in use nearly to the year 1500. It occupies less than one hundred pages of ordinary print, and is described by the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; (1911) as &quot;dry in style and deficient in method, but of pure Latinity, and occasionally relieved by pleasing word-pictures.&quot; Except for the geographical parts of Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Historia naturalis&quot; (where Mela is cited as an important authority), the &quot;De situ orbis&quot; is the only formal treatise on the subject in Classical Latin.

== Biography ==

Little is known of Pomponius except his name and birthplace—the small town of Tingentera or Cingentera (identified as Iulia Traducta) in southern Spain, on Algeciras Bay (Mela ii. 6, § 96; but the text is here corrupt). The date of his writing may be approximately fixed by his allusion (iii. 6 § 49) to a proposed British expedition of the reigning emperor, almost certainly that of Claudius in AD 43. That this passage cannot refer to Julius Caesar is evidenced by several references to events of Augustus&#x27;s reign; especially to certain new names given to Spanish towns. Mela, like the two Senecas, Lucan, Martial, Quintilian, Trajan, Hadrian, were all part of Italic communities settled in various parts of Spain that eventually relocated in Rome. It has been conjectured that Pomponius Mela may have been related in some way to Marcus Annaeus Mela, son of Seneca the Elder and father of Lucan.

== Geographical knowledge ==
The general views of the &quot;De situ orbis&quot; mainly agree with those current among Greek writers from Eratosthenes to Strabo; the latter was probably unknown to Mela. But Pomponius is unique among ancient geographers in that, after dividing the Earth into five zones, of which two only were habitable, he asserts the existence of antichthones, inhabiting the southern temperate zone inaccessible to the folk of the northern temperate regions from the unbearable heat of the intervening torrid belt. On the divisions and boundaries of Europe, Asia and Africa, he repeats Eratosthenes; like all classical geographers from Alexander the Great (except Ptolemy) he regards the Caspian Sea as an inlet of the Northern Ocean, corresponding to the Persian and Arabian (Red Sea) gulfs on the south.
His Indian conceptions are inferior to those of some earlier Greek writers; he follows Eratosthenes in supposing that country to occupy the south-eastern angle of Asia, whence the coast trended northwards to Scythia, and then swept round westward to the Caspian Sea. As usual, he places the Riphean Mountains and the Hyperboreans near the Scythian Ocean. In western Europe his knowledge (as was natural in a Spanish subject of Imperial Rome) was somewhat in advance of the Greek geographers. He defines the western coast-line of Spain and Gaul and its indentation by the Bay of Biscay more accurately than Eratosthenes or Strabo, his ideas of the British Isles and their position are also clearer than his predecessors. He is the first to name the Orcades or Orkney Islands, which he defines and locates pretty correctly. Of northern Europe his knowledge was imperfect, but he speaks of a great bay (&quot;Codanus sinus&quot;) to the north of Germany, among whose many islands was one, &quot;Codanovia&quot;, of pre-eminent size; this name reappears in Pliny the Elder&#x27;s work as &quot;Scatinavia&quot;. &quot;Codanovia&quot; and &quot;Scatinavia&quot; were both Latin renderings of the Proto-Germanic *&quot;Skaðinawio&quot;, the Germanic name for Scandinavia.

=== Descriptive method ===
Mela&#x27;s descriptive method follows ocean coasts, in the manner of a periplus, probably because it was derived from the accounts of navigators. He begins at the Straits of Gibraltar, and describes the countries adjoining the south coast of the Mediterranean; then he moves round by Syria and Asia Minor to the Black Sea, and so returns to Spain along the north shore of the Euxine, Propontis, etc. After treating the Mediterranean islands, he next takes the ocean littoral—to west, north, east and south successively—from Spain and Gaul round to India, from India to Persia, Arabia and Ethiopia; and so again works back to Spain. Like most classical geographers he conceives of the continent of Africa as surrounded by sea and not extending very far south.

== Editions ==

The &quot;editio princeps&quot; of Mela was published at Milan in 1471; the first critical edition was by Joachim Vadian (Wien, 1518), superseded by those of Johann Heinrich Voss (1658), Johann Friedrich Gronovius (1685 and 1696), A. Gronovius (1722 and 1728), and Tzschucke (1806–1807), in seven parts (Leipzig; the most elaborate of all); G. Paithey&#x27;s (Berlin, 1867) for its text. The English translation by Arthur Golding (1585) was celebrated.

A recent English translation is that of F. E. Romer, originally published in 1998.

<doc id="235935" wikidata="Q407828" url="?curid=235935" title="Topoisomerase">
<text>DNA topoisomerases (or topoisomerases) are enzymes that catalyze changes in the topological state of DNA, interconverting relaxed and supercoiled forms, linked (catenated) and unlinked species, and knotted and unknotted DNA. Topological issues in DNA arise due to the intertwined nature of its double-helical structure, which, for example, can lead to overwinding of the DNA duplex during DNA replication and transcription. If left unchanged, this torsion would eventually stop the DNA or RNA polymerases involved in these processes from continuing along the DNA helix. A second topological challenge results from the linking or tangling of DNA during replication. Left unresolved, links between replicated DNA will impede cell division. The DNA topoisomerases prevent and correct these types of topological problems. They do this by binding to DNA and cutting the sugar-phosphate backbone of either one (type I topoisomerases) or both (type II topoisomerases) of the DNA strands. This transient break allows the DNA to be untangled or unwound, and, at the end of these processes, the DNA backbone is resealed. Since the overall chemical composition and connectivity of the DNA do not change, the DNA substrate and product are chemical isomers, differing only in their topology.

== Discovery ==

The first DNA topoisomerase was discovered in bacteria by James C. Wang in 1971 and was initially named ω (omega) protein; it is now called &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; (&quot;E. coli&quot;) topoisomerase I (topo I) and is a representative of the type IA family of enzymes. Subsequently, a similar activity was found in eukaryotic cells (rat liver) by James Champoux and Renato Dulbecco; the enzyme responsible, eukaryotic topo I, has a distinct mechanism and is representative of the type IB family. The first type II topoisomerase to be discovered was DNA gyrase from bacteria, by Martin Gellert and coworkers in 1976, and also characterized by Nicholas Cozzarelli and co-workers. DNA gyrase catalyzes the introduction of negative supercoils into DNA and is the only type II enzyme to do this, all the others catalyze DNA relaxation. Type II enzymes are mechanistically distinct from type I in being ATP-dependent and transiently cleaving both DNA strands rather than just one. Type II topoisomerases were subsequently identified from bacterial viruses and eukaryotes. Topo EC-codes are as follows: ATP-independent (type I), EC 5.6.2.1; ATP-dependent (type II): EC 5.6.2.2. The exception among the type I topoisomerases, reverse gyrase, which contains a helicase domain (EC 3.6.4.12) and introduces positive supercoiling in an ATP-dependent manner. Therefore it is the sole type I topoisomerase classified as EC 5.6.2.2 (Table 1).

== DNA topology ==
The double-helical structure of DNA involves the intertwining of the two polynucleotide strands around each other, which potentially gives rise to topological problems. DNA topology refers to the crossing of the two DNA strands that alters the twist of the double helix and gives rise to tertiary conformations of DNA, such as supercoils, knots and catenanes. Potential topological issues associated with the double-helical structure of DNA were recognized soon after its structure was first elucidated in 1953 by James Watson, Francis Crick and Rosalind Franklin and developed further by the work of Max Delbruck and John Cairns. Closed-circular double-stranded DNA can be described by 3 parameters: Linking number (Lk), Twist (Tw) and Writhe (Wr) (Fig. 1). Where Lk refers to the number of times the two strands are linked, Tw refers to the number of helical turns in the DNA, measured relative to the helical axis, and Wr quantifies the coiling of the path of the DNA helix in space and is often equated with &#x27;supercoiling&#x27;.

The 3 parameters are related as follows: Lk = Tw +Wr. This is a mathematical identity originally obtained by Călugăreanu in 1959 and is referred to as the Călugăreanu, or Călugăreanu–White–Fuller, theorem. Lk cannot be altered without breaking one or both strands of the helix; Tw and Wr are interconvertible and depend upon the solution conditions. Supercoiling is a vernacular term for DNA with a non-zero linking difference, more correctly referred to as specific linking difference (σ = ΔLk/Lk0, where Lk0 is the mean linking number of the relaxed DNA circle). DNA is said to be positively supercoiled if Lk of it is higher than Lk0 for the relaxed state (Lk-Lko = ΔLk, ΔLk&gt;0); that means that Tw and/or Wr are increased relative to the relaxed molecule. Conversely, DNA is negatively supercoiled if Lk of the molecule is lower than the Lk0 (ΔLk&lt;0).

The consequences of topological perturbations in DNA are exemplified by DNA replication during which the strands of the duplex are separated; this separation leads to the formation of positive supercoils (DNA overwinding or overtwisting) ahead of the replication fork and intertwining of the daughter strands (precatenanes) behind (Fig. 2). If the positive supercoils are not relaxed, progression of the replication fork is impeded, whereas failure to unlink the daughter strands prevents genome segregation, which is required for cell division. Transcription by RNA polymerase also generates positive supercoiling ahead of, and negative supercoiling behind, the transcriptional complex (Fig. 2). This effect is known as the twin-supercoiled domain model, as described by Leroy Liu and James Wang in 1987. These topological perturbations must be resolved for DNA metabolism to proceed, allowing the cell to efficiently replicate, transcribe and partition the genome to enable cellular division and vitality. Knots in DNA can be found in bacteriophages and as products of recombination reactions. In general, knots in DNA are detrimental and need to be removed (by topoisomerases). DNA catenanes are formed upon the replication of circular molecules and need to be resolved by topoisomerases or recombinases to allow proper separation of daughter molecules during cell division. In addition to the detrimental aspects of DNA topology that require resolution, there are also beneficial aspects. For example, plasmid replication requires negative supercoiling of the origin, which facilitates local melting and exposes single-stranded DNA required to initiate replication. Similarly, initiation of replication from the main bacterial origin &quot;oriC&quot; also requires negative supercoiling. Furthermore, compaction of the &quot;E. coli&quot; genome is achieved in part by negative supercoiling.
== Types ==
DNA topoisomerases are enzymes that have evolved to resolve topological problems in DNA (Table 2). They do this via transient breakage of one or both strands of DNA. This has led to the classification of topos into two types: type I, which catalyze reactions involving transient single-stranded breaks, and type II, which catalyze reactions involving transient double-stranded breaks (Fig. 3; Table 2). Sub-types exist within these classifications.
=== Type I ===
These enzymes catalyze changes in DNA topology via transient single-stranded breaks in DNA. Reactions can occur on both single- and double-stranded DNA substrates and can proceed via a &#x27;swivel&#x27; or &#x27;strand-passage&#x27; mechanism (Fig. 3). The range of reactions includes: DNA supercoil relaxation, unknotting of single-stranded circles, and decatenation, provided at least one partner has a single-stranded region. In the case of the archaeal enzyme, reverse gyrase, positive supercoiling of DNA is possible.

==== Type IA ====
Type IA are monomeric and bind to single-stranded segments of DNA. They introduce a transient single-stranded break through the formation of a tyrosyl-phosphate bond between a tyrosine in the enzyme and a 5′-phosphate in the DNA. The segment of DNA within which the break occurs is called the &#x27;gate&#x27; or G-segment, and its cleavage allows the passage of another segment of DNA, the &#x27;transport&#x27; or T-segment, to be passed through in a &#x27;strand-passage&#x27; process. This is followed by ligation of the G-segment. For strand passage to occur, topo IA must undergo a conformational change to open the DNA gate and allow T-segment transfer. During a DNA relaxation reaction this process changes the linking number of the DNA by +/-1 (Fig. 4). Examples of type IA topoisomerases include prokaryotic topo I and III, eukaryotic topo IIIα and IIIβ and the archaeal enzyme reverse gyrase. Reverse gyrase, which occurs in thermophilic archaea, comprises a type IA topo coupled to a helicase, and is the only known enzyme that can introduce positive supercoils into DNA. The gene encoding reverse gyrase is also found in some groups of thermophilic bacteria, where it was likely transferred by horizontal gene transfer from Archaea.
==== Type IB ====
Type IB topoisomerases catalyze reactions involving transient single-stranded breaks in DNA through the formation of a tyrosyl-phosphate bond between a tyrosine in the enzyme and a 3′-phosphate in the DNA. Rather than utilizing a strand-passage mechanism, these enzymes operate via a &#x27;swivel&#x27; or &#x27;controlled rotation&#x27; of the cleaved strand around the intact strand. This controlled-rotation mechanism was first described for Vaccinia topo I and permits DNA rotation of the free end around the intact strand, the speed being controlled by &#x27;friction&#x27; within the enzyme cavity, before the nick is re-ligated (Fig. 3). This results in a variable change of linking number per cleavage and religation event. This mechanism is distinct from that of the type IA enzymes, and the two groups of enzymes are structurally and evolutionarily unrelated. Examples of type IB topoisomerases include eukaryotic nuclear and mitochondrial topo I in addition to viral topo I, though they have been identified in all three domains of life.

==== Type IC ====
Type IC topoisomerases share a similar mechanism to the type IB enzymes but are structurally distinct. The sole representative is topo V, found in the hyperthermophile &quot;Methanopyrus kandleri&quot;.

=== Type II ===
Type II topoisomerases catalyze changes in DNA topology via transient double-stranded breaks in DNA. Reactions occur on double-stranded DNA substrates and proceed via a strand-passage mechanism (Fig. 5). The range of reactions include DNA relaxation, DNA supercoiling, unknotting, and decatenation. Whereas all type II topoisomerases can catalyze DNA relaxation, gyrase, an archetypal bacterial topoisomerase, can also introduce negative supercoils. In contrast to type I topoisomerases that are generally monomeric, type II topoisomerases are homodimers or heterotetramers. They are classified into two subtypes based on evolutionary, structural, and mechanistic considerations. The general strand-passage mechanism for the type II topos begins with the binding of one DNA duplex, termed the gate segment (G-segment), at the DNA gate. Another duplex, termed the transport segment (T-segment), is captured by an ATP-operated clamp and passed through a transient break in the G-segment, involving 5ʹ phosphotyrosine linkages in both strands, before it is released through the C-gate and the G-segment is re-ligated (Fig. 5). Enzyme turnover requires the binding and hydrolysis of ATP.
==== Type IIA ====
Type IIA topoisomerases catalyze transient double-stranded breaks in DNA through the formation of tyrosyl-phosphate bonds between tyrosines in the enzyme (one on each subunit) and 5′-phosphates staggered by 4 bases in opposite DNA strands. The strand-passage reaction can be intra- or intermolecular (Fig. 5), thus permitting changes in supercoiling and knotting, or unlinking, respectively. This process changes the linking number of the DNA by +/-2. Examples of type IIA topoisomerases include eukaryotic topo IIα and topo IIβ, in addition to bacterial gyrase and topo IV. DNA gyrase conforms to the same double-strand passage mechanism as other type II enzymes but has unique features connected with its ability to introduce negative supercoils into DNA. The G segment is part of a much longer piece of DNA (&gt;100 bp) that is wrapped around the enzyme, one arm of which forms the T-segment that is passed through the double-stranded break (Fig. 5). In the case of gyrase, a substantial amount of the free energy from ATP hydrolysis is transduced into torsional stress in DNA, i.e. supercoiling is an energy-requiring process. Further, in the absence of ATP, gyrase is able to remove negative supercoils in a slower DNA relaxation reaction.

==== Type IIB ====
Type IIB also catalyze transient double-stranded breaks through the formation of tyrosyl-phosphate bonds between tyrosines in the enzyme and 5′-phosphates in opposite strands of the DNA, but in the case of IIB enzymes the double-stranded breaks have a 2-base stagger. Type IIB enzymes show important structural differences, but are evolutionarily related to the type IIA enzymes. These differences include the lack of one of the protein &#x27;gates&#x27; (the C gate) (Fig. 5). Originally found in archaea, they have also been found in eukaryotes, and, in particular, in plants; examples include topo VI and topo VIII. Topo VI is the best-studied enzyme of this sub-type and is thought to be a preferential decatenase.

== As drug targets ==
For the non-specialist perhaps the most important aspect of topoisomerases is their role as drug targets both for antibacterial and anti-cancer chemotherapy; several topoisomerase-targeted antibacterial and anti-cancer drugs are listed among the 2019 World Health Organization Model List of essential Medicines. The reason for this prominence is that their reactions proceed via transient breaks in DNA, which, if stabilized by drug binding, can lead to cell death due to the generation of toxic single- or double-stranded breaks in genomic DNA. The majority of topo-targeted drugs act in this way, i.e. they stabilize the enzyme-DNA covalent cleavage intermediate.

=== Antibacterial compounds ===
Although type I topos, such as bacterial topo I, are viable antibiotic targets, there are currently no compounds in clinical use that target these enzymes. However, the type II enzymes, DNA gyrase and DNA topoisomerase IV, have enjoyed enormous success as targets for the widely-used fluoroquinolone antibiotics, (Fig. 6). 

==== Fluoroquinolones (FQs) ====
Quinolone antibacterial compounds were first developed in the 1960s and have been in clinical use since the 1980s. FQ derivatives, such as ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin (Fig. 6) have been highly-successful. These compounds work by interacting with their target (gyrase or topo IV) and DNA at the cleavage site to stabilize the DNA-protein covalent cleavage intermediate. Specifically, they intercalate into the DNA and prevent the DNA religation step of the topoisomerase reaction (Fig. 5). This is a highly-effective mechanism of inhibition that is also used by several topoisomerase-targeted anti-cancer drugs. Despite their spectacular success, resistance to FQs is a serious problem. A variety of other compounds, such as quinazolinediones and imidazolpyrazinones, work in a similar manner and it is hoped that some of these will replace FQs in the future.

==== Aminocoumarins ====
Aminocoumarins (Fig. 6), such as novobiocin, clorobiocin and coumermycin A1, are natural products from Streptomyces that inhibit the ATPase reaction of gyrase and topo IV. Although they can be very potent against their target, they suffer from permeability and toxicity issues, and thus have not enjoyed the level of clinical success of the FQs.

==== Proteinaceous inhibitors ====
There are a number of protein inhibitors of gyrase, including the bacterial toxins CcdB, MccB17, and ParE, that stabilize the cleavage complex, in a similar manner to FQs. Although these proteins are not viable as antibacterials, their mode of action could inspire the development of novel antibacterial compounds. Other protein inhibitors of gyrase prevent DNA binding by the topoisomerase rather than stabilizing cleavage complexes. These include YacG and pentapeptide repeat proteins, such as QnrB1 and MfpA; these protein inhibitors also confer resistance to fluoroquinolones.
=== Anti-cancer compounds ===
Both human topo I and topo II (both α and β isoforms) can be targeted in anticancer chemotherapy (Fig. 7). Most of these compounds act in a similar way to FQs, i.e. by stabilizing the DNA-protein covalent cleavage complex; for this they have become known as topoisomerase poisons, distinct from catalytic inhibitors. Several human topoisomerase inhibitors are included on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

==== Camptothecin (CPT) ====
Camptothecin (Fig. 7), originally derived from the tree &quot;Camptotheca acuminata&quot;, targets human topo I and derivatives such as topotecan and irinotecan are widely used in cancer chemotherapy. Camptothecin and its derivatives act by stabilizing the topo I cleavage complex, preventing religation of the protein-mediated nick in the DNA. These interfacial inhibitors are stabilized by stacking interactions with the nicked DNA and hydrogen bonding to the enzyme. Although CPT derivatives stabilize a single-strand cleavage complex, subsequent collisions with replication or transcription machinery are thought to generate toxic double-stranded DNA breaks. These compounds are used as first or second line therapies to treat cancers including colorectal, ovarian, lung, breast, and cervical. However, CPT derivatives suffer from limitations associated with toxicity and limited therapeutic half-lives due to chemical instability. New topo I inhibitors, the indenoisoquinolines and fluoroindenoisoquinolines, overcome the limitations of CPT derivatives and are currently in clinical trials. 

==== Etoposide (VP-16) ====
Etoposide (Fig. 7) and its close relative teniposide (VM-26) are epipodophyllotoxin derivatives obtained from the rhizome of wild mandrake that target topo II by stabilizing the covalent cleavage complex and preventing religation of the cleaved DNA. These are typically used in conjunction with other chemotherapy drugs to treat cancers including testicular tumors, small-cell lung cancer, and leukemia. Etoposide treatment can result in secondary leukemias arising from specific genomic translocations, mainly involving topo IIβ.

==== Doxorubicin ====

Doxorubicin (Fig. 7) and the related derivatives daunorubicin, epirubicin, and idarubicin are anthracyclines obtained from the bacterium &quot;Streptomyces&quot; that target human topo II, stabilizing the cleavage complex in a similar manner to other topoisomerase poisons. Mitoxantrone is a synthetic anthracenedione that is chemically and functionally similar to anthracyclines. The anthracyclines were the first topoisomerase inhibitors used to treat cancer and remain among the most widely employed and effective treatments for a broad range of cancers including breast cancer, lymphoma, leukemias, carcinomas, sarcomas, and other tumors. These compounds are DNA intercalating agents and as such can impact a wide range of cellular DNA processes in addition to specifically poisoning topo II. Additional cytotoxicity stems from redox reactions involving anthracyclines that generate reactive oxygen species. Generation of reactive oxygen, along with poisoning of topo IIβ, result in the dose-limiting cardiotoxicity of the anthracyclines.

==== Merbarone ====
Merbarone is a thiobarbituric acid derivative, and dexrazoxane (ICRF-187), one of several related bisdioxopiperazine derivatives, (Fig. 7) are examples of catalytic inhibitors of topo II, i.e. they prevent completion of the catalytic cycle of topo II but do not stabilize the DNA cleavage complex. Whereas these catalytic inhibitors exhibit cytotoxicity and have been tested in clinical trials, they are not currently in clinical use for cancer therapy. However, dexrazoxane, which blocks ATP hydrolysis by topo II, is used to prevent cardiotoxicity associated with the anthracyclines.

==Role of topoisomerase in transcriptional regulation==

At least one topoisomerase, DNA topoisomerase II beta (topo IIβ), has a regulatory role in gene transcription. Topo IIβ–dependent double-strand DNA breaks and components of the DNA damage repair machinery are important for rapid expression of immediate early genes, as well as for signal-responsive gene regulation. Topo IIβ, with other associated enzymes, appears to be important for the release of paused RNA polymerase at highly transcribed or long genes.

===Topo IIβ in initiation of transcription===

Stimulus-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that are limited to a short-term (10 minutes to 2 hours) are induced by topo IIβ in the promoter regions of signal-regulated genes. These DSBs allow rapid up-regulation of expression of such signal responsive genes in a number of systems (see Table below). These signal-regulated genes include genes activated in response to stimulation with estrogen, serum, insulin, glucocorticoids (such as dexamethasone) and activation of neurons. When the induced DNA double-strand break has been repaired, then transcription of the signal-responsive gene returns to a low basal level.

Topo IIβ and PARP-1 were found to be constitutively present at a moderate level near the transcription start site of a promoter of a signal-responsive gene. After the signal occurred, topo IIβ caused a double-strand break and PARP-1 was involved in replacing histone H1 by HMGB1/HMGA2, which can promote transcription. Topo IIβ and PARP-1 increased at the site of the double-strand break and components of the non-homologous end joining DNA repair pathway, including DNA-PKcs, Ku70/Ku80 and DNA ligase IV assembled with topo IIβ and PARP-1. This assemblage was all present at the linker DNA adjacent to a single nucleosome in the promoter region of a gene (see Figure). The nucleosome was close to the transcription start site of the gene. The components of the non-homologous end joining DNA repair pathway were essential to the closing of the DNA double-strand break.

===Topo IIβ regulation of gene expression===

RNA polymerase II frequently has a pausing site that is about 30–60 nucleotides downstream of
the transcription start site of a gene. The pausing of RNA polymerase II at these sites and the controlled release of the pausing is thought to have a regulatory role in gene transcription. As pointed out by Singh et al., &quot;about 80% of highly expressed genes in HeLa cells are paused&quot;. Very short-term, but not immediately resealed, topo IIβ-induced DNA double-strand breaks occur at sites of RNA polymerase II pausing, and appear to be required for efficient release of the paused state and progression to gene transcription. For the genes at which it occurs, the DNA double-stranded break induced by TOP2B is thought to be part of the process of regulation of gene expression.

<text>Johann Friedrich Gronovius (the Latinized form of Gronow; 8 September 1611 – 28 December 1671) was a German classical scholar, librarian and critic.

Born in Hamburg, he studied at several universities and travelled in England, France and Italy. In 1643, he was appointed professor of rhetoric and history at Deventer, and in 1658 to the Greek chair at Leiden, where he remained until his death. In 1665, Gronovius succeeded Antonius Thysius the Younger as the 6th Librarian of Leiden University (see also Raffaello Fabretti).

Gronovius edited and annotated Statius, Plautus, Livy, Tacitus, Aulus Gellius and Seneca&#x27;s tragedies. In addition, he was the author of &quot;Commentarius de sestertiis&quot; (1643) and of an edition of Hugo Grotius&#x27;s &quot;De jure belli et pacis&quot; (1660), amongst numerous other works. His &quot;Observationes&quot; contain a number of brilliant emendations. His son Jakob Gronovius was also a classical scholar.

Johann Friedrich Gronovius died in Leiden in 1671.

<text>Raphael Fabretti (1618 – 7 January 1700) was an Italian antiquarian.

== Life and works ==
Born at Urbino in the Marche, he studied law at Cagli and Urbino, where he took his doctorate at the age of eighteen. While in Rome he attracted the notice of Cardinal Lorenzo Imperiali, who employed him successively as treasurer and auditor of the papal legation in Spain, where he remained thirteen years. Meanwhile, his favourite classical and antiquarian studies were not neglected; and on his return journey he made important observations of the relics and monuments of Spain, France, and Italy.

At Rome he was appointed judge of appellation of the Capitol, but left to be auditor of the legation at Urbino. After three years he returned to Rome, on the invitation of Cardinal Gaspare Carpegna, vicar of Pope Innocent XI, and devoted himself to antiquarian research, examining with minute care the monuments and inscriptions of the Campagna. He always rode a horse which his friends nicknamed &quot;Marco Polo&quot;, after the Venetian traveller. Pope Innocent XII made him keeper of the archives of the Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo, a charge he retained until his death. His collection of inscriptions and monuments was purchased by Cardinal Giovanni Francesco Stoppani, and placed in the ducal palace at Urbino, where they may still be seen.

His work &quot;De Aquis et Aquaeductibus veteris Romae&quot; (1680), three dissertations on the topography of ancient Latium, is inserted in Graevius&#x27;s &quot;Thesaurus&quot;, iv (1677). His interpretation of certain passages in Livy and other classical authors involved him in a dispute with Gronovius, which bore a strong resemblance to that between John Milton and Claudius Salmasius, Gronovius addressing Fabretti as Faber Rusticus, and the latter, in reply, speaking of Gronovius and his &quot;titivilitia&quot;. In this controversy Fabretti used the pseudonym &quot;Iasitheus&quot;, which he afterwards took as his pastoral name in the Academy of the Arcadians.

His other works, &quot;De Columna Trajani Syntagma&quot; (1683), and &quot;Inscriptionum Antiquarum Explicatio&quot; (1699), throw much light on Roman antiquity. In the former is to be found his explication of an early Imperial Roman bas-relief, with inscriptions, now in the Capitol at Rome, representing the war and taking of Troy, one of the &quot;Tabulae Iliacae&quot;. Letters and other shorter works of Fabretti are to be found in publications of the time, such as the &quot;Journal des Savants&quot;.

Their main application is in dairy and meat products, due to their strong binding to food proteins. Carrageenans have emerged as a promising candidate in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications as they resemble animal glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). They are used for tissue engineering, wound coverage, and drug delivery.

Carrageenans contain 15–40% ester-sulfate content, which makes them anionic polysaccharides. They can be mainly categorized into three classes based on their sulfate content. Kappa-carrageenan has one sulfate group per disaccharide, iota-carrageenan has two, and lambda-carrageenan has three.

A common seaweed used for manufacturing the hydrophilic colloids to produce carrageenan is &quot;Chondrus crispus&quot; (Irish moss), which is a dark red, parsley-like alga that grows attached to rocks. Gelatinous extracts of &quot;C. crispus&quot; have been used as food additives since approximately the fifteenth century. Carrageenan is a vegetarian and vegan alternative to gelatin in some applications, and is used to replace gelatin in confectionery and other food.

The first industrial commercial cultivation of &quot;Eucheuma&quot; and &quot;Kappaphycus&quot; spp. for carrageenan was developed in the Philippines. The global top producers of carrageenan are the Philippines and Indonesia. Carrageenan, along with agar, is used to produce traditional jelly desserts in the Philippines called &quot;gulaman&quot;.

No clinical evidence establishes carrageenan as an unsafe food ingredient, mainly because its fate after digestion is inadequately determined.

== Properties ==
Carrageenans are large, highly flexible molecules that form curling helical structures. This gives them the ability to form a variety of different gels at room temperature. They are widely used in the food and other industries as thickening and stabilizing agents.

All carrageenans are high-molecular-weight polysaccharides and mainly made up of alternating 3-linked β-D-galactopyranose (G-units) and 4-linked α-D-galactopyranose (D-units) or 4-linked 3,6-anhydro-α-D-galactopyranose (DA-units), forming the disaccharide repeating unit of carrageenans.

There are three main commercial classes of carrageenan:

* &quot;Kappa&quot; forms strong, rigid gels in the presence of potassium ions, and reacts with dairy proteins. It is sourced mainly from &quot;Kappaphycus alvarezii&quot;.
* &quot;Iota&quot; forms soft gels in the presence of calcium ions. It is produced mainly from &quot;Eucheuma denticulatum&quot;.
* &quot;Lambda&quot; does not gel, and is used to thicken dairy products.

The primary differences that influence the properties of kappa, iota, and lambda carrageenan are the number and position of the ester sulfate groups on the repeating galactose units. Higher levels of ester sulfate lower the solubility temperature of the carrageenan and produce lower strength gels, or contribute to gel inhibition (lambda carrageenan).

Many red algal species produce different types of carrageenans during their developmental history. For instance, the genus &quot;Gigartina&quot; produces mainly kappa carrageenans during its gametophytic stage, and lambda carrageenans during its sporophytic stage. All are soluble in hot water, but in cold water, only the lambda form (and the sodium salts of the other two) are soluble.

When used in food products, carrageenan has the EU additive E numbers E407 or E407a when present as &quot;processed eucheuma seaweed&quot;. Technically carrageenan is considered a dietary fibre.

In parts of Scotland and Ireland, where it is known by a variety of local and native names, &quot;Chondrus crispus&quot; is boiled in milk and strained, before sugar and other flavourings such as vanilla, cinnamon, brandy, or whisky are added. The end-product is a kind of jelly similar to panna cotta, tapioca, or blancmange.

== Production ==

Although carrageenans were introduced on an industrial scale in the 1930s, they were known to be used in China since around 600 BC (where &quot;Gigartina&quot; was used) and in Ireland around 400 AD.

Carrageenan derived from &quot;Eucheuma&quot; spp. (today one of the main cultivated sources of carrageenan), known as &quot;gusô&quot; or &quot;tambalang&quot; in the Visayan languages, has also been traditionally used as food in the Philippines. They were first recorded in the &quot;Diccionario De La Lengua Bisaya, Hiligueina y Haraia de la isla de Panay y Sugbu y para las demas islas&quot; (c.1637) of the Augustinian missionary Alonso de Méntrida . In the book, Méntrida describes gusô as being cooked until it melts, and then allowed to congeal into a sour dish.

The most commonly used sources are &quot;Eucheuma cottonii&quot;, &quot;Kappaphycus alvarezii&quot;, and &quot;Eucheuma spinosum&quot;, which together provide about three-quarters of the world production. These grow from the sea surface to a depth of about . The seaweed is normally grown on nylon lines strung between bamboo floats, and it is harvested after three months or so, when each plant weighs approximately .

After harvest, the seaweed is dried, baled, and sent to the carrageenan manufacturer. There the seaweed is ground, sifted to remove impurities such as sand, and washed thoroughly. After treatment with hot alkali solution (e.g., 5–8% potassium hydroxide), the cellulose is removed from the carrageenan by centrifugation and filtration. The resulting carrageenan solution is then concentrated by evaporation. It is dried and ground to specification.

There are three types of industrial processing:

===Semi-refined===

This is only produced from &quot;E. cottonii&quot; or &quot;E. spinosum&quot;. The raw weed is first sorted and crude contaminants are removed by hand. The weed is then washed to remove salt and sand, and then cooked in hot alkali to increase the gel strength. The cooked weed is washed, dried, and milled. &quot;E. spinosum&quot; undergoes a much milder cooking cycle, as it dissolves quite readily. The product is called semi-refined carrageenan, Philippines natural grade, or, in the U.S., it simply falls under the common carrageenan specification.

===Refined===
The essential difference in the refining process is that the carrageenan is first dissolved and filtered to remove cell wall debris. The carrageenan is then precipitated from the clear solution, either by isopropyl alcohol (propan-2-ol) or by potassium chloride.

===Mixed processing===
A hybrid technology in which seaweed is treated heterogeneously as in the semirefined process exists, but alcohol or high salt levels are used to inhibit dissolution. This process is often used on South American seaweeds and gives some of the cost benefits of semirefined processing, while allowing a wider range of seaweeds to be processed, however, the naturally low cellulose levels in some South American seaweeds allow them to be heterogeneously processed and still be sold under the EU refined specification.

=== Grades ===

There are two basic grades of carrageenan, refined (RC) and semi-refined (SRC). The latter is also known as &quot;processed &quot;Eucheuma&quot; seaweed&quot; (PES) and &quot;Philippine natural grade&quot; (PNG) carrageenan. In the European Union, refined carrageenan is designated by the E number E-407 and semi-refined carrageenan as E-407a. Refined carrageenan has a 2% maximum for acid-insoluble material and is produced by alcohol precipitation or potassium chloride gel press process. Semi-refined carrageenan has a much higher cellulose content and is produced in a less complex process. Indonesia, the Philippines, and Chile are three main sources of raw material and extracted carrageenan.

== Uses and applications ==
===Food and other domestic uses===
* Desserts, ice cream, cream, milkshakes, yogurts, salad dressings, sweetened condensed milks
* Sauces: to increase viscosity
* Beer: clarifier to remove haze-causing proteins
* Pâtés and processed meats (e.g., ham): substitute for fat, increase water retention, increase volume, or improve slicing
* Soy milk and other plant milks: to thicken
* Diet sodas: to enhance texture and suspend flavours
* Pet food
* Toothpaste: stabilizer to prevent constituents separating
* Vegetarian hot dogs
* Shampoo and cosmetic creams: thickener
* Personal lubricants
* Air freshener gels
* Fire fighting foam: thickener to cause foam to become sticky
* Marbling: the ancient art of paper and fabric marbling uses a carrageenan mixture on which to float paints or inks; the paper or fabric is then laid on it, absorbing the colours
* Shoe polish: to increase viscosity
* Biotechnology: to immobilize cells and enzymes
* Pharmaceuticals: used as an inactive excipient in pills and tablets

== Regulatory status ==
In the U.S., carrageenan is allowed under FDA regulations as a direct food additive and is generally regarded as safe when used as an emulsifier, stabilizer, or thickener in foods, except those standardized foods that do not provide for such use. FDA reviewed carrageenan safety for infant formula. The European Food Safety Authority concluded &quot;there is no evidence of any adverse effects in humans from exposure to food-grade carrageenan, or that exposure to degraded carrageenan from use of food-grade carrageenan is occurring&quot;. The Joint FAO/WHO expert committee on food additives stated in a July 2014 review &quot;that the use of carrageenan in infant formula or formula for special medical purposes at concentrations up to 1000 mg/L is not of concern&quot;.

Although the US National Organic Program (NOP) added carrageenan to its National List of additives allowed to be included in organic foods in 2003, and reauthorized it in 2008, noting it as &quot;critical to organic production and handling operations&quot;, on November 18, 2016, the NOP&#x27;s National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) voted to recommend carrageenan be removed from the National List. On April 4, 2018, the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) (USDA) announced the renewal of carrageenan on the National List, allowing its continued use in food products. The document states,The NOSB recommended removing carrageenan because they determined that alternative materials, such as gellan gum, guar gum, or xanthan gum, are available for use in organic products ... AMS found sufficient evidence in public comments to the NOSB that carrageenan continues to be necessary for handling agricultural products because of the unavailability of wholly natural substitutes (§ 6517(c)(1)(ii)). Carrageenan has specific uses in an array of agricultural products, and public comments reported that potential substitutes do not adequately replicate the functions of carrageenan across the broad scope of use. Therefore, carrageenan continues to meet the OFPA criteria for inclusion on the National List.The use of carrageenan in infant formula is prohibited in the EU for precautionary reasons, but is permitted in other food items. In 2018, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reported that safety of carrageenan in food products is based 75 mg/kg body weight per day.

In the UK, the Food Standards Agency issued a product recall for sweets containing carrageenan, stating that carrageenan &quot;is not permitted as an ingredient in jelly confectionery products as it presents a choking hazard&quot;.

In a 2015 review, the Joint Expert Committee of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and World Health Organization on Food Additives reported on the use of carrageenan in infant formula stating that the additive was &quot;not of concern&quot; as food for special medical purposes at concentrations up to 1000 milligrams per litre.

== Toxicity research ==

In 2018, carrageenan was deemed non-toxic by the EFSA under certain consumption levels (75 mg/kg of body weight per day), although further research was recommended, mainly focused on the fate of carrageenan during and after digestion, and on any subsequent metabolites.

Research has been done into the role of carrageenan in various forms of inflammatory bowel disease and allergic reactions, with much of the concern centered around the specific α-D-Gal-(1→3)-D-Gal glycosidic bond present in carrageenan, which interacts as an epitope with TLR4 in cultivated human epithelial cells of the mucous membrane; this is linked to alpha-gal syndrome. Other mechanisms of carrageenan-induced inflammation have also been proposed.

<doc id="235952" wikidata="Q3910" url="?curid=235952" title="Albert II, Prince of Monaco">
<text>Albert II (Albert Alexandre Louis Pierre Grimaldi; born 14 March 1958) is Prince of Monaco, reigning since 2005.

Born at the Prince&#x27;s Palace of Monaco, Albert is the second child and only son of Prince Rainier III and Princess Grace. He attended the Lycée Albert Premier before studying political science at Amherst College. In his youth, he competed in bobsleigh during Winter Olympic finals before retiring in 2002. Albert was appointed regent in March 2005 after his father fell ill, and became sovereign prince upon the latter&#x27;s death a week later. Since his accession, he has been outspoken in the field of environmentalism and an advocate of ocean conservation, and adoption of renewable energy sources to tackle global climate change, and founded Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation in 2006, to directly raise funds and initiate action for such causes and greater ecological preservation.

With assets valued in 2010 at US$1 billion, Albert owns shares in the Société des Bains de Mer, which operates Monaco&#x27;s casino and other entertainment properties in the Principality. In July 2011, Prince Albert married South African Olympic swimmer Charlene Wittstock. He has four children, 2 of them illegitimate, the other 2 legitimate: Jazmin, Alexandre Grimaldi-Coste, Gabriella, and Jacques.

==Early life==
Prince Albert was born in the Prince&#x27;s Palace of Monaco on 14 March 1958, as the second child of Prince Rainier III and Princess Grace. At the time of his birth, he was heir apparent to the throne. Albert was a dual citizen of both the Principality of Monaco and the United States of America by birth, before renouncing his American citizenship in his early adulthood. He was baptized on 20 April 1958, by Monsignor Jean Delay, Archbishop of Marseille, in the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception of Monaco. His godparents were Prince Louis de Polignac and Queen Victoria Eugenie of Spain.

==Hereditary Prince==
===Military service===
Albert spent a year training in princely duties before enrolling at Amherst College, in Massachusetts, in 1977 as Albert Grimaldi. He joined Chi Psi fraternity and lived in the Alpha Chi Lodge. Albert spent mid-1979 touring Europe and the Middle East with the Amherst College Glee Club, and also undertook an exchange program with the University of Bristol, at the Alfred Marshall School of Economics and Management, in 1979. He graduated in 1981 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science. He speaks French, German, Italian, and English. From September 1981 to April 1982, Albert trained on board the French Navy&#x27;s helicopter cruiser , attaining the rank of Ship-of-the-Line Ensign (2nd class), and is currently a reserve Lieutenant Commander. From 1983 to 1985, he took training courses with companies J.P. Morgan &amp; Co, Louis Vuitton, Rogers &amp; Wells, and Wells, Rich and Greene in the United States and Europe, studying financial management, communication, and marketing. Since May 1993, the Prince has led the Monegasque delegation to the General Assembly of the United Nations. In 2004, the Prince presided over the delegation of Monaco in Strasbourg, France, for the official accession of the Principality onto the Council of Europe.

Prince Albert&#x27;s mother, Princess Grace, died at age 52 as a result of injuries sustained in a car accident in 1982. In 2017, the Prince stated during an interview that his mother&#x27;s death was a traumatic event for him and his family, revealing that his father was &quot;never the same man&quot; after the loss.

===Sports career===
Albert was an enthusiastic sportsman, participating in cross country, javelin throwing, handball, judo, swimming, tennis, rowing, sailing, skiing, squash and fencing. He became a judo black belt in 1985.

Albert competed in the bobsleigh at five consecutive Winter Olympics for Monaco, taking part in both the two-man and four-man events. In the two-man bobsleigh Albert finished 25th at the 1988 games in Calgary, 43rd at the 1992 games in Albertville, and 31st at the 1994 games. In the four-man bobsleigh Albert finished 27th in 1992, 26th at the 1994 games in Lillehammer, and 28th at both the 1998 games in Nagano and the 2002 games in Salt Lake City. Albert was Monaco&#x27;s flag bearer at the 1988, 1994, and 1998 Winter Olympics. He also took part in the 1985 Paris–Dakar Rally, but did not complete it. Albert has been a member of the International Olympic Committee since 1985, and his maternal grandfather, John B. Kelly Sr., and maternal uncle, John B. Kelly Jr., were both Olympic medalists in rowing. In 2017 Albert gained OLY post-nominal status under his competition name of Albert Grimaldi.

On 31 March 2005, following consultation with the Crown Council of Monaco, the Palais Princier announced that Albert would take over the duties of his father as regent since Rainier was no longer able to exercise his princely functions.

==Reign==
===Accession===
The first part of Prince Albert II&#x27;s enthronement as ruler of the Principality was on 12 July 2005, after the end of the three-month mourning period for his father. A morning Mass at Saint Nicholas Cathedral presided over by the Archbishop of Monaco, the Most Reverend Bernard Barsi, formally marked the beginning of his reign. Afterward, Albert returned to the Palace to host a garden party for 7,000 Monégasques born in the Principality. In the courtyard, the Prince was presented with two keys of the city as a symbol of his investiture, and subsequently gave a speech. The evening ended with a fireworks display on the waterfront.

The second part of his investiture took place on 19 November 2005. Albert was enthroned at Saint Nicholas Cathedral. The Princely family was in attendance, including his elder sister, Princess Caroline with her husband Ernst, Prince of Hanover and three of her four children, Andrea, Pierre and Charlotte; as well as his younger sister Princess Stéphanie, his paternal aunt Princess Antoinette, Baroness of Massy, his godson, Jean-Léonard Taubert de Massy, and his cousin Elisabeth-Anne de Massy. Royalty from 16 delegations were present for the festivities throughout the country. The evening ended with a dedicated performance at the Opéra de Monte-Carlo.

===Succession issues===
As Rainier III&#x27;s health declined, Albert&#x27;s lack of legitimate children became a matter of public and political concern owing to the legal and international consequences. Had Prince Albert succeeded his father and died without lawful heirs, it would have triggered Article 3 of the 1918 Franco-Monegasque Treaty, according to which the Principality of Monaco would become a protectorate of the French Republic. Prior to 2002, Monaco&#x27;s constitution stipulated that only the last reigning prince&#x27;s &quot;direct and legitimate&quot; descendants could inherit the crown.

On 2 April 2002, Monaco promulgated Princely Law 1.249, which provides that if a reigning prince dies without surviving legitimate issue, the throne passes to his legitimate siblings and their legitimate descendants of both sexes, according to the principle of male-preference primogeniture.

Under the current constitution, neither Jazmin nor Alexandre are in the line of succession to the Monegasque throne as they are not Prince Albert II&#x27;s legitimate children, and he emphasised their ineligibility to inherit the throne in statements confirming his paternity. Monegasque law stipulates that any non-adulterine illegitimate child is legitimised by the eventual marriage of his/her parents, thereupon obtaining the rights to which that child would have been entitled if born in lawful marriage. Thus Alexandre would have become Monaco&#x27;s heir apparent under current law if Albert were to marry Alexandre&#x27;s mother. In a 2005 exchange with American reporter Larry King, Albert stated that this would not happen.

Prior to the birth of Princess Gabriella and Prince Jacques, Prince Albert&#x27;s elder sister, Caroline, Princess of Hanover, was heir presumptive and, according to the Grimaldi house law, bore the traditional title of Hereditary Princess of Monaco. Following their births, she is now third in line.

===Princely activities===
In the early years of his reign, Prince Albert oversaw multiple judicial and legal reforms, including the regulation of custody, protections of the privacy of the individual in the face of technological growth, freedom of the press, legislative gender equality, and the protection of children&#x27;s rights and disabled students. In July 2005, in echo of Albert I, his great-great-grandfather, he travelled to Spitsbergen, Norway. During this trip, he visited the glaciers Lilliehöökbreen and Monacobreen. Prince Albert also engaged in a Russian Arctic expedition, reaching the North Pole on Easter, 16 April 2006.

Since his ascension, the Prince has overseen the construction of various community facilities, including social housing, railway infrastructure, educational institutes for the hospitality industry, and secondary education. He currently heads an initiative to promote ethical economic activity, criminal liability, the adopting of systems to combat money laundering and organized crime, and the introduction of tax fraud into Monegasque criminal law. In 2006, Prince Albert created the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation, which continues Monaco&#x27;s commitment to supporting sustainable and ethical projects around the world. The foundation&#x27;s focus has three main objectives: climate change and renewable energy development, combating the loss of biodiversity, and improving universal access to clean water. In July 2011, Albert married South African Olympic swimmer Charlene Wittstock.

On 27 August 2015, Prince Albert apologized for Monaco&#x27;s role in facilitating the deportation of a total of 90 Jews and resistance fighters to the Nazis in 1942, of whom only nine survived. &quot;We committed the irreparable in handing over to the neighboring authorities women, men, and a child who had taken refuge with us to escape the persecutions they had suffered in France,&quot; Albert said at a ceremony in which a monument to the victims was unveiled at the Monaco Cemetery. &quot;In distress, they came specifically to take shelter with us, thinking they would find neutrality.&quot;

Between 2006 and 2022, Albert&#x27;s chief of cabinet was Georges Lisimachio. In June 2023, Albert dismissed Claude Palmero, the manager of the Prince of Monaco&#x27;s assets who had been serving for over two decades. Albert said of the decision, &quot;I exercised my right to choose the asset manager of my choice. Events have shown how much this decision was the right one.&quot; Palmero proceeded to sue Albert for €1 million and leaked information of the palace&#x27;s spending to the French media.

==Personal life==
In 2016, Albert purchased Princess Grace&#x27;s childhood home in East Falls, Philadelphia, which was originally built by her father Jack Kelly Sr.. Upon acquiring it, he stated the house might be used as a museum space or as offices for the Princess Grace Foundation. Prince Albert does not have direct ownership of the Prince&#x27;s Palace, but does possess personal homes in both La Turbie and Marchais.

Albert, a well-known automotive enthusiast, owns vehicles like the BMW Hydrogen 7, the Lexus LS 600h, the Lexus RX 400h, and the Toyota Prius PHV. He also owns a Dassault Aviation Falcon 7X, a 14-passenger leisure jet, currently stationed at Nice Côte d&#x27;Azur Airport.

Albert was close friends with the artist Nall and owns some of his works.

On 19 March 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, it was announced that Albert II had tested positive for COVID-19, making him the first monarch and head of state to have contracted COVID-19. It was reported that he had begun to self-quarantine from within his apartment, performing his work and duties from there. On 31 March, it was announced that he had made a full recovery. In April 2022, he tested positive for COVID-19 for the second time and observed a brief period of self-isolation.

In 2021, Raphaël Domjan became the first pilot of an electric plane flight with a head of state. On 14 September 2021, they took off with a Pipistrel Velis128 operated by Elektropostal from Nice airport in France with Albert II and they flew over Monaco. The plane flew for 30 minutes at a maximum altitude of 900 feet.

===Paternity claims===
* Tamara Jean Rotolo — Prince Albert was reportedly listed as the father of Jazmin Grace Grimaldi on her birth certificate, registered in Riverside County, California, United States. The case went to trial in 1993 and was eventually dismissed by Superior Court Judge Graham Anderson Cribbs, who refused jurisdiction and found that there was &quot;insufficient connection between [Prince Hereditary] Albert and the State of California to justify hearing a suit [in California]&quot;, justifying the statements of the Prince&#x27;s lawyer. On 31 May 2006, after a DNA test confirmed the child&#x27;s parentage, Albert admitted, via statement from his lawyer, that he is Jazmin&#x27;s father.
* Nicole Coste — In May 2005, a former Air France flight attendant from Togo claimed that her youngest son, born Éric Alexandre Stéphane Tossoukpé on 24 August 2003 in Paris, France, whom she called Alexandre Coste, was Prince Albert&#x27;s child, and stated that his parentage had been proven by DNA tests requested by the Monegasque government. She further declared that the Prince had signed a notarised certificate confirming paternity, of which she had not received a copy. The &quot;Paris Match&quot; published a ten-page interview with Coste, including photographs of Albert holding and feeding the child. Coste also told the publication that she was living in the Prince&#x27;s Paris apartment, and receiving an allowance from him, while pretending to be the girlfriend of one of his friends in order to maintain discretion. She also stated that the prince had previously last seen the boy in February 2005. The prince&#x27;s lawyer, Thierry Lacoste, announced that as a result of the international publicity over these revelations, Prince Albert was suing the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, &quot;Bunte&quot;, and &quot;Paris Match&quot; for privacy violations. On 6 July 2005, a few days before he was enthroned on 12 July, the Prince officially confirmed via his lawyer Lacoste that Alexandre was his biological son. He calls himself Alexandre Grimaldi.
* Bea Fiedler — In a suit filed around January 1989, a German model and former adult film actress claimed her son Daniel was the prince&#x27;s child from an October 1986 tryst. A judge reportedly dismissed the suit, despite the fact that Prince Albert had submitted a DNA sample to be tested, as the genetic sample had not been rendered in front of a witness. Fiedler rejected the DNA blood sample as truly belonging to the prince.
* In December 2020, a Brazilian woman filed a paternity suit against Albert, claiming that he had fathered a child with her during his relationship with Charlene. Albert&#x27;s lawyer described the claim as a &#x27;hoax&#x27;.

===Marriage===

Prince Albert met South African swimmer Charlene Wittstock in 2000 at the Mare Nostrum swimming meet in Monaco. They made their public debut as a couple at the opening ceremony of the 2006 Winter Olympics.

Their engagement was announced by the palace on 10 June 2010. The wedding was originally scheduled for 8 and 9 July 2011, but was moved forward to prevent a conflict with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) meeting in Durban on 5–9 July, which they both attended. The couple had invited members of the IOC, including president Jacques Rogge, to their wedding.

The couple were married in a civil ceremony on 1 July 2011 in the Throne Room of the Prince&#x27;s Palace. The religious ceremony took place in the courtyard of the palace on 2 July, and was presided over by Archbishop Bernard Barsi. The couple honeymooned in South Africa, where they stayed in separate hotels, and Mozambique.

Prince Albert and Princess Charlene had twins, Princess Gabriella, Countess of Carladès, and Jacques, Hereditary Prince of Monaco, on 10 December 2014. Jacques is the heir apparent to the throne.

==Charity work and patronages==

Albert holds patronages with AS Monaco, the World Olympians Association, the Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters, the Peace and Sport Organization, the No Finish Line International charitable non-profit Organisation and Junior Chamber International. He holds official and honorary presidencies within the Monaco Red Cross, Comité Olympique Monégasque, Association Mondiale des Amis de l&#x27;Enfance, The Automobile Club de Monaco, The Festival de Télévision de Monte-Carlo, and Jumping International de Monte Carlo. Albert is affiliated with International Paralympic Committee, Junior Chamber International, and Art of the Olympians. Albert is also a global adviser to Orphans International.

===Environmental Interests===
In 2001, at the 36th Congress of the Mediterranean Science Commission held in the Principality, the CIESM Member States unanimously elected Monaco in the person of Prince Albert to the presidence of the commission.

The year 2007 was declared as (International) Year of the Dolphin by the United Nations and United Nations Environment Programme. Prince Albert served as the International Patron of the &quot;Year of the Dolphin&quot;, saying &quot;The Year of the Dolphin gives me the opportunity to renew my firm commitment towards protecting marine biodiversity. With this strong initiative we can make a difference to save these fascinating marine mammals from the brink of extinction.&quot;

The Zoological Garden of Monaco (Jardin Animalier) was founded by Prince Rainier in 1954. Rainier was petitioned unsuccessfully for many years by Virginia McKenna, founder of the Born Free Foundation, to release a pair of leopards at the zoo. He intends to convert the Jardin into a zoo for children.

In January 2009, Prince Albert left for a month-long expedition to Antarctica, where he visited 26 scientific outposts and met with climate-change experts in an attempt to learn more about the impact of global warming on the continent. During the trip, he stopped at the South Pole, making him the only incumbent head of state to have visited both poles.

In June 2009, Prince Albert co-authored an op-ed published in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; with Charles Clover, the author of &quot;The End of the Line&quot;, a book about overfishing and ocean conservation issues that had recently been made into a documentary by Rupert Murray. In the piece, Prince Albert and Clover note that bluefin tuna have been severely overfished in the Mediterranean, and decry the common European Union practice of awarding inflated quotas to bluefin fleets. Albert also announced that Monaco would seek to award endangered species status to the Mediterranean bluefin, &quot;Thunnus thynnus&quot;, (also called the Northern bluefin) under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). This was the first time a nation had called for the inclusion of Mediterranean bluefin under CITES since Sweden at the 1992 CITES Conference, which was vehemently opposed by Japan who eventually threatened retaliation through trade barriers.

On 16 July 2009, France declared that it too would seek to have Mediterranean bluefin listed as an endangered species. Only hours later, the United Kingdom followed suit.

On 19 September 2017, Prince Albert expressed his great interest for the preliminary draft of the Global Pact for the Environment presented by French President Emmanuel Macron in the context of the 72nd session of the United Nations General Assembly. He added that he will be very attentive to the future of this Pact, which he qualified as a &quot;universal, legally binding agreement, which recognises the right of future generations to sustainable development.&quot;

After having met Torres Strait Islander artist and activist Alick Tipoti in 2016, Prince Albert went to stay with his family on Badu Island, and collaborated with him on the film &quot;Alick and Albert&quot; (2021), a feature-length documentary film about the future of the oceans, and how climate change affects people in the Torres Strait Islands as well as Monaco. The film had its world premiere at the Brisbane International Film Festival in October 2021.

On 12 February 2020, Albert and Victor Vescovo reached the bottom of Calypso Deep, a depth of 16,762 ft, in a submarine. They were only the second team to do so after a French group in 1965.

<doc id="235954" wikidata="Q13605872" url="?curid=235954" title="Thurston elliptization conjecture">
<text>William Thurston&#x27;s elliptization conjecture states that a closed 3-manifold with finite fundamental group is spherical, i.e. has a Riemannian metric of constant positive sectional curvature.

==Relation to other conjectures==
A 3-manifold with a Riemannian metric of constant positive sectional curvature is covered by the 3-sphere, moreover the group of covering transformations are isometries of the 3-sphere.
If the original 3-manifold had in fact a trivial fundamental group, then it is homeomorphic to the 3-sphere (via the covering map). Thus, proving the elliptization conjecture would prove the Poincaré conjecture as a corollary. In fact, the elliptization conjecture is logically equivalent to two simpler conjectures: the Poincaré conjecture and the spherical space form conjecture.

The elliptization conjecture is a special case of Thurston&#x27;s geometrization conjecture, which was proved in 2003 by G. Perelman.

<text>Disk density is a capacity designation on magnetic storage, usually floppy disks. Each designation describes a set of characteristics that can affect the areal density of a disk or the efficiency of the encoded data. Such characteristics include modulation method, track width, coercivity, and magnetic field direction.

== 8-inch media ==
&quot;Single density&quot; (SD or 1D) describes the first generation of floppy disks that use an iron oxide coating. Floppy drives utilize 300-oersted write heads, FM encoding, and a track width of for a density of 48 tracks-per-inch (tpi) and 5,876 bits-per-inch (bpi).

&quot;Double density&quot; (DD or 2D) doubles capacity over SD by replacing FM encoding with an improved line code, such as modified frequency modulation (MFM), modified modified frequency modulation (M²FM), FM/MFM or group coded recording (GCR).

== 5¼-inch media ==
&quot;SD&quot; (&quot;1D&quot;) and &quot;DD&quot; (&quot;2D&quot;) designations were generally identical to those of 8-inch disks.

&quot;Quad density&quot; (QD or 4D) doubles capacity over DD by narrowing the width of tracks to for a density of 96 tpi. Some manufacturers (Micropolis, Tandon, Micro Peripherals (MPI), Teac) used a track density of 100 tpi for quad-density drives, which were incompatible with 96 tpi models.

The Commodore 8050 and 8250 are rare instances of drives that used 375 kbit/s GCR code instead of the usual 250 kbit/s double-density format and they could store roughly 500 kilobytes on one side of a disk.

&quot;High density&quot; (HD) improves capacity by utilizing a 96 tpi track density in conjunction with improved cobalt disk coating and stronger 600-oersted write heads, allowing 9,646 bpi to be written.

== 3½-inch media ==
&quot;Double density&quot; (DD) 3½-inch disks use an iron oxide coating, just as with 5¼-inch DD/QD disks. However, drives utilize stronger 670-oersted write heads and a narrower track width of for a density of 135 tpi and 8,717 bpi.

&quot;High density&quot; (HD) 3½-inch disks switch to a cobalt disk coating, just as with 5¼-inch HD disks. Drives use 700-oersted write heads for a density of 17,434 bpi.

&quot;Extra-high density&quot; (ED) doubles the capacity over HD by using a barium ferrite coating and a special write head that allows the use of perpendicular recording.

&quot;Triple density&quot; (TD) triples the capacity over ED by tripling the track density and improving other parameters. The drives used longitudinal recording.

<doc id="235956" wikidata="Q605328" url="?curid=235956" title="Claudius Salmasius">
<text>Claude Saumaise (15 April 1588 – 3 September 1653), also known by the Latin name Claudius Salmasius, was a French classical scholar.

==Life==
Salmasius was born at Semur-en-Auxois in Burgundy. When Salmasius was sixteen, his father - a counsellor of the parlement of Dijon - sent him to Paris, where he became intimate with Isaac Casaubon (1559–1614). In 1606 he went to the University of Heidelberg, where he studied under the jurist Denis Godefroy, and devoted himself to the classics, influenced by the librarian Jan Gruter. Here he embraced Protestantism, the religion of his mother.

Returning to Burgundy, Salmasius qualified for the succession to his father&#x27;s post, which he eventually lost on account of his religion. In 1623 he married Anne Mercier, a Protestant lady of a distinguished family. After declining overtures from Oxford, Padua and Bologna, in 1631 he accepted the professorship formerly held by Joseph Scaliger at Leiden. Although the appointment in many ways suited him, he found the climate trying. He became involved in a vicious controversy, over the Greek of the &quot;New Testament&quot;, with Daniel Heinsius. The quarrel became both highly personal and widely known, and Heinsius as university librarian refused him access to the books he wished to consult. Salmasius had an ally in Gerardus Vossius, on religious grounds.

Following his polemical &quot;Defensio Regis&quot; of 1649, a flattering invitation from Queen Christina induced him to visit Sweden in 1650. Christina loaded him with gifts and distinctions. Salmasius had enemies there: Nikolaes Heinsius, son of his foe Daniel, but also Isaac Vossius (son of Gerardus) with whom he had fallen out. They circulated gossip about him.
Salmasius withdrew from Sweden in 1651; Christina sent warm letters and pressed him to return.

Salmasius died on 3 September 1653, at Spa.

==Work==

He was a prolific author and textual critic. He first published (1608) an edition of a work by Nilus Cabasilas, (archbishop of Thessalonica in the 14th century) against the primacy of the pope (&quot;De primatu Papae&quot;), and an edition of a similar tract by the Calabrian monk Barlaam of Seminara (ca. 1290-1348). In 1609 he brought out an edition of Florus; a later edition (1638) included also the &quot;editio princeps&quot; of the &quot;Liber Memorialis&quot; of Lucius Ampelius.

In 1606 or 1607 Salmasius had discovered in the library of the Counts Palatine in Heidelberg the only surviving copy of Cephalas&#x27;s 10th-century unexpurgated copy of the &quot;Greek Anthology&quot;, including the 258-poem anthology of homoerotic poems by Straton of Sardis that would eventually become known as the notorious Book 12 of the &quot;Greek Anthology&quot;. Salmasius made copies of the newly discovered poems in the Palatine version and began to circulate clandestine manuscript copies of them as the &quot;Anthologia Inedita&quot;. His copy later appeared in print: first in 1776 when Richard François Philippe Brunck included it in his &quot;Analecta&quot;; and also when Friedrich Jacobs published the full Palatine Anthology as the &quot;Anthologia Graeca&quot; (13 vols. 1794-1803; revised 1813-1817). The remains of Straton&#x27;s anthology became Book 12 in Jacob&#x27;s standard critical &quot;Anthologia Graeca&quot; edition. Only in 2001 did a full Greek-to-English translation of Book 12 appear (from Princeton University Press).

In 1620 Salmasius published Casaubon&#x27;s notes on the &quot;Augustan History&quot;, with copious additions of his own. In 1629 he produced his &quot;magnum opus&quot; as a critic, his commentary on Gaius Julius Solinus&#x27;s &quot;Polyhistor&quot;, or rather on Pliny the Elder, to whom Solinus is indebted for the most important part of his work. Greatly as his contemporaries may have overrated this commentary, it stands as a monument of learning and industry. Salmasius learned Arabic to qualify himself for the botanical part of his task.

Shortly after his removal to the Netherlands, Salmasius composed (at the request of Prince Frederick Henry of Nassau) his treatise on the military system of the Romans (&quot;De re militari Romanorum&quot;), which remained unpublished until 1657. Other works followed, mostly philological, but including a denunciation of wigs and hair-powder.

The &quot;De usuris liber&quot; (1630) and subsequent writing was a vindication of moderate and lawful interest for money. Although it was opposed by lawyers and theologians, the Dutch Reformed Church began to admit money-lenders to the sacrament. His treatise &quot;De primatu Papae&quot; (1645), accompanying a republication of the tract of Nilus Cabasilas, excited controversy in France, but the government declined to suppress it.

In 1643 he published &quot;De Hellenistica Commentarius&quot;, including linguistic theories of Johann Elichmann on the origins of the Greek language. In 1649, in November, appeared the work for which many remember Salmasius best: his royalist tract &quot;Defensio regia pro Carolo I&quot; provoked by the execution of Charles I.

His advice had already been sought on English and Scottish affairs, and, inclining to Presbyterianism or to a modified episcopacy, he had written against the English religious Independents. It remains unknown whose influence induced him to undertake the &quot;Defensio regia&quot;, but Charles II defrayed the expense of printing, and presented the author with £100. The first edition appeared anonymously, but the author was universally known. A French translation (which speedily appeared under the name of &quot;Claude Le Gros&quot;) was the work of Salmasius himself. This celebrated work provoked from John Milton the &quot;Defensio pro Populo Anglicano&quot;, including attacks on Salmasius&#x27;s wife along with much other vituperation. Milton also claimed that Salmasius&#x27;s withdrawal from Sweden in 1651 was due to the attack, but Christina&#x27;s continued warmth in letters to him argue against that cause. His reply to Milton remained unfinished at his death: his son published it in 1660.

He is the author of &quot;Simplicii Verini, sive Claudii Salmasii, de Transsubstantiatione liber, ad justum pacium, contra H. Grotium.&quot;.

==Legacy==
Philibert de La Mare, counsellor of the &quot;parlement&quot; of Dijon, inherited Salmasius&#x27; manuscripts from his son and wrote a very lengthy life of Salmasius. Papillon says that this biography left nothing to desire, but no printed edition has ever appeared. However, Papillon himself used de la Mare&#x27;s work for his account of Salmasius in his &quot;Bibliothèque des auteurs de Bourgogne&quot; — by far the best extant. Papillon included an exhaustive list of Salmasius&#x27; works, both printed and in manuscript.

Antoine Clément prefixed a eulogy to his edition of Salmasius&#x27;s &quot;Letters&quot; (Leiden, 1656), and C. B. Morisot inserted another into his own &quot;Letters&quot; (Dijon, 1656). See also Eugène Haag, &quot;La France protestante&quot;, (ix. 149-x73); and, for the &quot;Defensio regia&quot;, David Masson&#x27;s &quot;Life of Milton&quot;.

<text>Großräschen (Sorbian: &quot;Rań&quot;) is a town in Lower Lusatia, in Germany. Administratively, it is part of the district of Oberspreewald-Lausitz, in the state of Brandenburg.

==Geographical position==

Großräschen is south of the &quot;Niederlausitzer Landrücken&quot;, a sandy stretch of land with pine forests in the centre of Lusatia. The source of the small river Rainitza used to be in meadows north of the town centre. South of the town, Lake Grossraschen (formerly an open-cast lignite mine) was completed in 2018. The town proper comprises the historical core, Kleinräschen, and Großräschen. The southernmost quarter, Bückgen, was pulled down due to mining. Outside the town proper are the villages of Freienhufen (historically Dobristroh), Bulldorf, Dörrwalde, Wormlage, Saalhausen, Woschkow, and Schmogro (Großräschen-Ost).

==History==

Both Großräschen and Kleinräschen were first mentioned in an official document in 1370. The form of settlement and the name suggest that Kleinräschen is older than Großräschen. The villages developed slowly; the Wendish population depended almost entirely on agriculture. From the middle of the 19th century onwards, heavy industry developed, and the villages grew rapidly. From 1815 to 1947, they were part of the Prussian Province of Brandenburg. In 1965, they were granted the status of a town, having been incorporated into one community in 1925. From 1952 to 1990, Großräschen was part of the Bezirk Cottbus of East Germany. The 1980s brought the destruction of Bückgen, whose 4000 inhabitants had to leave their homes and were moved into blocks of flats. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the industrial decline (glass manufacturing, brick production, mining and agriculture used to appear in the town&#x27;s coat of arms) caused heavy unemployment. The completion of the Grossraschen lake instigated a tourism industry with lakeside hotels, town marina harbor, rental holiday homes, and a lakeside winery.

==Mayors==
Thomas Zenker (SPD) was elected in November 2009 with 93.9% of the votes for a term of eight years. (Turnout 35.3%). He was re-elected in September 2017 with 85.6% for a second term of eight years.

<doc id="235958" wikidata="Q7069665" url="?curid=235958" title="Numerical sight-singing">
<text>Numerical sight-singing, an alternative to the solfege system of sight-singing, is a musical notation system that numbers the diatonic scale with the numbers one through eight (or, alternately, one to seven, with the octave again being one).

In this system, 1 is always the root or origin, but the scale being represented may be major, minor, or any of the diatonic mode. Accidentals (sharps and flats outside the key signature) are noted with a + or - when the numbers are written, but are often skipped when they are spoken or sung.

In some pedagogies involving numerical sight-singing notation students are not taught to modify vowels to represent sharp or flat notes. In these cases the students usually name the note and whether it is flat or sharp. For example, an augmented unison (&quot;ouey&quot;) might be called &quot;one sharp,&quot; and in some other pedagogies this same pitch may also simply be called &quot;one.&quot;

==Comparison with other systems==
There is a continual debate about the merits of this system as compared to solfege: it holds the advantage that when dealing with abstract concepts such as interval distance a student may easily recognize that the distance between 1 and 5 is larger than the distance between 1 and 4 because of the numerical values assigned (as compared to Solfege, where comparing Do to Sol and Do to Fa remain completely abstract until sung or played). A drawback often pointed out is that numerical numbers are not always &quot;singable,&quot; for example, scale degree 7 (ti, in solfege) contains vowels that are hard to tune.

Numerical sight singing is not the same as integer notation derived from musical set theory and used primarily for sight singing atonal music. Nor is it the same as &quot;count singing&quot;, a technique popularized by Robert Shaw in which the numbers sung represent the rhythms of a piece in accordance with the beat of a measure.

<doc id="235959" wikidata="Q102341" url="?curid=235959" title="Farrah Fawcett">
<text>Farrah Leni Fawcett (born Ferrah Leni Fawcett; February 2, 1947 – June 25, 2009) was an American actress. A four-time Primetime Emmy Award nominee and six-time Golden Globe Award nominee, Fawcett rose to international fame when she played a starring role in the first season of the television series &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;.

Fawcett began her career in the 1960s appearing in commercials and guest roles on television. During the 1970s, she appeared in numerous television series, including recurring roles on &quot;Harry O&quot; (1974–1976), and &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; (1974–1978) with her then-husband, film and television star Lee Majors. Her iconic red swimsuit poster sold six million copies in its first year in print. With co-stars Kate Jackson and Jaclyn Smith, she starred in the television series &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, playing private investigator Jill Munroe. However, she left at the conclusion of the first season in 1976, returning as a guest star in six episodes during the show&#x27;s third and fourth seasons (1978–1980). She received her first Golden Globe nomination for her work in the show.

In 1983, Fawcett received positive reviews for her performance in the Off-Broadway play &quot;Extremities&quot;. She was subsequently cast in the 1986 film version and received a Golden Globe nomination. She received Emmy Award nominations for her role as a battered wife in &quot;The Burning Bed&quot; (1984) and for her portrayal of real-life murderer Diane Downs in &quot;Small Sacrifices&quot; (1989). Her 1980s work in TV movies earned her four additional Golden Globe nominations. Although Fawcett weathered some negative press for a rambling appearance on &quot;The Late Show with David Letterman&quot; in 1997, she garnered strong reviews that year for her role in the film &quot;The Apostle&quot; with Robert Duvall. In the 21st century, she continued acting on television, holding recurring roles on the sitcom &quot;Spin City&quot; (2001) and the drama &quot;The Guardian&quot; (2002–2003). For the latter, she received her third Emmy nomination. Fawcett&#x27;s film credits include &quot;Love Is a Funny Thing&quot; (1969), &quot;Myra Breckinridge&quot; (1970), &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot; (1976), &quot;Sunburn&quot; (1979), &quot;Saturn 3&quot; (1980), &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot; (1981), &quot;Extremities&quot; (1986), &quot;The Apostle&quot; (1997), and &quot;Dr. T &amp; the Women&quot; (2000), &amp; &quot;The Cookout&quot; (2004).

Fawcett was diagnosed with anal cancer in 2006 and died three years later at age 62. The 2009 NBC documentary &quot;Farrah&#x27;s Story&quot; chronicled her battle with the disease. She posthumously earned her fourth Emmy nomination for her work as a producer on &quot;Farrah&#x27;s Story&quot;.

==Early life==
Farrah Leni Fawcett was born on February 2, 1947, in Corpus Christi, Texas, the younger of two daughters. Her mother, Pauline Alice Fawcett (née Evans; 1914–2005), was a homemaker and her father, James William Fawcett (1917–2010), was an oil field contractor. She was of Irish, French, English and Choctaw Native American ancestry. Fawcett once said the name &quot;Ferrah&quot; was &quot;made up&quot; by her mother, because it went well with their last name.

A Roman Catholic, Fawcett began her early education at the parish school of the church her family attended, St. Patrick&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church in Corpus Christi. She graduated from W. B. Ray High School in Corpus Christi, where she was voted &quot;most beautiful&quot; by her classmates in her freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior years of high school.

Between 1965 and 1968, she attended the University of Texas, where she studied microbiology before switching her major to art, studying under Charles Umlauf, her &quot;favorite professor&quot; with whom she had a close mentoring relationship; in 2017, works by Fawcett were shown at the Umlauf Sculpture Garden and Museum in Austin in the exhibit &quot;Mentoring a Muse&quot;. She lived at the Mayfair House on Pearl Street, west of the campus, and was a member of Delta Delta Delta sorority.

In her freshman year of college, she was named one of the &quot;ten most beautiful coeds on campus&quot;, and it was the first time that a freshman had been chosen for the honor. Her photos were sent to various agencies in Hollywood. David Mirisch, a Hollywood agent, called her and urged her to come to Los Angeles. She turned him down, but he continued for the next two years. Finally, in the summer of 1968, Fawcett moved to Los Angeles, initially staying at the Hollywood Studio Club, with her parents&#x27; permission to &quot;try her luck&quot; in the entertainment industry.

==Career==
===Early career===

When Fawcett arrived in Hollywood at age 21 in 1968, Screen Gems signed her to a $350-a-week contract. She began to appear in commercials for such products as Ultra Brite toothpaste, Noxzema skin cream, Max Factor cosmetics, Mercury Cougar automobiles, and Beautyrest mattresses, among others. Her earliest acting appearances were guest spots on &quot;The Flying Nun&quot; (1969) and &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; (1969–70). She made numerous other television appearances, including &quot;Getting Together&quot;, &quot;Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law&quot;, &quot;Mayberry R.F.D.&quot;, and &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;. She appeared in four episodes of &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; with husband Lee Majors, on &quot;The Dating Game&quot; and &quot;S.W.A.T&quot;, and had a recurring role on &quot;Harry O&quot; alongside David Janssen as the title character&#x27;s girlfriend, Sue. She had a sizable part in the 1969 French romantic-drama &quot;Love Is a Funny Thing&quot;. She played the role of Mary Ann Pringle in &quot;Myra Breckinridge&quot; (1970).

=== Rise to stardom ===
In 1976, Pro Arts Inc. pitched the idea of a poster of Fawcett to her agent. A photo shoot was then arranged with photographer Bruce McBroom, who was hired by the poster company. According to friend Nels Van Patten, Fawcett styled her own hair and did her makeup without the aid of a mirror. Her blonde highlights were further heightened by a squeeze of lemon juice. Fawcett selected her six favorite pictures from 40 rolls of film, and the choice was eventually narrowed to the one that made her famous. The resulting image of Fawcett in a one-piece red bathing suit is the best-selling poster in history.
Fawcett earned a supporting role in Michael Anderson&#x27;s science-fiction film &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot; (1976) with Michael York. She and her husband, television star Lee Majors, were frequent tennis partners with producer Aaron Spelling. Spelling and his business partner eventually chose Fawcett to play Jill Munroe in their upcoming made-for-TV movie, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, a movie of the week which aired on March 21, 1976, on ABC. The movie starred Fawcett (then billed as Farrah Fawcett-Majors), Kate Jackson, and Jaclyn Smith as private investigators for Townsend Associates, a detective agency run by a reclusive multimillionaire whom the women had never met. Voiced by John Forsythe, the Charles Townsend character presented cases and dispensed advice via a speakerphone to his core team of three female employees, whom he referred to as &quot;Angels&quot;. They were aided in the office and occasionally in the field by two male associates, played by character actors David Doyle and David Ogden Stiers. The program quickly earned a huge following, leading the network to air it a second time and approve production for a series, with the pilot&#x27;s principal cast minus Ogden Stiers.

The &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; series proper formally debuted on September 22, 1976. Each of the three actresses was propelled to stardom, but Fawcett dominated popularity polls. She subsequently won a People&#x27;s Choice Award for &quot;Favorite Performer in a New TV Program&quot;. In a 1977 interview with &quot;TV Guide&quot;, she said, &quot;When the show was number three, I thought it was our acting. When we got to be number one, I decided it could only be because none of us wears a bra.&quot; Fawcett&#x27;s appearance in the television show boosted sales of her poster, and she earned far more in royalties from poster sales than from her salary for appearing in &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;. Her hairstyle went on to become an international trend, with women sporting a &quot;Farrah-do&quot;, a &quot;Farrah-flip&quot;, or simply &quot;Farrah hair&quot;. Iterations of her hair style predominated among American women&#x27;s hairstyles well into the 1980s.
In the spring of 1977, Fawcett left &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; after only one season. After a series of legal battles over her contract with ABC, Cheryl Ladd replaced her on the show, portraying Jill Munroe&#x27;s younger sister Kris Munroe. Over the years, numerous explanations were offered for Fawcett&#x27;s precipitous withdrawal from the show. Because her husband, Lee Majors, was the star of an established television show as well (ABC&#x27;s &quot;Six Million Dollar Man&quot;, which aired from 1974 to 1978), the strain on her marriage due to filming schedules that kept them apart for long periods was frequently cited, but her ambition to broaden her acting abilities in films has also been given as an explanation. She never officially signed her series contract with Spelling, owing to protracted negotiations over royalties from her image&#x27;s use in peripheral products, which led to an even more protracted lawsuit filed by Spelling and his company when she left the show. As a result of leaving her contract four years early, she reluctantly signed a new contract with ABC, stating that she would make six guest appearances on the series over a two-year period (1978–1980).

&quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; was a global success, maintaining its appeal in syndication and spawning, particularly in the show&#x27;s first three seasons, a cottage industry of peripheral products, including several series of bubble gum cards, two sets of fashion dolls, numerous posters, puzzles, and school supplies, novelizations of episodes, toy vans, and a board game, all featuring Fawcett&#x27;s likeness. The &quot;Angels&quot; also appeared on the covers of magazines around the world, from countless fan magazines to &quot;TV Guide&quot; (four times) to &quot;Time&quot;.

In 2004, the television film &quot;Behind the Camera: The Unauthorized Story of Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; dramatized the events from the show, with supermodel and actress Tricia Helfer portraying Fawcett and Ben Browder portraying Lee Majors, Fawcett&#x27;s then-husband.

===Post-&quot;Angels&quot; film roles===
In 1978, Fawcett&#x27;s first post-&quot;Angels&quot; movie, &quot;Somebody Killed Her Husband&quot;, was released to adverse reviews (some critics referred to the film as Somebody Killed Her Career) and a poor box-office. The 1979 release of &quot;Sunburn&quot;, co-starring Charles Grodin and Art Carney, was met by equally unfavorable reviews. In 1980, Fawcett starred with Kirk Douglas in Stanley Donen&#x27;s science-fiction film &quot;Saturn 3&quot;; the film earned unfavorable reviews from critics and experienced poor box office sales. The following year she starred alongside an ensemble cast, which included Burt Reynolds, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis Jr. in the comedy &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot; (1981). Later that year, she co-starred with Katharine Ross, Sam Elliott, and Andy Griffith in the television movie &quot;Murder in Texas&quot;.

In 1983, Fawcett won critical acclaim for her role in the Off-Broadway stage production of the controversial play &quot;Extremities&quot;, written by William Mastrosimone. Replacing Susan Sarandon, she played the role of an attempted rape victim who turns the tables on her attacker. She described the role as &quot;the most grueling, the most intense, the most physically demanding and emotionally exhausting&quot; of her career. During one performance, a stalker in the audience disrupted the show by asking Fawcett if she had received the photos and letters he had mailed her. Police removed the man and were able to issue him a summons only for disorderly conduct.

The following year, her role as battered wife Francine Hughes in the fact-based television movie &quot;The Burning Bed&quot; (1984) earned her the first of her four Emmy Award nominations. The project was the first television movie to provide a nationwide 800 number that offered help for others in the situation, in this case victims of domestic abuse. It was the highest-rated television movie of the season.

In 1986, Fawcett appeared in the movie version of &quot;Extremities&quot;, which performed well financially. For her performance she received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama. She appeared in Jon Avnet&#x27;s &quot;Between Two Women&quot; with Colleen Dewhurst, and took several more dramatic roles as either infamous or renowned women. She was nominated for Golden Globe awards for roles as Beate Klarsfeld in &quot;Nazi Hunter: The Beate Klarsfeld Story&quot; and troubled Woolworth heiress Barbara Hutton in &quot;Poor Little Rich Girl: The Barbara Hutton Story&quot;, and won a CableACE Award for her 1989 portrayal of groundbreaking &quot;LIFE&quot; magazine photojournalist Margaret Bourke-White in &quot;Double Exposure: The Story of Margaret Bourke-White&quot;.

Her 1989 portrayal of convicted murderer Diane Downs in the miniseries &quot;Small Sacrifices&quot; earned her a second Emmy nomination and her sixth Golden Globe Award nomination. The miniseries won a Peabody Award for excellence in television, with Fawcett&#x27;s performance singled out by the organization, which stated &quot;Ms. Fawcett brings a sense of realism rarely seen in television miniseries (to) a drama of unusual power&quot;.

===Later career===
Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Fawcett had steadfastly resisted signing a release for nude photographs of her to be published in magazines, even though she had briefly appeared topless in the 1980 film &quot;Saturn 3.&quot; She caused a major stir by posing semi-nude in the December 1995 issue of &quot;Playboy.&quot; At the age of 50, she appeared in a pictorial for the July 1997 issue of &quot;Playboy,&quot; which also became a top seller. The issue and its accompanying video featured Fawcett actually using her own body to paint on canvas; for years, this had been one of her ambitions.

On June 5, 1997, Fawcett received negative commentary after she gave a rambling interview and appeared distracted on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. Months later, she told the host of &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; that her behavior was just her way of joking around with the television host, partly in the guise of promoting her &quot;Playboy&quot; pictorial and video. She explained that what appeared to be random looks across the theater was just her looking and reacting to fans in the audience. Though the Letterman appearance spawned speculation and several jokes at her expense, she returned to the show in 1999. Several years later in February 2009, Letterman ended an incoherent and largely unresponsive interview with Joaquin Phoenix by saying, &quot;We owe an apology to Farrah Fawcett.&quot;

Also in 1997, Robert Duvall chose Fawcett to play the role of his wife in &quot;The Apostle,&quot; which was an independent feature film that he was producing. She received an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Supporting Female for the film. In 2000, she worked with director Robert Altman in the feature film &quot;Dr. T &amp; the Women,&quot; as the wife of Richard Gere. (Her character has a mental breakdown, leading to Fawcett&#x27;s first fully nude appearance.)

Around 2001, Fawcett befriended artist and designer Christopher Ciccone. Ciccone mentioned Fawcett inviting him to view her abstract paintings and sculptures in his book, &quot;Life with My Sister Madonna&quot;. In 2002, Fawcett&#x27;s collaboration with sculptor Keith Edmier was exhibited at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in a show titled &quot;Contemporary Projects 7: Keith Edmier and Farrah Fawcett 2000&quot;. The exhibit was later displayed at The Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The sculpture was also presented in a series of photographs and a book by Rizzoli.

In November 2003, Fawcett prepared for her Broadway debut in a production of &quot;Bobbi Boland,&quot; the tragicomic tale of a former Miss Florida. However, the show never officially opened when it closed during preview performances. Fawcett was described as &quot;vibrating with frustration&quot; at the producer&#x27;s extraordinary decision to cancel the production; just days earlier, the same producer closed an Off-Broadway show she had been backing.

Fawcett continued to work in television and appeared in the made-for-television movies and on popular television series that included &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, four episodes of &quot;Spin City&quot;, and four episodes of &quot;The Guardian.&quot; Her work on the latter show earned her a third Emmy nomination in 2004.

==Personal life==
=== Relationships ===
Fawcett began dating Lee Majors in the late 1960s. She was married to Majors from 1973 to 1982, although the couple separated in 1979. They had no children. Throughout her marriage (and despite the separation) she used the name Farrah Fawcett-Majors in her screen credits.

In 1979, Fawcett became romantically involved with actor Ryan O&#x27;Neal, and they had a son named Redmond James Fawcett O&#x27;Neal, who was born in 1985. In 1994, Fawcett told &quot;TV Guide&quot; that their relationship had some troubles. &quot;Sometimes Ryan breaks my heart, but he&#x27;s also responsible for giving me confidence in myself,&quot; she said. After their split, O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s daughter Tatum O&#x27;Neal alleged that he physically abused Fawcett. &quot;He had a terrible temper and was very violent. He beat her up&quot;, she said. Fawcett and O&#x27;Neal rekindled their relationship in 2001. On June 22, 2009, The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and Reuters reported that Ryan O&#x27;Neal had said that Fawcett had agreed to marry him as soon as she felt strong enough.

From 1997 to 1998, Fawcett was in a relationship with Canadian filmmaker James Orr, who was the writer and producer of &quot;Man of the House&quot;, the Disney feature film in which she co-starred with Chevy Chase and Jonathan Taylor Thomas. The relationship ended when Orr was arrested, charged, and later convicted of beating Fawcett during a 1998 fight.

Fawcett dated Longhorn football star Greg Lott while they were undergrads at the University of Texas. Lott said they rekindled their romance in 1998 and had a &quot;a loving, consensual, one-on-one relationship&quot; until she died in 2009. He claimed Ryan O&#x27;Neal kept him from seeing Fawcett in her final days. &quot;He kept me from seeing the love of my life before she died&quot;, he told ABC News. In Fawcett&#x27;s living trust she left nothing to O&#x27;Neal, but she left $100,000 to Lott. Lott insisted Fawcett&#x27;s relationship with O&#x27;Neal was just for show. &quot;Everything she did with Ryan, including all of those so-called reality shows they made together, was just Hollywood fantasy, something she had to do to keep up her image&quot;, he said.

=== Family ===
Fawcett&#x27;s older sister Diane Fawcett Walls died of lung cancer just before her 63rd birthday on October 16, 2001. The fifth episode of her 2005 &quot;Chasing Farrah&quot; series followed the actress home to Texas to visit her father, James, and mother, Pauline. Pauline Fawcett died on March 4, 2005, at the age of 91.

Fawcett&#x27;s only child, Redmond James Fawcett-O&#x27;Neal, was fathered by Ryan O&#x27;Neal and was born on January 30, 1985. He has struggled with drug addiction for most of his adult life and has been in trouble with the law.

===Cancer===
Fawcett was diagnosed with anal cancer in 2006, and began treatment that included chemotherapy and surgery. On February 2, 2007 (Fawcett&#x27;s 60th birthday), the Associated Press reported that Fawcett was cancer-free. The cancer recurred, and in May 2007 she was diagnosed with stage IV cancer that had metastasized to her liver (which has a 5-year survival rate of less than 20%); a malignant polyp was found where she had been treated for the initial cancer.

Not wanting to undergo a colostomy, Fawcett traveled to Germany for treatments described variously in the press as &quot;aggressive&quot; and &quot;alternative&quot;. There, Ursula Jacob prescribed a treatment including surgery to remove the anal tumor, a course of perfusion and embolization for her liver cancer by Claus Kiehling and Thomas Vogl in Germany, and chemotherapy in the US. Although initially the tumors were regressing, their reappearance a few months later necessitated a new course that included laser ablation therapy and chemoembolization. Aided by friend Alana Stewart, Fawcett documented her battle with the disease.

In early April 2009, Fawcett was hospitalized following her return to the United States. On April 6, the Associated Press reported that the cancer had metastasized to Fawcett&#x27;s liver and explained that the hospitalization was not due to her cancer, but instead due to a painful abdominal hematoma. Fawcett was released from the hospital on April 9.

A month later on May 7, Fawcett was reported as being critically ill, with Ryan O&#x27;Neal quoted as saying she was spending her days at home on an IV and often asleep. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that she was in the last stages of terminal cancer and had seen her son Redmond in April 2009, although he was shackled and under supervision because he was then incarcerated. Her 91-year-old father, James, flew to Los Angeles to visit her.

Cancer specialist Lawrence Piro, who was treating Fawcett in Los Angeles, and Fawcett&#x27;s friend and &quot;Angels&quot; co-star Kate Jackson, appeared together on &quot;The Today Show&quot;. They dispelled tabloid-fueled rumors, including suggestions that Fawcett had been in a coma, had dropped to , and had even given up her fight against the disease or lost the will to live. 
&quot;Farrah&#x27;s Story&quot;, a two-hour documentary filmed by Fawcett and Alana Stewart, aired on NBC on May 15, 2009. At its premiere airing, the documentary was watched by nearly nine million people, and it was re-aired on the broadcast network&#x27;s cable stations MSNBC, Bravo and Oxygen. Controversy surrounded the aired version of the documentary. Her initial producing partner—who had worked with her four years earlier on her reality series, &quot;Chasing Farrah&quot;—alleged that the editing of the program by O&#x27;Neal and Stewart was not in keeping with Fawcett&#x27;s wishes to more thoroughly explore alternative methods of treatment of rare types of cancers such as her own. Fawcett posthumously earned her fourth Emmy nomination as the producer of &quot;Farrah&#x27;s Story&quot;.

==Death==

Fawcett died of anal cancer at 9:28 a.m. PDT on June 25, 2009, at age 62, in Saint John&#x27;s Health Center, Santa Monica, California, with O&#x27;Neal and Alana Stewart by her side.

A private funeral was held in Los Angeles on June 30, 2009. Farrah&#x27;s son Redmond was permitted to leave his California detention center to attend the service, where he gave the first reading. Fawcett was interred at the Westwood Village Memorial Park in Los Angeles, next to Rodney Dangerfield.

===Trust and dispute over Warhol portrait===
Fawcett did not name long-time partner Ryan O&#x27;Neal in her living trust, which she had last amended in 2007. She left most of her estate, $4.5 million, to their son Redmond in a trust overseen by her business manager, Richard Francis. While Redmond is permitted to collect interest on the trust, the principal of the trust is available only for matters relating to Redmond&#x27;s health care. Fawcett also left $500,000 to her nephew, Gregory Walls; $500,000 to her father, James Fawcett; and $100,000 to her college boyfriend, Gregory Lott. 

Fawcett&#x27;s art collection was bequeathed to the University of Texas. When the university received it, one of her Andy Warhol portraits was missing. In 2011, after discovering that O&#x27;Neal had retained the portrait, the University filed a lawsuit. O&#x27;Neal claimed that Fawcett had given the painting to him. Lott alleged that Fawcett never gave up ownership of the portrait and that it was her wish to bequeath all her artwork to her alma mater. In December 2013, a Los Angeles court ruled that the portrait belonged to O&#x27;Neal.

===Media coverage===
News of Fawcett&#x27;s death was largely overshadowed by media coverage of the death of Michael Jackson, which occurred a few hours later on the same day. On the night of her death, ABC aired an hour-long special episode of &quot;20/20&quot; featuring clips from several of Barbara Walters&#x27; past interviews with Fawcett, as well as new interviews with Ryan O&#x27;Neal, Jaclyn Smith, Alana Stewart, and Dr. Lawrence Piro. Walters followed up on the story on Friday&#x27;s episode of &quot;20/20.&quot; CNN&#x27;s &quot;Larry King Live&quot; planned a show exclusively about Fawcett that evening until Jackson&#x27;s death caused the program to shift to cover both stories. Cher, a longtime friend of Fawcett, and Suzanne de Passe, executive producer of Fawcett&#x27;s &quot;Small Sacrifices&quot; mini-series, both paid tribute to Fawcett on the program. Coincidentally, de Passe had worked for Motown Records in the 1960s and &#x27;70s, and she had also played a major part in the development of the Jackson 5, which included Michael Jackson. NBC aired a &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; special &quot;Farrah Fawcett: The Life and Death of an Angel&quot; the following evening, June 26, preceded by a rebroadcast of &quot;Farrah&#x27;s Story&quot; in prime time.

That weekend and the following week, television tributes continued. MSNBC aired back-to-back episodes of its &quot;Headliners and Legends&quot; episodes featuring Fawcett and Jackson. TV Land aired a mini-marathon of &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; and &quot;Chasing Farrah&quot; episodes. E! aired &quot;Michael &amp; Farrah: Lost Icons&quot; and The Biography Channel aired &quot;Bio Remembers: Farrah Fawcett.&quot; The documentary &quot;Farrah&#x27;s Story&quot; re-aired on the Oxygen Network and MSNBC. BET aired the 2004 movie &quot;The Cookout,&quot; in which Fawcett had appeared.

Larry King said of the Fawcett phenomenon:

Kate Jackson said of her former castmate:

===Academy Awards&#x27; omission===
In March 2010, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences upset family and friends of Fawcett when she was excluded from the &quot;In Memoriam&quot; montage at the 82nd Academy Awards ceremony. The inclusion of Michael Jackson in the montage, though he was not primarily known for his film roles, only added to the controversy. Friends and colleagues of Fawcett, including Ryan and Tatum O&#x27;Neal, Jane Fonda and film critic Roger Ebert, publicly expressed their outrage at the oversight. AMPAS executive director Bruce Davis noted that Fawcett had been recognized for her &quot;remarkable television work&quot; at the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards in September 2009. On the exclusion, he said: &quot;There&#x27;s nothing you can say to people, particularly to family members, within a day or two of the show that helps at all. They tend to be surprised and hurt, and we understand that and we&#x27;re sorry for it.&quot;

==Legacy==
The red one-piece bathing suit she wore in her famous 1976 poster was donated to the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Museum of American History (NMAH) on February 2, 2011. Designed by fashion designer Norma Kamali, it was donated to the Smithsonian by her executors and was formally presented to NMAH in Washington, D.C., by her longtime companion Ryan O&#x27;Neal. The iconic image of Farrah in a red swimsuit has been recreated in a limited edition Barbie doll with a gold chain and the girl-next-door locks.

In 2011, &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; named Fawcett in its list of the &quot;100 Hottest Women of All-Time&quot;, ranking her at No. 31.

The song &quot;Midnight Train to Georgia&quot; had initially been inspired by Fawcett and Lee Majors. Songwriter James Dawn &quot;Jim&quot; Weatherly phoned Majors, who was one of his friends, but it was Fawcett who actually answered the call. Weatherly and Fawcett chatted briefly and she told him she was going to visit her mother and was taking &quot;the midnight plane to Houston&quot;. Although Majors and Fawcett were both successful by that time, Weatherly used them as &quot;characters&quot; in his song, about a failed actress who leaves Los Angeles and is followed by her boyfriend who cannot live without her. Eventually the genders were swapped to a failed actor who leaves Los Angeles and is followed by his girlfriend, a train replaced the plane, and Houston was changed to Georgia. The recording by Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips attained the number 1 position on the Billboard chart in 1973.

In 1980, O&#x27;Neal facilitated a meeting between Fawcett and artist Andy Warhol, who created two portraits of Fawcett during their time together. Fawcett later lent the portraits to The Andy Warhol Museum. Following a 2013 court case between O&#x27;Neal and the University of Texas, which had been named by Fawcett as the recipient of all of her artwork, one of the portraits was deemed the property of O&#x27;Neal. The portrait was valued at between $800,000 and $12 million during the court case.

<text>Philippe de Mornay (5 November 1549 – 11 November 1623), seigneur du Plessis Marly, usually known as Du-Plessis-Mornay or Mornay Du Plessis, was a French Protestant writer and member of the anti-monarchist &quot;Monarchomaques&quot;.

== Biography ==
He was born in Buhy, now situated in Val-d&#x27;Oise. His mother had leanings toward Protestantism, but his father tried to counteract her influence by sending him to the of the University of Paris. On his father&#x27;s death in 1559, however, the family formally adopted the reformed faith. Mornay studied law and jurisprudence at the University of Heidelberg in 1565 and the following year Hebrew and German at the University of Padua. During the French Wars of Religion in 1567, he joined the army of Louis I de Bourbon, prince de Condé, but a fall from his horse prevented him from taking an active part in the campaign. His career as Huguenot apologist began in 1571 with the work &quot;Dissertation sur l&#x27;Église visible&quot;, and, as a diplomat in 1572, he undertook a confidential mission for Admiral de Coligny to William the Silent, Prince of Orange.

He escaped the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day Massacre by the aid of a Catholic friend, taking refuge in England. Returning to France towards the end of 1573, he participated during the next two years with various success in the campaigns of the future Henry IV of France, then only King of Navarre. He was taken prisoner by the Duke of Guise on 10 October 1575 was but ransomed for a small sum, which was paid by Charlotte Arbaleste, whom he married shortly afterwards at Sedan.

Philippe de Mornay was gradually recognized as Henry&#x27;s right-hand man, representing him in England from 1577 to 1578 and again in 1580, and in the Low Countries 1581-1582. During his time in England, both he and his wife befriended English Protestants like Francis Walsingham, Mary Sidney, and her brother Philip Sydney. With the death of the Duke of Alençon-Anjou in 1584, by which Henry was brought within sight of the throne of France, the period of Mornay&#x27;s greatest political activity began, and after the death of Henry I, Prince of Condé, in 1588, his influence became so great that he was popularly styled the &quot;Huguenot pope&quot;. He was present at the siege of Dieppe, fought at Ivry, and was at the siege of Rouen in 1591-92 until he sent on a mission to the court of Queen Elizabeth. 

He was bitterly disappointed by Henry IV&#x27;s abjuration of Protestantism in 1593 and gradually withdrew from the court, devoting himself to the Academy of Saumur, which had a distinguished history until its suppression by Louis XIV in 1683.

His last years were saddened by the loss of his only son in 1605 and that of his devoted wife in 1606, but he spent them in perfecting the Huguenot organization. He was chosen a deputy in 1618 to represent the French Protestants at the Synod of Dort. He was prohibited from attending by Louis XIII but contributed materially to its deliberations by written communications. He lost the governorship of Saumur at the time of the Huguenot insurrection in 1621 as Saumur was captured by French royal forces, and died in retirement on his estate of La Forêt-sur-Sèvre, Deux-Sèvres.

==Works==

In 1598 he published a work on which he had long been engaged, entitled &quot;De L&#x27;institution, usage et doctrine du saint sacrement de l&#x27;eucharistie en l&#x27;église ancienne&quot;, containing about 5,000 citations from the scriptures, fathers and schoolmen. Jacques Davy Du Perron, bishop of Évreux (who later became cardinal and archbishop of Sens), accused Mornay of misquoting at least 500, and a public disputation was held at Fontainebleau on 4 May 1600. Decision was awarded to Du Perron on nine points presented, when the disputation was interrupted by the illness of Mornay. The Duke of Sully reported that Mornay &quot;had defended himself so poorly that he made some laugh, made others angry, and inspired pity in still others.&quot; Mornay was also instrumental in the drafting of the Edict of Nantes (1598) which established political rights and some religious freedom for the Huguenots.

His principal works, in addition to those mentioned above, are &quot;Excellent discours de la vie et de la mort&quot; (London, 1577), a bridal present to Charlotte Arbaleste; &quot;Traité de l&#x27;Église où l&#x27;on traite des principales questions qui ont été mues sur ce point en nostre temps&quot; (London, 1578); &quot;Traité de la vérité de la religion chrétienne contre les athées, épicuriens, payens, juifs, mahométans et autres infidèles&quot; (Antwerp, 1581); &quot;Le mystère d&#x27;iniquité, c&#x27;est à dire, l&#x27;histoire de la papauté&quot; (Geneva, 1611). Two volumes of &quot;Mémoires&quot;, from 1572 to 1589, appeared at La Forêt (1624–1625), and a continuation in 2 vols. at Amsterdam (1652); a more complete but very inaccurate edition (&quot;&quot;) in 12 vols. was published at Paris in 1624-1625. He is also one—many consider the most likely—candidate for being author of the Vindiciae contra tyrannos (1579), a pamphlet advocating resistance to the French crown.

<doc id="235965" wikidata="Q206119" url="?curid=235965" title="Marcus Terentius Varro">
<text>Marcus Terentius Varro (116–27 BCE) was a Roman polymath and a prolific author. He is regarded as ancient Rome&#x27;s greatest scholar, and was described by Petrarch as &quot;the third great light of Rome&quot; (after Virgil and Cicero). He is sometimes called Varro Reatinus (&#x27;Varro of Rieti&#x27;) to distinguish him from his younger contemporary Varro Atacinus.

==Biography==
Varro was born in or near Reate (now Rieti in Lazio) into a family thought to be of equestrian rank. He always remained close to his roots in the area, owning a large farm in the Reatine plain (reported as near Lago di Ripasottile,) until his old age. He supported Pompey, reaching the office of praetor, after having served as tribune of the people, &quot;quaestor&quot; and &quot;curule aedile&quot;. It is probable that Varro was discontented with the course on which Pompey entered when the First Triumvirate formed 60 BC, and he may thus have lost his chance of rising to the consulship. He actually ridiculed the coalition in a work entitled the &quot;Three-Headed Monster&quot; ( in the Greek of Appian, &quot;The Civil Wars&quot;, II.ii.9). He was one of the commission of twenty that carried out the great agrarian scheme of Caesar for the resettlement of Capua and Campania (59 BC).
During Caesar&#x27;s civil war of 49 to 45 he commanded one of Pompey&#x27;s armies in the Ilerda campaign of 49 BC. He escaped the penalties of having backed the losing side in the civil war through two pardons granted by Julius Caesar, before and after the 48 BC Battle of Pharsalus. Caesar appointed him to oversee the public library of Rome in 47 BC, but following Caesar&#x27;s death Mark Antony proscribed him, resulting in his losing much of his property, including his library. As the Republic gave way to the Empire , Varro gained the favour of Augustus, under whose protection he found the security and quiet to devote himself to study and writing.

Varro had studied under the Roman philologist Lucius Aelius Stilo (died 74 BC), and later at Athens under the Academic philosopher Antiochus of Ascalon (died 68 BC). Varro proved a highly productive writer and turned out more than 74 Latin works on a variety of topics. Aside from his many lost works (known through fragments), two endeavors stand out for historians: &quot;Nine Books of Disciplines&quot; and his compilation of the &quot;Varronian chronology&quot;. His &quot;Nine Books of Disciplines&quot; became a model for later encyclopedists, especially for Pliny the Elder ( to 79 AD). The most noteworthy portion of the &quot;Nine Books of Disciplines&quot; is its use of the liberal arts as organizing principles. Varro decided to focus on identifying nine of these arts: grammar, rhetoric, logic, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, musical theory, medicine, and architecture. Using Varro&#x27;s list, mediated through Martianus Capella&#x27;s early-5th century allegory, subsequent writers defined the seven classical &quot;liberal arts&quot; of the medieval schools.

In BC, in his old age, Varro wrote on agriculture for his wife Fundania, producing a &quot;voluminous&quot; work (also called )—similar to Cato the Elder&#x27;s work &quot;De agri cultura&quot;—on the management of large slave-run estates.

==Calendars==
The compilation of the &quot;Varronian chronology&quot; was an attempt to determine an exact year-by-year timeline of Roman history up to his time. It is based on the traditional sequence of the consuls of the Roman Republic—supplemented, where necessary, by inserting &quot;dictatorial&quot; and &quot;anarchic&quot; years. It has been demonstrated to be somewhat erroneous but has become the widely accepted standard chronology, in large part because it was inscribed on the arch of Augustus in Rome; though that arch no longer stands, a large portion of the chronology has survived under the name of &quot;Fasti Capitolini.&quot;

==Works==
Varro&#x27;s literary output was prolific; Ritschl estimated it at 74 works in some 620 books, of which only one work survives complete, although we possess many fragments of the others, mostly in Gellius&#x27; &quot;Attic Nights&quot;. He was called &quot;the most learned of the Romans&quot; by Quintilian, and also recognized by Plutarch as &quot;a man deeply read in Roman history&quot;.

Varro was recognized as an important source by many other ancient authors, among them Cicero, Pliny the Elder, Virgil in the &quot;Georgics&quot;, Columella, Aulus Gellius, Macrobius, Augustine, and Vitruvius, who credits him (VII.Intr.14) with a book on architecture.

His only complete work extant, (&quot;Three Books on Agriculture&quot;), has been described as &quot;the well digested system of an experienced and successful farmer who has seen and practised all that he records.&quot;

One noteworthy aspect of the work is his anticipation of microbiology and epidemiology. Varro warned his readers to avoid swamps and marshland, since in such areas

...there are bred certain minute creatures which cannot be seen by the eyes, but which float in the air and enter the body through the mouth and nose and cause serious diseases.

A modern scholar, Bertha Tilly, assesses Varro&#x27;s work as follows:

For the immense mass of work completed, for his patriotic fervour, his high moral sentiments, for versatility in forms of writing and in subjects, for the vast range of material, Varro towers above all his contemporaries and his successors: he was distinguished for learning as no other man had ever been or was to be.

<text>Viljandi (, , , , ) is a town and municipality in southern Estonia with a population of 17,407 in 2019. It is the capital of Viljandi County and is geographically located between two major Estonian cities, Pärnu and Tartu. The town was first mentioned in 1283, upon being granted its town charter by Wilhelm von Endorpe. The town became a member of the Hanseatic League at the beginning of the 14th century, and is one of five Estonian towns and cities in the league.
The once influential Estonian newspaper &quot;Sakala&quot; was founded in Viljandi in 1878.

==Symbols==
The flag of Viljandi is bi-coloured, its upper part is light blue and lower part white. The city&#x27;s shield-shaped coat of arms is light blue, with a white rose in the middle. Viljandi is the white rose city – in midsummer there are 720 white roses flowering in front of the city hall, planted for the town&#x27;s anniversary in 2003. In summer, the White Rose Day is celebrated in Viljandi.

==History==
The first records of civilization in the surroundings of Viljandi date back to the 5th millennium B.C. The first written record of the earthen stronghold of Viljandi was in the year 1154 in the commentaries to al-Idrisi&#x27;s world atlas &quot;Geography&quot;.

In the 12th century, a permanent settlement emerged around the stronghold of Viljandi, which also became the economic centre of the ancient Sakala district.

In 1211 the hillfort of the Estonians in Viljandi was besieged by a joint army of Germans, Latvians, and Livonians. The Livonian Sword Brethren (later the Livonian Order) captured the hillfort in August 1223 from a contingent of the people of Ruthenians, who joined forces with the insurgent Estonians. 
In place of the Sakala wooden stronghold a powerful Order Centre was started in 1224. The following year the Grand Master Volquin led the construction of Viljandi Castle at the site of the former hillfort. Viljandi (Fellin) castle was one of the largest in the Baltic region. It was a major fortification of the Livonian Order and was appointed a commander from 1248. The fortress was continually rebuilt and modernized over the next two-hundred years.

In the 13th century, a medieval town arose on the northern side of the stronghold. The Hamburg-Riga town bylaws, lands and population of it were first recorded in 1283. During the first half of the 14th century, Viljandi joined the influential Hanseatic League – the town had become an important stop for merchants on their way to Russia and back. In 1365, the town council was party when peace between Denmark and Hansa was concluded.

In 1470, Johann Wolthus von Herse, then master of the order, took up residence in the castle. In the Middle Ages, Viljandi was a typical small commercial town, which got its main income from transit trade. The local trade and handicraft played an equally important role. In 1481, Ivan III of Russia laid siege to the castle but could not take it. The decline of Viljandi started during the Livonian War and in 1560, the forces of Knyaz Andrey Kurbsky of Muscovite Russia succeeded in seizing and demolished the town and the stronghold.

During the Polish–Russian War in the first quarter of the 17th century, the town and the stronghold were destroyed. Under Swedish rule in the 17th century the town bylaws of Viljandi were cancelled.

After the Great Northern War, Russians seized the power and Viljandi was without laws until the year 1783, when in the course of the regency reforms of Catherine II Viljandi became a district town. This involved the re-establishment of town bylaws. The economic and political importance of Viljandi started to increase. The population, meanwhile, having decreased to the minimum, started to rise again; handicraft, trading and cultural life were enlivened.

In 2005, Estonian Match, the successor of the 100-year-old Viljandi Match Factory, made a six-metre match, which was registered as the largest match in the world in the Guinness Book of Records.

Nobody knows what happened on the lake, but on the other side, the girl just waved him good-bye and left... However, the Boatman, a grey old man now, is said to row on the lake to this day, longing to see those wonderful blue eyes again.

<text>Aquila Romanus was a Latin grammarian who flourished in the second half of the 3rd century AD.

==Life==
He was the author of an extant treatise &quot;De Figuris Sententiarum et Elocutionis&quot;, written as an installment of a complete rhetorical handbook for the use of a young and eager correspondent. While recommending Demosthenes and Cicero as models, he takes his own examples almost exclusively from Cicero. His treatise is really adapted from that by Alexander, son of Numenius, as is expressly stated by Julius Rufinianus, who brought out a supplementary treatise, augmented by material from other sources. According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, Aquila&#x27;s style is harsh and careless, and the Latin is inferior.

<doc id="235968" wikidata="Q214166" url="?curid=235968" title="Hydrogenation">
<text>Hydrogenation is a chemical reaction between molecular hydrogen (H2) and another compound or element, usually in the presence of a catalyst such as nickel, palladium or platinum. The process is commonly employed to reduce or saturate organic compounds. Hydrogenation typically constitutes the addition of pairs of hydrogen atoms to a molecule, often an alkene. Catalysts are required for the reaction to be usable; non-catalytic hydrogenation takes place only at very high temperatures. Hydrogenation reduces double and triple bonds in hydrocarbons.

== Process ==
Hydrogenation has three components, the unsaturated substrate, the hydrogen (or hydrogen source) and, invariably, a catalyst. The reduction reaction is carried out at different temperatures and pressures depending upon the substrate and the activity of the catalyst.

=== Related or competing reactions ===

The same catalysts and conditions that are used for hydrogenation reactions can also lead to isomerization of the alkenes from cis to trans. This process is of great interest because hydrogenation technology generates most of the trans fat in foods. A reaction where bonds are broken while hydrogen is added is called &quot;hydrogenolysis&quot;, a reaction that may occur to carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom (oxygen, nitrogen or halogen) bonds. Some hydrogenations of polar bonds are accompanied by hydrogenolysis.

=== Hydrogen sources ===
For hydrogenation, the obvious source of hydrogen is gas itself, which is typically available commercially within the storage medium of a pressurized cylinder. The hydrogenation process often uses greater than 1 atmosphere of , usually conveyed from the cylinders and sometimes augmented by &quot;booster pumps&quot;. Gaseous hydrogen is produced industrially from hydrocarbons by the process known as steam reforming. For many applications, hydrogen is transferred from donor molecules such as formic acid, isopropanol, and dihydroanthracene. These hydrogen donors undergo dehydrogenation to, respectively, carbon dioxide, acetone, and anthracene. These processes are called transfer hydrogenations.

=== Substrates ===
An important characteristic of alkene and alkyne hydrogenations, both the homogeneously and heterogeneously catalyzed versions, is that hydrogen addition occurs with &quot;syn addition&quot;, with hydrogen entering from the least hindered side. This reaction can be performed on a variety of different functional groups.
=== Catalysts ===
With rare exceptions, is unreactive toward organic compounds in the absence of metal catalysts. The unsaturated substrate is chemisorbed onto the catalyst, with most sites covered by the substrate. In heterogeneous catalysts, hydrogen forms surface hydrides (M-H) from which hydrogens can be transferred to the chemisorbed substrate. Platinum, palladium, rhodium, and ruthenium form highly active catalysts, which operate at lower temperatures and lower pressures of . Non-precious metal catalysts, especially those based on nickel (such as Raney nickel and Urushibara nickel) have also been developed as economical alternatives, but they are often slower or require higher temperatures. The trade-off is activity (speed of reaction) vs. cost of the catalyst and cost of the apparatus required for use of high pressures. Notice that the Raney-nickel catalysed hydrogenations require high pressures:

Catalysts are usually classified into two broad classes: homogeneous and heterogeneous. Homogeneous catalysts dissolve in the solvent that contains the unsaturated substrate. Heterogeneous catalysts are solids that are suspended in the same solvent with the substrate or are treated with gaseous substrate.

==== Homogeneous catalysts ====
Some well known homogeneous catalysts are indicated below. These are coordination complexes that activate both the unsaturated substrate and the . Most typically, these complexes contain platinum group metals, especially Rh and Ir.


Homogeneous catalysts are also used in asymmetric synthesis by the hydrogenation of prochiral substrates. An early demonstration of this approach was the Rh-catalyzed hydrogenation of enamides as precursors to the drug . To achieve asymmetric reduction, these catalyst are made chiral by use of chiral diphosphine ligands. Rhodium catalyzed hydrogenation has also been used in the herbicide production of S-metolachlor, which uses a Josiphos type ligand (called Xyliphos). In principle asymmetric hydrogenation can be catalyzed by chiral heterogeneous catalysts, but this approach remains more of a curiosity than a useful technology.

==== Heterogeneous catalysts ====
Heterogeneous catalysts for hydrogenation are more common industrially. In industry, precious metal hydrogenation catalysts are deposited from solution as a fine powder on the support, which is a cheap, bulky, porous, usually granular material, such as activated carbon, alumina, calcium carbonate or barium sulfate. For example, platinum on carbon is produced by reduction of chloroplatinic acid &quot;in situ&quot; in carbon. Examples of these catalysts are 5% ruthenium on activated carbon, or 1% platinum on alumina. Base metal catalysts, such as Raney nickel, are typically much cheaper and do not need a support. Also, in the laboratory, unsupported (massive) precious metal catalysts such as platinum black are still used, despite the cost.

As in homogeneous catalysts, the activity is adjusted through changes in the environment around the metal, i.e. the coordination sphere. Different faces of a crystalline heterogeneous catalyst display distinct activities, for example. This can be modified by mixing metals or using different preparation techniques. Similarly, heterogeneous catalysts are affected by their supports.

In many cases, highly empirical modifications involve selective &quot;poisons&quot;. Thus, a carefully chosen catalyst can be used to hydrogenate some functional groups without affecting others, such as the hydrogenation of alkenes without touching aromatic rings, or the selective hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes using Lindlar&#x27;s catalyst. For example, when the catalyst palladium is placed on barium sulfate and then treated with quinoline, the resulting catalyst reduces alkynes only as far as alkenes. The Lindlar catalyst has been applied to the conversion of phenylacetylene to styrene.

=== Transfer hydrogenation ===
&quot;Transfer hydrogenation&quot; uses hydrogen-donor molecules other than molecular . These &quot;sacrificial&quot; hydrogen donors, which can also serve as solvents for the reaction, include hydrazine, formic acid, and alcohols such as isopropanol.

In organic synthesis, transfer hydrogenation is useful for the asymmetric hydrogenation of polar unsaturated substrates, such as ketones, aldehydes and imines, by employing chiral catalysts.

=== Electrolytic hydrogenation ===
Polar substrates such as nitriles can be hydrogenated electrochemically, using protic solvents and reducing equivalents as the source of hydrogen.

== Thermodynamics and mechanism ==
The addition of hydrogen to double or triple bonds in hydrocarbons is a type of redox reaction that can be thermodynamically favorable. For example, the addition of hydrogen to ethene has a Gibbs free energy change of -101 kJ·mol−1, which is highly exothermic. In the hydrogenation of vegetable oils and fatty acids, for example, the heat released, about 25 kcal per mole (105 kJ/mol), is sufficient to raise the temperature of the oil by 1.6–1.7 °C per iodine number drop.

However, the reaction rate for most hydrogenation reactions is negligible in the absence of catalysts. The mechanism of metal-catalyzed hydrogenation of alkenes and alkynes has been extensively studied. First of all isotope labeling using deuterium confirms the regiochemistry of the addition:
:&lt;chem&gt;RCH=CH2 + D2 -&gt; RCHDCH2D&lt;/chem&gt;

=== Heterogeneous catalysis ===
On solids, the accepted mechanism is the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism:
# Binding of the unsaturated bond
# Dissociation of on the catalyst
# Addition of one atom of hydrogen; this step is reversible
# Addition of the second atom; effectively irreversible.

In the third step, the alkyl group can revert to alkene, which can detach from the catalyst. Consequently, contact with a hydrogenation catalyst allows &quot;cis-trans&quot;-isomerization. The &quot;trans&quot;-alkene can reassociate to the surface and undergo hydrogenation. These details are revealed in part using D2 (deuterium), because recovered alkenes often contain deuterium.

For aromatic substrates, the first hydrogenation is slowest. The product of this step is a cyclohexadiene, which hydrogenate rapidly and are rarely detected. Similarly, the cyclohexene is ordinarily reduced to cyclohexane.

=== Homogeneous catalysis ===
In many homogeneous hydrogenation processes, the metal binds to both components to give an intermediate alkene-metal(H)2 complex. The general sequence of reactions is assumed to be as follows or a related sequence of steps:
* binding of the hydrogen to give a dihydride complex via oxidative addition (preceding the oxidative addition of is the formation of a dihydrogen complex):
* binding of alkene:
* transfer of one hydrogen atom from the metal to carbon (migratory insertion):
* transfer of the second hydrogen atom from the metal to the alkyl group with simultaneous dissociation of the alkane (&quot;reductive elimination&quot;)

Alkene isomerization often accompanies hydrogenation. This important side reaction proceeds by beta-hydride elimination of the alkyl hydride intermediate:
:
Often the released olefin is trans.

== Inorganic substrates ==
The hydrogenation of nitrogen to give ammonia is conducted on a vast scale by the Haber–Bosch process, consuming an estimated 1% of the world&#x27;s energy supply.
:&lt;chem title=&quot;Hydrogenation of nitrogen&quot;&gt;
\underset{nitrogen}{N{\equiv}N} + \underset{hydrogen\atop (200 atm)}{3H2} -&gt;[\ce{Fe\ catalyst}][350-550^\circ\ce C] \underset{ammonia}{2NH3}
&lt;/chem&gt;
Oxygen can be partially hydrogenated to give hydrogen peroxide, although this process has not been commercialized. One difficulty is preventing the catalysts from triggering decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide to form water.

== Industrial applications ==
Catalytic hydrogenation has diverse industrial uses. Most frequently, industrial hydrogenation relies on heterogeneous catalysts.

=== Food industry ===

The food industry hydrogenates vegetable oils to convert them into solid or semi-solid fats that can be used in spreads, candies, baked goods, and other products like margarine. Vegetable oils are made from polyunsaturated fatty acids (having more than one carbon-carbon double bond). Hydrogenation eliminates some of these double bonds.

=== Petrochemical industry ===
In petrochemical processes, hydrogenation is used to convert alkenes and aromatics into saturated alkanes (paraffins) and cycloalkanes (naphthenes), which are less toxic and less reactive. Relevant to liquid fuels that are stored sometimes for long periods in air, saturated hydrocarbons exhibit superior storage properties. On the other hand, alkenes tend to form hydroperoxides, which can form gums that interfere with fuel handling equipment. For example, mineral turpentine is usually hydrogenated. Hydrocracking of heavy residues into diesel is another application. In isomerization and catalytic reforming processes, some hydrogen pressure is maintained to hydrogenolyze coke formed on the catalyst and prevent its accumulation.

=== Organic chemistry ===
Hydrogenation is a useful means for converting unsaturated compounds into saturated derivatives. Substrates include not only alkenes and alkynes, but also aldehydes, imines, and nitriles, which are converted into the corresponding saturated compounds, i.e. alcohols and amines. Thus, alkyl aldehydes, which can be synthesized with the oxo process from carbon monoxide and an alkene, can be converted to alcohols. E.g. 1-propanol is produced from propionaldehyde, produced from ethene and carbon monoxide. Xylitol, a polyol, is produced by hydrogenation of the sugar xylose, an aldehyde. Primary amines can be synthesized by hydrogenation of nitriles, while nitriles are readily synthesized from cyanide and a suitable electrophile. For example, isophorone diamine, a precursor to the polyurethane monomer isophorone diisocyanate, is produced from isophorone nitrile by a tandem nitrile hydrogenation/reductive amination by ammonia, wherein hydrogenation converts both the nitrile into an amine and the imine formed from the aldehyde and ammonia into another amine.

=== Hydrogenation of coal ===
== History ==

=== Heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation ===
The earliest hydrogenation was that of the platinum-catalyzed addition of hydrogen to oxygen in the Döbereiner&#x27;s lamp, a device commercialized as early as 1823. The French chemist Paul Sabatier is considered the father of the hydrogenation process. In 1897, building on the earlier work of James Boyce, an American chemist working in the manufacture of soap products, he discovered that traces of nickel catalyzed the addition of hydrogen to molecules of gaseous hydrocarbons in what is now known as the Sabatier process. For this work, Sabatier shared the 1912 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Wilhelm Normann was awarded a patent in Germany in 1902 and in Britain in 1903 for the hydrogenation of liquid oils, which was the beginning of what is now a worldwide industry. The commercially important Haber–Bosch process, first described in 1905, involves hydrogenation of nitrogen. In the Fischer–Tropsch process, reported in 1922 carbon monoxide, which is easily derived from coal, is hydrogenated to liquid fuels.

In 1922, Voorhees and Adams described an apparatus for performing hydrogenation under pressures above one atmosphere. The Parr shaker, the first product to allow hydrogenation using elevated pressures and temperatures, was commercialized in 1926 based on Voorhees and Adams&#x27; research and remains in widespread use. In 1924 Murray Raney developed a finely powdered form of nickel, which is widely used to catalyze hydrogenation reactions such as conversion of nitriles to amines or the production of margarine.

=== Homogeneous catalytic hydrogenation ===
In the 1930s, Calvin discovered that copper(II) complexes oxidized H2. The 1960s witnessed the development of well defined homogeneous catalysts using transition metal complexes, e.g., Wilkinson&#x27;s catalyst (RhCl(PPh3)3). Soon thereafter cationic Rh and Ir were found to catalyze the hydrogenation of alkenes and carbonyls. In the 1970s, asymmetric hydrogenation was demonstrated in the synthesis of , and the 1990s saw the invention of Noyori asymmetric hydrogenation. The development of homogeneous hydrogenation was influenced by work started in the 1930s and 1940s on the oxo process and Ziegler–Natta polymerization.

== Metal-free hydrogenation ==
For most practical purposes, hydrogenation requires a metal catalyst. Hydrogenation can, however, proceed from some hydrogen donors without catalysts. Illustrative hydrogen donors include diimide and aluminium isopropoxide, the latter illustrated by the Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley reduction. Some metal-free catalytic systems have been investigated. One such system for reduction of ketones consists of &quot;tert&quot;-butanol and potassium tert-butoxide and very high temperatures. The reaction depicted below describes the hydrogenation of benzophenone:
A chemical kinetics study found this reaction is first-order in all three reactants suggesting a cyclic 6-membered transition state.

Another system for metal-free hydrogenation is based on the phosphine-borane, compound 1, which has been called a &quot;frustrated Lewis pair&quot;. It reversibly accepts dihydrogen at relatively low temperatures to form the phosphonium borate 2 which can reduce simple hindered imines.

The reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline has been reported to be catalysed by fullerene, its mono-anion, atmospheric hydrogen and UV light.

== Equipment used for hydrogenation ==
Today&#x27;s bench chemist has three main choices of hydrogenation equipment:
* Batch hydrogenation under atmospheric conditions
* Batch hydrogenation at elevated temperature and/or pressure
* Flow hydrogenation

=== Batch hydrogenation under atmospheric conditions ===
The original and still a commonly practised form of hydrogenation in teaching laboratories, this process is usually effected by adding solid catalyst to a round bottom flask of dissolved reactant which has been evacuated using nitrogen or argon gas and sealing the mixture with a penetrable rubber seal. Hydrogen gas is then supplied from a H2-filled balloon. The resulting three phase mixture is agitated to promote mixing. Hydrogen uptake can be monitored, which can be useful for monitoring progress of a hydrogenation. This is achieved by either using a graduated tube containing a coloured liquid, usually aqueous copper sulfate or with gauges for each reaction vessel.

=== Batch hydrogenation at elevated temperature and/or pressure ===
Since many hydrogenation reactions such as hydrogenolysis of protecting groups and the reduction of aromatic systems proceed extremely sluggishly at atmospheric temperature and pressure, pressurised systems are popular. In these cases, catalyst is added to a solution of reactant under an inert atmosphere in a pressure vessel. Hydrogen is added directly from a cylinder or built in laboratory hydrogen source, and the pressurized slurry is mechanically rocked to provide agitation, or a spinning basket is used. Recent advances in electrolysis technology have led to the development of high pressure hydrogen generators, which generate hydrogen up to 1,400 psi (100 bar) from water. Heat may also be used, as the pressure compensates for the associated reduction in gas solubility.

=== Flow hydrogenation ===
Flow hydrogenation has become a popular technique at the bench and increasingly the process scale. This technique involves continuously flowing a dilute stream of dissolved reactant over a fixed bed catalyst in the presence of hydrogen. Using established high-performance liquid chromatography technology, this technique allows the application of pressures from atmospheric to . Elevated temperatures may also be used. At the bench scale, systems use a range of pre-packed catalysts which eliminates the need for weighing and filtering pyrophoric catalysts.

=== Industrial reactors ===
Catalytic hydrogenation is done in a tubular plug-flow reactor packed with a supported catalyst. The pressures and temperatures are typically high, although this depends on the catalyst. Catalyst loading is typically much lower than in laboratory batch hydrogenation, and various promoters are added to the metal, or mixed metals are used, to improve activity, selectivity and catalyst stability. The use of nickel is common despite its low activity, due to its low cost compared to precious metals.

Gas liquid induction reactors (hydrogenator) are also used for carrying out catalytic hydrogenation.

<text>Aristides Quintilianus (Greek: Ἀριστείδης Κοϊντιλιανός) was the Greek author of an ancient musical treatise, &quot;Perì Musikês&quot; (Περὶ Μουσικῆς, i.e. &quot;On Music&quot;; Latin: &quot;De Musica&quot;)
According to Theodore Karp, his three-volume work on music &quot;constitutes one of the principal sources of modern knowledge of ancient Greek music and its relationship to other disciplines&quot;. According to the 17th-century scholar Marcus Meibomius, in whose collection (&quot;Antiq. Musicae Auc. Septem&quot;, 52) this work was printed for the first time in 1652, it contains everything on music that is to be found in antiquity.

The dates of Aristides are uncertain. In his book he refers to Cicero (d. 43 BC), and his work was used by Martianus Capella (fl. 410-420). According to Thomas J. Mathiesen, Aristides flourished in the late 3rd or early 4th century AD. One piece of evidence for Aristides&#x27; date, according to Winnington-Ingram, is that fact in the work he addresses two friends called Eusebius and Florentius; the latter name is unknown before AD 300.

Book 1 of the work deals with the theory of music under the traditional headings of harmonics, rhythm, and metre. It depends heavily on Aristoxenus (4th century BC), but with some &quot;intriguing additions&quot;, apparently from a source from the classical period. Book 2 (said by Winnington-Ingram to be &quot;extremely interesting&quot;) discusses the importance of music in the education of the young and in the moral life of individuals. Book 3 discusses the arithmetic of music and explores from the point of view of Platonic philosophy the analogies between numbers in music and numbers in the physical world.

<text>Tomás Enrique Araya Díaz (; born June 6, 1961) is a Chilean-American musician, best known as the vocalist and bassist of American thrash metal band Slayer. He was ranked 58th by &quot;Hit Parader&quot; on their list of the 100 Greatest Metal Vocalists of All Time. Araya, along with Kerry King, are the only members who stayed in the band since its inception. 

Araya was employed as a respiratory therapist in the early 1980s and used his earnings to finance Slayer&#x27;s debut album &quot;Show No Mercy&quot; (1983). Much of Araya&#x27;s lyrical content is about serial killers, a subject he finds interesting; his first credited lyrical contribution was the vampire-themed track &quot;At Dawn They Sleep&quot; from 1985&#x27;s &quot;Hell Awaits&quot;.

==Early life==
Tomás Enrique Araya Diaz was born in Viña del Mar, Chile, but his family moved to the U.S. when he was five. He grew up in Los Angeles. His older brother, Cisco, played guitar. This inspired Araya to pick up bass at age eight. The two played Beatles and Rolling Stones songs, which he would later cite as an influence on his own music.&lt;ref name=&quot;Exclusive! Interview With Slayer Vocalist/ Bassist Tom Araya &quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s, Araya&#x27;s eldest sister suggested he enroll in a program to become certified as a respiratory therapist. Araya&#x27;s father insisted he either find a job or enroll in the course. Araya enrolled in a two-year technical course, learning about air mixture ratios, drawing blood, and how to intubate.

== Career ==

In 1981, Araya was approached by Kerry King, who asked Araya to join his band, Slayer. Araya accepted, using his earnings as a respiratory therapist to finance the band&#x27;s 1983 debut album &quot;Show No Mercy&quot;. Araya requested time off of work from his employer, the Brotman Medical Center, for Slayer&#x27;s first European tour in 1984 and was denied; We need you to come in today.&#x27; They&#x27;d call me at 5:00 in the morning and wake me, &#x27;Someone&#x27;s not coming in, we need you to come in to work. After a month of sporadic attendance, his employers threatened termination; Araya replied &quot;Well, I guess I&#x27;m fired.&quot; Along with King, Araya is one of the two original members to remain in Slayer for the entire length of the band&#x27;s career, having been in the band since 1981. 

In 2006, Araya underwent gallbladder surgery, which disrupted The Unholy Alliance tour. Originally set to launch on June 6, the tour was postponed to June 13. Araya was also unable to finish the vocals for a song entitled &quot;Final Six&quot;, which was to be included on Slayer&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;Christ Illusion&quot;; later released on the special edition of the album. Araya brought his children on the tour stating &quot;it&#x27;s kind of cool to expose them at such a young age. My first concert, I was, like, 17.&quot;
&quot;We [Slayer] have been fortunate- fortunate enough to have lasted as long as we have because a lot of bands don&#x27;t last that long.&quot;

On January 7, 2010, Slayer announced on its official website that back surgery had been scheduled for Araya and that the planned tour would be canceled through April of that year. The site assured fans, &quot;Slayer camp working hard to reschedule dates for later this year.&quot; Araya is known for his aggressive headbanging and began experiencing back problems while the band was on tour in Australia/New Zealand/Japan in October 2009. He had an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. &quot;The surgeon opened up my throat from the front&quot;, he explained. &quot;Apparently it&#x27;s easier that way. They pushed my oesophagus over to one side and did the repair work. It seems to have done the trick but I can&#x27;t headbang anymore.&quot; As a result of his surgery, Araya has significantly tempered his once aggressive on-stage movement and headbanging; now remaining relatively still during performances.

On March 12, 2010, &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; magazine published an interview with Slayer&#x27;s Dave Lombardo about Araya&#x27;s recovery. Lombardo stated, &quot;He&#x27;s recovering extremely quickly and really well. He is just moving forward and doing all the treatments and post operation stuff that he has to go through. He&#x27;s doing good.&quot;

On May 20, 2010, Slayer confirmed that they would play two songs on TV for &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;

On June 3, 2011, Araya received the keys to the city of his birth, Viña del Mar.

In 2014, Araya made a cameo in the heavy metal horror film &quot;Hairmetal Shotgun Zombie Massacre: The Movie&quot;, directed by Joshua Allan Vargas.

From May 2018 to November 2019, with the last show being in their hometown Los Angeles, Slayer embarked on what they called their final world tour and eventually dissolved. 

Following the conclusion of Slayer&#x27;s farewell tour, Araya remained out of the public eye for several years. 

In February of 2024, just weeks after Kerry King stated that he had not spoken to Araya since the conclusion of Slayer&#x27;s farewell tour, Slayer announced that they would be reuniting for two reunion shows in the fall of that year. Araya stated, &quot;Nothing compares to the 90 minutes when we&#x27;re onstage playing live, sharing that intense energy with our fans.&quot;

===Lyrics===
Araya&#x27;s interest in serial killers serves as inspiration for many of his lyrics, including the songs titled &quot;213&quot; about Jeffrey Dahmer and &quot;Dead Skin Mask&quot; about Ed Gein. &quot;I&#x27;m trying to see where these guys are coming from so maybe I&#x27;ll understand. It&#x27;s always kind of intrigued me...&quot;

Araya wrote the lyrics for the Grammy Award-winning song &quot;Eyes of the Insane&quot; from Slayer&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;Christ Illusion&quot;. The lyrics were inspired by an article in the &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; about the casualties of war and the experiences of soldiers coping with physical and psychological trauma. Araya stated, &quot;At points in their tour of Iraq, they need help and the military tends to ignore that, they kind of brush it under the mat and hopes it goes away. They try to make everything seem hunky dory and fine and dandy, when in actuality there is a lot of stuff going on that people can&#x27;t handle. There&#x27;s a lot of soldiers coming home with mental anguish. And the sad part is, we heard about post-traumatic stress after Vietnam and the first Gulf War and the military seems to want to wipe the slate clean with every new war.&quot;

==Personal life==
Araya has a brother, Juan &quot;Johnny&quot; Araya, who currently plays bass in the melodic death metal band Thine Eyes Bleed. He has also occasionally worked as a roadie for Slayer.

Araya resides in Texas, where he owns a ranch with his wife Sandra Araya and two children, daughter Ariel Asa Araya (b. 1996) and son Tomas Enrique Araya Jr. (b. 1998). He and his wife run a family ranch that includes 60+ head of cattle among other ranch animals. Araya reports that he sings country songs to help keep his &quot;singing chops up&quot;. Araya and his wife enjoy horror films such as &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot; and &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot;. The two allowed their children to watch horror films, but made it clear to them that it is just a movie when they asked &quot;Is this real?&quot; His children were homeschooled.

Araya suffers from sleep apnea and uses a CPAP machine regularly at home and on tour.

In 2010, Araya underwent neck surgery after years of headbanging. The operation went well but he could no longer perform the dramatic motions he used to display, which he described as something he missed doing. While on tour, his brother made a special &quot;weight belt&quot; for Araya to play the bass without straining his neck. After the recovery period ended, he reverted to using standard bass straps.

===Religion===
Araya is a practicing Catholic. In an interview, he expressed his belief that &quot;Christ came and taught us about love, about doing unto others. That was his preach: Accept each other for who we are. Live peacefully, and love one another.&quot; When asked if he believed in God, he replied &quot;I believe in a supreme being, yeah. But He&#x27;s an all-loving God.&quot; Araya explained that he has a &quot;really strong belief system&quot;, and Slayer&#x27;s images and words will &quot;never interfere with what I believe and how I feel... People are not in good shape to where they have to question their own belief system because of a book or a story somebody wrote, or a Slayer song.&quot;

Araya commented about the misconception of the band labeled as Satan worshippers, &quot;Yeah, yeah I think that&#x27;s one of the biggest misconceptions towards the band, but next to that just the fact that we&#x27;re normal.&quot; Referencing Kerry King&#x27;s lyrics, Araya said &quot;I&#x27;m not one that&#x27;s going to go, &#x27;This sucks because it&#x27;s contrary to my beliefs.&#x27; To me it&#x27;s more like &#x27;This is really good stuff. You&#x27;re going to piss people off with this.

In 2016, Araya further explained that the main reason Slayer used satanic imagery was to scare people, in particular, the &quot;Hollywood people&quot;, wanting to separate themselves from the &quot;androgynous Sunset Strip metal scene of the 1980s&quot;.

<doc id="235980" wikidata="Q160830" url="?curid=235980" title="Sarcopterygii">
<text>Sarcopterygii (; ) — sometimes considered synonymous with Crossopterygii () — is a clade (traditionally a class or subclass) of vertebrate animals which includes a group of bony fish commonly referred to as lobe-finned fish. These vertebrates are characterised by prominent muscular limb buds (lobes) within their fins, which are supported by articulated appendicular skeletons. This is in contrast to the other clade of bony fish, the Actinopterygii, which have only skin-covered bony spines supporting the fins.

The tetrapods, a mostly terrestrial superclass of vertebrates, are now recognized as having evolved from sarcopterygian ancestors and are most closely related to lungfishes. Their paired pectoral and pelvic fins evolved into limbs, and their foregut diverticulum eventually evolved into air-breathing lungs. Cladistically, this would make the tetrapods a subgroup within Sarcopterygii and thus sarcopterygians themselves. As a result, the phrase &quot;lobe-finned fish&quot; normally refers to not the entire clade but only aquatic members that are not tetrapods, i.e. a paraphyletic group.

Non-tetrapod sarcopterygians were once the dominant predators of freshwater ecosystems during the Carboniferous and Permian periods, but suffered significant decline after the Great Dying. The only known extant non-tetrapod sarcopterygians are the two species of coelacanths and six species of lungfishes.

==Characteristics==
Early lobe-finned fishes are bony fish with fleshy, lobed, paired fins, which are joined to the body by a single bone. The fins of lobe-finned fishes differ from those of all other fish in that each is borne on a fleshy, lobelike, scaly stalk extending from the body that resembles a limb bud. The scales of sarcopterygians are true scaloids, consisting of lamellar bone surrounded by layers of vascular bone, cosmine (similar to dentin), and external keratin. The physical structure of tetrapodomorphs, fish bearing resemblance to tetrapods, provides valuable insights into the evolutionary shift from aquatic to terrestrial existence. Pectoral and pelvic fins have articulations resembling those of tetrapod limbs. The first tetrapod land vertebrates, basal amphibian organisms, possessed legs derived from these fins. Sarcopterygians also possess two dorsal fins with separate bases, as opposed to the single dorsal fin in ray-finned fish. The braincase of sarcopterygians primitively has a hinge line, but this is lost in tetrapods and lungfish. Early sarcopterygians commonly exhibit a symmetrical tail, while all sarcopterygians possess teeth that are coated with genuine enamel.

Most species of lobe-finned fishes are extinct. The largest known lobe-finned fish was &quot;Rhizodus hibberti&quot; from the Carboniferous period of Scotland which may have exceeded 7 meters in length. Among the two groups of living species, the coelacanths and the lungfishes, the largest species is the West Indian Ocean coelacanth, reaching in length and weighing up . The largest lungfish is the marbled lungfish which can reach 2 m (6.6 ft) in length and weigh up to .

==Classification==

Taxonomists who adhere to the cladistic approach include Tetrapoda within this classification, encompassing all species of vertebrates with four limbs. The fin-limbs found in lobe-finned fishes like the coelacanths display a strong resemblance to the presumed ancestral form of tetrapod limbs. Lobe-finned fishes seemingly underwent two distinct evolutionary paths, leading to their classification into two subclasses: the Rhipidistia (comprising the Dipnoi, or lungfish, and the Tetrapodomorpha, which includes the Tetrapoda) and the Actinistia (represented by coelacanths).
===Taxonomy===
The classification below follows Benton (2004), and uses a synthesis of rank-based Linnaean taxonomy and also reflects evolutionary relationships. Benton included the superclass Tetrapoda in the subclass Sarcopterygii in order to reflect the direct descent of tetrapods from lobe-finned fish, despite the former being assigned a higher taxonomic rank.


==Evolution==

Lobe-finned fishes and their sister group, the ray-finned fishes, make up the superclass Osteichthyes, characterized by the presence of swim bladders (which share ancestry with lungs) as well as the evolution of ossified endoskeleton instead of cartilages like the skeletons of acanthodians, chondrichthyians and most placoderms. There are otherwise vast differences in fin, respiratory and circulatory structures between the Sarcopterygii and the Actinopterygii, such as the presence of cosmoid layers in the scales of sarcopterygians. The earliest sarcopterygian fossils were found in the uppermost Silurian, about 418 Ma. They closely resembled the acanthodians (the &quot;spiny fish&quot;, a taxon that became extinct at the end of the Paleozoic). In the early–middle Devonian (416–385 Ma), while the predatory placoderms dominated the seas, some sarcopterygians came into freshwater habitats.

In the Early Devonian (416–397 Ma), the sarcopterygians, or lobe-finned fishes, split into two main lineages: the coelacanths and the rhipidistians. Coelacanths never left the oceans and their heyday was the late Devonian and Carboniferous, from 385 to 299 Ma, as they were more common during those periods than in any other period in the Phanerozoic. 
Actinistians, a group within the lobe-finned fish, have been around for almost 380 million years. Over time, researchers have identified 121 species spread across 47 genera. Some species are well-documented in their evolutionary placement, while others are harder to track. The greatest boom in actinistian diversity happened during the Early Triassic, just after the Great Dying.
Coelacanths of the genus &quot;Latimeria&quot; still live today in the open oceans and retained many primordial features of ancient sarcopterygians, earning them a reputation as living fossils.

The rhipidistians, whose ancestors probably lived in the oceans near river mouths and estuaries, left the marine world and migrated into freshwater habitats. They then split into two major groups: the lungfish and the tetrapodomorphs, and both of them evolved their swim bladders into air-breathing lungs. Lungfish radiated into their greatest diversity during the Triassic period; today, fewer than a dozen genera remain, having evolved the first proto-lungs and proto-limbs, adapting to living outside a submerged water environment by the middle Devonian (397–385 Ma). The tetrapodomorphs, on the other hand, evolved into the fully-limbed stegocephalians and later the fully terrestrial tetrapods during the Late Devonian, when the Late Devonian Extinction bottlenecked and selected against the more aquatically adapted groups among stem-tetrapods. The surviving tetrapods then underwent adaptive radiation on dry land and become the dominant terrestrial animals during the Carboniferous and the Permian periods.

===Hypotheses for means of pre-adaptation===
There are three major hypotheses as to how lungfish evolved their stubby fins (proto-limbs).

;Shrinking waterhole: The first, traditional explanation is the &quot;shrinking waterhole hypothesis&quot;, or &quot;desert hypothesis&quot;, posited by the American paleontologist Alfred Romer, who believed that limbs and lungs may have evolved from the necessity of having to find new bodies of water as old waterholes dried up.

;Inter-tidal adaptation: Niedźwiedzki, Szrek, Narkiewicz, &quot;et al&quot;. (2010) proposed a second, the &quot;inter-tidal hypothesis&quot;: That sarcopterygians may have first emerged unto land from intertidal zones rather than inland bodies of water, based on the discovery of the 395 million-year-old Zachełmie tracks, the oldest discovered fossil evidence of tetrapods.

;Woodland swamp adaptation: Retallack (2011) proposed a third hypothesis is dubbed the &quot;woodland hypothesis&quot;: Retallack argues that limbs may have developed in shallow bodies of water, in woodlands, as a means of navigating in environments filled with roots and vegetation. He based his conclusions on the evidence that transitional tetrapod fossils are consistently found in habitats that were formerly humid and wooded floodplains.

;Habitual escape onto land: A fourth, minority hypothesis posits that advancing onto land achieved more safety from predators, less competition for prey, and certain environmental advantages not found in water—such as oxygen concentration, and temperature control—implying that organisms developing limbs were also adapting to spending some of their time out of water. However, studies have found that sarcopterygians developed tetrapod-like limbs suitable for walking well before venturing onto land. This suggests they adapted to walking on the ground-bed under water before they advanced onto dry land.

===History through to the end-Permian extinction===
The first tetrapodomorphs, which included the gigantic rhizodonts, had the same general anatomy as the lungfish, who were their closest kin, but they appear not to have left their water habitat until the late Devonian epoch (385–359 Ma), with the appearance of tetrapods (four-legged vertebrates). Tetrapods and megalichthyids are the only tetrapodomorphs which survived after the Devonian, with the latter group disappearing during the Permian.

Non-tetrapod sarcopterygians continued until towards the end of Paleozoic era, suffering heavy losses during the Permian–Triassic extinction event (251 Ma).

===Phylogeny===
The cladogram presented below is based on studies compiled by Janvier &quot;et al&quot;. (1997) for the &quot;Tree of Life Web Project&quot;, Mikko&#x27;s Phylogeny Archive and Swartz (2012).

<doc id="235981" wikidata="Q316098" url="?curid=235981" title="Velleius Paterculus">
<text>Marcus Velleius Paterculus (; ) was a Roman historian, soldier and senator. His Roman history, written in a highly rhetorical style, covered the period from the end of the Trojan War to AD 30, but is most useful for the period from the death of Caesar in 44 BC to the death of Augustus in AD 14.

==Biography==
Few details of Velleius&#x27; life are known with certainty; even his praenomen is uncertain. Priscian, the only ancient author to mention it, calls him &quot;Marcus&quot;, but the title page of the &quot;editio princeps&quot;, printed in 1520, calls him &quot;Publius&quot;, probably due to confusion with a Publius Velleius mentioned in Tacitus. Elsewhere, the same volume calls him &quot;Gaius&quot;. Some modern writers use the latter name, based on an inscription found on a milestone at El Harrouch in Algeria, once part of Roman Numidia; but the inscription identifies this Gaius Velleius Paterculus as &quot;legatus Augusti&quot;, an office that the historian is not known to have held, and it is thought to date from the reigns of Claudius or Nero, by which time he is thought to have been dead. The Gaius Velleius Paterculus referred to may be the same man who was consul in AD 60, and a Lucius Velleius Paterculus was consul in the following year; but it is not apparent how either of them were related to the historian.

Our remaining information comes from Velleius&#x27; own brief description of his life, included in his history. He was born into a noble Campanian family about 19 BC, although the place of his birth is unknown. He was a great-great-great-grandson of Minatus Magius of Aeculanum in Samnium, who received the Roman franchise for his actions during the Social War. Several of his ancestors in subsequent generations held important magistracies or military commands, including his uncle, Capito, who was a member of the Roman Senate.

As a young man, Velleius served as a military tribune in Rome&#x27;s eastern provinces. In AD 2, he was with the army of Gaius Caesar, and personally witnessed the meeting between the young general and Phraates V of Parthia on the banks of the Euphrates. Two years later, Velleius was a cavalry prefect serving in the command of Tiberius in Germania, having already held the office of &quot;praefectus castrorum&quot;. He continued as a senior member of Tiberius&#x27; staff until the future emperor&#x27;s return to Rome in AD 12. While serving under Tiberius, Velleius was also elected quaestor, an important step on the &quot;cursus honorum&quot;, filling that office in AD 7.

Before his death in AD 14, the emperor Augustus designated Velleius and his brother, Magius Celer, for the praetorship. The emperor died before the &quot;comitia&quot; could be held, and so the two brothers were formally elected under Tiberius, serving their year of office in AD 15. Few other particulars of Velleius&#x27; life are known; he dedicated his history to Marcus Vinicius, and from his description of events during the latter&#x27;s consulship in AD 30, Velleius must still have been alive that year. But Velleius was among the friends of Sejanus, whom he praises in his writing, and as there is no evidence that the historian survived his friend&#x27;s downfall by any great length of time, it seems likely that he shared his fate.

==History==
The original title of Velleius&#x27; history is uncertain. The &quot;editio princeps&quot; on title page styles it &quot;P. Vellei Paterculi Historiae Romanae duo volumina ad M. Vinicium cos.&quot; (&quot;Publius Velleius Paterculus&#x27; two volumes of Roman History to the consul Marcus Vinicius&quot;), but this was probably assigned the work by a copyist, or by one of the grammarians. The work is frequently referred to as a &quot;compendium of Roman history,&quot; which has also been used as the title, as have the more abbreviated &quot;Historiae Romanae&quot;, or &quot;Roman History&quot;, or simply &quot;Historiae&quot; or &quot;History&quot;.

The work consists of two books, and was apparently conceived as a universal history. The first covers the period from the aftermath of the Trojan War to the destruction of Carthage at the end of the Third Punic War, in 146 BC. The volume is missing several portions, including the beginning, and a section following the eighth chapter, which deals with the founding of Rome. The second book, which continues the history from the age of the Gracchi to the consulship of Marcus Vinicius, in AD 30, is intact. It is particularly useful as the only connected narrative of events during this period; the portions of Livy&#x27;s history dealing with the late Republic have been lost, and are known only from a brief epitome, while other historians covered only portions of the span. The period from the death of Caesar to that of Augustus is especially detailed.

Velleius&#x27; subject matter consists largely of historical highlights and character portraits, omitting subtler if equally important details. He draws upon the historical writings of Cato the Elder, Quintus Hortensius, Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus, Cornelius Nepos, and Livy, most of which have been lost. He also devotes some attention to Greek and Roman literature, and records unique details about Lucius Afranius and Lucius Pomponius, but he curiously omits any mention of important literary figures such as Plautus, Horace, and Propertius. According to Velleius, the peak of perfection in any literary field is arrived at quickly by the first arrivals. However, this was not an original insight, but a standard view of his time.

==Style==
Velleius&#x27; style is characterized by the showy rhetoric, hyperbole, and exaggerated figures of speech that were typical of Silver Age Latin. Modern appraisals of his approach and its results vary considerably. In the &quot;Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology&quot;, William Smith writes,

In the execution of his work, Velleius has shown great skill and judgment, and has adopted the only plan by which an historical abridgement can be rendered either interesting or instructive. He does not attempt to give a consecutive account of all the events of history; he omits entirely a vast number of facts, and seizes only upon a few of the more prominent occurrences, which he describes at sufficient length to leave them impressed upon the recollection of his hearers. He also exhibits great tact in the manner in which he passes from one subject to another; his reflections are striking and apposite; and his style, which is a close imitation of Sallust&#x27;s, is characterized by clearness, conciseness, and energy, but at the same time exhibits some of the faults of writers of his age in a fondness for strange and out-of-the-way expressions. As a historian Velleius is entitled to no mean rank; in his narrative he displays impartiality and love of truth, and in his estimate of the characters of the leading actors in Roman history he generally exhibits both discrimination and judgment.

A more critical view appears in the 1911 edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;:

The author is a vain and shallow courtier, and destitute of real historical insight, although generally trustworthy in his statements of individual facts. He may be regarded as a courtly annalist rather than a historian. His knowledge is superficial, his blunders, numerous, his chronology inconsistent. He labours at portrait-painting, but his portraits are daubs... The repetitions, redundancies, and slovenliness of expression which disfigure the work may be partly due to the haste with which (as the author frequently reminds us) it was written. Some blemishes of style, particularly the clumsy and involved structure of his sentences, may perhaps be ascribed to insufficient literary training. The inflated rhetoric, the straining after effect by means of hyperbole, antithesis and epigram, mark the degenerate taste of the Silver Age, of which Paterculus is the earliest example.

In his introduction to Velleius Paterculus, Frederick W. Shipley takes a middle ground:

A compendium of Roman history, hastily compiled by an army officer... could hardly be expected to rise to the level either of great history or great literature. And yet, taken for what it is, a rapid sketch of some ten centuries of history, it is, in spite of its many defects... the most successful and most readable of all the abridgements of Roman history which have come down to us. Abridgements are usually little more than skeletons; but Velleius has succeeded, in spite of the brief compass of his work, in clothing the bare bones with real flesh, and in endowing his compendium with more than a mere shadow of vitality, thanks to his own enthusiastic interest in the human side of the great characters of history... [I]t has certain excellences of its own in the treatment of special subjects, especially the chapters on literary history, in which the author has a genuine if not very critical interest, the chapters on the Roman colonies, and those on the history of the organization of the Roman provinces, and in some of the character portraits of the great figures of Roman history.

==Legacy==
Velleius&#x27; treatise was not intended as a careful and comprehensive study of history. The author acknowledged as much, and stated his desire to write a more detailed work, which he indicated would give a fuller account of the Civil War, and the campaigns of his patron, Tiberius, but there is no reason to believe that he ever did so. His history does not seem to have been widely known in antiquity. According to the scholiast, he was read by Lucan; the &quot;Chronica&quot; of Sulpicius Severus seems to have been modeled on Velleius&#x27; history; and he is mentioned by Priscian, but this seems to be the extent of his influence prior to the discovery of a badly damaged manuscript at Murbach Abbey in Alsace in 1515. Although corrupt and since lost, this formed the basis for the &quot;editio princeps&quot; published by Beatus Rhenanus in 1520, and a later copy acquired by Orelli.

<doc id="235985" wikidata="Q568522" url="?curid=235985" title="Der Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten">
<text>&#x27; (German: &#x27;The Steel Helmet, League of Front-Line Soldiers&#x27;), commonly known as &#x27; (&#x27;The Steel Helmet&#x27;), was a revanchist ex-serviceman&#x27;s association formed in Germany after the First World War. While claiming inspiration from Italian fascism, and excluding Jewish veterans, as supporters of a Hohenzollern restoration members distinguished themselves from Hitler&#x27;s National Socialists under whom their clubs were eventually suppressed. After the Second World War, a Stahlhelm network was re-established in West Germany. Following a history of supporting fringe nationalist parties, the last functioning local association dissolved itself in 2000.

==History==
===Weimar Republic (1918–1933)===
&quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot; was formed on 25 December 1918 in Magdeburg, Germany, by the factory owner and First World War–disabled reserve officer Franz Seldte. After the 11 November armistice, the Army had been split up and the newly established German &quot;Reichswehr&quot;, according to the Treaty of Versailles, was to be restricted to no more than 100,000 men. Similar to the numerous &quot;Freikorps&quot;, which upon the Revolution of 1918–1919 were temporarily backed by the Council of the People&#x27;s Deputies under Chancellor Friedrich Ebert, &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot; ex-servicemen&#x27;s organization was meant to form a paramilitary organization.

The league was a rallying point for revanchist and nationalistic forces from the beginning. Within the organization a worldview oriented toward the prior imperial regime and the Hohenzollern monarchy predominated, many of its members promoting the stab-in-the-back legend (&quot;Dolchstosslegende&quot;), the charge that the democratic politicians who had accepted the Kaiser&#x27;s abdication and sued for peace had betrayed an undefeated German army. Its journal, &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot;, was edited by Count Hans-Jürgen von Blumenthal, later hanged for his part in the 20 July plot of 1944. Financing was provided by the &quot;Deutscher Herrenklub&quot;, an association of German industrialists and business magnates with elements of the East Elbian landed gentry (&quot;Junker&quot;). Jewish veterans were denied admission and formed a separate &quot;Reichsbund jüdischer Frontsoldaten&quot;.

After the failed Kapp Putsch of 1920, the organization gained further support from dissolved &quot;Freikorps&quot; units. In 1923 the former DNVP politician Theodor Duesterberg joined &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot; and becoming Seldte&#x27;s deputy and leadership rival. In 1923, Stahlhelm units were actively involved in the formally passive resistance struggle of paramilitary formations against the French occupation of the Ruhr area. These units were responsible for numerous acts of sabotage on French trains and military posts. One of the volunteers operating in the Ruhr area was Paul Osthold, who headed the German Institute for Technical Work Training (DINTA) in the 1930s and became one of the leading representatives of German employers&#x27; associations in the Federal Republic of Germany. From 1924 on, in several subsidiary organizations, veterans with front line experience as well as new recruits would provide a standing armed force in support of the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; beyond the 100,000 men allowed. With 500,000 members in 1930, the league was the largest paramilitary organization of Weimar Republic. In the 1920s &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot; received political support from Fascist Italy&#x27;s &quot;Duce&quot; Benito Mussolini.

Although &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot; was officially a non-party entity and above party politics, after 1929 it took on an anti-republican and anti-democratic character. Its goals were a German dictatorship, the preparation of a revanchist program, and the direction of local anti-parliamentarian action. For political reasons its members distinguished themselves from the Nazi Party (NSDAP) as &quot;German Fascists&quot;. Among their further demands were the establishment of a Greater Germanic People&#x27;s Reich, struggle against Social Democracy, the &quot;mercantilism of the Jews&quot; and the general liberal democratic worldview, and attempted without success to place candidates favorable to the politics of a renewed expansion to the East.

In 1929 &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot; supported the &quot;Peoples&#x27; Initiative&quot; of DNVP leader Alfred Hugenberg and the Nazis to initiate a German referendum against the Young Plan on World War I reparations. In 1931 they proposed another referendum for the dissolution of the Prussian Landtag. After both these referendums failed to reach the 50% necessary to be declared valid, the organization in October 1931 joined another attempt of DNVP, NSDAP and Pan-German League to form the Harzburg Front, a united right-wing campaign against the Weimar Republic and Chancellor Heinrich Brüning. However, the front soon broke up and in the first round of the 1932 German presidential election, Theodor Duesterberg ran as &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot; candidate against incumbent Paul von Hindenburg and Adolf Hitler. Facing a massive Nazi campaign reproaching him with having Jewish ancestry he only secured 6.8% of the votes cast.

===Nazi Germany (1933–1935)===
After the Nazi seizure of power on 30 January 1933, the new authorities urged for a merger into the party&#x27;s &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA) paramilitary organization. Seldte joined the Hitler Cabinet as Reich Minister for Labour, prevailing against Duesterberg. &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot; still tried to keep its distance from the Nazis, and in the run-up to the German federal election of 5 March 1933 formed the united conservative &quot;Black-White-Red Struggle Front&quot; (&quot;Kampffront Schwarz-Weiß-Rot&quot;) with the DNVP and the Agricultural League, reaching 8% of the votes.

On 27 March 1933, the SA attempted to disarm &quot;Stahlhelm&quot; members in Braunschweig, who under the command of Werner Schrader had forged an alliance with scattered republican &quot;Reichsbanner&quot; forces. The violent incident initiated by Nazi Minister Dietrich Klagges and later called &quot;Der Stahlhelm Putsch&quot; was characteristic of the pressure applied by the Nazis on &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot; in this period, mistrusting the organization due to its fundamentally monarchist character. In April Seldte applied for membership in the NSDAP and also joined the SA, from August 1933 in the rank of an &quot;Obergruppenführer&quot;.

On 27 April 1933, Seldte had officially declared &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot; subordinate to Hitler&#x27;s command. The attempts by the Nazis to integrate &quot;Der Stahlhelm&quot; succeeded in 1934 in the course of the &quot;voluntary&quot; &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot; () process: the organization was renamed &quot;Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher frontkämpfer-Bund (Stahlhelm)&quot; () (NSDFBSt) while large parts were merged into the SA as &quot;Wehrstahlhelm&quot;, &quot;Reserve I&quot; and &quot;Reserve II&quot; contingents.

The remaining NSDFBSt local groups were finally dissolved by decree of Adolf Hitler on 7 November 1935. Seldte&#x27;s rival Duesterberg was interned at Dachau concentration camp upon the Night of the Long Knives at the beginning of July 1934, but released soon after.

===Postwar association===

In 1951, &quot;Der Stahlhelm e. V.&quot; was re-founded as a registered association in Cologne, under the patronage of field marshal Albert Kesselring. Active in the right-wing extremist scene, it later became “The Stahlhelm – Association of Front Soldiers - Combat League for Europe&quot; (&quot;Der Stahlhelm e. V. – Bund der Frontsoldaten – Kampfbund für Europa&quot;) with a central training center in Jork, Lower Saxony. Members of Chancellor Konrad Adenauer&#x27;s Christian Democratic Union and of the liberal Free Democrats recognised the association as a legitimate part of an anti-Communist Cold War coalition. However, from the end of the 1950s, as the association began to organize itself in an explicitly paramilitary manner, mainstream politicians withdrew their support. Many meetings were banned because members wore uniforms. 

In the 1960s and 70s, as membership declined, the association identified increasingly with nationalist political parties including the German People&#x27;s Union (Deutsche Volksunion) and the National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD). In the 1980s, many members joined the banned Hoffman Military Sports group (Wehrsportgruppe Hoffmann). Negative press reports about the demonstrations against the Wehrmacht exhibition, weapons finds, and various criminal investigations, accompanied a further disintegration of the organisation. In 2000, the Jork group dissolved itself.

<text>Bichirs and the [[reedfish]] comprise Polypteridae , a family of archaic ray-finned fishes and the only family in the order Polypteriformes .

All the species occur in freshwater habitats in tropical Africa and the Nile River system, mainly swampy, shallow floodplains and estuaries.

Cladistia, polypterids and their fossil relatives, are considered the sister group to all other extant ray-finned fishes (Actinopteri). They likely diverged from Actinopteri at least 330 million years ago. A closely related group, the Scanilepiformes, are known from the later Permian to the Triassic, and are likely ancestral to polypterids. The oldest polypterids are around 100 million years old, from the early Late Cretaceous of South America and Africa.

==Anatomy==
Polypterids are elongated fish with a unique series of dorsal finlets which vary in number from seven to 18, instead of a single dorsal fin. Each of the dorsal finlets has bifid (double-edged) tips, and are the only fins with spines; the rest of the fins are composed of soft rays. The body is covered in thick, bonelike, and rhombic (ganoid) scales. Their jaw structure more closely resembles that of the tetrapods than that of the teleost fishes. Bichirs have a number of other primitive characteristics, including fleshy pectoral fins superficially similar to those of lobe-finned fishes. They also have a pair of slit-like spiracles on the top of their heads that are used to breathe air, two gular plates, and paired ventral lungs. Both lungs are unchambered sacs. The larger right lung reaches the whole length of the body cavity, while the smaller left lung extends to the stomach. A slit-like opening called the glottis located on the ventral side of the oesophagus leads to the right lung, and a separate opening on the right lung leads to the left lung. Four pairs of gill arches are present.

Polypterids have a maximum body length ranging from to over depending on specific species and morphology.

==Diet and traits==
Polypterids are nocturnal and feed on small vertebrates, crustaceans, and insects. Their common aquarium diet includes bloodworms (Chironomidae larvae). Polypterids are known to have extraordinary olfactory ability. Polypterid reproduction consists of the female laying anywhere from 100 to 300 eggs over the span of a few days, and subsequent fertilization by the male.

==Air breathing==
Polypterids possess paired lungs which connect to the esophagus via a glottis. They are facultative air-breathers, accessing surface air to breathe when the water they inhabit is poorly oxygenated. Their lungs are highly vascularized to facilitate gas exchange. Deoxygenated arterial blood is brought to the lungs by paired pulmonary arteries, which branch from the fourth efferent branchial arteries (artery from the fourth gill arch), and oxygenated blood leaves the lungs in pulmonary veins. Unlike most lungfish and tetrapods, their lungs are smooth sacs instead of alveolated tissue. Polypterids are unique in that they breathe using recoil aspiration. Polypterids appear to prefer breathing air via their spiracles when undisturbed or in extremely shallow waters where they are unable to incline their body enough to breathe air through their mouth.

== Polypterids as aquarium specimens ==
Polypterids are popular subjects of public and large hobby aquaria. They are sometimes called dragon bichir or dragon fin in pet shops for a more appealing name due to their dragon-like appearance. Though predatory, they are otherwise peaceful, preferring to lie on the bottom (they tend to swim when there are lots of large plants present). Polypterids make good tankmates with other species large enough to not be prey but small enough to not be predators. Some aquarists note that pleco catfish eat the slime coat off of polypterids. Polypterids in captivity have life expectancies of 10–30+ years. They do well in heavily planted tanks as it mimics their natural habitat.

==Classification==
In addition to the extinct genus &quot;Bawitius&quot;, the two living genera, &quot;Polypterus&quot; and &quot;Erpetoichthys&quot;, have 14 extant species:

<doc id="235989" wikidata="Q502723" url="?curid=235989" title="Rockwell hardness test">
<text>The Rockwell hardness test is a hardness test based on indentation hardness of a material. The Rockwell test measures the depth of penetration of an indenter under a large load (major load) compared to the penetration made by a preload (minor load). There are different scales, denoted by a single letter, that use different loads or indenters. The result is a dimensionless number noted as HRA, HRB, HRC, etc., where the last letter is the respective Rockwell scale. Larger numbers correspond to harder materials.

When testing metals, indentation hardness correlates linearly with tensile strength.

== History ==

The differential depth hardness measurement was conceived in 1908 by Viennese professor Paul Ludwik in his book &quot;Die Kegelprobe&quot; (crudely, &quot;the cone test&quot;). The differential-depth method subtracted out the errors associated with the mechanical imperfections of the system, such as backlash and surface imperfections. The Brinell hardness test, invented in Sweden, was developed earlier – in 1900 – but it was slow, not useful on fully hardened steel, and left too large an impression to be considered nondestructive.

Hugh M. Rockwell (1890–1957) and Stanley P. Rockwell (1886–1940) from Connecticut in the United States co-invented the &quot;Rockwell hardness tester,&quot; a differential-depth machine. They applied for a patent on July 15, 1914. The requirement for this tester was to quickly determine the effects of heat treatment on steel bearing races. The application was subsequently approved on February 11, 1919, and holds . At the time of invention, both Hugh and Stanley Rockwell worked for the New Departure Manufacturing Co. of Bristol, CT. New Departure was a major ball bearing manufacturer which in 1916 became part of United Motors and, shortly thereafter, General Motors Corp.

After leaving the Connecticut company, Stanley Rockwell, then in Syracuse, NY, applied for an improvement to the original invention on September 11, 1919, which was approved on November 18, 1924. The new tester holds . Rockwell moved to West Hartford, CT, and made an additional improvement in 1921. Stanley collaborated with instrument manufacturer Charles H. Wilson of the Wilson-Mauelen Company in 1920 to commercialize his invention and develop standardized testing machines. Stanley started a heat-treating firm circa 1923, the Stanley P. Rockwell Company, which operated until 2012. The building, which still stands, was empty in 2016. The later-named Wilson Mechanical Instrument Company has changed ownership over the years, and was acquired by Instron Corp. in 1993.
== Models and operation ==

The Rockwell hardness test can be conducted on different types of hardness testers. Benchtop hardness testers can be found either in a digital or analog model. Digital models utilize a digital display whereas the analog models display results on a dial on the machine. Other testers are portable.

The determination of the Rockwell hardness of a material involves the application of a minor load followed by a major load. The minor load establishes the zero position. The major load is applied, then removed while still maintaining the minor load. The depth of penetration from the zero datum is measured, on which a harder material gives a lower measure. That is, the penetration depth and hardness are inversely proportional. The Rockwell test does not use any optical equipment to measure the hardness indention, rather all calculations are done within the machine to measure the indention in the specimen. 

The equation for Rockwell hardness is formula_1, where &quot;d&quot; is the depth in mm (from the zero load point), and &quot;N&quot; and &quot;h&quot; are scale factors that depend on the scale of the test being used (see following section).

It is typically used in engineering and metallurgy. Its commercial popularity arises from its speed, reliability, robustness, resolution and small area of indentation.

Legacy Rockwell hardness testers operation steps:

# Load an initial force: Rockwell hardness test initial test force is ; superficial Rockwell hardness test initial test force is . 
# Load main load: reference below form / table &#x27;Scales and values&#x27;. 
# Leave the main load for a &quot;dwell time&quot; sufficient for indentation to come to a halt.
# Release load; the Rockwell value will typically display on a dial or screen automatically.

In order to get a reliable reading the thickness of the test-piece should be at least 10 times the depth of the indentation. Also, readings should be taken from a flat perpendicular surface, because convex surfaces give lower readings. A correction factor can be used if the hardness of a convex surface is to be measured.

== Scales and values ==

There are several alternative scales, the most commonly used being the &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; scales. Both express hardness as an arbitrary dimensionless number.

* Except for testing thin materials in accordance with A623, the steel indenter balls have been replaced by tungsten carbide balls of the varying diameters. When a ball indenter is used, the letter &quot;W&quot; is used to indicate a tungsten carbide ball was used, and the letter &quot;S&quot; indicates the use of a steel ball. E.g.: 70 HRBW indicates the reading was 70 in the Rockwell B scale using a tungsten carbide indenter.

The &quot;superficial&quot; Rockwell scales use lower loads and shallower impressions on brittle and very thin materials. The 45N scale employs a 45-kgf load on a diamond cone-shaped Brale indenter, and can be used on dense ceramics. The 15T scale employs a 15-kgf load on a hardened steel ball, and can be used on sheet metal.

The B and C scales overlap, such that readings below HRC 20 and those above HRB 100, generally considered unreliable, need not be taken or specified.

Typical values include:

* Very hard steel (e.g. chisels, quality knife blades): HRC 55–66 (Hardened High Speed Carbon and Tool Steels such as M2, W2, O1, CPM-M4, and D2, as well as many of the newer powder metallurgy Stainless Steels such as CPM-S30V, CPM-154, ZDP-189. There are alloys that hold a HRC upwards 68-70, such as the Hitachi developed HAP72. These are extremely hard, but also somewhat brittle.)
* Axes: about HRC 45–55
* Brass: HRB 55 (Low brass, UNS C24000, H01 Temper) to HRB 93 (Cartridge Brass, UNS C26000 (260 Brass), H10 Temper)

Several other scales, including the extensive A-scale, are used for specialized applications. There are special scales for measuring case-hardened specimens.

<text>The First Lord of the Treasury is the head of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury exercising the ancient office of Lord High Treasurer in the United Kingdom. Constitutional convention holds that the office of First Lord is held by the Prime Minister. The office is not the United Kingdom&#x27;s finance minister; this role is instead held by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who is the second lord of the Treasury.

==Lords of the Treasury==
As of the beginning of the 17th century, the running of the Treasury was frequently entrusted to a commission, rather than to a single individual. Since 1714, it has permanently been in commission. The commissioners have always since that date been referred to as Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, and adopted ordinal numbers to describe their seniority. Eventually in the middle of the same century, the first lord of the Treasury came to be seen as the natural head of the overall ministry running the country, and, as of the time of Robert Walpole (Whig), began to be known, unofficially, as the prime minister.

The term prime minister was initially, but decreasingly, used as a term of derogation; it was first used officially in a royal warrant only in 1905. William Pitt the Younger said the prime minister &quot;ought to be the person at the head of the finances&quot;—though Pitt also served as chancellor of the exchequer for the entirety of his time as prime minister, so his linkage of the finance portfolio to the premiership was wider than merely proposing the occupation of the first lordship by the prime minister.

Prior to 1841 the first lord of the Treasury also held the office of chancellor of the exchequer unless he was a peer and thus barred from that office; in this case, the second lord of the Treasury usually served as chancellor. Since 1841, the chancellor has always been second lord of the Treasury when he was not also prime minister. By convention, the other Lords Commissioners of the Treasury are also Government Whips in the House of Commons.

==Official residence==

10 Downing Street is the official residence of the first lord of the Treasury, not the office of prime minister. Chequers, a country house in Buckinghamshire, is the official country residence of the prime minister, used as a weekend and holiday home, although the residence has also been used by other senior members of government.

==List of first lords (1714–1922)==

Much of this list overlaps with the list of prime ministers of the United Kingdom, but there are some notable differences, principally concerning Lord Salisbury, who was prime minister but not first lord in 1885–86, 1887–92 and 1895–1902. Those first lords who were simultaneously prime minister are indicated in bold; those who were considered prime minister only during part of their term are indicated in bold italic.
Thereafter the posts of first lord and prime minister have continually been held by the same person .

<doc id="235994" wikidata="Q903124" url="?curid=235994" title="Éleuthère Irénée du Pont">
<text>Éleuthère Irénée du Pont de Nemours ( , ; 24 June 1771 – 31 October 1834) was a French-American chemist and industrialist who founded the gunpowder manufacturer E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company. His descendants, the du Pont family, have been one of the richest and most prominent American families since the 19th century, with generations of influential businessmen, politicians and philanthropists. In 1807, du Pont was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in his adopted hometown of Philadelphia.

==Early life and education==
Du Pont was born 24 June 1771, in Paris, the son of Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours and Nicole-Charlotte Marie-Louise le Dée de Rencourt. His father was a political economist who had been elevated to the nobility in 1784 by letters patent granted by King Louis XVI, allowing him to carry the honorable &quot;de Nemours&quot; suffix. Growing up on his father&#x27;s estate, &quot;Bois des Fossés&quot;, near Égreville, young du Pont was enthusiastic about his studies in most subjects, and showed particular interest in explosives. 

Du Pont was a Huguenot.

In the fall of 1785, du Pont entered Collège de France in Paris. Two years later, he was accepted by the friend of his father and noted chemist Antoine Lavoisier as a student in the &quot;Régie des poudres&quot;, the government agency responsible for the manufacture of gunpowder. It was from Lavoisier that he gained his expertise in nitrate extraction and manufacture. He studied &quot;advanced explosives production techniques&quot;.

After a brief apprenticeship, he took a position at the government-owned powder works in Essonne but quit after Lavoisier left.

Du Pont eventually sailed before his family and landed at Newport, Rhode Island on 1 January 1800, along with his father and his brother&#x27;s family. By 1802, he had established both his business and his family home, Eleutherian Mills, on the Brandywine Creek in Delaware. Du Pont&#x27;s 1 January 1800 arrival in the United States is still celebrated annually by his descendants.

==Career==

In 1791, du Pont began to help his father manage their small publishing house in Paris, where they published a republican newspaper in support of governmental reforms in France. Du Pont was a member of the pro-Revolution national guard and supported the Jacobins. However, on 20 August 1792, both du Pont and his father participated in protecting the escape of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette when the Tuileries Palace was stormed. His father angered fellow revolutionaries by refusing to go along with the guillotine execution of Louis XVI, and the two men&#x27;s moderate political views proved to be a liability in revolutionary France.

His father was arrested in 1794, only avoiding execution because of the end of the Reign of Terror. In September 1797, du Pont and his father spent a night in La Force prison while their home and presses were ransacked. These events led his father to lose hope in the political situation in France, and so he began making plans to move their family to America and aspired to create a model community of French &quot;émigrés.&quot; On 2 October 1799, the du Pont family sold their publishing house and set sail for the United States. They reached Rhode Island on 1 January 1800 and began to settle in the home the eldest du Pont had secured in Bergen Point, New Jersey.

They soon set up an office in New York City to decide what their new line of business would be, but Éleuthère Irénée was not included in much of these plans. However, he saw the possibilities that his earlier apprenticeship with Lavoisier would allow him and his family in America.

===E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company===

Du Pont had no thought of becoming involved with gunpowder manufacture again upon his arrival in the United States, but he brought with him an expertise in chemistry and gunpowder making, during a time when the quality of American-made gunpowder was very poor. Delaware legend holds that he decided to go into the gunpowder business during a fateful hunting trip with Major Louis de Tousard, a former French artillery officer then employed by the United States Army to procure gunpowder supplies. Du Pont&#x27;s gun misfired as he attempted to shoot a bird, which caused him to reflect on his powder-making apprenticeship with Lavoisier as a youth in France. Du Pont commented on the inferior quality of the American-made powder they were using for hunting despite its high price.

At du Pont&#x27;s request, Tousard arranged a tour of an American powder plant. He quickly deduced that the saltpeter being used was of good enough quality; however, the American refining process was poor and inefficient compared with the techniques he had learned in France. He began to think that he could use his experience from France to manufacture gunpowder of a higher quality in the United States and reform the current industry standard for refinery. With his father&#x27;s blessing, he began to assemble capital for the construction of the first powder mills, and returned to France in the beginning of 1801 to procure the necessary financing and equipment.

The act of association was signed on 21 April 1801, and the company was christened E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company since it was its namesake&#x27;s ingenuity that had created this venture. His gunpowder company was capitalized at $36,000 with 18 shares at $2,000 each. He purchased a site on Brandywine Creek for $6,740. There were several small buildings and a dam with foundations for a cotton-spinning mill which had been destroyed by fire. The first gunpowder was produced in April 1804.

==Personal life ==
Du Pont married Sophie Dalmas (1775–1828) in 1791, and they had eight children.

==Death==
Du Pont died on 31 October 1834 in Philadelphia, aged 63. The cause of death was not definitively specified due to &quot;conflicting reports of either cholera or a heart attack&quot; as its cause. He was buried in the Du Pont de Nemours Cemetery on the family property in Wilmington, Delaware.

==Legacy==
The company du Pont founded would become one of the largest and most successful American corporations. By the mid-19th century it was the largest supplier of gunpowder to the U.S. military, and supplied as much as 40 percent of the powder used by the Union Army during the American Civil War. 

Du Pont&#x27;s sons, Alfred V. du Pont (1798–1856) and Henry du Pont (1812–1889), managed the plant after his death, following three years of tutelage by his son-in-law, Jacques Antoine Bidermann. His grandson, Lammot du Pont I (1831–1884), was the first president of the United States Gunpowder Trade Association, popularly known as the Powder Trust.

<text>Isabel Luberza Oppenheimer (23 July 1901 – 4 January 1974), better known as &quot;Isabel la Negra&quot;, was a Puerto Rican brothel owner and madam in barrio Maragüez, Ponce, Puerto Rico. Her name and her brothel, Elizabeth&#x27;s Dancing Club, became part of Puerto Rican folklore both during her life and posthumously.

==Early years and youth==
Isabel Luberza Oppenheimer was born in the San Anton neighborhood of Ponce, Puerto Rico, on 23 July 1901 to Joselino Luberza and María Oppenheimer. Apart from her business as a madam, well documented in many Puerto Rican newspapers such as &quot;El Dia&quot; and &quot;El Vocero&quot;, not much is known about her early life. One widely circulated version is that Isabel left home as a young teenager to live with a wealthy man only to find out that he was married. Another version says she dated and married a much older man, a wealthy American. A well researched and documented story of her life is presented by the prominent criminal attorney and businessman José Ángel “Chiro” Cangiano. In his legal documentary &quot;Receso del Tribunal: Vivencias Judiciales of Jose Angel Cangiano&quot; (&quot;Courtroom Recess: Judicial Experiences of Jose Angel Cangiano&quot;), he debunks those stories and documents Isabel&#x27;s true story: As a young girl of the poor lower class in Ponce, Isabel fell in love with the son of a wealthy upper class homeowner in the city where her mother worked as a housemaid. The elegant gentleman, a young attorney, returned her love in various ways, including purchasing her a home where he would later enjoy her cooking and would occasionally also invite his professional friends, including attorneys, judges, and prosecutors, for socializing with their wives. Their romance, however, ended abruptly when Isabel, walking downtown with her cousin Norma, recognized her wealthy boyfriend as the groom in the nuptial caravan that passed her during her boyfriend&#x27;s unannounced marriage to another girl, also a member of Ponce&#x27;s upper class. Emotionally affected by the experience and &quot;in a bath of tears&quot;, Isabel told her cousin Norma that &quot;the man that from that day hence wants to enter my house has to pay a charge.&quot; Thus developed the beginnings of Isabel as a brothel owner.

==Business and career==
From the late 1930s to the mid-1960s, she owned and operated her bordello in the municipality of Ponce. At that time prostitution was tolerated in Puerto Rico. Her bordello was allegedly visited by politicians, businessmen, and clerics, although this remains unconfirmed.

Dubbed by the public &quot;Isabel la Negra&quot;, she declared herself &quot;Madame&quot; of her brothel. Isabel had two brothels: one in Barrio San Anton and another one in Barrio Maraguez. Some sources claim that, while her brothel businesses made her quite wealthy, the Catholic Church did not accept her donations because of her past and the nature of her profession; but others state the she made many numerous well-received and significant contributions to the Catholic Church in Ponce. Also, for many years, she gave free toys and food to underprivileged children in Ponce on 6 January, Epiphany day (Three Kings Day, in Puerto Rico)
==Death==
Isabel la Negra was shot dead on 4 January 1974, an innocent bystander of a drug-related homicide which occurred near one of her establishments. She was 72 years old. She was buried at Cementerio Civil de Ponce. The Catholic Church, which she had allegedly supported for many years, refused to accept her body into the Ponce Cathedral as part of the ceremonies for her burial. In spite of, and some say as a consequence of, this over 13,000 people attended her funeral.

==Literary and media representations==
Several of Puerto Rico&#x27;s most important authors and filmmakers have been inspired by Isabel Luberza Oppenheimer&#x27;s life and made works based on her experiences. In 1975, Rosario Ferré and Manuel Ramos Otero published two stories about Isabel la Negra in the literary journal &quot;Zona de carga y descarga&quot;. These stories were later reprinted in short-story collections by each author.

In 1979, a film about her life was released, starring Míriam Colón as Isabel, with José Ferrer, Raul Julia, Miguel Ángel Suárez and Henry Darrow. The film was titled &quot;A Life of Sin&quot;, and was directed by Efraín López Neris.

In 2006, Mayra Santos-Febres published a novel based on the life of Isabel la Negra titled &quot;Nuestra Señora de la Noche&quot;. The novel was published by Espasa-Calpe in Madrid, Spain ().

==Legacy==
There is a street in Ponce, crossed by Papo Franceschi street, and named to the memory of Isabel La Negra at Barrio San Antón, the community where Isabel la Negra was born and raised.

<text>In mathematics, a unitary transformation is a linear isomorphism that preserves the inner product: the inner product of two vectors before the transformation is equal to their inner product after the transformation.

==Formal definition==
More precisely, a unitary transformation is an isometric isomorphism between two inner product spaces (such as Hilbert spaces). In other words, a &quot;unitary transformation&quot; is a bijective function
:formula_1
between two inner product spaces, formula_2 and formula_3 such that 
:formula_4
It is a linear isometry, as one can see by setting formula_5

==Unitary operator==
In the case when formula_2 and formula_7 are the same space, a unitary transformation is an automorphism of that Hilbert space, and then it is also called a unitary operator.

==Antiunitary transformation==
A closely related notion is that of antiunitary transformation, which is a bijective function

:formula_8

between two complex Hilbert spaces such that 

:formula_9 

for all formula_10 and formula_11 in formula_2, where the horizontal bar represents the complex conjugate.

<doc id="236010" wikidata="Q134932" url="?curid=236010" title="Tipi">
<text>A tipi or tepee ( ) is a conical lodge tent that is distinguished from other conical tents by the smoke flaps at the top of the structure, and historically made of animal hides or pelts or, in more recent generations, of canvas stretched on a framework of wooden poles. The loanword came into English usage from the Dakota and Lakota languages.

Historically, the tipi has been used by certain Indigenous peoples of the Plains in the Great Plains and Canadian Prairies of North America, notably the seven tribes of the Sioux, as well as among the Iowa people, the Otoe and Pawnee, and among the Blackfeet, Crow, Assiniboines, Arapaho, and Plains Cree. They are also used west of the Rocky Mountains by Indigenous peoples of the Plateau such as the Yakama and the Cayuse. They are still in use in many of these communities, though now primarily for ceremonial purposes rather than daily living. Modern tipis usually have a canvas covering. 

Non-Native people have often stereotypically and incorrectly assumed that all Native Americans in the United States and Indigenous peoples in Canada have at one point lived in tipis, which is inaccurate, as many Native American cultures and civilizations and First Nations from other regions have used other types of dwellings (pueblos, wigwams, hogans, chickees, and longhouses).

== Terminology and etymology ==

&quot;Tipi&quot; is a loanword from the Dakota and Lakota language. Stephen Return Riggs&#x27; 1852 Dakota-English dictionary, which was sponsored by the Minnesota Historical Society spells it as &quot;tipi&quot;. Eugene Buechel spells it as &quot;tipi&quot; in his Lakota-English dictionary. Dakota ethnographer Ella Deloria used the spelling &quot;tipi&quot; throughout her writings, including in her essential book &quot;The Dakota Way of Life&quot;. Lakota linguist Albert White Hat developed his own Lakota orthography and used &quot;tipi&quot; as the spelling. The tipi image is used on almost all Dakota/Lakota tribal flags or seals, and &quot;tipi&quot; is the spelling used by Dakota and Lakota tribes today.

The spelling &quot;tipi&quot; is the one most common in Canadian English whereas the spelling &quot;tepee&quot; is the most common one according to American English dictionaries and the Encyclopedia Britannica and the Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia.

The wigwam or &quot;wickiup&quot;, a dome-shaped shelter typically made of bark layered on a pole structure, was also used by various tribes, especially for hunting camps. The term &quot;wigwam&quot; has often been incorrectly used to refer to a conical skin tipi.

The conventional translation in French and English for all Indigenous dwellings at one time was &quot;lodge,&quot; resulting in many compounds and place names such as sweatlodge, lodgepole pine, Red Lodge, and so on.

== Types and utility ==
=== Structure ===
A tipi is distinguished from other conical tents by the smoke flaps at the top of the structure. The tipi is durable, provides warmth and comfort in winter, is cool in the heat of summer, and is dry during heavy rains. Tipis can be disassembled and packed away quickly when people need to relocate and can be reconstructed quickly upon settling in a new area. Historically, this portability was important to Plains Indians with their at-times nomadic lifestyle. Tribes would have well-organized camp circles of family units living in multiple tipis arranged in order depending on rank or roles in the family unit, community, or ceremony. Generally, the door and camp openings face east in the direction of the sunrise.

A typical family tipi is a conical, portable structure with two adjustable smoke flaps, multiple poles (historically from long) called lodge poles.

Lewis H. Morgan noted that tipi frames were 13 to 15 poles that were tall. These poles, &quot;after being tied together at the small ends, are raised upright with a twist so as to cross the poles above the fastening.&quot; The builders pull the lower ends out to form a circle about in diameter on the ground. They stretch a covering of tanned and untanned buffalo hides, sewn together, over the frame, which they then secure with stakes at the base. &quot;At the top there is an extra skin adjusted as a collar, so as to be open on the windward side to facilitate the exit of the smoke. A low opening is left for a doorway, which is covered with an extra skin used as a drop. The fire-pit and arrangements for beds are the same as in the Ojibwa lodge, grass being used in the place of spruce or hemlock twigs.&quot;

Lodgepole pine is the preferred wood in the Northern and Central Plains and red cedar in the Southern Plains. Tipis have a detachable cover over the structure. The cover has historically been made of buffalo hide, an optional skin or cloth lining, and a canvas or bison calf skin door. Modern lodges are more often made of canvas.

Ropes (historically rawhide thongs or babiche) and wooden pegs are required to bind the poles, close the cover, attach the lining and door, and anchor the resulting structure to the ground. Tipis are distinguished from other tents by two crucial elements: the opening at the top and the smoke flaps, which allow the dwellers to heat themselves and cook with an open fire; and the lining that is primarily used in the winter, which insulates. Tipis were designed to be easily set up or taken down to allow camps to be moved to follow game migrations, especially the bison. When dismantled the tipi poles were used to construct a dog- or later horse-pulled travois on which additional poles and tipi cover were placed.

Tipi covers are made by sewing together strips of canvas or tanned hide and cutting out a semicircular shape from the resulting surface. Trimming this shape yields a door and the smoke flaps that allow the dwellers to control the chimney effect to expel smoke from their fires. Old-style traditional linings were hides, blankets, and rectangular pieces of cloth hanging about above the ground tied to the poles or a rope.

=== Decoration ===
Historically, most tipis in a village were not painted. Painted tipis often depicted noteworthy historical battles and often featured geometric portrayals of celestial bodies and animal designs. Sometimes tipis have been painted to depict personal experiences such as war, hunting, a dream, or vision. When depicting visions, &quot;ceremonies and prayers were first offered, and then the dreamer recounted his dream to the priests and wise men of the community. Those known to be skilled painters were consulted, and the new design was made to fit anonymously within the traditional framework of the tribe&#x27;s painted tipis.&quot;

During the later reservation era, retired warriors would paint on canvas tipis depicting different events in tribal history, including battles with Americans. He Nupa Wanica (Joseph No Two Horns), a Hunkpapa Lakota warrior who fought in 40 battles, including the Battle of the Little Bighorn, is one such artist known for his many tipi paintings, shields and horse effigies now in museums.

===Teachings===

Tribes today use the tipi as a means to convey traditional, scientific, and psychological teachings. The Siksika (Blackfoot) nation&#x27;s worldview is based on the shape of a tipi, which inspired Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs teachings. In Cree communities, the tipi can represent the power of women and their role as the foundation of the family unit. In Lakota communities, youth are taught how to assemble tipis, with each pole representing different traditional virtues, and are simultaneously taught geometry and teamwork.

<text>Byker Grove is a British teen drama and coming of age television series which aired between 1989 and 2006 as part of CBBC on BBC One.

The show was set in Byker, Newcastle upon Tyne and was filmed in nearby Benwell. It was created by writer Adele Rose and executive producer Andrea Wonfor. The show was broadcast at 5:10 pm after &quot;Newsround&quot; (later moved to 5 pm). It was aimed at an older teenager and young adult audience, tackling serious and sometimes controversial storylines. The show is notable for depicting the first gay kiss on children’s television, as well as its breach of the fourth wall in the final series.

==History==
The show ran between 1989 and 2006, and was set in a youth club in the Byker district of Newcastle upon Tyne, England. In 1987, Wonfor approached soap writer Adele Rose and together they created a single pilot episode featuring children aged 8–11 at an out-of-school club that had been commissioned for ITV&#x27;s &quot;Dramarama&quot;. In autumn 1988, Wonfor gained the backing of Anna Home, then Head of the Children&#x27;s Department at BBC Television. Home gave the go ahead for a run of a series of six 25-minute episodes to be broadcast by the BBC. The age of the main characters was raised to 12–16 after support from first producer-director, Matthew Robinson. The first series centred on young teenagers growing from childhood to adulthood.

In July 2023, Ant &amp; Dec, who previously played characters PJ &amp; Duncan in the series, revealed they would be producing a reboot of the programme in 2024, under the name &quot;Byker,&quot; in conjunction with production companies Mitre Studios (their own production company, named after the filming location for the programme) and Fulwell 73. Executive producers will include Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly.

==Production==

&quot;Byker Grove&quot; was not filmed in the Byker area of Newcastle. The actual youth club set was in Benwell, which is in the west area of the city, Byker being in the east. Byker Metro station (the suburban rail network in Newcastle and the Tyne and Wear area) and other landmarks in the real Byker (such as the Byker Wall and surrounding estate) were used for filming backdrops.

The youth club building seen on-screen is The Mitre, which used to be a nightclub and a pub (which was mentioned in a few storylines from episodes in the late 1990s). After the success of the first series (6 episodes, 1989), The Mitre was bought by the BBC&#x27;s London property department, which then granted Zenith Television a permanent licence to film the series there.

Scenes representing Denton Burn Youth Club for Series 15 were filmed at Raby Street Youth Club, in the buildings next to Byker Primary School. This is the real youth club for the children of Byker.

On 11 May 2006, the BBC announced that the series would be ending after 17 years. Filming wrapped on 24 August, and the final series, moved to the CBBC Channel, started on 7 October 2006. Shortly after the announcement Richard Deverell, head of CBBC, was interviewed on &quot;Newsround&quot; about the decision to axe &quot;Byker Grove&quot;.

On 11 March 2008, it was reported that Gallowgate Productions, the TV production company owned by Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, purchased the rights to &quot;Byker Grove&quot;.

===Cast===
&quot;Byker Grove&quot; launched the careers of Anthony McPartlin (&quot;P.J.&quot;) and Declan Donnelly (&quot;Duncan&quot;), who are otherwise known as Ant &amp; Dec, as well as the actress Jill Halfpenny, Donna Air, former CBBC presenter Andrew Hayden-Smith and &quot;Emmerdale&quot; actors Dale Meeks, Charlie Hardwick, Chelsea Halfpenny, Laura Norton and Victoria Hawkins. Also appearing in the series was the now glamour model Francoise Boufhal (&quot;Ellie Baines&quot;) and Charlie Hunnam, who later starred in the American TV series &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot; and co-starred in &quot;Pacific Rim&quot; (2013).

The cast and crew from the first 10 years of the show held their first reunion on 19 May 2012 in the Quayside area of Newcastle upon Tyne and on a river boat cruise.

===Production team===
The founder producer/director (1989–95) was Matthew Robinson. After being promoted to become executive producer of &quot;Byker Grove&quot; for two years (1995–97), he became executive producer of &quot;EastEnders&quot;, then Head of Drama for BBC Wales, and now runs Khmer Mekong Films in Cambodia. &quot;Byker Grove&quot; was also home to writers such as Catherine Johnson (who went on to pen &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot;, the ABBA musical) and Matthew Graham (&quot;This Life&quot;, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and co-creator of BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Life on Mars&quot;). The first writer was Adele Rose–in Series 1 she wrote episodes 1–4 and 6; her daughter, Carrie Rose, wrote episode 5. The most prolific writer was Brian B. Thompson, who wrote 50 episodes over 12 series. &quot;Byker Grove&quot; gave Academy Award-winning director Tom Hooper his first break into TV drama when he directed four episodes in 1997.

==Storylines==
&quot;Byker Grove&quot; was not intended for young children, but aimed at a young adult and teenage audience, as it tackled controversial subjects such as drug addiction, child abuse, homelessness, teen pregnancy, homophobia and abortion. Although some of the action took place outside the youth club, the series was unusual among dramas in that the characters were rarely shown in school. One of the major settings was the foster home run by the kindly but strict Lou Gallagher, the longest-running character. &quot;Byker Grove&quot; was included by &quot;The Guardian&quot; in a 2018 list of &quot;definitive&quot; shows for teenagers; Iman Amrani describes it as &quot;the north&#x27;s answer to &quot;Grange Hill&quot;&quot;, praising its &quot;gritty&quot; writing, which took on difficult topics such as sexual relationships (including those which were same sex) and foster care.

In November 1994, &quot;Byker Grove&quot; featured the first gay kiss on UK children&#x27;s television. It broached the subject of &quot;coming out&quot; when Noddy Fishwick kissed his close friend Gary Hendrix at the back of a cinema. This scene caused outrage in the British tabloids and calls for producer Matthew Robinson to be sacked. However, the BBC strongly backed the storyline, which received countrywide support from gay teenagers, many teachers, and parents. The 2004 series saw the character of Bradley agonising over his sexuality and eventually coming out as gay to his girlfriend Sadie, after a romantic holiday together had failed to live up to their expectations.

The series frequently depicted life as unjust, with bad things happening to good people, such as Flora&#x27;s death from a brain tumour, Greg&#x27;s fall from the roof of the Grove which left him paralysed from the waist down, Jemma Dobson being electrocuted by a faulty electricity mains socket and youth leader Geoff Keegan&#x27;s death in an accidental gas explosion after 11 years on the show.

&quot;Byker Grove&quot; frequently confronted viewers with repercussions for the characters&#x27; actions, often permanent. These ranged from the comical to the tragic; characters who stole and joy-rode cars often died in them, starting with Gill, and ultimately Craig running over Ben Carter. P.J. was blinded during an illicit and unsupervised paintballing session, in which he ignored warnings and removed his face guard, in a scene filmed on location at Aydon Castle near Corbridge.

The central storyline of the first three series was the character of London teenager Julie Warner (Lucy Walsh) struggling to fit in and adjust to life in working class Newcastle and her relationship with the rebellious Martin &quot;Gill&quot; Gillespie. In the show&#x27;s final episode the characters discover that they do not exist and are the creation of unseen characters known as &quot;The Writers&quot; who plan to conclude the show by demolishing the Grove. However numerous present and former Grove members buy enough time for the characters to re-write the ending so that the club will remain open forever, but ultimately fail to stop it being demolished.

Until Series 10 (1998) the rival youth club was known as Denton Burn. In Series 13 (2001) rival youth club members were known as the Denwell Burners as they were from a youth club in Denwell Burn. This is a fictitious area of Newcastle upon Tyne, the name coming from a mixture of Benwell and Denton Burn.

==The bands of &quot;Byker Grove&quot;==
A number of musical acts have been spun off from the series. These include:
* Michelle Charles (under the guise of Charley, which was her character name) – &quot;The Best Thing&quot;, &quot;For the Good Times&quot;
* PJ &amp; Duncan — who became Ant &amp; Dec for &quot;The Cult of...&quot; album (Singles include &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Ready to Rhumble&quot;, &quot;Better Watch Out&quot;, &quot;We&#x27;re On The Ball&quot;)
* Byker Grooove – girl band starring Donna Air (&#x27;Charlie&#x27;), Jayni Hoy (&#x27;Leah&#x27;) and Vicky Taylor (&#x27;Angel&#x27;) whose single &quot;Love Your Sexy...!!&quot; reached No. 48 on the UK Singles Chart in December 1994. Byker Grooove evolved into the duo Crush with Jayni Hoy and Donna Air. (Singles included &quot;Jellyhead&quot; (UK No. 50) and &quot;Luv&#x27;d Up&quot; (UK No. 45) on Telstar Records.) In the United States, where &quot;Byker Grove&quot; did not air and nor was the Crush duo promoted as being associated with the series, &quot;Jellyhead&quot; reached No. 72 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in December 1996. The song &quot;Jellyhead&quot; also charted in Australia from early February 1997, peaking at No. 32 in early April 1997, spending 23 weeks within the ARIA Top 100 Singles chart, 13 of which were in the Top 50.
* Summer Matthews – aka Emma Miller (Single: &quot;Little Miss Perfect&quot;)
* Point Break, boyband featuring Brett Adams (&#x27;Noddy&#x27;) and David Oliver (&#x27;Marcus&#x27;). (Singles include &quot;Do We Rock&quot;, &quot;Stand Tough&quot;, and &quot;Freakytime&quot; on Eternal Records.)

Other bands connected to &quot;Byker Grove&quot; include:
* Freefaller – includes David Oliver of Point Break
* Kane Gang – writers of the original theme music, a development from the &quot;Ooh Gary Davies on your radio&quot; jingle for BBC Radio 1.
* Kenickie - bassist Emmy Kate Montrose appeared in the series, credited under her real name Emma Jackson.

==List of characters==
===Grove staff===
There have been several youth leaders working at the Grove over the years. The following is a list of all the ones shown on-screen.

===Grove members===
This is a list of characters who appeared in the show as members of the Grove from 1989 to 2006. (When surname is not listed, it is either unknown, or was never mentioned in the show)

* Indicates character was still in the show when it finished.

+ In the books that accompanied the series, Duncan&#x27;s surname was listed as MacDonald until 1992, despite it being stated in the show in his 1st appearance (Series 1, Episode 3) that it is Sperring.

===Parents===
Although most of the action took place in the Grove, several characters&#x27; home lives and families were also shown. Some families remained in the show for many years. The house next door to the Grove was home to the Dobson family (1990–93) followed by the Turnbulls (1993–97) and then the Watsons (1998–2000). Other long-running families included the O&#x27;Hagans, the Carters and the various children at Lou Gallagher&#x27;s foster home.

<doc id="236018" wikidata="Q1757254" url="?curid=236018" title="Okeh Records">
<text>OKeh Records () is an American record label founded by the Otto Heinemann Phonograph Corporation, a phonograph supplier established in 1916, which branched out into phonograph records in 1918. The name originally was spelled &quot;OkeH&quot; from the initials of Otto K. E. Heinemann but was later changed to &quot;OKeh&quot;. In 1965, OKeh became a subsidiary of Epic Records, a subsidiary of Sony Music. OKeh has since become a jazz imprint, distributed by Sony Masterworks.

==Early history==

OKeh was founded by Otto (Jehuda) Karl Erich Heinemann (Lüneburg, Germany, 20 December 1876 – New York, USA, 13 September 1965) a German-American manager for the U.S. branch of Odeon Records, which was owned by Carl Lindstrom. In 1916, Heinemann incorporated the Otto Heinemann Phonograph Corporation, set up a recording studio and pressing plant in New York City, and started the label in 1918.

The first discs were vertical cut, but later the more common lateral-cut method was used. The label&#x27;s parent company was renamed the General Phonograph Corporation, and the name on its record labels was changed to OKeh. The common 10-inch discs retailed for 75 cents each, the 12-inch discs for $1.25. The company&#x27;s musical director was Frederick W. Hager, who was also credited under the pseudonym Milo Rega.

OKeh issued popular songs, dance numbers, and vaudeville skits similar to other labels, but Heinemann also wanted to provide music for audiences neglected by the larger record companies. OKeh produced lines of recordings in German, Czech, Polish, Swedish, and Yiddish for immigrant communities in the United States. Some were pressed from masters leased from European labels, while others were recorded by OKeh in New York.

OKeh&#x27;s early releases included music by the New Orleans Jazz Band. In 1920, Perry Bradford encouraged Fred Hager, the director of artists and repertoire (A&amp;R), to record blues singer Mamie Smith. The records were popular, and the label issued a series of race records directed by Clarence Williams in New York City and Richard M. Jones in Chicago. From 1921 to 1932, this series included music by Williams, Lonnie Johnson, King Oliver, and Louis Armstrong. Also recording for the label were Bix Beiderbecke, Lillie Delk Christian, Bennie Moten, Frankie Trumbauer, and Eddie Lang. One of the more popular series was Louis Armstrong&#x27;s Hot Five and Hot Seven, who recorded about 3 sessions per year between 1925 and 1928, which included popular hits such as &quot;Heebie Jeebies&quot;, &quot;Cornet Chop Suey&quot;, and &quot;West End Blues&quot;. After the success of these records, Armstrong&#x27;s records were transferred to the popular series as well, which was marketed towards a white audience in 1928. As part of the Carl Lindström Company, OKeh&#x27;s recordings were distributed by other labels owned by Lindstrom, including Parlophone in the UK. While musicians did not receive much payment for entering the studio, they copyrighted the songs they did record with the hopes that other bands would record the piece; in turn, they would make a steady stream from royalties

In 1926, OKeh was sold to Columbia Records. Ownership changed to the American Record Corporation (ARC) in 1934, and the race records series from the 1920s ended. CBS bought the company in 1938. OKeh was a label for rhythm and blues during the 1950s, but jazz albums continued to be released, as in the work of Wild Bill Davis and Red Saunders.

==The OKeh Laughing Record==
&quot;The OKeh Laughing Record&quot; was recorded in Germany by Beka Records in 1920, by most accounts, and then purchased from that record label by OKeh Records in the US. It features who are likely opera singer Lucie Bernardo and Otto Rathke simply laughing for nearly three minutes while accompanied by cornetist Felix Silbers. They recorded six recordings on the same day. It became a best-seller in the US in 1922, and is estimated to have sold around a million records. OKeh Records soon followed with the &quot;Second Laughing Record&quot;, &quot;The OKeh Laughing Dance Record&quot; and &quot;The OKeh Crying Record&quot;. Other record labels also released similar records. It may have influenced studios to include live audiences and laugh tracks in their shows. It was issued in the UK as &quot;The Parlophone Laughing Record&quot; and it was featured extensively in the Walter Lantz Productions/Universal Studios 1955 cartoon short &quot;Sh-h-h-h-h-h&quot;, the last short directed by Tex Avery.

==Race records and remote recording==
General Phonograph Corporation used Mamie Smith&#x27;s popular song &quot;Crazy Blues&quot; to cultivate a new market in 1920 and they could not keep the record on the shelves because of its popularity. Portraits of Smith and lists of her records were printed in advertisements in newspapers such as the &quot;Chicago Defender&quot;, the &quot;Atlanta Independent&quot;, &quot;New York Colored News&quot;, and others popular with African-Americans (though Smith&#x27;s records were part of OKeh&#x27;s regular 4000 series). Okeh had further prominence in the demographic, as African-American musicians Sara Martin, Eva Taylor, Shelton Brooks, Esther Bigeou, and Handy&#x27;s Orchestra recorded for the label. OKeh issued the 8000 series for race records. The success of this series led OKeh to start recording music where it was being performed, known as remote recording or location recording. Starting in 1923, OKeh sent mobile recording equipment to tour the country and record performers not heard in New York or Chicago. Regular trips were made once or twice a year to New Orleans, Atlanta, San Antonio, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Detroit. The OKeh studio in Atlanta also catered to what was called, &quot;Hillbilly&quot; (now Country) stars at that time. One of the first was &quot;Fiddlin&#x27;&quot; John Carson, who is believed to have made the first country music recordings there in June 1923. A double sided record with &quot;The Little Old Log Cabin in the Lane&quot; and &quot;The Old Hen Cackled and the Rooster&#x27;s Going To Crow.&quot;

==1940–1970==
OKeh releases were infrequent after 1932, although the label continued into 1935. In 1940, after Columbia lost the rights to the Vocalion name by dropping the Brunswick label, the OKeh name was revived to replace it, and the script logo was introduced on a demonstration record announcing that event. The label was again discontinued in 1946 and revived again in 1951.

In 1953, OKeh became an exclusive R&amp;B label when its parent, Columbia, transferred OKeh&#x27;s pop music artists to the newly formed Epic Records. OKeh&#x27;s music publishing division was renamed April Music.

In 1963, Carl Davis became OKeh&#x27;s A&amp;R manager and improved OKeh&#x27;s sales for a couple of years. Epic took over management of Okeh in 1965. Among the artists during OKeh&#x27;s pop phase of the 1950s and 1960s were Johnnie Ray and Little Joe &amp; the Thrillers.

With soul music becoming popular in the 1960s, OKeh signed Major Lance, who gave the label two big successes with &quot;The Monkey Time&quot; and &quot;Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um&quot;. Fifties rocker Larry Williams found a musical home at OKeh for a period of time in the 1960s, recording and producing funky soul with a band that included Johnny &quot;Guitar&quot; Watson. He was paired with Little Richard, who had been persuaded to return to secular music. Williams produced two Little Richard albums for OKeh in 1966 and 1967, which returned Little Richard to the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart for the first time in ten years and produced the hit single &quot;Poor Dog&quot;. He also acted as the music director for Little Richard&#x27;s live performances at the OKeh Club in Los Angeles. Bookings for Little Richard during this period skyrocketed. Williams also recorded and released material of his own and with Watson, with some moderate chart success.

Much of the success of OKeh in the 1960s was dependent on producer Carl Davis and songwriter Curtis Mayfield. After they left the label (due to disputes with Epic/OKeh head Len Levy), OKeh sales gradually slipped, and the label was quietly retired by Columbia in 1970.

==1993–2000==
In 1993, Sony Music reactivated the OKeh label (under distribution by Epic Records) as a new-age blues label. OKeh&#x27;s first new signings included G. Love &amp; Special Sauce, Keb&#x27; Mo, Popa Chubby, and Little Axe. Throughout the first year, in celebration of the relaunch, singles for G. Love, Popa Chubby and Keb&#x27; Mo were released on 10-inch vinyl. By 2000, the OKeh label was again retired, and G. Love &amp; Special Sauce was moved to Epic. It was re-launched in 2013 as a jazz line under Sony Masterworks.

==Since 2013==
In January 2013, Sony Music reactivated the OKeh label as Sony&#x27;s primary jazz imprint under Sony Masterworks. The imprint is part of Sony Masterworks in the U.S., Sony Classical&#x27;s domestic branch, focusing on both new and established artists who embody &quot;global expressions in jazz&quot;. The new artists include David Sanborn, Bob James, Bill Frisell, Regina Carter, Somi, and Dhafer Youssef.

==Ownership==
Sony Music Entertainment owns the global rights to the OKeh Records catalogue through Epic Records and Sony&#x27;s Legacy Recordings reissue subsidiary. EMI&#x27;s rights to the OKeh catalogue in the UK expired in 1968, and CBS Records took over distribution.

<text>Elliptic geometry is an example of a geometry in which Euclid&#x27;s parallel postulate does not hold. Instead, as in spherical geometry, there are no parallel lines since any two lines must intersect. However, unlike in spherical geometry, two lines are usually assumed to intersect at a single point (rather than two). Because of this, the elliptic geometry described in this article is sometimes referred to as &quot;single elliptic geometry&quot; whereas spherical geometry is sometimes referred to as &quot;double elliptic geometry&quot;.

The appearance of this geometry in the nineteenth century stimulated the development of non-Euclidean geometry generally, including hyperbolic geometry.

Elliptic geometry has a variety of properties that differ from those of classical Euclidean plane geometry. For example, the sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always greater than 180°.

==Definitions==
Elliptic geometry may be derived from spherical geometry by identifying antipodal points of the sphere to a single elliptic point. The elliptic lines correspond to great circles reduced by the identification of antipodal points. As any two great circles intersect, there are no parallel lines in elliptic geometry.

In elliptic geometry, two lines perpendicular to a given line must intersect. In fact, all perpendiculars to a given line intersect at a single point called the &quot;absolute pole&quot; of that line.

Every point corresponds to an &quot;absolute polar line&quot; of which it is the absolute pole. Any point on this polar line forms an &quot;absolute conjugate pair&quot; with the pole. Such a pair of points is &quot;orthogonal&quot;, and the distance between them is a &quot;quadrant&quot;.

The distance between a pair of points is proportional to the angle between their absolute polars.

As explained by H. S. M. Coxeter:
:The name &quot;elliptic&quot; is possibly misleading. It does not imply any direct connection with the curve called an ellipse, but only a rather far-fetched analogy. A central conic is called an ellipse or a hyperbola according as it has no asymptote or two asymptotes. Analogously, a non-Euclidean plane is said to be elliptic or hyperbolic according as each of its lines contains no point at infinity or two points at infinity.

==Two dimensions==

===Elliptic plane===
The elliptic plane is the real projective plane provided with a metric. Kepler and Desargues used the gnomonic projection to relate a plane σ to points on a hemisphere tangent to it. With &quot;O&quot; the center of the hemisphere, a point &quot;P&quot; in σ determines a line &quot;OP&quot; intersecting the hemisphere, and any line &quot;L&quot; ⊂ σ determines a plane &quot;OL&quot; which intersects the hemisphere in half of a great circle. The hemisphere is bounded by a plane through O and parallel to σ. No ordinary line of &quot;σ&quot; corresponds to this plane; instead a line at infinity is appended to &quot;σ&quot;. As any line in this extension of σ corresponds to a plane through &quot;O&quot;, and since any pair of such planes intersects in a line through &quot;O&quot;, one can conclude that any pair of lines in the extension intersect: the point of intersection lies where the plane intersection meets σ or the line at infinity. Thus the axiom of projective geometry, requiring all pairs of lines in a plane to intersect, is confirmed.

Given &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; in &quot;σ&quot;, the elliptic distance between them is the measure of the angle &quot;POQ&quot;, usually taken in radians. Arthur Cayley initiated the study of elliptic geometry when he wrote &quot;On the definition of distance&quot;. This venture into abstraction in geometry was followed by Felix Klein and Bernhard Riemann leading to non-Euclidean geometry and Riemannian geometry.

===Comparison with Euclidean geometry===

In Euclidean geometry, a figure can be scaled up or scaled down indefinitely, and the resulting figures are similar, i.e., they have the same angles and the same internal proportions. In elliptic geometry, this is not the case. For example, in the spherical model we can see that the distance between any two points must be strictly less than half the circumference of the sphere (because antipodal points are identified). A line segment therefore cannot be scaled up indefinitely.

A great deal of Euclidean geometry carries over directly to elliptic geometry. For example, the first and fourth of Euclid&#x27;s postulates, that there is a unique line between any two points and that all right angles are equal, hold in elliptic geometry. Postulate 3, that one can construct a circle with any given center and radius, fails if &quot;any radius&quot; is taken to mean &quot;any real number&quot;, but holds if it is taken to mean &quot;the length of any given line segment&quot;. Therefore any result in Euclidean geometry that follows from these three postulates will hold in elliptic geometry, such as proposition 1 from book I of the &quot;Elements&quot;, which states that given any line segment, an equilateral triangle can be constructed with the segment as its base.

Elliptic geometry is also like Euclidean geometry in that space is continuous, homogeneous, isotropic, and without boundaries. Isotropy is guaranteed by the fourth postulate, that all right angles are equal. For an example of homogeneity, note that Euclid&#x27;s proposition I.1 implies that the same equilateral triangle can be constructed at any location, not just in locations that are special in some way. The lack of boundaries follows from the second postulate, extensibility of a line segment.

One way in which elliptic geometry differs from Euclidean geometry is that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is greater than 180 degrees. In the spherical model, for example, a triangle can be constructed with vertices at the locations where the three positive Cartesian coordinate axes intersect the sphere, and all three of its internal angles are 90 degrees, summing to 270 degrees. For sufficiently small triangles, the excess over 180 degrees can be made arbitrarily small.

The Pythagorean theorem fails in elliptic geometry. In the 90°–90°–90° triangle described above, all three sides have the same length, and consequently do not satisfy formula_1. The Pythagorean result is recovered in the limit of small triangles.

The ratio of a circle&#x27;s circumference to its area is smaller than in Euclidean geometry. In general, area and volume do not scale as the second and third powers of linear dimensions.

==Elliptic space (the 3D case)==
&quot;Note: This section uses the term &quot;elliptic space&quot; to refer specifically to 3-dimensional elliptic geometry. This is in contrast to the previous section, which was about 2-dimensional elliptic geometry. The quaternions are used to elucidate this space.&quot;

Elliptic space can be constructed in a way similar to the construction of three-dimensional vector space: with equivalence classes. One uses directed arcs on great circles of the sphere. As directed line segments are equipollent when they are parallel, of the same length, and similarly oriented, so directed arcs found on great circles are equipollent when they are of the same length, orientation, and great circle. These relations of equipollence produce 3D vector space and elliptic space, respectively.

Access to elliptic space structure is provided through the vector algebra of William Rowan Hamilton: he envisioned a sphere as a domain of square roots of minus one. Then Euler&#x27;s formula formula_2 (where &quot;r&quot; is on the sphere) represents the great circle in the plane containing 1 and &quot;r&quot;. Opposite points &quot;r&quot; and –&quot;r&quot; correspond to oppositely directed circles. An arc between θ and φ is equipollent with one between 0 and φ – θ. In elliptic space, arc length is less than π, so arcs may be parametrized with θ in [0, π) or (–π/2, π/2].

For formula_3 It is said that the modulus or norm of &quot;z&quot; is one (Hamilton called it the tensor of z). But since &quot;r&quot; ranges over a sphere in 3-space, exp(θ r) ranges over a sphere in 4-space, now called the 3-sphere, as its surface has three dimensions. Hamilton called his algebra quaternions and it quickly became a useful and celebrated tool of mathematics. Its space of four dimensions is evolved in polar co-ordinates formula_4 with &quot;t&quot; in the positive real numbers.

When doing trigonometry on Earth or the celestial sphere, the sides of the triangles are great circle arcs. The first success of quaternions was a rendering of spherical trigonometry to algebra. Hamilton called a quaternion of norm one a versor, and these are the points of elliptic space.

With fixed, the versors 
:formula_5
form an &quot;elliptic line&quot;. The distance from formula_6 to 1 is . For an arbitrary versor , the distance will be that θ for which since this is the formula for the scalar part of any quaternion.

An &quot;elliptic motion&quot; is described by the quaternion mapping
:formula_7 where and are fixed versors.
Distances between points are the same as between image points of an elliptic motion. In the case that and are quaternion conjugates of one another, the motion is a spatial rotation, and their vector part is the axis of rotation. In the case the elliptic motion is called a right &quot;Clifford translation&quot;, or a &quot;parataxy&quot;. The case corresponds to left Clifford translation.

&quot;Elliptic lines&quot; through versor  may be of the form
:formula_8 or formula_9 for a fixed .
They are the right and left Clifford translations of  along an elliptic line through 1.
The &quot;elliptic space&quot; is formed from by identifying antipodal points.

Elliptic space has special structures called Clifford parallels and Clifford surfaces.

The versor points of elliptic space are mapped by the Cayley transform to formula_10 for an alternative representation of the space.

==Higher-dimensional spaces==

===Hyperspherical model===
The hyperspherical model is the generalization of the spherical model to higher dimensions. The points of &quot;n&quot;-dimensional elliptic space are the pairs of unit vectors in R&quot;n&quot;+1, that is, pairs of antipodal points on the surface of the unit ball in -dimensional space (the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional hypersphere). Lines in this model are great circles, i.e., intersections of the hypersphere with flat hypersurfaces of dimension &quot;n&quot; passing through the origin.

===Projective elliptic geometry===
In the projective model of elliptic geometry, the points of &quot;n&quot;-dimensional real projective space are used as points of the model. This models an abstract elliptic geometry that is also known as projective geometry.

The points of &quot;n&quot;-dimensional projective space can be identified with lines through the origin in -dimensional space, and can be represented non-uniquely by nonzero vectors in R&quot;n&quot;+1, with the understanding that and , for any non-zero scalar , represent the same point. Distance is defined using the metric
:formula_11
that is, the distance between two points is the angle between their corresponding lines in R&quot;n&quot;+1. The distance formula is homogeneous in each variable, with if and are non-zero scalars, so it does define a distance on the points of projective space.

A notable property of the projective elliptic geometry is that for even dimensions, such as the plane, the geometry is non-orientable. It erases the distinction between clockwise and counterclockwise rotation by identifying them.

===Stereographic model===
A model representing the same space as the hyperspherical model can be obtained by means of stereographic projection. Let E&quot;n&quot; represent that is, -dimensional real space extended by a single point at infinity. We may define a metric, the &quot;chordal metric&quot;, on
E&quot;n&quot; by
:formula_12
where and are any two vectors in R&quot;n&quot; and formula_13 is the usual Euclidean norm. We also define
:formula_14
The result is a metric space on E&quot;n&quot;, which represents the distance along a chord of the corresponding points on the hyperspherical model, to which it maps bijectively by stereographic projection. We obtain a model of spherical geometry if we use the metric
:formula_15
Elliptic geometry is obtained from this by identifying the antipodal points and , and taking the distance from to this pair to be the minimum of the distances from to each of these two points.

==Self-consistency==
Because spherical elliptic geometry can be modeled as, for example, a spherical subspace of a Euclidean space, it follows that if Euclidean geometry is self-consistent, so is spherical elliptic geometry. Therefore it is not possible to prove the parallel postulate based on the other four postulates of Euclidean geometry.

Tarski proved that elementary Euclidean geometry is complete: there is an algorithm which, for every proposition, can show it to be either true or false. (This does not violate Gödel&#x27;s theorem, because Euclidean geometry cannot describe a sufficient amount of arithmetic for the theorem to apply.) It therefore follows that elementary elliptic geometry is also self-consistent and complete.

<text>The mellophone is a brass instrument used in marching bands and drum and bugle corps in place of French horns. It is a middle-voiced instrument, typically pitched in the key of F, though models in E, D, C, and G (as a bugle) have also historically existed. It has a conical bore, like that of the euphonium and flugelhorn. It can also be used to play French horn parts in concert bands and orchestras.

These instruments are used instead of French horns for marching because their bells face forward instead of to the back (or to the side), as dissipation of the sound becomes a concern in the open-air environment of marching. Tuning is done solely by adjusting the tuning slide, unlike the French horn where the pitch is affected by the hand position in the bell. Fingerings for the mellophone are the same as fingerings for the trumpet, tenor horn, and most valved brass instruments. Owing to its use primarily outside concert music, there is little solo literature for the mellophone, other than that used within drum and bugle corps, and a single concerto written for the instrument. 

==Characteristics ==
The present-day mellophone has three valves, operated with the right hand (1- and 2- valve mellophone bugles have been used in the past). Mellophone fingerings are the same as the trumpet. It is typically pitched lower, in the key of F or E. The overtone series of the F mellophone is an octave above that of the F horn. The tubing length of a mellophone is the same as that of the F-alto (high) single horn or the F-alto (high) branch of a triple horn or double-descant horn.

The direction of the bell as well as the much-reduced amount of tubing (compared to a French horn) make the mellophone look like a large trumpet. The mouthpiece of a mellophone is in between the size of a trombone and trumpet mouthpiece. This mouthpiece usually has a deep cup, like that of the flugelhorn, and has a wider inner diameter than a trumpet mouthpiece. These mouthpieces give the mellophone a dark, round sound. Some trumpet players who double on mellophone use a trumpet-style parabolic (&quot;cup&quot;) mouthpiece on the instrument, resulting in a much brighter, more trumpet-like sound. Horn players doubling on mellophone often use a smaller, lighter, conical (&quot;funnel&quot;) mouthpiece, as used on French horns, with an adapter to allow them to fit in the larger-bore leadpipe of the mellophone. This style mouthpiece gives the instrument a warmer sound than using a trumpet mouthpiece, and allows French horn players to play the mellophone without changing their embouchure between the two instruments.

== History ==
Two instruments carry the name mellophone:
# Traditional &quot;Concert&quot; or &quot;Classic&quot; mellophones with a rear or sideways facing bell similar to the french horn.
# The marching mellophone, with a forward-facing bell.

In general, the mellophone has its origin in the horn design boom of the 19th century. The earliest version was the Koenig horn, based on a design by Herman Koenig, but manufactured by Antoine Courtois, who may also have played a significant role in its design. Courtois had just won the right to manufacture the saxhorn, in a lawsuit against the inventor of the saxophone, Adolphe Sax. The Koenig horn had three piston valves — the kind used on a modern trumpet, which were a relatively new technology at that time — and was otherwise shaped somewhat like a modern French horn, but smaller. This shape was largely influenced by the post horn.

Köhler &amp; Son originally began using the name &quot;mellophone&quot; for its line of horns based loosely on similar instruments by Distin. These were also post horn-like instruments with valves, but the mouthpieces and bell angle were slowly evolving to allow for more projection and control of sound with the technology of valves.

The traditional instrument is visually modeled on the horn, with a round shape and a rear-facing bell and has come to be known as a &quot;classic&quot; or &quot;concert&quot; mellophone. Unlike French horns, it is played with the right hand, and the bell points to the rear left of the player and is generally keyed in F with facility to switch to Eb. Older instruments often included the capability of playing in the key of D and/or C as well. It was used as an alto voice both outdoors and indoors by community and school bands in place of the French horn. The manufacture of these instruments declined significantly in the mid-twentieth century, and they are rarely in use today. In some instances these are called a Tenor Cor.

Mellophone bugles keyed in G were manufactured for American drum and bugle corps from approximately the 1950s until around 2000 when Drum Corps International changed the rules to allow brass instruments in any key.

Modern marching mellophones are more directly related to bugle-horns such as the flugelhorn, euphonium, and tuba. Their tube profile is likewise more conical than the trumpet or trombone.

== Difference from the horn ==
The marching mellophone is used in place of the horn for marching because it is a bell-front instrument allowing projection of the sound in the direction that the player is facing. This is especially important in drum corps and marching bands because the audience is typically on only one side of the ensemble. Mellophones are usually constructed with a smaller bore for louder volume than marching French horns. There are also marching B French horns with a bell-front configuration; these do use a horn mouthpiece and have a more French horn-like sound, but are more difficult to play accurately on the field.

Another factor in the greater use of mellophones is its ease of use as compared to the difficulty of playing a French horn consistently well. In a French horn, the length of tubing (and the bore size) make the partials much closer together than other brass instruments in their normal range and, therefore, harder to play accurately. The F mellophone has tubing half the length of a French horn, which gives it an overtone series more similar to a trumpet and most other brass instruments.

The mellophone is an instrument designed specifically to bring the approximate sound of a horn in a package which is conducive to playing while marching. Outside a marching setting, the traditional French horn is ubiquitous and the mellophone is rarely used.

== Mellophonium ==
===Stan Kenton&#x27;s instrument===

C.G. Conn developed its 16E &quot;Mellophonium&quot; and first marketed it in 1957. It is essentially a &quot;classic&quot; or &quot;concert&quot; mellophone that has figuratively been partially unwrapped to form a bell forward instrument. American bandleader Stan Kenton himself was not involved in the design of the mellophonium; in 1961, however, he provided an endorsement for Conn&#x27;s advertising upon adopting the instrument. Kenton had, for several years, wished to add another brass voice alongside the trumpets and trombones in his orchestra and experimented unsuccessfully with additional instruments, before discovering the Conn Mellophonium, which bridged the gap he was seeking to fill:

In 1962, Kenton explained: &quot;For some time, I recognized the need for using an instrument that would not only give the orchestra another solo voice, but would add more warmth and emphasis to the thematic line. The Mellophonium has not only met all the preliminary requirements, but has also suggested intriguing new ways to shade and dramatize sound. My decision to use four Mellophoniums didn&#x27;t just happen overnight. Nor are they gimmick instruments. Both the arranging staff and myself realized the need for an instrument that would capture the width of sound that virtually lay untouched between the trumpets and trombones. We first tried ten trumpets—five B flat and five E flat. They didn&#x27;t make it because it was impossible to distinguish any difference between the two instruments...After experimenting for two days with the flugelhorn, we were ready to give it up completely! Finally, the Conn Instrument Corporation learned that we were interested in locating a new brass instrument and asked us to try the mellophonium. After much experimentation and many preliminary rehearsals, the Mellophonium became the answer we had been looking for.&quot;

The instrument could be played by a trumpeter with relative ease, though most Mellophonium players in Kenton&#x27;s band were reluctant users of the instrument due to its difficulty to play in-tune particularly in the higher registers. Several trumpeters quit in protest rather than switch full-time to Mellophonium, and only a few band members preferred the new instrument. Kenton used a four-man mellophonium section September 1960 through November 1963 on 11 albums; two of those LPs received Grammy Awards (&quot;Kenton&#x27;s West Side Story&quot; and &quot;Adventures In Jazz&quot;).

===Bach instrument===

The Vincent Bach Corporation also produced a mellophonium, with the shape of the tubing more reminiscent of the cornet.

===F. E. Olds instrument===

The F. E. Olds company manufactured mellophoniums with the same wrap as the Vincent Bach Corporation design.

===Holton instrument===

The Holton company manufactured mellophoniums with a trumpet like lead pipe and valve assembly with the rest being comparable to a mellophonium.

<text>Emerson Records was an American record company and label created by Victor Emerson in 1915.

Victor Hugo Emerson was the chief recording engineer at Columbia Records. In 1914 he left the company, created the Emerson Phonograph Company, and then Emerson Records the following year. He began producing small records, 5-inch discs that sold for 10 cents and 7-inch discs that sold for 25 cents.

Early discs consisted of popular tunes, dance numbers, and patriotic marches, recorded by musicians in New York City who were credited as the &quot;Emerson Orchestra&quot; or sometimes &quot;The Emerson Symphony Orchestra&quot;. Classical records were made by violinist David Hochstein (his only recordings), pianist Arthur Friedheim, and the orchestra of New York&#x27;s Rialto Theatre under its director Hugo Riesenfeld.

In January 1918 Emerson added a line of 9-inch records that sold for 75 cents. After World War I, Emerson began an ambitious expansion of the business, and in 1919 added a line of industry standard 10-inch discs for 85 cents and increased to one dollar the following year. In 1919 Emerson introduced 12-inch discs, mostly of classical music, for US$1.25.

The label&#x27;s catalog included recordings by Wilbur Sweatman, Eddie Cantor, the Six Brown Brothers, the Louisiana Five, Lizzie Miles, Eubie Blake, Fletcher Henderson, the Original Memphis Five, John W. Myers, Henry Burr and the Peerless Quartet, Billy Golden, Collins &amp; Harlan, Sally Hamlin, Dan W. Quinn, Sam Ash, Vernon Dalhart, Van and Schenck, Ada Jones, and Homer Rodeheaver.

In May 1920, Emerson opened a second recording studio in Los Angeles, California. His expansions over-extended the company&#x27;s finances and forced it into receivership in 1921. In May 1922 investors Benjamin Abrams and Rudolph Kararek purchased the Emerson Company for US$50,000 and raised an additional US$200,000 of capital to revive the business. Emerson discs were then sold for 50 cents each.

In 1924, the investors sold Emerson to the Scranton Button Company of Scranton, Pennsylvania. About this time, electric microphones replaced mechanical recording techniques, and Emerson switched to the new method of sound recording in 1926. Scranton Button Co. halted production of new records by its Emerson subsidiary in 1928, but the company retained the name and later applied it to a line of radios. After about 1924 or 1925, Emerson was no longer a popular label. It seldom recorded any artists of note, mostly standard performers who were jobbing around New York, which explains why the later &quot;Electrosonic Emerson&quot; records are so scarce.

The company also issued race records that were marketed to blacks. These included the 78 &quot;He Wasn&#x27;t Born in Araby, But He&#x27;s a Sheikin&#x27; Fool&quot; b/w &quot;Heart Breakin&#x27; Joe&quot; (1924), recorded by Ethel Finnie.

<text>Lincoln Records was an American record label that existed from 1923 to 1930.

The bulk of material on Lincoln was dance music by bands assembled from the pool of New York musicians. Lincoln Records filled a market niche for people who wanted inexpensive, danceable records of popular tunes and did not particularly care who recorded them. Lincoln records initially retailed for 50 cents each. The label had a drawing of Abraham Lincoln on the top. Although the labels said that they were made by the Lincoln Record Corporation, New York, Lincoln was actually owned by Cameo Records. Some Lincoln issues were pressed from Cameo masters, although the name of the band which recorded for Cameo was usually changed to a pseudonym so that the Lincolns would not compete with those on Cameo.

The Lincoln Records label debuted in 1924 and was discontinued in 1930. It reappeared in 1949, probably revived by the American Record Corporation which had acquired Cameo years earlier. Through the mid-1950s some children&#x27;s records and music by less well known artists was released on 45-rpm discs with the Lincoln name.

Over the years, of those records issued on Cameo and Lincoln, the Cameo records are much more commonly found, making Lincoln a rather scarce label.

Artists on the label included Salt and Pepper, Ray Hamilton, the Lincoln Dance Orchestra, the Broadway Broadcasters, the Hawaiian Gondoliers, The Rangers, and Frances Sper.

<doc id="236033" wikidata="Q1133204" url="?curid=236033" title="Street Fighter II">
<text>is a 1991 fighting game developed and published by Capcom for arcades. It is the second installment in the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series and the sequel to 1987&#x27;s &quot;Street Fighter&quot;. It is the fourteenth game to use Capcom&#x27;s CP System arcade system board. &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; vastly improved many of the concepts introduced in the first game, including the use of special command-based moves, a combo system, a six-button configuration, and a wider selection of playable characters, each with a unique fighting style.

Designed by Yoshiki Okamoto and Akira Yasuda, who had previously worked on &quot;Final Fight&quot;, &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; is regarded as one of the greatest video games of all time and the most important and influential fighting game ever made. Its launch is seen as a revolutionary moment within its genre, credited with popularizing the fighting genre during the 1990s and inspiring other producers to create their own fighting series. Additionally, it prolonged the survival of the declining video game arcade business market by stimulating business and driving the fighting game genre. It prominently features a popular two-player mode that obligates direct, human-to-human competitive play, inspiring grassroots tournament events, culminating in Evolution Championship Series (EVO). &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; shifted the arcade competitive dynamic from achieving personal-best high scores to head-to-head competition, including large groups.

&quot;Street Fighter II&quot; became the best-selling game since the golden age of arcade video games. By 1994, it had been played by an estimated 25 million people in the United States alone. More than 200,000 arcade cabinets and 15million software units of all versions of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; have been sold worldwide, grossing an estimated in total revenue, making it one of the top three highest-grossing video games of all time and the best-selling fighting game until 2019. More than 6.3 million SNES cartridges of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; were sold, making it Capcom&#x27;s best-selling single software game for the next two decades, its best-selling game on a single platform, and the highest-selling third-party game on the SNES. Due to its major success, a series of updated versions were released with additional features and characters, starting with 1992&#x27;s &quot;Street Fighter II: Champion Edition&quot;; its major successor was &quot;Street Fighter III&quot; in 1997.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Street Fighter II&quot; follows several conventions and rules established by its 1987 predecessor &quot;Street Fighter&quot;. The player engages opponents in a series of timed one-on-one, close-quarters combat matches. In order to win a round, the player must either completely drain the opponent&#x27;s health bar by landing attacks, or have more health left than the opponent when the timer runs out. Neither fighter wins the round if they have equal health when time expires or if they simultaneously knock each other out. The first fighter to win two rounds is declared the victor of the match.

While a single-player game is in progress, a second player may join at any time, immediately starting a head-to-head match. The winner continues in single-player mode.

The original &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; allowed up to 10 rounds per match; this maximum is reduced to four rounds starting with &quot;Champion Edition&quot;. If there is no clear winner by the end of the final round, either the computer-controlled opponent will win by default in a single-player match or both fighters will lose in a two-player match. After every third match in the single-player mode, a bonus stage gives a chance to earn additional points by smashing a car, wooden barrels, or metal oil drums. After each match, the location for the next one is selected on a world map.

Like in &quot;Street Fighter&quot;, the controls are an eight-directional joystick and six attack buttons. The joystick can jump, crouch, walk left and right, and block. A tradeoff of strength and speed are given by three punch buttons and three kick buttons, each of light, medium, and heavy. The player can perform a variety of basic moves in any position, including new grabbing and throwing attacks. Special moves are performed by combinations of directional and button-based commands.

&quot;Street Fighter II&quot; differs from its predecessor due to the selection of multiple playable characters, each with distinct fighting styles and special moves including combos. According to &quot;IGN&quot;, &quot;the concept of combinations, linked attacks that can&#x27;t be blocked when they&#x27;re timed correctly, came about more or less by accident. &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;″s designers didn&#x27;t quite mean for it to happen, but players of the original game eventually found out that certain moves naturally flowed into other ones.&quot; This combo system was later adopted as a standard feature of fighting games and was expanded upon in this series.

==Plot==
The leader of the Shadaloo organization, M. Bison, in his global domination plan sets up a world fighting tournament, to select the best fighters to work in his Shadaloo organization through brainwashing.

==Characters==
The original &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; features a roster of eight playable characters. This includes Ryu and Ken—the main protagonists from &quot;Street Fighter&quot;—plus six new international newcomers. In the single-player tournament, the player fights the other seven main fighters, then the final opponentsa group of four CPU-only opponents known as the Grand Masters, which includes Sagat from &quot;Street Fighter&quot;.

Playable characters:

* , a Japanese martial artist seeking no fame or even the crown of &quot;champion&quot;, but only to hone his Ansatsuken Karate skills with the inner power of Chi. He dedicates his life to perfect his own potential while abandoning everything else such as having no family and few friends; his only bond is with Ken. He is the winner of the previous tournament. He is not convinced that he is the greatest fighter in the world and comes to this tournament in search of fresh competition.
* E. Honda, a sumo wrestler from Japan. He aims to improve the negative reputation of sumo wrestling by proving to competitors that he is a legitimate athlete.
* Blanka, a beast-like mutant from Brazil who was raised in the jungle. He enters the tournament to uncover more origins about his forgotten past.
* Guile, a former United States Air Force special forces operative seeking to defeat M. Bison, who killed his best friend Charlie.
* Ken, Ryu&#x27;s best friend, greatest rival and former training partner, from the United States. Ryu&#x27;s personal challenge rekindled Ken&#x27;s fighting spirit and persuaded him to enter the World Warrior tournament, as well as feeling lackadaisical in his fighting potential due to spending too much time with his fiancée.
* Chun-Li, a Chinese martial artist who works as an Interpol officer. Much like Guile, she does not enter the World Warrior tournament for any personal glory except proving that she can defeat any man who challenges her. Chun-Li&#x27;s ambition in the past was tracking down the movements of the smuggling operation known as Shadaloo. Her goal now is her trail being led to the tournament by seeking to avenge her deceased father by holding the &quot;Grand Master&#x27;s&quot; leader of the crime syndicate responsible.
* Zangief, a professional wrestler and sambo fighter from the Soviet Union. He aims to prove &quot;Soviet Strength&quot; is the strongest form of strength, particularly by defeating American opponents with his bare hands.
* Dhalsim, a fire-breathing yoga master from India. Even though he is a pacifist, he uses the money earned from fighting to lift people out of poverty.

CPU-exclusive characters, in the order of appearance:

* Balrog, an American boxer with a similar appearance to Mike Tyson. Called M. Bison in Japan. Once one of the world&#x27;s greatest heavyweight boxers, he began working for Shadaloo for easy money.
* Vega, a Spanish bullfighter who wields a claw and uses a unique style of ninjutsu. Called Balrog in Japan. He is vain and wishes to eliminate ugly people from the world.
* Sagat, a Muay Thai kickboxer from Thailand and former World Warrior champion from the original &quot;Street Fighter&quot;. He was once known as &quot;The King of Street Fighters&quot; until he got demoted as &quot;The King of Muai Thai&quot; in his own tournament due to a narrow defeat at the hands of Ryu&#x27;s &quot;shoryuken&quot; (rising dragon punch) which left a deep gash across his chest. Ever since that moment he felt disgrace, and will do anything to have a grudge match with Ryu to get his title back, even if it takes joining forces with Shadaloo.
* M. Bison, the leader of the criminal organization Shadaloo, who uses a mysterious power known as Psycho Power, and the final opponent of the game. Called Vega in Japan.

Takayuki Nakayama stated in an interview that many character design ideas were trialled and dropped along the development process. Rejected character designs for &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; included another bullfighter and an American amateur wrestler.

==Regional differences==
With the exception of Sagat, the Shadaloo Bosses have different names in the Japanese version. The African-American boxer known as Balrog in the international versions was designed as a pastiche of real-life boxer Mike Tyson and was originally named M. Bison (short for &quot;Mike Bison&quot;, with &quot;Mike&quot; being one of the American opponents faced in &quot;Street Fighter&quot;). Vega and M. Bison were originally named Balrog and Vega, respectively. When &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; was localized for the overseas market, the names of the bosses were rotated, out of concern that the boxer&#x27;s similarities to Tyson could have led to a likeness infringement lawsuit.

The characters in the Japanese version have more than one win quote and if the player loses a match against the CPU in the Japanese version, a random playing tip will be shown at the bottom of the continue screen. While the ending text for the characters was originally translated literally, a few changes were made due to creative differences from Capcom&#x27;s U.S. marketing staff. For example, the name of Guile&#x27;s fallen friend (who later debuted as a playable fighter in &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot;) was changed from Nash to Charlie, since a staff member from Capcom USA said that Nash is not a natural sounding English name.

==Development==
Although the original punching-pad cabinet of &quot;Street Fighter&quot; had not been very popular, the alternate six-button version was more successful, which began to generate interest in a sequel. Capcom began to make fighting games a priority after &quot;Final Fight&quot; was commercially successful in the United States. Yoshiki Okamoto recounted: &quot;The basic idea at Capcom was to revive &quot;Street Fighter&quot;, a good game concept, to make it a better-playing arcade game.&quot;

Development of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; took about two years and about 35 to 40 people, with Noritaka Funamizu as a producer, and Akira Nishitani and Akira Yasuda in charge of the game and character design, respectively. The budget was estimated at .

Funamizu notes that the developers did not particularly prioritize &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;″s balance; he primarily ascribes the game&#x27;s success to its appealing animation patterns. The quality of animation benefited from the developers&#x27; use of the CPS-1 hardware, with advantages including allowing different characters to occupy different amounts of memory. For example, Ryu can occupy 8 megabits and Zangief 12 megabits.

The combo system came about by accident:

The vast majority of in-game music was composed by Yoko Shimomura. This is ultimately the only game in the series on which Shimomura worked, as she left the company for Square two years later. Isao Abe, a Capcom newcomer, handled a few additional tracks (&quot;Versus Screen&quot;, &quot;Sagat&#x27;s Theme&quot;, and &quot;Here Comes A New Challenger&quot;) for &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; and became the main composer on the subsequent versions. The sound programming and sound effects were overseen by Yoshihiro Sakaguchi, the composer on &quot;Street Fighter&quot;.

Location testing began in Japan. It was then exhibited in the United Kingdom at London&#x27;s Amusement Trades Exhibition International (ATEI) in January 1991. The same month, Capcom held a two-week location test in North America, before unveiling the game at Capcom&#x27;s distributor conference on February 1, 1991, held at Marriott Harbor Beach, Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Capcom introduced &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; as its &quot;greatest video game ever&quot;.

==Updated versions==
&quot;Street Fighter II&quot; spawned a series of revisions, each refining the play mechanics, graphics, character roster, and other aspects of the game:

* Street Fighter II: Champion Edition, released in March 1992, rebalances characters&#x27; power levels, allows both players in two-player matches to select the same character (distinguished by alternate costume colors) and allows players to choose the four previously computer-only boss characters. 
* &quot;Street Fighter II Turbo: Hyper Fighting&quot;, released in December 1992, increases the playing speed and gave some characters new special moves. It was created as Capcom&#x27;s official response to a wave of unauthorized modifications for arcade cabinets of &quot;Champion Edition&quot; that appeared throughout 1992, such as the so-called &quot;Rainbow Edition&quot;.
* &quot;Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers&quot;, released in September 1993, used the more advanced CP System II which allowed for updated graphics and audio. It introduces four new characters, but relieved the speed increase of &quot;Street Fighter II Turbo: Hyper Fighting&quot;. 
* Super Street Fighter II Turbo, released in February 1994, combines the improvements of &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot; with the previous &quot;Turbo (Hyper Fighting)&quot; edition. It allows for a selective game speed, introduces powered-up special moves called Super Combos, and adds a new hidden character.

In addition to the official updated versions, numerous counterfeit modified versions of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; were in wide circulation. For example, nine different counterfeit versions were available on the Super Famicom in Japan by December 1992.

All of the &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; arcade games have been ported to various platforms, as individual releases and also in compilations. Later home console ports further reinvented elements from the arcades: Hyper Street Fighter II released in December 2003 (which was later given an arcade release), Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix released in November 2008, and &quot;Ultra Street Fighter II: The Final Challengers&quot; released in May 2017; the latter of which added three additional characters who previously debuted outside the &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; line of titles.

==Ports==
===Super NES===
&quot;Street Fighter II&quot; was released for the Super Famicom on June 10, 1992, in Japan, followed by a North American release for the SNES in August and a European release in December. It is the first game released on a 16-megabit SNES cartridge. Many aspects from the arcade versions were either changed or simplified in order to fit into the smaller memory capacity. This version has a secret code allowing both players to control the same character in a match, which is not possible in the original arcade version. The second player uses the same alternate color palette introduced in &quot;Street Fighter II: Champion Edition&quot;. The four Shadaloo Bosses are still non-playable, but the code enables their &quot;Champion Edition&quot; color palette. Tatsuya Nishimura, who had recently joined Capcom from TOSE, arranged the soundtrack with assistance from Shimomura, Abe, and Sakaguchi.

The American SNES cartridge was re-released in November 2017 as a limited edition item to celebrate the anniversary of the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series.

===Home computers===
U.S. Gold released versions of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; for various home computer platforms in Europe, namely the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, PC (DOS), and ZX Spectrum. These were all developed by Creative Materials, except the ZX Spectrum version by Tiertex Design Studios. The PC version was also published in North America by Hi-Tech Expressions. These versions suffer numerous inaccuracies, such as missing graphical assets and music tracks, miscolored palettes, and lack of six-button controls due to these platforms having only one or two-button joysticks as standard at the time. Though officially advertised by US Gold along with the C64 and ZX Spectrum conversions and anticipated in magazines, the Amstrad CPC development by Creative Materials was canceled.

===Tiger Electronics===
This standalone handheld machine was missing Chun-Li and Dhalsim.

===Game Boy===
The Game Boy version of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; was released on August 11, 1995, in Japan, and in September 1995 internationally. It is missing Dhalsim, E. Honda, and Vega. The graphics, character portraits, and stages are based on &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot;, although some moves (ex: Blanka&#x27;s Amazon River Run) from &quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo&quot; are included. Because the Game Boy only has two buttons, the strength of punches and kicks is determined by the duration of button presses.

===Compilations===
&quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, &quot;Champion Edition&quot;, and &quot;Turbo&quot; are in the compilation &quot;Capcom Generation 5&quot; for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn, which was released in North America and Europe as &quot;Street Fighter Collection 2&quot;. All three games are in &quot;Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 1&quot; for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, and in &quot;Capcom Classics Collection Reloaded&quot; for the PlayStation Portable. In 2011, all three games were released on iOS devices as the &quot;Street Fighter II Collection&quot;, though the compilation was later delisted from the App Store. In 2018, &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; was one of the many games included in the &quot;Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection&quot; for the PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and Windows.

==Reception==
===Commercial===
By 1994, &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; had been played by an estimated 25 million people in the United States alone, across arcades and homes. All versions of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; are estimated to have grossed a total of in revenue, mostly from the arcade market. , it is one of the top three highest-grossing video games of all time, along with &quot;Space Invaders&quot; (1978) and &quot;Pac-Man&quot; (1980).

====Arcade versions====
&quot;Street Fighter II&quot; was not immediately successful in Japan, as most arcade players were initially playing it solo, rather than multiplayer as originally intended. Yoshiki Okamoto was disappointed with its initial performance, and was told he should have produced another solo beat &#x27;em up like &quot;Final Fight&quot; instead. After Japanese arcade magazine &quot;Gamest&quot; began publishing articles informing readers about the &quot;battle play&quot; feature, the game began gaining considerable popularity in Japanese arcades. In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; magazine listed the game on their April 1, 1991 issue as being the second most-successful table arcade cabinet of the month, outperforming games such as &quot;Detana!! TwinBee&quot; and &quot;King of the Monsters&quot;, before &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; topped the charts two weeks later. It went on to become the highest-grossing arcade game of 1991 in Japan, and then it again became the highest-grossing arcade game of 1992. &quot;Street Fighter II Turbo&quot; became the highest-grossing arcade game of 1993, with &quot;Street Fighter II Dash&quot; (&quot;Champion Edition&quot;) at number four and &quot;The World Warrior&quot; at number nine.

&quot;Street Fighter II&quot; was similarly successful in the Western world. In the United States, the game was more immediately successful as it exceeded expectations in test markets, with individual machines earning per week, Capcom USA sales representative Jeff Walker predicted it would &quot;become the kit of 1991&quot; and &quot;RePlay&quot; magazine said the game showed there was &quot;plenty of life&quot; left in the then struggling arcade business. By March, it had become a blockbuster and the top-grossing game in the United States, giving a substantial boost in earnings for street operators. It topped the &quot;RePlay&quot; arcade software charts from May 1991 through August 1992, for a total of 16 months. On the &quot;Play Meter&quot; arcade charts, it was the top-grossing video game during JanuaryFebruary 1992 and May 1992. &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; was the highest-grossing arcade game of 1991 in the United States, and one of the top five highest-grossing arcade conversion kits of 1992 (below &quot;Champion Edition&quot;). Its success was considered phenomenal; by 1992, it had turned around the convenience store segment of the coin-op industry and become the best-selling arcade game in ten years. &quot;Electronic Games&quot; noted in its October 1992 issue, &quot;Not since the early 1980s has an arcade game received so much attention and all-out fanatical popularity.&quot; It was similarly successful in Australia, where it was performing strongly after 16 months on the market, with &quot;Leisure Line&quot; magazine noting in 1992 that not &quot;since the days of &quot;Space Invaders&quot; (1978) has a game had such longevity&quot;.

In 1991, 50,000 arcade units were sold worldwide, including 17,000 units in Japan, with Capcom reporting continued production of arcade units due to repeat orders. In the United Kingdom, &quot;Your Commodore&quot; reported in July 1991 that spectators were betting on players at London West End arcades. Between early 1991 and early 1993, &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; had captured about 60% of the global coin-op market, including 10,000 units installed in the United Kingdom by mid-1991, with individual machines in the UK estimated to be taking between per week over the next two years. &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; generated an estimated annual revenue of in the UK alone for the two years between mid-1991 and mid-1993, totaling ( at the time, equivalent to $ in ).

The company sold more than 60,000 arcade machines of the original &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, including about 20,000 to 25,000 units in the United States. It was followed by &quot;Street Fighter II′&quot; (&quot;Dash&quot; or &quot;Champion Edition&quot;), of which 140,000 arcade units were sold in Japan alone, where it cost ¥160,000 ($1300) for each unit, amounting to ¥22.4 billion ($182 million) revenue generated from hardware sales in Japan (equivalent to $ in ), in addition to about 20,000 to 25,000 units sold in the United States. On the US &quot;RePlay&quot; arcade charts for July 1992, &quot;Champion Edition&quot; was number one on the upright cabinets chart (above Midway&#x27;s &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;) while the original &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; was number two on the coin-op software chart (below SNK&#x27;s &quot;World Heroes&quot;). &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; generated (equivalent to $ in ) annually in 1993, making it the year&#x27;s highest-grossing entertainment product, above the film &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;. In January 1994, Capcom referred to &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; as &quot;the most successful video game series of the decade&quot; while promoting &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot;. In early 1994, Capcom projected sales of &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot; to reach 100,000 arcade units. According to the March 1995 issue of &quot;GameFan&quot;, the game had earned &quot;billions of dollars in profit&quot;.

In addition to Capcom&#x27;s official arcade units, many pirated counterfeit &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; arcade clone units were sold across the world. &quot;RePlay&quot; noted in January 1993 that &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; had &quot;single-handedly re-ignited the worldwide black market in counterfeit PCBs and speed-up kits&quot;. Many counterfeit arcade units often outsold official &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; arcade cabinets in various markets. For example, about 200,000 counterfeits were in Mexico alone, where Capcom did not officially sell the game. Bondeal from Hong Kong produced 3,000 copied arcade units per month for markets like Latin America, and a Taiwanese firm produced 20,000 copied arcade units in 1991; in Taiwan, up to 150,000 clone units were manufactured by 1992. Many counterfeit units were in South Korea, such as a trader selling about 100 &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; PCBs by 1992. Seven different versions of the game claimed to be sequels in 1992, mostly from Hong Kong, and one named &quot;Champion of Champion Editions&quot; reportedly was in British arcades. Capcom and its partners took legal action against counterfeit arcade units in regions such as Southeast Asia, North America, South Korea, and Puerto Rico.

====Home conversions====
The numerous home conversions of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; are listed among Capcom&#x27;s Platinum-class games, with more than one million units sold worldwide. In Japan, 1 million copies of the Super Famicom version were sold in June 1992 within the first two weeks of its release, at a retail price of (equivalent to $ then, or $ in ). The February 1992 issue of &quot;Gamest&quot; in Japan said that, due to low stock, the console versions were selling for much higher at ¥15,000 (equivalent to about at the time, or $ in ). It topped the Japanese &quot;Famitsu&quot; sales charts from June through July to August 1992. It was a multi-million seller in Japan by December 1992.

In the United States, 750,000 units of the SNES version were sold between July 15 and September 30, 1992, with a retail price of . According to &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;: &quot;Never has a game taken the country [by] storm as this one has.&quot; It remained America&#x27;s top-selling Super NES game for much of late 1992, in August and then October, November, and December. In 1992 in North America, units were sold. In the United Kingdom, &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; replaced &quot;Super Mario World&quot; as the bundled game for the SNES, and the SNES and Amiga versions made it the second best-selling home video game of 1992, below &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; for the Mega Drive. Worldwide, four million &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; cartridges had been sold by September 1992, units by the end of 1992, and over by 1993. The SNES version became the company&#x27;s best-selling single consumer game software, at more than 6.3 million units, and it remains its best-selling game software on a single platform. By 1993, units of all home software versions had been sold, and units for Nintendo and Sega consoles by March 1994.

The SNES versions of &quot;Street Fighter II Turbo&quot; and &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot; had 4.1 million and two million unit sales, respectively, followed by the Mega Drive/Genesis version of &quot;Street Fighter II: Special Champion Edition&quot; with 1.65 million sales. In total, more than 14 million copies were sold for the SNES and Mega Drive/Genesis consoles. The SNES version of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; was Capcom&#x27;s best-selling single game until 2013, when it was surpassed by &quot;Resident Evil 5&quot;. The Amiga version was successful in the United Kingdom, where it became the best-selling home computer software of 1992, though only being available for the last 16 days of the year. &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; also topped the UK&#x27;s Amiga sales chart in January 1993, and the UK&#x27;s Atari ST chart in March 1993. In 2008, &quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix&quot; broke both the first-day and first-week sales records for a download-only game. &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; was the best-selling fighting game with 15.5million units sold across all versions and platforms, until it was surpassed by &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; in 2019.

Like the arcades, the home conversions were impacted by copyright infringement. Upon release of the SNES version in 1992, thirteen different unauthorized versions were reportedly available for the Super Famicom.

===Critical===
====Japan====
The original arcade version of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; was awarded Best Game of 1991 in &quot;Gamest&quot;″s Fifth Annual Grand Prize, which also won in the genre of Best Action Game (the award for fighting games was not established yet). &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; placed No. 1 in Best VGM, Best Direction, and Best Album, and was second place in Best Graphics below the 3D Namco System 21 game &quot;Starblade&quot;. All the characters except M. Bison (known internationally as Balrog) are on the list of Best Characters of 1991.

&quot;Street Fighter II Dash&quot; was awarded Best Game of 1992 in the Sixth Annual Grand Prize, as published in the February 1993 issue of &quot;Gamest&quot;, winning again as Best Action Game. It placed No. 3 in Best VGM, No. 6 in Best Graphics, and No. 5 in Best Direction. The &quot;Street Fighter II Image Album&quot; is the No. 1 Best Album in the same issue, with the Drama CD version of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; tied for No. 7 with the soundtrack for &quot;Star Blade&quot;. The List of Best Characters only had Chun-Li at No. 3.

In the February 1994 issue of &quot;Gamest&quot;, both &quot;Street Fighter II Turbo&quot; and &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot; were nominated for Best Game of 1993, but neither won (the first place was given to &quot;Samurai Spirits&quot;). &quot;Super&quot; ranked third place, and &quot;Turbo&quot; ranked sixth. In the category of Best Fighting Games, &quot;Super&quot; ranked third place again, while &quot;Turbo&quot; placed fifth. &quot;Super&quot; won third place in the categories of Best Graphics and Best VGM. Cammy, who was introduced in &quot;Super&quot;, placed fifth place in the list of Best Characters of 1993, with Dee Jay at 36 and T. Hawk at 37. In the January 30, 1995 issue of &quot;Gamest&quot;, &quot;Super Street Fighter II X&quot; (known as &quot;Super Turbo&quot; internationally) placed fourth place in the award for Best Game of 1994 and Best Fighting Game, but did not rank in any of the other awards.

The Super Famicom (SNES) version was critically acclaimed. &quot;Famitsu&quot;″s panel of four reviewers gave it scores of 9, 9, 9, and 8, adding up to 35 out of 40. This made it one of their five highest-rated games of 1992, along with &quot;Dragon Quest V: Hand of the Heavenly Bride&quot;, &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot;, &quot;World of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck&quot;, and &quot;Mario Paint&quot;. They later gave the &quot;Turbo&quot; update a score of 36 out of 40. This made &quot;Street Fighter II Turbo&quot; their highest-rated game of 1993, and the twelfth game to have received a &quot;Famitsu&quot; score of 36/40 or above. 

====International====
The arcade game was well received by English-language critics upon release. In March 1991, &quot;RePlay&quot; said that &quot;the graphics and sounds are tops&quot; while praising the &quot;solid&quot; gameplay, and it was considered the top game at the American Coin Machine Exposition (ACME) that month. In May 1991, Julian Rignall of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; gave it ratings of 94% for graphics, 93% for sound, 95% for playability, and 92% for lastability, with a 93% score overall. He criticized the original &quot;Street Fighter&quot; for being a &quot;run-of-the-mill beat &#x27;em up with little in the way of thrills and spills&quot; but praised the sequel for being &quot;absolutely packed with new ideas&quot; and special moves. He noted the &quot;six buttons combining with 8 joystick directions to provide more moves than I&#x27;ve ever seen in a beat &#x27;em up&quot; and praised the &quot;massive, beautifully drawn and animated sprites, tons of speech and the most exciting, action-packed head-to-head conflict yet seen in an arcade game,&quot; concluding that it is &quot;one of the best fighting games yet seen in the arcades&quot; and a &quot;brilliant&quot; coin-op. In the June 1991 issue of &quot;Sinclair User&quot;, John Cook gave the arcade game an &quot;addict factor&quot; of 84%. He praised the gameplay and the &quot;excellent&quot; animation and sound effects, but criticized the controls, stating players &quot;might find the control system a bit daunting at first [with] a joystick plus six (count &#x27;em!) fire buttons [but] it&#x27;s not that bad really&quot;. He concluded &quot;this is bound to appeal to you if you like the beat &#x27;em up style of game.&quot; Jeff Davy of &quot;Your Commodore&quot; praised the game for its large sprites, character animation, varied opponents, character moves, and two-player mode. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; later referred to &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; as the &quot;game of the millennium&quot; in 1992.

The SNES version of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; was very well received. In &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; (&quot;EGM&quot;), its panel of four reviewers gave it scores of 10, 9, 10, and 9, adding up to 38 out of 40, and their &quot;Game of the Month&quot; award. Sushi-X (Ken Williams) gave it a 10, calling it &quot;The best! &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; is the only game I have ever seen that really deserves a 10!&quot; Martin Alessi gave it a 9, describing it as &quot;the best cart available anywhere! Incredible game play!&quot; Ed Semrad gave it a 10, saying &quot;The moves are perfect, the graphics outstanding and the audio exceptional. Get one of the new 6 button sticks and you&#x27;ll swear you&#x27;re playing the arcade version.&quot; &quot;GamePro&quot; printed two reviews of the game in its August 1992 issue, both giving it a full score of 5 out of 5; Doctor Dave described it as &quot;Capcom&#x27;s best arcade conversion yet&quot; while Slasher Quan stated that almost &quot;everything&#x27;s perfect in the Super NES version&quot; and that it is &quot;a nearly flawless conversion of the arcade original that&#x27;s made even more enjoyable by new options and the convenience of home fighting.&quot; &quot;Super Play&quot; gave it a 94% score, stating that with &quot;the inclusion of &quot;Champion Edition&quot;″s Character vs. Character select and the extra options, I would even go so far to say that this is actually better than the coin-op.&quot; &quot;Electronic Games&quot; gave it scores of 95% for graphics, 92% for sound, and 93% for playability, with a 94% overall, concluding that it is the best fighting game to date. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; scored it 16.2 out of 20, stating that the &quot;hottest arcade game around has been faithfully reproduced for this Super NES conversion&quot; and that it &quot;is just like having the arcade game at home!&quot;. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; ranked it the best SNES game of 1992, above &quot;The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past&quot; in second place.

&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in April 1994 said that &quot;&quot;Street Fighter II&quot; now enters the PC ring rather late and with a touch of weak wrist&quot;. The magazine reported that &quot;the atmosphere and the impact of hefty welts and bone-crushing action is just not here. The usual lament of many PC gamers about arcade conversions is once again true: too little and too late&quot;.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote: &quot;Sure, it&#x27;s violent (people can be set on fire), but &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; offers a depth of play (each character has more than 20 different moves) unmatched by any other video-game slugfest.&quot;

&quot;Street Fighter II&quot; was named by &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; as the Game of the Year for 1992. &quot;EGM&quot; awarded &quot;Street Fighter II Turbo&quot; with Best Super NES Game in 1993. &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; won the Golden Joystick Award for Game of the Year in 1992. &quot;Game Informer&quot; gave it the &quot;Best Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Best Playability in a Video Game&quot; awards. It won &quot;Electronic Games&quot;″s Electronic Gaming Award for the Video Game of the Year, where it was nominated along with &quot;NHLPA Hockey &#x27;93&quot; and &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot;.

The Mega Drive version of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; received ten out of ten for both graphics and addiction from &quot;Mega&quot;, who described it as &quot;a candidate for best game ever and without a doubt the best beat-&#x27;em-up of all time&quot; and gave it an overall 92% score. &quot;MegaTech&quot; scored it 95% and awarded it Hyper Game, stating &quot;the greatest coin-op hits the Megadrive in perfect form&quot;. &quot;Edge&quot; gave the PC Engine version of &quot;Champion Edition&quot; a score of eight out of ten. The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;, while remarking that the Game Boy control is difficult, the game speed &quot;lethargically slow&quot;, and it is a very old game, agreed it to be an excellent conversion by Game Boy standards. The Axe Grinder of &quot;GamePro&quot; agreed, praising the graphics and Game Boy survival mode, but criticizing the slow controls and concluding that &quot;The real problem here is that the game&#x27;s just plain old.&quot;

====Retrospective====
&quot;Street Fighter II&quot; has been listed among the best games of all time. &quot;Game Informer&quot; ranked it as the 22nd-best game ever made in 2001. The staff praised it for popularizing the one-on-one fighting game genre and noted that its Super NES ports were &quot;near-perfect.&quot; They later ranked it the 25th-best game ever made in 2009. Other publications that listed it among the best games of all time include &quot;BuzzFeed&quot;, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;, &quot;IGN&quot;, &quot;Edge&quot;, &quot;Empire&quot;, &quot;Famitsu&quot;, &quot;FHM&quot;, G4, GameFAQs, &quot;GameSpot&quot;, &quot;GamingBolt&quot;, &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, &quot;Next Generation&quot;, &quot;NowGamer&quot;, &quot;Retro Gamer&quot;, &quot;Stuff&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, and Yahoo! &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; awarded &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; the world records of &quot;First Fighting Game to Use Combos&quot;, &quot;Most Cloned Fighting Game&quot;, and &quot;Biggest-Selling Coin-Operated Fighting Game&quot; in the &quot;Guinness World Records: Gamer&#x27;s Edition 2008&quot;. In 2017, The Strong National Museum of Play inducted &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; to its World Video Game Hall of Fame.

&quot;GameSpot&quot; gave the PlayStation 3 version of &quot;HD Remix&quot; a score of 8.5 out of 10.

&quot;PC Gamer&quot; listed the 1993 DOS version of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; as one of the worst PC ports of all time.

==Legacy==
===Sequels===
The &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; games were followed by several sub-series of &quot;Street Fighter&quot; games and spinoffs, including &quot;Street Fighter EX&quot;, &quot;Pocket Fighter&quot;, &quot;Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo&quot;, and &quot;Vs.&quot; series. A prequel to &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot;, was released in 1995. The direct sequel to &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, &quot;Street Fighter III&quot;, would be released in 1997. Capcom released &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot; for the arcades in July 2008, followed by Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in February 2009 and Microsoft Windows in July 2009. &quot;Street Fighter V&quot; was released for the PlayStation 4 and Windows in 2016. &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot; was released for the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows and Xbox Series X/S in June 2023, an arcade version was released in Japan in December 2023.

===Other media===
* The characters joined the &quot;G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero&quot; lineup in 1993, as Hasbro bought their toy rights.
* An unofficial South Korean animation, &quot;Street Fighter&quot;, was produced by Daiwon Animation in 1992 and features the cast of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;. The Hong Kong movie &quot;Future Cops&quot; has a renamed cast of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; characters.
* Two film adaptations were released in 1994: &quot;Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie&quot;, a Japanese anime film produced by Group TAC; and &quot;Street Fighter&quot;, an American live-action film starring Jean-Claude Van Damme.
* A U.S. &quot;Street Fighter&quot; cartoon follows a combined plot of the live-action movie and the game series. An unrelated anime, &quot;Street Fighter II V&quot;, features younger characters similar to &quot;The Legend of Chun-Li&quot;.
* Capcom sponsored IndyCar driver Kenji Momota at the 1992 Indianapolis 500, providing a &quot;Street Fighter&quot; livery for his No. 88 car, which failed to qualify.

===Impact===
&quot;Street Fighter II&quot; is regarded as one of the most influential video games of all time, and the most important fighting game in particular. The release of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; in 1991 is often considered a revolutionary moment in the fighting game genre. It has the most accurate joystick and button scanning routine in the genre, allowing players to reliably execute multi-button special moves, and its graphics use Capcom&#x27;s CPS arcade chipset, with highly detailed characters and stages. Whereas previous games allow players to combat a variety of computer-controlled fighters, &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; allows human combat.

The popularity of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; surprised the gaming industry, as arcade owners bought more machines to keep up with demand. It was responsible for introducing the combo mechanic, which came about when skilled players learned that they could combine several attacks with no time for the opponent to recover. Its success inspired a wave of other fighting games, which were initially often labeled as &quot;clones&quot; or imitators, including titles such as &quot;Guardians of the &#x27;Hood&quot;, &quot;Art of Fighting&quot;, &quot;Time Killers&quot;, &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, and &quot;Killer Instinct&quot;. &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; also influenced the development of the combat mechanics of beat &#x27;em up game &quot;Streets of Rage 2&quot;. However, &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; also received criticism for its depiction of street violence, and for having inspired numerous other violent games in the industry.

&quot;Street Fighter II&quot; was the best-selling arcade video game by far since the golden age of arcade video games, bringing an arcade renaissance in the early 1990s. Its impact on home video games was equally important, becoming a long-lasting system-seller for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Since then up until the late 1990s, numerous best-selling home video games were arcade ports. In 2005, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; ranked it the ninth most important game since they began publication in 1989, stating no game &quot;did more to prop up arcades&quot; in the 1990s and it was the first killer app for the SNES.

The game popularized the concept of &quot;face-to-face&quot;, tournament-level competition between two players instead of just high scores. This enabled the competitive multiplayer and deathmatch modes found in modern action games. John Romero, for example, cited the competitive multiplayer of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; as an influence on the deathmatch mode of seminal first-person shooter &quot;Doom&quot;.

It is an innovation in revision series, with Capcom continuously upgrading and expanding the arcade game instead of releasing a sequel. This furthered the practice of patches and downloadable content found in modern video games.

===Popular culture===
&quot;Street Fighter II&quot; has been frequently sampled and referenced in hip hop music, by artists such as The Lady of Rage, Nicki Minaj, Lupe Fiasco, Dizzee Rascal, Lil B, Sean Price, and Madlib. This started with Hi-C&#x27;s &quot;Swing&#x27;n&quot; (1993) and DJ Qbert&#x27;s &quot;Track 10&quot; (1994) which sampled &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, and the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; film soundtrack (1994) which is the first major film soundtrack to consist almost entirely of hip hop music. According to DJ Qbert, &quot;I think hip-hop is a cool thing, I think &quot;Street Fighter&quot; is a cool thing&quot;. According to &quot;Vice&quot; magazine, &quot;&quot;Street Fighter&quot;″s mixture of competition, bravado, and individualism easily translate into the trials and travails of a rapper.&quot; The &quot;Perfect&quot; sample was used by Kanye West and Drake in &quot;The Life of Pablo&quot; (2016). UK rap includes grime DJ Logan Sama saying, &quot;&quot;Street Fighter&quot; is just a huge cultural thing that everyone experienced growing up [with] such a huge impact that it has just stayed in everyone&#x27;s consciousness.&quot; According to Jake Hawkes of Soapbox, &quot;grime was built around lyrical clashes [and] the 1v1 setup of these clashes was easily equated with &quot;Street Fighter&quot;″s 1 on 1 battles.&quot; Grime MCs such as Dizzee Rascal were sampling &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; in 2002, and &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; has been sampled &quot;by almost every grime MC&quot;. It became an integral part of BBC Radio 1Xtra DJ Charlie Sloth&#x27;s &quot;Fire in the Booth&quot; freestyle segments, using samples such as &quot;Hadouken&quot;, &quot;Shoryuken&quot;, and the &quot;Perfect&quot; announcer sound.

<text>Michigan is a state located in the Midwest region of the United States. According to the 2020 United States Census, Michigan is the 10th most populous state with inhabitants and the 22nd largest by land area spanning of land. Michigan is divided into 83 counties and contains 1,773 municipalities consisting of 276 cities, 257 villages, and 1,240 townships. The largest municipality by population in Michigan is Detroit with 639,111 residents; the smallest municipality by population is Pointe Aux Barques Township with 15 residents. The largest municipality by land area is McMillan Township which spans , while Ahmeek is the smallest at .

Municipalities include incorporated cities and villages, and townships (often referred to collectively as &quot;CVTs&quot;), which may either be general law or chartered. Charter townships are unique to Michigan among U.S. states, are delegated more power over local taxation, but have more municipal responsibilities and obligations. Cities are not subject to a township&#x27;s jurisdiction, but villages remain part of the township in which they are located; village residents pay both township and village taxes, and share services with the township. Since all Michigan residents who do not live in a city live in a township, a village&#x27;s population is counted in the population of the township in which it is located.

<text>Hit of the Week was an American record label founded in 1930 that sold low-priced records made of Durium instead of the usual shellac.

==History==
Around 1930, several types of thin, flexible records made of various plastic formulations were introduced in Europe, such as the German Phonycord, French Pathé Cellodisc, British Filmophone and Goodson, and Spanish Delfos records. In the US, this short-lived trend was represented by Hit of the Week records, which were made of a sturdy brown paper base coated with Durium, a lightweight synthetic resin. The records tended to have a low-frequency rumble due to their texture, and their audio fidelity was generally inferior than most ordinary shellac records of the time. Unusually, Hit of the Week records were recorded on one side only, an early practice in the disc record industry which most other manufacturers had generally abandoned around 1910. As a consequence of being uncoated on the other side, they have a strong tendency to curl and now often require the use of a clip or weight around the turntable spindle to keep them sufficiently flat during play. A few releases had the performer&#x27;s portrait printed on the uncoated paper side, or were imprinted there with advertising matter. They were issued in flimsy rice paper sleeves, few of which have survived.

A new issue featuring a current &quot;hit&quot; popular song was released every week. Unlike other records, they were sold at newsstands. Previous issues could be obtained by mail order. Retailing for 15 cents each, later raised to 20 cents, Hit of the Week records were by far the lowest-priced records in the US at that time.

The first regular issue was released in February 1930. By the summer of 1930, up to half a million copies of each week&#x27;s issue were produced. But as the Depression worsened, sales slumped. In March 1931 the company went into receivership and in May it was purchased by the Erwin, Wasey &amp; Company advertising agency. A new format debuted in August, featuring two songs or dance tunes on each single-sided disc and a total playing time of about five minutes, but the label remained unprofitable. The final Hit of the Week issue was released in June 1932.

After the demise of the label, some limited use was made of smaller (often only four inches in diameter) records made of the same material, mostly for giveaway advertising novelties. Specimens of one of the most common advertising records, which invited the recipient to come see the new 1932 Chevrolet automobile, are usually found with a mailing label and postage on the uncoated back side.

Musicians who recorded for Hit of the Week included Gene Austin, Duke Ellington and His Orchestra (under the pseudonym &quot;Harlem Hot Chocolates&quot;), Ben Pollack, Eddie Cantor (on a special 25 cent &quot;Durium De Luxe&quot; issue), Morton Downey, and Rudy Vallée. Most of the arrangements were performed by studio musicians in New York, led by Adrian Schubert, Bert Hirsch, Vincent Lopez, Don Voorhees, and Phil Spitalny. Jazz &quot;breaks&quot; by instrumental stars such as Joe Venuti and Eddie Lang enlivened some recordings. The vocalists who recorded with the studio bands included several popular radio singers of the period, such as Ralph Kirbery and Helen Rowland.

In the UK, a similar series was issued on the Durium label.

<doc id="236041" wikidata="Q2606" url="?curid=236041" title="Unary coding">
<text>Unary coding, or the unary numeral system and also sometimes called thermometer code, is an entropy encoding that represents a natural number, &quot;n&quot;, with a code of length &quot;n&quot; + 1 ( or &quot;n&quot; ), usually &quot;n&quot; ones followed by a zero (if &quot;natural number&quot; is understood as &quot;non-negative integer&quot;) or with &quot;n&quot; − 1 ones followed by a zero (if &quot;natural number&quot; is understood as &quot;strictly positive integer&quot;). For example 5 is represented as 111110 or 11110. Some representations use &quot;n&quot; or &quot;n&quot; − 1 zeros followed by a one. The ones and zeros are interchangeable without loss of generality. Unary coding is both a prefix-free code and a self-synchronizing code.
Unary coding is an optimally efficient encoding for the following discrete probability distribution

:formula_1

for formula_2.

In symbol-by-symbol coding, it is optimal for any geometric distribution

:formula_3

for which &quot;k&quot; ≥ φ = 1.61803398879..., the golden ratio, or, more generally, for any discrete distribution for which

:formula_4

for formula_2. Although it is the optimal symbol-by-symbol coding for such probability distributions, Golomb coding achieves better compression capability for the geometric distribution because it does not consider input symbols independently, but rather implicitly groups the inputs. For the same reason, arithmetic encoding performs better for general probability distributions, as in the last case above.

==Unary code in use today==
Examples of unary code uses include:
* In Golomb Rice code, unary encoding is used to encode the quotient part of the Golomb code word.
* In UTF-8, unary encoding is used in the leading byte of a multi-byte sequence to indicate the number of bytes in the sequence so that the length of the sequence can be determined without examining the continuation bytes.
* Instantaneously trained neural networks use unary coding for efficient data representation.

==Unary coding in biological networks==
Unary coding is used in the neural circuits responsible for birdsong production. The nucleus in the brain of the songbirds that plays a part in both the learning and the production of bird song is the HVC (high vocal center). The command signals for different notes in the birdsong emanate from different points in the HVC. This coding works as space coding which is an efficient strategy for biological circuits due to its inherent simplicity and robustness.

==Standard run-length unary codes==
All binary data is defined by the ability to represent unary numbers in alternating run-lengths of 1s and 0s. This conforms to the standard definition of unary i.e. N digits of the same number 1 or 0. All run-lengths by definition have at least one digit and thus represent &quot;strictly positive integers&quot;.

These codes are guaranteed to end validly on any length of data ( when reading arbitrary data ) and in the ( separate ) write cycle allow for the use and transmission of an extra bit ( the one used for the first bit ) while maintaining overall and per-integer unary code lengths of exactly N.

==Uniquely decodable non-prefix unary codes==
Following is an example of uniquely decodable unary codes that is not a prefix code and is not instantaneously decodable (need look-ahead to decode)

These codes also ( when writing unsigned integers ) allow for the use and transmission of an extra bit ( the one used for the first bit ). Thus they are able to transmit &#x27;m&#x27; integers * N unary bits and 1 additional bit of information within m*N bits of data.

==Symmetric unary codes==
Following set of unary codes are symmetric and can be read in any direction. It is also instantaneously decodable in either direction. 
==Canonical unary codes==
For unary values where the maximum is known, one can use canonical unary codes that are of a somewhat numerical nature and different from character based codes. It involves starting with numerical &#x27;0&#x27; or &#x27;-1&#x27; ( formula_6) and the maximum number of digits then for each step reducing the number of digits by one and increasing/decreasing the result by numerical &#x27;1&#x27;. 

Canonical codes can require less processing time to decode when they are processed as numbers not a string. If the number of codes required per symbol length is different to 1, i.e. there are more non-unary codes of some length required, those would be achieved by increasing/decreasing the values numerically without reducing the length in that case.

==Generalized unary coding==
A generalized version of unary coding was presented by Subhash Kak to represent numbers much more efficiently than standard unary coding. Here&#x27;s an example of generalized unary coding for integers from 0 through 15 that requires only 7 bits (where three bits are arbitrarily chosen in place of a single one in standard unary to show the number). Note that the representation is cyclic where one uses markers to represent higher integers in higher cycles.

Generalized unary coding requires that the range of numbers to be represented to be pre-specified because this range determines the number of bits that are needed.

<doc id="236048" wikidata="Q2608" url="?curid=236048" title="Truncated binary encoding">
<text>Truncated binary encoding is an entropy encoding typically used for uniform probability distributions with a finite alphabet. It is parameterized by an alphabet with total size of number &quot;n&quot;. It is a slightly more general form of binary encoding when &quot;n&quot; is not a power of two.

If &quot;n&quot; is a power of two, then the coded value for 0 ≤ &quot;x&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot; is the simple binary code for &quot;x&quot; of length log2(&quot;n&quot;).
Otherwise let &quot;k&quot; = floor(log2(&quot;n&quot;)), such that 2&quot;k&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot; &lt; 2&quot;k&quot;+1
and let &quot;u&quot; = 2&quot;k&quot;+1 − &quot;n&quot;.

Truncated binary encoding assigns the first &quot;u&quot; symbols codewords of length &quot;k&quot; and then assigns the remaining &quot;n&quot; − &quot;u&quot; symbols the last &quot;n&quot; − &quot;u&quot; codewords of length &quot;k&quot; + 1. Because all the codewords of length &quot;k&quot; + 1 consist of an unassigned codeword of length &quot;k&quot; with a &quot;0&quot; or &quot;1&quot; appended, the resulting code is a prefix code.

== History ==

Used since at least 1984, phase-in codes, also known as economy codes,
are also known as truncated binary encoding.

For example, for the alphabet {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, &quot;n&quot; = 5 and 22 ≤ &quot;n&quot; &lt; 23, hence &quot;k&quot; = 2 and &quot;u&quot; = 23 − 5 = 3. Truncated binary encoding assigns the first &quot;u&quot; symbols the codewords 00, 01, and 10, all of length 2, then assigns the last &quot;n&quot; − &quot;u&quot; symbols the codewords 110 and 111, the last two codewords of length 3.

For example, if &quot;n&quot; is 5, plain binary encoding and truncated binary encoding allocates the following codewords. Digits shown &lt;del&gt;struck&lt;/del&gt; are not transmitted in truncated binary.
It takes 3 bits to encode &quot;n&quot; using straightforward binary encoding, hence 23 − &quot;n&quot; = 8 − 5 = 3 are unused.

In numerical terms, to send a value &quot;x&quot;, where 0 ≤ &quot;x&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot;, and where there are 2&quot;k&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot; &lt; 2&quot;k&quot;+1 symbols, there are &quot;u&quot; = 2&quot;k&quot;+1 − &quot;n&quot; unused entries when the alphabet size is rounded up to the nearest power of two. The process to encode the number &quot;x&quot; in truncated binary is: if &quot;x&quot; is less than &quot;u&quot;, encode it in &quot;k&quot; binary bits; if &quot;x&quot; is greater than or equal to &quot;u&quot;, encode the value &quot;x&quot; + &quot;u&quot; in &quot;k&quot; + 1 binary bits.

==Example with &quot;n&quot; = 10==
Another example, encoding an alphabet of size 10 (between 0 and 9) requires 4 bits, but there are 24 − 10 = 6 unused codes, so input values less than 6 have the first bit discarded, while input values greater than or equal to 6 are offset by 6 to the end of the binary space. (Unused patterns are not shown in this table.)

To decode, read the first &quot;k&quot; bits. If they encode a value less than &quot;u&quot;, decoding is complete. Otherwise, read an additional bit and subtract &quot;u&quot; from the result.

==Example with &quot;n&quot; = 7==
Here is a more extreme case: with &quot;n&quot; = 7 the next power of 2 is 8, so &quot;k&quot; = 2 and &quot;u&quot; = 23 − 7 = 1:
This last example demonstrates that a leading zero bit does not always indicate a short code; if &quot;u&quot; &lt; 2&quot;k&quot;, some long codes will begin with a zero bit.

== Simple algorithm ==

Generate the truncated binary encoding for a value &quot;x&quot;, 0 ≤ &quot;x&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; &gt; 0 is the size of the alphabet containing &quot;x&quot;. &quot;n&quot; need not be a power of two. 

string TruncatedBinary (int x, int n)
 // Set k = floor(log2(n)), i.e., k such that 2^k &lt;= n &lt; 2^(k+1).
 int k = 0, t = n;
 while (t &gt; 1) { k++; t »= 1; }

 // Set u to the number of unused codewords = 2^(k+1) - n.
 int u = (1 « k + 1) - n;

 if (x &lt; u)
 return Binary(x, k); 
 else
 return Binary(x + u, k + 1));

The routine codice_1 is expository; usually just the rightmost codice_2 bits of the variable &quot;x&quot; are desired.
Here we simply output the binary code for &quot;x&quot; using codice_2 bits, padding with high-order 0s if necessary.

string Binary (int x, int len)
 string s = &quot;&quot;;
 while (x != 0) {
 if (even(x))
 s = &#x27;0&#x27; + s;
 else s = &#x27;1&#x27; + s;
 x »= 1;
 while (s.Length &lt; len)
 s = &#x27;0&#x27; + s;
 return s;


== On efficiency ==
If &quot;n&quot; is not a power of two, and &quot;k&quot;-bit symbols are observed with probability &quot;p&quot;, then (&quot;k&quot; + 1)-bit symbols are observed with probability 1 − &quot;p&quot;. We can calculate the expected number of bits per symbol formula_1 as

: formula_2

Raw encoding of the symbol has formula_3 bits. Then relative space saving &quot;s&quot; (see Data compression ratio) of the encoding can be defined as

: formula_4

When simplified, this expression leads to

: formula_5

This indicates that relative efficiency of truncated binary encoding increases as probability &quot;p&quot; of &quot;k&quot;-bit symbols increases, and the raw-encoding symbol bit-length formula_6 decreases.

<doc id="236056" wikidata="Q2719617" url="?curid=236056" title="Rudimentary Peni">
<text>Rudimentary Peni are a British anarcho-punk band formed in 1980, emerging from the London anarcho-punk scene. Lead singer/guitarist Nick Blinko is notorious for his witty, macabre lyrics and dark pen-and-ink artwork, prominently featured on all of Rudimentary Peni&#x27;s albums. Bassist Grant Matthews has also written several songs for the band, though his lyrics primarily focus on sociopolitical themes. Very few photos exist of the band, as their albums feature Blinko&#x27;s drawings instead, but Pushead published a few in an early edition of his magazine.

== History ==
Rudimentary Peni were formed in June 1980 in Abbots Langley, Hertfordshire, by Blinko (vocals, guitar), Greville (drums) and Matthews (bass).

Blinko and Greville had met years prior in Langleybury Comprehensive secondary school. Greville had been playing drums since he was young, beginning lessons at the age of 10, and slowly became interested in punk rock around the time &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks, Here&#x27;s the Sex Pistols&quot; by the Sex Pistols was released After meeting Blinko through a mutual friend, the pair began the experimental electronic duo the Magits, formed in 1977 and dissolved around 1980. The Magits released their first and only EP, &quot;Fully Coherent&quot;, in 1979 as the first record on Blinko&#x27;s newly formed Outer Himalayan Records. In his 2006 book &quot;The Day the Country Died: A History of Anarcho Punk 1980–1984&quot;, punk historian Ian Glasper referred to the sound of the Magits&#x27; EP as a &quot;meandering collection of keyboard torture&quot;.

Blinko, Greville, and Matthews subsequently formed Rudimentary Peni. In &quot;Maximum RocknRoll&quot; issue No. 237 (February 2003), Matthews explained how he came up with the name of the band: &quot;When I was at school studying biology, we were told that in the fetal stage the clitoris is a rudimentary penis&quot;. By 1981, the band had played their first show, along with the S-Haters and Soft Drinks in Watford, Hertfortshire. Greville later characterized the first show, as well as the ones following it, as fairly disappointing, setting a precedent for the band&#x27;s distaste for playing live. While they were inspired by punk rock, the band did not adopt the look of the day, as Greville noted: &quot;The majority of people [were] clearly disappointed that we didn&#x27;t have green mohicans and multiple piercings... if you were the sort of person to be put off by what we looked like, you were never going to understand or appreciate the songs anyway&quot;.

They recorded their first EP, an eponymous 12-song 7-inch, in 1981 at Street Level Studios in London and released it on Outer Himalayan. It was fast, loud, and often described as &quot;demented&quot; due to the sound, as well as Blinko&#x27;s lyrics and artwork, which adorned the cover and inner sleeves. After the release of the EP, the band played their first London show on 18 September 1981 along with anarcho-punk bands Flux of Pink Indians and the Subhumans.

Early on, Rudimentary Peni had connections with fellow anarcho-punks Crass, and their second 7-inch EP, &quot;Farce&quot;, was issued by Crass Records. Up through the band&#x27;s first studio album, &quot;Death Church&quot; (1983), their records were packaged in fold-out paper sleeves full of artwork, lyrics and poster graphics characteristic of Crass and many other bands in the anarcho-punk scene.

In 1987, the band&#x27;s first two EPs were collected by Corpus Christi Records as &quot;The EPs of RP&quot;.

Rudimentary Peni stopped performing in the mid-1980s after bassist Matthews was diagnosed with cancer. After a four-year hiatus, they recorded &quot;Cacophony&quot; (1988), a sonic tribute to seminal New England horror author H. P. Lovecraft. Mark Ferelli, a fellow musician, introduced Blinko to Lovecraft; the pair also pushed each other&#x27;s pen-and-ink artwork forward via friendly competition.

The band continued to record and release material into the 21st century, including the album &quot;Pope Adrian 37th Psychristiatric&quot; (1995) and the EPs &quot;Echoes of Anguish&quot; (1998), &quot;The Underclass&quot; (2000), &quot;Archaic&quot; (2004) and &quot;No More Pain&quot; (2008), and have maintained a diverse cult following in the United States punk scene. Most reissues of their 1980s albums are now out of print.

Blinko authored a semi-autobiographical novel called &quot;The Primal Screamer&quot;, published in 1995 by Spare Change Books (his bandmates and Ferelli appear under false names), as well as the more recent &quot;The Haunted Head&quot; (2009, Coptic Cat) and &quot;Visions of Pope Adrian 37th&quot; (2011, Coptic Cat). Blinko has also become increasingly popular in the outsider art scene.

== Musical style and influence ==
In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2016, the band was citied along with a number of other British anarcho-punk bands of the early 80s as being an influence to the American avant-garde metal group Neurosis.

A 2018 article in the US magazine &quot;Revolver&quot; stated that the band merges &quot;eighties anarcho-punk into seething death rock via the nightmarish poetry of certifiably schizoid frontman Nick Blinko&quot;.
