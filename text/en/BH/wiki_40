<text>New York State Route 17 (NY 17) is a major state highway that extends for through the Southern Tier and Downstate regions of New York in the United States. It begins at the Pennsylvania state line in Mina and runs east as a limited-access highway, following the Southern Tier Expressway to Binghamton and the Quickway from Binghamton east to Woodbury. At Woodbury, the route turns south to become a local arterial, eventually following the Orange Turnpike to the New Jersey state line near Suffern. The portion of NY 17 west of Woodbury is in the process of being upgraded to Interstate 86, and as of February 2025, the routes are concurrent from the Pennsylvania border to Vestal and from Kirkwood to Windsor.

At , NY 17 is the longest state route in New York, and is the second-longest highway of any kind in the state, behind only the New York State Thruway. It serves 11 counties, passes through the cities of Salamanca, Olean, Corning, Elmira, and Binghamton, and enters the vicinity of several others, including Jamestown and Middletown. As it proceeds across the state, it intersects many of New York&#x27;s major Interstate and U.S. Highways, including U.S. Route 219 (US 219) in Salamanca, I-390 in Avoca, I-99 and US 15 near Corning, I-81 and US 11 in Binghamton, I-84 and US 6 near Middletown, and I-87 in Woodbury. Aside from a brief concurrency with the Thruway near Hillburn, the route is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation, including a portion in the vicinity of Waverly that is physically located in Pennsylvania.

Initially part of an auto trail called the Liberty Highway, the route was added to the state highway system in 1924, extending from Westfield to Suffern via at-grade highways. As traffic demand surged, it was moved onto the Quickway and the Southern Tier Expressway as limited-access sections of both were completed from the 1950s to the 1990s. In 1998, all of NY 17 between the Pennsylvania state line and Woodbury was designated as &quot;Future I-86&quot;. The westernmost of the route was designated as I-86 one year later, and the designation has been gradually extended eastward as sections of NY 17 were improved to Interstate Highway standards. Prior to the I-86 designation, NY 17 was part of a multi-state Route 17 along with New Jersey Route 17 and the former Pennsylvania Route 17.

==Route description==
===Pennsylvania to Elmira===
NY 17 begins as a freeway at the point where I-86 crosses the New York–Pennsylvania border in Mina, Chautauqua County. I-86 heads westward from there to its western terminus at I-90. I-86 and NY 17 continue eastward through the Southern Tier, encountering NY 426 (exit 4) a short distance from the state line prior to meeting NY 76 (exit 6) south of Sherman. East of exit 8 (NY 394), I-86 and NY 17 cross Chautauqua Lake and follow the lake shore eastward to Jamestown, where it connects to NY 60 at exit 12 due north of the city. East of the city, the freeway meets US 62 at exit 14 and is joined by the old Erie Railroad line, which parallels the freeway as it heads across southern New York.

Between exits 17 and 18 (NY 280), I-86 and NY 17 cross the Allegheny Reservoir near its northernmost extent. Past NY 280, the freeway runs adjacent to the northern extent of the Allegany State Park and follows the reservoir and the connecting Allegheny River eastward to Salamanca. Near downtown Salamanca, I-86 and NY 17 meet US 219 (exit 21). US 219 joins the freeway east to exit 23 near Carrollton, where it splits from I-86 and NY 17 and heads toward Bradford, Pennsylvania, forming the eastern edge of the state park as it heads south. Meanwhile, the freeway continues east to Olean, where it meets NY 417 (a previous alignment of NY 17) at exit 24 west of town and NY 16 (exit 27) north of the area.

Past Olean, the route drifts northward away from Pennsylvania toward Hornell, where I-86 and NY 17 intersect NY 36 (exit 34). To the east in Avoca, the Southern Tier Expressway meets I-390 at exit 36. I-86 and NY 17 southeast from the junction, passing through Bath on its way an interchange with I-99 and US 15 in Painted Post (exit 44). Here, I-99 and US 15 begin and head south toward Pennsylvania, while I-86 and NY 17 continue east through Corning to the city of Elmira.

===Elmira to Harriman===

From Elmira to Binghamton, NY 17, the Erie Railroad (now operated by Norfolk Southern as the Southern Tier Line), and its old alignments generally stay close together. They follow the Chemung River to exit 60 (US 220 in South Waverly, Pennsylvania) and the Susquehanna River from east of exit 61 (Waverly, New York) to Binghamton; on the latter section, both NY 17C and NY 434 are old NY 17. Between the two rivers, which intersect in Pennsylvania, the general corridor runs just north of the state line in New York. NY 17 itself crosses into Pennsylvania for approximately between a point west of exit 60 and a point west of exit 61; additionally, all the ramps at exit 60 and portions of the eastbound ramps at exits 59A and 61 are in Pennsylvania. Despite being in Pennsylvania, it is still signed as NY 17, and these roadways are still maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation. At the Tioga County line near Waverly, I-86 temporarily terminates as NY 17 continues eastward toward Binghamton.

Near downtown Binghamton, NY 17 goes around the side of Prospect Mountain at what is locally known as &quot;kamikaze curve&quot;. Heading eastbound, the freeway curves sharply left around the hillside, splits into ramps to I-81 north and south, and curves right to merge into I-81 south as it passes over the Chenango River. From that point east and southeast about , I-81 and NY 17 run concurrently. NY 17 splits from I-81, the Erie Railroad and the Susquehanna River to the east into Stilson Hollow; from this split (exit 75) to its end, most of NY 17 does not follow the Erie Railroad, which crosses into Pennsylvania several times.

At the end of Stilson Hollow, NY 17 heads over a summit and into the valley formed by the Occanum Creek. The creek empties into the Susquehanna River at Windsor (exit 79), which NY 17 follows southeast to Damascus (exit 80) before turning northeast along Tuscarora Creek. It soon turns east and southeast over a summit, rejoining the Erie Railroad just north of Gulf Summit. The highway and railroad head east along Oquaga Creek to Deposit (exit 84), where they turn southeast along the West Branch Delaware River, where NY 17 briefly becomes an arterial road. A gap in the freeway stretches from here to just short of Hancock (exit 87), the place the West Branch joins with the East Branch Delaware River. The Erie Railroad continues southeast along the combined Delaware River, while NY 17 turns east along the valley formed by the East Branch, either closely following or built directly over the abandoned New York, Ontario and Western Railway to Liberty.

At East Branch (exit 90), the East Branch Delaware River turns north, and NY 17 continues east with the Beaver Kill to Roscoe (exit 94), Willowemoc Creek to Livingston Manor (exit 96), and Little Beaver Kill to Parksville (exit 98). The highway and parallel NYO&amp;W pass south over a summit to Liberty (exits 99–100), and continue along the Middle Mongaup River to Ferndale (exit 101). The NYO&amp;W turned east there, but NY 17 continues south over a summit and into the Spring Brook and East Mongaup River valleys past Harris (exit 102). NY 17 then cuts southeast cross-country to Monticello (exit 104; passing Monticello Raceway) and beyond, following the old Newburgh and Cochecton Turnpike (old NY 17) to Bloomingburg (exit 116). The old Middletown and Wurtsboro Turnpike, also old NY 17, and partially NY 17M, runs south to Middletown, which NY 17 cuts cross-country to bypass to the east, rejoining NY 17M – and the main line of the Erie Railroad – at Goshen (exit 123). NY 17, its old former alignment (NY 17M) and the Erie run generally east-southeast, partly cross-country and partly through small stream valleys, to the end of the freeway, the directional change in NY 17 from east–west to north–south, and the junction of the Erie with its branch to Newburgh.

===Harriman to New Jersey===
NY 17 heads southwest from the Quickway as a surface road, passing through the village of Woodbury before entering the village of Harriman, where it intersects with the eastern terminus of NY 17M. As the route heads southward from this junction, its signage changes from being east or west to north or south. The route parallels the Thruway as it proceeds through a disjointed piece of Harriman State Park and enters the town of Tuxedo. While inside the park, NY 17 intersects Arden Valley Road, a parkway that connects to Seven Lakes Drive deep inside the park. South of Arden Valley Road, NY 17 briefly exits Harriman State Park and enters the hamlet of Southfields, where it intersects with County Route 19 (CR 19) and passes by the Red Apple Rest, a former restaurant and roadside attraction.
Past the hamlet, the route heads back into the park and intersects with NY 17A and CR 106 near the park&#x27;s western boundary. South of the junction, NY 17 leaves the park and proceeds through a lightly populated area to the village of Tuxedo Park. At the Tuxedo Park train station is access to some hiking trails in Harriman State Park. The route continues on, paralleling the Thruway into Rockland County. On the other side of the county line, NY 17 enters the village of Sloatsburg, where it meets Seven Lakes Drive and connects to CR 72 by way of a modified trumpet interchange.

Outside of Sloatsburg, NY 17 becomes a four-lane expressway and winds its way southeasterly along the Ramapo River and the Thruway through the town of Ramapo to the hamlet of the same name, based just north of NY 17&#x27;s junction with NY 59. Here, NY 17 turns to the southwest, merging onto the Thruway southbound at exit 15A, traversing a sparsely developed area of the village of Hillburn. About south of merging onto the Thruway, NY 17 passes to the south of the village center as it approaches I-287. At exit 15A for New Jersey, NY 17 leaves the Thruway and merges with I-287 southbound and proceeds to the New Jersey state line, where it connects to New Jersey&#x27;s Route 17. An old alignment of NY 17 in Hillburn, now called Old Route 17 used to go around the Thruway instead of merging onto it.

==History==

===Origins===

==== Before the automobile ====

From Binghamton to Corning, NY 17 follows the course of the Great Bend and Bath Turnpike, which was legislated in 1808 to continue the Cochecton and Great Bend Turnpike (US 11) through the Susquehanna Valley. The road ran from the Pennsylvania state line at Great Bend through Binghamton, Owego, and Elmira to Bath. In its day, it was a major route of travel through the Susquehanna Valley. Today, the road is designated US 11 from Pennsylvania to Binghamton, then NY 17C to Waverly, NY 352 into Corning, and NY 415 to Bath. The at-grade sections of NY 17 in Orange County follow the Orange Turnpike south of Southfields and the New Windsor and Cornwall Turnpike to its north.

==== Liberty Highway and Legislative Route 4 ====
The original routing of NY 17, from Westfield to Harriman, was largely designated in 1908 by the New York State Legislature as Route 4, an unsigned legislative route. This routing was incorporated in 1918 as the main portion of an auto trail called the Liberty Highway, which connected New York City to Cleveland via Hackensack, Liberty, the Southern Tier, and Erie.

Legislative Route 4 began at legislative Route 18 (current US 20) in Westfield and proceeded southeast through Mayville to Jamestown on what is now NY 394 and NY 430. From there, the route headed generally eastward to Salamanca over modern NY 394, NY 242, and NY 353, and southeast to Olean via NY 417. At Olean, the route shifted northward, passing through Hinsdale, Friendship, and Belvidere on current NY 16, NY 446 and Allegany County&#x27;s CR 20 before returning southward on what is now NY 19 to access the village of Wellsville.
From Wellsville to Andover and from Jasper to Corning, Route 4 followed modern NY 417. In between Andover and Jasper, however, Route 4 veered north on current NY 21 and NY 36 to serve Hornell. East of Corning, the alignment of legislative Route 4 ran along the Great Bend and Bath Turnpike, and more closely resembled the modern alignments of the Southern Tier Expressway and the Quickway. Route 4 exited Corning on what is now NY 352 and followed it to Big Flats, where it broke from NY 352 and proceeded to Horseheads on Chemung CR 64 and to Elmira on what is now Lake Road, Madison Avenue and the east end of NY 352. Between Elmira and Binghamton, Route 4 followed either local roads that were bypassed or upgraded into the Southern Tier Expressway, namely modern NY 17 and Chemung and Tioga CR 60 from Elmira to Waverly, NY 17C between Waverly and Owego, NY 434 from Owego to Vestal, and NY 17C and Riverside Drive (via NY 26) from Vestal to Binghamton.

Route 4 exited the city on US 11 and followed it to Kirkwood Center, a hamlet adjacent to the eastern junction of NY 17 and I-81. From this point to Harriman, except for one section near Middletown, the path Route 4 followed became the basis for the Quickway several decades later. Between Kirkwood Center and Hancock, Route 4 utilized what was later upgraded into the Quickway (via Broome CR 28 from Windsor to Deposit). East of here, it used parallel roads instead: modern &quot;Old Route 17&quot; (Delaware CR 17 and Sullivan CRs 179A to 174) from Deposit to Monticello, Sullivan CRs 173 to 171 between Monticello and Bloomingburg, and Orange CR 76 and NY 17M from Bloomingburg to Harriman. At Harriman, Route 4 broke from the Liberty Highway and proceeded northeast over current US 6 and NY 293 to Highland Falls, where it ended at legislative Route 3 (modern US 9W). The portion of the Liberty Highway between Suffern and Harriman became part of legislative Route 39-b in 1911; however, this designation was removed on March 1, 1921. Another auto trail, the West Shore Route, also followed this section of the Liberty Highway, but proceeded north from Harimman along modern-day NY 32.

===Designation and early changes===

When New York first signed its state highways with route numbers in 1924, much of legislative Route 4 was designated as NY 17. From Randolph to Salamanca, NY 17 followed the more southerly routing of the Liberty Highway instead of the Route 4 routing, bypassing Little Valley to the south in favor of a direct connection between Randolph and Salamanca (current NY 394 and NY 951T). In Vestal, NY 17 was routed along the south bank of the Susquehanna River, bypassing Endicott and Johnson City on what is now NY 434 and Broome CR 44. Lastly, NY 17 broke from the path of legislative Route 4 in Harriman and followed the former Route 39-b south to the New Jersey state line at Suffern. As originally laid out, NY 17 was long.

In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY 17 basically remained intact. The only changes made at this time were the straightening out of the Olean–Wellsville segment (now via Ceres) and the Andover–Jasper segment (now via Greenwood).

NY 17 initially reached New Jersey by way of Suffern&#x27;s Orange Avenue (now US 202) and connected to New Jersey&#x27;s Route 2 at the state line. In 1932, an alternate route of NY 17 between the New Jersey state line at Hillburn and the hamlet of Ramapo on the western bank of the Ramapo River was designated as NY 339. The route largely followed the path of modern I-287 and the New York State Thruway between the two locations. It initially became a local road upon crossing into New Jersey; however, Route 2 was realigned to connect to NY 339 instead of NY 17.

In the mid-1930s, the alignments of NY 17 and NY 339 south of Ramapo were flipped, placing NY 17 on the western route.

In 1938, NY 17 was relocated onto a new highway through the Hillburn village limits. While the southern half of the new road utilized the old highway, the northern half veered to the west of both Hillburn and old NY 17, bypassing the village before rejoining the old road south of Ramapo.

===Late 20th century conversion into expressway and later improvements===

The explosive growth of the tourism industry in the Catskill Mountains region, which began in the 1930s and intensified after World War II, stretched the rural road to its limits. Scores of hotels, resorts and bungalow colonies attracted hundreds of thousands of vacationing New Yorkers, whose cars left the two-lane NY 17 hopelessly jammed in summer. Many towns, especially the fairly large city of Middletown, were paralyzed on Friday evenings and Sunday afternoons in the summertime, as traffic passed through local downtowns and their traffic lights. In addition, the tight turns and steep inclines along the route led to numerous fatal crashes, including two milk tanker truck crashes in the mid-1950s. In response, New York State officials planned a four-lane replacement, the first free long-distance expressway in the state and one of the earliest in the United States. It would replace intersections with well-spaced access ramps, separate grades with flyovers, and allow safe travel at up to .

The first segment of the new highway extended from Fair Oaks to Goshen, bypassing the city of Middletown to the northeast. It opened to traffic in July 1951 as a realignment of NY 17. As more sections of the freeway—known as the Quickway—opened up during the 1950s and 1960s, NY 17 was moved onto them. The Quickway was completed by 1968, connecting Binghamton to Harriman by way of a continuous expressway. Farther west, plans were also in the works to build an expressway across the Southern Tier. The highway was first proposed by New York Governor Thomas Dewey in 1953, and the first sections of the Southern Tier Expressway were completed in the mid-1960s. At the time, NY 17 followed the entirety of two of the four open sections (Steamburg to Salamanca and Owego to the Broome County line) and part of a third (Corning to Lowman via Elmira).

As more continuous pieces of the expressway opened during the 1970s, NY 17 was realigned onto them, with much of NY 17&#x27;s old alignment becoming NY 394, NY 417, or NY 17C. By 1980, the expressway was complete from Bemus Point to Binghamton except for two areas near Salamanca and Corning. Although NY 17 continued to extend northwestward along its original alignment from Bemus Point to Westfield, both highways were also designated as parts of NY 430 and NY 394 in anticipation of the completion of the Southern Tier Expressway west of Chautauqua Lake, which NY 17 would be rerouted to follow. This segment was built in stages during the 1980s as a super two highway. The portions of the freeway in and around Salamanca and Corning were completed in the late 1980s and mid-1990s, completing the conversion of NY 17 into a continuous expressway from the Pennsylvania state line to Harriman.

In 1996, both exit 117 and exit 118A were closed.

The large portion of the road west of Chautauqua Lake was widened to four lanes as part of a project completed in 1997.

On December 3, 1999, the westernmost of NY 17 were replaced by I-86, a new route that had been written into law a year earlier. As legislated, I-86 will eventually extend eastward along the length of both the Southern Tier Expressway and the Quickway to the New York State Thruway in Harriman once both highways are brought up to Interstate Highway standards.

I-86 was extended east to Horseheads in 2004, and Elmira in 2008.

A stretch of NY 17 in central Broome County was designated as I-86 in 2006.

In September 2013, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) approved a extension of the I-86 designation from exit 56 in Elmira to the Tioga county line. The remainder of NY 17 west of I-87 was designated after the remaining at-grade sections are eliminated and the highway is brought up to Interstate Highway standards.

The New York State Thruway Authority converted the Harriman Toll Barrier at the interchange of NY 17 and I-87 (exit 16 on I-87) to cashless tolling. This included the creation of a solar photovoltaic energy generating facility (solar park) to help power the toll and maintenance facilities in Harriman, Woodbury, Spring Valley, and Nyack. Cashless tolling began on the night of September 27, 2018. This was a part of Governor Andrew Cuomo&#x27;s goal to convert the entirety of the New York Thruway to cashless tolling.
On August 9, 2019, Governor Andrew Cuomo signed into law that a portion of NY 17 was to be designated the &quot;Dennis &#x27;Matt&#x27; Howe Memorial Highway&quot; from exit 63 in the hamlet of Lounsberry to exit 62 in the village of Nichols. On March 18, 2019, Howe died from injuries sustained when a tractor-trailer collided with his DOT truck as he and others were performing highway safety work on NY 17. The signs were unveiled and the dedication ceremony was held on October 29, 2019.

In November 2019, NYSDOT completed the reconstruction of exit 131 along NY 17. As part of the project, a diverging diamond interchange was built at the exit to improve access between NY 17 and NY 32. Also as part of the project, NY 32 was widened to three lanes to each way; CR 64 / Nininger Road was extended to Woodbury Common Premium Outlets; and exit ramps were built from NY 32 north and NY 32 south to meet Nininger Road at two respective traffic circles. In addition, a new park-and-ride was built, and the ramp from NY 17 west to Woodbury Common was demolished.

In December 2020, NYSDOT completed construction of a new exit 125, which was built to accommodate the new Legoland New York. As part of the project, a four-ramp parclo was built, which replaced the prior exit 125, located west. NY 17 was expanded to three lanes in each direction between exits 124 and 125. Harriman Drive was expanded to two lanes in each direction between the exit and Legoland&#x27;s entrance.

On November 14, 2024, NYSDOT announced the extension of the I-86 designation from exit 60 to exit 67 (NY 26) in Vestal.

== Future ==

=== Widening in Orange and Sullivan counties ===
NYSDOT has requested proposals for plans to widen NY 17 between the Thruway in Orange County and the town of Liberty in Sullivan County. The widening is supported by the 17-Forward-86 coalition, several state senators, and various businesses and organizations in the area.

New York State Department of Transportation wants to begin a $1.3 billion project in the Catskill Mountains section of the route.

==Major intersections==





























==Suffixed routes==

NY 17 has had 13 suffixed routes bearing 11 different designations. Five are still assigned to their routes, while eight have been removed or renumbered. A fourteenth, NY 17L, was proposed in 1939 as part of current NY 97, but canceled.

*The NY 17A designation has been used for two distinct highways:
**The first NY 17A was an alternate route of NY 17 between Randolph and Salamanca via Little Valley. It was assigned in the mid-1920s and renumbered to NY 17H in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York.
**The current NY 17A () is an alternate route of NY 17 between Goshen and Southfields that connects NY 17 to Warwick in Orange County. It was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering.
*NY 17B () is a spur of NY 17 connecting Monticello to NY 97 in Callicoon. When it was originally assigned in 1930, it also extended northward to Hancock via modern NY 97.
*NY 17C () is an alternate route of NY 17 between Waverly and Binghamton in Tioga and Broome counties. The western terminus of the route was initially located in Owego upon being assigned in 1930.
*NY 17D was a spur of NY 17 in the vicinity of Elmira, Chemung County that ran from downtown Elmira to the Pennsylvania border east of Wellsburg. The route, assigned in 1930, was renumbered to NY 427 in the early 1940s.
*NY 17E was an alternate route of NY 17 between Big Flats and Elmira in Chemung County. The route, assigned in 1930, was renumbered to NY 352 in October 1966 after local community pressure.
*NY 17F was an alternate route of NY 17 between Andover, Allegany County, and Addison, Steuben County. The route, assigned in 1930, was a northerly alternate route of NY 17 that served Hornell and Canisteo. NY 17F was removed in the early 1940s and is now NY 21, NY 36 and Steuben County&#x27;s CR 119.
*NY 17G was a spur assigned in 1930 to what is now NY 248 south of NY 417. It became part of an extended NY 248 in the early 1940s.
*The NY 17H designation has been used for two distinct highways:
**The first NY 17H was an alternate route of NY 17 between Randolph and Salamanca via Little Valley in Cattaraugus County. It was assigned in 1930 and removed . The route became part of an extended NY 242 west of Little Valley and remained part of NY 18 (which NY 17H overlapped) east of the village (that portion of NY 18 became NY 353 in 1962).
**The second NY 17H was a spur route of NY 17 in the vicinity of Binghamton. The route began at NY 17 in Binghamton and followed Riverside Drive west and north to Johnson City, where it ended at NY 17C. It was assigned by 1940 and partially replaced with NY 201 in September 1971.
*NY 17J was a westerly alternate route of NY 17 between Mayville and Jamestown along the western edge of Chautauqua Lake. It was assigned in 1930 and supplanted by NY 394 in November 1973.
*NY 17K () is a spur linking NY 17 in Bloomingburg to US 9W and NY 32 in Newburgh, Orange County. It was assigned .
*NY 17M () is the former routing of NY 17 in Orange County. The route begins north of Middletown in Fair Oaks and rejoins NY 17 in Harriman. It was assigned in 1951.

The new capital encompassed a large part of modern Muko, where modern research has revealed the palace to have been located. In the south, it also included parts of Nagaokakyō. In 794, because of the location&#x27;s moist temperature and reputation as a breeding ground for disease, Kammu relocated his capital from Nagaoka to Heian-kyō, now known as Kyoto. Mukō developed as a market town in 1592, during Azuchi–Momoyama period. The town&#x27;s main road, called Saigoku Kaido, flourished because it connected Tō-ji in Kyoto and Nishinomiya Shrine in Settsu Province. Saigoku Kaido, which still presents a traditional and historical setting, changed name National Route 171 as important road.

Mukō was elevated to city status on October 1, 1972.

==Government==

Mukō, collectively with Nagaokakyō, contributes two members to the Kyoto Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the Kyoto 3rd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

<text>Châteauguay ( , , ) is an off-island suburb of Montreal, in southwestern Quebec, located on both the Châteauguay River and Lac St-Louis, which is a section of the St. Lawrence River. The population of the city of Châteauguay at the 2021 Census was 50,815, and the population centre was 75,891.

==History==

The land was first given to Charles Lemoyne by the governor of New France at the time, the Comte de Frontenac with the intention of setting up a seigneurie in the area. Afterwards the seigneurie was assumed by Zacharie Robutel de la Noue in 1706. In 1763 France relinquished its claims in Canada and Châteauguay was now under British mandate. The seigneurie was bought by Marguerite d&#x27;Youville, a founder of the Quebec religious society the Grey Nuns in 1765 and 10 years later construction began on the Church of Saint-Joachim.

Châteauguay played an important part in the colonial history of North America. With the United States having declared war on Britain in 1812, Châteauguay was seen as little more than a good vantage point to post troops to defend Montreal against an invasion. This prong of the American advance on Montreal ended with the Battle of the Châteauguay, where on October 26, 1813, Lieutenant Colonel Charles de Salaberry succeeded in halting the American force of 4,000 advancing on Montreal with only some 400 troops, mostly French-Canadian and 170 Kahnawake Mohawk warriors. The second American incursion towards Montreal was defeated shortly after at Crysler&#x27;s Farm on November 11.

During the Lower Canada Rebellion, Châteauguay was the scene of a notable action involving the Patriote movement. In November 1838, members of the rebel group, including some of their leaders, were arrested: François-Maurice Lepailleur, who was later exiled to Australia, and two natives of Châteauguay, Joseph Duquet and Joseph-Narcisse Cardinal, both of whom were later hanged at Au-Pied-du-Courant Prison and subsequently interred beneath a monument to the Patriotes at Notre-Dame-des-Neiges Cemetery in Montreal.

The actual village of Châteauguay was created in 1855, after the abolition of the seigneurie system in Quebec by the United Province of Canada. Later on the city annexed two neighbouring districts, Châteauguay-Heights (1968) and Châteauguay-Centre (1975). In 1982, with the passage of the Loi sur l&#x27;aménagement et l&#x27;urbanisme, Québec, the city became part of the Roussillon Regional County Municipality.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Châteauguay had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.
Châteauguay has traditionally had one of the highest proportions of English speakers in the Montérégie region. As according to the 2021 census, The prominent languages primarily spoken at home by their relative share of the population are French (56%), English (29%) and Spanish (2%).

53.4% of residents speak French as a mother tongue. Other common first languages are English (25.1%), Spanish (3.1%), Russian (2.0%), Arabic (1.9%), and Romanian (1.2%). 3.0% claim both French and English as mother tongues, while 1.1% claim both French and a non-official language.

As of 2021, Châteauguay is 66.3% Christian, down from 84.0% in 2011. 46.5% are Catholic, 7.2% are Christian n.o.s and 5.5% are Protestant. All other Christian denominations and Christian-related traditions made up 7.0% of the population including a significant community of Christian Orthodox believers (3.1%). 25.6% of residents were non-religious or secular, up from 12.1% in 2011. Other religions account for 8.1% of the population. The largest non-Christian religion is Islam, at 6.5% of residents (2.3% in 2011).

Châteauguay is 74.3% white/European, 2.7% Indigenous and 23.0% visible minorities. The largest visible minority groups are Black (11.5%), Arab (3.3%), Latin American (3.1%), and South Asian (1.5%). Châteauguay holds the highest percentage, outside of the Island of Montreal, of Black population in Quebec, which is mostly concentrated in the easternmost part of the city. 

==Government==

The current mayor of Châteauguay is Eric Allard who won election in November 2021.

Allard served as a city council member under the previous mayor, Pierre-Paul Routhier. Routhier was mayor from 2017 to 2021, and was preceded by Nathalie Simon who was elected mayor in 2009.

==Infrastructure==

===Public security===

The Châteauguay Police have more than 130 police officers. Their duties include investigations, crime prevention and routine city patrols. The force also participates in many community efforts. The majority of these outreach programs are aimed at Châteauguay youth and focus on the prevention of drug and alcohol use which is widespread among the youth (up to 78% of the teens have used a drug on the course of last month according to a survey). The force, originally having only jurisdiction within the city limits expanded its jurisdiction over the nearby cities of Léry, Mercier, Beauharnois and Saint-Isidore between 2002 and 2007 through agreements between the municipalities. However, Mercier set up an independent policing system in 2019.

===Utilities===
Since 1984, Châteauguay has been home to one of the largest HVDC-back-to-back stations in the world with an operating voltage of 140 kV and a maximum transmission rate of 1000 MW.

==Transport==
===Public transit===

Public transportation is assured by CITSO (Conseil Intermunicipal de Transport du Sud-Ouest). They run two Châteauguay-Angrignon loop bus routes circulating in opposite directions. A city minibus transfers commuters from the western part of the suburb to the downtown, where the other off-peak routes pass. During rush hours, more bus routes connect the various neighbourhoods with the Angrignon bus terminal and metro station. A special express bus route connects western Châteauguay and the Châteauguay Park-and-ride with downtown Montreal, only during rush hours. A reserved lane on Highway 138 eastbound makes the connection significantly faster when the Mercier Bridge is congested. The Châteauguay public transit system also offers a &quot;Taxi-Bus&quot; service which allows those people who live outside of the normal bus routes to, by way of transfer, use a taxi funded by CITSO to drop them off at specific points in the city usually within walking distance of their residence.

==Education==
The majority of the education institutions within Châteauguay are public, with the exception of Collège Héritage. A small list of Châteauguay schools includes:

* Collège Héritage - Semi-private high school for French-speaking students (also houses 5th and 6th grade elementary school students).

NOVA Career Centre for adult students recently established itself in a building adjacent to Howard S. Billings. It was previously located in the school building.

During the 1980s, three English elementary schools became French due to a demographic shift:
*St-Paul School: The first, an English Catholic elementary school. It remained at the time property of the Commission Scolaire de Châteauguay. It was later renamed École des Trois Sources.
*Julius Richardson: The oldest of the English elementary schools in Châteauguay. It closed in the early 80s and became the Centre l&#x27;Accore d&#x27;Abottsford, later becoming an adult education centre. It was a school belonging to the then &quot;Chateauguay Valley School Board&quot; before being ceded to the &quot;Commission Scolaire de Châteauguay&quot;.
*Robert A. Jobber: The final English school to close. It was shuttered at the end of the 1987–88 school year. During its final years, classroom space was leased out to the Catholic school board to house grade 6 students from neighboring École Laberge. Robert A. Jobber, which is architecturally identical to Centennial Park school, became École Gabrielle Roy. To maintain the Robert A. Jobber name, the gymnasium at Centennial Park was named in his honour.

<text>Lévis () is a city in eastern Quebec, Canada, located on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River, opposite Quebec City. A ferry links Old Quebec with Old Lévis, and two bridges, the Quebec Bridge and the Pierre-Laporte Bridge, connect western Lévis with Quebec City.

The population in 2021 was 149,683. Its current incarnation was founded on January 1, 2002, as the result of a merger among ten cities, including the older city of Lévis founded in 1861.

Lévis is also the name of a territory equivalent to a regional county municipality (TE) and census division (CD) of Quebec, coextensive with the city of Lévis. Its geographical code is 25 as a census division, and 251 as an RCM-equivalent territory.

==History==
First Nations and prehistoric indigenous peoples settled in this area for thousands of years due to its ideal location at the confluence of the Chaudière and the St. Lawrence rivers. Many archeological sites reveal evidence of human occupation dating to 10,000 BP. Some historians theorize that Pointe-Lévy could have been one of the main centres of Native American population development in what became the province of Québec.

In 1636, approximately 28 years after the French founded Quebec City, the seignory of Lauzon was founded on the eastern part of this territory. In the following years, other seignories were founded near the St. Lawrence River. Pointe-Lévy was primarily developed as an agricultural domain, in which several land-owners (&quot;Seigneurs&quot;) controlled their part of land in a medieval feudal system.

The land of the Lauzon seignory remained unoccupied until 1647, when Guillaume Couture became the first French settler installed by Quebec City. Couture was serving as the first Administrator, Chief Magistrate, Captain of the Militia, and member of the Sovereign Council; he was widely considered a hero among colonists in New France. Couture, however, was not the first &#x27;Seigneur&#x27; of the Lauzon Seignory, as the land had been previously owned by Jean de Lauson (French Governor between 1651 and 1657).

During the Seven Years&#x27; War, in the summer of 1759, British General James Wolfe established a camp in the territory of Pointe-Lévy and laid siege to Quebec City. The siege succeeded. After being under bombardment for three months and fighting the English in the battle on the Plains of Abraham in front of the walls, Quebec fell to the British. During this time, Pointe-Lévy served as the main encampment of the British army in the Quebec area. The constant cannon firing between Quebec City and Pointe-Lévy discouraged both French and British ships from advancing further up the St. Lawrence, and reinforcements and supplies did not reach other major cities such as Montréal.

In 1763, after the English took over French territory east of the Mississippi River in North America, a jury convicted Marie-Josephte Corriveau, &quot;la Corriveau&quot;, of murdering her husband with a pitch-fork and she was condemned to death. She was hanged in Quebec City, and the British displayed her body in a cage for several weeks in Saint-Joseph-de-la-Pointe-Lévy (old part of the former City of Lauzon). This was the first time they had used this practice in North America; it was reserved for persons found guilty of particularly heinous crimes. This punishment had been practised in England since the Middle Ages.
From 1854, the railroad was constructed to Pointe-Lévy; it became a major transportation centre for commerce and immigration. As it was located on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River, Pointe-Levy could be connected by rail to Ontario and the Maritime Provinces, as well as to Maine and all the United States.

Between 1865 and 1872, the British constructed three forts in order to protect the City of Quebec and its surroundings, from the threat of an American invasion in the aftermath of its civil war. The British had maintained relations with the Confederacy during the war and at times helped its ships evade the Union blockade, so feared retaliation. Those garrisons never had to serve their intended purpose. One of them, Fort-Chambly, still stands to this day and is open to the public.

The City of Lévis, named after the successor to Montcalm, the Chevalier de Levis, was developed beginning in 1861. Its founder was Monsignor Joseph-David Déziel (1806–1882). As more settlements developed, there were changes among the municipalities in the territory of present-day Lévis; many were merged between 1861 and 2002, reflecting changes in governance. The Village of Pointe-Levy (or Saint-Joseph-de-la-Pointe-Lévy) was renamed as the Village of Lauzon in 1867 and incorporated as the City of Lauzon in 1910.

In the late 19th and beginning of the 20th century, Alphonse Desjardins pioneered the credit union movement, establishing the first &quot;caisse populaire&quot; in Lévis. He began developing what later became the Desjardins Group by travelling throughout Quebec and helping people in other cities start their own credit unions.

===Legacy===
On June 28, 1985 Canada Post issued &quot;Fort No.1, Point Levis, Que.&quot;, one of 20 stamps in the &quot;Forts Across Canada Series&quot; (1983 and 1985). The stamps are perforated x 13 mm and were printed by Ashton-Potter Limited, based on the designs by Rolf P. Harder.

==Geography==

Lévis covers an area of : 10% urban, 48% farmlands, 36% forests and 6% wetlands. In addition to the Saint Lawrence River, the Etchemin and Chaudière rivers also run through the city before ending their journey into the Saint Lawrence. The Chaudière River also boasts a waterfall with a suspended bridge, which can be accessed from Autoroute 73.

Lévis County existed until January 1982 when it was divided into Desjardins Regional County Municipality and Les Chutes-de-la-Chaudière Regional County Municipality.

On January 1, 2002, ten cities were merged by the Quebec provincial government to form the new city of Lévis. Previously, the former cities of Lauzon and Saint-David-de-l&#x27;Auberivière had been merged to Lévis in 1989. The regional county municipalities of which these cities were a part ceased to exist.
===Boroughs===
The new city was divided into three &quot;arrondissements&quot; or boroughs. Desjardins, Les Chutes-de-la-Chaudière-Ouest and Les Chutes-de-la-Chaudière-Est, which correspond to most of the territory of the former RCMs (however, Saint-Henri and Saint-Lambert-de-Lauzon remained independent and did not amalgamate into Lévis).

The ten former municipalities are today districts (&quot;secteurs&quot;) within the city; each of the three boroughs is composed of either three or four districts.

=== Former municipalities (10) ===
*Lévis (pre-2002 borders of the city)
*Charny
*Pintendre
*Sainte-Hélène-de-Breakeyville
*Saint-Étienne-de-Lauzon
*Saint-Jean-Chrysostome
*Saint-Joseph-de-la-Pointe-de-Lévy
*Saint-Nicolas
*Saint-Romuald
*Saint-Rédempteur

The pre-2002 Lévis had already merged with Lauzon and Saint-David-de-l&#x27;Auberivière in 1989.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Lévis had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.
=== Ethnicity ===
The city is one of the most homogeneous in Canada: around 95% of the population is of European ancestry.

*Note: Totals greater than 100% due to multiple origin responses.

=== Language ===
Over 95% of residents speak French as their mother tongue.

==Economy==
Although a relatively small city, Lévis is not a typical suburb. The presence of several large employers has allowed many citizens to both live and work in Lévis. It is home to Valero&#x27;s Jean-Gaulin refinery, one of the largest in eastern Canada, Frito-Lay and Davie Shipbuilding are located in the borough of Lauzon (former city). The Desjardins Group, as well as its subsidiary Desjardins Financial Security, are headquartered in the city. The founder, Alphonse Desjardins, lived in Lévis and, with his wife, Dorimène Roy Desjardins, ran the first &quot;Caisse Populaire&quot; (similar to a credit union) from their home. The city is also a major agricultural business research and development centre. More high technology companies, such as Creaform (3D), have been established in Lévis.

Lévis is home to the enclosed regional shopping mall Les Galeries Chagnon which has 106 stores.

Many small business and entertainment developed in the city during the last decade and finalized the transformation from a Quebec City suburb into a small city.

==Education==
Commission scolaire des Navigateurs operates Francophone public schools.

There are many schools of different levels, including the Cégep de Lévis and a UQAR campus (Université du Québec à Rimouski).

<text>Daryle Pasquale Lamonica (July 17, 1941 – April 21, 2022) was an American professional football quarterback who played in the American Football League (AFL) and the National Football League (NFL) for 12 seasons, primarily with the Oakland Raiders. Lamonica was drafted by the NFL Green Bay Packers in round 12 with the 168th overall pick. He spent his first four seasons mostly as a backup for the Buffalo Bills, who selected him in the 24th round of the 1963 AFL Draft. Lamonica played his next eight seasons as the primary starter of the Raiders, including after they joined the NFL through the AFL–NFL merger.

Nicknamed &quot;the Mad Bomber&quot; due to his affinity for throwing the long pass in virtually any situation, Lamonica led the Raiders to four consecutive division titles between 1967 and 1970, along with an appearance in Super Bowl II. Lamonica was twice named AFL Most Valuable Player (the only player to win multiple league MVPs in its history), in addition to receiving three AFL All-Star selections, two NFL Pro Bowl selections, and two first-team All-AFL honors. He was also the AFL leader in passing touchdowns during both MVP seasons and the passing yards leader during the second. Lamonica holds the NFL&#x27;s second-highest quarterback winning percentage and the AFL&#x27;s highest quarterback winning percentage.

==Early life==
Of Italian and Irish ancestry, Lamonica grew up on a ranch in the Central Valley of California. Lamonica played in the first Little League World Series. He lettered in four sports and was an all-state quarterback at Clovis High School in Clovis, a Fresno suburb. In 1974, the high school named its football stadium after him. After high school, he turned down a professional baseball contract with the Chicago Cubs. Lamonica played college football at the University of Notre Dame, and was the team&#x27;s starting quarterback for three seasons. In 30 total games from 1960 through 1962, he had 99 completions for 211 attempts for a 46.9 completion percentage and 1,363 yards, with eight touchdowns and 16 interceptions. He rushed 144 times for 353 yards and 10 touchdowns. He participated in the 1962 East-West Shrine Game held at Kezar Stadium in San Francisco, passing 20-for-28 with 349 yards while being named Most Valuable Player.

==Professional football==
===Buffalo Bills===
Lamonica was drafted by the Buffalo Bills in the 24th round of the 1963 AFL draft. He was also selected by the two-time defending NFL champion Green Bay Packers in the 12th round of the 1963 NFL draft. He chose to go with the Bills, as he perceived his chances of playing were better there. In his rookie year, he played sparingly in games with Jack Kemp being the primary quarterback while Lamonica came into duty after injuries or ineffectiveness, which led to him being dubbed &quot;the Fireman&quot;. However, he was tasked to start the last two games for the Bills. In each, he led them to victory, notably going 10-for-16 with 115 yards with a touchdown in a 45–14 win over the New York Jets. For the season, he had 33 completions on 71 attempts for 437 yards, with three touchdowns and four interceptions. In the tiebreaker playoff for the division title, he came on for Kemp late in the game, going 9-for-24 for 168 yards with a touchdown and three interceptions, as the Bills lost 26–8 at home to the Boston Patriots.

Lamonica had much of the same in terms of playing time in 1964, going 55 of 128 with 1,137 yards with six touchdowns and eight interceptions. On rushing, he was most efficient, having 55 carries for 289 yards (a 5.3 average per carry) for six touchdowns, which was tied for the most in the league alongside others such as Sid Blanks and his teammate Cookie Gilchrist. He started one of the last games of the season against the Denver Broncos, going 6-of-21 for 89 yards with a touchdown and interception, but Buffalo prevailed 30–19. In 1965, the same was true once again. He went 29 of 70 for 376 yards, with three touchdowns and six interceptions. For the third and final season, he started a game for the Bills, going 3-of-14 for 83 yards with a touchdown and interception in a 29–18 win over the Houston Oilers. For his fourth and final year in Buffalo in 1966, he went 33-of-84 for 549 yards, having four touchdowns and five interceptions. In the three Buffalo runs to the AFL title game from 1964 to 1966, he had minimal participation, throwing only one pass.

===Oakland Raiders===
On March 14, 1967, Lamonica was traded to the Oakland Raiders with Glenn Bass for Art Powell and Tom Flores. He played with Oakland until his final year in 1974. With John Rauch at the helm as coach, Lamonica thrived from the start. In 1967 he threw 220-for-425 for 3,228 yards with thirty touchdowns and twenty interceptions while rushing for four touchdowns. The team went 13–1 in the regular season and won the division title with Lamonica at the helm; in the AFL title game against the Oilers on December 31, he went 10-of-24 for 111 yards with two touchdowns as the Raiders won, 40–7, to win their first championship as a franchise. Two weeks later, he faced off against the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl II. He went 15-of-34 for 208 yards, with two touchdowns and one interception (returned by Herb Adderley for a touchdown), as the Raiders lost 33–14. Lamonica was given the American Football League Most Valuable Player Award for the season by United Press International, the Associated Press, and &quot;The Sporting News&quot;.

In 1968 he was efficient once again, going 206-of-416 for 3,245 yards in thirteen games (Lamonica missed the ninth game of the season, which George Blanda started). He threw 25 touchdowns and fifteen interceptions. His longest completed pass was 82 yards, his longest as a Raider for his career. He threw 249.6 yards per game, a career high. In the infamous &quot;Heidi&quot; Game, he went 21-of-34 for 311 yards with four touchdowns and two interceptions, with his final touchdown to Charlie Smith being the deciding points in a nail-biting victory. The Raiders charged to a 12–2 record, tied with Kansas City for the best record in the Western Division. They trounced the Chiefs 41–6 to return to the AFL championship. Playing against the New York Jets at Shea Stadium, Lamonica went 20-of-47 for 401 yards with a touchdown, but the Jets rallied to defeat Oakland 27–23.

Lamonica was consistent once again in 1969 (the last for the AFL and first for John Madden as coach). He had career highs with 221 completions, 426 attempts, 3,302 yards, 34 touchdowns, and 25 interceptions. He had 235.9 yards per game. The Raiders went 12–1–1, winning the Western Division once again. On October 19, against the Buffalo Bills, Lamonica set a new record with six touchdown passes in the first half, a record that has been matched only once, by Aaron Rodgers against the Chicago Bears on November 9, 2014. Lamonica&#x27;s team went to the playoffs once again, which had been expanded to four teams for the final year of the AFL. In the divisional playoff game versus overmatched Houston, he threw 13-of-17 for 276 yards with six touchdowns and one interception for a 56–7 victory. In the AFL Championship Game (the last game between two AFL teams), facing the Chiefs in Oakland, Lamonica threw 15-of-39 for 167 yards and three interceptions as the Chiefs won, 17–7, to advance to Super Bowl IV. Lamonica was given the American Football League Most Valuable Player Award for the season by United Press International and &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, with Joe Namath being named Most Valuable Player by the Associated Press. It was in Oakland that Lamonica&#x27;s affinity for - and talent in - long passes earned him the nickname &quot;the Mad Bomber&quot;.

Lamonica regressed a bit for 1970, throwing 179-of-356 for 2,516 yards with 22 touchdowns and fifteen interceptions as the team went 8–4–2. The team was aided by the fourth quarter heroics of George Blanda, who came off the bench for Lamonica in five straight games (games six to ten) in the fourth quarter, helping them win four games and tie once. The team snuck through into the NFL playoffs, edging out Kansas City for the newly installed AFC West division title. In their divisional playoff, Lamonica went 8-of-16 for 187 yards and two touchdowns as the Raiders prevailed, 21–14, over the Miami Dolphins in Oakland. In the AFC Championship Game against the Baltimore Colts, Lamonica went 1-of-4 for six yards before a hit by Bubba Smith resulted in him being taken out for Blanda as the Raiders were beaten, 27–17.

On September 17, 1972, Lamonica had a perfect passing rating of 158.3. In a game that was started by Ken Stabler with additional play from George Blanda, Lamonica stepped in to throw 8-of-10 for 172 yards with two touchdowns, turning a 27
–7 trouncing by the Pittsburgh Steelers into a 34–28 loss. Lamonica started the remaining thirteen games for the season. He had 149 completions on 281 attempts for 1,998 yards, having a career-high 53.0 completion percentage while throwing eighteen touchdowns and twelve interceptions. The team went 10-2-1 for the year and won the Western Division title. In the divisional playoff game that year against Pittsburgh at Three Rivers Stadium on December 23, he went 6-of-18 for 45 yards with two interceptions. Ken Stabler stepped in late in the game, and while he only went 6-of-12 for 57 yards, his thirty-yard rush for a touchdown gave the Raiders a late 7–6 lead with less than two minutes remaining. However, Franco Harris caught a tipped pass from Terry Bradshaw in what is now known as the Immaculate Reception to give Pittsburgh a 13–7 victory. It was Lamonica&#x27;s last playoff appearance.

With Lamonica, the Raiders won four straight Western Division titles (three AFL and one AFC) and one American Football League championship. Lamonica was a three-time American Football League All-Star and twice was selected as the AFL&#x27;s Most Valuable Player, in 1967 and 1969. Lamonica went as a starter, second-best in NFL history (Otto Graham is the highest at .810). In the American Football League, Lamonica&#x27;s winning percentage as a starter was , on 40 wins, 4 losses and 1 tie in 45 games, the best ever in the AFL. Although excellent at man-for-man coverage, he had a hard time reading zone defenses, more prevalent in the 1970s, and his throwing was sometimes inaccurate. As a Raider starter from 1967 to 1972, his best completion average was 53.0% (in 1972).

Lamonica was replaced in 1973 by future Pro Football Hall of Famer Ken Stabler, who was better at reading defenses and more accurate, leading the 1976 team to victory in Super Bowl XI.

===World Football League===
Lamonica was the 25th player to jump from the NFL to the World Football League (WFL) on April 16, 1974, when he signed a multiyear contract to join the Southern California Sun in 1975. He went 9-of-19 for ninety yards and one touchdown in limited playing time in his only season in the WFL which folded in late October of that year.

==Career statistics==

=== Regular season ===
==After football==
In later years, he hosted a national fishing show on Fox Sports Net called &quot;Outdoors with the Pros&quot;.

In 2013, Football Nation named Lamonica the 67th best quarterback since the 1970 merger. The Professional Football Researchers Association named Lamonica to their Hall of Very Good Class of 2013.

On April 21, 2022, he died at the age of 80 in his sleep at his home in Fresno, California.

<text>Sir Henry Bartle Edward Frere, 1st Baronet, (29 March 1815 – 29 May 1884) was a British colonial administrator. He had a successful career in India, rising to become Governor of Bombay (1862–1867). However, as High Commissioner for Southern Africa (1877–1880), he implemented a set of policies which attempted to impose a British confederation on the region and which led to the overthrow of the Cape Colony&#x27;s first elected government in 1878 and to a string of regional wars, culminating in the invasion of Zululand (1879) and the First Boer War (1880–1881). The British Prime Minister, Gladstone, recalled Frere to London to face charges of misconduct; Whitehall officially censured Frere for acting recklessly.

== Early life ==

Frere was born at Clydach House, Clydach, Monmouthshire, the son of Edward Frere, manager of Clydach Ironworks, and Mary Ann Green. His elder sister, Mary Anne Frere, was born in Clydach, and his younger sister, Frances Anne Frere, was born in Clydach. He was the grandson of John Frere and a nephew of John Hookham Frere; William Frere; Bartholomew Frere; James Hatley Frere; and Temple Frere – canon of Westminster Abbey. He was educated at the East India Company College, the precursor of Haileybury and Imperial Service College.

== Family life ==

On 10 October 1844, he married Catherine Arthur, daughter of Sir George Arthur, 1st Baronet, who was the Governor of Bombay and to whom he had been appointed private secretary two years earlier. 

Their five children were: Mary Eliza Isabella Frere (born 1845 at Bitton, Gloucestershire); Catherine Frances Frere (born 1849 in the East Indies, who edited &quot;The Cookery Book of Lady Clark of Tillypronie&quot; in 1909); Georgina Hamilton Chichester Frere (born c. 1850 in the East Indies); Bartle Compton Arthur Frere (born c. 1855 in Paddington, Middlesex); and Eliza Frederica Jane Frere (born c. 1857 in Wimbledon, London).

== India ==

After leaving the East India Company College Frere was appointed a writer in the Bombay Presidency civil service in 1834. Having passed his language examination, he was appointed assistant collector at Poona in 1835, and in 1842 he was chosen as private secretary to Sir George Arthur, Governor of Bombay. Two years later he became a political resident at the court of Raja Shahaji of Satara; on the raja&#x27;s death in 1848 he administered the province both before and after its formal annexation in 1849.

=== Commissioner in Sindh ===

In 1850 he was appointed chief commissioner of Sindh. In 1851 he reformed the Scinde District postal system on the model of the British postal service, to provide better service with Rowland Hill&#x27;s &quot;low and uniform&quot; postal rates. This system became the basis for India&#x27;s postal system, designed to provide public service. In 1857, he sent detachments to Multan and to Sir John Lawrence in the Punjab in order to secure those locations during the Indian Mutiny. These services were fully recognized, as he received the thanks of both houses of Parliament and was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB).

As the chief commissioner of Sindh, in 1851, Frere issued a decree making it compulsory to use Sindhi language in place of Persian in Sindh. The officers of Sindh were ordered to learn Sindhi compulsorily to enable them to carry on day-to-day work efficiently. A committee was constituted (1853) under Asst. Commissioner &amp; Chief of Education Department, with an equal number of Hindu and Muslim members, which unanimously decided on the use of Persio-Arabic Sindhi script with slight modifications. Frere not only gave Sindhi language one script but he even published different Sindhi books related to various streams of the literature, which encouraged impetus to Sindhi writers to move quickly with literacy.

=== Governor of Bombay ===

He became a member of the Viceroy&#x27;s Council in 1859, and in 1862 was appointed Governor of Bombay, where he continued his policy of municipal improvements, establishing the Deccan College at Pune, as well as a college for instructing Indians in civil engineering. A 5-mile road in Kirkee Cantonment was named after him circa 1865. His order to pull down the ramparts of the old Bombay Fort allowed the city to grow, and the Flora Fountain was commissioned in his honour. During Frere&#x27;s administration his daughter, Mary Frere, collected &quot;Old Deccan Days&quot; (1868), the first English-language field-collected book of Indian folklore.

In 1867 he returned to England, where he was made GCSI, and given honorary degrees from Oxford and Cambridge;. He was also appointed a member of the Council of India.

== Africa ==
In 1872, the Foreign Office sent him to Zanzibar to negotiate a treaty with the sultan, Barghash bin Said, for the suppression of the slave traffic, the Frere Treaty. On 4 August 1873 he was sworn in as a member of Privy Council at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. In 1875, he accompanied the Prince of Wales to Egypt and India, with such success that Lord Beaconsfield asked him to choose between being made a baronet or a Knight Grand Cross of the Bath. He chose the former, but Queen Victoria bestowed both honours upon him.

== High Commissioner for Southern Africa ==
In 1877, Frere was made High Commissioner for Southern Africa and governor of the Cape Colony by the London-based Secretary of State for the Colonies Henry Howard Molyneux Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon, who continued to support the imposition of the unpopular system of confederation upon the southern Africa region. Frere accepted the position, on a salary double that of his predecessor, and with the understanding that successful implementation of confederation would result in his being appointed the first British Governor-General of a federated southern African dominion.

=== Attempt to federate Southern Africa ===

The idea of melding the states of southern Africa into a British Confederation was not new. It was seen as an easy way of uniting the region under British control, while preventing any future attempt among the remaining independent African states to unite against British rule. However an earlier plan by Sir George Grey for a federation of all the various colonies in South Africa had been rejected by the home authorities in 1858, as not being viable.

Through Frere&#x27;s elevation, Lord Carnarvon sought another attempt at implementing the ill-fated and locally unsupported confederation scheme, that was met with resistance by all the local groups involved. South Africans resented the perceived high-handed manner in which it was being imposed from London with little accommodation and knowledge of, or concern for, local conditions and politics. Cape Prime Minister, John Charles Molteno, advised that under current conditions confederation was ill-suited to and badly timed for Southern Africa. It would lead to a lop-sided confederation with resulting instability and resentment. He advised that full union status was a better model, but only at a later date and once it was economically viable.

Timing was a key factor in the ensuing events, as the different states of southern Africa were at the time still suspicious and resentful after the last bout of British imperial expansion. The Afrikaners resented the recent annexation of the Transvaal, did not support confederation, and would successfully rebel in the First Boer War. The various Black South African states were also suspicious of this new effort towards British expansion. The ill-advised policies of both Frere and his local ally, John Gordon Sprigg, ended up causing a string of wars across Southern Africa, culminating in the disastrous Anglo-Zulu and Boer Wars.

=== Resistance from the Cape and the Xhosa ===
The new governor was initially welcomed by the local (Molteno-Merriman) government of the Cape Colony, which was by far the largest and most powerful polity in the region.

However Frere soon encountered strong political resistance against the unpopular confederation project. In particular, the local Cape government took a non-interventionist approach towards the neighbouring Boer and Black African states of southern Africa. It was also relatively liberal in its domestic politics. Its formal response to Carnarvon&#x27;s confederation model, conveyed to London via Frere&#x27;s predecessor Sir Henry Barkly, had originally been that any federation with the illiberal Boer republics would endanger the rights and franchise of the Cape&#x27;s Black citizens, and was therefore unacceptable. The Cape government also opposed Carnarvon&#x27;s confederation plans, perceiving them as an attempt to override the Cape&#x27;s constitution and extend British imperial control over the whole of southern Africa, which as they saw it would lead to an outbreak of conflicts between the British Empire and the remaining independent states in the region, such as Zululand and the Transvaal (something the Cape government was adamantly opposed to). The summary of Molteno&#x27;s message was that &quot;the proposals for confederation should emanate from the communities to be affected, and not be pressed upon them from outside.&quot;

At the time, the subcontinent was being afflicted by the worst drought in its recorded history and, as the historian De Kiewiet memorably said: &quot;In South Africa, the heat of drought easily becomes the fever of war.&quot; It had begun in 1875, and by 1877 it was affecting the greater region. In September 1877, a minor tribal conflict erupted on the Cape frontier, between the Mfengu and Gcaleka tribes. The Cape government viewed the dispute as a local police matter, but Frere immediately traveled to the frontier and declared war on the neighbouring independent state of Gcalekaland. Frere saw the dispute as an opportunity to annex Gcalekaland for the planned confederation. Frere also expressed concerns that the continued existence of independent African states posed in his words an ever-present threat of a &quot;general and simultaneous rising of Kaffirdom against white civilization&quot;. The 9th Frontier War soon broke out.

The Transkei Xhosa were defeated and annexed early in 1878, by Lord Chelmsford and a small force of regular and colonial troops.

Frere appealed (February 1878) and received the authority from the Colonial Office to dismiss the Cape&#x27;s elected government. He then asked his political ally, John Gordon Sprigg, to form a puppet ministry. This unprecedented move solved his constitutional hindrances in the Cape, but was overshadowed by a growing set of conflicts across Southern Africa and Lord Carnarvon&#x27;s resignation in early 1878.

=== Outbreak of Zulu and Boer Wars ===

The Zulu Kingdom under King Cetshwayo remained independent of British control but Frere impressed upon the Colonial Office his opinion that if confederation was to succeed, Cetshwayo&#x27;s forces had to be eliminated and Zululand annexed. While Carnarvon remained as Colonial Secretary in London the view had support but his replacement, Sir Michael Hicks-Beach strongly wished to avoid any war in southern Africa. Frere nonetheless used the delay in mail between London and Cape Town, to time his letters so as to circumvent the Colonial Office&#x27;s opposition to war. Frere then sent Cetshwayo an impossible ultimatum in December 1878, effectively declaring war.

Cetshwayo was unable to comply with Frere&#x27;s ultimatum – even if he had wanted to; Frere ordered Lord Chelmsford to invade Zululand, and so the Anglo-Zulu War began. On 11 January 1879, British troops crossed the Tugela River; fourteen days later the disaster of Isandlwana was reported, and that was enough for the House of Commons to demand that Frere be recalled. Beaconsfield supported him, however, and in a strange compromise he was censured but asked to stay on. Frere had severely underestimated the Zulus, whom he had characterized as &quot;a bunch of savages armed with sticks.&quot;

The Zulu trouble, and disaffection brewing in the Transvaal, reacted upon each other most disastrously. The delay in giving the country a constitution afforded a pretext for agitation to the resentful Boers, a rapidly increasing minority, while the defeat at Isandlwana had badly tarnished the reputation of the British Empire in the region. Owing to the Xhosa and Zulu wars, Sir Bartle had been unable to give his undivided attention to the state of things in the Transvaal until April 1879, when he was at last able to visit a camp of about 4,000 disaffected Boers near Pretoria. Though conditions were grim, Frere managed to win the Boers&#x27; respect by promising to present their complaints to the British government, and to urge the fulfilment of the promises that had been made to them. The Boers did eventually disperse, on the very day upon which Frere received the telegram announcing the government&#x27;s censure. On his return to Cape Town, he found that his achievement had been eclipsed—first by 1 June 1879 death of Napoleon Eugene, Prince Imperial in Zululand, and then by the news that the government of the Transvaal and Natal, together with the high commissionership in the eastern part of South Africa, had been transferred from him to Sir Garnet Wolseley. Meanwhile, growing Boer resentment at Frere&#x27;s policies erupted in December 1880 into the disastrous First Boer War. The First Boer War, with the British defeats at Bronkhorstspruit, Laing&#x27;s Nek, Schuinshoogte and a decisive defeat at Majuba Hill led to the confirmation of the Boer Republics&#x27; independence and the final end of Carnarvon&#x27;s confederation scheme.

=== Outbreak of the Basotho Gun War ===
Basutoland, home of the Basotho people, had been under the nominal control of the Cape Colony since 1872. However the Cape government had allowed the Basotho leadership to keep much of their traditional authority and independence. As allies and trading partners of the Cape, the Basotho were also well-equipped with firearms.

Frere pushed &quot;The Peace Protection Act&quot; (1879), during the Xhosa Wars, and decreed that all those of African descent had to be disarmed. The Basuto Gun War (1880) followed, as the Basothos rebelled at what they saw as a racist and high-handed ruling. Premier John Gordon Sprigg&#x27;s unpopular attempt to enforce this disarmament of the Basotho was aggravated by his setting aside of Basotho land for white settlement.

The resulting war led to British defeats such as that at Qalabani, and ended in 1881 with a stalemate and a treaty that favoured the Basotho. The rebellion is a primary reason why Lesotho is now an independent country and not part of surrounding South Africa. At the same time as the Basuto Gun War broke out, unrest flared up once again among the Xhosa of the Transkei.

=== Recall ===

In 1880 Frere was recalled to London to face charges of misconduct. When Gladstone&#x27;s ministry first came into office in the spring of 1880, Lord Kimberley originally had no intention of recalling Frere. In June, however, a section of the Liberal party petitioned Gladstone to remove him, and the prime minister soon complied (1 August 1880).

The disaster of Isandlwana was compounded by the humiliating defeats of the First Boer War. He was replaced by Sir Garnet Wolseley, then charged with having acted recklessly, and censured by Whitehall.

== Death ==

Upon his return, Frere replied to the charges relating to his conduct with regard to Afghanistan as well as South Africa, previously referred to in Gladstone&#x27;s Midlothian speeches, and was preparing a fuller vindication when he died at Wimbledon on 29 May 1884. He was buried in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

== Memorials ==
Frere was the founder and first president of the Royal Society of South Africa 1877.

Frere Hall in Karachi was built in his honour. The city also named a road, street and town after him. Karachi Grammar School&#x27;s Frere House is named after him. In 1888, the Prince of Wales unveiled a statue of Frere on the Thames embankment. Mount Bartle Frere (1622m), the highest mountain in Queensland, Australia, is named after him, as is a boarding house at Haileybury. A road in Parktown, Johannesburg, is also named after him. (Frere Road was also the home of Nadine Gordimer, the Nobel Prize-winning author). In Durban, two roads honour him: Frere Road which later transforms into Bartle Road. Freretown, a district of the Kenyan city of Mombasa, is also named after him. Mount Frere (Now known as KwaBhaca) in the Eastern Cape also was named after him in the 19th century. 
The botanist, N. A. Dalzell (1864) named the plant genus &quot;Frerea&quot; to commemorate H. B. Frere. It is a monotypic plant genus known by a single species, viz. &quot;Frerea indica&quot; Dalzell. Dalzell stated &quot;Sir H. B. E. Frere, not only as a mark of esteem and respect, but also because he always has been the enlightened encourager and promoter of scientific researches in India, and is himself a close observer of nature.&quot;

A more recent work on Bartle Frere&#x27;s life, &quot;The Zulu and the Raj; The Life of Sir Bartle Frere&quot; by D. P. O&#x27;Connor, examines details of Frere&#x27;s life and motives more fully than was permissible in Victorian times when Martineau was writing. In particular, O&#x27;Connor points to Frere as a leading thinker on imperial defence. He sets the Zulu war in the context of the overall global crisis, contingent on the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), which was widely expected to result in war between Britain and Russia. Frere was sent to South Africa to turn this vital area into a secure bastion on the route to India, but was distracted from the task by the routine instability of the South African theatre.

== Popular culture ==

Frere was played by Sir John Mills in &quot;Zulu Dawn&quot;. His portrayal in the film is negative.

<text>Girl Scout Cookies are cookies sold by Girl Scouts in the United States to raise funds to support Girl Scout councils and individual troops. The cookies are widely popular and are commonly sold by going door-to-door, online, through school or town fundraisers, or at &quot;cookie booths&quot; set up at storefronts. The program is intended to both raise money and improve the financial literacy of girls. During an average selling season (usually January through April), more than one million girls sell over 200 million packages of cookies and raise over $800 million. The first known sale of cookies by Girl Scouts was in 1917. Cookie sales are organized by 112 regional Girl Scout councils who select one of two national bakeries to buy cookies from. 

The bakery selected determines which cookie varieties are available, when girls can begin selling cookies in their area, and cookie price. The bakery is paid about 25 to 35 percent of the profits; 45 to 65 percent is used by the regional council to cover programming costs; and 10 to 20 percent is kept by the local troop whose members decide how to spend their portion of the funds. A regional council receives up to 60 percent of its budget from cookie sales.

==History==

The first known cookie sales by an individual Girl Scout unit were by the Mistletoe Troop in Muskogee, Oklahoma, in December 1917 at their local high school. In 1922, the Girl Scout magazine &quot;The American Girl&quot; suggested cookie sales as a fundraiser and provided a simple sugar cookie recipe from a regional director for the Girl Scouts of Chicago. In 1928, the Girl Scout manual suggested sales of cookies to make a troop self-supporting. In 1933, Girl Scouts in Philadelphia organized the first commercial sale, selling homemade cookies at the windows of the Philadelphia Gas and Electric Company (PGE). In 1934, the first official cookie sale was by the Girl Scout Council, in Philadelphia, contracting with a commercial bakery.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/1981/girl-scout-cookie&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; From 1933 to 1935, organized cookie sales rose, with troops in Philadelphia and New York City using the cookie-selling model to develop the marketing and sales skills of their local troops. In 1936, Girl Scouts of the USA began licensing commercial bakers to produce cookies, in order to increase availability and reduce lead time, starting with Keebler-Weyl Bakery. Southern Biscuit Company and Burry Biscuit, both later acquired by the Interbake Foods division of George Weston Limited, were added in 1937. One hundred twenty five troops launched cookie sales that first year.

During World War II the Girl Scouts sold calendars in addition to cookies, because of shortages of flour, sugar, and butter. In 1943 there were 48 cookies per box. By 1943 Girl Scouts also collected fat in cans to aid the war effort and sold war bonds at no profit. In the 1950s, three more cookie recipes were added: &quot;Shortbreads&quot;/&quot;Scot-Teas&quot;, &quot;Savannahs&quot; (today called &quot;Peanut Butter Sandwich&quot; in the west of the US or “Do-si-dos” in the east of the US), and &quot;Thin Mints&quot;. Six types of cookies were being sold nationwide by 1956. Greater cookie sales occurred due to the Baby Boomer generation entering Girl Scouts in the 1960s. &quot;Samoas&quot; were added in the 1970s. In 1978, the National Council reduced the number of bakeries providing cookies to four and standardized the packaging and pricing of the cookies.

In the 1990s, the National Council limited the bakeries providing cookies to just ABC Bakers (a division of Interbake Foods) and Little Brownie Bakers (a division of the Keebler Company). In 1998, cookie sale awards were instituted. 

The Girl Scouts moved to eliminate trans fat from its cookies in 2005, and started providing nutritional information on the cookie box.

In January 2015, Girl Scouts began to offer customers the ability to purchase cookies using an online portal through a mobile app called &quot;Digital Cookie&quot;. The app can only be used by Girl Scouts themselves with parent supervision, and Girl Scouts can share an individual link to their online cookie business with friends and family only. In January 2018, both the number of cookies in a box, and, in some cases, the size of a cookie, was reduced, due to rising costs of ingredients, and rising transportation costs.

In June 2021, about 15 million boxes of cookies remained unsold, due to onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to normal sales of about 200 million boxes.

==Sales==
=== Program ===
Girl Scouts sell cookies to relatives, friends, neighbors, and others in their town or city. Some councils offer the option for customers to sponsor boxes of cookies sent to U.S. servicemen and women. The Girl Scout organization asks that members adhere to strict safety guidelines, including the cookie sale. For example, Girl Scouts, depending on their age, must be accompanied or supervised by an adult when selling Girl Scout Cookies and must always use the buddy system. As of 2015, Girl Scouts can also sell cookies online through the Digital Cookie mobile app. Each Girl Scout council decides which licensed baking company to use for cookie sales in that council, thus determining which varieties are available in the area covered by the council. 

=== Benefits and incentives ===
According to the GSUSA, the program is the largest girl-run and girl-led financial literacy program in the world, teaching girls skills like goal setting, decision making, money management, people skills, and business ethics. These skills are reinforced with Girl Scout badges, such as &quot;Cookie CEO&quot;. 

As an incentive to sell, Girl Scouts are offered recognitions and rewards, such as stuffed animals, trinkets, coupons, or credits toward Girl Scout camp, activities, or uniforms. These recognitions and rewards vary from Girl Scout council to council. The rewards are usually cumulative, so that a girl who earns the reward for selling 50 boxes of cookies will also get the 25- and 20-box items. In some councils, girls may choose to earn more money for their troop instead of recognitions if they are working toward a troop goal such as a trip or other expensive activity. This type of fundraising is intended to teach Girl Scouts valuable entrepreneurial skills such as planning, teamwork, financial literacy, organization, communication, and goal setting.

Award badges also exist for sales, including Count It Up, Talk It Up, Meet My Customers, Give Back, Cookie CEO, Customer Insights, Think Big, Business Plan, Marketing, My Portfolio, P&amp;L, Customer Loyalty and Research and Development.

=== Individual accomplishments ===
Elizabeth Brinton, also known as the &quot;Cookie Queen&quot;, sold a record 18,000 boxes of cookies in 1985, and more than 100,000 boxes in her time as a girl scout. She is known for selling cookies to sitting president Ronald Reagan. Her record held for more than twenty-nine years, until Katie Francis, 12, sold 18,107 boxes in 2014. In 2017, Charlotte McCourt, a girl scout from New Jersey, sold over 25,000 boxes of cookies, breaking the record. In 2021, Lilly Bumpus, a childhood cancer survivor, broke the record by selling 32,484 boxes.

==Profits==
The Girl Scouts say their sale of cookies is the largest annual fundraiser in the world dedicated to girls.

Traditionally each regional Girl Scout council set the prices for cookies sold in that council. A 2006 article in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; noted that price &quot;is hardly ever a factor, until buyers find out that the same box of cookies is selling for less in the next town over.&quot; The &quot;Globe&quot; found that a box of Thin Mints sold for $3.50 in Rockland, Massachusetts, and $4.00 in neighboring Norwell.

Each Girl Scout council operates its own cookie sale. Approximately 70% of the proceeds stay in the local Girl Scout council to support Girl Scouting in that area, including a portion, approximately 15%, that goes directly to the group selling the cookies. The profits are divided by a formula, with local troops receiving about 10–15% of the retail price, the council more than 50%, and the manufacturer the remainder. In 1992, Girl Scouts sold 175 million boxes of cookies nationwide. As of 2018, more than 200 million boxes are sold each cookie selling season for $800 million, leaving approximately $600 million in net revenue to the Girl Scouts to be distributed. Revenues at all levels are used to pay for events and activities for the Girl Scouts, maintenance of the councils&#x27; Girl Scout camps and other properties, cookie sale incentives, and Council administrative costs.

==Production==
Girl Scout cookies are made by large national commercial bakeries under license from Girl Scouts of the USA. The bakers licensed by the organization may change from year to year, though this is not common. In 2008 the licensed companies were Little Brownie Bakers (LBB), a subsidiary of Keebler, which is owned by Ferrero SpA; and ABC Bakers, a subsidiary of Interbake Foods, which is owned by George Weston Limited. In 2023, the same two companies were producing all Girl Scout cookies. 

===Varieties===
Up to 12 varieties of Girl Scout cookies are offered. The same cookies may be sold under different names by different bakeries, with the choice of bakery determining the name. There has been no move to standardize names. The merger of many councils (from 312 to 109) following the August 2006 reorganization resulted in many councils changing bakeries, thus causing some confusion at that time.
Thin Mints are the most popular Girl Scout Cookies. About 50 million boxes of Thin Mints were sold in 2013. Thin Mints average at about 32 cookies per box.
Samoas/Caramel deLites are the second most popular Girl Scout Cookies. About 38 million boxes of Samoas were sold in 2013. Samoas contain about 15 cookies per box.

===Nutrition===
Federal guidelines issued in early 2005 called for people to minimize their consumption of trans fat. Concerned parents urged the Girl Scouts to address this and other health concerns about the cookies, suggesting that the cookie program was at odds with the Girl Scouts&#x27; healthy living initiative. The Girl Scout organization replied that the cookies were a treat which &quot;shouldn&#x27;t be a big part of somebody&#x27;s diet&quot;, and said that they are &quot;encouraging&quot; the companies that bake the cookies to find alternative oils.

In 2007, following reformulation of the recipes for a number of varieties, Girl Scouts of the USA announced that all their cookies had less than 0.5 grams of trans fat per serving, allowing them to meet the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements for &quot;zero trans fat&quot; labeling.

High-fructose corn syrup is not used in any of the cookies.

===Palm oil===
In September 2011, GSUSA released a new policy on palm oil in Girl Scout cookies to take effect from the 2012–13 cookie season. Amongst the pledges made, GSUSA announced it would purchase GreenPalm certificates to support the sustainable production of palm oil. The certificates offer a premium price to palm oil producers who are operating within the guidelines for social and environmental responsibility set by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil.

The 2011 policy was formed in response to a prolonged campaign by two Girl Scouts, Madison Vorva and Rhiannon Tomtishen. In 2007, as 11-year-olds, Vorva and Tomtishen earned their Girl Scout Bronze Award by raising awareness of the endangered orangutan and their rapidly diminishing rainforest habitat in Indonesia and Malaysia. When they discovered that the Girl Scout Cookies contained palm oil, an ingredient whose production results in rainforest destruction and human rights abuses, the two girls launched a variety of campaigns in order to convince GSUSA to remove this ingredient from their cookies. Vorva and Tomtishen were awarded the UN Forest Heroes Award in 2011.

<doc id="329184" wikidata="Q2170645" url="?curid=329184" title="Tharsis">
<text>Tharsis () is a vast volcanic plateau centered near the equator in the western hemisphere of Mars. The region is home to the largest volcanoes in the Solar System, including the three enormous shield volcanoes Arsia Mons, Pavonis Mons, and Ascraeus Mons, which are collectively known as the Tharsis Montes. The tallest volcano on the planet, Olympus Mons, is often associated with the Tharsis region but is actually located off the western edge of the plateau. The name Tharsis is the Greco-Latin transliteration of the biblical Tarshish, the land at the western extremity of the known world.

==Location and size==

Tharsis can have many meanings depending on historical and scientific context. The name is commonly used in a broad sense to represent a continent-sized region of anomalously elevated terrain centered just south of the equator around longitude 265°E. Called the Tharsis bulge or Tharsis rise, this broad, elevated region dominates the western hemisphere of Mars and is the largest topographic feature on the planet, after the global dichotomy.

Tharsis has no formally defined boundaries, so precise dimensions for the region are difficult to give. In general, the bulge is about across and up to high (excluding the volcanoes, which have much higher elevations). It roughly extends from Amazonis Planitia (215°E) in the west to Chryse Planitia (300°E) in the east. The bulge is slightly elongated in the north-south direction, running from the northern flanks of Alba Mons (about 55°N) to the southern base of the Thaumasia highlands (about 43°S). Depending on how the region is defined, Tharsis covers , or up to 25% of Mars’ surface area.

===Subprovinces===
The greater Tharsis region consists of several geologically distinct subprovinces with different ages and volcano-tectonic histories. The subdivisions given here are informal and may rise all or parts of other formally named physiographic features and regions.

Tharsis is divided into two broad rises: a northern and a larger southern rise. The northern rise partially overlies sparsely cratered, lowland plains north of the dichotomy boundary. This region is dominated by Alba Mons and its extensive volcanic flows. Alba Mons is a vast, low-lying volcanic construct that is unique to Mars. Alba Mons is so large and topographically distinct that it can almost be treated as an entire volcanic province unto itself. The oldest part of the northern rise consists of a broad topographic ridge that corresponds to the highly fractured terrain of Ceraunius Fossae. The ridge is oriented north-south and forms part of the Noachian-aged basement on which Alba Mons sits. Also located in the northern rise are lava flows of the Ceraunius Fossae Formation, which are somewhat older than the Amazonian-aged flows that make up much of the central Tharsis region to the south. 

The larger southern portion of Tharsis (pictured right) lies on old cratered highland terrain. Its western boundary is roughly defined by the high lava plains of Daedalia Planum, which slope gently to the southwest into the Memnonia and Terra Sirenum regions. To the east, the southern Tharsis bulge consists of the Thaumasia Plateau, an extensive stretch of volcanic plains about 3,000 km wide. The Thaumasia Plateau is bounded to the west by a highly elevated zone of fractures (Claritas Fossae) and mountains (the Thaumasia Highlands) that curves south then east to northeast in a wide arc that has been compared to the shape of a scorpion’s tail. The plateau province is bounded to the north by Noctis Labyrinthus and the western three-quarters of Valles Marineris. It is bounded to the east by a north-south oriented ridge called the Coprates rise. These boundaries enclose a broad high plateau and shallow interior basin that include Syria, Sinai, and Solis Plana (see list of plains on Mars). The highest plateau elevations on the Tharsis bulge occur in northern Syria Planum, western Noctis Labyrinthus, and the plains east of Arsia Mons.

Between the northern and southern portions of the Tharsis bulge lies a relatively narrow, northeast-trending region that may be considered Tharsis proper or central Tharsis. It is defined by the three massive Tharsis Montes volcanoes (Arsia Mons, Pavonis Mons, and Ascraeus Mons), a number of smaller volcanic edifices, and adjacent plains consisting of young (mid to late Amazonian) lava flows. The lava plains slope gently to the east where they overlap and embay the older (Hesperian-aged) terrain of Echus Chasma and western Tempe Terra. To the west, the lava plains slope toward a system of immense northwest-oriented valleys up to wide. These northwestern slope valleys (NSVs) - which debouch into Amazonis Planitia - are separated by a parallel set of gigantic &quot;keel-shaped&quot; promontories. The NSVs may be relics from catastrophic floods of water, similar to the huge outflow channels that empty into Chryse Planitia, east of Tharsis. Central Tharsis is approximately long and includes most of the region covered by the Tharsis quadrangle and the northwestern portion of the adjoining Phoenicis Lacus quadrangle to the south.

Olympus Mons and its associated lava flows and aureole deposits form another distinct subprovince of the Tharsis region. This subregion is about across. It lies off the main topographic bulge, but is related to the volcanic processes that formed Tharsis. Olympus Mons is the youngest of the large Tharsis volcanoes.

==Geology==
Tharsis is commonly called a volcano-tectonic province, meaning that it is the product of volcanism and associated tectonic processes that have caused extensive crustal deformation. According to the standard view, Tharsis overlies a hot spot, similar to the one thought to underlie the island of Hawaii. The hot spot is caused by one or more massive columns of hot, low-density material (a superplume) rising through the mantle. The hot spot produces voluminous quantities of magma in the lower crust that is released to the surface as highly fluid, basaltic lava. Because Mars lacks plate tectonics, the lava is able to build up in one region for billions of years to produce enormous volcanic constructs.

On Earth (and presumably Mars as well), not all of the magma produced in a large igneous province erupts at the surface as lava. Much of it stalls in the crust where it slowly cools and solidifies to produce large intrusive complexes (plutons). If the magma migrates through vertical fractures it produces swarms of dikes that may be expressed at the surface as long, linear cracks (fossae) and crater chains (catenae). Magma may also intrude the crust horizontally as large tabular bodies, such as sills and laccoliths, that can cause a general doming and fracturing of the overlying crust. Thus, the bulk of Tharsis is probably made of these intrusive complexes in addition to lava flows at the surface.

One key question about the nature of Tharsis has been whether the bulge is mainly the product of active crustal uplifting from buoyancy provided by the underlying mantle plume or whether it is merely a large, static mass of igneous material supported by the underlying lithosphere. Theoretical analysis of gravity data and the pattern of faults surrounding Tharsis suggest the latter is more likely. The enormous sagging weight of Tharsis has generated tremendous stresses in the crust, producing a broad trough around the region and an array of radial fractures emanating from the center of the bulge that stretches halfway across the planet.

Geologic evidence, such as the flow direction of ancient valley networks around Tharsis, indicates that the bulge was largely in place by the end of the Noachian Period, some 3.7 billion years ago. Although the bulge itself is ancient, volcanic eruptions in the region continued throughout Martian history and probably played a significant role in the production of the planet&#x27;s atmosphere and the weathering of rocks on the planet&#x27;s surface.
By one estimate, the Tharsis bulge contains around 300 million km3 of igneous material. Assuming the magma that formed Tharsis contained carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapor in percentages comparable to that observed in Hawaiian basaltic lava, then the total amount of gases released from Tharsis magmas could have produced a 1.5-bar CO2 atmosphere and a global layer of water 120 m thick. Martian magmas also likely contain significant amounts of sulfur and chlorine. These elements combine with water to produce acids that can break down primary rocks and minerals. Exhalations from Tharsis and other volcanic centers on the planet are likely responsible for an early period of Martian time (the Theiikian) when sulfuric acid weathering produced abundant hydrated sulfate minerals such as kieserite and gypsum.

Two European Space Agency probes have discovered water frost on Tharsis. Previously, it was thought that water frost on Mars was impossible.

==True polar wander on Mars==

The total mass of the Tharsis bulge is approximately 1021 kg, about the same as the dwarf planet Ceres. Tharsis is so large and massive that it has likely affected the planet&#x27;s moment of inertia, possibly causing a change in the orientation of the planet&#x27;s crust with respect to its rotational axis over time. According to one recent study, Tharsis originally formed at about 50°N latitude and migrated toward the equator between 4.2 and 3.9 billion years ago. Such shifts, known as true polar wander, would have caused dramatic climate changes over vast areas of the planet. A more recent study reported in Nature agreed with the polar wander, but the authors thought the eruptions at Tharsis happened at a slightly different time.

==Volcanism==

Spacecraft exploration over the last two decades has shown that volcanoes on other planets can take many unexpected forms. Over the same time period, geologists were discovering that volcanoes on Earth are more structurally complex and dynamic than previously thought. Recent work has attempted to refine the definition of a volcano to incorporate geologic features of widely different shapes, sizes, and compositions throughout the Solar System. One surprising and controversial conclusion from this synthesis of ideas is that the Tharsis region may be a single giant volcano. This is the thesis of geologists Andrea Borgia and John Murray in a Geological Society of America special paper published in 2010.

The key to understanding how a vast igneous province like Tharsis can itself be a volcano is to re-think the notion of volcano from one of simple conical edifice to that of an environment or &quot;holistic&quot; system. According to the conventional view in geology, volcanoes passively build up from lava and ash erupted above fissures or rifts in the crust. The rifts are produced through regional tectonic forces operating in the crust and underlying mantle. Traditionally, the volcano and its magmatic plumbing have been studied by volcanologists and igneous petrologists, while the tectonic features are the subject for structural geologists and geophysicists. However, recent work on large terrestrial volcanoes indicates that the distinction between volcanic and tectonic processes is quite blurry, with significant interplay between the two.

Many volcanoes produce deformational structures as they grow. The flanks of volcanoes commonly exhibit shallow gravity slumps, faults and associated folds. Large volcanoes grow not only by adding erupted material to their flanks, but also by spreading laterally at their bases, particularly if they rest on weak or ductile materials. As a volcano grows in size and weight, the stress field underneath the volcano changes from compressional to extensional. A subterranean rift may develop at the base of the volcano where the crust is wrenched apart. This volcanic spreading may initiate further structural deformation in the form of thrust faults along the volcano&#x27;s distal flanks, pervasive grabens and normal faults across the edifice, and catastrophic flank failure (sector collapse). Mathematical analysis shows that volcanic spreading operates on volcanoes at a wide range of scales and is theoretically similar to the larger-scale rifting that occurs at mid-ocean ridges (divergent plate boundaries). Thus, in this view, the distinction between tectonic plate, spreading volcano, and rift is nebulous, all being part of the same geodynamic system.

According to Borgia and Murray, Mount Etna in Sicily is a good terrestrial analogue for the much larger Tharsis bulge, which to them is one immense volcano they call Tharsis Rise. Mount Etna is a complex spreading volcano that is characterized by three main structural features: a volcanic rift system that crosses the summit in a north-northeast direction; a peripheral compression belt (thrust front) surrounding the base of the volcano; and an east-northeast trending system of transtensional (oblique normal) faults that connect the summit rift to the peripheral thrust front. The volcano&#x27;s peak contains an array of steep summit cones, which are frequently active. The entire edifice is also peppered with a large number of small parasitic cones.

The structural similarities of Mount Etna to Tharsis Rise are striking, even though the latter is some 200 times larger. In Borgia and Murray&#x27;s view, Tharsis resembles a very large spreading volcano. As with Etna, the spreading has produced a rift through the summit of the rise and a system of radial tear faults that connect the rift to a basal compression belt. The tear-fault system on Tharsis is represented by the radial fossae, of which Valles Marineris is the largest example. The thrust front is visible as the Thaumasia Highlands. Unlike on Earth, where the rifting of plates produces a corresponding subduction zone, the thick lithosphere of Mars is unable to descend into the mantle. Instead, the compressed zone is scrunched up and sheared laterally into mountain ranges, in a process called obduction. To complete the analogy, the huge Olympus Mons and the Tharsis Montes are merely summit cones or parasitic cones on a much larger volcanic edifice.

It is located on the Kishu Kaido, the main route connecting the capital area of Japan with Kii Province, and its coastal location was important for transportation from the eastern Shikoku to Settsu Province and Kyoto.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Ikeda has remained relatively steady over the past 40 years.

==History==
The area of Ikeda was part of ancient Settsu Province. It was known as &quot;Kureha no Sato&quot; since ancient times, and even today, vestiges can be seen in the place names and names of shrines and temple with ancient foundations in the site. In the latter half of the Heian period, a &quot;shōen&quot; landed estate called Kurehanoshō was established, and it came to be called &quot;Ikeda&quot; around the end of the Kamakura period. Ikeda Castle, the residence of the Settsu Ikeda clan, was built during the Nanboku-chō period, but was abandoned during the Sengoku period when Araki Murashige defeated the Ikeda clan in 1574, and moved the castle to Itami. During the Edo Period, the area was largely part of the holdings of Asada Domain, and was famous for &quot;Ikeda-zumi&quot; (Ikeda charcoal) traded by Ikeda merchants. In cha no yu Ikeda-zumi is loved because of its high quality even today. 

The village of Ikeda was established with the creation of the modern municipality system on April 1, 1889. It was raised to town status on August 10, 1935. The town was developed as a commuter town by the Hankyu Railway, whose founder Kobayashi Ichizo (Itsuo) was a resident and major landowner. Ikeda was raised to city status on April 29, 1939. 

On June 8, 2001, the Ikeda school massacre occurred in this city. A man entered an elementary school and fatally stabbed eight children in the school. Many pupils have suffered post-traumatic stress disorder. To avoid flashback memories of the massacre and to improve school security, the buildings were remodeled and subsequently occupied in April 2004. On September 14, 2004, Mamoru Takuma was executed for the murders.

There are also two regional wholesale markets, the Maruike Regional Wholesale Market and the Marukita Regional Wholesale Market, located near Osaka International Airport.

<text>Thomas Raymond Flores (born March 21, 1937) is an American former professional football player in the American Football League (AFL) and coach in the National Football League (NFL). He played as a quarterback for nine seasons in the AFL, primarily with the Oakland Raiders. After his retirement as a coach, he was a radio announcer for more than twenty years.

Flores won four Super Bowls in his playing and coaching careers. He and Mike Ditka are the only two people in NFL history to win a Super Bowl as a player, assistant coach, and head coach (Flores won Super Bowl IV as a player for the Kansas City Chiefs, Super Bowl XI as an assistant coach of the Raiders, and Super Bowl XV and Super Bowl XVIII as head coach of the Raiders). Flores was also the first Mexican starting quarterback and the first minority head coach in professional football history to win a Super Bowl. Although it may not be officially sourced, Flores is also noted as the only head coach to win a Super Bowl with the same team in two cities in Oakland (1980) and Los Angeles (1983).

From 1997 until 2018, Flores served as an announcer for the Raiders Radio Network. Flores was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2021 as a head coach.

==Playing career==
Flores played quarterback for two seasons at Fresno City College, beginning in 1955. He was active off the field too, serving on the Student Council and as President of the Associated Men&#x27;s Students. He received an academic scholarship to study at the College of the Pacific—now known as the University of the Pacific—from which he graduated in 1958. Flores came to Pacific from Fresno City College and started for the Tigers as quarterback. Following his playing career with the Tigers, he was hired as an assistant coach at Pacific and worked toward his master&#x27;s degree.

Flores was unable to find a job in professional football. He was cut by the Calgary Stampeders of the CFL in 1958, after which he played with the Bakersfield Spoilers (Semi-Pro) football team. A second attempt to break into pro football with the Washington Redskins of the National Football League (NFL) in 1959 also failed. In 1960, Flores finally landed a position as a quarterback with the American Football League&#x27;s Oakland Raiders, who began play in 1960 as a charter member of the league. He was named the Raiders&#x27; starter early that season, becoming the first-ever Hispanic starting quarterback in professional football.

Flores had his most productive season in 1966, passing for 2,638 yards and 24 touchdowns in 14 games. Oakland traded him to the Buffalo Bills in 1967. After serving as Jack Kemp&#x27;s backup that year, he had a chance to be the Bills&#x27; starter when Kemp suffered a season-ending injury during training camp. However, Flores hurt his shoulder before the first game, and his season was limited to a five-pass appearance in Week 6. After another five-pass appearance in the first game of 1969, the Bills released Flores and he signed with the Kansas City Chiefs. There he was third-string quarterback behind fellow Hall of Famer Len Dawson and Mike Livingston on the Chiefs&#x27; Super Bowl Championship team. He officially retired as a player after not playing a single game in the 1970 season. He was one of only twenty players who were in the AFL for its entire ten-year existence. He is the fifth-leading passer in the AFL&#x27;s history.

==Coaching career==
Flores is a member of the Sid Gillman coaching tree. After stints as an assistant coach in Buffalo and Oakland (he won a Super Bowl XI ring as an assistant coach under John Madden), team owner Al Davis promoted Flores became the Raiders&#x27; head coach in 1979, following Madden&#x27;s retirement. In 1980, Flores led the Raiders as a wild card playoff team to win the Super Bowl XV championship over the Philadelphia Eagles, 27–10. This was the first wild card team to win the Super Bowl and the only team to win four postseason games en route to a title, until Denver accomplished the same feat in 1997. Flores then moved with the team to Los Angeles in 1982. In the 1983 season Flores led the Raiders to another Super Bowl (XVIII) victory over the Washington Redskins, 38–9. He was named AFC Coach of the year by United Press International and the Football Writers Association in 1982. Flores was the NFL&#x27;s first minority head coach to win a Super Bowl, winning twice – Super Bowl XV with the Oakland Raiders and Super Bowl XVIII with the Los Angeles Raiders. After a 5–10 finish to the 1987 season, Flores moved to the Raiders&#x27; front office but left after just one year. His 83 wins with the Raiders are the second-most in franchise history, behind only Madden. While he appreciated the time spent with the Raiders, Flores once stated that he believed his lack of induction in the Pro Football Hall of Fame was because of the &quot;dominating force&quot; cast by Davis.

On February 22, 1989, Ken Behring (a close friend of Flores) of the Seattle Seahawks hired Flores to serve as team president and general manager after not renewing Mike McCormack&#x27;s contract. After the 1991 season, head coach Chuck Knox agreed to part ways after meeting with Flores and the owner. Flores had wanted Dennis Erickson (then of the University of Miami) to be the new head coach but Erickson elected to stay with Miami. On January 6, 1992, he appointed himself head coach of the Seahawks. In the offseason, the team elected to move on from Dave Krieg as quarterback that left a roster of Kelly Stouffer, Stan Gelbaugh, and Dan McGwire. The team went from 7–9 the previous year to 2–14, complete with scoring 140 points, the lowest total by a team for an entire 16-game season in NFL history. The one bright spot was Cortez Kennedy, who won the NFL Defensive Player of the Year. The Seahawks elected to go with Rick Mirer at quarterback for 1993 that resulted in a 6–10 campaign where they lost five of their last six games.
The 1994 team started 3–1 but then lost four in a row on the way to a 6–10 finish. Five days after the season ended, on December 29, 1994, the Seahawks fired Flores and his entire staff. Flores left pro football with a lifetime coaching record of 97–87 (52.7%), as well as an 8–3 playoff record, with two Super Bowl victories.

==Post-coaching career==
From 1997 until 2018, Flores was a color commentator alongside play-by-play announcer Greg Papa for the Raiders Radio Network.

Flores served as coach of the American team in the 2011 NFLPA Collegiate Bowl.

==Personal life==
In 1961 Flores married Barbara Fridell, who he met while a student at University of the Pacific. They have twin sons and a daughter, and five grandchildren and one great nephew Adelso Flores. 

Sanger High School&#x27;s football stadium is named Tom Flores Stadium in honor of Flores, who was a graduate of Sanger. He heads the Tom Flores Youth Foundation, which benefits the K-8th grades in the Sanger School district in the fields of art, science, and sports.

Flores graduated from University of the Pacific in 1958. He was the starting quarterback while at Pacific and following his playing career with the Tigers, Flores was hired as an assistant coach at Pacific as he worked toward his master&#x27;s degree.

Flores holds an honorary doctorate degree from Pepperdine University for humanitarian service.

His biography, &quot;Fire in the Iceman&quot;, was released in 1992. Flores also coauthored &quot;Tales of the Oakland Raiders&quot; (2002).

==Head coaching record==
== Awards and honors ==
In 1982, Flores was inducted as a charter member of the University of the Pacific Athletics Hall of Fame. In 1988, he was inducted into the Fresno County Athletic Hall of Fame. In 2007, Flores was inducted into the California Sports Hall of Fame. In 2011, he was also inducted into the California Community College Athletic Association Hall of Fame. In July 2011, Flores received the Roberto Clemente Award for Sports Excellence that is given by the National Council of La Raza for contributions in society by an Hispanic athlete. In 2012, he was also inducted into the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame.
In 2021, Flores was enshrined into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, alongside former Raider Charles Woodson, Peyton Manning and five others.

<doc id="329193" wikidata="Q6395263" url="?curid=329193" title="Keswick, Ontario">
<text>Keswick () is a community located in the Canadian province of Ontario. Situated in Cook&#x27;s Bay on Lake Simcoe, north of Toronto. Keswick is part of the Township of Georgina, the northernmost municipality in the Regional Municipality of York. In the Canada 2016 Census, the municipal population of Keswick was 26,757.

Roches Point () is a small residential community on the shore of Lake Simcoe in Keswick.

==History==
Keswick was originally known as Medina, founded by Chris Armstrong. It was a part of the Township of North Gwillimbury before becoming part of the Township of Georgina. It may have been renamed after Keswick, Cumbria in England. The area was formerly considered part of &quot;cottage country&quot; for those who lived in Toronto up until the late 1980s, when major development further opened up access to Keswick, expanding its population.

Since the completion of the extension of Highway 404 into the region, the Simcoe Landing community has resumed construction. In 2017 the development started construction on Phase 9 overtop of existing farmers fields. The completed community will span from Ravenshoe Rd to Glenwoods Ave, The Queensway South to Woodbine Ave. Future plans indicate an additional elementary and secondary school to be located in this area as well as parks and green space.

Roches Point was named after the Irish settler James O&#x27;Dell Roch, who obtained land in the area sometime before 1812 and sold it after being forced to retreat during the War of 1812. It became Government Reserves by 1822, and the name disappeared within the new community of Keswick, beginning in 1824. After the War of 1812 the Roches Point area was considered as a possible alternative capital to replace York (now Toronto), as it was farther from American encroachment.

==Geography==
Keswick&#x27;s geographical coordinates are 44.22°N, 79.45°W, and its elevation above sea level is 221m/762 ft. It has a geographical area of 16.25 km2 according to Statistics Canada. It is bound on the north by Roches Point, the east by Woodbine Avenue, the south by East Gwillimbury (Ravenshoe Road) and the west by Cook&#x27;s Bay, part of Lake Simcoe. Included in Keswick is the Keswick Marsh, part of the Holland Marsh. Having been built mainly as a cottage community, Keswick is fairly long north-to-south as it hugs the shore of Lake Simcoe. The Maskinonge River weaves through Keswick, across both of its main streets, The Queensway South and Woodbine Avenue.

===Beechcroft and Lakehurst Gardens===

Beechcroft and Lakehurst Gardens National Historic site consists of two properties along the shoreline of Lake Simcoe.

The Beechcroft property was an estate on 97 acres that had been owned by Captain Issac May around the 1860s. The English-landscape-inspired grounds were laid out for the owner Anson Greene Phelps Dodge, an American-Canadian lumber baron and short-lived Member of Parliament, around 1870 and are believed to have been designed or influenced by Frederick Law Olmsted. Unlike Beechcroft, Lakehurst Gardens was a formal horticultural garden.

Although designated historical, the grounds are privately owned, with no public access.

<text>Comerica Park is a baseball stadium located in Downtown Detroit. It has been the ballpark of Major League Baseball&#x27;s Detroit Tigers since 2000, when the team left Tiger Stadium.

==History==
===Construction===

Founded in 1894, the Tigers had played at the corner of Michigan and Trumbull Avenues in Detroit&#x27;s Corktown neighborhood since 1896, when Bennett Park opened. In 1911, new Tigers owner Frank Navin ordered the construction of a new ballpark to be built on the same site. Opening in 1912, the ballpark, which eventually became known as Tiger Stadium, served as the Tigers&#x27; home for the next 88 seasons. By the mid-1990s, it had become apparent that the much-beloved ballpark was at the end of its useful life.

Comerica Park sits on the original site of the Detroit College of Law. Groundbreaking for the new stadium was held on October 29, 1997. At the time of construction, the scoreboard in left field was the largest in Major League Baseball. It was part of a downtown revitalization plan for the city of Detroit, which included the construction of Ford Field, adjacent to the ballpark. The first game was held on April 11, 2000, against the Seattle Mariners.

===First game===
The first game at Comerica Park was held on Tuesday, April 11, 2000, with 39,168 spectators attending, on a cold snowy afternoon. The temperature that afternoon was . The Tigers beat the Seattle Mariners 5–2. The winning pitcher, as in the final game at Tiger Stadium, was Brian Moehler.

===Naming rights===
In December 1998, Comerica Bank agreed to pay $66 million over 30 years for the naming rights for the new ballpark. In 2018, Comerica extended its naming rights agreement with the Tigers through 2034.

==Features==
The main entrance to the ballpark is located across the street from the Fox Theatre and between two historic downtown churches, St. John Episcopal Church and Central United Methodist Church. Outside the main entrance is a tiger statue that is in height. There are 8 other heroic-sized tiger statues throughout the park, including two prowling on top of the scoreboard in left field. These tigers&#x27; eyes light up after a Tigers home run or a victory and the sound of a growling tiger plays as well. The tigers were originally created by sculptor Michael Keropian and fabricated by ShowMotion Inc. in Norwalk, Connecticut. Along the brick walls outside the park are 33 tiger heads with lighted baseballs in their mouths.

At the left-center field concourse there are statues of almost all of the players whose numbers have been retired by the Tigers (with the exception of Jackie Robinson, whose number was retired in every MLB park in 1997 and is located on the wall in right-center field). A statue of Ty Cobb is also there, but he does not have a number, as he played baseball before players began to wear numbers on their uniforms. These players&#x27; names, along with the names of Hall of Fame players and broadcasters who spent a significant part of their career with the Tigers, are also on a wall in right-center field. Ernie Harwell, the team&#x27;s long time radio announcer and a recipient of the Hall of Fame&#x27;s Ford C. Frick Award, has a statue just inside the stadium on the first base side.

Comerica Park is currently the only ballpark in MLB to feature a distinctive dirt strip between home plate and the pitcher&#x27;s mound. This strip, sometimes known as the &quot;keyhole&quot;, was common in early ballparks, but it is very rare in modern facilities. Additionally, the home plate area is in the shape of the home plate itself, and not as a standard circle.

In the northeastern corner of the stadium behind the stands from the third base line is a Ferris wheel with twelve cars designed like baseballs. In the northwestern corner of the stadium behind the stands from the first base line is a carousel.

The flagpole located between center and left fields was originally in play, as was the flagpole in Tiger Stadium. However, the left field wall was moved in front of the pole before the 2003 season. A ball that hits the pole is now ruled a home run. The right field of the stadium features the Pepsi Porch, a picnic deck between the 100 and 200 level seating bowls. Also in right field, and part of the 100 level seating bowl, is an area of seats known as &quot;Kaline&#x27;s Corner&quot;, an homage to Hall of Fame right fielder Al Kaline, who once played for the Tigers when the team played in Tiger Stadium.

An LED scoreboard was added to the right-center field wall, and the upper deck fascia for the 2007 season.
A giant fountain is located behind center field. General Motors sponsored the fountain from 2000 to 2008, and used the area to showcase GM manufactured vehicles as well. While GM dropped its sponsorship for the 2009 season due to financial issues, the GM branding was not removed from the fountain. Instead, signs for Chrysler and Ford were also added to the display, along with the message &quot;The Detroit Tigers support our automakers.&quot; In 2010, GM returned to sponsoring the display, now known as the Chevrolet Fountain.

A completely redesigned and upgraded left field video display debuted for the 2012 season. The serif &quot;TIGERS&quot; wordmark was removed and replaced by cursive lettering that can also display graphics and video. An analog clock below the Tigers wordmark and above the Comerica Park logo was also removed. An HD LED display was installed, which was much larger than the three displays that had been there for years. The previous scoreboard used light bulbs – still a popular scoreboard technology around the time the park opened, though they were quickly aging as LED displays became available and were installed around other Major League ballparks. The scoreboard was also raised in an effort to address complaints that the scoreboard was too far left and thus obstructed by the left field upper deck. Along with the replacement scoreboard, all remaining bulb fascia scoreboards were also upgraded to LED.

In 2014, the Tigers announced a $4 million renovation to Comerica Park&#x27;s Pepsi Porch. This renovation included the removal of the bleachers that once occupied the space and the addition of new stadium seats. The plan also included new high top tables, a new bar in the middle of the porch, couches and lounge chairs, as well as a fire pit. The bleachers that once occupied the area were moved to the space above The Jungle restaurant and bar.

There is a fireworks show after Friday evening games usually starting after Memorial Day.

==Dimensions==
In contrast to Tiger Stadium, which had long been considered one of the most hitter-friendly parks in baseball, Comerica Park is considered to be extremely friendly to pitchers. Except for dead center field, the outfield dimensions were more expansive than those at Tiger Stadium. This led to complaints from players and fans alike. Most famously, Bobby Higginson sarcastically referred to the venue as &quot;Comerica National Park&quot;.

Before the start of the 2003 MLB season, the club moved the distance from left-center field from . This also removed the flagpole from the field of play, originally incorporated as an homage to Tiger Stadium. Two years later, the bullpens were moved from right field to an empty area in left field created when the fence was moved in. In place of the old bullpens in right field, about 950 seats were added. This made one of the most pitcher-friendly ballparks transform into the third most batter-friendly (with extra bases also taken into account).

Prior to the 2023 MLB season, the club announced that the center field fence would be moved in 10 feet, measuring at , while left field would be relabeled at . This was due to the actual distances from home plate being revealed via laser measurements. The club also announced that the center field, right-center field, and right field fences would be lowered to 7 feet.

In the layout of the playing field at Comerica Park, when a player is at bat, the direction he is facing looks farther to the south than at any other ballpark.

==Transportation==
Public transportation for the park is available via the Detroit People Mover station at Grand Circus Park and the QLine at the Montcalm Street station, in addition to SMART, which runs regional routes from the suburbs, and DDOT.

==Stadium use==
===Baseball===
In 2005, Comerica Park hosted the 76th MLB All-Star Game, the first to be played in Detroit since 1971. In the Home Run Derby, held the day before, Bobby Abreu hit 24 home runs in the first round, breaking the previous record of 15. Abreu won the Derby over Tigers catcher Iván Rodríguez, hitting a then record 41 homers during the event. In the All-Star Game, the American League won 7–5 with Miguel Tejada winning the game&#x27;s MVP Award.

The first playoff game at Comerica Park was played on October 6, 2006, against the New York Yankees. On October 21, 2006, Comerica Park hosted the first World Series game in the history of the ballpark (Game 1 of the 2006 World Series).

In 2008, the Tiger statue at the main entrance of the ballpark was dressed with a Detroit Red Wings jersey as the Red Wings were playing against the Pittsburgh Penguins in the Stanley Cup Finals. The jersey is usually worn by the Spirit of Detroit, but it was undergoing restoration during that time.

On August 15, 2011, Minnesota Twins slugger Jim Thome became the eighth player in baseball history to hit 600 career home runs.

Comerica Park hosted its second World Series in 2012, with the Tigers getting swept by the San Francisco Giants.

On April 23, 2022, Tigers slugger Miguel Cabrera became the 33rd player in Major League history to get his 3,000th hit with a single in the first inning off of Colorado Rockies pitcher Antonio Senzatela.

Only two no-hitters have been thrown at Comerica Park, both by the Tigers. On June 12, 2007, the first no-hitter was thrown at Comerica Park by Justin Verlander. The Tigers won the game 4–0 against the Milwaukee Brewers. It was also the first no-hitter thrown by a Tiger in the city of Detroit since Virgil Trucks accomplished the feat in 1952. Then on July 8, 2023, Matt Manning, Jason Foley and Alex Lange threw a combined no-hitter in a 2–0 victory against the Toronto Blue Jays.

Comerica Park also played host to a near-perfect game by Armando Galarraga against the Cleveland Indians on June 2, 2010. Galarraga retired the first 26 batters he faced, but was denied both a perfect game and no-hitter when umpire Jim Joyce erroneously awarded Indians batter Jason Donald an infield single with two outs in the ninth inning.

===Concerts===
===Hockeytown Winter Festival===

On February 9, 2012, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman announced that Comerica Park would host the Hockeytown Winter Festival in concert with the 2013 NHL Winter Classic held at Michigan Stadium. The festival was to include events such as games between teams in the Ontario Hockey League, the American Hockey League, the Great Lakes Invitational, youth hockey games, and the NHL alumni game. Due to the 2012–13 NHL lockout, the festival was cancelled. The festival was rescheduled for December 2013. An outdoor rink was set up on the infield of the ballpark for public skating and hockey games.

===Soccer===
On July 19, 2017, Comerica Park hosted its first ever soccer game between Roma of the Italian Serie A League against Paris Saint-Germain of France&#x27;s Ligue 1 in the 2017 International Champions Cup tournament.

On July 30, 2023, Crystal Palace of the English Premier League and Sevilla of Spain&#x27;s La Liga played against each other at Comerica Park.

<text>The Little Missouri River, or &quot;Little Mo&quot;, is a waterway that runs from the Ouachita Mountains of southwest Arkansas into the rolling hills area in the surrounding countryside.

== Overview ==
The Little Missouri River is a rocky mountain river that flows through narrow forested canyons. This river has numerous small waterfalls, crystal clear water, and outstanding scenery including towering rocky bluffs crowned with pine.

The Little Missouri River was so named because its lower reaches were said to remind early French explorers of the Missouri River.

==Location==
;Mouth: Confluence with the Ouachita River in Ouachita County, Arkansas 
;Source: Mountains of Polk County, Arkansas 

== Course ==
The Little Missouri flows in a generally north-to-south direction through Pike, Clark, and Montgomery on the western side of the Ouachita River. The Little Missouri River is south of, and runs parallel to, the Caddo River, before flowing into the Ouachita River near Tates Bluff, Arkansas. The largest tributary of the Little Missouri River is the Antoine River. The Little Missouri River is intermittently navigable to small boats below its confluence with the Antoine River, although it is rarely used.

The Little Missouri River is dammed by Narrows Dam and forms Lake Greeson. The upper stretches of the Little Missouri River above Lake Greeson descend 1,035 feet in 29 miles (315 m in 47 km) for an average drop of . This makes the upper waters of the river excellent for experienced canoers. There is a long segment that has been designated as a wild river. This segment contains the &quot;Winding Stair Rapid&quot;, which is classified as a Class IV rapid on the International Scale of River Difficulty. Another attraction on the upper river is Little Missouri Falls, a staircasestep fall that attracts photographers and visitors. The upper reaches of the Little Missouri were considered so scenic that the area was once approved by Congress to become Ouachita National Park, until this action was vetoed by President Herbert Hoover. The watershed of the Little Missouri River is quite small, which means that its upper reaches ordinarily contain little water during the dry summer months.

The Little Missouri River is a superior fishing stream for rainbow trout, green sunfish, longear sunfish, smallmouth bass, spotted bass, and other species. The area below the dam at Lake Greeson is most popular for trout fishermen.

Portions of the Little Missouri River flow through the Ouachita National Forest, and the lower segment flows past the Crater of Diamonds State Park. The Albert Pike Campground provides camping facilities for visitors to the area.

The Little Missouri is listed as a &quot;Wild and Scenic River&quot; by the United States Forest Service. The upper reaches of the river are designated as an &quot;Arkansas Natural and Scenic River&quot; by the State.

== History ==
The Little Missouri flows through territory once occupied by the mound-building Caddo people.

During the American Civil War the Battle of Elkin&#x27;s Ferry was fought on the Little Missouri, north of Prescott, Arkansas, at the Clark-Nevada County line.
During the night of June 10–11, 2010 a flash flood along Little Missouri killed 20 people including 8 children who were camping in the campgrounds of the Albert Pike Recreational Area. Between 200 and 300 campers had woken to rapidly rising water, and in less than four hours, water rose from to over

During the Muromachi period, the area was a stronghold of the Ikkō-ikki movement, and in the Sengoku period was under the control of the warlords Miyoshi Nagayoshi and Takayama Ukon. During the Edo Period, Takatsuki Domain changed hands between several &quot;fudai daimyō&quot; clans and a &quot;jōkamachi&quot; developed around Takatsuki Castle. Takatsuki Village was established within Shimakami District, Osaka with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889, and elevated to town status on October 14, 1898. Takatsuki grew by annexing neighboring villages in the 1930s, and was elevated to city status on January 1, 1943. Takatsuki annexed the village of Abuno in 1448, Goryo in 1950, Sankamaki in 1955, Tomita in 1956 and the village of Kashida from Minamikuwata District, Kyoto in 1958. On April 1, 2003, Takatsuki was designated a Core city with increased local autonomy.

===Demographics===
Per Japanese census data, the population of Hirakata rose rapidly in the 1960s and 1970s, and less rapidly since.

Eriko Aoki, author of &quot;Korean children, textbooks, and educational practices in Japanese primary schools,&quot; stated that the city&#x27;s location in proximity to both Osaka City and Kyoto contributed to its population growth of ten times its previous size from around 1973 to 2013.

====Ethnic Koreans====
As of 2013 the city has about 2,000 ethnic Koreans. Most Hirakata Koreans, including children of school age, use Japanese names. Many Koreans in Hirakata operate their own businesses. Hirakata has the &quot;mother&#x27;s society&quot; or &quot;Omoni no Kai&quot;, a voluntary association of ethnic Korean mothers.

There were about 3,000 ethnic Koreans in Hirakata in the pre-World War II period. In the 1930s Hirakata Koreans, fearful of keeping their own jobs, had negative attitudes towards Osaka-based Koreans who were looking for employment after having lost their jobs. Military construction was the most common job sector of that era&#x27;s Korean population. Eriko Aoki stated that in 2013 there was still a sense of difference between the Koreans in Hirakata and the Koreans in Osaka.

==History==
The area of the modern city of Hirakata was within ancient Kawachi Province. The place name of &quot;Hirakata&quot; is very old, appearing in the &quot;Kojiki&quot;, &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; and other ancient texts. During the Asuka period, the early Buddhist temple of Kudara-dera indicates the settlement of many immigrants from Baekje in the Korean Peninsula from an early time. During the Heian period, the hills from Katano to part of Hirakata were called &quot;Katano ga Hara&quot; and were a hunting ground for the imperial family and were famous for cherry blossoms. The Osaka Kaidō, an extension of the Tōkaidō highway passed through the area, and in the Edo Period Hirakata-juku developed as a post station on the highway and a river port on the Yodo River.

The Hirakata Town was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. Hirakata was elevated to city status on August 1, 1947. On April 1, 2001, Hirakata was designated as a special city of Japan. On April 1, 2014, Hirakata became a Core city with increased local autonomy.

==History==
The area of the modern city of Izumisano was within ancient Izumi Province. The area also had many Kofun period burial mounds from the 5th to 7th century AD. From the Kamakura to the Muromachi period a large portion of the area was controlled by Hine-no-shō, a large landed estate owned by the Kujō family of Court nobility. In the Edo Period, much of the city area was controlled by Kishiwada Domain with smaller portions controlled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate.

After the Meiji restoration, the village of Sano established within Hine District with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. On April 1, 1896, the area became part of Sennan District, Osaka. Sano was elevated to town status on October 1, 1911. Sano annexed the village of Kitanakado on April 1, 1937. On April 1, 1948, Sano was promoted to city status. To avoid confusion with Sano, Tochigi, the city name was chosen to be Izumisano.On April 1, 1954, the city expanded to its present area by annexing the neighboring villages of Minaminakadori, Nagataki, Kaminogo, Hineno and Otsuchi. Kansai International Airport was opened on April 4, 1994, with Rinku Town commercial development opening in 1995. Izumisano entered into discussions to merge with Sennan, Misaki, Hannan and Tajiri to form the city of &quot;Sennanshu&quot; (南泉州市) from 2001 to 2004; however, per a public referendum, only Misaki was in favor of the merger and the plans were abandoned.

==Government==
Izumisano has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 18 members. Izumisano collectively with the cities of Kaizuka, Sennan, and the smaller municipalities of Sen&#x27;nan District contributes two members to the Osaka Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Osaka 19th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
The main industries of Izumisano remain food-related: agriculture, commercial fishing and food processing. The main crops are onions, eggplants, cabbage, and broccoli. Textile production is also important, with the city accounting for 47% of domestic towel production. Due to the proximity of Kansai International Airport, airport-support and aviation-related industries have increase. Peach Aviation has its head office in Izumisano. The city is also home to the 256-m (840-ft) Rinku Gate Tower Building, the third tallest building in Japan.

<text>The First Boer War (, ), was fought from 16 December 1880 until 23 March 1881 between the British Empire and Boers of the Transvaal (as the South African Republic was known while under British administration). The war resulted in a Boer victory and eventual independence of the South African Republic. The war is also known as the &quot;First Anglo–Boer War&quot;, the &quot;Transvaal War&quot; or the &quot;Transvaal Rebellion.&quot;

==Background==

In the 19th century a series of events occurred in the southern part of the African continent, with the British from time to time attempting to set up a single unified state there, while at other times wanting to control less territory. The British Empire&#x27;s expansion in South Africa was accelerated due to the desire to control trade routes between India via the Cape of Good Hope, the discovery of diamonds in Kimberley in 1867, and the race against other European Powers to control as much of Africa as possible.

The British annexation of the Transvaal in 1877 represented one of their biggest incursions into Southern Africa, but other expansions also occurred. In 1868 the British Empire annexed Basutoland (modern Lesotho in the Drakensberg mountains, surrounded by the Cape Colony, the Orange Free State and Natal), following an appeal from Moshoeshoe, the leader of a mixed group of mostly Sotho-speaking refugees from the Difaqane who sought British protection against both the Boers and the Zulus. In the 1880s, the Tswana country became an object of dispute between the Germans to the west, the Boers to the east, and the British in the Cape Colony to the south. Although the Tswana country had at the time almost no economic value, the &quot;Missionaries Road&quot; passed through it toward territory farther north. After the Germans annexed Damaraland and Namaqualand (modern Namibia) in 1884, the British annexed Bechuanaland in two parts in 1885: the Bechuanaland Protectorate (modern Botswana) and British Bechuanaland (later part of the Cape Colony).

Following the Battle of Blaauwberg (1806) Britain had officially acquired the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa from the Dutch in 1815 after the Napoleonic Wars. Certain groups of Dutch-speaking settler farmers (&quot;Boers&quot;) resented British rule, even though British control brought some economic benefits. Successive waves of migrations of Boer farmers (known as &quot;Trekboers&quot; which literally means &quot;travelling farmers&quot;), probed first east along the coast away from the Cape toward Natal, and thereafter north toward the interior, eventually establishing the republics that came to be known as the Orange Free State and the Transvaal (literally &quot;across/beyond the Vaal River&quot;).

The British did not try to stop the Trekboers from moving away from the Cape. The Trekboers functioned as pioneers, opening up the interior for those who followed, and the British gradually extended their control outwards from the Cape along the coast toward the east, eventually annexing Natal in 1843.

The Trekboers were farmers, gradually extending their range and territory with no overall agenda. The formal abolition of slavery in the British Empire in 1834 led to more organised groups of Boer settlers attempting to escape British rule, some travelling as far north as modern-day Mozambique. This became known as the Great Trek, and those who took part in it are called Voortrekkers.

Indeed, the British subsequently acknowledged two new Boer Republics in a pair of treaties: the Sand River Convention of 1852 recognised the independence of the Transvaal Republic, and the Bloemfontein Convention of 1854 recognised the independence of the Orange Free State. However, British colonial expansion, from the 1830s, featured skirmishes and wars against both Boers and native African tribes for most of the remainder of the century.

The discovery of diamonds in 1867 near the Vaal River, some northeast of Cape Town, ended the isolation of the Boers in the interior and changed South African history. The discovery triggered a diamond rush that attracted people from all over the world, turning Kimberley into a town of 50,000 within five years and drawing the attention of British imperial interests. In the 1870s the British annexed West Griqualand, site of the Kimberley diamond-discoveries.

In 1875 the Earl of Carnarvon, the British Colonial Secretary, in an attempt to extend British influence, approached the Orange Free State and the Transvaal Republic and tried to organise a federation of the British and Boer territories modelled on the 1867 federation of the French and English provinces of Canada. However the cultural and historical context differed entirely, and the Boer leaders turned him down. Successive British annexations, and in particular the annexation of West Griqualand, caused a climate of simmering unease in the Boer republics. In 1877, the British annexed the Transvaal, which was bankrupt, and under threat from the Zulu. The president of the Transvaal Republic from 1872 to 1877 was T.F. Burgers. The Transvaal Republic was in serious financial trouble because the government had fallen behind on tax collection and a war with the Pedi under the leadership of Sekhukhune in the North-East Transvaal had commenced. 

Sir Theophilus Shepstone was sent by Lord Carnarvon (British Secretary of the Colonies) as a special commissioner to the Transvaal. Shepstone did not initially disclose his true intentions to the Transvaal government, but at the end of January 1877 Shepstone admitted to Burgers that Britain was going to annex the Transvaal Republic. Burgers&#x27; response was to convince the Transvaal government to act in a more serious manner, but the Transvaal government refused to see the urgency of their predicament. Lord Carnarvon thought that the annexation of the Transvaal would be the first step in creating a British confederation. 

On 12 April 1877, a proclamation of the annexation of the Transvaal Republic was made in Church Square, Pretoria, the capital city of the Transvaal. The Transvaal Republic was now known as the British Colony of the Transvaal. A Transvaal government delegation comprising Paul Kruger and E. J. P. Jorrisen went to London in 1877 to present their case on behalf of the Transvaal to Lord Carnarvon, but their efforts were unsuccessful. The Transvaal Volksraad (People&#x27;s Council) asked Transvaal citizens not to commit acts of violence, as this would create a negative image of the Transvaal in Britain. In April 1880, the Liberal Party was elected as the new government in Britain and the feeling in the Transvaal was that it would lead to the return of sovereignty to the Transvaal. However, the new British Prime Minister, W.E. Gladstone reiterated British control of the Transvaal. In October 1880, a newspaper from Paarl in the Cape Colony reported: &quot;Passive resistance is now becoming futile&quot;.

==Outbreak of war==
With the defeat of the Zulus, and the Pedi, the Transvaal Boers were able to give voice to the growing resentment against the 1877 British annexation of the Transvaal and complained that it had been a violation of the Sand River Convention of 1852, and the Bloemfontein Convention of 1854.

Major-General Sir George Pomeroy Colley, after returning briefly to India, finally took over as Governor of Natal, Transvaal, High Commissioner of SE Africa and Military Commander in July 1880. Multiple commitments prevented Colley from visiting the Transvaal where he knew many of the senior Boers. Instead he relied on reports from the Administrator, Sir Owen Lanyon, who had no understanding of the Boer mood or capability. Belatedly Lanyon asked for troop reinforcements in December 1880 but was overtaken by events.

The Boers revolted on 16 December 1880 and took action at Bronkhorstspruit against a British column of the 94th Foot who were returning to reinforce Pretoria.

==1880–1881 war==

The trigger for the war came when a Boer named Piet Bezuidenhout (see Gerhardminnebron) refused to pay an illegally inflated tax. Government officials seized his wagon and attempted to auction it off to pay the tax on 11 November 1880, but a hundred armed Boers disrupted the auction, assaulted the presiding sheriff, and reclaimed the wagon. The first shots of the war were fired when this group fought back against government troops who were sent after them.

After the Transvaal formally declared independence from the United Kingdom, the war began on 16 December 1880 with shots fired by Transvaal Boers at Potchefstroom. During this skirmish, the Boer &quot;commando&quot; was led by General Piet Cronjé. This led to the action at Bronkhorstspruit on 20 December 1880, where the Boers ambushed and destroyed a British Army convoy. From 22 December 1880 to 6 January 1881, British army garrisons all over the Transvaal became besieged.

Although generally called a war, the actual engagements were of a relatively minor nature considering the few men involved on both sides and the short duration of the combat, lasting some ten weeks.

The fiercely independent Boers had no regular army; when danger threatened, all the men in a district would form a militia organised into military units called commandos and would elect officers. Commandos being civilian militia, each man wore what he wished, usually everyday dark-grey, neutral-coloured, or earthtone khaki farming clothes such as a jacket, trousers and slouch hat. Each man brought his own weapon, usually a hunting rifle, and his own horses. The average Boer citizens who made up their commandos were farmers who had spent almost all their working lives in the saddle, and, because they had to depend on both their horses and their rifles for almost all of their meat, they were skilled hunters and expert marksmen. 

Most of the Boers had single-shot breech-loading rifle, primarily the .450 Westley Richards, a falling-block, single-action, breech-loading rifle, with accuracy up to 600 yards.

J. Lehmann&#x27;s &quot;The First Boer War&quot;, 1972, comments &quot;Employing chiefly the very fine breech-loading Westley Richards - calibre 45; paper cartridge; percussion-cap replaced on the nipple manually - they made it exceedingly dangerous for the British to expose themselves on the skyline&quot;. Other rifles included the Martini-Henry and the Snider–Enfield. Only a few had repeaters like the Winchester or the Swiss Vetterli. As hunters they had learned to fire from cover, from a prone position and to make the first shot count, knowing that if they missed, in the time it took to reload, the game would be long gone. At community gatherings, they often held target shooting competitions using targets such as hens&#x27; eggs perched on posts over 100 yards away. The Boer commandos made for expert light cavalry, able to use every scrap of cover from which they could pour accurate and destructive fire at the British.

The British infantry uniforms at that date were red jackets, dark blue trousers with red piping on the side, white pith helmets and pipe clayed equipment, a stark contrast to the African landscape. The Highlanders wore the kilt, and khaki uniforms (They had just been involved in the Second Afghan War). The standard infantry weapon was the Martini-Henry single-shot breech-loading rifle with a long sword bayonet. Gunners of the Royal Artillery wore blue jackets. The Boer marksmen could easily snipe at British troops from a distance. The Boers carried no bayonets, leaving them at a substantial disadvantage in close combat, which they avoided as often as possible. Drawing on years of experience of fighting frontier skirmishes with numerous and indigenous African tribes, they relied more on mobility, stealth, marksmanship and initiative while the British emphasised the traditional military values of command, discipline, formation and synchronised firepower. The average British soldier was not trained to be a marksman and got little target practice. What shooting training British soldiers had was mainly as a unit firing in volleys on command.

===Action at Bronkhorstspruit===
On 20 December 1880, Lieutenant-Colonel Philip Robert Anstruther and men of the 94th Foot (Connaught Rangers) were on their way to quell the Boer uprising in Pretoria, when they were ambushed by Boer Forces near the Bronkhorstspruit Stream, about 120 men were killed or wounded by Boer fire within minutes of the first shots. Boer losses totalled two killed and five wounded. This mainly Irish regiment was marching westward toward Pretoria, led by Lieutenant-Colonel Anstruther, when halted by a Boer commando group. They were halted when they approached the Bronkhorstspruit, 38 miles from Pretoria. The Boer leader, Commandant Frans Joubert (brother of General Piet Joubert), ordered Anstruther and the column to turn back, stating that the territory was now again a Boer Republic and therefore any further advance by the British would be deemed an act of war. Anstruther refused and ordered that ammunition be distributed. The Boers opened fire and the ambushed British troops were annihilated. In the ensuing engagement, the column lost 56 men dead and 92 wounded. With the majority of his troops dead or wounded, the dying Anstruther ordered surrender.

The Boer uprising caught the six small British forts scattered around the Transvaal by surprise. They housed some 2,000 troops between them, including irregulars with as few as fifty soldiers at Lydenburg in the east which Anstruther had just left. Being isolated, and with so few men, all the forts could do was prepare for a siege and wait to be relieved. By 6 January 1881, Boers had begun to besiege Lydenburg. The other five forts, with a minimum of fifty miles between any two, were at Wakkerstroom and Standerton in the south, Marabastad in the north and Potchefstroom and Rustenburg in the west. Boers begun to besiege Marabastad fort on 29 December 1880.

The three main engagements of the war were all within about sixteen miles of each other, centred on the Battles of Laing&#x27;s Nek (28 January 1881), Ingogo River (8 February 1881) and the rout at Majuba Hill (27 February 1881). These battles were the result of Colley&#x27;s attempts to relieve the besieged forts. Although he had requested reinforcements, these would not reach him until mid-February. Colley was, however, convinced that the garrisons would not survive until then. Consequently, at Newcastle, near the Transvaal border, he mustered a relief column (the Natal Field Force) of available men, although this amounted to only 1,200 troops. Colley&#x27;s force was further weakened in that few were mounted, a serious disadvantage in the terrain and for that type of warfare. Most Boers were mounted and good riders. Nonetheless, Colley&#x27;s force set out on 24 January 1881 northward for Laing&#x27;s Nek &quot;en route&quot; to relieve Wakkerstroom and Standerton, the nearest forts.

===Laing&#x27;s Nek===

In a display of diplomacy before the beginning of the Battle, British commander Sir George Colley sent a message on 23 January 1881 to the Commandant-General of the Boers, Piet Joubert, calling on him to disband his forces or face the full might of Imperial Britain. He wrote &quot;The men who follow you are, many of them ignorant, and know and understood a little of anything outside their own country. But you, who are well educated and have travelled, cannot but be unaware how hopeless is the struggle you have embarked upon, and how little any accidental success gained can affect the ultimate result&quot;.

Without waiting for a reply, Colley led his Natal Field Force – consisting of 1,400 men, an 80-strong Naval brigade, artillery and Gatling guns – to a strategic pass in the hills on the Natal-Transvaal border called Laing&#x27;s Nek. 
At the battle of Laing&#x27;s Nek on 28 January 1881, the Natal Field Force under Major-General Sir George Pomeroy Colley attempted with cavalry and infantry attacks to break through the Boer positions on the Drakensberg mountain range to relieve their garrisons. The British were repelled with heavy losses by the Boers under the command of Piet Joubert. 480 British troops were engaged, suffering 150 casualties. Furthermore, sharpshooting Boers had killed or wounded many senior officers.

===Schuinshoogte===

At the battle of Schuinshoogte (also known as Battle of the Carrots) on 8 February 1881, another British force barely escaped destruction. General Colley had sought refuge with the Natal Field Force at Mount Prospect, three miles to the south, to await reinforcements. However, Colley was soon back in action. On 7 February, a mail escort on its way to Newcastle had been attacked by the Boers and forced back to Mount Prospect. The next day Colley, determined to keep his supplies and communication route open, escorted the mail wagon personally and this time with a larger escort. The Boers attacked the convoy at the Ingogo River crossing, but with a stronger force of some 400 men. The firepower was not matched and the fight continued for several hours, but the Boer marksmen dominated the action until darkness when a storm permitted Colley and the remainder of his troops to retreat back to Mount Prospect. In this engagement, the British lost 139 officers and troops, half the original force that had set out to escort the mail convoy.

Colley had been forced to leave behind many of the wounded to die of exposure. In the space of ten days, he had lost one-quarter of his field force, either dead or wounded. &quot;One or two Pyrrhic victories like this and we shan&#x27;t have an army left at all&quot;, Lieutenant Percival Marling wrote at the time. 

On 12 February, Colley received reinforcements consisting of the 92nd (Gordon Highlanders) Regiment of Foot, and the 15th (The King&#x27;s Hussar&#x27;s), with the  6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons, the 83rd (Country of Dublin) Regiment under the command of Sir Evelyn Wood, on the way.

On 14 February hostilities were suspended, awaiting the outcome of peace negotiations initiated by an offer from Paul Kruger. During this time, Colley&#x27;s promised reinforcements arrived, with more to follow. The British government in the meantime had offered a Royal Commission investigation and possible troop withdrawal and their attitude toward the Boers was conciliatory. Colley was critical of this stance and, while waiting for Kruger&#x27;s final agreement, decided to attack again with a view to enabling the British government to negotiate from a position of strength. This resulted in the disaster of the Battle of Majuba Hill on 27 February 1881, the greatest defeat for the British. The British, though they had the superior numbers, were slaughtered.

===Majuba Hill===
On 26 February 1881, Colley led a night march of some 400 men from the 92nd Highlanders, the 58th Regiment, and the Natal Brigade. They reached the top of Majuba Hill, which overlooked the main Boer position. The troops took no artillery with them. At first light, a group of Highlanders advertised their presence by standing on the skyline, shaking their fists, and yelling at the Boers below. The Boers saw the British occupying the summit and stormed the mountain using dead ground. Shooting accurately and using all available natural cover, the Boers advanced toward the British position. Several Boer groups stormed the hill and drove the British off. As panic took hold, terrified British soldiers sprinted for the rear, then fled down the hillside. 

The British suffered heavy losses, with 92 killed, 134 injured, and 59 men were taken prisoner. Major-General Colley was among the dead; he was fatally shot in the head when trying to rally his men. Of the Boers, six were wounded, one fatally. Within 30 minutes the British were swept off the summit. 

For the British the shame of Majuba was even more intense than that of Isandlwana. Elite units like the 92nd Highlanders had cut and run in the face of Boer irregulars. This defeat had such an impact that during the Second Boer War, one of the British slogans was &quot;Remember Majuba.&quot; 

Hostilities continued until 6 March 1881, when a truce was declared, ironically on the same terms that Colley had disparaged. The Transvaal forts had endured, contrary to Colley&#x27;s forecast, with the sieges being generally uneventful, the Boers content to wait for hunger and sickness to take their toll. The forts had suffered only light casualties as an outcome of sporadic engagements, except at Potchefstroom, where twenty-four were killed, and seventeen at Pretoria, in each case resulting from occasional raids on Boer positions.

===Outcome and impact===
Although the Boers exploited their advantages to the full, their unconventional tactics, marksmanship and mobility do not fully explain the heavy British losses. Like the Boers, British soldiers were equipped with breech-loading rifles (the Martini-Henry), but they (unlike the Boers) were professionals, and the British Army had previously fought campaigns in difficult terrain and against an elusive enemy, such as the tribesmen of the Northern Territories in modern-day Afghanistan. Historians lay much of the blame at the feet of the British command, in particular Major-General Sir George Pomeroy Colley, although poor intelligence and bad communications also contributed to their losses. At Laing&#x27;s Nek it seems that Colley not only underestimated the Boer capabilities, but had been misinformed of, and was surprised by, the strength of the Boer forces. The confrontation at Ingogo Nek was perhaps rash, given that reserves were being sent, and Colley had by then experienced the Boer strength and capabilities. Indeed, strategists have speculated as to whether the convoy should have proceeded at all when it was known to be vulnerable to attack, and whether it was necessary for Colley himself to take command of the British guard.

Colley&#x27;s decision to initiate the attack at Majuba Hill when truce discussions were already underway appears to have been foolhardy, particularly as there was limited strategic value. The Boer positions were also out of rifle range from the summit. Once the Battle of Majuba Hill had begun, Colley&#x27;s command and understanding of the dire situation seemed to deteriorate as the day went on, as he sent conflicting signals to the British forces at Mount Prospect by heliograph, first requesting reinforcements and then stating that the Boers were retreating. Thus poor leadership, intelligence and communications resulted in the deaths of many British soldiers and Colley himself.

The First Boer War was the first conflict since the American War of Independence in which the British had been decisively defeated and forced to sign a peace treaty under unfavourable terms. The Battle of Laing&#x27;s Nek would be the last occasion where a British regiment carried its official regimental colours into battle.

==1881 peace==

The British government, under Prime Minister William Gladstone, was conciliatory since it realised that any further action would require substantial troop reinforcements, and it was likely that the war would be costly, messy and protracted. Unwilling to get bogged down in a distant war, the British government ordered a truce.

Sir Evelyn Wood (Colley&#x27;s replacement) signed an armistice to end the war on 6 March, and subsequently a peace treaty was signed with Kruger at O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s Cottage on 23 March 1881, bringing the war to an official end. In the final peace treaty, the Pretoria Convention, negotiated by a three-man Royal Commission, the British agreed to complete Boer self-government in the Transvaal under British suzerainty. The Boers accepted the Queen&#x27;s nominal rule and British control over external relations, African affairs, and native districts. 

The Pretoria Convention was signed on 3 August 1881 and ratified on 25 October by the Transvaal Volksraad (parliament). The agreement did not reinstate fully the independence of the Transvaal but kept the state under British suzerainty. British troops withdrew and in 1884, the Pretoria Convention was superseded by the London Convention, which provided for full independence and self-government although still with British control of foreign relations.

When in 1886 a second major mineral find was made at an outcrop on a large ridge some south of the Boer capital at Pretoria, it reignited British imperial interests. The ridge, known locally as the &quot;Witwatersrand&quot; (literally &quot;white water ridge&quot; – a watershed), contained the world&#x27;s largest deposit of gold-bearing ore. This discovery made the Transvaal, which had been a struggling Boer republic, potentially a political and economic threat to British supremacy in South Africa at a time when Britain was engaged in the scramble for African colonies with France and Germany.
===Tensions among the governments===
In 1896, Cecil Rhodes, Prime Minister of the Cape Colony, attempted to overthrow the government of Paul Kruger who was then president of the South African Republic or the Transvaal. The raid, known as Jameson Raid, failed.

By 1899, tensions erupted into the Second Boer War, caused partly by the rejection of an ultimatum by the British. The Transvaal ultimatum had demanded that all disputes between the Orange Free State and the Transvaal (allied since 1897) be settled by arbitration and that British troops should leave. The lure of gold made it worth committing the vast resources of the British Empire and incurring the huge costs required to win that war. However, the sharp lessons the British had learned during the First Boer War – which included Boer marksmanship, tactical flexibility and good use of ground – had largely been forgotten when the second war broke out 18 years later. Heavy casualties, as well as many setbacks, were incurred before the British were ultimately victorious.

== Aftermath ==
The First Boer War resulted in a disaster for the British government, which had not lost a war to a rebellion since the American War of Independence in 1783. The South Africa Republic (aka Transvaal) was also established as an independent republic under British suzerainty, but they lost this status at the London Convention of 1884 which removed the SAR from British influence. In 1885, tensions rose between Transvaal and the British Government when gold was discovered on the Witwatersrand farm, which led to an influx of foreign (mostly British) labor. This new workforce of mostly British citizens threatened the balance of power in the Transvaal, and increased tensions between them and the British Empire. In 1895 the failed Jameson Raid led by Cecil Rhodes and Leander Starr Jameson increased tensions further between Britain and Transvaal. Eventually in 1899, war broke out between Transvaal and the British Empire.

<doc id="329212" wikidata="Q714744" url="?curid=329212" title="Mohammad Beheshti">
<text>Sayyed Mohammad Hosseini Beheshti (; 24 October 1928 – 28 June 1981) was an Iranian jurist, poetic philosopher, cleric and politician who was known as the second person in the political hierarchy of Iran after the Revolution. Beheshti is considered to have been the primary architect of Iran&#x27;s post-revolution constitution, as well as the administrative structure of the Islamic republic. Beheshti is also known to have selected and trained several prominent politicians in the Islamic Republic, such as former presidents Hassan Rouhani and Mohammad Khatami, Ali Akbar Velayati, Mohammad Javad Larijani, Ali Fallahian, and Mostafa Pourmohammadi. Beheshti also served as the Secretary General of the Islamic Republic Party, and was the head of the Iranian judicial system. He further served as Chairman of the Council of Islamic Revolution, and the Assembly of Experts. Beheshti earned a PhD in philosophy, and was fluent in English, German and Arabic.

On 28 June 1981, Beheshti was assassinated in the Hafte tir bombing by the People&#x27;s Mujahedin of Iran (MEK), along with more than 70 members of the Islamic Republic Party, including four cabinet ministers and 23 members of parliament. The Iranian government blamed Mohammad Reza Kolahi as the MEK operative involved in the incident. Following his death, Ayatollah Khomeini referred to Beheshti as a person who was &quot;as a nation for us.&quot;

==Early years and education==
Beheshti was born in Isfahan in 1928. He studied both at the University of Tehran and under Muhammad Husayn Tabatabaei in Qom. Between 1965 and 1970, he led the Islamic Center in Hamburg where he was responsible for the spiritual leadership of religious Iranian students in Germany and western Europe. In Hamburg, he also worked with Mohammad Khatami and was among his influences. From the early 1960s he was involved in activities against the monarchy and was arrested several times by the Shah&#x27;s secret police, the SAVAK.

Beheshti joined Ayatollah Khomeini in Najaf, Iraq, where the latter was in exile. There he became part of Khomeini&#x27;s underground movement.

==Career==
Following the Islamic revolution, Beheshti became one of the original members of the Council of Revolution of Iran and soon its chairman. As vice-president, he played a particularly important role in promoting the principle of velayat-e faqih as the basis for the new constitution. In the first post-revolutionary Iranian parliament, he led the Islamic Republic party together with Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. (However, he never campaigned for the parliament, for he was already the head of Iran&#x27;s Supreme Judicial System). Behesti was the founding member, first general secretary and a central committee member of the party. He was also planning to run for the presidency in the first presidential elections, but withdrew after Ayatollah Khomeini told a delegation of Rafsanjani and Khamenei that he preferred non-clerics as presidents, which led to the Islamic Republic party&#x27;s endorsement of (firstly) Jalaleddin Farsi and (subsequently) Hasan Habibi as candidate.

==Assassination==

On 28 June 1981, Beheshti was killed in the Hafte tir bombing during a party conference. A spokesman for Iran&#x27;s revolutionary guards said in an interview that a People&#x27;s Mujahedin of Iran member, Mohammad Reza Kolahi, had been responsible.

According to James Buchan, the Islamic Republic of Iran first blamed the Tudeh Party, SAVAK, and the Iraqi regime. Two days later, Ruhollah Khomeini accused the MEK. A few years later, a Kermanshah tribunal executed four &quot;Iraqi agents&quot; for the incident. Another tribunal in Tehran executed Mehdi Tafari for the same incident. In 1985, the head of military intelligence informed the press that this had been the work of royalist army officers. Iran&#x27;s security forces blamed the United States and &quot;internal mercenaries&quot;.

Along with Beheshti, many clerics, ministers, and officials also died in the bombing. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini was reportedly very moved by Beheshti&#x27;s death. A commemoration ceremony is organized each year on the day of Beheshti&#x27;s assassination.

==Works==
Beheshti authored numerous books during his life. After his death, around 24 books were written about him during 30 years. Some of the books are the product of his lectures. Some of his works were translated into Arabic. Some of them are as follows:

*&quot;Background of the birth of Islam&quot; (translated to English)
*&quot;Philosophy of Islam&quot;
*&quot;Dos and Don&#x27;ts&quot;
*&quot;Al Ghavaed Va Al Feghhiyat&quot;
*&quot;Islamic Economy&quot;
*&quot;Right and Fault&quot;
*&quot;Pilgrimage in Quran&quot;
*&quot;Unity in Quran&quot;
*&quot;The Problem of Property&quot;
*&quot;God from the Viewpoint of the Quran&quot;
*&quot;Banking and Financial Laws in Islam&quot;
*&quot;What Do We Know about the Political Party?&quot;
*&quot;Review and Analysis of Jihad, Justice, Liberalism, Imamate&quot;
*&quot;School and Specialty&quot;
==Opinions==
Beheshti had an important role in writing the constitution of Iran, particularly the economic section. He believed in cooperative companies (Ta&#x27;avoni) in the field of economy and partnership and co-operation in lieu of competition in economic affairs. According to him, in Ta&#x27;avoni companies there is no middle man between producer and consumer. He also asserts that in such entities, legal rights belong to members rather than stock holders. He claims the foundation of Iran&#x27;s Constitution to be Islamic, and that Iran&#x27;s revolutionary Islamic system is at the same time a people-oriented system according to the volition of the Iranian people. This system is designed for the betterment and evolution of humankind. According to Beheshti, one of the most important pillars of political thought is that human could walk in right path along with faith to truth.

===Philosophy of jurisprudence===

According to Beheshti, the origin of property and possession in Islam is working.

===Epistemology===
Beheshti raised some epistemological questions in &quot;Knowledge from the Quran&#x27;s View Point&quot;. He believed that knowledge no definition, and that no definition can be found. Beheshti believed there are only four sources of knowledge: perception, introspection, reason and revelation (or Vahy). He coupled an empiric attitude with foundationalism in his structure of knowledge.

===Anthropology===

Beheshti, opposed to modernism, believed that there is a strict relationship between individual and collective aspects of human being. According to him, although the history of humans shows that they are always tend to falsehood (or Batil), the Quran says there is a strong link between humanity and truth. Beheshti also emphasized on the theory of Fitarat (innateness or primary nature) in anthropology. Beheshti also believed the human soul had to be considered in the whole rather than in part. According to the theory of primary nature, one of the characters of human soul is volition and choosing. At the same time humans undertake responsibility for their actions. Humans have two important qualities: freedom of choice and responsibility. In other words, Beheshti believes Islam has a realist slant in respect to humans as it considers humans as a mix of freedom of choice and responsibility. Whilst humans are given choice, faith has an important role in this way and could help humans in making decision.

===Museum===
Seyyed Mohammad Beheshti&#x27;s house in the Gholhak neighborhood was turned into a museum in July 1992. The house consists of two parts and the artists tried to show both parts; A part of Beheshti&#x27;s social life is like the meeting room, where many things happened before and after the Islamic Revolution, and he was arrested at least twice by SAVAK agents; There are also several meetings between religious modernists, the Revolutionary Council, the Council of Fighting Clergy that have been formed in this place, which are related to his social life in this house.
The other part is the family part of the building, which evokes memories of his behavior with the family.

On April 1, 1896, the area became part of Senboku District, Osaka. During the Russo-Japanese War, a large Prisoner-of-war camp was constructed on the coast of Takaishi, with an area of 430,000 square meters and a capacity to house 28,000 prisoners. The area is now a residential area. Takaishi was promoted to town status on January 1, 1915. The neighboring village of Toriishi was annexed on April 1, 1953. Takaishi was promoted to city status on November 1, 1966. The city experienced a severe financial crisis in the late 1990s and the mayor at that time attempted to merge the city with Sakai.

<text>is a city located in Osaka Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 52,350 in 24093 households and a population density of 1400 persons per km2. The total area of the city is .

==Geography==
Hannan is located in the southwestern part of Osaka prefecture, bordered by Osaka Bay to the north and the Izumi Mountains and Wakayama Prefecture to the south. The city is about 45 kilometers from the center of Osaka city and about 10 kilometer from the center of Wakayama city

===Neighboring municipalities===
Osaka Prefecture
*Misaki
*Sennan
Wakayama Prefecture
*Iwade
*Wakayama

==Climate==
Hannan has a Humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light to no snowfall. The average annual temperature in Hannan is 15.9 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1713 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 26.7 °C, and lowest in January, at around 5.7 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Hannan has increased steadily from the year 1920 to the year 2000, and has started to slowly decline since..

==History==
The area of the modern city of Hannan was within ancient Izumi Province. Archaeologists have found artifacts from the Japanese Paleolithic period and tombs from the Jōmon period of 10,000 years ago. The area also had many Kofun period burial mounds from the 5th to 7th century AD. In the Edo Period, much of the city area was controlled by Kishiwada Domain with smaller portions controlled by Yodo Domain or directly by the Tokugawa shogunate.

After the Meiji restoration, the villages of Ozaki, Nishitottori, Higashitottori, and Shimoshō were established within Hine District with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. On April 1, 1896 the area became part of Sennan District, Osaka. Ozaki was elevated to town status on June 1, 1939. On September 30, 1956 Ozaki merged with Nishitottori-mura, and Shimoshō to form the town of Hankai (南海町). On November 1, 1960 the village of Higashitottori was elevated to town status. On October 20, 1972 the towns of Nankai and Higashitottori merged to form town of Hannan.The town&#x27;s name was derived from the &quot;onyomi&quot; reading of the &quot;kanji&quot; 阪 (&quot;han&quot;), standing for Osaka prefecture (大阪府), and the kanji 南 (&quot;nan&quot;), meaning south. Thus it means &quot;Southern Osaka&quot;. On October 1, 1991, Hannan attained city status as the newest city in Osaka Prefecture. Hannan entered into discussions to merge with either Sennan and Misaki, or with Sennan, Misaki, Izumisano and Tajiri to form the city of &quot;Sennanshu&quot; (南泉州市) from 2001 to 2004; however, per a public referendum, only Misaki was in favor of the merger and the plans were abandoned.

==Government==
Hannan has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 14 members. Hannan collectively with the cities of Kaizuka, Sennan, and the town of Misaki contributes two members to the Osaka Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Osaka 19th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
The main industry of Hannan since the Edo Period was traditionally textile production of cotton and silk, using the abundant waters from the Izumi Mountains. At one point there were over 700 companies involved in textile production, but the rise of synthetics and overseas competition has severely impacted this industry. Likewise, Hannan was noted for its production of asbestos cloth, and more than 200 companies involved in the asbestos industry existed in Sennan from the Meiji period until the production and use of asbestos was banned. Another traditional industry is the quarrying of sandstone. In terms of primary industries, commercial fishing (including the farming of &quot;nori&quot; edible seaweed and oysters) and agriculture (notably a local variety of eggplant and onions) is also an important component of the economy.

==Education==
Hannan has seven public elementary schools and four public middle schools operated by the city government and one public high school operated by the Osaka Prefectural Department of Education.

The average annual rainfall is 1578 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 26.4 °C, and lowest in January, at around 3.3 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Nishinomiya grew rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s, and has been increasing at a slower rate since.

== History ==
The area of Nishinomiya was part of ancient Settsu Province and has been inhabited since ancient times, with the traces of Yayoi period settlements, many kofun burial mounds found within the city limits. From the Asuka period, the Hirota Shrine was built, and the market town which developed around its west gate was the ancestor of &quot;Nishinomiya&quot;. From the Muromachi period, Nishinomiya was famed for its production of &quot;sake&quot;. During the Edo Period, the area was &quot;tenryō&quot; territory under the direct administration of the Tokugawa shogunate. The town of Nishinomiya was established on April 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. Nishinomiya was a center of the culture from the 1910s to 1940s in which has been dubbed &quot;Hanshinkan Modernism&quot;. This included the opening of the Kōshien Stadium opened on April 1, 1924. Nishinomiya was elevated to city status on April 1, 1925. The city expanded with the annexation of the town of Imazu and villages of Shiba and Taishi in April 1933, the village of Koto in February 1941, the village of Kawaragi in May 1942, and the villages of Naruo, Yamaguchi and Shiose in April 1951. The January 17, 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake caused widespread damage in Nishinomiya.

==Government==

==History==
The Tatsuno area was part of ancient Harima Province and was an important location for traffic on the Izumo Kaidō highway running along the Ibo River, and was the location of Kinoyama Castle, a stronghold of the Akamatsu clan in the Muromachi period. After Oda Nobunaga gained supremacy during the Sengoku period, the area became the territory of the Ikeda clan, who ruled Himeji Domain in the early Edo period. Following Ikeda Toshitaka&#x27;s death, his lands were divided by the Tokugawa shogunate and Honda Masatomo, was installed as &quot;daimyō&quot; of the newly created Tatsuno Domain. The town prospered as a castle town and the domain passed through various rulers, ultimately coming under the rule of the Wakisaka clan beginning in 1672, lasting 200 years and 10 generations, after which came the Meiji Restoration. The castle town&#x27;s area from the early modern period is extant today in what is now the &quot;old Tatsuno-chō area,” which still contains samurai residences and white-plastered earthen storehouses, giving the city the moniker of&quot;Little Kyoto of Harima&quot;.

The town of Tatsuno was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. On October 1, 2005, the towns of Ibogawa, Mitsu and Shingū (all from Ibo District) were merged into Tatsuno. To reflect the new character of the city, the &quot;kanji&quot; characters in the city&#x27;s name were changed from to .

==Government==
Tatsuno has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 22 members. Tatsuno, together with the town of Taishi, contributes one member to the Hyogo Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Hyōgo 12th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Tatsuno has traditionally been famous for production of sōmen and soy sauce in Japan. However, much of the city is rural, with rice farming and commercial fishing playing roles in the economy. The city is increasing becoming a bedroom community, with 25.0% of those commuting to work go to Himeji (2010 National Census).

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Takarazuka has been increasing steadily since the 1950s.

== History ==
The area of Takarazuka was part of ancient Settsu Province and has been inhabited since ancient times, with many &quot;kofun&quot; burial mounds found within the city limits. The Mefu Jinja dates from the Nara period. From the Heian period, numerous landed estates &quot;shōen&quot; controlled by the Fujiwara family were developed in the area. Takarazuka onsen is mentioned in Kamakura period records. In the Muromachi period, Kohama town developed as a temple town for Kōshō-ji, and subsequently Kohama Inn was established as a post station on Arima Road. The area was mostly &quot;tenryō&quot; territory under direct control of the Tokugawa shogunate in the Edo Period. 

The village of Kohama (小浜村) was established on April 1, 1889 within Kawabe District, Hyōgo, with the creation of the modern municipalities system. In 1897, Hankaku Railroad (current Fukuchiyama Line) completed. In 1910, the Minoh Arima Electric Railway (current Hankyu Takarazuka Main Line completed). Takarazuka was a center of the culture from the 1910s to 1940s in what has been dubbed the age of Hanshinkan Modernism. This included the opening of the Takarazuka Girls&#x27; Opera (current Takarazuka Revue) on April 1, 1914.

Kohama was elevated to town status on March 15, 1951, changing its name to Takarazuka. On April 1 1954 it merged with the village of Yoshimoto (吉本村) in Muko District to become the city of Takarazuka. The city continued to expand by annexing Nagao Village on March 10, 1955, and Nishitani Village on March 14, 1955, but losing some areas in a border adjustment with the city of Itami on April 1, 1955. On January 17, 1995 the Great Hanshin earthquake caused more than 100 casualties. Takarazuka was designated as a Special City on April 1, 2003 with increased autonomy.

<text>Tiger Stadium, previously known as Navin Field and Briggs Stadium, was a multi-use stadium located in the Corktown neighborhood of Detroit, Michigan, United States. The stadium was nicknamed &quot;The Corner&quot; for its location at the intersection of Michigan and Trumbull Avenues. It hosted the Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1912 to 1999, as well as the Detroit Lions of the National Football League (NFL) from 1938 to 1939, 1941 to 1974. Tiger Stadium was declared a State of Michigan Historic Site in 1975 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. 

The last Tigers game at the stadium was held on September 27, 1999. In the decade after the Tigers vacated the stadium, several rejected redevelopment and preservation efforts finally gave way to demolition. The stadium&#x27;s demolition was completed on September 21, 2009, though the playing field remained until 2018, when the site was redeveloped for youth sports as the Corner Ballpark.

==History==
===Origins===
In 1895, Detroit Tigers owner George Vanderbeck had a new stadium built at the corner of Michigan and Trumbull avenues. That stadium was called Bennett Park and featured a wooden grandstand with a wooden peaked roof in the outfield. At the time, some places in the outfield were only marked off with rope.

In 1911, new Tigers owner Frank Navin ordered a new steel-and-concrete baseball park to be built on the same site that would seat 23,000 to accommodate the growing numbers of fans. Navin Field opened on April 20, 1912, the same day as Fenway Park in Boston. While constructed on the same site as Bennett Park, the diamond at Navin Field was rotated 90°, with home plate located in what had been left field at Bennett Park. Cleveland Naps player &quot;Shoeless&quot; Joe Jackson, later banned from baseball for life following the Black Sox Scandal, scored the first run at Navin Field.
Over the years, expansion continued to accommodate more spectators. In 1935, following Navin&#x27;s death, new owner Walter Briggs Sr. oversaw the expansion of Navin Field to a capacity of 36,000 by extending the upper deck to the foul poles and across right field. By 1938, the city had agreed to move Cherry Street, allowing the left-field seats to be double-decked, and the now-renamed Briggs Stadium had a capacity of 53,000. In 1961, new owner John Fetzer took control of the stadium and gave it its final and longest-lasting name: Tiger Stadium.
A fire gutted the press box on the evening of February 1, 1977. In 1977, the Tigers sold the stadium to the city of Detroit, which then leased it back to the Tigers. As part of this transfer, the green wooden seats were replaced with blue and orange plastic ones, and the stadium&#x27;s interior, which was green, was painted blue to match.

By the early 1990s, it was clear that Tiger Stadium was at the end of its useful life. Both the city and Tigers ownership wanted a new park, but many campaigned to save the old stadium. While a plan to modify and maintain Tiger Stadium as the home of the Tigers, known as the Cochrane Plan, was supported by many in the community, it was never seriously considered by the city or the Tigers. Ground was broken for the new Comerica Park on October 29, 1997.

===Features===

Tiger Stadium had a 125-foot (38 m) tall flagpole in fair play, to the left of dead center field near the 440-foot (134 m) mark. The same flag pole was to be brought to Comerica Park, but this never happened. A new flagpole in the spirit of Tiger Stadium&#x27;s pole was positioned in fair play at Comerica Park until the left field fence was moved in closer prior to the 2003 season. 

When it closed, Tiger Stadium was tied with Fenway Park as the oldest stadium in Major League Baseball; the two parks opened on the same date in 1912. Taking predecessor Bennett Park into account, Tiger Stadium was the oldest Major League Baseball site in use in 1999.

When the park was expanded in 1936, a second deck was added over the right field pavilion and bleachers. To fit as many seats as possible in the expansion, the second deck was extended over the fence by 10 feet (3 m). The overhang would occasionally turn some extremely high arced fly balls into home runs. Spotlights were added above the warning track to illuminate the area beneath the overhang. 

Like other older baseball stadiums such as Fenway Park and Wrigley Field, Tiger Stadium offered &quot;obstructed view&quot; seats, some of which were directly behind a steel support column; while others in the lower deck had sight lines obstructed by the low-hanging upper deck. By making it possible for the upper deck to stand directly above the lower deck, the support columns allowed the average fan to sit closer to the field than at any other ballpark.

For a time after it was constructed, the right field upper deck had a &quot;315&quot; marker at the foul pole (later painted over), with a &quot;325&quot; marker below it on the lower deck fence (which was retained). The Texas Rangers claimed that the design of the right field section was copied and used in the construction of what is now Choctaw Stadium, but in fact the upper deck did not actually extend over the right field fence, but was set back by several feet.

Due to then-owner Walter Briggs&#x27;s dislike of night baseball, lights were not installed at the stadium until 1948. The first night game at the stadium was held on June 15, 1948. Among major league parks whose construction predated the advent of night games, only Wrigley Field went longer without lights (1988).

Tiger Stadium featured an upper and lower deck bleacher section that was separated from the rest of the stadium. Chain link and at one time, a barbed wire fence, separated the bleachers from the reserved sections and was the only section of seating not covered by at least part of the roof. The bleachers had their own entrance, concession stands and restrooms.

In 1999, its final season, only this ballpark and Bank One Ballpark had a dirt path that ran from the pitcher&#x27;s mound to home plate. It originally had one before it was removed.

===Professional football===
Tiger Stadium was home of the Detroit Lions from 1938 to 1939, 1941 to 1974. The stadium hosted two NFL Championship Games in 1953 and 1957. The football field ran mostly in the outfield from the right field line to left center field parallel with the third base line. The benches for both the Lions and their opponents were on the outfield side of the field. 

In the early 1970s, the city of Pontiac and its community leaders made a presentation to the Metropolitan Stadium Committee of a site on the city&#x27;s eastern boundary, north of M-59 and near the intersection with Interstate 75 (I-75). Initially, a dual stadium complex was planned that included a moving roof that was later scrapped due to high costs and the lack of a commitment from the Tigers. The Metropolitan Stadium Committee voted unanimously for the Pontiac site. In 1973, ground was broken for a stadium to exclusively house the Lions.

The Lions played their final game at Tiger Stadium on Thanksgiving Day, November 28, 1974, against the Denver Broncos.

===Other events===
In 1939, boxer Joe Louis defended his world heavyweight title with an eleventh-round knockout of Bob Pastor at the stadium.

On October 5, 1951, the University of Notre Dame played the University of Detroit at Briggs Stadium before a capacity crowd of 52,000. It was the first Notre Dame football game to be played at night. The Fighting Irish won, 40–6.

Northern Irish professional soccer club Glentoran F.C. called the stadium home in the late 1960s. The team played as the Detroit Cougars in the United Soccer Association.

Kiss played their first date of the Alive/Worldwide Tour on June 28, 1996. It was the first concert with the original lineup since 1979.

==Notable moments and facts==

When Ty Cobb played at Navin Field, the area of dirt in front of home plate was kept wet by the groundstaff to slow down Cobb&#x27;s bunts and cause opposing infielders to slip as they fielded them. The area was nicknamed &quot;Cobb&#x27;s Lake&quot;.

On July 18, 1921, Babe Ruth hit what is believed to be the longest verified home run in Major League Baseball history. The home run went to straightaway center field, clearing the stadium and landing into the street. The distance of the home run has been estimated at up to . On July 13, 1934, at the stadium, Ruth hit his 700th career home run off Tigers&#x27; pitcher Tommy Bridges. 

On May 2, 1939, ailing New York Yankees first baseman Lou Gehrig voluntarily benched himself at Briggs Stadium, ending his streak of consecutive games at 2,130. Due to the progression of the disease named after him, it was the final game of his career.

The last scoreless tie in the NFL was played at Tiger Stadium between the Detroit Lions and New York Giants on November 7, 1943.

The stadium hosted the 1941, 1951 and 1971 MLB All-Star Games. All three games featured home runs. Ted Williams won the 1941 game with a walk-off three-run home run. The ball was also carrying well in the 1951 and 1971 games. Of the many home runs in those games, the most often replayed is Reggie Jackson&#x27;s drive to right field that hit so high up in the light tower that the TV camera lost sight of it, until it dropped to the field below. Jackson dropped his bat and watched it sail, seemingly astonished at his own power.

Toward the end of the Lions&#x27; game against the Chicago Bears at the stadium on October 24, 1971, Lions wide receiver Chuck Hughes collapsed and later died of a heart attack, making Hughes the only NFL player to date who died during a game.

On April 7, 1986, Dwight Evans hit a home run on the first pitch of Opening Day. This was also the first game on MLB&#x27;s schedule that season, giving Evans the record for the earliest home run to start a season in terms of at bats.

There were over 30 home runs hit onto the right field roof over the years. It was a relatively soft touch compared to left field, with a foul line and with a roof that was in line with the front of the lower deck. In left field, it was farther down the line, and the roof was set back some distance. Only four of the game&#x27;s most powerful right-handed sluggers (Harmon Killebrew, Frank Howard, Cecil Fielder and Mark McGwire) reached the left field rooftop. In his career, Norm Cash hit four home runs over the Tiger Stadium roof in right field and is the all-time leader.

Tiger Stadium saw exactly 11,111 Major League home runs.

===The final game===

On September 27, 1999, the final Tigers game was held at Tiger Stadium; an 8–2 victory over the Kansas City Royals, capped by a late grand slam by Robert Fick, which hit the right field roof. It was the final Major League hit, home run, and RBI in Tiger Stadium&#x27;s history. Following the game, an emotional ceremony with past and present Tigers greats was held to mark the occasion. The Tigers moved to the newly constructed Comerica Park for their 2000 season, leaving Tiger Stadium unused.

==Final years==
On July 24, 2001, the day Detroit celebrated its 300th birthday, a Great Lakes Summer Collegiate League game between the Motor City Marauders and the Lake Erie Monarchs was played at Tiger Stadium. It was an effort by a local sports management company to bring a Frontier League franchise to Detroit.

In February 2006, a tent on Tiger Stadium&#x27;s field played host to Anheuser-Busch&#x27;s Bud Bowl 2006. Among performers at the nightclub-style event was Snoop Dogg. Anheuser-Busch promoted the event as Tiger Stadium&#x27;s Last Call.

In 2006, the feature-length documentary &quot;Stranded at the Corner: The Battle to Save Historic Tiger Stadium&quot; was released. Funded by local businessman and ardent stadium supporter Peter Comstock Riley, and directed by Gary Glaser, it earned solid reviews and won three Telly awards and two Emmy awards for the film&#x27;s writer and co-producer, Richard Bak, a local journalist and the author of two books about the stadium. It was also shown at the inaugural National Baseball Hall of Fame Film Festival in November 2006.

===Demolition===
There were many proposals to redevelop the site. By 2006, however, demolition appeared inevitable when then-Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick announced the stadium would be razed. In June 2007, the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation approved a plan to demolish the stadium, which needed approval from Detroit City Council. In July 2007, Detroit City Council voted 5–4 in approval of the demolition. 

In October 2007, an online auction of the stadium&#x27;s memorabilia was held by Schneider Industries, which drew $192,729. The city used the proceeds to defray the demolition costs. 

The Detroit Economic Growth Corporation awarded the demolition contract on April 22, 2008, with the speculation that demolition revenue would come from the sale of scrap metal. Demolition began on June 30, 2008. A week into demolition, it was announced that the field, foul poles, and flagpole would be preserved.

After a hiatus wherein various plans to preserve portions of the stadium were considered, demolition was completed on September 21, 2009.

===Redevelopment===
During the summer of 2010, a group calling itself &quot;The Navin Field Grounds Crew&quot; began maintaining the playing field and hosting vintage baseball, youth baseball, and softball games at the site. There was at one time also a sign on the enclosing fence labeling the site &quot;Ernie Harwell Park&quot;. 

On December 16, 2014, a $33 million project by Larson Realty Group to redevelop the old Tiger Stadium site was approved by Detroit&#x27;s Economic Development Corporation. Development plans included a four-story building along Michigan Avenue with about of retail space and 102 residential property rental units, each averaging . Along Trumbull Avenue, 24 town homes were planned for sale. Detroit&#x27;s Police Athletic League (PAL) headquarters would relocate to the site and maintain the field. PAL would build its new headquarters and related facilities on the western and northern edges of the site while preserving the historic playing field for youth sports, including high school and college baseball. Construction of the project began in June 2016.

In 2018, the Corner Ballpark opened at the site.

==Films and television==
The stadium was seen in the 1980 feature film &quot;Raging Bull&quot; where it was the site of two of Jake LaMotta&#x27;s championship boxing matches.

It was depicted in Disney&#x27;s award-winning &quot;Tiger Town&quot;, a 1983 made-for-television baseball film written and directed by Detroit native, Alan Shapiro, starring Roy Scheider, Sparky Anderson, Ernie Harwell and Mary Wilson. It was also seen in &quot;Renaissance Man&quot; and &quot;Hardball&quot;. 

In the summer of 2000, the HBO movie &quot;61*&quot; was filmed at Tiger Stadium. The film dramatized the efforts of New York Yankees teammates Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris during the 1961 season to break fellow Yankee Babe Ruth&#x27;s single-season home run record of 60. For the film, computer-generated visual effects were used to make Tiger Stadium resemble Yankee Stadium in 1961. Yankee Stadium is listed in the credits at the end of the film as being played by Tiger Stadium. 

During the last days in which part of Tiger Stadium was still standing, scenes for the film &quot;Kill the Irishman&quot;, which were used to depict Cleveland Stadium, were shot at the stadium. 

The pilot of the HBO series &quot;Hung&quot; featured the stadium&#x27;s demolition in its opening scene.

==In popular culture==
* Artist Gene Mack, who drew a series of pictures of several figures and ballparks, mentioned a bone that Ty Cobb used to &quot;bone&quot; his bats as part of his care for them. The bone stayed in the clubhouse after he left the Tigers in 1926 and, indeed, after he retired in 1928.
* In the music video for rapper Eminem&#x27;s song &quot;Beautiful&quot;, Eminem can be seen walking through the stadium, showing the destruction of the stadium.
* The site was filmed for the &quot;Hung&quot; episode &quot;Fat Off My Love or I&#x27;m the Allergen&quot;.
