<text>Vitagraph Studios, also known as the Vitagraph Company of America, was a United States motion picture studio. It was founded by J. Stuart Blackton and Albert E. Smith in 1897 in Brooklyn, New York, as the American Vitagraph Company. By 1907, it was the most prolific American film production company, producing many famous silent films. It was bought by Warner Bros. in 1925.

==History==
In 1896, English &quot;émigré&quot; Blackton was moonlighting as a reporter/artist for the New York &quot;Evening World&quot; when he was sent to interview Thomas Edison about his new film projector. The inventor talked the entrepreneurial reporter into buying a set of films and a projector. A year later, Blackton and business partner Smith founded the American Vitagraph Company in direct competition with Edison. A third partner, distributor William &quot;Pop&quot; Rock, joined in 1899. The company&#x27;s first studio was located on the rooftop of a building on Nassau Street in Manhattan. Operations were later moved to the Midwood neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York.

The company&#x27;s first claim to fame came from newsreels: Vitagraph cameramen were on the scene to film events from the Spanish–American War of 1898. These shorts were among the first works of motion-picture propaganda, and a few had studio re-enactments that were passed off as footage of actual events (&quot;The Battle of Santiago Bay&quot; was filmed in an improvised bathtub, with the &quot;smoke of battle&quot; provided by Mrs. Blackton&#x27;s cigar). In 1897, Vitagraph produced &quot;The Humpty Dumpty Circus&quot;, which was the first film to use the stop-motion technique.

Vitagraph was not the only company seeking to make money from Edison&#x27;s motion picture inventions, and Edison&#x27;s lawyers were very busy in the 1890s and 1900s filing patents and suing competitors for patent infringement. Blackton did his best to avoid lawsuits by buying a special license from Edison in 1907 and by agreeing to sell many of his most popular films to Edison for distribution.

The American Vitagraph Company made many contributions to the history of movie-making. In 1903, the director Joseph Delmont started his career by producing westerns; he later became famous by using &quot;wild carnivores&quot; in his films—a sensation for that time.

In 1909, it was one of the original ten production companies included in Edison&#x27;s attempt to corner movie-making in the United States, the Motion Picture Patents Company. Due to its extensive European distribution interests, Vitagraph also participated in the Paris Film Congress in February 1909. This was a failed attempt by European producers to form a cartel similar to the MPPC.

==Stars==
Major stars included Florence Turner (the Vitagraph Girl, one of the world&#x27;s first movie stars), Maurice Costello (the first of the matinee idols), Harry T. Morey, Jean (the Vitagraph Dog and the first animal star of the Silent Era) and such future stars as Helen Hayes, Viola Dana, Dolores Costello, Norma Talmadge, Constance Talmadge, and Moe Howard. Larry Trimble was a noted director of films for Turner and Jean (he was also the dog&#x27;s owner).

The first film adaptation of the novel &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, a short silent historical drama starring Maurice Costello as Jean Valjean and William V. Ranous as Javert, is distributed by the Vitagraph Company of America. The film consists of four reels, each released over the course of three months beginning on 4 September to 27 November 1909.

John Bunny made films for Vitagraph in the 1910s, most of them co-starring Flora Finch, and was the most popular film comedian in the world in the years before Chaplin. His death in 1915 was observed worldwide.

In 1910, a number of movie houses showed the five parts of the Vitagraph serial &quot;The Life of Moses&quot; consecutively (a total length of almost 90 minutes), making it one of many to claim the title of &quot;the first feature film.&quot; A long series of Shakespeare adaptations were the first done of the Bard&#x27;s works in the U.S.

In 1911, Vitagraph produced the first aviation film, &quot;The Military Air-Scout&quot;, directed by William J. Humphrey, with future General of the Air Force Hap Arnold as the stunt flier.

The 1915 feature &quot;The Battle Cry of Peace&quot; (written and directed by Blackton) was one of the great propaganda films of World War I. Ironically, after America declared war, the film was modified for re-release because it was seen as not being sufficiently pro-war, thus also earning the film a place in the history of censorship.

==V-L-S-E, Incorporated==
In 1915, Chicago distributor George Kleine orchestrated a four-way film distribution partnership, V-L-S-E, Incorporated, for the &quot;Vitagraph&quot;, Lubin, Selig, L-KO Kompany, and Essanay companies. Albert Smith served as president. In 1916, Benjamin Hampton had proposed a merger of the distribution companies Paramount Pictures and V-L-S-E with Famous Players Film Company and Jesse L. Lasky Feature Play Company, but was foiled by Adolph Zukor. &quot;V-L-S-E&quot; was dissolved on August 17, 1916, when Vitagraph purchased a controlling interest in Lubin, Selig, and Essanay.

==Postwar prosperity==
Vitagraph&#x27;s leading star of the post-World War I period was comedian Larry Semon. He had joined the studio in 1916 as a writer and director, but soon became a star in a steady stream of comedy shorts. A former cartoonist, Semon favored large-scale slapstick. His films were so profitable that Vitagraph gave Semon a free hand in making them, but Semon became so extravagant in staging the films that the expenses nearly broke the company. Semon&#x27;s relationship with Vitagraph became strained when the company insisted that Semon finance the films himself, and he left for Educational Pictures in 1923.

With the loss of foreign distributors and the rise of the monopolistic studio system, Vitagraph was slowly but surely being squeezed out of the business. On January 28, 1925, it left the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (later MPA); the owner, Albert E. Smith, explained: 

==Acquisition by Warner Bros.==
On April 20, 1925, Smith finally gave up and sold the company to Warner Bros. for a comfortable profit. The Flatbush studio (renamed Vitaphone) was later used as an independent unit within Warner Bros., specializing in early sound shorts. Vitaphone closed the Flatbush plant in 1940.

==Vitagraph brand name==
The Vitagraph name was briefly resurrected on two occasions. In 1932–33, producer Leon Schlesinger made six westerns starring John Wayne and released them through the Warner Bros. exchanges. The studio chose to market these very-low-budget features under the less prestigious Vitagraph banner. In 1960 Vitagraph returned to theater screens (starting with 1960&#x27;s Looney Tunes cartoon &quot;Hopalong Casualty&quot;), with the end titles reading &quot;A Warner Bros. Cartoon / A Vitagraph Release&quot;. Merrie Melodies of the same period (starting with that same year&#x27;s &quot;From Hare to Heir&quot;) had the same end title, with the last line being &quot;A Vitaphone Release.&quot; This may have been done to protect the studio&#x27;s ownership of the two dormant trade names. Both the Vitagraph and Vitaphone names were retired in 1969.

==Publication==
Founder Albert E. Smith, in collaboration with coauthor Phil A. Koury, wrote an autobiography, &quot;Two Reels and a Crank&quot;, in 1952. It includes a very detailed history of Vitagraph and a lengthy list of people who had been in the Vitagraph Family which included Billy Anderson, Florence Lawrence, Florence Turner, Florence Auer, Richard Barthelmess, John Bunny, Francis X. Bushman, Dolores Costello, Maurice Costello, Sidney Drew, Dustin Farnum, Flora Finch, Hoot Gibson, Corinne Griffith, Alan Hale, Oliver Hardy, Mildred Harris, Hedda Hopper, Rex Ingram, Alice Joyce, Boris Karloff, J. Warren Kerrigan, Rod La Rocque, E.K. Lincoln, Bessie Love, May McAvoy, Victor McLaglen, Adolphe Menjou, Antonio Moreno, Conrad Nagel, Mabel Normand, Lottie Pickford, Billy Quirk, Wallace Reid, May Robson, Wesley Ruggles, George Stevens, Anita Stewart, Constance Talmadge, Natalie Talmadge, Norma Talmadge, William Desmond Taylor, Alice Terry, George Terwilliger, Florence Vidor, Earle Williams, Clara Kimball Young, and hundreds of other people are listed. In the text of the book he also refers to hiring a 17-year-old Rudolph Valentino into the set-decorating department, but within a week he was being used by directors as an extra in foreign parts, mainly as a Russian Cossack.

==Locations==
Vitagraph&#x27;s first office, opened in 1898, was in Lower Manhattan, at 140 Nassau Street, on the corner of Nassau St. and Beekman St., where they shot their first film, &quot;The Burglar on the Roof&quot;, in 1897. In 1890, the company moved to 110-16 Nassau Street in Brooklyn, New York. They subsequently opened a glass-enclosed studio, the first modern film studio in the U.S., built in 1906, on property bounded by Locust Avenue, East 15th Street, Elm Avenue, and right-of-way of the BMT Brighton Line of the New York City Subway. Transportation of equipment and costumes from the Nassau Street interior stages was by subway to the adjacent Avenue M (BMT Brighton Line) Subway rapid transit station in the Midwood section of Brooklyn. They created a second film studio in Santa Monica, California, in 1911, and a year later moved to a 29-acre sheep ranch at 4151 Prospect Ave in the Los Feliz district of Los Angeles, a studio subsequently owned by ABC and currently Disney Studios.

==Preservation Efforts and Demolition==
The Vitagraph Studios building, located in the Midwood neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, held a significant place in the early history of American cinema. As one of the first motion picture studios in the United States, Vitagraph was responsible for producing hundreds of silent films in the early 20th century. The building, with its recognizable smokestack, remained a physical reminder of the silent film era long after the studio ceased operations and was acquired by Warner Bros. in 1925.

In the latter half of the 20th century, as New York City’s landscape rapidly changed, film historians and preservationists began advocating for the protection of the Vitagraph building due to its historical importance. The structure became a focus of preservation efforts in the 2000s and 2010s, when campaigns were launched to secure landmark status for the site. Supporters, including local historians and members of the film community, argued that the building was one of the last surviving links to New York’s early role as a hub of film production before Hollywood’s rise. They proposed various uses for the building, including transforming it into a museum or cultural center that would honor the legacy of early cinema.

However, the preservation campaigns faced significant obstacles. Opponents of landmark designation, including developers and some local officials, cited the deteriorating condition of the building and its increasingly outdated industrial design. The site’s location in a developing residential neighborhood further complicated efforts, as developers eyed the property for housing projects. In 2008, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission declined to grant the building landmark status, stating that while the Vitagraph building held undeniable cultural significance, it did not meet the architectural criteria for preservation. According to the Commission, “the building has lost many of its original architectural features over the years,” and “the alterations to its structure have compromised its integrity as a historic resource.” The Commission also emphasized that the building&#x27;s utilitarian design did not exemplify the type of architectural distinction typically associated with landmarks, despite its historical connections. In 2012, they further ruled that the smokestack &quot;lacked architectural merit.&quot;

Despite ongoing petitions, appeals, and media attention, the decision stood, and the efforts to protect the building ultimately faltered. In 2015, after years of neglect and unsuccessful attempts to preserve the structure, the Vitagraph Studios building was demolished to make way for new apartment complexes. This demolition marked the end of a tangible piece of early American film history, though it sparked renewed interest in preserving other film heritage sites.

<text>Reginald Maudling (7 March 1917 – 14 February 1979) was a British politician who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1962 to 1964 and as Home Secretary from 1970 to 1972. From 1955 until the late 1960s, he was spoken of as a prospective Conservative leader, and he was twice seriously considered for the post; he was Edward Heath&#x27;s chief rival in 1965. He also held directorships in several British financial firms.

As Home Secretary, he was responsible for the UK Government&#x27;s Northern Ireland policy during the period that included Bloody Sunday. In July 1972, he resigned as Home Secretary due to an unrelated scandal in one of the companies of which he was director.

==Early life==
Reginald Maudling was born in Woodside Park, North Finchley, and was named after his father, Reginald George Maudling, an actuary at R. Watson &amp; Sons and Public Valuer, who contracted to do actuarial and financial calculations as the Commercial Calculating Company Ltd. The family moved to Bexhill to escape German air raids; Maudling won scholarships to the Merchant Taylors&#x27; School and Merton College, Oxford.

He stayed out of undergraduate politics at Oxford, and studied the works of Hegel; he was to formulate his conclusions later as to the inseparability of economic and political freedom: &quot;the purpose of State control and the guiding principle of its application is the achievement of true freedom&quot;. He obtained a first class Greats degree.

==Political career==
Shortly after graduating, Maudling set up a meeting with Harold Nicolson to discuss whether it would be better, as a moderate conservative, to join the Conservative Party or National Labour; Nicolson advised him to wait. Maudling was called to the Bar at the Middle Temple in 1940. However, he did not practise as a barrister, having volunteered for service in the Royal Air Force (RAF) in the Second World War.

Owing to poor eyesight he took desk jobs in the RAF intelligence branch, where he rose—as a &quot;Wingless Wonder&quot;, as officers who were not qualified to wear pilot&#x27;s wings were nicknamed—to the rank of flight lieutenant; he was then appointed Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Air, Sir Archibald Sinclair.

===Parliamentary candidate===
Maudling wrote an essay on Conservative policy in November 1943, recommending that the Conservatives neither imitate the Labour Party nor reflexively oppose all controls; in the general election of July 1945, he was selected as parliamentary candidate for Heston and Isleworth, a newly created constituency in Middlesex, although there were four applicants and he had no ties to that constituency. In the subsequent Labour landslide Maudling was defeated like many others, although Heston and Isleworth had been expected to be a safe Conservative seat. After its defeat in the 1945 general election, the Conservative Party engaged in an extensive rethink of its policy. Maudling argued that the Party had depended excessively on outdated economic slogans and the popularity of Winston Churchill.

In November 1945, Maudling became the first staff member of the Conservative Parliamentary Secretariat, later the Conservative Research Department, where he was head of the Economic Section. He persuaded the party to accept much of the Labour government&#x27;s nationalisation programme and social services while cutting government spending. In March 1946, Maudling was chosen as the prospective candidate for Barnet, close to his birthplace in Finchley, and began giving speeches there. Labour had unexpectedly won the seat in 1945, but it was considered to be marginal. In 1950, Maudling was elected as Member of Parliament with an absolute majority.

===Member of Parliament and Cabinet===
Following the 1951 election, Churchill made Maudling a junior Minister at the Ministry of Civil Aviation. However, his experience of preparing economic policy led to his speaking on behalf of the Treasury on the 1952 budget and thus to an appointment, later that year, as Economic Secretary to the Treasury. With his mentor Rab Butler as Chancellor of the Exchequer, Maudling worked to reduce taxes and controls in order to move from post-war austerity to affluence. When Anthony Eden took over as prime minister in 1955, Maudling was promoted to head a department as Minister of Supply. He supported the invasion of Suez.

The Ministry was responsible for aircraft production and supplying the armed forces, and Maudling came to agree with critics who argued that it was an unnecessary intermediary; he therefore recommended its abolition. Although supportive of Harold Macmillan&#x27;s appointment as prime minister over the rival claims of Butler in 1957, Maudling found himself in difficulties over his position in the new government. He refused to continue at the Ministry of Supply and also rejected an offer of the Ministry of Health because Iain Macleod, with whom he had a rivalry, had held the post five years earlier and Maudling did not want to be seen as five years behind him.

Macmillan appointed Maudling to the post of Paymaster General and spokesman in the House of Commons for the Ministry of Fuel and Power, which was technically a demotion. Nine months later, Maudling had proved his usefulness; Macmillan brought him into the Cabinet on 17 September 1957, where he acted more as a Minister without Portfolio: he had specific responsibility for persuading the six members of the embryonic European Economic Community, who had recently signed the Treaty of Rome, to abandon their proposal for a customs union in favour of a wider free-trade area where each country would preserve their own external tariffs. However, Maudling&#x27;s lack of international experience led him to underestimate the importance of the nascent Community and what was constructive in it. Faced with widespread rejection of the proposals, Maudling aroused hostility in Bonn and Paris by seeking to play off the Germans against the French.

On 14 November 1958, six months after the election of General de Gaulle as premier, Jacques Soustelle, the French Minister of Information, confirmed to the Press that France would reject the Maudling plan. Two days later, the British delegation to the Community formally called an end to accession negotiations. Maudling later revised his proposals, which were to form the basis of the European Free Trade Association.

Meanwhile, Maudling became an underwriting member of Lloyd&#x27;s of London in December 1957, although his assets were somewhat below average for other &#x27;names&#x27;.

===President of the Board of Trade===
Maudling entered the front line of politics after the 1959 election when appointed President of the Board of Trade. He was responsible for introducing the government&#x27;s proposals to help areas of high unemployment. This was achieved by paying grants to companies to create new plants in these deprived areas, and also by the government taking over unused land for development. Maudling also succeeded in negotiating a free trade agreement between the countries outside the Common Market; this became the European Free Trade Association and was some compensation for his failure to negotiate a free trade area with the Common Market. Maudling was opposed to any proposal to join the Common Market on the basis that it would end Britain&#x27;s right to make commercial agreements with New Zealand and Australia. He was later to remark that &quot;I can think of no more retrograde step economically or politically&quot;. This comment was to be quoted against him when, less than two years later, he was Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time of the reopening of negotiations for Common Market membership.

===Colonial Secretary===
Reginald Maudling was for a short time, as Secretary of State for the Colonies in 1961, responsible for the process of decolonisation. In this position he chaired constitutional conferences for Jamaica, Northern Rhodesia and Trinidad and Tobago which prepared them for independence; his plan for Northern Rhodesia was controversial and he had to threaten resignation before it was approved. However, Maudling was keen to return to economic policy, and seized his opportunity when Macmillan made it clear in private that he supported a voluntary incomes policy. Maudling promptly made his case in public, and three weeks later was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer in Macmillan&#x27;s &quot;Night of the Long Knives&quot; attempt to rejuvenate his Cabinet.

===Chancellor of the Exchequer===
As Chancellor, Maudling soon cut purchase tax and bank interest rates. His 1963 budget aimed at &quot;expansion without inflation&quot;. Following a period of economic difficulty, with a growth target of 4%, Maudling was able to remove income tax from owner-occupiers&#x27; residential premises. He also abolished the rate of duty on home-brewed beer which in effect legalised it. This was the period in which Maudling was at his most popular within the Conservative Party and in the country.

However, later commentators have been less kind to Maudling: Harold Wilson and his Chancellor James Callaghan (who nevertheless sounded out Maudling for the governorship of the Bank of England in 1966) blamed the &quot;dash for growth&quot; that followed the 1963 budget for increasing sterling&#x27;s chronic instability between 1964 and 1967 and by greatly increasing domestic demand the budget certainly exacerbated the existing balance of payments problem. Maudling largely recognised this himself by the time of the 1964 budget and, although he increased taxes, he did little to subdue demand in an election year.

===First unsuccessful leadership bid===
By 1963, during the Profumo affair, there was talk, encouraged by Martin Redmayne (Chief Whip) and Lord Poole (Party Chairman), of Maudling succeeding Macmillan as prime minister. Maudling visited Butler (Deputy Prime Minister) and obtained a mutual promise that they would, if necessary, agree to serve under one another – Maudling believed that he had gained an advantage in obtaining the agreement of Butler, his senior, to serve under him if necessary. William Rees-Mogg claimed in &quot;The Times&quot; on 28 July that Butler led Maudling by 2:1 in the Cabinet, although Maudling had more support amongst backbench MPs.

Macmillan&#x27;s sudden illness and announcement of his resignation in October 1963 came at a time when Maudling&#x27;s support had fallen. He was also poorly received at the Conservative Party conference, which had become a hustings for the leadership, despite coaching from Iain Macleod, in how to deliver his speech. Back in London the following week, a process of &quot;consultation&quot; by Lord Chancellor Dilhorne and by Redmayne declared Foreign Secretary Lord Home, rather than Maudling or Butler, to be the compromise candidate. Enoch Powell, Macleod, Hailsham and Maudling (known as &quot;the Quad&quot; in some accounts of the following days) sought to persuade Butler to refuse to serve under Home, so that Butler rather than Home would have to become prime minister. Macleod and Maudling demanded that Dilhorne lay the results of his consultations before the Cabinet but he refused. Maudling attended the meeting at Powell&#x27;s house late in the evening of 17 October, &quot;well-refreshed&quot; after attending a formal dinner and seems to have &quot;gone along with it&quot; rather than being a ringleader, although he and Hailsham agreed to serve under Butler. On the morning of Saturday 19 October Butler then Maudling agreed to serve under Home, enabling him to accept office as prime minister.

Maudling retained his post as Chancellor under the new prime minister and in the 1964 election, Maudling had a prominent role at the helm of the party&#x27;s daily press conferences, while Douglas-Home toured the country. On the BBC&#x27;s election results programme, the journalist Anthony Howard said that he believed that if Maudling had been leader, the narrow Conservative defeat would have been a narrow Conservative victory. Upon being forced out of the post by the election defeat, Maudling left a note to his successor, James Callaghan, simply stating &quot;Good luck, old cock... Sorry to leave it in such a mess&quot;.

===Second unsuccessful leadership bid===

Out of office, Maudling accepted the offer of a seat on the board of Kleinwort Benson in November 1964, one of the factors which led to his being shifted to spokesman on Foreign Affairs in early 1965. Unlike other potential leadership contenders, Maudling publicly maintained his loyalty to Douglas-Home as criticisms of his leadership mounted. When Douglas-Home resigned, after putting in place a system in which the leadership was directly elected, Maudling fought against Edward Heath for the position of candidate to the party centre-right. 

Unfortunately for Maudling, Enoch Powell also stood, but he was a candidate supporting monetarist and proto-Thatcherite economics, which at that time had little support. Powell won 15 votes. Maudling won 133 votes against Heath&#x27;s 150; Powell&#x27;s 15 votes were seen as more likely to have gone to Maudling had Powell not stood, but they would have made no difference to Heath&#x27;s narrow majority. This was a moment of philosophical instability for the Conservatives. Their historic scepticism of Keynesianism began to grow through the 1960s because there was little to distinguish between the policies of the Conservatives and Labour. The cross-party support for economic planning and union negotiation was becoming increasingly unable to stimulate high levels of economic growth.

Maudling&#x27;s business directorships with Kleinwort Benson and others were mentioned by his opponents as evidence of his lack of commitment for the role, and he was criticised as too close to the Macmillan/Douglas-Home style of politics.

===Deputy Leader and Home Secretary===
Maudling served as Deputy Leader under Heath, and was also a prominent member of the Shadow Cabinet. However, he was neither personally nor politically close to Heath, and as a consequence his influence declined; his support for an incomes policy now went against party policy. He also tended to make gaffes, as for example when he said Harold Wilson had been following the same policy as the Conservatives on Rhodesia and &quot;I can&#x27;t think of anything he has done wrongly&quot;. After Enoch Powell had been sacked from the Shadow Cabinet in 1968 for his controversial &quot;Rivers of Blood&quot; speech, Maudling was moved from the position of Shadow Commonwealth Secretary to become Shadow Defence Secretary until 1969 when he was replaced by Geoffrey Rippon. When the Conservatives returned to power in 1970, Maudling was appointed Home Secretary; the most pressing problem at the Home Office was tackling the Troubles in Northern Ireland. After boarding the aircraft at the end of his first visit to the region, he remarked &quot;For God&#x27;s sake bring me a large Scotch. What a bloody awful country.&quot; When Iain Macleod, who had been appointed as Chancellor in the new Conservative Government, died after barely a month in office, it was reported in &quot;The Glasgow Herald&quot; that Maudling &quot;was being consistently tipped&quot; at Westminster to move from the Home Office back to his old post. Ultimately the post went to Anthony Barber.

Maudling&#x27;s attitude of reassuring calmness in interviews, normally helpful to him, was sometimes damaging. At a 15 December 1971 news conference in Belfast, Maulding said that the British Army had the power to reduce IRA violence to &quot;something which is acceptable&quot;, a remark widely regarded as a gaffe. He also tended to trust the Unionist-controlled Government of Northern Ireland and gloss over differences between their approach and that of the United Kingdom government. This backfired when the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, James Chichester-Clark, resigned when denied the full number of troops he requested in March 1971. That August, Maudling authorised the Northern Ireland government to introduce internment without trial for terror suspects, which caused widespread upheaval and anger among the nationalist population due to its exclusive use on that community, and was followed by an already planned massive escalation in the level of violence.

Regarding criminal justice, Maudling made no attempt, despite his personal support, to reintroduce capital punishment after its abolition in 1969. He introduced Community Service, a new alternative to prison, and in 1971 modestly tightened the immigration rules. He was criticised for ordering the deportation of Rudi Dutschke, a leader of the German student movement. Dutschke, who was in Britain to recuperate from an assassination attempt, was considered a student anarchist.

Maudling was often the target of satirical cartoons in major newspapers, and was lampooned in the magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot; and the television comedy show &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;.

===Bloody Sunday===

After soldiers from the Parachute Regiment shot and killed 14 protestors from a Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) march on 30 January 1972, Maudling gave a statement in the House of Commons, agreeing with statements published by army spokesmen claiming that the regiment had only opened fire in self-defence. Northern Irish politician and MP Bernadette Devlin, who had been present in Derry when the incident occurred, attempted to respond to Maudling&#x27;s statement but was denied by Speaker of the House Selwyn Lloyd; Devlin responded by walking across the commons floor and slapping Maudling. Devlin subsequently told journalists that Maudling&#x27;s statement contained numerous falsehoods and expressed no regrets for the victims of the incident. Eventually, Edward Heath decided to bring in direct rule of Northern Ireland under a separate Secretary of State. In 1974, Shane Paul O&#x27;Doherty, an IRA member, sent Maudling a letter bomb, which slightly injured him.

===Scandal===
In 1972, Maudling&#x27;s business activities were causing considerable disquiet and speculation in the press. In 1966, he had obtained a directorship in the company of John Poulson, an architect Maudling helped obtain lucrative contracts. Poulson routinely did business through bribery and in 1972 was made bankrupt. The bankruptcy hearings disclosed his bribe payments, and Maudling&#x27;s connection became public knowledge. Maudling came to the decision that his responsibility for the Metropolitan Police, which was beginning fraud investigations into Poulson, made his position as Home Secretary untenable. He resigned on 18 July, to general sympathy from the press.

Shortly after receiving Maudling&#x27;s resignation, Edward Heath&#x27;s government performed a &#x27;U-turn&#x27; on economic policy and subsequently adopted an approach strikingly similar to Maudling&#x27;s. Heath advised Maudling not to drop out of the public eye and he continued to make many media appearances. In the year after the Conservative Party&#x27;s electoral defeat in 1974, Heath was replaced as leader by Margaret Thatcher. She appointed Maudling to the post of Shadow Foreign Secretary. However, Maudling clashed with Thatcher over economics, and after less than two years in the role he was dismissed on 19 November 1976. Departing, Maudling summed up his career as &quot;hired by Winston Churchill, fired by Margaret Thatcher&quot;.

==Last years==
In 1969, Maudling had been president of the Real Estate Fund of America, whose chief executive, Jerome Hoffman, had been imprisoned for fraud; Maudling had also been an adviser to the Peachey Property Corporation, whose chairman, Sir Eric Miller, had embezzled company money and later took his own life. He was revealed to have lobbied for more aid to Malta after obtaining a commission for Poulson there, which had led to heavy losses for the Maltese government. These further revelations led to a Parliamentary inquiry into the conduct of Maudling and two other MPs linked to Poulson. This inquiry published its report on 14 July 1977; the report concluded that Maudling had indulged in &quot;conduct inconsistent with the standards which the House is entitled to expect from its members&quot;.

When the report was considered by the House of Commons, the Conservative Party organised its MPs to attend the debate to &quot;Save Reggie&quot;. An amendment was put down to &quot;take note&quot; of the report, instead of endorsing it, and carried by 230 votes (211 Conservatives, 17 Labour, 2 Liberals and 2 Ulster Unionists) to 207. No punishment was imposed. An attempt by backbench Labour MPs to expel Maudling from the House was defeated by 331 votes to 11, and a move to suspend him for six months was lost by 324 to 97.

As Lewis Baston&#x27;s 2004 biography recounts, Maudling and his wife became heavy drinkers once his political career was effectively ended by the scandal. The drinking turned to alcoholism and Maudling&#x27;s health rapidly deteriorated in the late 1970s. He collapsed in early 1979.

==Death==
Maudling died at the Royal Free Hospital in London, from kidney failure and cirrhosis of the liver, on 14 February 1979; he was 61. His body was buried in the churchyard of Little Berkhamsted in Hertfordshire. A stone seat from his garden was placed beside the grave.

==Family life==
Maudling married actress Beryl Laverick (1919–1988) in 1939. They had three sons and a daughter, Caroline Maudling, who became a journalist in the 1960s as the &quot;travelling teenager&quot; of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and, among other things, appeared alongside John Lennon on BBC TV&#x27;s &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot; in 1963.

Maudling&#x27;s mother had disowned him as a result of his marriage, and Maudling did not attend her funeral in 1956. When Caroline aroused comment by having a child out of wedlock in the late 1960s, Maudling was staunch in her defence, publicly expressing paternal pride. Beryl Maudling&#x27;s body was buried next to her husband&#x27;s at Little Berkhamsted.

==In popular culture==
Maudling was portrayed by actor Michael Culkin in the BBC-produced 2018 limited television series &quot;A Very English Scandal&quot;.

<doc id="330755" wikidata="Q5163025" url="?curid=330755" title="Venture Church Network">
<text>Venture Church Network (formerly known as the Conservative Baptist Association of America) is a Baptist Christian association in the United States with each local congregation being autonomous and responsible for their own way of functioning.

==History==
The first organization of Conservative Baptists was the Conservative Baptist Foreign Mission Society (CBFMS), now called WorldVenture, formed in Chicago, in 1943. What became the Venture Church Network was organized in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in 1947 as the Conservative Baptist Association of America. The Conservative Baptist Association emerged as part of the continuing Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy within the Northern Baptist Convention. The forming churches were fundamentalist/conservative churches that had remained in cooperation with the Northern Baptist Convention after other churches had left, such as those that formed the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches. At the 1946 NBC meeting, the old convention made it clear that it would not allow a competing missionary agency to operate within it. Churches withdrew, forming the new association, and hundreds of others withdrew in the following years. The conservatives were in the majority in Minnesota and Arizona, and the Northern Baptists lost those state agencies. The New Testament Association of Independent Churches and the Conservative Baptist Fellowship, which renamed itself the Fundamental Baptist Fellowship and is now the Fundamental Baptist Fellowship International, split from the Conservative Baptists in the 1960s. On February 16, 2021 the association announced it was changing its name to Venture Church Network because the name Conservative Baptist “no longer connects with what it was originally intended to communicate”.
==Constituents==
The movement presently supports three national agencies - Venture Church Network, WorldVenture (formerly CBFMS, then CBInternational), and Missions Door (formerly Conservative Baptist Home Mission Society, then Mission To The Americas). These agencies have omitted the word &quot;baptist&quot; from their names, and it is notable that the four associated educational institutions listed below, likewise have omitted &quot;baptist&quot; from their names also.

Conservative Baptists cooperate with affiliated institutions of higher learning as well as youth and women&#x27;s ministries. Each local Conservative Baptist church is an autonomous organization in voluntary affiliation with each other through regional associations.

==Reorganization==
Until a structural reorganization began in early 2004, Venture Church Network was a network of churches and ministries, committed to evangelization and church planting. In 2003, its membership comprised over 1200 churches representing over 200,000 church members.

Following the dissolution of an Organization Task Force after an unsuccessful attempt to unite the national agencies in a single structure and vision, Venture Church Network was reorganized as “a covenantal fellowship of Regional Associations of Conservative Baptist churches, which have joined together to make the most of the God-given strengths of each member Region for a common purpose.” In 2005 new bylaws were adopted whereby regional associations of local churches are the only members of Venture Church Network; the local churches themselves are members of the regional associations and no longer have any direct participation in the national organization. The regional directors and their boards, as representatives of their member churches, are organizationally and relationally bound through the Covenant of the Regions. The regional directors comprise the Venture Church Network Board, representing the interests of the regions and the member churches of the regions. Venture Church Network is led by a leadership team consisting of the eight regional directors, director of chaplaincy and president (Board Chairman). As of 2021, the staff of Venture Church Network listed on its website were limited to the President, a Director of Chaplaincy, an associate director of Chaplaincy, and an Executive Assistant.

==International ties==
Venture Church Network maintains fellowship and relationship with World Venture, Missions Door and networks of churches in other countries of the world through CBGlobal, which has a board consisting of national organization leaders but no staff of its own.

<doc id="330759" wikidata="Q1420353" url="?curid=330759" title="Good Parliament">
<text>The Good Parliament is the name traditionally given to the English Parliament of 1376. Sitting in London from April 28 to July 10, it was the longest Parliament up until that time.

It took place during a time when the English court was perceived by much of the English population to be corrupt, and its traditional name was due to the sincere efforts by its members to reform the government. It had a formidable enemy, however, in John of Gaunt, fourth son of Edward III and the effective ruler of England at the time.

==In session==
Parliament had not met since November 1373, two and a half years previously, because Edward III and his councillors recognised the danger of calling a parliament during a period of dissatisfaction. 
However, the need for funds was so pressing in 1376 that another parliament was necessary.

Once the members were assembled, they were determined to clean up the corrupt Royal Council. Peter de la Mare, a knight of the shire representing Herefordshire, had been elected as Speaker by the House of Commons, and on the first day he delivered an address criticising England&#x27;s recent military failures, condemning the corruption at court, and calling for close scrutiny of the royal accounts. Richard Lyons (Warden of the Mint) and Lord Latimer, who were believed to be robbing the treasury, were called before Parliament and then imprisoned. Latimer&#x27;s impeachment is the earliest recorded in Parliament. The king&#x27;s mistress, Alice Perrers, was called and condemned to seclusion.

John of Gaunt raised the question of the Salic law, which was the basis for the French case against Edward III&#x27;s claim to the Crown of France, suggesting that the English follow the French custom, but was unable to sway the assembly to his point of view.

Meanwhile, the eldest prince of the realm, Edward the Black Prince, was dying. Having taken a house in London, he summoned both Edward III and John of Gaunt and made them swear to recognise his son, the future Richard II, as successor to Edward. Both John and the King swore to recognise Richard, and soon after Parliament summoned Richard and acknowledged him as heir to the throne. The members were swayed by the immense prestige of Prince Edward, the country&#x27;s greatest military hero at the time.

Parliament then imposed a new set of councillors on the king: Edmund Mortimer, the Earl of March; William Courtenay, Bishop of London; and William of Wykeham, Bishop of Winchester.

Parliament was dissolved in July.

==Aftermath ==
The following autumn, John of Gaunt attempted to undo its work. He barred the admission of the new councillors assigned to the king. He threw Peter de la Mare into prison at Nottingham. He dismissed the new council and recalled Latimer. Alice of Perrers was restored to the company of the king. John also attacked William of Wykeham.

In 1377, John had another parliament convene, the Bad Parliament. John had the Good Parliament declared unconstitutional and its acts removed from the books. Despite this, the public treasured the memory of the reforming parliament, and bestowed upon it the name of the Good Parliament.

<text>Formica exsecta (the narrow-headed ant or excised wood ant) is a species of ant found from Western Europe to Asia.

A rare formicine ant with a deeply excised head, &quot;F. exsecta&quot; forms small mounds up to around a foot in height consisting of much finer material than that used by &quot;true&quot; wood ants of the &quot;F. rufa&quot; group.

An interesting feature of &quot;F. exsecta&quot; is that it occurs in two distinct social forms: either a monogyne form where the colony has a single egg-laying queen, or a polygyne form where many egg-laying queens are part of the same colony.

&quot;F. exsecta&quot; is placed in the &quot;Coptoformica&quot; subgenus within the genus and is closely related to &quot;Formica exsectoides&quot;, an American species. Both species may form vast colony networks. The largest known polydomous system of &quot;F. exsecta&quot; consists of 3,350 nests dispersed over about 22 ha in Transylvania, Romania.

In Great Britain, &quot;F. exsecta&quot; can be found only in a few scattered heathland locations in South West England — principally Chudleigh Knighton Heath and nearby Bovey Heath, which are both managed by the Devon Wildlife Trust, and in the central Scottish Highlands (including Rannoch Moor). A population centre previously existed in the New Forest, and such eminent myrmecologists as Horace Donisthorpe recorded this species there and in Parkhurst Forest on the Isle of Wight in the last century, but this seems to have declined considerably over the past few decades, and recent searches in such locations have failed to find any trace of colonies. The narrow-headed ant is currently one of the target species in the Back from the Brink project, which aims to extend its range in England.

&quot;F. exsecta&quot; has also been found in forests in Sweden, Finland, Germany, Tibet, and China.

==Behavior==

===Sex allocation===
&quot;F. exsecta&quot; is a eusocial species, displaying a dominance hierarchy among its individual colony members. Amongst the narrow-headed ant species, the two different types of colony structure are: monogyny, one queen per colony, and polygyny, more than one queen per colony. Most commonly, one of these two different types is prevalent within a population. These two types of colonies differ not only in the queen&#x27;s mating system, but also in the organization of types of offspring and its hierarchy system. For a polygynous colony to thrive, it must adjust its sex allocation practices contingent on the abundance of resources. Colonies produce a greater percentage of male offspring when restraint on resource availability exists, as well as when the colony has a larger number of queens. The opposite scenario is also found to be true. More female offspring are produced when an abundance of resources exists, as well as when the colony has a smaller number of queens. On average, a colony&#x27;s sex ratio is estimated to be 5.8% female, or one female for every 17.2 male offspring. This heavily male offspring-based sex ratio displays an obvious deviation from Fisher&#x27;s theory of 1:1 sex ratio.

In colonies in which the male offspring are favored, workers tend to execute most of the female gynes. In contrast, colonies where an excess of female gynes is produced, which is more than necessary for the simple act of queen replacement, they are all accepted into the colony to eliminate the possibility of parasitism by unrelated queens from neighboring populations.

===Inbreeding===
In monogynous colonies, a significant amount of inbreeding is found. Inbreeding coefficients were found positive for the workers of these colonies. No inbreeding was found between mother queens. Procreation between related individuals of the colony can be further explained by the queen-male relatedness coefficient of 0.23, found by experiments from Liselotte Sundström. Male offspring that were reared in an inbred colony tended to be smaller in mass. Gynes reared in inbred colony display no difference in mass compared to those in noninbred colonies. This result reflects a trade-off between the quantity of offspring and their reproductive potential. Gynes&#x27; reproductive success is more dependent on their mass than that of a male.

===Fitness and homozygosity===
In single-queen colonies, the level of queen homozygosity is negatively associated with colony age. Reduced colony survival appears to be due to reduced queen lifespan resulting from queen homozygosity.

Worker homozygosity appeared to affect reproductive allocation, with higher homozygosity being associated with less resources being allocated to the sexual brood and more to worker production.

===Haplodiploidy===
&quot;F. exsecta&quot;, much like other insects in the order Hymenoptera, have a haplodiploid sex determination system. An unusual 0.75 relatedness coefficient between full haplodiploid sisters is one of the main contributors to the frequency of evolution of eusocial species. The queen&#x27;s eggs that are fertilized grow into diploid daughters, which contain two pairs of chromosomes, whereas unfertilized eggs produce haploid males, which only contain the queen&#x27;s chromosomes. The voluntary fertilization of eggs is done by the egg-laying mother. Therefore, ideally, the queen&#x27;s best reproductive interest is to lay a larger quantity of eggs or increase the number of eggs that produce individuals that can reproduce themselves. However, female-rich colonies emphasized the production of workers rather than gynes.

<text>The Formicinae are a subfamily within the Formicidae containing ants of moderate evolutionary development.

Formicines retain some primitive features, such as the presence of cocoons around pupae, the presence of ocelli in workers, and little tendency toward reduction of palp or antennal segmentation in most species, except groups. Extreme modification of mandibles is rare, except in the genera &quot;Myrmoteras&quot; and &quot;Polyergus&quot;. However, some members show considerable evolutionary advancement in behaviors such as slave-making and symbiosis with root-feeding hemipterans. Finally, all formicines have very reduced stings and enlarged venom reservoirs, with the venom gland, specialized (uniquely among ants) for the production of formic acid.

All members of the Formicinae &quot;have a one-segmented petiole in the form of a vertical scale&quot;.

==Identification==
Formicine ants have a single node-like or scale-like petiole (postpetiole entirely lacking) and the apex of the abdomen has a circular or U-shaped opening (the acidopore), usually fringed with hairs. A functional sting is absent, and defense is provided by the ejection of formic acid through the acidopore. If the acidopore is concealed by the pygidium and difficult to discern, then the antennal sockets are located well behind the posterior margin of the clypeus (cf. Dolichoderinae). In most formicines, the eyes are well developed (ocelli may also be present), the antennal insertions are not concealed by the frontal carinae, and the promesonotal suture is present and flexible.

The tribal structure of the Formicinae is not completely understood. This list follows the scheme at AntCat, but other schemes and names are used.

<text>The Royal Aero Club (RAeC) is the national co-ordinating body for air sport in the United Kingdom. It was founded in 1901 as the Aero Club of Great Britain, being granted the title of the &quot;Royal Aero Club&quot; in 1910.

==History==
The Aero Club was founded in 1901 by Frank Hedges Butler, his daughter Vera and the Hon Charles Rolls (one of the founders of Rolls-Royce), partly inspired by the Aero Club of France. It was initially concerned more with ballooning but after the demonstrations of heavier-than-air flight made by the Wright Brothers in France in 1908, it embraced the aeroplane. The original club constitution declared that it was dedicated to &#x27;the encouragement of aero auto-mobilism and ballooning as a sport.&#x27; As founded, it was primarily a London gentlemen&#x27;s club, but gradually moved on to a more regulatory role. It had a clubhouse at 119 Piccadilly, which it retained until 1961.

The club was granted its Royal prefix on 15 February 1910. From 1910 the club issued Aviators Certificates, which were internationally recognised under the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (the FAI) to which the club was the UK representative. The club is the governing body in the UK for air sports, as well as for records and competitions.
The club established its first flying ground on a stretch of marshland at Shellbeach near Leysdown on the Isle of Sheppey in early 1909. A nearby farmhouse, Mussell Manor (now called Muswell Manor) became the flying ground clubhouse, and club members could construct their own sheds to accommodate their aircraft. Among the first occupants of the ground were Short Brothers. Two of the brothers, Eustace and Oswald, had previously made balloons for Aero Club members and been appointed the official engineers of the Aero Club. They had also enlisted their eldest brother, Horace, when they decided to begin constructing heavier-than-air aircraft. They acquired a licence to build copies of the Wright aircraft and set up the first aircraft production line in the world at Leysdown.

On 1 May 1909 John Moore-Brabazon (later Lord Brabazon of Tara) made a flight of 500 yards in his Voisin at Shellbeach. This is officially recognised as the first flight by a British pilot in Britain.

The same week the Wright brothers visited the Aero Club flying ground at Shellbeach. After inspecting the Short Brothers&#x27; factory, a photograph was taken outside Mussell Manor of the Wright Brothers with all of the early British aviation pioneers to commemorate their visit to Britain.

In October 1909, the club recognised the Blackpool Aviation Week, making it Britain&#x27;s first official air show. On 30 October Moore-Brabazon was also the first to cover a mile (closed circuit) in a British aeroplane, flying the Short Biplane No. 2, and so winning a prize of £1,000 offered by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; newspaper. On 4 November 1909, he decided to take up a piglet, which he named Icarus the Second, as a passenger, thereby disproving the adage that &quot;pigs can&#x27;t fly&quot;.

It moved the next year to nearby Eastchurch, where the Royal Navy had established a flying school.

Until 1911 the British Military did not have any pilot training facilities. As a result, most early military pilots were trained by members of the club and many became members. By the end of the First World War, more than 6,300 military pilots had taken RAeC Aviator&#x27;s Certificates.

After the loss of its Piccadilly clubhouse in 1961, the club was lodged at the Lansdowne Club at 9 Fitzmaurice Place until 1968. It then moved for a short spell to the Junior Carlton Club&#x27;s modern building at 94 Pall Mall. In June 1973 the club merged with the United Service Club and moved into its premises at 116 Pall Mall. All its aviation-related activities were then transferred to the Aviation Council (United Service and Royal Aero Club) Ltd incorporated on 15 February 1973. In June 1975, the United Service and Royal Aero Club merged with the Naval and Military Club and on 1 August 1975 the Royal Aero Club of the United Kingdom was officially launched and endowed with all its awards, library and memorabilia and took the place of the Aviation Council. By 1977, the club had ceased to be a members club but continued to carry out the function previously carried out by its Aviation Council, with the Secretariat based at the Leicester premises of the British Gliding Association.

Today the Royal Aero Club continues to be the national governing and coordinating body of air sport and recreational flying. The governing bodies of the various forms of sporting aviation (for example British Aerobatic Association) are all members of the Royal Aero Club, which is the UK governing body for international sporting purposes. The Royal Aero Club also acts to support and protect the rights of recreational pilots in the context of national and international regulation.

==First aviator certificates==
The following were the first ten people to gain their aviator certificates from the Royal Aero Club:

# J. T. C. Moore-Brabazon – 8 March 1910

<text>Dashboard Confessional is an American rock band from Boca Raton, Florida, formed in 1999 and led by singer Chris Carrabba. The name of the band is derived from the song &quot;The Sharp Hint of New Tears&quot; off their debut album, &quot;The Swiss Army Romance&quot;.

==History==

===Early history (1999–2002)===
Dashboard Confessional&#x27;s first recording was the 2000 album &quot;The Swiss Army Romance&quot;, initially a solo side project of Chris Carrabba while he was in the band Further Seems Forever. The following year, Further Seems Forever, with Chris Carrabba, recorded its debut album, &quot;The Moon Is Down&quot;. Carrabba left the band before the album was released to record and release his second solo album, &quot;The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most&quot;, and a follow-up EP, &quot;So Impossible&quot;; both were released under the name Dashboard Confessional.

By 2002, three other musicians had joined Dashboard Confessional. After the success of his second album, Carrabba was asked to perform on &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;, and the subsequent live release marked the first time many of the songs were recorded with a full band. Also in 2002, the music video for &quot;Screaming Infidelities&quot; won the MTV2 award at the MTV Video Music Awards, beating out Norah Jones, The Strokes, The Hives, Nappy Roots, and Musiq. This video starred Carrabba in both the performance and the storyline. The video was directed by Maureen Egan and Matthew Barry.

===&quot;A Mark, a Mission, a Brand, a Scar&quot; (2003–2005)===
In 2003, Dashboard Confessional released its third album, &quot;A Mark, a Mission, a Brand, a Scar&quot;. Peaking at No. 2 on the United States &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, the album proved to be the band&#x27;s most commercially viable album yet. In the fall of 2003, Dashboard Confessional toured with Brand New.

In the summer of 2004, Dashboard Confessional recorded the song &quot;Vindicated&quot; for the film &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;. It was featured on the soundtrack and played over the film&#x27;s end credits. Due to such usage, the band gained a sizable audience for their next release the following summer, &quot;Dusk and Summer&quot;. &quot;Vindicated&quot; was not, however, released on &quot;A Mark, a Mission, a Brand, a Scar&quot; but was included on most versions and deluxe edition versions of &quot;Dusk and Summer&quot;.

===&quot;Dusk and Summer&quot; (2005–2006)===
In May 2005, Dashboard Confessional entered the studio to record their fourth album with producer Daniel Lanois. The album, &quot;Dusk and Summer&quot;, was released on June 27, 2006; its first single was &quot;Don&#x27;t Wait&quot;. Following the release of &quot;Dusk and Summer&quot;, Dashboard Confessional went on a summer tour of the U.S. with special guests Say Anything and Ben Lee, followed by co-headlining an arena tour with Brand New.

===&quot;The Shade of Poison Trees&quot; (2007–2009)===
In 2007, Dashboard Confessional released its follow-up to &quot;Dusk and Summer&quot;, &quot;The Shade of Poison Trees.&quot; Unlike its predecessor, this album reflects back on the earlier influence of Carrabba&#x27;s acoustic harmonies from &quot;The Swiss Army Romance&quot; and &quot;The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most&quot;.

===&quot;Alter the Ending, The Swiss Army Romance&quot; re-release (2009–2010)===
Dashboard Confessional began recording their sixth studio album, &quot;Alter the Ending&quot;, in 2008. Carrabba stated that the album could have turned into a concept album:

&quot;...only with the last three has it become, like, &#x27;All right, these have a continuity, and there&#x27;s something going on,&#x27; so I&#x27;m excited to see where that leads.&quot;
On February 14, 2009, as a special Valentine&#x27;s Day gift to fans, Carrabba released a free download on his MySpace page entitled &quot;Even Now (Acoustic Version)&quot; from their forthcoming studio album. In June 2009, the band began &quot;sequencing the album,&quot; suggesting that the upcoming album was close to completion.

In August 2009, Dashboard Confessional contributed a song to the motion picture soundtrack for the dark comedy film &quot;Jennifer&#x27;s Body&quot;, titled &quot;Finishing School.&quot; It was not featured on &quot;Alter the Ending&quot;.

On September 10, 2009, Chris Carrabba confirmed on his Twitter page that the 12-song album would be released on November 10, 2009. It was found out that the album would be released on two discs, the first of which consisted of the full-band version of the album and the second consisted of the acoustic version. In addition, Carrabba stated that Dashboard Confessional would be touring with New Found Glory and Never Shout Never in the near future. On October 30, 2009, however, Carrabba announced via Twitter and Facebook that, due to a last-minute family emergency, the band would be cancelling their &quot;Alter the Ending&quot; tour with New Found Glory and Never Shout Never with the exception of a November 7 concert with the Louisville Orchestra. Although the longer tour with New Found Glory and Never Shout Never was cancelled, Carrabba announced on his website on November 10, 2009, that he and John Lefler would begin a 13-date acoustic tour with New Found Glory (who played acoustic sets as well) on November 30, 2009.

Dashboard Confessional performed as the opening act for the Bon Jovi Circle Tour in 2010. On July 31, 2010, Carrabba performed at the top of Pikes Peak in Colorado for the second annual Love Hope Strength Foundation and Health ONE Pikes Peak Rocks benefit, honoring cancer survivors and raising money and awareness for research and treatment.

On October 4, 2010, it was announced that Dashboard Confessional&#x27;s first album, &quot;The Swiss Army Romance&quot;, would be re-released as a deluxe vinyl album on November 16. The limited edition box set (only 1,000 copies available) included remastered versions of the album&#x27;s track listing, extended artwork, handwritten lyrics, unreleased photos, guitar picks, and a commemorative tour laminate, all encased in an intricate Swiss army knife case. The day after the release, Carrabba embarked on a solo tour playing &quot;The Swiss Army Romance&quot; in its entirety for the tenth anniversary of the release of the album. On December 1, it was announced that Chris Conley of Saves the Day was added to the tour as main support for the West Coast dates. Three-piece band Lady Danville joined them as well.

=== Other pursuits, &quot;Crooked Shadows&quot; (2011–2018) ===
After the release of &quot;Alter the Ending&quot;, Chris Carrabba spent the next few years pursuing many different avenues. In 2011, Chris released &quot;Covered in the Flood&quot;, a solo album containing covers of other artists. Chris spent the subsequent years touring, working on some of his side musical projects, collaborating with other bands and exploring other creative pursuits such as painting and designing clothes.

In an interview with MTV News on October 6, 2017, Chris Carrabba announced that Dashboard Confessional&#x27;s seventh studio album was in the works. On November 15, it was announced that the group&#x27;s next album, &quot;Crooked Shadows&quot;, would be released on February 9, 2018, through Fueled by Ramen.

=== Re-releases, 20th anniversary (2019–2020) ===
In 2019 Dashboard Confessional released re-recordings of &quot;Dusk and Summer&quot;, &quot;Alter the Ending&quot;, and &quot;A Mark, a Mission, a Brand, a Scar&quot; under a triple LP titled &quot;Now Is Then Is Now&quot;.

In 2020, Carrabba and his band started a 20th anniversary tour celebrating the band&#x27;s beginning. The band in the anniversary tour played selected songs from the albums &quot;The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most&quot; and &quot;A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar&quot;. On January 31, 2020, a greatest hits album was released as part of the 20th anniversary titled &quot;The Best Ones of the Best Ones&quot;. The anniversary tour was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

=== &quot;Lonely Hearts &amp; Lovers&quot; Valentine&#x27;s Day Streams (2021–2022) ===
Following Carrabba&#x27;s recovery from a major motorcycle accident in 2020, Dashboard Confessional released a pre-recorded stream show titled &quot;Lonely Hearts &amp; Lovers&quot; on February 14, 2021. They played a 19-song set, shot in Riverside Revival Church in Nashville, Tennessee, in 4K ultra HD. In February 2022, another Valentine&#x27;s stream was announced. This show was shot in gardens in Southern California, and they played 12 songs.

=== &quot;All The Truth That I Can Tell&quot; (2022–present) ===
In February 2022 Dashboard Confessional released their ninth studio album, &quot;All The Truth That I Can Tell&quot;. Dashboard Confessional and Jimmy Eat World began their &#x27;Surviving the Truth Tour&#x27; on February 27, 2022. In early April 2022, Dashboard Confessional announced the Hello Gone Days co-headlining tour with Andrew McMahon In The Wilderness, to kick off on July 31 and last through September 7. Opening acts included Cartel, The Juliana Theory, and Armor for Sleep. Former member John Lefler filled in for Armon Jay for the Dallas show of the tour.

====John Lefler====

John C. Lefler (born March 18, 1975) is an American songwriter, singer, guitarist, and pianist. He is a former member of Dashboard Confessional. Lefler has a been an freelance graphic designer since 2012.

Lefler is from Sugar Land, Texas. He attended Dulles High School and graduated high school in 1993. He attended the University of Texas at Austin and graduated in 1997 with a degree in fine art. Lefler started playing guitar in 1989 and piano shortly thereafter. His first instrument was a PVT-60 which his father had purchased from a pawn shop. He started writing songs when he was about 18 years old, after seeing the John Lennon bio-pic, &quot;Imagine&quot;. Lefler had piano lessons for a few months while in high school. &quot;My recital piece was Bruce Hornsby&#x27;s &quot;The Way It Is&quot;. It was terrible. I&#x27;ve never had another lesson (or recital) of any kind since.&quot; When describing his piano technique, he stated, &quot;I tend to play the piano with my fists more than anything.&quot;

Lefler joined Dashboard Confessional in 2002 after having flown out to meet the rest of the band in Florida. In less than two weeks, Lefler made his first official appearance as a Dashboard Confessional member on the &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; recording. He left on his own accord after the band&#x27;s hiatus began in 2010.

In 2005, Lefler and his brothers Bill and Kevin formed an alternative-country band called The Wimbledons in Los Angeles, California. After much infighting between the brothers, the band completed &quot;The Wimbledons EP&quot; on Lefler&#x27;s own label, Goodhang Records. Being influenced by bands like Jellyfish, Ben Folds, Crowded House, The Police, The Beatles, and U2, Lefler released &quot;Better By Design&quot; in June 2009. &quot;Better By Design&quot; was co-produced by Lefler, along with friends Salim Nourallah and Rip Rowan. In 2012, he released his second EP, &quot;Shoutfire&quot;. It was produced by his brother Bill. Lefler began playing in a yacht rock tribute group Captain and Camille after a 70&#x27;s night at Opening Bell Coffee. He formed the cover group with his friend Camille Cortinas as well as seven local Dallas musicians.

<text>James Stuart Blackton (January 5, 1875 – August 13, 1941) was a British-American film producer and director of the silent era. One of the pioneers of motion pictures, he founded Vitagraph Studios in 1897. He was one of the first filmmakers to use the techniques of stop-motion and drawn animation, is considered a father of American animation, and was the first to bring many classic plays and books to the screen. Blackton was also the commodore of the Motorboat Club of America and the Atlantic Yacht Club.

==Biography==
James Stuart Blackton was born on January 5, 1875, in Sheffield, Yorkshire, England, to Henry Blacktin and Jessie Stuart. Henry Blacktin emigrated with his family to the United States in 1885 and changed the family name to Blackton.

He worked as a reporter and illustrator for the &quot;New York Evening World&quot;, and performed regularly on stage with conjuror Albert Smith. In 1896, Thomas Edison publicly demonstrated the Vitascope, one of the first film projectors, and Blackton was sent to interview Edison and provide drawings of how his films were made. Eager for good publicity, Edison took Blackton to his Black Maria, the special cabin he used to do his filming, and created a film on the spot of Blackton doing a lightning portrait of Edison. The inventor did such a good job selling the art of moviemaking that he talked Blackton and partner Smith into buying a print of the new film, as well as prints of nine other films, plus a Vitascope to show them to paying audiences.
The new act was a great success, despite the various things Blackton and Smith were doing between the Edison films. The next step was to start making films of their own. In this way the American Vitagraph Company was born.

During this period, J. Stuart Blackton ran the Vitagraph studio, and produced, directed, and wrote its films. He even starred in some of his films, playing the comic strip character &quot;Happy Hooligan&quot; in a series of shorts. Since profits were constantly increasing, Blackton felt that he could try any idea that sprang to his head, and in a series of films Blackton developed the concepts of animation.

The first of his animation films is &quot;The Enchanted Drawing&quot;, with a copyright date of 1900 but probably made at least a year earlier. In this film, Blackton sketches a face, a bottle of wine and a glass, a top hat, and a cigar. During the film he appears to remove the wine, glass, hat, and cigar as real objects, and the face appears to react. The &quot;animation&quot; here is of the stop-action variety, where the camera is stopped, a single change is made, and the camera is then started again. The process was first used by Georges Méliès and others.

The transition to stop-motion was apparently accidental, and occurred around 1905. According to Albert Smith, one day the crew was filming a complex series of stop-action effects on the roof while steam from the building&#x27;s generator was billowing in the background. On playing the film back, Smith noticed the odd effect created by the steam puffs scooting across the screen and decided to reproduce it deliberately. A few films (some of which are lost) use this effect to represent invisible ghosts, or to have toys come to life. In 1906, Blackton directed &quot;Humorous Phases of Funny Faces&quot;, which uses stop-motion as well as stick puppetry to produce a series of effects. After Blackton&#x27;s hand draws two faces on a chalkboard, they appear to come to life and engage in antics. Most of the film uses live action effects instead of animation, but nevertheless this film had a huge effect in stimulating the creation of animated films in America. In Europe, the same effect was had from &quot;The Haunted Hotel&quot; (1907), another Vitagraph short directed by Blackton. &quot;The Haunted Hotel&quot; was mostly live-action, about a tourist spending the night in an inn run by invisible spirits. Most of the effects are also live-action (wires and such), but one scene of a dinner making itself was done using stop-motion, and was presented in a tight close-up that allowed budding animators to study it for technique.

Blackton made another animated film that has survived, 1907&#x27;s &quot;Lightning Sketches&quot;, but it has nothing to add to the art of animation. In 1908 he made the first American film version of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, filmed in New York City&#x27;s Central Park and &quot;The Thieving Hand&quot;, filmed in Flatbush, Brooklyn. By 1909, Blackton was too absorbed in the business of running Vitagraph to have time for filmmaking. He came to regard his animation experiments in particular as being rather juvenile (they receive no mention in his unpublished autobiography).

===Dramatic films and later life===

Stuart Blackton believed that the US should join the Allies involved in World War I overseas and in 1915 produced &quot;The Battle Cry of Peace&quot;. Former President Theodore Roosevelt was one of the film&#x27;s staunchest supporters and convinced Gen. Leonard Wood to loan Blackton an entire regiment of marines to use as extras. Upon its release, the film generated a controversy rivaling that of &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; because it was considered as militaristic propaganda.

Blackton left Vitagraph to go independent in 1917, but returned in 1923 as junior partner to Albert Smith. In 1925, Smith sold the company to Warner Brothers for more than $1 million.

Blackton did quite well with his share until the Stock Market Crash of 1929, which destroyed his savings and made him bankrupt in 1931. He spent his last years on the road, showing his old films and lecturing about the days of silent movies. His daughter Violet Virginia Blackton (1910–1965) married writer Cornell Woolrich in 1930 but their marriage was annulled in 1933.

He married actress Evangeline Russell in 1936.

Blackton died August 13, 1941, a few days after he suffered a fractured skull after being hit by a motorist while crossing the street with his son. At the time of his death he was working for Hal Roach on experiments to improve color process backgrounds. Blackton was cremated and interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

<doc id="330775" wikidata="Q1067131" url="?curid=330775" title="History of New York City">
<text>The written history of New York City began with the first European explorer, the Italian Giovanni da Verrazzano in 1528. European settlement began with the Dutch in 1608 and New Amsterdam was founded in 1624.

The &quot;Sons of Liberty&quot; campaigned against British authority in New York City, and the Stamp Act Congress of representatives from throughout the Thirteen Colonies met in the city in 1765 to organize resistance to Crown policies. The city&#x27;s strategic location and status as a major seaport made it the prime target for British seizure in 1776. General George Washington lost a series of battles from which he narrowly escaped (with the notable exception of the Battle of Harlem Heights, his first victory of the war), and the British Army occupied New York and made it their base on the continent until late 1783, attracting Loyalist refugees.

The city served as the national capital under the Articles of Confederation from 1785 to 1789, and briefly served as the new nation&#x27;s capital in 1789–90 under the United States Constitution. Under the new government, the city hosted the inauguration of George Washington as the first President of the United States, the drafting of the United States Bill of Rights, and the first Supreme Court of the United States. The opening of the Erie Canal New York and the Great Lakes, along with coastal traffic to lower New England, making the city the preeminent port on the Atlantic Ocean. The arrival of rail connections to the north and west in the 1840s and 1850s strengthened its central role.

Beginning in the mid-19th century, waves of new immigrants arrived from Europe dramatically changing the composition of the city and serving as workers in the expanding industries. Modern New York traces its development to the consolidation of the five boroughs in 1898 and an economic and building boom following the Great Depression and World War II. Throughout its history, New York has served as a main port of entry for many immigrants, and its cultural and economic influence has made it one of the most important urban areas in the United States and the world. The economy in the 1700s was based on farming, local production, fur trading, and Atlantic jobs like shipbuilding. In the 1700s, New York was sometimes referred to as a breadbasket colony, because one of its major crops was wheat. New York colony also exported other goods included iron ore as a raw material and as manufactured goods such as tools, plows, nails and kitchen items such as kettles, pans and pots.

==Native American settlement==

Prior to the first human settlement, the area that eventually encompassed modern day New York was originally a marshland swamp, with numerous streams and creeks throughout modern day Manhattan Island. The first human Inhabitants were by the Lenape people. These groups of culturally and linguistically related Native Americans traditionally spoke an Algonquian language now referred to as &quot;Unami&quot;. Early European settlers called bands of Lenape by the Unami place name for where they lived, such as &quot;Raritan&quot; in Staten Island and New Jersey, &quot;Canarsee&quot; in Brooklyn, and &quot;Hackensack&quot; in New Jersey across the Hudson River from Lower Manhattan. Some modern place names such as Raritan Bay and Canarsie are derived from Lenape names. Eastern Long Island neighbors were culturally and linguistically more closely related to the Mohegan-Pequot peoples of New England who spoke the Mohegan-Montauk-Narragansett language.

These peoples made use of the abundant waterways in the New York region for fishing, hunting trips, trade, and occasionally war. Many paths created by the indigenous peoples are now main thoroughfares, such as Broadway in Manhattan, the Bronx, and Westchester. The Lenape developed sophisticated techniques of hunting and managing their resources. By the time of the arrival of Europeans, they were cultivating fields of vegetation through the slash and burn technique, which extended the productive life of planted fields. They also harvested vast quantities of fish and shellfish from the bay. Historians estimate that at the time of European settlement, approximately 5,000 Lenape lived in 80 settlements around the region.

==European exploration and settlement==
===New Angoulême===

The first European visitor to the area was Giovanni da Verrazzano, an Italian in command of the French ship &quot;La Dauphine&quot; in 1524. It is believed he sailed into Upper New York Bay, where he encountered native Lenape, returned through the Narrows, where he anchored the night of April 17, and left to continue his voyage. He named the area New Angoulême (&quot;La Nouvelle-Angoulême&quot;) in honor of Francis I, King of France of the royal house of Valois-Angoulême and who had been Count of Angoulême from 1496 until his coronation in 1515. The name refers to the town of Angoulême, in the Charente département of France. For the next century, the area was occasionally visited by fur traders or explorers, such as by Esteban Gomez in 1525.

European exploration continued on September 2, 1609, when the Englishman Henry Hudson, in the employ of the Dutch East India Company, sailed the &quot;Half Moon&quot; through the Narrows into Upper New York Bay. Like Christopher Columbus, Hudson was looking for a westerly passage to Asia. He never found one, but he did take note of the abundant beaver population. Beaver pelts were in fashion in Europe, fueling a lucrative business. Hudson&#x27;s report on the regional beaver population served as the impetus for the founding of Dutch trading colonies in the New World. The beaver&#x27;s importance in New York&#x27;s history is reflected by its use on the city&#x27;s official seal.

===Dutch settlement===

The first Dutch fur trading posts and settlements were in 1614 near present-day Albany, New York, the same year that New Netherland first appeared on maps. Only in May 1624 did the Dutch West India Company land a number of families at &quot;Noten Eylant&quot; (today&#x27;s Governors Island) off the southern tip of Manhattan at the mouth of the North River (today&#x27;s Hudson River). Soon thereafter, most likely in 1626, construction of Fort Amsterdam began. Later, the Dutch West Indies Company imported African slaves to serve as laborers; they were forced to build the wall that defended the town against English and Indian attacks. Early directors included Willem Verhulst and Peter Minuit. Willem Kieft became director in 1638 but five years later was embroiled in Kieft&#x27;s War against the Native Americans. The Pavonia Massacre, across the Hudson River in present-day Jersey City, resulted in the death of 80 natives in February 1643. Following the massacre, Algonquian tribes joined forces and nearly defeated the Dutch. Holland sent additional forces to the aid of Kieft, leading to the overwhelming defeat of the Native Americans and a peace treaty on August 29, 1645.
On May 27, 1647, Peter Stuyvesant was inaugurated as director general upon his arrival and ruled as a member of the Dutch Reformed Church. The colony was granted self-government in 1652, and New Amsterdam was incorporated as a city on February 2, 1653. The first mayors (&quot;burgemeesters&quot;) of New Amsterdam, Arent van Hattem and Martin Cregier, were appointed in that year. By the early 1660s, the population consisted of approximately 1500 Europeans, only about half of whom were Dutch, and 375 Africans, 300 of whom were slaves.

A few of the original Dutch place names have been retained, most notably Flushing (after the Dutch town of Vlissingen), Harlem (after Haarlem), and Brooklyn (after Breukelen). Few buildings, however, remain from the 17th century. The oldest recorded house still in existence in New York, the Pieter Claesen Wyckoff House in Brooklyn, dates from 1652.

===English rule: 1664–1783===

On August 27, 1664, four English frigates under the command of Col. Richard Nicolls sailed into New Amsterdam&#x27;s harbor and demanded New Netherland&#x27;s surrender, as part of an effort by King Charles II&#x27;s brother James, Duke of York, the Lord High Admiral to provoke the Second Anglo-Dutch War. Two weeks later, Stuyvesant officially capitulated by signing Articles of Surrender and in June 1665, the town was reincorporated under English law and renamed &quot;New York&quot; after the Duke, and Fort Orange was renamed &quot;Fort Albany&quot;. The war ended in a Dutch victory in 1667, but the colony remained under English rule as stipulated in the Treaty of Breda. During the Third Anglo-Dutch War, the Dutch briefly recaptured the city in 1673, renaming the city &quot;New Orange&quot;, before permanently ceding the colony of New Netherland to England for what is now Suriname in November 1674 at the Treaty of Westminster.

The colony benefited from increased immigration from Europe and its population grew faster. The Bolting Act of 1678, whereby no mill outside the city was permitted to grind wheat or corn, boosted growth until its repeal in 1694, increasing the number of houses over the period from 384 to 983.

In the context of the Glorious Revolution in England, Jacob Leisler led Leisler&#x27;s Rebellion and effectively controlled the city and surrounding areas from 1689 to 1691, before being arrested and executed.

====Lawyers====
In New York at first, legal practitioners were full-time businessmen and merchants, with no legal training, who had watched a few court proceedings, and mostly used their own common sense together with snippets they had picked up about English law. Court proceedings were quite informal, for the judges had no more training than the attorneys.

By the 1760s, the situation had dramatically changed. Lawyers were essential to the rapidly growing international trade, dealing with questions of partnerships, contracts, and insurance. The sums of money involved were large, and hiring an incompetent lawyer was a very expensive proposition. Lawyers were now professionally trained, and conversant in an extremely complex language that combined highly specific legal terms and motions with a dose of Latin. Court proceedings became a baffling mystery to the ordinary layman. Lawyers became more specialized and built their reputation, and their fee schedule, on the basis of their reputation for success. But as their status, wealth and power rose, animosity grew even faster. By the 1750s and 1760s, there was a widespread attack ridiculing and demeaning the lawyers as pettifoggers (lawyers lacking sound legal skills). Their image and influence declined. The lawyers organized a bar association, but it fell apart in 1768 during the bitter political dispute between the factions based in the Delancey and Livingston families. A large fraction of the prominent lawyers were Loyalists; their clientele was often to royal authority or British merchants and financiers. They were not allowed to practice law unless they took a loyalty oath to the new United States of America. Many went to Britain or Canada (primarily to New Brunswick and Nova Scotia) after losing the war.

For the next century, various attempts were made, and failed, to build an effective organization of lawyers. Finally a Bar Association emerged in 1869 that proved successful and continues to operate.

====Native Americans and Enslaved People====

By 1700, the Lenape population of New York had diminished to 200. The Dutch West Indies Company transported African slaves to the post as trading laborers used to build the fort and stockade, and some gained freedom under the Dutch. After the seizure of the colony in 1664, the slave trade continued to be legal. In 1703, 42% of the New York households had slaves; they served as domestic servants and laborers but also became involved in skilled trades, shipping and other fields. Yet following reform in ethics according to American Enlightenment thought, by the 1770s slaves made up less than 25% of the population.

By the 1740s, 20% of the residents of New York were slaves, totaling about 2,500 people.

After a series of fires in 1741, the city panicked over rumors of its black population conspiring with some poor whites to burn the city. Historians believe their alarm was mostly fabrication and fear, but officials rounded up 31 black and 4 white people, who over a period of months were convicted of arson. Of these, the city executed 13 black people by burning them alive and hanged the remainder of those incriminated.

In 1754, Columbia University was founded under charter by King George II as King&#x27;s College in Lower Manhattan.

====American Revolution====
The Stamp Act and other British measures fomented dissent, particularly among Sons of Liberty who maintained a long-running skirmish with locally stationed British troops over Liberty Poles from 1766 to 1776. The Stamp Act Congress met in New York City in 1765 in the first organized resistance to British authority across the colonies. After the major defeat of the Continental Army in the Battle of Long Island in late 1776, General George Washington withdrew to Manhattan Island, but with the subsequent defeat at the Battle of Fort Washington the island was effectively left to the British. The city became a haven for loyalist refugees, becoming a British stronghold for the entire war. Consequently, the area also became the focal point for Washington&#x27;s espionage and intelligence-gathering throughout the war.

New York was greatly damaged twice by fires of suspicious origin, with the Loyalists and Patriots accusing each other of starting the conflagration. The city became the political and military center of operations for the British in North America for the remainder of the war. Continental Army officer Nathan Hale was hanged in Manhattan for espionage. In addition, the British began to hold the majority of captured American prisoners of war aboard prison ships in Wallabout Bay, across the East River in Brooklyn. More Americans lost their lives aboard these ships than died in all the battles of the war. The British occupation lasted until November 25, 1783. George Washington triumphantly returned to the city that day, as the last British forces left the city.

===Federal and early America: 1784–1854===

Starting in 1785 the Congress met in the city of New York under the Articles of Confederation. In 1789, New York became the first national capital under the new Constitution. The Constitution also created the current Congress of the United States, and its first sitting was at Federal Hall on Wall Street. The first Supreme Court sat there. The United States Bill of Rights was drafted and ratified there. George Washington was inaugurated at Federal Hall. New York remained the national capital until 1790, when the role was transferred to Philadelphia.

During the 19th century, the city was transformed by immigration, a visionary development proposal called the Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811 which expanded the city street grid to encompass all of Manhattan, and the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825, which connected the Atlantic port to the vast agricultural markets of the Midwestern United States and Canada. By 1835, New York had surpassed Philadelphia as the largest city in the United States. New York grew as an economic center, first as a result of Alexander Hamilton&#x27;s policies and practices as the first Secretary of the Treasury.

In 1842, water was piped from a reservoir to supply the city for the first time.

The Great Irish Famine (1845–1850) brought a large influx of Irish immigrants, and by 1850 the Irish comprised one quarter of the city&#x27;s population. Government institutions, including the New York City Police Department and the public schools, were established in the 1840s and 1850s to respond to growing demands of residents. In 1831, New York University was founded by U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin as a non-denominal institution surrounding Washington Square Park.

==Modern history==

===Tammany and consolidation: 1855–1897===

This period started with the 1855 inauguration of Fernando Wood as the first mayor from Tammany Hall. It was the political machine based among Irish Americans that controlled the local Democratic Party. It usually dominated local politics throughout this period and into the 1930s. Public-minded members of the merchant community pressed for a Central Park, which was opened to a design competition in 1857; it became the first landscape park in an American city.

During the American Civil War (1861–1865), the city was affected by its history of strong commercial ties to the South; before the war, half of its exports were related to cotton, including textiles from upstate mills. Together with its growing immigrant population, which was angry about conscription, sympathies among residents were divided for both the Union and Confederacy at the outbreak of war. Tensions related to the war culminated in the Draft Riots of 1863 led by Irish Catholics, who attacked black neighborhood and abolitionist homes. Many blacks left the city and moved to Brooklyn. After the Civil War, the rate of immigration from Europe grew steeply, and New York became the first stop for millions seeking a new and better life in the United States, a role acknowledged by the dedication of the Statue of Liberty in 1886.

===Early 20th century: 1898–1945===


From 1890 to 1930, the largest cities, led by New York, were the focus of international attention. The skyscrapers and tourist attractions were widely publicized. Suburbs were emerging as bedroom communities for commuters to the central city. San Francisco dominated the West, Atlanta dominated the South, Boston dominated New England; Chicago dominated the Midwest United States. New York City dominated the entire nation in terms of communications, trade, finance, popular culture, and high culture. More than a fourth of the 300 largest corporations in 1920 were headquartered here.

In 1898, the modern City of New York was formed with the consolidation of Brooklyn (until then an independent city), Manhattan, and outlying areas. Manhattan and the Bronx were established as two separate boroughs and joined with three other boroughs created from parts of adjacent counties to form the new municipal government originally called &quot;Greater New York&quot;. The Borough of Brooklyn incorporated the independent City of Brooklyn, recently joined to Manhattan by the Brooklyn Bridge; the Borough of Queens was created from western Queens County (with the remnant established as Nassau County in 1899); and the Borough of Richmond contained all of Richmond County. Municipal governments contained within the boroughs were abolished, and the county governmental functions were absorbed by the city or each borough. In 1914, the New York State Legislature created Bronx County, making five counties coterminous with the five boroughs.

The Bronx had a steady boom period during 1898–1929, with a population growth by a factor of six from 200,000 in 1900 to 1.3 million in 1930. The Great Depression created a surge of unemployment, especially among the working class, and a slow-down of growth.

On June 15, 1904, over 1,000 people, mostly German immigrant women and children, were killed when the excursion steamship &quot;General Slocum&quot; caught fire and sank. It is the city&#x27;s worst maritime disaster. On March 25, 1911, the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in Greenwich Village took the lives of 146 garment workers. In response, the city made great advancements in the fire department, building codes, and workplace regulations.

Throughout the first half of the 20th century, the city became a world center for industry, commerce, and communication, marking its rising influence with such events as the Hudson-Fulton Celebration of 1909. Interborough Rapid Transit (the first New York City Subway company) began operating in 1904, and the railroads operating out of Grand Central Terminal and Pennsylvania Station thrived.

From 1918 to 1920, New York City was affected by the largest rent strike wave in its history. Somewhere between several tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of tenants went on strike across the city. A WW1 housing and coal shortage sparked the strikes. It became marked both by occasional violent scuffles and the Red Scare. It would lead to the passage of the first rent laws in the nation&#x27;s history.
The city was a destination for internal migrants as well as immigrants. Through 1940, New York was a major destination for African Americans during the Great Migration from the rural American South. The Harlem Renaissance flourished during the 1920s and the era of Prohibition. New York&#x27;s ever accelerating changes and rising crime and poverty rates were reduced after World War I disrupted trade routes, the Immigration Restriction Acts limited additional immigration after the war, and the Great Depression reduced the need for new labor. The combination ended the rule of the Gilded Age barons. As the city&#x27;s demographics temporarily stabilized, labor unionization helped the working class gain new protections and middle-class affluence, the city&#x27;s government and infrastructure underwent a dramatic overhaul under Fiorello La Guardia, and his controversial parks commissioner, Robert Moses, ended the blight of many tenement areas, expanded new parks, remade streets, and restricted and reorganized zoning controls.

For a while, New York ranked as the most populous city in the world, overtaking London in 1925, which had reigned for a century. During the difficult years of the Great Depression, the reformer Fiorello La Guardia was elected as mayor, and Tammany Hall fell after eighty years of political dominance.

Despite the effects of the Great Depression, some of the world&#x27;s tallest skyscrapers were built during the 1930s. Art Deco architecture—such as the iconic Chrysler Building, Empire State Building, and 30 Rockefeller Plaza— came to define the city&#x27;s skyline. The construction of the Rockefeller Center occurred in the 1930s and was the largest-ever private development project at the time. Both before and especially after World War II, vast areas of the city were also reshaped by the construction of bridges, parks and parkways coordinated by Robert Moses, the greatest proponent of automobile-centered modernist urbanism in America.

===Post–World War II: 1946–1977===

Returning World War II veterans and immigrants from Europe created a postwar economic boom. Demands for new housing were aided by the G.I. Bill for veterans, stimulating the development of huge suburban tracts in eastern Queens and Nassau County. The city was extensively photographed during the post–war years by photographer Todd Webb.

New York emerged from the war as the leading city of the world, with Wall Street leading the United States ascendancy. In 1951, the United Nations relocated from its first headquarters in Flushing Meadows Park, Queens, to the East Side of Manhattan. During the late 1960s, the views of real estate developer and city leader Robert Moses began to fall out of favor as the anti-urban renewal views of Jane Jacobs gained popularity. Citizen rebellion stopped a plan to construct an expressway through Lower Manhattan.

After a short war boom, the Bronx declined from 1950 to 1985, going from predominantly moderate-income to mostly lower-income, with high rates of violent crime and poverty. The Bronx has experienced an economic and developmental resurgence starting in the late 1980s that continues into today.

The transition away from the industrial base toward a service economy picked up speed, while the jobs in the large shipbuilding and garment industries declined sharply. The ports converted to container ships, costing many traditional jobs among longshoremen. Many large corporations moved their headquarters to the suburbs or to distant cities. At the same time, there was enormous growth in services, especially finance, education, medicine, tourism, communications and law. New York remained the largest city and largest metropolitan area in the United States, and continued as its largest financial, commercial, information, and cultural center.

Like many major U.S. cities, New York suffered race riots, gang wars and some population decline in the late 1960s. Street activists and minority groups such as the Black Panthers and Young Lords organized rent strikes and garbage offensives, demanding improved city services for poor areas. They also set up free health clinics and other programs, as a guide for organizing and gaining &quot;Power to the People.&quot; By the 1970s the city had gained a reputation as a crime-ridden relic of history. In 1975, the city government avoided bankruptcy only through a federal loan and debt restructuring by the Municipal Assistance Corporation, headed by Felix Rohatyn. The city was also forced to accept increased financial scrutiny by an agency of New York State. In 1977, the city was struck by the New York City blackout of 1977 and serial slayings by the Son of Sam. Ed Koch became mayor in 1978.

===1978–present===


The 1980s began a rebirth of Wall Street, and the city reclaimed its role at the center of the worldwide financial industry. Unemployment and crime remained high, the latter reaching peak levels in some categories around the close of the decade and the beginning of the 1990s. Neighborhood restoration projects funded by the city and state had very good effects for New York, especially Bedford-Stuyvesant, Harlem, and The Bronx. The city later resumed its social and economic recovery, bolstered by the influx of Asians, Latin Americans, and U.S. citizens, and by new crime-fighting techniques on the part of the New York Police Department. In 1989, David Dinkins became the city&#x27;s first Black mayor. He came out of the Gang of Four. 

Rudy Giuliani became mayor in 1994. In the late 1990s, the city benefited from the nationwide fall of violent crime rates, the resurgence of the finance industry, and the growth of the &quot;Silicon Alley&quot;, during the dot com boom, one of the factors in a decade of booming real estate values. New York was also able to attract more business and convert abandoned industrialized neighborhoods into arts or attractive residential neighborhoods; examples include the Meatpacking District and Chelsea (in Manhattan) and Williamsburg (in Brooklyn).

New York&#x27;s population reached an all-time high in the 2000 census; according to census estimates since 2000, the city has continued to grow, including rapid growth in the most urbanized borough, Manhattan. During this period, New York City was a site of the September 11 attacks of 2001; 2,606 people who were in the towers and in the surrounding area were killed by a terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, an event considered highly traumatic for the city but which did not stop the city&#x27;s rapid regrowth. On November 3, 2014, One World Trade Center opened on the site of the attack. 

Michael Bloomberg became mayor in 2002. The Occupy Wall Street protest movement happened in New York City in 2011. Hurricane Sandy brought a destructive storm surge to New York in the evening of October 29, 2012, flooding numerous streets, tunnels, and subway lines in Lower Manhattan. It flooded low-lying areas of Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. Electrical power was lost in many parts of the city and its suburbs. 

Bill de Blasio became mayor in 2014. The city went into lockdown in March 2020 amidst the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. , New York City had experienced the most deaths of any locality in the coronavirus pandemic in New York state, which itself has the highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases of any state in the United States. During the first wave, one-third of total known U.S. cases were in New York City. 

Eric Adams became mayor in 2022. In 2024, Adams became the first New York City mayor to be indicted on criminal charges. He has been federally charged with corruption and bribery.

<text>The Regina Rams represent the University of Regina, located in Regina, Saskatchewan, in the sport of Canadian football in U Sports. The Rams joined U Sports in 1999 and have competed in the Canada West Conference since then. The program has won two U Sports football conference championships, in 2000 and 2024, and the team has made one appearance in the Vanier Cup championship game.

The Rams nickname is used by the university&#x27;s football team only; all of the other teams at the school are named the Regina Cougars.

==Club history==
The Regina Rams were formed in 1954 when two junior football teams, the Bombers and the Dales, merged into one football club. The Rams participated in the Man-Sask Junior Football League until 1976, when they joined with junior teams from Alberta to form the Prairie Football Conference. The club would participate in the CJFL until 1998, winning ten Canadian Junior Football Championships along the way.

In 1999, after competing for 45 years in junior football (Canadian Junior Football League), the Regina Rams became a member of the Canada West Conference of the Canadian Intercollegiate Athletic Union (CIAU), later Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS) and now U Sports. The University of Regina came to community partnership agreement with the CJFL team that made the transfer possible. Rather than change their name to Regina Cougars, the football team continued to use the moniker &quot;Rams.&quot; In only their second year of playing in the CIAU, the Rams won the Canada West Conference championship and then the Atlantic Bowl. They then went on their way to the Vanier Cup where they lost 42–39 to Marcel Bellefeuille&#x27;s Ottawa Gee-Gees in the 36th Vanier Cup.
Frank McCrystal was the head coach of the Rams from their inception in the CIS until 2014. He took the reins of the team in 1984, making 2014 his 31st season as head coach of the Rams and his 16th in the CIS. In 2007, after leading his team to a 6–2 regular season record and an appearance in the Hardy Cup game, McCrystal was named Canadian Interuniversity Sport Coach of the Year and received the 2007 Frank Tindall Trophy.

The Rams played the inaugural sporting event at Mosaic Stadium on October 1, 2016, hosting the University of Saskatchewan Huskies. At the end of the 2016 season, quarterback Noah Picton became the first Rams player to win the Hec Crighton Trophy after completing 224 passes out of 323 attempts for 3,186 yards with 25 touchdowns and nine interceptions. That was also the first season that the Rams finished in first place in the Canada West regular season.

==CIAU/CIS/U Sports Regular Season Results==

*(*)The Rams forfeited three wins in 2018 due to use of an ineligible player. Those games were then awarded as 1–0 wins to Alberta, UBC, and Manitoba.

== National U Sports Postseason Results ==

Regina is 1–1 in national semi-final games and 0–1 in the Vanier Cup.

==Head coaches==
==Regina Rams in the professional ranks==

As of the end of the 2024 CFL season, six former Rams players were on CFL teams&#x27; rosters:
*Jaxon Ford, Saskatchewan Roughriders
*Jorgen Hus, Saskatchewan Roughriders
*Mitchell Picton, Saskatchewan Roughriders
*Tanner Schmekel, Winnipeg Blue Bombers
*Richard Sindani, Toronto Argonauts
*Ryder Varga, BC Lions

<doc id="330785" wikidata="Q461282" url="?curid=330785" title="Yi people">
<text>The Yi or Nuosu people (Nuosu: , ; see also § Names and subgroups) are an ethnic group in southern China. Numbering nine million people, they are the seventh largest of the 55 ethnic minority groups recognized by the Chinese government. They live primarily in rural areas of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi, usually in mountainous regions. The Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture is home to the largest population of Yi people within China, with two million Yi people in the region. In neighbouring Vietnam, , there are 4,827 Lô Lô people (a subgroup of the Yi) living in the Hà Giang, Cao Bằng, and Lào Cai provinces, in the country&#x27;s north.

The Yi speak various Loloish languages, closely related to Burmese. The prestige variety is Nuosu, which is written in the Yi script.

==Location==
Of the more than 9 million Yi people, over 4.5 million live in Yunnan Province, 2.5 million live in southern Sichuan Province and 1 million live in the northwest corner of Guizhou Province. Nearly all the Yi live in mountainous areas, often carving out their existence on the sides of steep mountain slopes far from the cities of China.

The altitudinal differences of the Yi areas directly affect the climate and precipitation of these areas. These striking differences are the basis of the old saying that &quot;The weather is different a few miles away&quot; in the Yi area. Yi populations in different areas are very different from one another, making their living in completely different ways.

==Names and subgroups==
Although different groups of Yi refer to themselves in different ways (including Nisu, Sani, Axi, Lolo, and Acheh) and sometimes speak mutually unintelligible languages, they have been grouped into a single ethnicity by the Chinese and the various local appellations can be classified into three groups:
*Ni (). The appellations of Nuosu, Nasu, Nesu, Nisu and other similar names are considered derivatives of the original autonym &quot;Nip&quot; () appended with the suffix &quot;-su&quot;, indicating &#x27;people&#x27;. The name &quot;Sani&quot; is also a variety of this group. Further, it is widely believed that the Chinese name &quot;Yí&quot; (both and ) were derived from Ni.
*Lolo. The appellations of Lolo, Lolopu, etc. are related to the Yi people&#x27;s worship of the tiger, as &quot;lo&quot; in their dialects means &#x27;tiger&#x27;. &quot;Lo&quot; is also the basis for the Chinese exonym &quot;Luóluó&quot; (, or ). The original character (), with the &quot;dog radical&quot; () and a &quot;guǒ&quot; () phonetic, was a graphic pejorative, comparable to the Chinese name &quot;guǒran&quot; (, &#x27;a long-tailed ape&#x27;). Languages reforms in the PRC replaced the character in &quot;Luóluó&quot; twice—first by &quot;Luó&quot; (), with the &quot;human radical&quot; () and the same phonetic, but that was a graphic variant for &quot;luǒ&quot; (, &#x27;naked&#x27;), and later by &quot;Luó&quot; (, &#x27;net for catching birds&#x27;). Paul K. Benedict noted, &quot;a leading Chinese linguist, has remarked that the name &#x27;Lolo&#x27; &quot;is offensive only when written with the &#x27;dog&#x27; radical&quot;.&quot;
*Other. This group includes various other appellations of different groups of Yi. Some of them may be of other ethnic groups but are recognised as Yi by the Chinese. The &quot;Pu&quot; may be relevant to an ancient ethnic group Pu (). In the legends of the Northern Yi, the Yi people conquered Pu and its territory in the northeastern part of the modern Liangshan.

Groups listed below are sorted by their broad linguistic classification and the general geographic area where they live. Within each section, larger groups are listed first.

==History==


===Origin myth===
According to Yi legend, all life originated in water and water was created by snowmelt, which as it dripped down, created a creature called the Ni. The Ni gave birth to all life. Ni is another name for the Yi people. It is sometimes translated as black because black is a revered color in Yi culture. Yi tradition tells us that their common ancestor was named Apu Dumu or (&quot;Axpu Ddutmu&quot; or &quot;Axpu Jjutmu&quot;). Apu Dumu had three wives, each of whom had two sons. The six sons migrated to the area that is now Zhaotong and spread out in the four directions, creating the Wu, Zha, Nuo, Heng, Bu, and Mo clans. The Yi practiced a lineage system where younger brothers were treated as slaves by their elders, which resulted in a culture of migration where younger brothers constantly left their villages to create their own domains.

===Guizhou kingdoms===
The Heng clan divided into two branches. One branch, known as the Wumeng, settled along the western slope of the Wumeng Mountain range, extending their control as far west as modern day Zhaotong, Yunnan. The other branch, known as the Chele, moved along the eastern slope of the Wumeng Mountain range and settled to the north of the Chishui River. By the Tang dynasty (618–907), the Chele occupied the area from today Xuyong county in Sichuan to Bijie city in Guizhou. The Bu clan fragmented into four branches. The Bole branch settled in Anshun, the Wusa branch settled in Weining, the Azouchi branch settled in Zhanyi, and the Gukuge branch settled in northeast Yunnan. The Mo clan, descended from Mujiji (), split into three branches. One branch known as the Awangren, led by Wualou, settled in southwest Guizhou and formed the Ziqi Kingdom. Wuake led the second branch, the Ayuxi, to settle near Ma&#x27;an Mountain south of Huize. Wuana led the third branch to settle in Hezhang. In the 3rd century AD, Wuana&#x27;s branch split into the Mangbu branch in Zhenxiong, led by Tuomangbu, and Luodian () in Luogen, led by Tuoazhe. By 300, Luodian covered over much of the Shuixi region. Its ruler, Moweng (), moved the capital to Mugebaizhage (modern Dafang), where he renamed his realm the Mu&#x27;ege kingdom, otherwise known as the Chiefdom of Shuixi.

After the Eastern Han dynasty, the Shu of the Three Kingdoms conducted several wars against the ancestors of Yi under the lead of Zhuge Liang. They defeated the king of Yi, (&quot;Mot Hop&quot;, ) and expanded their conquered territory in Yi area. After that, the Jin Dynasty succeeded Shu as the suzerain of Yi area but with weak control.

===Yunnan kingdoms===
Some historians believe that the majority of the kingdom of Nanzhao were of the Bai people, but that the elite spoke a variant of Nuosu (also called &quot;Yi&quot;), a Tibeto-Burman language closely related to Burmese. The Cuanman people came to power in Yunnan during Zhuge Liang&#x27;s Southern Campaign in 225. By the fourth century they had gained control of the region, but they rebelled against the Sui dynasty in 593 and were destroyed by a retaliatory expedition in 602. The Cuan split into two groups known as the Black and White Mywa. The White Mywa (Baiman) tribes, who are considered the predecessors of the Bai people, settled on the fertile land of western Yunnan around the alpine fault lake Erhai. The Black Mywa (Wuman), considered to be predecessors of the Yi people, settled in the mountainous regions of eastern Yunnan. These tribes were called Mengshe (蒙舍), Mengxi (蒙嶲), Langqiong (浪穹), Tengtan (邆賧), Shilang (施浪), and Yuexi (越析). Each tribe was known as a &quot;zhao&quot;. In academia, the ethnic composition of the Nanzhao kingdom&#x27;s population has been debated for a century. Chinese scholars tend to favour the theory that the rulers came from the aforementioned Bai or Yi groups, while some non-Chinese scholars subscribed to the theory that the Tai ethnic group was a major component, that later moved south into modern-day Thailand and Laos.

In 649, the chieftain of the Mengshe tribe, Xinuluo (細奴邏), founded the Great Meng (大蒙) and took the title of Qijia Wang (奇嘉王; &quot;Outstanding King&quot;). He acknowledged Tang suzerainty. In 652, Xinuluo absorbed the White Mywa realm of Zhang Lejinqiu, who ruled Erhai Lake and Cang Mountain. This event occurred peacefully as Zhang made way for Xinuluo of his own accord. The agreement was consecrated under an iron pillar in Dali. Thereafter the Black and White Mywa acted as warriors and ministers respectively.

In 704 the Tibetan Empire made the White Mywa tribes into vassals or tributaries.

In the year 737 AD, with the support of the Tang dynasty, the great-grandson of Xinuluo, Piluoge (皮羅閣), united the six &quot;zhao&quot;s in succession, establishing a new kingdom called Nanzhao (Mandarin, &quot;Southern Zhao&quot;). The capital was established in 738 at Taihe, (the site of modern-day Taihe village, a few miles south of Dali). Located in the heart of the Erhai valley, the site was ideal: it could be easily defended against attack and it was in the midst of rich farmland. Under the reign of Piluoge, the White Mywa were removed from eastern Yunnan and resettled in the west. The Black and White Mywa were separated to create a more solidified caste system of ministers and warriors.

Nanzhao existed for 165 years until A.D. 902. After 35 years of tangled warfare, Duan Siping () of the Bai birth founded the Kingdom of Dali, succeeding the territory of Nanzhao. Most Yi of that time were under the ruling of Dali. Dali&#x27;s sovereign reign lasted for 316 years until it was conquered by Kublai Khan. During the era of Dali, Yi people lived in the territory of Dali but had little communication with the royalty of Dali.

Kublai Khan included Dali in his domain. The Yuan emperors remained firmly in control of the Yi people and the area they inhabited as part of Kublai Khan&#x27;s Yunnan Xingsheng () at current Yunnan, Guizhou and part of Sichuan. In order to enhance its sovereign over the area, the Yuan dynasty set up a dominion for Yi, Luoluo Xuanweisi (), the name of which means local appeasement government for Lolos. Although technically under the rule of the Yuan emperor, the Yi still had autonomy during the Yuan dynasty. The gulf between aristocrats and the common people increased during this time.

===Ming and Qing dynasties===

Beginning with the Ming dynasty, the Chinese empire expedited its cultural assimilation policy in Southwestern China, spreading the policy of (, &#x27;replacing &quot;tusi&quot; (local chieftains) with &quot;normal&quot; officials&#x27;). The governing power of many Yi feudal lords had previously been expropriated by the successors of officials assigned by the central government. With the progress of &quot;gaitu guiliu&quot;, the Yi area was dismembered into many communities both large and small, and it was difficult for the communities to communicate with each other as there were often Han-ruled areas between them.

The Kangxi Emperor of the Qing dynasty defeated Wu Sangui and took over the land of Yunnan and established a provincial government there. When Ortai became the Viceroy of Yunnan and Guizhou during the era of Yongzheng Emperor, the policy of and cultural assimilation against Yi were strengthened. Under these policies, Yi who lived near Kunming were forced to abandon their convention of traditional cremation and adopt burial, a policy which triggered rebellions among the Yi. The Qing dynasty suppressed these rebellions.

After the Second Opium War (1856–1860), many Christian missionaries from France and Great Britain visited the area in which the Yi lived. Although some missionaries believed that Yi of some areas such as Liangshan were not under the ruling of Qing dynasty and should be independent, most aristocrats insisted that Yi was a part of China despite their resentment against Qing rule.

===Modern era===
Long Yun, a Yi, was the military governor of Yunnan, during the Republic of China rule on mainland China.

The Fourth Front Army of the CCP encountered the Yi people during the Long March and many Yi joined the communist forces.

After the establishment of the PRC, several Yi autonomous administrative districts of prefecture or county level were set up in Sichuan, Yunnan and Guizhou. With the development of automotive traffic and telecommunications, the communications among different Yi areas have been increasing sharply.

Yi people face systematic discrimination and abuse as migrant laborers in contemporary China.

*Kingdom of Shu (1621–1629), a short-lived state during the She-An Rebellion

==Language==
The Chinese government recognizes six mutually unintelligible Yi languages, from various branches of the Loloish family:
*Northern Yi (Nuosu 诺苏)
*Western Yi (Lalo 腊罗)
*Central Yi (Lolopo 倮倮泼)
*Southern Yi (Nisu 尼苏)
*Southeastern Yi (Sani 撒尼)
*Eastern Yi (Nasu 纳苏)
Northern Yi is the largest with some two million speakers and is the basis of the literary language. It is an analytic language. There are also ethnically Yi languages of Vietnam which use the Yi script, such as Mantsi.

Many Yi in Yunnan, Guizhou and Guangxi know Standard Chinese and code-switching between Yi and Chinese is common.

===Script===
The Yi script was originally logosyllabic like Chinese and dates to at least the 13th century, but seems to be completely independent of any other known script. Until the early 20th century, usage of this script was primarily the domain of &quot;bimo&quot; priests for transmitting ritual texts from generation to generation. It was not until the mid-twentieth century that elite families in Liangshan began to use the script for non-religious purposes, such as letter writing.

There were perhaps 10,000 characters, many of which were regional, since the script had never been standardized across the Yi peoples. A number of works of history, literature and medicine, as well as genealogies of the ruling families, written in the Old Yi script are still in use and there are Old Yi stone tablets and steles in the area.

An attempt to romanize the script was made in the 1950s but it failed to gain traction. In the 1970s and 1980s, the traditional script was standardized into a syllabary. Syllabic Yi is widely used in books, newspapers, street signs, and education, although with increasing influence from Chinese.

==Culture==

===Gender===
Descent and inheritance in Yi society was traditionally patrilineal and men were generally considered superior to women. Men practiced polygamy and levirate marriage. Women were excluded from oral genealogies. In certain locales, Yi women still lag behind men in terms of primary education and very few Yi women become educational instructors or political leaders. Yi women noticeably drank and smoked more than Han Chinese women.

===Names===
The Yi use a son-father patronymic naming system. The last character of the father&#x27;s name transfers to become the first character of the son&#x27;s name. The last character of the son&#x27;s name is then used as the first character of the grandson&#x27;s name. A complete Yi name is composed of the clan name, the branch clan name, the father&#x27;s name, and the person&#x27;s own name (ex. Aho Bbujji Jjiha Lomusse). Aho is the name of a tribe, Bbuji is the name of a clan, Jjiha is the father&#x27;s name, and Lomusse is a personal name. The name therefore means Lomusse the son of Jjiha of the Bbujji clan of the Aho tribe. Within the clan he would just be called Lomusse and within the tribe he would be called Jjiha Lomusse. Yi names use the suffixes -&quot;sse&quot; and -&quot;mo&quot; to express maleness and femaleness respectively. 

This system can also be seen in the names of Nanzhao&#x27;s rulers:

* Xinuluo
* Luosheng
* Shengluopi
* Piluoge
* Geluofeng
* Fengjiayi
* Yimouxun
* Xungequan
* &quot;Quanfengyou&quot; – sought to imitate Chinese practices and only went by Fengyou; broke tradition and named his son Shilong
* Shilong
* Longshun
* Shunhuazhen

This is a tradition closely tied to Tibeto-Burman traditions and suggests that the rulers of Nanzhao were not Tai people.

===Slavery===
Traditional Yi society was divided into four castes, the aristocratic &quot;nuohuo&quot;/&quot;nzymo&quot; Black Yi, the commoner &quot;qunuo&quot;/&quot;quho&quot; White Yi, the &quot;ajia&quot;/&quot;mgajie&quot;, and the &quot;xiaxi&quot;/&quot;gaxy&quot;. The Black Yi made up around 7 per cent of the population while the White Yi made up 50 per cent of the population. The two castes did not intermarry and the Black Yi were always considered of higher status than the White Yi, even if the White Yi was wealthier or owned more slaves. The White and Black Yi also lived in separate villages. The Black Yi did not farm, which was traditionally done by White Yi and slaves. Black Yi were responsible only for administration and military activities. The White Yi were not technically slaves but lived as indentured servants to the Black Yi. The Ajia made up 33 per cent of the population. They were owned by both the Black and White Yi and worked as indentured laborers lower than the White Yi. The Xiaxi were the lowest caste. They were slaves who lived with their owners&#x27; livestock and had no rights. They could be beaten, sold, and killed for sport. Membership of all four castes was through patrilineal descent. The prevalence of the slave culture was so great that sometimes children were named after how many slaves they owned. For example: Lurbbu (many slaves), Lurda (strong slaves), Lurshy (commander of slaves), Lurnji (origin of slaves), Lurpo (slave lord), Lurha, (hundred slaves), Jjinu (lots of slaves).

Cases of the caste slavery system&#x27;s influence could be found as late as the 1980s and early 1990s, when &quot;nuohuo&quot; clans prevented marriage with &quot;qunuo&quot; or punished members who did.

===Folklore===
The most famous hero in Yi mythology is Zhyge Alu. He was the son of a dragon and an eagle who possessed supernatural strength, anti-magic, and anti-ghost powers. He rode a nine-winged flying horse called &quot;long heavenly wings.&quot; He also had the help of a magical peacock and python. The magical peacock was called Shuotnyie Voplie and could deafen the ears of those who heard its cry, but if invited into one&#x27;s house, would consume evil and expel leprosy. The python, called Bbahxa Ayuosse, was defeated by Zhyge Alu, who wrestled with it in the ocean after transforming into a dragon. It was said to be able to detect leprosy, cure tuberculosis, and eradicate epidemics. Like the Chinese mythological archer, Hou Yi, Zhyge Alu shoots down the suns to save the people. In the Yi religion Bimoism, Zhyge Alu aids the bimo priests in curing leprosy and fighting ghosts.

Jiegujienuo was a ghost that caused dizziness, slowness in action, dementia and anxiety. The ghost was blamed for ailments and exorcism rituals were conducted to combat the ghost. The bimo erected small sticks considered to be sacred, the kiemobbur, at the ritual site in preparation.

===Torch Festival===
The Torch Festival is one of the Yi people&#x27;s main holidays. According to Yi legend, there were once two men of great strength, Sireabi and Atilaba. Sireabi lived in heaven while Atilaba on earth. When Sireabi heard of Atilaba&#x27;s strength, he challenged Atilaba to a wrestling match. After suffering two defeats, Sireabi was killed in a bout, which greatly angered the bodhisattavas, who sent a plague of locusts to punish the earth. On the 24th day of the 6th month of the lunar calendar, Atilaba cut down many pine trees and used them as torches to kill the locusts, protecting the crops from destruction. The Torch Festival is thus held in his honor.

===Music===
The Yi play a number of traditional musical instruments, including large plucked and bowed string instruments, as well as wind instruments called &quot;bawu&quot; () and &quot;mabu&quot; (). The Yi also play the hulu sheng, though unlike other minority groups in Yunnan, the Yi do not play the hulu sheng for courtship or love songs (aiqing). The kouxian, a small four-pronged instrument similar to the Jew&#x27;s harp, is another commonly found instrument among the Liangshan Yi. Kouxian songs are most often improvised and are supposed to reflect the mood of the player or the surrounding environment. Kouxian songs can also occasionally function in the aiqing form. Yi dance is perhaps the most commonly recognized form of musical performance, as it is often performed during publicly sponsored holidays and/or festival events.

===Literature===
Artist Colette Fu, great-granddaughter of Long Yun has spent time from 1996 till present photographing the Yi community in Yunnan Province. Her series of pop-up books, titled &quot;We are Tiger Dragon People&quot;, includes images of many Yi groups.

==Religion==
===Bimoism===
===Other religions===

In Yunnan, some of the Yi have adopted Buddhism as a result of exchanges with other predominantly Buddhist ethnic groups present in Yunnan, such as the Dai and the Tibetans. The most important god of Yi Buddhism is Mahākāla, a wrathful deity found in Vajrayana and Tibetan Buddhism. In the 20th century, many Yi people in China converted to Christianity, after the arrival of Gladstone Porteous in 1904 and, later, medical missionaries such as Alfred James Broomhall, Janet Broomhall, Ruth Dix and Joan Wales of the China Inland Mission. According to missionary organization OMF International, the exact number of Yi Christians is not known. In 1991 it was reported that there were as many as 1,500,000 Yi Christians in Yunnan Province, especially in Luquan County where there are more than 20 churches.

==Medicine==
The Yi are known for the extent of their inter-generational transmission of traditional medicine through oral tradition and written records. Their traditional medicine system has been academically inventoried. Since the prefecture the Yi medicinal data was collected from also contains the cave containing human-infectable SARS clades and it is known that people living in the vicinity SARS caves show serological signs of past infection, it has been suggested that the Yi were repeatably exposed to coronavirus over their history, passively learned to medicinally fend off coronavirus infection centuries ago, and committed the results into their inter-generational record of medicinal indications.

<text>English is the most widely spoken and &quot;de facto&quot; official language of the United Kingdom. A number of regional and migrant languages are also spoken. Indigenous regional languages include the Celtic languages Irish, Scottish Gaelic and Welsh and the West Germanic Scots and Ulster Scots. There are many non-native languages spoken by immigrants, including Polish, Hindi, and Urdu. British Sign Language is sometimes used as well as liturgical and hobby languages such as Latin and a revived form of Cornish.

Welsh is spoken by 538,300 people in Wales according to the 2021 census, though data from the Annual Population Survey shows that 28%, or roughly 862,700 people, of Wales&#x27; population aged three and over were able to speak the language in March 2024. Additionally, 32.5% (1,001,500) reported that they could understand spoken Welsh, 24.7% (759,200) could read and 22.2% (684,500) could write in Welsh. Welsh is a &quot;de jure&quot; official language under the Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011 in Wales. 

Irish is spoken by about 124,000 people in Northern Ireland, and is now a &quot;de jure&quot; official language there alongside English.

==Regional languages and statistics==


=== English ===
In the 2011 UK census, 98% of people over the age of three were reported as speaking English.

English is a West Germanic language brought around the 5th century CE to the east coast of what is now England by Germanic-speaking immigrants from around present-day northern Germany, who came to be known as the Anglo-Saxons. The fusion of these settlers&#x27; dialects became what is now termed Old English: the word &quot;English&quot; is derived from the name of the Angles. English soon displaced the previously predominant Common Brittonic and British Latin throughout most of England. It spread into what was to become south-east Scotland under the influence of the Anglian medieval kingdom of Northumbria. Following the economic, political, military, scientific, cultural, and colonial influence of Great Britain and the United Kingdom from the 18th century, via the British Empire, and of the United States since the mid-20th century, it has been widely dispersed around the world, and become the leading language of international discourse. Many English words are based on roots from Latin, because Latin in some form was the lingua franca of the Christian Church and of European intellectual life. The language was further influenced by the Old Norse language, with Viking invasions and settlements in England from the 8th to the 11th centuries. The Norman conquest of England in 1066 gave rise to heavy borrowings from Old French, and vocabulary and spelling conventions began to give what had now become Middle English the superficial appearance of a close relationship with Romance languages. The Great Vowel Shift that began in the south of England in the 15th century is one of the historical events marking the separation of Middle and Modern English.

===Wales===

Welsh () emerged in the 6th century from Brittonic, the common ancestor of Welsh, Breton, Cornish, and the extinct language known as Cumbric. Welsh is thus a member of the Brythonic branch of the Celtic languages, and is spoken natively in Wales. There are also Welsh speakers in (The Colony), a Welsh settlement in Argentina, which began in 1865 and is situated mainly along the coast of Chubut Province in the south of Patagonia. It is believed that there are as many as 5,000 speakers of Patagonian Welsh.

Both the English and Welsh languages have official, but not always equal, status in Wales. English has &quot;de facto&quot; official status everywhere, whereas Welsh has limited, but still considerable, official, &quot;de jure&quot;, status in only the public service, the judiciary, and elsewhere as prescribed in legislation. The Welsh language is protected by the Welsh Language Act 1993 and the Government of Wales Act 1998, and since 1998 it has been common, for example, for almost all British Government Departments to provide both printed documentation and official websites in both English and Welsh. On 7 December 2010, the National Assembly for Wales unanimously approved a set of measures to develop the use of the Welsh language within Wales. On 9 February 2011, this measure received Royal Assent and was passed, thus making the Welsh language an officially recognised language within Wales.

The Welsh Language Board indicated in 2004 that 553,000 people (19.7% of the population of Wales in households or communal establishments) were able to speak Welsh. Based on an alternative definition, there has been a 0.9 percentage point increase when compared with the 2001 census, and an increase of approximately 35,000 in absolute numbers within Wales. Welsh is therefore a growing language within Wales. Of those 553,000 Welsh speakers, 57% (315,000) were considered by others to be fluent, and 477,000 people consider themselves fluent or &quot;fair&quot; speakers. 62% of speakers (340,000) claimed to speak the language daily, including 88% of fluent speakers.

However, there is some controversy over the actual number who speak Welsh: some statistics include people who have studied Welsh to GCSE standard, many of whom could not be regarded as fluent speakers of the language. Conversely, some first-language speakers may choose not to report themselves as such. These phenomena, also seen with other minority languages outside the UK, make it harder to establish an accurate and unbiased figure for how many people speak it fluently. Furthermore, no question about Welsh language ability was asked in the 2001 census outside Wales, thereby ignoring a considerable population of Welsh speakers – particularly concentrated in neighbouring English counties and in London and other large cities. It is estimated that 110,000 to 150,000 people in England speak Welsh.

Nevertheless, the 2011 census recorded an overall reduction in Welsh speakers, from 582,000 in 2001 to 562,000 in 2011, despite an increase in the size of the population—a 2% drop (from 21% to 19%) in the proportion of Welsh speakers.

The 2021 United Kingdom census indicated that on census day, the population of England and Wales as 59.6 million. Of this population, roughly 538,300 people noted that they could speak Welsh, or 0.90% of the population. Within Wales, this percentage grows to 17.8%. In addition, data from the Annual Population Survey shows that 28%, or roughly 862,700 people, of Wales&#x27; population aged three and over were able to speak the language in March 2024.

===Scotland===

====Scottish Gaelic (Gàidhlig)====
Scottish Gaelic is a Celtic language native to Scotland. A member of the Goidelic branch of the Celtic languages, Scottish Gaelic, like Modern Irish and Manx, developed out of Middle Irish, and thus descends ultimately from Primitive Irish. Outside Scotland, a dialect of the language known as Canadian Gaelic exists in Canada on Cape Breton Island and isolated areas of the Nova Scotia mainland. This variety has around 2000 speakers, amounting to 1.3% of the population of Cape Breton Island.

The 2011 census of Scotland showed that a total of 57,375 people (1.1% of the Scottish population aged over three years old) in Scotland could speak Gaelic at that time, with the Outer Hebrides being the main stronghold of the language. The census results indicate a decline of 1,275 Gaelic speakers from 2001. A total of 87,056 people in 2011 reported having some facility with Gaelic compared to 93,282 people in 2001, a decline of 6,226. Despite this decline, revival efforts exist and the number of speakers of the language under age 20 has increased.

The Gaelic language was given official recognition for the first time in Scotland in 2005, by the Scottish Parliament&#x27;s &quot;Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005&quot;, which aims to promote the Gaelic language to a status &quot;commanding equal respect&quot; with English. However, this wording has no clear meaning in law, and was chosen to prevent the assumption that the Gaelic language is in any way considered to have &quot;equal validity or parity of esteem with English&quot;. A major limitation of the act, though, is that it does not constitute any form of recognition for the Gaelic language by the UK government, and UK public bodies operating in Scotland, as reserved bodies, are explicitly exempted from its provisions.

====Scots====

The Scots language originated from Northumbrian Old English. The Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Northumbria stretched from south Yorkshire to the Firth of Forth from where the Scottish elite continued the language shift northwards. Since there are no universally accepted criteria for distinguishing languages from dialects, scholars and other interested parties often disagree about the linguistic, historical and social status of Scots. Although a number of paradigms for distinguishing between languages and dialects do exist, these often render contradictory results. Focused broad Scots is at one end of a bipolar linguistic continuum, with Scottish Standard English at the other. Consequently, Scots is often regarded as one of the ancient varieties of English, but with its own distinct dialects. Alternatively Scots is sometimes treated as a distinct Germanic language, in the way Norwegian is closely linked to, yet distinct from, Danish.

The 2011 UK census was the first to ask residents of Scotland about Scots. A campaign called Aye Can was set up to help individuals answer the question. The specific wording used was &quot;Which of these can you do? Tick all that apply&quot; with options for &#x27;Understand&#x27;, &#x27;Speak&#x27;, &#x27;Read&#x27; and &#x27;Write&#x27; in three columns: English, Scottish Gaelic and Scots. Of approximately 5.1 million respondents, about 1.2 million (24%) could speak, read and write Scots, 3.2 million (62%) had no skills in Scots and the remainder had some degree of skill, such as understanding Scots (0.27 million, 5.2%) or being able to speak it but not read or write it (0.18 million, 3.5%). There were also small numbers of Scots speakers recorded in England and Wales on the 2011 Census, with the largest numbers being either in bordering areas (e.g. Carlisle) or in areas that had recruited large numbers of Scottish workers in the past (e.g. Corby or the former mining areas of Kent).

The 2022 census for Scotland reported that of a population of 5,436,600 in Scotland, 1,508,540 people could speak Scots, or 27.74% of the population of Scotland. However, with an estimated population of 67.6 million in the UK in 2022, this percentage falls to 2.23% of the population of the UK.

===Northern Ireland===

====Ulster Scots====

2% speak Ulster Scots, seen by some as a language distinct from English and by some as a dialect of English, according to the 1999 Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey (around 30,000 speakers). Some definitions of Ulster Scots may also include Standard English spoken with an Ulster Scots accent. The language was brought to Ireland by Scottish planters from the 16th Century.

====Irish (Gaeilge)====

Irish was the predominant language of the Irish people for most of their recorded history, and they brought their Gaelic speech with them to other countries, notably Scotland and the Isle of Man where it gave rise to Scottish Gaelic and Manx.

It has been estimated that the active Irish-language scene probably comprises 5 to 10 per cent of Ireland&#x27;s population. In the 2011 census, 11% of the population of Northern Ireland claimed &quot;some knowledge of Irish&quot; and 3.7% reported being able to &quot;speak, read, write and understand&quot; Irish. In another survey, from 1999, 1% of respondents said they spoke it as their main language at home.
===Cornwall===

Cornish, a Brythonic Celtic language related to Welsh, was spoken in Cornwall throughout the Middle Ages. Its use began to decline from the 14th century, especially after the Prayer Book Rebellion in 1549. The language continued to function as a first language in Penwith in the far west of Cornwall until the late 18th century, with the last native speaker thought to have died in 1777.

A revival initiated by Henry Jenner began in 1903. In 2002, the Cornish language was named as a historical regional language under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. The UN classes it as a critically endangered language.

===Principal minority language areas===
*Welsh: North-West Wales: Percentage of speakers 69% (76% understand Welsh). Population: Gwynedd - 118,400 (2001 census)
*Scottish Gaelic: Outer Hebrides: Percentage of speakers 61%. Population: Na h-Eileanan Siar - 27,400 In the 2001 census, each island overall was over 50% Gaelic speaking – South Uist (71%), Harris (69%), Barra (68%), North Uist (67%), Lewis (56%) and Benbecula (56%). With 59.3% of Gaelic speakers or a total of 15,723 speakers, this made the Outer Hebrides the most strongly coherent Gaelic speaking area in Scotland.

===British Sign Language===

British Sign Language, often abbreviated to BSL, is the language of 125,000 Deaf adults, about 0.3% of the total population of the United Kingdom. It is not exclusively the language of Deaf people; many relatives of Deaf people and others can communicate in it fluently. Recognised to be a language by the UK Government on 18 March 2003, BSL has the highest number of monolingual users of any indigenous minority language in the UK.

==Status==
Certain nations and regions of the UK have frameworks for the promotion of their autochthonous languages.

* In Wales, the Welsh Language Act 1993 requires English and Welsh to be treated equally throughout the public sector. This was further enforced through the passing of the Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011. 
* In Scotland, the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005 gave the Scottish Gaelic language its first statutory basis; and the Western Isles region of Scotland has a policy to promote the language.
* In Northern Ireland, the Identity and Language (Northern Ireland) Act 2022 will “provide official recognition of the status of the Irish language” (in addition to English), with Ulster Scots as an officially recognised minority language.

The UK government has ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in respect of:
*Cornish (in Cornwall)
*Irish and Ulster Scots (in Northern Ireland)
*Manx (in the Isle of Man)
*Scots and Scottish Gaelic (in Scotland)
*Welsh (in Wales)

Under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages (which is not legally enforceable, but which requires states to adopt appropriate legal provision for the use of regional and minority languages) the UK government has committed itself to the recognition of certain regional languages and the promotion of certain linguistic traditions. The UK has ratified for the higher level of protection (Section III) provided for by the Charter in respect of Welsh, Scottish Gaelic and Irish. Cornish, Scots in Scotland and Northern Ireland (in the latter territory officially known as Ulster Scots or Ullans, but in the speech of users simply as Scottish or Scots) are protected by the lower level only (Section II). The UK government has also recognised British Sign Language as a language in its own right of the United Kingdom.

A number of bodies have been established to oversee the promotion of the regional languages: in Scotland, Bòrd na Gàidhlig oversees Scottish Gaelic. Foras na Gaeilge has an all-Ireland remit as a cross-border language body, and Tha Boord o Ulstèr-Scotch is intended to fulfil a similar function for Ulster Scots, although hitherto it has mainly concerned itself with culture. In Wales, the Welsh Language Commissioner (Comisiynydd y Gymraeg) is an independent body established to promote and facilitate use of the Welsh language, mainly by imposing Welsh language standards on organisations. The Cornish Language Partnership is a body that represents the major Cornish language and cultural groups and local government&#x27;s language needs. It receives funding from the UK government and the European Union, and is the regulator of the language&#x27;s Standard Written Form, agreed in 2008.

=== Controversies ===
====Language versus dialect====
There are no universally accepted criteria for distinguishing &quot;languages&quot; from &quot;dialects&quot;, although a number of paradigms exist, which give sometimes contradictory results. The distinction is therefore a subjective one, dependent on the user&#x27;s frame of reference.

Scottish Gaelic and Irish are generally viewed as being languages in their own right rather than dialects of a single tongue, but they are sometimes mutually intelligible to a limited degree – especially between southern dialects of Scottish and northern dialects of Irish (programmes in these two forms of Gaelic are broadcast respectively on BBC Radio nan Gàidheal and RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta), but the relationship between Scots and English is less clear, since there is usually partial mutual intelligibility.

Since there is a very high level of mutual intelligibility between contemporary speakers of Scots in Scotland and in Ulster (Ulster Scots), and a common written form was current well into the 20th century, the two varieties have usually been considered as dialects of a single tongue rather than languages in their own right; the written forms have diverged in the 21st century. The government of the United Kingdom &quot;recognises that Scots and Ulster Scots meet the Charter&#x27;s definition of a regional or minority language&quot;. Whether this implies recognition of one regional or minority language or two is a question of interpretation. Ulster Scots is defined in legislation (The North/South Co-operation (Implementation Bodies) Northern Ireland Order 1999) as: &quot;the variety of the Scots language which has traditionally been used in parts of Northern Ireland and in Donegal in Ireland&quot;.

While in continental Europe closely related languages and dialects may get official recognition and support, in the UK there is a tendency to view closely related vernaculars as a single language. Even British Sign Language is mistakenly thought of as a form of &#x27;English&#x27; by some, rather than as a language in its own right, with a distinct grammar and vocabulary. The boundaries are not always clear cut, which makes it hard to estimate numbers of speakers.

====Hostility====
In Northern Ireland, the use of Irish and Ulster Scots is sometimes viewed as politically loaded, despite both having been used by all communities in the past. According to the Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey 1999, the ratio of Unionist to Nationalist users of Ulster Scots is 2:1. About 1% of Catholics claim to speak it, while 2% of Protestants claim to speak it. The disparity in the ratios as determined by political and faith community, despite the very large overlap between the two, reflects the very low numbers of respondents. Across the two communities 0% speak it as their main language at home. A 2:1 ratio would not differ markedly from that among the general population in those areas of Northern Ireland where Scots is spoken.

Often the use of the Irish language in Northern Ireland has met with the considerable suspicion of Unionists, who have associated it with the largely Catholic Republic of Ireland, and more recently, with the republican movement in Northern Ireland itself. Catholic areas of Belfast have street signs in Irish similar to those in the Republic. Approximately 14% of the population speak Irish, however only 1% speak it as their main language at home. Under the St Andrews Agreement, the British government committed itself to introducing an Irish Language Act, and it was hoped that a consultation period ending on 2 March 2007 could see Irish becoming an official language, having equal validity with English, recognised as an indigenous language, or aspire to become an official language in the future. However, with the restoration of the Northern Ireland Assembly in May 2007, responsibility for this was passed to the Assembly, and the commitment was promptly broken. In October 2007, the then Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure, Edwin Poots MLA, announced to the assembly that no Irish Language Act would be brought forward. As of April 2016, no Irish Language Act applying to Northern Ireland has been passed, and none is currently planned.

Some resent Scottish Gaelic being promoted in the Lowlands. Gaelic place names are relatively rare in the extreme south-east (that part of Scotland which had previously been under Northumbrian rule) and the extreme north-east (part of Caithness, where Norse was previously spoken).

Two areas with mostly Norse-derived placenames (and some Pictish), the Northern Isles (Shetland and Orkney) were ceded to Scotland in lieu of an unpaid dowry in 1472, and never spoke Gaelic; its traditional vernacular Norn, a derivative of Old Norse mutually intelligible with Icelandic and Faroese, died out in the 18th century after large-scale immigration by Lowland Scots speakers. To this day, many Shetlanders and Orcadians maintain a separate identity, albeit through the Shetland and Orcadian dialects of Lowland Scots, rather than their former tongue. Norn was also spoken at one point in Caithness, apparently dying out much earlier than Shetland and Orkney. However, the Norse speaking population were entirely assimilated by the Gaelic speaking population in the Western Isles; to what degree this happened in Caithness is a matter of controversy, although Gaelic was spoken in parts of the county until the 20th century.

====Non-recognition====
Scots within Scotland and the regional varieties of English within England receive little or no official recognition. The dialects of northern England share some features with Scots that those of southern England do not. The regional dialects of England were once extremely varied, as is recorded in Joseph Wright&#x27;s &quot;English Dialect Dictionary&quot; and the Survey of English Dialects, but they have died out over time so that regional differences are now largely in pronunciation rather than in grammar or vocabulary.

Public funding of minority languages continues to produce mixed reactions, and there is sometimes resistance to their teaching in schools. Partly as a result, proficiency in languages other than &quot;Standard&quot; English can vary widely.

==Immigrant languages==

Communities migrating to the UK in recent decades have brought many more languages to the country. Surveys started in 1979 by the Inner London Education Authority discovered over 100 languages being spoken domestically by the families of the inner city&#x27;s school children. Current school censuses collect information on over 300 language categories. Data on the total number of languages entered onto national census forms in 2021 (England and Wales and Northern Ireland), and 2022 (Scotland) is not yet published but write in data in 2011 covered over 600 languages and categories.

Many Black Britons speak English as their first language. Their ancestors mostly came from the West Indies, particularly Jamaica, and generally also spoke English-based creole languages, hence there are significant numbers of Caribbean creole speakers (see below for Ethnologue figures). A large proportion of the Black British population, especially African-born immigrants speak French as a first or second language.

British Asians speak dozens of different languages, and it is difficult to determine how many people speak each language alongside English. The largest subgroup of British Asians are those of Punjabi origin (representing approximately two thirds of direct migrants from South Asia to the UK), from both India and Pakistan, they number over 2 million in the UK and are the largest Punjabi community outside of Indo subcontinent.

Among British Pakistanis, Pahari-Pothwari (and particularly &quot;Mirpuri&quot;) is the most spoken language. Since it is a spoken language lacking a standardised form, Urdu is also used by the community in the media and literature. The Punjabi language movement considers it to be a dialect of Punjabi. There have been efforts by numerous initiatives to document and gain recognition for the language, particularly in wake of the 2021 United Kingdom census. Institutions such as the National Health Service (NHS) have started to provide Pothwari translation services throughout the country.

Predominantly people of Bangladeshi origin in the UK speak Sylheti, which is mostly a spoken language with no standard form, and is also generally considered as a dialect of Bengali. Recent Italian-Bangladeshi migrants to the UK mostly speak standard Bengali (including other dialects). Standard Bengali is used by the community as a whole particularly in media. Sylheti had been enlisted as part of the list of native languages spoken by students in British schools, and some institutions such as the National Health Service (NHS) provide Sylheti translation services.

===Most common immigrant languages===
According to the 2021 census, English or Welsh was the main language of 91.1% of the residents of England and Wales. Among other languages, the most common were as follows.
# Polish 611,845 or 1.1% of the population
# Romanian 471,954 or 0.8%
# Punjabi 290,745 or 0.5%
# Urdu 269,849 or 0.5%
# Portuguese 224,719 or 0.4%
# Spanish 215,062 or 0.4%
# Arabic (with Varieties of Arabic) 203,998 or 0.4%
# Bengali (with Sylheti and Chatgaya) 199,495 or 0.3%
# Gujarati 188,956 or 0.3%
# Italian 160,010 or 0.3%
# Tamil 125,363 or 0.2%
# French 120,259 or 0.2%
# Lithuanian 119,656 or 0.2%
# Chinese 118,271 or 0.2%
# Turkish 112,978 or 0.2%
# Bulgarian 111,431 or 0.2%
# Russian 91,255 or 0.2%
# Persian 87,713 or 0.2%
# Hungarian 87,356 or 0.2%
# Greek 76,675 or 0.1%

==Second or additional languages==

Throughout the UK, many citizens can speak a second or even a third language from secondary school education, primary school education or from private classes. A 2006 survey found that 23% of the UK population self-reported that they could hold a &quot;basic conversation&quot; in French, 9% in German and 8% in Spanish. In the same survey, 38% of UK citizens reported that they could speak (well enough to have a conversation) at least one language other than their mother tongue, 18% at least two languages and 6% at least three languages. 62% of UK citizens cannot speak any second language. These figures include those who describe their level of ability in the second language as &quot;basic&quot;. 

Language teaching is compulsory in all English schools from the ages of 5 or 7. Modern and ancient languages, such as French, German, Spanish, Latin, Greek, Urdu, Mandarin, Russian, Bengali, Hebrew, and Arabic, are studied. Language teaching is compulsory from the ages of 11 or 12 in Scotland and Wales.

==Law French and Latin==
Law French is still used in the Houses of Parliament for certain official business between the clerks of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, and on other official occasions such as the dissolution of Parliament.

Latin is also used to a limited degree in certain official mottoes, for example &quot;Nemo me impune lacessit&quot;, legal terminology (&quot;habeas corpus&quot;), and various ceremonial contexts. Latin abbreviations can also be seen on British coins. The use of Latin has declined greatly in recent years. However, the Catholic Church retains Latin in official and quasi-official contexts. Latin remains the language of the Roman Rite, and the Tridentine Mass is celebrated in Latin. Although the Mass of Paul VI is usually celebrated in English, it can be and often is said in Latin, in part or whole, especially at multilingual gatherings. It is the official language of the Holy See, the primary language of its public journal, the &quot;Acta Apostolicae Sedis&quot;, and the working language of the Roman Rota.

At one time, Latin and Greek were commonly taught in British schools (and were required for entrance to the ancient universities until 1919, for Greek, and the 1960s, for Latin), and A-Levels and Highers are still available in both subjects.

==Extinct languages==

===Cornish===
Cornish became extinct as a first language in the late 18th century, ceasing to have any fully competent speakers by 1800. Its cultural legacy has continued within Cornwall.

There are small numbers of second-language speakers of revived varieties of Cornish, and these appear in the table of living languages in this article. Many people therefore regard the Cornish language not as &quot;extinct&quot; but as &quot;critically endangered&quot; or by other similar terms.

===Norn===
A North Germanic once spoken in the Shetland Islands, Orkney Islands and Caithness. It is likely that the language was dying out in the late 18th century, with the reports putting the last Norn speakers in the 19th century. Walter Sutherland from Skaw in Unst, who died about 1850, has been cited as the last native speaker of the Norn language. The remote islands of Foula and Unst are variously claimed as the last refuges of the language in Shetland, where there were people &quot;who could repeat sentences in Norn, probably passages from folk songs or poems, as late as 1893&quot;. Fragments of vocabulary survived the death of the main language and remain to this day, mainly in place-names and terms referring to plants, animals, weather, mood, and fishing vocabulary.

===Kentish Sign===
Unrelated to both Banzsl British Sign Language, Northern Irish SL and Francosign Irish SL, the sign language spoken in Kent was a unique village sign language that fell into disuse and was superseded by BSL in the 17th century. There are weak rumours that Martha&#x27;s Vineyard Sign Language, (one of ASL&#x27;s substrate languages) descended through Kentish signers, though proper evidence has not yet been substantiated.

===Pictish===
Pictish was probably a Brittonic language, or dialect, spoken by the Picts, the people of northern and central Scotland in the Early Middle Ages, which became extinct c.900 AD. There is virtually no direct attestation of Pictish, short of a limited number of geographical and personal names found on monuments and the contemporary records in the area controlled by the Kingdom of the Picts. Such evidence, however, points to the language being closely related to the Brittonic language spoken prior to Anglo-Saxon settlement in what is now southern Scotland, England and Wales. A minority view held by a few scholars claims that Pictish was at least partially non-Indo-European or that a non-Indo-European and Brittonic language coexisted.

===Cumbric===
Cumbric was a variety of the Common Brittonic language spoken during the Early Middle Ages in the &quot;Hen Ogledd&quot; or &quot;Old North&quot; in what is now Northern England and southern Lowland Scotland. It was closely related to Old Welsh and the other Brittonic languages. Place name evidence suggests Cumbric speakers may have carried it into other parts of northern England as migrants from its core area further north. It may also have been spoken as far south as Pendle and the Yorkshire Dales. Most linguists think that it became extinct in the 12th century, after the incorporation of the semi-independent Kingdom of Strathclyde into the Kingdom of Scotland.

<text>Austin William &quot;Goose&quot; Gonsoulin (June 7, 1938 – September 8, 2014) was an American professional football player who was a safety in the American Football League (AFL) for the Denver Broncos and in the National Football League (NFL) for the San Francisco 49ers. The football player was raised in Port Arthur, Texas. He was an All-District and All-state athlete at Thomas Jefferson High School on both the football and track teams. 

Gonsoulin played college football for the Baylor Bears where he was a receiver and a defensive back. He captained the 1959 team. 

Gonsoulin was drafted by the Dallas Texans, but shortly before the inaugural season he was traded to Denver.

At the end of his stint with the Broncos, he was the AFL&#x27;s all-time leader in interceptions with 40. He made the first interception ever in the AFL, in the first league game against the Boston Patriots. He had seven interceptions in his first three games, and his 11 pickoffs in 1960 are still a Denver club record. He shares the team record for interceptions in a game with four, a feat he accomplished September 18, 1960 at Buffalo.

Gonsoulin was a &quot;Sporting News&quot; AFL All-League player in 1960, 1962, and 1963, and an AFL Western Division All-Star in 1961, 1964 and 1966. In 1966, he recorded no interceptions but still was named an AFL All-Star that year. His amazing durability and toughness enabled him to start 61 consecutive games at one point in his career. He was also the captain of his college team at Baylor. Gonsoulin was selected to the second unit of the American Football League All-Time Team. He was tied for 6th all-time in interceptions (46) when he played his last game in 1967.

He was inducted into the Colorado Sports Hall of Fame in 1984. 

Gonsoulin died on September 8, 2014.

<text>Six Flags AstroWorld, also known simply as AstroWorld, was a seasonally operated amusement park in Houston, Texas. Owned and operated by Six Flags, the park was situated between Kirby Drive and Fannin Street, directly south of I-610. The park opened on June 1, 1968, and was developed originally and constructed as part of the Astrodomain, the brainchild of local philanthropist and former Houston mayor Roy Hofheinz, who intended it to complement the Astrodome. The Hofheinz family sold AstroWorld to Six Flags in 1978.

Notable rides featured at the park included the Texas Cyclone, a wooden roller coaster built in 1976 that was modeled after the well-known Coney Island Cyclone, and Thunder River, considered the world&#x27;s first successful river rapids ride when it opened in 1980. WaterWorld, an adjacent water park, was acquired and added to AstroWorld in 2002. Following declining revenue, rising property value, and other issues facing Six Flags, the company closed AstroWorld permanently after its final day of operations on October 30, 2005, the final night of Fright Fest. Many rides were sold at auction or relocated to other Six Flags&#x27; properties, and demolition of the remaining structures was completed by mid-2006.

==History==

===Planning and construction===
Judge Roy Hofheinz, who was one of the original owners of the Houston Astros baseball team and spearheaded the lobbying effort that resulted in Harris County financing the construction of the Astrodome, founded the &quot;Astrodomain&quot; holding company after the Astrodome&#x27;s opening in 1965. It owned in south Houston surrounding the Astrodome. Hofheinz continued to develop the Astrodomain, creating AstroWorld (1968), the Astrohall convention center (which hosted twice-daily stagings of the now-defunct Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus in 1969; Hofheinz had acquired the circus in December 1967), and four hotels with a capacity of 5,600 guests to serve visitors: the Astroworld Motor Hotel (with a private suite for Hofheinz on the ninth floor), Holiday Inn-Astroworld, Howard Johnson Motor Lodge-Astroworld, and Sheraton Inn-Astroworld.

In 1967, Hofheinz initially denied that preliminary work for an amusement park had been underway, but later announced on September 16 that approximately half of the remaining land, , was being developed for a park to be named &quot;Astroworld&quot;. Hofheinz showed an architectural model of the park and announced that Randall Duell and Associates had designed it; Duell, a Hollywood set designer and architect, had previously designed Six Flags Over Texas. An initial $25 million investment paid for extensive landscaping and a long pedestrian viaduct spanning the I-610 freeway, the first privately owned, publicly accessible span over a federal highway. Lloyd, Morgan &amp; Jones designed the bridge.

Additional design work for the park was performed by I. A. Naman &amp; Associates (air conditioning); Lockwood, Andrews &amp; Newnam (electrical); Walter P Moore (structural); Turner, Collie &amp; Braden (civil engineering); and Linesch &amp; Reynolds (landscape architects). of fill was required for the site, because of its low elevation and drainage issues. Dozier Specialty, who had previously worked on Colt Stadium, was the general contractor. The name AstroWorld was selected following Houston&#x27;s designation as the home of the Johnson Space Center in 1965, paying homage to the nation&#x27;s crewed space programs.

Executives commissioned Ed Henderson, a Disney animator, to build a scale replica of the park and design maps for park guests. Henderson&#x27;s model of AstroWorld, measuring , was built as a publicity preview of the park in 1967. Architecture students at Rice University and the University of Houston sculpted many of the buildings. It was displayed in the window of Foley&#x27;s, a downtown department store, then moved to Hofheinz&#x27;s Astrodome suite once the park opened; as an Easter egg, a model of Hofheinz&#x27;s black Cadillac is parked in a private lot in the northwest corner of the park&#x27;s model. After the park closed in 2005, the model was discovered sawed into six pieces in a warehouse, then returned to Henderson. He stored it in his garage before it was displayed in fall 2010 at the Optical Project gallery, operated by artists Bill Davenport and Francesca Fuchs. In 2011, it was sold to I. A. Naman and Associates, the same firm that had designed the park&#x27;s outdoor air conditioning; they donated the model to the Houston Public Library.

===Hofheinz family===

The Hofheinz family, Roy and his three children (Roy Jr., Fred, and Dene), shared ownership of the park. Hofheinz hosted a press preview in May 1968; Leonard Traube wrote the park &quot;has a beautifully realized continuity and layout calculated to move traffic in such a way as to make practical the policy of a single gate admission for virtually everything on the grounds&quot;, referring to the Duell loop that routes visitors through each part of the park.

AstroWorld opened on June 1, 1968, just south of the Astrodome, creating a multi-facility entertainment complex; 50,000 guests visited the park during the first weekend. Hofheinz enlisted two of his grandchildren to launch the amusement park with the release of 2,000 balloons. An initial workforce of 1,200 collected tickets at a price of $4.50 for adults and $3.50 for children. Stan McIlvaine, who had formerly operated Six Flags Over Texas, was the first general manager of AstroWorld. Two of the park&#x27;s sixteen attractions were not operational on opening day.

Marvel McFey, the park&#x27;s official mascot (branded the &quot;Ambassador of Happiness&quot;), was introduced in 1972. He was accompanied by a menagerie of &quot;animal gypsies&quot;: Winston Wolf (the sheriff of AstroWorld); Pigs One, Two, and Three (mischievous tricksters named Quiz, Chiquito, and Harpo); Percy Penguin; Pierre Le Rat (the resident artist); Flopper Rabbit (a country bumpkin); Beethoven Bear (a checkers champion); Samantha Skunk (&quot;a bright purple and pink flower child&quot;); Frieda Frog (McFey&#x27;s secretary); and Lester Lion (a frustrated baseball player). In addition to their in-park greeting and show duties, Marvel and his caravan of Enchanted Animals represented AstroWorld at many civic functions. Rolly Crump designed and built the character costumes.

In 1970, just two years after the opening of Astroworld, Hofheinz survived a stroke that left him in a wheelchair. The enterprise announced a $38 million long-range financing program in 1972, with notes held by General Electric Credit Corp., Ford Motor Credit Co., and HNC Realty. Those creditors assumed control of the Astrodomain in 1974. Astrodomain sold the hotels to Servico Inc. in May 1976. Hofheinz liquidated his interest in the company a short time later.

===Six Flags===
Six Flags purchased a 20-year operating lease for AstroWorld in mid-1975. The following year, Six Flags AstroWorld introduced a new, high-speed roller coaster, the Texas Cyclone. A new playground named &quot;The Magical World of Marvel McFey&quot; was added to Children&#x27;s World for the 1977 season. That same year, Robert Cartmell named the Texas Cyclone the best roller coaster in the world. The formal purchase of AstroWorld by Six Flags concluded in 1978. In 1978, the new attraction was Greezed Lightnin&#x27;, a high-acceleration loop roller coaster.

McFey&#x27;s tenure as the park&#x27;s mascot ended in 1984 as Bugs Bunny and other &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters moved into the Enchanted Kingdom for the 1985 season; AstroWorld&#x27;s parent corporation, Six Flags, had acquired the license to use the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters in 1984 for its theme parks from Marriott along with the Great America in Gurnee theme park; Marriott had held the license since 1976 for its twin Great America parks.

Six Flags continued to change ownership, being purchased by Bally Manufacturing in 1982, then by a private equity firm, Wesray Corporation, in 1987. Time Warner acquired a minority stake in 1990 and owned the company outright by September 1993. During Astroworld&#x27;s first twenty years, it entertained more than thirty million visitors. The amusement park persisted while new competitors in Houston emerged and failed, including Busch Gardens, Hanna–Barbera Land, and SeaArama Marineworld. Attendance increased during these earlier years. In the early 1990s, the Six Flags parks gained access to DC Comics characters through its corporate owner, Time Warner; was installed at AstroWorld for the 1993 season. In February 1998, Premier Parks, led by CEO Kieran Burke, acquired Six Flags Entertainment Corporation. In 1984, Premier, originally Tierco, a property management group, hired Gary Story to rehabilitate one of its properties, an older park named Frontier City in Oklahoma City; Story&#x27;s successful turnaround of that park started the company&#x27;s theme park acquisition program.

===Closure and demolition===
The Six Flags acquisition was part of an ambitious Premier Parks purchasing program, which bought 31 amusement parks in four years, including the 12 Six Flags parks. Burke received a $2 million bonus for completing the Six Flags acquisition. However, Six Flags failed to turn a profit for five straight years after the 1998 acquisition, announcing a $122 million loss for the first half of 2003; capital expenditures began to be scaled back because of its debt load. In August 2005, Six Flags announced it was selling its chain of parks. One month later, on September 12, Burke announced AstroWorld would be closed and demolished at the end of the 2005 season. The company cited issues such as dwindling attendance, rising property value, and conflicts involving off-site parking at Reliant Stadium, which houses the Houston Texans football team and the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo (HLSR). In 1997, the combined attendance of AstroWorld and Water World was 2.27 million visitors; AstroWorld alone was ranked as the 28th most attended theme park in the United States with 1.99 million guests. AstroWorld attendance ranked 35th overall among all theme parks in 2000, 37th overall in 2002, 36th overall in 2003, and 39th overall in 2004, which was eighth among all Six Flags parks in 2004. A contractual agreement that allowed Six Flags patrons to park at Reliant Stadium expired in August 2005, and attempts to extend it failed. CFO Jim Dannhauser cited the expired parking arrangement as a &quot;contributing factor&quot; in the decision to close. Burke later explained in 2014 the decision was based on &quot;[AstroWorld&#x27;s] condition and location and the costs to modernize ... we had big offers pouring in for the land at the time and it just made more sense to close it.&quot; The final date of park operation was October 30, 2005. Following the closure, most of the park&#x27;s assets, including rides and equipment, were sold during a three-day public auction held January 6–8, 2006.
Company executives expected to sell the land for as much as $150 million, but ultimately received less than half that amount. After spending $20 million to demolish the park and clear the land, Six Flags sold the cleared property for $77 million in 2006 to Angel/McIver Interests, a land development firm based in Conroe, Texas. By that time, Burke had been removed as CEO. In 2009, the former Astroworld site was still vacant. The land tract was reported as taking up . The land owners hired real estate consultants, Croswell Torian Commercial Properties, to subdivide and market the property to other developers under the &quot;SouthPoint&quot; brand, though no development had yet occurred. The original tract purchased by Hofheinz was reduced by : were acquired by Harris County Metro and another piece of the tract on the northwest corner sold to a car dealership.

The Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo (HLSR) are the owners of a record-holding of cleared land bounded by West Bellfort Drive, Fannin Street, Kirby Drive, and I-610. The original amusement park site occupied of that. Parts of the tract were developed, and other parts were undeveloped; the HLSR was using some of that property for overflow parking and conveying those visitors over the long pedestrian viaduct, the last remnant of the former amusement park. Though the site includes a great field of grass, the land is stabilized and partly paved with asphalt, so it can be used for parking.

==Areas and attractions==

There were ten themed areas by the early 1980s. WaterWorld, an adjacent water park built in 1983, became part of AstroWorld in 2002. The park&#x27;s outdoor concert venue, the Southern Star Amphitheatre, opened in 1980. Well-known musicians and bands performed at the amphitheater over the years, including The Beach Boys, the Grateful Dead, and Bob Dylan.

At the time the park closed, the themed areas were:
* WaterWorld
* Oriental Village (originally &quot;Oriental Corner&quot;)
* Mexicana (originally &quot;Plaza de Fiesta&quot;; included &quot;Children&#x27;s World&quot;, which was removed to install XLR-8 in 1984)
* Nottingham Village (1972 expansion initially named &quot;Country Fair&quot;; renamed in 1981)
* Western Junction
* Americana Square
* European Village (originally included &quot;Alpine Valley&quot;)
* USA (originally &quot;Mod Ville&quot;; &quot;Coney Island&quot; expansion (featuring Texas Cyclone) added in 1976; later renamed &quot;International Plaza&quot; in 1977)

===Ride history===
The Alpine Sleigh Ride, Astrowheel, and Mill Pond were among the park&#x27;s original sixteen rides. The Alpine Sleigh Ride &quot;[took] passengers in roller coasters fashion over a mountain and through snow storms and waterfalls&quot;. Its opening was delayed by three weeks after the park&#x27;s opening day. The water skimmer ride Mill Pond was not operational on opening day for mechanical reasons as well as the late arrival of two &quot;water bug&quot; cars. The Black Dragon debuted within the first year.

To compensate for the humidity in Houston, the park included more than 2,400 tons of cooling with vents in the shaded areas of the park, which AstroWorld called &quot;the largest outdoor air conditioning system in the world&quot; at its opening. Additional air conditioning systems were fitted to the Alpine Sleighs, blowing gusts of refrigerated air over guests at .

The &quot;610 Limited&quot; was the park&#x27;s perimeter railroad, originally operating two steam locomotives, each -scale 4-4-0, which were built by Guiberson-Harpur Corp., a company owned by famed live steam builder and Walt Disney imagineer Bob Harpur. Each original train had an engine, tender, and four cars for a capacity of 250 passengers, carrying them at speeds up to over of track. The No. 2 train was sold for scrap to Gary Norton in 1986 and served at Silverwood Theme Park briefly before the engine was sold to private owners and restored in Georgetown, California; the coaches remain in service at Silverwood. No. 1 remained in limited operation after diesel locomotives were relocated from Six Flags Magic Mountain; after AstroWorld closed, No. 1 was sold in January 2006, restored, and returned to service on the Pacific Coast Railroad at Santa Margarita Ranch in April as &quot;Caroline&quot;. In addition, Harper Goff designed a custom railcar for Judge Hofheinz, named the &quot;Astrodoma&quot;, designed to run on the same tracks; it was stored alongside its locomotive in 1976 after the park was sold to Six Flags, and remained undisturbed before it was sold in 2018.


Bamboo Shoot (a log flume later named Ozarka Splash) and the Serpent junior coaster were installed in 1969. Bamboo Shoot took riders on a course at speeds up to ; each of the 25 boats carried four adults or six children. Serpent carried 24 passengers on a track in six cars. The Alpine Carousel (also known as the Dentzel Carousel, after its manufacturer) in Alpine Village also was added for the 1969 season. It was originally built in 1895 and operated from 1907 to 1967 in Forest Park (formerly Eichelberger Park) in Hanover, Pennsylvania. After Forest Park was sold to make way for a shopping center, AstroWorld purchased the carousel and moved it to Houston. It retained its original pipe organ and drums, and the menagerie of animals included lions, ostriches, pigs, camels, horses, rabbits, giraffes, and tigers. Some animals on the outside ring were swapped from a D. C. Muller and Bros. carousel that had previously operated at Pen Mar Park between 1907 and 1943; August Karst operated both the Pen Mar and Forest parks. The Brass Ring Carousel Company of Sun Valley, California, purchased the carousel before the 2006 auction of AstroWorld assets, and restored it for a private museum.

The Swamp Buggy (a dark ride with a drop over a spiral track &quot;wrapped around a huge tree&quot;), Magnetic House (a fun house) and a wooden bridge were added for the 1970 season to an island (themed &quot;Fun Island&quot;) in the lagoon between the Astroneedle and Plaza de Fiesta. The first major park expansion opened in 1972 with a new area themed &quot;Country Fair&quot; between Americana Square and Oriental Corner. Country Fair included typical midway attractions and the first major roller coaster in the park, the Dexter Frebish Electric Roller Ride (renamed &quot;Excalibur&quot; in 1981 with the retheming of the expansion to Nottingham Village). The park added a second antique carousel at this time in Country Fair, originally built in 1907 by Borelli. Installed in 1976 as part of the &quot;Coney Island&quot; expansion, Texas Cyclone was among the largest wooden roller coasters in the U.S. and featured a drop at 53 degrees, achieving a speed of . During construction, a tropical storm damaged a portion of the ride, delaying its opening. After the park closed, the coaster&#x27;s trains were relocated to La Ronde. Greezed Lightnin&#x27;, installed in 1978, could accelerate from 0 to in four seconds. Joe Bob Briggs (writing under his given name, John Bloom) covered the looping coaster in &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; that year, noting the ride only lasts 28 seconds, adding the second half of the ride is carried out in reverse: &quot;If there is anything more frightening than entering a 360-degree loop in a coaster car, it is entering a 360-degree loop &quot;backwards&quot; in a coaster car&quot;.

Thunder River, installed in 1980, has been described as the &quot;first commercially successful river-rapids ride&quot;. Warp 10 took over the former site of the Astrowheel in 1981; it was later moved to Plaza de Fiesta in 1987 and renamed Warp 2000. Warp 2000 was operating as Crazy Legs at Six Flags Over Texas in Arlington, as of 2016. The ten-story Sky Screamer debuted in 1983. Louis B. Parks of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; said of the ride at the time: &quot;After being shot to the top of the tower in a super fast elevator ride, you are now about to free fall back to the bottom. As you reach the base of the tower, several weeks ahead of your stomach, you will be swooshed along a curving track, changing your horizon and your bearings, and braked to a quick stop while lying on your back.&quot; In 2013, the newspaper&#x27;s J. R. Gonzalez recalled, this &quot;crash course in physics ... wasn&#x27;t as scary as the Texas Cyclone, nor as drenching as Thunder River, but it did make for a quick thrill&quot;. AstroWorld removed the ride during the 1990s. XLR-8 was installed in 1984. Looping Starship was installed in 1986. Arrow-Huss originally manufactured Tidal Wave as &quot;Shoot the Chute&quot; for the 1984 World&#x27;s Fair in New Orleans. Six Flags purchased the ride after the fair&#x27;s bankruptcy and installed it at AstroWorld in 1988, replacing the Lost World riverboat ride. It was described as &quot;a flume designed to plunge passengers down a series of slides in a small boat&quot; and &quot;dependent upon a stream of pumped water&quot;.

Ultra Twister was installed in 1990. The ride stood nine stories tall and had a vertical drop followed by a series of barrel rolls. Mayan Mindbender was installed originally as Nightmare at Boblo Island in 1995, becoming the park&#x27;s first indoor roller coaster. The coaster was housed inside a Mayan pyramid. The ride&#x27;s trains had twelve cars made by the Dutch company Vekoma, with T-bars used as restraints. In 2004, Josh Harkinson of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; wrote, &quot;the coaster resembles Indiana Jones skiing Space Mountain: It caroms in total darkness inside a faux Mayan temple. Teens are delightfully horrified.&quot; In 2019, the newspaper&#x27;s Jef Rouner opined, &quot;The line setting was fantastic, too. It wound through a jungle past skeletons in crashed jeeps and was probably the best themed wait outside of Batman: The Escape.&quot; The ride later operated as The Hornet at Amarillo&#x27;s Wonderland Park. In 1997, AstroWorld added , an Intamin drop tower, to Nottingham Village; that ride let passengers fall, reaching approximately in three seconds, before slowing the descent via large magnets. The ride&#x27;s entry was based on a medieval torture chamber. It was repainted and operated as Superman: Tower of Power at Six Flags St. Louis. It closed at the end of the 2020 season and was demolished during the 2021 season. Serial Thriller originally operated at AstroWorld starting in 1999. The ride was placed into storage in 2005 and began operating as Ednör at La Ronde in 2010.

SWAT opened in 2003 in Plaza de Fiesta, along with Diablo Falls, a spinning rapids ride; after the closure of AstroWorld, both rides were relocated to Six Flags New England as Catapult and Splash Water Falls, respectively. S&amp;S Worldwide manufactured SWAT, and only two rides of this type were built; the other was installed at Thorpe Park in England.

===List of roller coasters===
== WaterWorld ==
WaterWorld, Houston&#x27;s first water park, opened in June 1983. Although it shared an entrance with AstroWorld, a separate $8.95 admission charge was required for entry; by comparison, the one-day ticket price for AstroWorld at the time was $12.50.

The 1.9 million-gallon water park featured a wave pool called Breaker Beach. According to the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;, other attractions included the Lagoon, &quot;a lush swimming area with waterfalls and diving platforms&quot;. Water slides included Wipe-Out, Typhoon, Tidal Wave, and Hurricane, which offered twisting and turning rides as long as while patrons slid back down to earth. Wipe-Out, in particular, had a vertical drop of over a straight length and claimed to accelerate riders to . &quot;Squirt&#x27;s Splash was strictly for the kids and parents with water pistols and mazes. Runaway River was an attraction that saw riders float through a series of pools and thrilling drops that eventually lead back to the Lagoon.&quot; Two rides were added to the park in 1999, including Big Kahuna.

Peak attendance reached approximately 20,000 people on Saturdays. AstroWorld and WaterWorld merged in 2002.

==Events==
The park&#x27;s Southern Star Amphitheater opened in 1980 and hosted a variety of performers, including The Beach Boys, The Cure, Destiny&#x27;s Child, Bob Dylan, the Grateful Dead, Heart (1985), Billy Idol, The Monkees, and Selena. The music video for the Debbie Gibson song &quot;Staying Together&quot; was filmed at the concert venue in 1987. The venue hosted music festivals such as Joyfest, featuring Christian groups Jars of Clay and Point of Grace (1990s).

Six Flags AstroWorld originated the &quot;Fright Nights&quot; special event for the Halloween season in 1986, designed to help drive attendance during the otherwise light fall season. The event was renamed &quot;Fright Fest&quot; in 1993, and continued until the park closed in 2005. Holiday in the Park was held around Christmas. The park had other seasonal attractions, like Alice Cooper&#x27;s Brutal Planet. The singer also performed at AstroWorld.

==Personnel==
Dan Dunn and Jeff Martin worked as a caricaturists at the park. Daniel Johnston operated River of No Return.

In 2018, former employees organized the AstroWorld 50th Anniversary Employee Reunion.

==Media and legacy==
On December 28, 1968, ABC aired the children&#x27;s television special &quot;The Pied Piper of Astroworld&quot;, starring Soupy Sales, Lesley Gore, and Kenny Rogers and The First Edition, featuring Patrick Swayze in a bear costume and The Muppets. Robert Altman directed Bud Cort as a reclusive inventor living in the Astrodome for the cult classic film &quot;Brewster McCloud&quot;, released in 1970, with scenes from AstroWorld including the Lost World Adventure riverboat ride.

The model of AstroWorld built by Ed Henderson in 1967 was displayed publicly again at the Houston Public Library Central Library&#x27;s Julia Ideson Building starting in 2011. In 2016, the library announced the model would be exhibited there permanently.

In 2015, the bar Moving Sidewalk launched an AstroWorld-themed cocktail menu.

American rapper and singer Travis Scott, born and raised in Houston, called his third studio album &quot;Astroworld&quot; (2018) to commemorate his hometown. In an &quot;XXL&quot; interview, he said of the park&#x27;s closure and demolition, &quot;They took AstroWorld away from us in Houston.&quot; Scott announced a festival taking Astroworld&#x27;s name for 2018. Scott mentioned one of the motivations of the festival was to &quot;bring back the beloved spirit and nostalgia of AstroWorld, making a childhood dream of Travis&#x27; come true&quot;.

In 2019, Craig Hlavaty of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; called the Astroneedle a Houston landmark.

<text>The 39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (39th IBCT), also officially known as The Arkansas Brigade, is an infantry brigade combat team of the Army National Guard composed of personnel from the U.S. states of Arkansas, Missouri, and Nebraska. The unit is the largest Army National Guard command in Arkansas and is headquartered at the Camp Robinson Maneuver Training Center. It was ordered into federal service in 2003 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom II. The 39th was attached to the 1st Cavalry Division and served in and around Baghdad for a year, returning to the United States in March 2005.

In late August 2005, after Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast of the United States, elements of the 39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team were among the first military units to provide recovery and relief efforts to citizens of New Orleans, Louisiana. The brigade combat team led the effort to evacuate an estimated 16,000 people from the New Orleans Convention Center. The 39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team completed its second deployment to Iraq in 2008, after spending a year on active federal duty. Unlike the first deployment, the brigade combat team did not have command and control of all its subordinate units.

==History==
===20th century===
====World War I====
The unit was organized for service in World War I on 25 August 1917 at Camp Beauregard, Louisiana as the 39th Division (Delta Division) from National Guard troops of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Arkansas. It arrived in France during August and September 1918. Upon arrival the division was sent to the St. Florent area south-west of Bourges where it was designated as a replacement division. On 2 November it moved to St. Aignan and the personnel of most of the units was withdrawn and sent to other organizations leaving the 39th Division skeletonized. With one exception the units of the division did not participate in combat operations, although a large number of the personnel was transferred to combat divisions, and took part in operations. The 114th Engineers participated as a unit in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive from 3 October – 11 November 1918. The 39th Division permanent cadre returned to the United States in December 1918. It demobilized the following month at Camp Beauregard. In 1923, when the 39th Division was redesignated the 31st Division (Dixie Division), its Arkansas units were transferred from the division and continued to operate as non-divisional units. For a history of those units, see articles on the 153d Infantry and the 206th Coast Artillery.

====Cold War====
On 26 August 1947, the unit was reorganized and federally recognized in part at Little Rock as the 39th Infantry Division. During this period the division included the 153d Infantry Regiment, the 156th Infantry Regiment, and the 206th Field Artillery Regiment. On 2 November 1967, the division was reorganized again and subsequently redesignated the 39th Infantry Brigade. This change resulted in a massive restationing within the state as follows:

In 1967 the division was redesignated as the 39th Infantry Brigade (Separate) and in 1973 was paired with the US 101st Airborne Division as a training partner and became an air-assault brigade. The following Regiments were represented in the 39th Infantry Brigade (Separate): 153d Infantry Regiment, 151st Cavalry Regiment and the 206th Field Artillery Regiment. 39th Brigade units conducted numerous overseas training rotations throughout the 1980s and early 1990s.

====1990s====
In 1994 the brigade was again reorganized and gained its designation as an &quot;enhanced&quot; brigade. In 1999, the 39th became part of the 7th Infantry Division under the Army Integrated Division concept which paired National Guard and Reserve brigades with active duty headquarters and support units.

Company B, 2d Battalion, 153d Infantry Regiment, and Company B, 3d Battalion, 153d Infantry Regiment of the 39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team were activated for Operation Southern Watch, May through September 1999. Company B, 2d Battalion, 153d Infantry Regiment deployed to Kuwait while Company B, 3d Battalion, 153d Infantry Regiment deployed to Prince Sultan Air Base, Saudi Arabia. Soldiers provided security at Patriot missile batteries during these deployments. The mission lasted a total of seven months, and was the first &quot;pure&quot; National Guard effort in the region. Company C, 1st Battalion, 153d Infantry carried on the 39th&#x27;s role in Operation Southern Watch when they replaced Company B, 2d Battalion, 153d Infantry Regiment in September 1999.

Company B, 3d Battalion, 153d Infantry Regiment was the first National Guard unit since the Vietnam War to be involuntarily mobilized by presidential order (President Bill Clinton). The unit was mobilized to support operations in Operation Southern Watch. The battalion commander was Lieutenant Colonel Ewing, company commander was Captain Rozenberg and the company first sergeant was First Sergeant Nutt. B Company consisted of over 120 soldiers from the Camden and Fordyce units and volunteers from other areas of south and central Arkansas. The unit primarily provided security for two active duty Army Patriot missile batteries in Saudi Arabia. The units conducted initial training for the deployment in Camp Joseph T. Robinson, Arkansas and Fort Carson, Colorado. The success of the mission laid the ground work for additional deployments of National Guard units.

===21st century===
In March 2001, Company D, 1st Battalion, 153d Infantry Regiment and Company D, 3d Battalion, 153d Infantry Regiment deployed to Bosnia as part of the Multinational Stabilization Force (SFOR), Security Force Nine in order to assist with the enforcement of the mandate of the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH). The companies were attached to 3d Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment, 3d Infantry Division for the deployment as part of Task Force Eagle. They performed presence patrols outside Forward Operating Base Morgan and Camp McGovern, and participated in the consolidation of weapon storage sites. The soldiers also guarded the sites.

====War on Terrorism====
On 8 October 2001, 2d Battalion, 153d Infantry Regiment was activated. Second Battalion was sent to Egypt in order to take over the Multinational Force and Observers mission, freeing up regular army infantry units to deploy to Afghanistan. The 2d Battalion, 153d Infantry Regiment mission during the MFO was: &quot;...to supervise the implementation of the security provisions of the Egyptian-Israeli Treaty of Peace and employ best efforts to prevent any violation of its terms.&quot; This mission was accomplished by carrying out four tasks: operating checkpoints, observation posts and conducting reconnaissance patrols on the international border as well as within Zone C; verification of the terms of the peace treaty not less than twice a month; verification of the terms of the peace treaty within 48 hours, upon the request of either party, and ensuring freedom of international marine navigation in the Strait of Tiran and access to the Gulf of Aqaba. This was the first &quot;pure&quot; National Guard takeover of the MFO mission. 2d Battalion, 153d Infantry Regiment deactivated on 11 October 2002.

The 39th Infantry Brigade was notified in 2002 that it would be participating in a rotation to the Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Polk, Louisiana. For National Guard brigades, a rotation is actually a three-year process that provides additional money, resources and training opportunities in order to improve unit readiness before the actual rotation through the Joint Readiness Training Center. The brigade was required to complete a mission rehearsal exercise during the 2003 annual training which was conducted at Fort Chaffee, Arkansas. Less than a month after the completion of this major training milestone, the brigade received its alert for deployment to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom on 28 July 2003.

On 12 October 2003, the brigade, commanded by Brigadier General Ronald Chastain, was ordered to federal service in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom for a period of up to 18 months. The brigade conducted post mobilization training at Fort Hood, Texas from October 2003 until January 2004. In January the brigade shipped its vehicles and equipment to Iraq from Fort Hood, and then moved to Fort Polk for a Mission Rehearsal Exercise at the Joint Readiness Training Center. On 17 February 2004, President George W. Bush visited the brigade and had an MRE (Meal, Ready-to-Eat) lunch in a field mess tent with soldiers. After lunch, President Bush made brief remarks to the soldiers.

When the brigade combat team received its alert, it was approximately 700 soldiers short of its authorized end strength. This shortage was due in large part to the way new recruits are accounted for in the National Guard. In the active Army a new recruit only comes to a unit and is counted on its books after the soldier has completed Basic Combat Training and Advanced Individual Training. In the National Guard, the new recruit is counted on the unit&#x27;s strength reports as soon as the Soldier signs their contract. The brigade combat team had over 500 soldiers who had not completed either Basic or Advanced Individual Training upon alert.

This shortage led to the decision to consolidate the available manning into two infantry battalions that would be supplied for the brigade by the Arkansas National Guard and to ask the National Guard Bureau to provide the third infantry battalion. Because of the 2002 deployment of the 2d Battalion, 153d Infantry Regiment to the MFO, the battalion was deemed non-deployable as an organization; however, the soldiers of the battalion were to deploy. The decision was made by BG Chastain to transfer the battalion commander and staff from 2d Battalion, 153d Infantry Regiment to 3d Battalion, 153d Infantry Regiment. The 3d Battalion, 153d Infantry Regiment commander and staff were transferred to 2d Battalion, 153d Infantry Regiment and were designated to function as the brigade&#x27;s rear detachment during Operation Iraqi Freedom. This transfer led to the 3d Battalion, 153d Infantry Regiment often being referred to as the two-thirds (2/3) battalion by personnel of the brigade. 3d Battalion, 153d Infantry Regiment adopted the 2d Battalion, 153d Infantry Regiment nickname and call sign, &quot;Gunslingers&quot; for Operation Iraqi Freedom.

National Guard Bureau met the brigade&#x27;s need for additional soldiers by alerting 2d Battalion, 162d Infantry Regiment, from the Oregon National Guard; a platoon of Company B, 1st Battalion, 108th Infantry Regiment, New York National Guard; a platoon of Company C, 1st Battalion, 102d Infantry Regiment from the Connecticut National Guard; the 1115th Transportation Company and elements of the 642d Maintenance Company from the New Mexico Army National Guard; elements of 629th Military Intelligence Battalion from the Maryland National Guard; elements of HHSC, 233d Military Intelligence Company, California National Guard; and, Battery A, 1st Battalion, 103d Field Artillery, Rhode Island National Guard to round out the brigade and bring it to its full deployment strength of 3700 soldiers. With the addition of Company A, 28th Signal Battalion, from the Pennsylvania National Guard, the brigade included National Guard soldiers from ten states.

The brigade&#x27;s mission during Operation Iraqi Freedom was to conduct full-spectrum operations focused on stability and support operations and to secure key terrain in and around Baghdad, supported by focused and fully integrated information (IO) and civil-military operations, in order to enable the progressive transfer of authority to the Iraqi people, their institutions and a legitimate Iraqi national government. The lines of operation as established by 1st Cavalry Division included: combat operations; train and equip security forces; essential services; promote governance; and, economic pluralism, with information operations interconnected throughout. The end state envisioned by Maj. Gen. Peter W. Chiarelli of these full spectrum operations was a secure and stable environment for Iraqis, maintained by indigenous police and security forces under the direction of a legitimate, national government that is freely elected and accepts economic pluralism.

The 39th Infantry Brigade relieved the 1st Brigade, 1st Armored Division in the Baghdad neighborhoods of Adhamiyah and Rusafa as well as elements of 3rd Brigade, 1st Armored Division at Camp Taji. This relief in place took place in the midst of a multiparty insurgency uprising. The brigade&#x27;s convoys were heavily opposed during the convoy north. The brigade was task organized with 1st Battalion, 153d Infantry Regiment being detached to 3d Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division, in exchange for the attachment of 2d Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment, of George Armstrong Custer and LZ Albany fame, to the brigade. The 1st Battalion, 153d Infantry Regiment was headquartered in the Green Zone in Baghdad with the 3d Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division. The 39th Infantry Brigade headquarters, 239 MI Company, 239 Engineer Company, 2d Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment and 1st Battalion, 206th Field Artillery Regiment were stationed at Camp Cooke in Taji, Iraq.

The 2d Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment controlled a massive area of operations that stretched from just north of the Baghdad City Gate, north along Iraqi Highway 1, (Main Supply Route Tampa]]) to the city of Mushada, bounded on the east by the Tigris River, and stretching west to the boundary with the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, approximately east of Fallujah. This Area of Operations was twice assumed by 1st Battalion, 206th Field Artillery Regiment when 2d Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment was detached from the brigade. 2d Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment was tasked with providing a Military Assistance Training Team to Company D, 307th Iraq National Guard Battalion, based in Mushada, Iraq.

The 1st Battalion, 206th Field Artillery Regiment provided fires in support of brigade combat operations from Camp Taji; functioned as the base defense operations center for Camp Taji, manned the main entry control point (ECP) for Camp Taji; provided convoy and VIP escorts; and, controlled a small area of operations south of Camp Taji between Iraqi Highway 1 and the Tigris River. On two occasions 1st Battalion, 206th Field Artillery Regiment became responsible for the entire area of operations assigned to the 2d Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment. The 1st Battalion, 206th Field Artillery Regiment Field Artillery was also tasked with providing a military assistance training team to the Headquarters and Companies A, B, and C of the 307th Iraqi National Guard Battalion, which was also stationed at Camp Taji. The 307th was the only Iraqi army element stationed on the Coalition Forces side of Camp Taji.

The 3d Battalion, 153d Infantry Regiment was stationed at FOB Gunslinger (aka FOB Solidarity), in the Adhamiyah neighborhood of Baghdad which lies immediately to the west of Sadr City. Additionally the battalion was charged with patrolling a large area of operations that stretched north from Baghdad along the east side of the Tigris River, and included the city of Hussainiyah, a town of 500,000 about 12 miles north of Baghdad. the battalion was tasked with providing a military assistance training team to support the Headquarters and Companies C and D of the 301st Iraqi National Guard Battalion, and Company C, 102d Iraqi National Guard Battalion.

The 2d Battalion, 162d Infantry Regiment was stationed at FOB Volunteer in the Rusafa neighborhood of Baghdad which lies to the south of Sadr City. The battalion was tasked with supplying a military assistance training team to Companies A and B, of the 301st Iraqi National Guard Battalion.

In April 2004 the 39th came under rocket attack at Camp Cooke in Taji, resulting in four Arkansas soldiers killed in action, all members of the 39th Support Battalion, headquartered in Hazen. The 24 April attack resulted in the highest single day casualty total for Arkansas soldiers since the Korean War. Members of Company C, 1st Battalion, 153d Infantry Regiment spent weeks fighting as part of Task Force 1–9 CAV, 3rd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division on the hotly contested area of Haifa Street in Baghdad.

The 2d Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment, including 1st Platoon, Company C, 3d Battalion, 153d Infantry Regiment was twice detached from the 39th Infantry Brigade to act as the corps reserve. In August 2004, the squadron was detached from Multi National Division-Baghdad to Multi National Division-South as part of the Battle of Najaf (2004). In November 2004, the squadron was attached to the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force to take part in the Second Battle of Fallujah.

The 3d Battalion, 153d Infantry Regiment provided security to two massive Shiite marches to the Khadamiyah Shrine which were staged through Sunni neighborhoods. They were accompanied by very little violence due to the battalion&#x27;s work with Iraqi National Guard and Iraqi Police officials.

On 3 October 2004, Staff Sergeant Christopher Potts (Battery A, 1–103rd FA) and Sergeant Russell &quot;Doc&quot; Collier, from 1st Battalion, 206th Field Artillery were killed in a fire fight with insurgents near the village of Musurraf, south of Camp Taji along the Tigris River. Sergeant Collier was posthumously awarded the Silver Star for his actions when he moved forward under heavy enemy fire in order to render aid to Staff Sergeant Potts who had been shot while attempting to silence an enemy automatic weapon. Staff Sergeant Potts was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star Medal with V Device for his actions.

On 14 November 2004, a patrol of 307th Iraqi National Guard Soldiers with an adviser team from 1st Battalion, 206th Field Artillery led by Captain John Vanlandingham, and an escort platoon from B Company, 3d Battalion, 153d Infantry Regiment was ambushed north of Mushada, Iraq. Vanlandingham received the Silver Star medal for his actions to save several wounded Iraqi Army soldiers who had become separated from the patrol during the ambush. Vanlandingham repeatedly exposed himself to enemy fire in order to carry wounded Iraqi soldiers to safety.

The most coordinated enemy attack the brigade had seen occurred on 20 November 2004 when twenty-six soldiers of Company C, 3d Battalion, 153d Infantry Regiment Infantry were ambushed near Fort Apache in North Baghdad. They fended off over 100 insurgents for several hours without ammunition resupply or support. The platoon leader, First Lieutenant Michael McCarty, despite being wounded, endured intense enemy direct fire and personally neutralized an enemy machine gun emplacement without support. Lieutenant McCarty received the Silver Star for going above and beyond the call of duty.

The 1st Battalion, 153d Infantry Regiment conducted over 8,200 combat patrols, captured six division targets and contained or disrupted 15 vehicle borne improvised explosive device (VBIED) attacks in their sector. The battalion worked to suppress indirect fire attacks on the International Zone during the Transfer of Iraqi Sovereignty and weekly Iraqi National Congress meetings. Lieutenant Colonel Kendall Penn, battalion commander, also worked closely with the Karahda District Counsel to oversee over six million dollars of infrastructure and community improvement projects in the battalion&#x27;s area of operations.

The 39th Infantry Brigade was instrumental in the January 2005 elections. The brigade was responsible for the establishment and security of 20 different polling sites within the brigade&#x27;s area of operations. In order to avoid jeopardizing the credibility of the election process, it was necessary to avoid a Coalition Force presence at the polling sites. This meant that the security at the polling sites would be the responsibility of the New Iraqi Army units for which the 39th was responsible. 39th Brigade leaders spent countless hours planning and coordination with Iraqi counterpart units and governmental elections officials, and not one polling site in the 39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team area of operations was disrupted or forced to close.

The members of the 239th Engineer Company stationed in Camp Cooke and their families back in Arkansas were the subject of a TV documentary series that aired on the Discovery Times channel called &quot;Off To War&quot;. The 39th was also covered by embedded reporter Amy Schlesing of the &quot;Arkansas Democrat Gazette&quot; for the entire time in Iraq. The definitive work on the 39th Brigade&#x27;s first deployment to Iraq was published by the Arkansas Democrat Gazette. The work entitled &quot;The Bowie Brigade, Arkansas National Guard&#x27;s 39th Infantry Brigade in Iraq&quot; was published in 2005 and is a collection of the work of Ms. Schlesing and the embedded writers and photographers who accompanied the brigade: Statnon Breidenthal, Karen E. Segrave, Arron Skinner, Stephen B. Thorton and Michael Woods.

The 39th Infantry Brigade was relieved in place by the 3d Brigade, 1st Armored Division, on 12 March 2005, which was the same unit that the 1st Battalion, 206th Field Artillery Regiment had relieved at Camp Taji on 24 March 2004. During the deployment the 39th Infantry Brigade suffered a total of thirty six killed in action, including soldiers from attached units. Sixteen of those killed in action were members of the Arkansas National Guard. Members of the brigade were awarded three Silver Stars, dozens of Bronze Star Medals and Army Commendation Medals with V device and over 250 Purple Heart Medals. In the March 2005, units of the brigade started their rotation back to Fort Carson, Colorado, Fort Hood, Texas, and Fort Sill, Oklahoma for demobilization.

The following units were task organized under the 39th Infantry Brigade Team during Operation Iraqi Freedom II

1st Battalion, 153d Infantry Regiment was task organized under 3d Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Upon redeployment in 2005, the brigade immediately began a major reorganization that transformed the brigade from an enhanced separate brigade to an infantry brigade combat team under the U.S. Army&#x27;s new Modular Design. This redesign of the army was intended to make the force more easily deployable by making brigades more self contained and less dependent on support organizations at the division level. Major changes for the brigade included: Transition from a brigadier general to a colonel as brigade commander; Deactivation of 3d Battalion, 153d Infantry Regiment; Deactivation of Troop E, 151st Cavalry Regiment; Deactivation of Battery C, 1st Battalion, 206th Field Artillery Regiment; Activation of 1st Squadron, 151st Cavalry Regiment, with headquarters at Warren; Activation of the Special Troops Battalion, 39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, with headquarters at Conway; Activation of four new forward support companies, D, E, F and G under the 39th Brigade Support Battalion; Reorganization of 239th MI Company as Company B, Special Troops Battalion, 39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team; Reorganization of 239th Engineer Company as Company A, Special Troops Battalion, 39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team; Activation of Company C, Special Troops Battalion, 39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team. Along with this reorganization came a significant re-stationing of several units within the state of Arkansas.

After Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana in August 2005, elements of the brigade combat team deployed to New Orleans by C-130s from the Little Rock Air Force Base to support the relief and recovery efforts as part of Operation Katrina. Under tactical control of the Louisiana National Guard, 39th soldiers were given the mission of providing security and food and water to an estimated 20,000 people at the New Orleans Convention Center on 2 September. By the afternoon of 3 September, all individuals staying in and around the Convention Center had been evacuated. The mission of the 39th in Louisiana grew to the point that at one time the brigade combat team was responsible for working with local officials in fourteen parishes. Elements of the 39th and the Arkansas National Guard stayed deployed in Louisiana until February 2006.

In 2006, the 7th Infantry Division was deactivated and the brigade combat team was placed under the command and control of the 36th Infantry Division. In June 2006 the brigade combat team began deploying troops along the Southwest Border with Mexico as part of Operation Jump Start. The brigade combat team manned two sectors of the border around Lordsburg and near Deming, New Mexico. Personnel occupied observation posts and reported activity along the border to the United States Border Patrol. Various battalions within the brigade combat team were tasked with supplying volunteer companies during this period. Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 1st Battalion, 206th Field Artillery manned the Deming station from December 2006 through June 2007. While serving in Operation Jump Start, personnel from the brigade combat team were able to begin preparing for the brigade combat team&#x27;s second deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

The First and Second Arkansas were stationed in the same part of New Mexico 90 years earlier during John J. Pershing&#x27;s punitive Mexican Expedition against Pancho Villa.
In April 2007, the 39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team received an alert for a second deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The brigade combat team had been home almost exactly two years since demobilizing after Operation Iraqi Freedom. This deployment would be dramatically different from the first. Instead of deploying as a brigade combat team, the brigade was tasked with filling 28 unit requests for forces. These taskings involved supplying convoy security companies, force protection companies, base defense operations center and garrison command cells. Additionally, instead of an 18-month mobilization, with 12 months actually deployed to Iraq like the first tour, this mobilization would be for a total of 12 months, with approximately 10 months being deployed to the combat theater.

Once again the unit found itself with a shortage of personnel to fill these taskings. Many of these shortages were caused by unresolved medical issues from the first deployment. This time the Arkansas National Guard decided not to ask for outside support, but met the brigade combat team&#x27;s need for personnel by task organizing the 217th Brigade Support Battalion from the 142d Fires Brigade, and three companies from the 87th Troop Command to the brigade combat team for this deployment. The brigade combat team was placed on duty in October 2007 to prepare for its second deployment to Iraq while still under state control. It began a 90-day pre-mobilization training period at Fort Chaffee Maneuver Training Center on 1 October 2007. This allowed the unit to perform certain tasks in Arkansas and allowed unit members to be closer to their families for a longer period of time.

The brigade combat team was placed in federal service in January 2008 and trained at Camp Shelby, Mississippi until it deployed to Iraq beginning in March 2008. Upon reaching their final destinations, most of the brigade combat team elements fell under the tactical command of Regular Army units, primarily the 4th Infantry Division and the 3rd Sustainment Command (Expeditionary). The brigade combat team and its subordinate battalions retained administrative control (ADCON) of all team elements.

While deployed in Iraq from April to December 2008, the headquarters of the brigade combat team assumed the mission as the base defense operations cell for Victory Base Camp (VBC) in Baghdad, Iraq, responsible for the security of over 65,000 coalition soldiers and civilians. With this mission, the brigade combat team headquarters managed and coordinated the security of four subordinate camps and area defense operation centers (ADOCs), to include: Camp Victory, Camp Striker, Camp Slayer, and Camp Liberty. The brigade combat team headquarters managed entry control and personnel processing at four major entry control points and processed over 2,500 local national workers each day. In addition to internal base security, the brigade combat team managed terrain outside the perimeter in order to better provide defense in depth, as well as improve quality of life for Iraqi population centers adjacent to VBC. These responsibilities also included the Baghdad International Airport (BIAP) that was located in the center of VBC. The brigade combat team, in partnership with its subordinate units, coordinated nearly ten million dollars in projects that benefited local Iraqi communities.

During this same time period, the brigade combat team invested over twenty-one million dollars in base defense improvement to VBC, to include improved towers, barriers, fencing, perimeter lighting, road improvement, water projects, and general force protection initiatives. The brigade combat team was also charged with providing command and control for the Counter-RAM, Joint Intercept Battery, a system used to destroy incoming artillery, rockets and mortar rounds in the air before they hit their ground targets. For their efforts, the headquarters, brigade combat team received the Meritorious Unit Citation (MUC) from the commander, 4th Infantry Division. The brigade combat team&#x27;s task organization for the base defense operations cell mission was:

Task Force 1st Battalion, 153d Infantry Regiment consisted of a Headquarters Company, a Joint Visitor&#x27;s Bureau Company, a Personal Security Detachment Troop and two Base Defense Companies. The task force was responsible for the force protection and defense of Camp Slayer and the Radwiniya Palace Complex within the Victory Base Camp. The Task Force 1st Battalion, 153d Infantry Regiment searched over 10,000 cars and 35,600 Iraqis to ensure no threats penetrated the perimeter. Soldiers assigned to Task Force 1st Battalion, 153d Infantry Regiment executed 996 combat patrols in the area of operations surrounding Camp Slayer and captured six high-value targets.

Task Force 2d Battalion, 153d Infantry Regiment was stationed in Al Asad Airbase, Iraq and was organized as a convoy security battalion. The battalion provided convoy security to theater sustainment convoys using the Jordan Line of Communications from Trebil to Al Asad and Forward Operating Base TQ. The unit conducted seventy six combat logistical patrols, four to six days in length, driving over 1,587,000 miles. Task Force 2d Battalion, 153d Infantry Regiment experienced one casualty during Operation Iraqi Freedom when an escort vehicle was accidentally struck while providing security at an intersection by one of the escorted vehicles.

Task Force 1st Squadron, 151st Cavalry Regiment, based at Tallil Airbase, consisted of over 800 soldiers assigned to six companies/troops/batteries consisting of active and reserve components. Task Force 1st Squadron, 151st Cavalry Regiment conducted over 700 tactical convoy security missions, without losing a single soldier due to enemy activity. The task force was responsible for long haul fuel mission between Tallil Air Base, Logistical Base Sitz, Taji and Balad Air Base. Task Force 1st Squadron, 151st Cavalry Regiment suffered one non-combat related casualty when a soldier died while working on a vehicle in the motor pool.

The Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 1st Battalion, 206th Field Artillery Regiment was assigned to function as the Garrison Command Cell at Camp Taji, Iraq. The brigade combat team deputy commander, Colonel Kirk Van Pelt accompanied the 1st Battalion, 206th Field Artillery Regiment to Taji and acted as the garrison commander. The organic units of the 1st Battalion, 206th Field Artillery Regiment were attached to various battalions in the 1st Sustainment Brigade as convoy security companies. Batteries A and B and Company G, 39th Brigade Support Battalion were tasked to escort convoys of concrete barriers to Baghdad during the Siege of Sadr City. The &quot;Clear, Hold, Build Concept&quot; as it was employed in Sadr City involved cordoning several city blocks by emplacing concrete barriers around the area to be sealed off. These barriers weighed several tons each, so an entire convoy might move only 30–40 barriers. The convoy escort team would escort the civilian trucks hauling the barriers from Camp Taji or Camp Liberty to Sadr City, and then provide security on the site for up to six hours while cranes lifted and emplaced each barrier. These missions often came under small arms fire and the threat of improvised explosive devices was constant. The 1st Battalion, 206th Field Artillery Regiment suffered no killed in action during this second deployment, although Battery B had one killed in action from an attached Regular Army unit. Sergeant Jose Ulloa, of 515th Transportation Company was killed on 8 August 2008 went the MRAP that he was riding in was struck by an improvised explosive device during a convoy security mission in Sadr City, Baghdad. Sergeant Ulloa&#x27;s platoon was attached to Battery B as a convoy security platoon at the time of his death.

The brigade combat team redeployed to Camp Shelby, Mississippi in December 2008 and demobilized. Unlike the first deployment, the soldiers of the 39th were supported by a massive reintegration effort. Soldiers and their families participated in Yellow Ribbon reintegration events at the thirty-, sixty- and ninety-day post redeployment intervals. The soldiers and their families were provided with lodging at convention centers around the state for these events. The soldiers were presented with information on Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve (ESGR), employment counseling, marriage counseling, Veterans Affairs benefits, post traumatic stress disorder and suicide prevention. Each event included a job fair to assist soldiers in finding employment.

==Composition==
==Insignia==
===Shoulder sleeve insignia===
The unit&#x27;s shoulder sleeve insignia consists of a Bowie knife over a diamond. The Bowie knife symbolizes the state of Arkansas, where the Bowie knife originated, and close hand-to-hand fighting which is the specialty of the light infantry. The diamond is a reference to a unique aspect of the state of Arkansas which has the only diamond field in North America in Murfreesboro. The red and blue colors are the colors of the state flag and represent both their loyalty (blue) and the blood (red) that its soldiers have shed for both the state of Arkansas, and the United States in its operations. The brigade motto is &quot;Courage&quot;.

The Bowie knife that adorns the shoulder sleeve insignia is worn by certain field grade officers and command sergeants major in the brigade combat team. The most famous version of the Bowie knife was designed by Jim Bowie and presented to Arkansas blacksmith James Black in the form of a carved wooden model in December 1830. Black produced the knife ordered by Bowie, and at the same time created another based on Bowie&#x27;s original design but with a sharpened edge on the curved top edge of the blade. Black offered Bowie his choice and Bowie chose the modified version. Knives like that one, with a blade shaped like that of the Bowie knife, but with a pronounced false edge, are today called &quot;Sheffield Bowie&quot; knives, because this blade shape became so popular that cutlery factories in Sheffield, England were mass-producing such knives for export to the United States by 1850, usually with a handle made from either hardwood, deer antler, or bone, and sometimes with a guard and other fittings of sterling silver.

Bowie returned, with the Black-made knife, to Texas and was involved in a knife fight with three men who had been hired to kill him. Bowie killed the three would-be assassins with his new knife and the fame of the knife grew. Legend holds that one man was almost decapitated, the second was disemboweled, and the third had his skull split open. Bowie died at the Battle of the Alamo five years later and both he and his knife became more famous. The fate of the original Bowie knife is unknown; however, a knife bearing the engraving &quot;Bowie No. 1&quot; has been acquired by the Historic Arkansas Museum from a Texas collector and has been attributed to Black through scientific analysis.

Black soon did a booming business making and selling these knives out of his shop in Washington, Arkansas. Black continued to refine his technique and improve the quality of the knife as he went. In 1839, shortly after his wife&#x27;s death, Black was nearly blinded when, while he was in bed with illness, his father-in-law and former partner broke into his home and attacked him with a club, having objected to his daughter having married Black years earlier. Black was no longer able to continue in his trade. Black&#x27;s knives were known to be exceedingly tough, yet flexible, and his technique has not been duplicated. Black kept his technique secret and did all of his work behind a leather curtain. Many claim that Black rediscovered the secret of producing true Damascus steel. In 1870, at the age of 70, Black attempted to pass on his secret to the son of the family that had cared for him in his old age, Daniel Webster Jones. However, Black had been retired for many years and found that he himself had forgotten the secret. Jones would later become Governor of Arkansas.

The birthplace of the Bowie knife is now part of the Old Washington Historic State Park which has over forty restored historical buildings and other facilities including Black&#x27;s shop. The park is known as &quot;The Colonial Williamsburg of Arkansas&quot;. The American Bladesmith Society established the William F. Moran School of Bladesmithing at this site to instruct new apprentices as well as journeyman, and mastersmiths in the art of bladesmithing.

As described in the 39th Anniversary Brigade Annual, published for the brigade combat team&#x27;s 39th anniversary celebration in 2006 at the headquarters at Ricks Armory, Little Rock, Arkansas, the Bowie knife has been the individual weapon of senior leaders in the unit since the reorganization of the unit in 1967. Only knives that are procured by order of the brigade combat team commander are authorized for wear or presentation. The handle of the knife is commensurate with the leader&#x27;s rank: General officers are authorized ivory handles; colonels wear knives with stag handles; field grade officers and the aide-de-camp wear black handles; CW3s and above are authorized walnut handles; command sergeants major and sergeants major are authorized the cherry wood handle; retired master sergeants are authorized cocobolo handles.

The knife is worn on a pistol belt on the bear&#x27;s left side with the Army Combat Uniform. The Arkansas Brigade Bowie knife has been worn by members through two deployments in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom II. The knife continues to be produced in Arkansas. Until his death, each presentation-grade knife was handmade by Mr. Jimmy Lile of Russellville, Arkansas. Mr. Lile was also commissioned to make the knives made by Sylvester Stallone in the &quot;Rambo&quot; movies. The Lile family continued to make the Bowie knife for the unit for several years following Mr. Lile&#x27;s death. Today the brigade combat team&#x27;s knife is produced by Mr. Kenny Teague of Mountainburg. The general public cannot purchase one of these knives, but can purchase a different style based on the Bowie knife pattern. Each brigade Bowie knife bears the recipient&#x27;s name, social security number, rank, and military branch, as well as the maker&#x27;s name and serial number of the knife.

===Distinctive insignia===
The stars stand for France, Spain, and the U.S., nations to which the Arkansas Territory belonged. The diamond shape was suggested by the state flag, while the wavy bar symbolizes the Arkansas River with the arrow referring to the Arkansa people. The green background alludes to the wooded hills of the Ouachita and Ozarks. The arrow in flight is used as a symbol of The Arkansas Brigade defending the state.

<text>The Bouyei (also spelled &quot;Puyi&quot;, &quot;Buyei&quot; and &quot;Buyi&quot;; , or &quot;Puzhong&quot;, &quot;Burao&quot;, &quot;Puman&quot;; ; ), otherwise known as the Zhongjia, are an ethnic group living in Southern Mainland China. Numbering 3.5 million, they are the 10th largest of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

The Bouyei primarily live in the Qianxinan and Qiannan prefectures of southern Guizhou Province, as well as in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

Some 3,000 Bouyei also live in Northern Vietnam, where they are one of that nation&#x27;s 54 officially recognized ethnic groups. In Vietnam, they are located in Mường Khương District of Lào Cai and Quản Bạ District of Hà Giang Province.

==Names==
The Bouyei consist of various subgroups. Below are their autonyms written in the International Phonetic Alphabet with numerical Chao tones.
*&quot;,

Some clans within the Bouyei groups include:

In Congjiang County, Guizhou, there is a group that refer to themselves as &quot;Buyeyi, 布也益&quot;, but are officially classified by the Chinese government as ethnic Zhuang.

==Language==

The Bouyei speak the Bouyei language, which is very close to Standard Zhuang. There is a dialect continuum between these two. The Bouyei language has its own written form, created by linguists in the 1950s based on the Latin alphabet and with spelling conventions similar to the Pinyin system that had been devised to romanise Mandarin Chinese.

==History==
The Bouyei are the native Tai peoples of the plains of Guizhou. They are one of the oldest peoples of China, living in the area for more than 2,000 years. Prior to the establishment of the Tang dynasty, the Bouyei and Zhuang were linked together; the differences between both ethnic groups grew greater and from year 900 already they were two different groups. The Qing dynasty abolished the system of local heads and commanded in its place to officials of the army which caused a change in the local economy; from then on, the land was in the hands of a few landowners, which caused the population to revolt. During the Nanlong Rebellion(南笼起义) of 1797 led by Wang Nangxian, the Bouyei underwent a strong repression that caused many of them to emigrate to faraway Vietnam.

==Culture==
Many Bouyei are agricultural farmers who commonly cultivate crops for consumption or sale like rice, millet, wheat, potatoes, maize, cocoa, tea, silk and many other types of crops. The Bouyei have also played a major role as intermediate merchants in the region. Due to changing economies, the Bouyei engage in both small-scale and large-scale commercial or business operations.

Traditional Bouyei handicrafts and batiks are renowned throughout the region. The Bouyei celebrate many festivals, both native and those derived from Han culture. One native festival is called the Ox King&#x27;s Day(牛王节) on April 8, an annual celebration meant to honor oxen and their contribution to agricultural activities.
June 6 is an important traditional Buyei holiday for ancestral worship. The story behind this tradition exists. According to Bouyei mythology, after Pangu became an expert in rice farming after creating the world, he married the daughter of the Dragon King, and their union gave rise to the Buyei people.

The daughter of the Dragon King and Pangu had a son named Xinheng (). When Xinheng disrespected his mother, she returned to heaven and never came down, despite the repeated pleas of her husband and son. Pangu was forced to remarry and eventually died on the sixth day of the sixth month of the lunar calendar.

Xinheng&#x27;s stepmother treated him badly and almost killed him. When Xinheng threatened to destroy her rice harvest, she realized her mistake. She made peace with him and they went on to pay their respects to Pangu annually on the sixth day of the sixth month of the lunar calendar.

There are Christian churches among the Bouyei ethnic group in China. Most of them are in Guizhou and Yunnan. There is Catholic influence.

==Notable Bouyei people==

*Guo Jian (郭健), artist
*Huang Xiaoyun (黃霄雲), singer and actress
*Wang Nangxian, leader of the anti-Manchu White Lotus Rebellion

<doc id="330799" wikidata="Q216096" url="?curid=330799" title="Kam people">
<text>The Kam people (Kam: , ), officially known in China as Dong people (), are a Kam–Sui people and one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by the People&#x27;s Republic of China. They live mostly in eastern Guizhou, western Hunan and northern Guangxi. Small pockets of Kam speakers are found in Tuyên Quang Province in Vietnam.

They are famed for their native-bred Kam Sweet Rice (), carpentry skills and unique architecture, in particular a form of covered bridge known as the &quot;wind and rain bridge&quot; (). The Kam people call themselves &quot;Kam&quot;, &quot;Geml&quot;, &quot;Jeml&quot; or &quot;Gaeml&quot;.

==History==
The Kam are thought to be the modern-day descendants of the ancient Rau peoples who occupied much of southern China. Kam legends generally maintain that the ancestors of the Kam migrated from the east. According to the migration legends of the Southern Kam people, their ancestors came from Guangzhou, Guangdong and Wuzhou, Guangxi. The Northern Kam maintain that their ancestors fled Zhejiang and Fujian because of locust swarms. Some scholars (mainly Chinese) also believe that the Kam were a branch of the Bai Yue from the first century CE. The Bai Yue inhabited the Yangze River basin after the collapse of the Yue Kingdom around the first century CE which led to the establishment of many small chiefdoms.

The first explicit mention of the Kam (or Dong) people come from Ming dynasty sources. Many Kam rebellions took place during the Ming and Qing dynasties, but none were successful in the long run. The Qing developed extensive irrigation systems in the area and rice harvests increased significantly but this mostly benefited the local landlords. The Kam were further exploited after the first Opium War of 1840–1842 by Western forces, capitalists, landlords, usurers and Qing officials.

As a consequence of these events, many Kam helped or joined the Chinese Communists soon after its founding in 1921. They supplied food and resources to the Red Army as it passed through Guangxi during the Long March. Some Kam also allied with the People&#x27;s Liberation Army through establishing guerilla units against the forces of Chiang Kai-Shek. After 1949, infrastructure was quickly developed in Kam areas. Schools, roads, small factories and more were built. Many Kam also became government officials.

Although the Kam and Han Chinese peoples generally get along well today, the history of Guizhou is marked by innumerable tensions and conflicts between the Han Chinese and non-Han minority groups. Today, many Kam are assimilating into mainstream Chinese society as rural Kam move into urban areas, resulting in intermarriage with the Han Chinese and the loss of the Kam language. However, various attempts to preserve Kam culture and language have been very successful, and improving living conditions in rural Guizhou may entice local Kam villagers to stay rather than move to major urban areas.

The Kam language (autonym: ) is a Tai–Kadai (Chinese: &quot;Zhuang–Dong&quot;) language. &quot;Ethnologue&quot; distinguishes three Kam varieties as separate but closely related languages: Northern Dong [doc], Southern Dong [kmc], and Cao Miao [cov]. Sui, Maonan and Mulao are the languages most closely related to Kam. Historically, Northern Kam has been influenced by Chinese much more than has Southern Kam.

The Kam language has no traditional script of its own. The Kam people sometimes use Chinese characters to represent the sounds of Kam words. A Latin alphabet was developed in 1958, but it is not much in use due to a lack of printed material and trained teachers.

==Distribution==
;County-level distribution of the Kam

(Only includes counties or county-equivalents containing &gt;1% of county population.)
==Culture==

The Kam people are internationally renowned for their polyphonic choir singing, called &quot;Kgal Laox&quot; in the Kam language (), which can be literally translated as &quot;Kam Grand Choir&quot; or &quot;Grand song&quot; in English. The Kam Grand Choir has been listed by UNESCO as a world-class intangible cultural heritage since 2009. Kam choral songs include nature songs, narratives, and children&#x27;s songs.

One-part songs (as opposed to polyphonic, or many-part, songs) can be sung by one or many people. They include:
*&quot;Duo Ye&quot; songs
*Love songs – accompanied by the pipa or niutuiqin
*Drinking songs
*Bride&#x27;s songs
*Mourning songs
*Pipa songs

Operas are highly popular among the Kam and are performed by local troupes. Two famous Kam playwrights are Wu Wencai (1798–1845), author of &quot;Mei Liangyu&quot;, and Zhang Honggan (1779–1839).

Kam oral literature contains a rich array of legends and folk tales. Many of these popular tales are about the leaders of past uprisings (Geary 2003:218). Celebrated leaders include:
*Xing Ni – An ancient figure, whose legend dates possibly from the Tang dynasty (618–907). 
*Wu Mian – Leader of a 1378 rebellion during the Ming dynasty due to drought and famine.
*Lin Kuan – Led a 1397 rebellion but was later executed. Popular among the Northern Kam and is commemorated by an ancient tree.
*Wu Jinyin – Wu revolted in the 1740 to resist grain taxes, but was killed in 1741.

Popular folk tales are listed below. They can be found in &quot;The Kam People of China&quot; by D. Norman Geary.
*The two orphan brothers
*The unfriendly eldest brother
*Ding Lang and the dragon princess
*Zhu Lang and Niang Mei
*Shan Lang and E Mei
*Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai
*Suo Lao
*Mei Dao
*The frog and the swallow (rice agriculture tale)
*The dog (rice agriculture tale)
*The singing tree (origin of singing tale)
*Liang Niangni (origin of singing tale)
*Lou Niang (drum tower tale)

==Society==
Kam clans are known as &quot;dou&quot; and are further divided into &quot;ji&quot;, &quot;gong&quot;, and households (known as &quot;kitchens&quot;), respectively from largest to smallest in size. Village elders were traditionally the village leaders, although the government replaced these elders with village heads from 1911 to 1949. Kam society was also traditionally matriarchal, as can be evidenced by the cult of the goddess Sa Sui (Geary 2003:88). Before the advent of the Han Chinese, the Kam had no surnames, instead distinguishing each other by their fathers&#x27; names.

Kam common law is known as &quot;kuan&quot; and is practiced at four levels.
#Single village
#Several villages
#Single township / entire local rural area
#Multiple townships / large portion of the Kam population

===Courtship and marriage===
Traditional courtship consists of three phases:
#Early meeting phase where men and women sing songs and recite poems to one another.
#Deepening love phase where the courtship is one-to-one and the songs are more spontaneous.
#Exchanging a token phase where a man gives a woman a gift, with the woman expected to make excuses to test her suitor. The token is usually a minor gift without much monetary value. However, it is highly important symbolically, as it is the equivalent of an engagement ring in Western cultures.

Weddings last three days and are first held at the bride&#x27;s family&#x27;s home. The bride is later sent to the groom&#x27;s home, where an afternoon reception and all-night feast then ensue. The next day there is a &quot;blocking the horse&quot; ceremony where the hosts block the guests while singing songs. The bride typically resides at her parents&#x27; house for a few months or even years. Silver jewellery is passed onto the bride by her mother.

===Birth===
The birth of a child is complemented by the following events:
#The &quot;stepping-over-the-threshold person,&quot; the first person to enter the home where the child was born, will influence the child&#x27;s future personality and success.
#Several fir trees are planted at the birth which are gifted at age 18 for marriage and new home. 
#Neighbors are invited and bring food and gifts.
#Announcing the birth to the mother&#x27;s family.
#Visit from the female relatives on the third day or so; gifts are brought.
#Homage expressed to the land god for the birth of a male child (practiced by the Northern Kam).
#Building a &quot;bridge&quot; – Three wooden planks are lined up side by side to express goodwill to passing people.
#Wrapping the hands – The child&#x27;s hands are wrapped to help prevent him or her from stealing things later on in life.
#First haircut at the age of one month.
#First eating of fermented rice at the age of about one month.
#First eating of meat dipped in wine at six months old – considered a major milestone.

===Funerals===
Like those of the Miao people, Kam funerals are highly elaborate. People who died from unnatural causes (e.g., accidents) are cremated, while those who died from natural causes are buried. Burial consists of the following phases:
#Receiving the breath – listening for last words and the person&#x27;s the last breath.
#Drinking clear tea – Three spoonfuls of &quot;clear tea&quot; and a small pieces of silver are placed into the recently deceased person&#x27;s mouth.
#Buying water for washing the corpse.
#&quot;Washing&quot; the corpse – The corpse is covered with wet money paper.
#Putting on the graveclothes – Old clothes are taken off.
#Arranging the &quot;dream bed&quot; – The suona is played during the vigil.
#Starting on the road – A red cock is killed, and the corpse is removed from the dream bed and placed into a coffin. White headcloths are worn by the mourners (also practiced by the Han Chinese).
#Digging the &quot;well&quot; (grave).
#Holding the memorial ceremony – Presents are distributed.
#Going up the mountain – Coffins are usually placed high up on a mountainside.
#Placing the coffin into the &quot;well&quot; – A chicken is killed and prayers are said. The chicken is then lowered into the grave and pulled back out again for later consumption.
#Holding the funeral receptions – Lunch and dinner are held.
#Returning to the mountain – The sons return to the grave to build a grave-mound. The dead person is called to &quot;go back home&quot; to live at the altar to the family&#x27;s ancestors.
#&quot;Transferring the sons&quot; (if the dead is female) – This is a ceremony in which the duties of filial piety are transferred from the deceased mother to her eldest brother or the eldest brother&#x27;s representative.

==Environment==
An average-size Kam village has 200–300 homes, although the smallest ones have only 10–20 and the largest ones have more than 1,000. Kam villages typically have:

*&quot;Ganlan&quot;-style wooden houses (stilt houses)
*Ancient and sacred trees
*Covered (&quot;wind-and-rain&quot;) bridges
*Wayside pavilions with wooden or stone benches
*Bullfighting arenas, which are fields
*Wells surrounded by stone rims and usually dug near trees
*Fish-ponds, traditionally communally owned
*Racks for drying grain and granaries
*Village entrances – to protect against intruders, and also are where &quot;blocking the way&quot; ceremonies are held
*Drum towers – usually found only in southern Kam areas today. Drum towers may be village towers or extended-family towers (Geary 2003:47).
*Altars to Sa Sui, the main deity of the Kam pantheon

Popular scenic spots in Kam-speaking territories are the Jiudong region, Liudong region, Chengyang village, Pingdeng region, and Yuping region.

==Agriculture and economy==
The Kam people cultivate dozens of varieties of glutinous rice (known locally as &quot;Kam&quot; or &quot;good&quot; rice). The Han Chinese cultivate non-glutinous rice, which is called &quot;Han (Chinese) rice&quot; by the Kam. Supplementary foods inclusive maize, millet, vegetables, plums, peaches, pears, mushrooms, mandarin oranges, pomelos, and watermelons. Cotton is cultivated for textile production. Generally the Kam occupy lower-lying land than the Miao and are thus wealthier.

Animals frequently raised by the Kam people include:

*Water buffalo: 1–3 per household
*Pigs: 1–3 per household
*Chickens: 2–20 per household. Hens raised by the Kam generally lay around 100 eggs per year.
*Ducks: 2–4 per household (about half of all households). Ducks tend to destroy rice seedlings and are thus less preferable than chickens.
*Geese: 2–4 per household (about one-tenth of all households). They are recent introductions from the Han Chinese.
*Fish: raised in fish-ponds and sometimes hunted

The &quot;four pillars&quot; of Kam cuisine are glutinous rice, sour (pickled) food, hot pepper, and rice wine. Other popular local dishes and condiments include barbecued fish, intestines sauce, purple blood pork, chicken-blood sauce, oil tea, &quot;gongguo&quot; (glutinous rice snack sweetened with liana) and &quot;bianmi&quot; (another glutinous rice snack). The giant salamander is a rare local specialty. Two hot meals (breakfast and dinner) and one cold meal (lunch) are served every day.

The Kam-speaking area is famous for its fir wood. Fir from the Kam area was used to build the ships of 15th-century explorer Zheng He and the Great Hall of the People. Major economic activities include carpentry and the manufacture of silverwork and wickerwork. Baskets and other wickerwork are usually made by men. Baskets can be made from five types of plant materials, namely glutinous rice straw, cogongrass, Guangxi grass, bamboo, and rattan.

In recent years, tourism has become a major source of income for the Kam people.

==Festivals==
Below is a list of traditional Kam festivals.

Two new year festivals:
*Kam New Year
*Chinese New Year

One-day work-related festivals, where chicken, fish, and glutinous rice are eaten.
*Sowing seeds
*Planting cotton
*Washing water buffaloes
*Eating new rice

There are four harvest festivals which last 1–3 days.
*Mid-Autumn Festival

Bullfighting is also historically popular among the Kam people.

==Religion==
The Kam people are traditionally polytheistic with many elements of animism. Totems include turtles, snakes, and dragons, and worshiped ancestors include the mythical figures of Song Sang, Song En, Zhang Liang, and Zhang Mei. However, the Kam have been influenced by Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism through historical contacts with the Han. This influence is mainly seen in regards to ancestor worship, funeral rites, and certain festivals like the Spring and Dragon Boat Festivals. The Kam also use rice grains, bamboo roots, snails, and chicken bone, eyes, blood, and eggs for divination. Today, Taoism, Buddhism, and to a lesser extent Christianity are practiced by the Kam.

===Spirits and deities===
Some deities and sacred natural phenomena are also listed below.

*Sa Ma Qing Sui, or Sa Sui, is the most important deity in Kam mythology. Sa Sui is a female deity who may have originally been a land goddess.
*Village entrance goddess
*Bridge goddess
*Land gods and goddesses
*Three family prosperity gods
*A love deity actually consisting of five male gods
*Banishing-evil god
*Spirit of the sky and earth
*Sun and moon worship (derived from Chinese religion)
*Thunder and lightning
*Mountains
*Rivers and streams
*Wells
*Two fire spirits: one good and one evil
*Large stones and boulders
*&quot;Wind-and-water trees&quot; (i.e., trees with magic qualities) and ancient evergreen trees
*Water buffalo spirits
*Rice seedling spirits
*Fruit tree spirits

Snakes are highly revered and are often thought to have been the progenitors of the ancient Baiyue peoples, which included the Kam. The legendary founders of the Kam people, Zhang Liang and Zhang Mei, are often called upon to help with illnesses and disasters.

===Taboos and superstitions===
Traditional Kam religion uses many taboos, omens, and fetishes. The fetishes are usually plant parts such as tree branches, reeds, leaves, and roots. Some of the taboos and superstitions are listed below.

*Not marrying in the Chinese Year of the Tiger, since they must wait around nine years before giving birth to their first infants.
*Pregnant women cannot participate in marriage ceremonies or arrangements, visit sick acquaintances, or sacrifice to gods.
*Women cannot give birth in their mothers&#x27; home. There are many other childbirth-related taboos and superstitions.
*Children cannot have haircuts before the age of one month old. The locks of hair from the first haircut must be stored and not be disposed of.
*Coffins cannot have any metal objects inside them, since departed souls fear metal objects, especially copper.
*Corpses should not be placed inside coffins during rainy weather. 
*Names are not to be called out when a corpse is being carried to its grave.
*Chopsticks should not be tapped on bowls, as this is reminiscent of beggars&#x27; behavior.
*The meat of crows or dead wild animals with unknown causes of death bring bad luck and should not be eaten.
*Unmarried men should not eat pig feet, since pigs have split hooves.
*New houses should not be built if a neighbor has recently died.
*Pregnant women should not watch new houses being built.
*Wood struck by lightning cannot be used for building houses.
*Main entrances of two houses should not directly face each other as this will cause severe quarreling.
*It is best to move into new houses at night when the village is already asleep.
*Nothing should be bought on the first day of the Chinese New Year, as this might cause materials to diminish for the new year. On this day, floors should not be swept, rubbish should not be thrown out, friends should not be visited, arguments should be avoided, and knives should not be used to cut food.
*The lusheng should not be played between the sowing and transplanting of rice seedlings, since it could attract plagues of insects.
*Meeting a pregnant woman while hunting is considered bad luck.
*While hunting, the names of animals should not be shouted so that the mountain god is not aroused to protect them.
*Fish swimming upstream are protected by the gods, and catching one will result in bad luck.
*Leaving home on the 7th, 17th, or 27th day of the month is unlucky. (This custom is also practiced by the Chinese.)
*A recently deceased person will rise up if a cat jumps over them. Therefore, all domesticated animals must be kept away from them.

===Magic and shamanism===
Rituals involving supernatural elements include dragon dances, spring buffalo dances, and fire prevention ceremonies where ash is placed in boats and sent downstream.

Sorcery can be performed in private. There are many purposes of sorcery, such as repelling evil spirits, recovering the soul of a disturbed child, exacting revenge on enemies, and inducing love. Voodoo dolls, borrowed from the Chinese, are made so that pins can be stuck onto them, with the person&#x27;s name and birth date written on them. The doll is then buried underground after being inserted into a clay pot. White cocks can be used for revenge sorcery.

Shamanism is practiced by the Kam and bears many parallels with Miao (Hmong) shamanism. One major duty of shamans is to recover the souls of sick people.

<doc id="330807" wikidata="Q628479" url="?curid=330807" title="Terry Nation">
<text>Terence Joseph Nation (8 August 19309 March 1997) was a Welsh screenwriter and novelist. Especially known for his work in British television science fiction, he created the Daleks and Davros for &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, as well as the series &quot;Survivors&quot; and &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;.

Nation first made his name as a comedy writer before becoming a prolific writer for drama, working on many of the most popular British series of the 1960s and 1970s, such as &quot;The Avengers&quot;, &quot;The Baron&quot;, &quot;The Champions&quot;, &quot;Department S&quot;, &quot;The Persuaders!&quot; and &quot;The Saint&quot;. When Nation was commissioned to write &quot;The Daleks&quot; (1963) for &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, the villainous eponymous creatures established the series&#x27; early popularity. He later devised the recurring character of Davros in &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot; (1975). His series &quot;Survivors&quot; and &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; have been described as &quot;much-loved cult TV classics&quot;.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Born in Llandaff, Cardiff, Wales, Nation initially worked in comedy, entering the industry in 1955 after a (possibly apocryphal) incident in which Spike Milligan bought a sketch that he had written because he thought that Nation appeared hungry. 

During the 1950s, Nation worked with John Junkin and Johnny Speight for the writers&#x27; agency Associated London Scripts, where he collaborated on hundreds of radio plays for comedians such as Terry Scott, Eric Sykes, Harry Worth and Frankie Howerd.

His career break came in 1962, when he was commissioned to write material for Tony Hancockfirst for Hancock&#x27;s unsuccessful series for Associated Television broadcast on ITV in 1963, and then his stage show. Although Nation accompanied Hancock as his chief screenwriter on tour in 1963, Hancock would regularly neglect Nation&#x27;s scripts in favour of recycling his old material. Following an argument over this, Hancock either sacked Nation, or Nation resigned (it is unclear which).

===&quot;Doctor Who&quot;===
Prior to his association with Hancock, Nation had declined an offer from scriptwriter David Whitaker to write for a new science-fiction programme that was entering production at the BBC; Whitaker had been impressed by a script that Nation had written for the ABC anthology series &quot;Out of this World&quot;. Now unemployed, and with a young family to support, Nation contacted Whitaker and accepted the offer, writing the second &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial, &quot;The Daleks&quot; (also known as &quot;The Mutants&quot; and &quot;The Dead Planet&quot;). The serial introduced the eponymous extraterrestrial villains that would quickly become the series&#x27; most popular and enduring monsters, and resulted in a major merchandising success for Nation and the BBC.

Nation contributed further scripts to &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. In 1965, he and Dennis Spooner co-wrote the 12-part serial &quot;The Daleks&#x27; Master Plan&quot;, after which Nation, who still held the copyright to the Daleks, attempted to launch a Dalek spin-off TV series in the United States. Various other Dalek tie-in material appeared, including comic strips in the children&#x27;s weekly &quot;TV Century 21&quot; and annuals; such material was frequently credited to Nation, even when written by others. Over the next few years, appearances by the Daleks in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; became less frequent and were written by other authors (Whitaker wrote &quot;The Power of the Daleks&quot; (1966) and &quot;The Evil of the Daleks&quot; (1967), and Louis Marks wrote &quot;Day of the Daleks&quot; (1972)).

In 1973, following an eight-year absence from the series, Nation returned to writing for the Daleks on &quot;Doctor Who&quot; with the Third Doctor serial &quot;Planet of the Daleks&quot;. In 1998, readers of &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; voted Nation&#x27;s 1975 serial &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot; the greatest &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story of all time. In the story, Nation introduced the character of Davros, the creator of the Daleks, who went on to appear in further storylines. Nation also wrote two non-Dalek scripts for &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;The Keys of Marinus&quot; in 1964, which introduced the Voord, and &quot;The Android Invasion&quot; in 1975, which introduced the Kraals. Nation&#x27;s final script for &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was &quot;Destiny of the Daleks&quot;, broadcast in 1979.

His work on &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was the subject of the documentary &quot;Terror Nation&quot;, a special feature on the BBC DVD release of &quot;Destiny of the Daleks&quot;.

===&quot;Out of the Unknown&quot;===
Nation&#x27;s first work on the science-fiction anthology series &quot;Out of the Unknown&quot; was scripting an adaptation of Ray Bradbury&#x27;s short story &quot;The Fox and the Forest&quot; in 1965 for the show&#x27;s debut series. It was about a 21st-century couple taking a forbidden trip to Mexico in 1938, only to be followed by enforcers from the future. It is one of only two episodes from the first series to be considered lost, with only two photographs and the end titles known to exist.

In 1969, when the show began to be produced in colour, Nation granted permission for the Daleks to be used in the series three episode &quot;Get Off My Cloud&quot;, based on the story by Peter Phillips about a bed-bound science-fiction author who finds himself within one of his own fantasies after a mental breakdown. This would be the first time the Daleks had been shown in colour on television, although they had previously appeared in colour in the Peter Cushing films. Only production stills and low-quality audio extracts survive.

===&quot;Survivors&quot; and &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;===
Having returned to writing for &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, the BBC commissioned Nation to create a new science-fiction drama series. First broadcast in 1975, &quot;Survivors&quot; is the post-apocalyptic story of the last humans on Earth after the world&#x27;s population has been devastated by plague. Although the series was well received, Nation&#x27;s creative vision conflicted with that of producer Terence Dudley, and the final two series were produced without Nation&#x27;s involvement.

Meanwhile, screenwriter Brian Clemens claimed that he had related the concept for &quot;Survivors&quot; to Nation in the late 1960s while they were working together on the final series of &quot;The Avengers&quot;, with Clemens claiming to have registered the &quot;Survivors&quot; concept with the Writers&#x27; Guild of Great Britain in 1965; Nation denied the allegations. Although the case was ultimately brought before the High Court, both sides withdrew from the proceedings after their legal costs mounted.

The production of Nation&#x27;s next BBC creation, &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;, experienced fewer problems. This series follows a group of criminals and political prisoners who are on the run from the evil &quot;Terran Federation&quot;, piloting a stolen spaceship of unknown origin. &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; ran for four series from 1978 to 1981. Although Nation scripted the whole of the first series of &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;, his creative influence subsequently declined in the following two series despite writing some key episodes, as script editor Chris Boucher exerted a greater influence on those seasons. Nation didn&#x27;t write any episodes in the fourth series of &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;. In the 1980s, Nation attempted, without success, to secure funding for a fifth series of &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;.

During the 1970s, Nation wrote a children&#x27;s novel for his daughter Rebecca (after whom he named the character of Rebec in the 1973 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;Planet of the Daleks&quot;) titled &quot;Rebecca&#x27;s World: Journey to the Forbidden Planet&quot;, as well as a novel based on &quot;Survivors&quot;.

===United States===
In 1980, Nation moved to Los Angeles, where he developed programme ideas and worked for various production studios. Little of his work from this time was as successful as that of his earlier period in Britain. He wrote scripts for the hit TV series &quot;MacGyver&quot; (1985) and &quot;A Fine Romance&quot; (1989).

==Death==
Nation died from emphysema in Los Angeles on 9 March 1997, aged 66. Shortly before his death, he had been collaborating with actor Paul Darrow on another attempt to revive &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;.

==Writing credits==
==Awards and nominations==
In 2013, Nation was commemorated with a blue plaque at the house in Cardiff where he was born.

<doc id="330808" wikidata="Q858076" url="?curid=330808" title="Kai Province">
<text>was a province of Japan in the area of Japan that is today Yamanashi Prefecture. Kai bordered on Sagami, Suruga, Shinano and Musashi Provinces. Its abbreviated form name was . The origin of its name is uncertain. It lies in central Honshū, west of Tokyo, in a landlocked mountainous region that includes Mount Fuji along its border with modern Shizuoka Prefecture.
==History==
Kai was one of the original provinces of Japan established in the Nara period under the Taihō Code. The original capital of the province was located in what is now Fuefuki. Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Kai was ranked as a &quot;superior country&quot; (上国) in terms of importance, and one of the 16 &quot;middle countries&quot; (中国) in terms of distance from the capital. Although not directly on the Tōkaidō, it was also included as one of the Tōkaidō provinces.

Numerous remains from the Kofun period have been found in Kai. During the Heian period, the area came under the control of the Kai Genji, who controlled the province throughout the Kamakura period. During the Sengoku period, a branch of the clan, the Takeda clan rose to prominence. The warlord Takeda Shingen, ruled Kai from his stronghold at Kōfu and expanded the holdings of the clan to include Shinano and Suruga Provinces, and engaged in constant warfare against the Uesugi clan in Echigo Province. After the Takeda were defeated by a coalition led by Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu, Kai Province came briefly under the rule of Nobunaga’s retainer Kawajiri Hidetaka. After Nobunaga’s assassination at the Honnō-ji Incident, the province was contested between Tokugawa Ieyasu and the Go-Hōjō clan based in Odawara. The Tokugawa clan, the Uesugi clan and the Hōjō clan each aspired to seize the vast area in Shinano Province, Ueno region, and Kai Province, which ruled by the remnants of the many small clans formerly serving Takeda clan, following of disorder post death of Nobunaga, at the same time with Ieyasu departure an army of 8,000 soldiers to those disputed region. This caused the triangle conflict between those three factions in the event which dubbed by historians as Tenshō-Jingo War broke out. As the war turned in favor of Tokugawa clan, combined with the defection of Sanada Masayuki to the Tokugawa faction, the Hōjō clan now negotiate truce with Ieyasu. The Hōjō clan then sent Hōjō Ujinobu as representative, while the Tokugawa sent Ii Naomasa as representative for the pre eliminary meetings. Furthermore, in October, representatives from the Oda clan such as Oda Nobukatsu, Oda Nobutaka, and Toyotomi mediated the negotiation until the truce officially concluded.

However, after the destruction of the Go-Hōjō by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1590, the province was ruled by a succession of Toyotomi loyalists.

With the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate, Kai was regarded as strategically important to the defense of Edo due to its position between the Tōkaidō and Nakasendō highways, which were connected through Kai Province by the Kōshū Kaidō. Kai Province was entrusted briefly to Tokugawa clan members or the highly trusted Yanagisawa clan from 1705-1724 as Kōfu Domain, but for the most part was retained as &quot;tenryō&quot; territory ruled directly by the shogunate through a succession of &quot;hatamoto&quot;-class &quot;daikan.&quot;

After the Meiji Restoration, Kai province was renamed Kōfu Prefecture in 1869. With the abolition of the han system in 1871, it was renamed Yamanashi Prefecture.

==Historical districts==
Kai Province consisted of nine districts (originally consisted of traditionally four):

* Yamanashi Prefecture

<doc id="330809" wikidata="Q476550" url="?curid=330809" title="Hani people">
<text>The Hani or Ho people (Hani: &quot;Haqniq&quot;; ; / 𠊛何贰) are a Lolo-speaking ethnic group in Southern China and Northern Laos and Vietnam. They form one of the 56 officially recognized nationalities of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and one of the 54 officially recognized ethnic groups of Vietnam. In Laos, the Hani are more commonly known as &quot;Ho&quot;.

==Distribution==
There are 12,500 Hani living in Lai Châu Province and Lào Cai Province of Vietnam. The Ho reside in the mountainous northern regions of Phongsaly Province in Laos, near the Chinese and Vietnamese borders.

===China===
Over ninety percent of present-day Hani peoples live in the Province of Yunnan in Southern China, located across the Ailao Mountains, between the Mekong River and the Red River (&quot;Yuanjiang&quot; river).

Subdivisions of Hani autonomous counties within prefecture-level cities and a prefecture, within Yunnan are:
*Mojiang Hani Autonomous County – Pu&#x27;er City (prefecture-level city)
*Jiangcheng Hani and Yi Autonomous County – Pu&#x27;er City
*Ning&#x27;er Hani and Yi Autonomous County – Pu&#x27;er City
*Yuanjiang Hani, Yi and Dai Autonomous County – Yuxi (prefecture-level city)
*Zhenyuan Yi, Hani and Lahu Autonomous County – Pu&#x27;er City
*Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture

==Origins==
The origins of the Hani are not precisely known, though their ancestors, the ancient Qiang tribe, are believed to have migrated southward from the Qinghai–Tibetan plateau prior to the third century CE.

The Hani oral traditions state that they are descended from the Yi people, and that they split off as a separate tribe fifty generations ago. One of their oral traditions is the recital of the names of Hani ancestors from the first Hani family down to oneself.

==Culture==

Hani houses are usually two or three stories high, built with bamboo, mud, stone and wood.

The traditional clothing of the Hani is made with dark blue fabric. The men dress in short jackets and in long wide pants. They also wear white or black turbans. The women dress depending on which clan they belong to. There is no gender difference in the clothing of children under the age of seven.

Hani are known for their vocal polyphonic singing. Eight-part polyphony was recorded in the 1990s. Their traditional musical instruments include an end-blown flute called &quot;labi&quot; (俄比) and a 3-stringed plucked lute called &quot;lahe&quot;.

Terraced fields are a feature of their agricultural practices.

=== Religion ===
The Hani are polytheists and they profess a special adoration toward the spirits of their ancestors. They are used to practicing rituals to venerate the different gods and thus to obtain their protection.

The religious hierarchy of the Hani is divided into three main personages: the &quot;zuima&quot; that directs the main celebrations; the &quot;beima&quot;, responsible for practicing the exorcisms and the magical rituals; the &quot;nima&quot; that takes charge of carrying out predictions and to administer the medicinal herbs. This last charge can be performed indistinctly by men and women.

Some Hani also practice Theravada Buddhism.

===Language===

The Hani language spoken by many of the Hani belongs to the Lolo-Burmese branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family. Many Hani speak languages related to Lolo-Burmese languages. Oral tradition tells of an ancient written script, tradition says it was lost on the migration from Sichuan. They now use a romanization of the Luchun dialect as a written script.

=== Agricultural practices ===
The Hani people have made contributions to the biodiversity of agroecosystems and mountain landscapes through their extensive traditional knowledge and maintenance of culture. One of the Hani people&#x27;s most known cultural practices are their cultivated terraced rice paddy. This has been a traditional practice for over 1300 years, creating a unique agroecosystem attracting both tourists and researchers. The terraces are recognized as a UNESCO Heritage Site and are often cited as an example of traditional farming methods.

The Hani began their rice cultivation in terraced hillside fields about 1,300 years ago, when they started to form a sustainable agroecosystem made up of forests, villages, terraced rice paddies, and river systems. The Hani people&#x27;s rice seed bank now consists of numerous traditional rice seed varieties adapted to the cold and dry conditions of mountainous regions. In 1984, Yunnan Province, Republic of China reported &quot;5285 rice varieties with Yuanyang County alone reporting 196 traditional varieties&quot;. This is due to their innovative agricultural practices, such as integrated duck and fish farming, enhanced yield and stabilized agroecosystems. In addition, the use of green manure, such as compositae and crofton weeds, bolstered soil health and combated pests. Their water management skills have sustained the rice terraces for thousands of years by channeling water from forested mountains, without the need for reservoirs. Coupled with the region&#x27;s hot and humid climate, which frequently produces thick fog, the area remains moist throughout the year. This intricate farming layout, merging terraces, rivers, villages, and forests, embodies the Hani&#x27;s relationship with nature. As a result, the Honghe Hani Rice Terraces were designated a World Heritage Site in 2013, emphasizing the significance of traditional knowledge in biodiversity conservation.

Culture has been important in preserving the terraced landscape, especially in the face of urbanization. Unlike most farmers in China, who migrate to more developed regions for better wages, the Hani people prefer part-time non-farm jobs close to their homes, returning frequently for traditional events. This employment pattern of the Hani farmers, influenced by their culture, is significant in the continued maintenance of the terraces.

Challenges still exist within this ancient farming civilization. Fewer people, especially the younger generation, are able to master the traditional terraced farming techniques. In Aichun village, &quot;about 600 people are between 20 and 40 years old, roughly one-fifth of the total population, but only 40 of them know the whole procedure of growing the red rice&quot;. Therefore, to prevent the land from being abandoned, remaining villagers work the fields. Additionally, the local government and tourist businesses partner with farmers. Farmers lease their lands to businesses, ensuring organized land management and providing villagers with steady incomes from both lease payments and farming.

==Subgroups==

===China===
According to You Weiqiong (2013:159–160), Hani subgroups were classified as follows in 1954, with 11 primary branches. Respective locations (counties) are listed as well.
*Hani 哈尼
**Nuobi 糯比: in Xinping, Mojiang
**Qidi 其弟/期弟: in Honghe, Mojiang, Puer, Zhenyuan, Sipsongpanna
**Mahei 麻黑: in Puer, Jinggu, Zhenyuan

**Kabie 卡别: in Mojiang
**Duota 堕塔: in Puer, Xinping, Zhenyuan
**Sanda 三达: in Sipsongpanna. The Sanda people live in Sanda Township 三达乡 (including in Dazhai 大寨) of Jinghong City, and speak a Yi language with many Hani loanwords (You 2013:136–137). There are 2 elderly women in Dazhai 大寨 who can only remember just over 40 words in the Sanda language. The Chinese name for this group is Sanda 三达, while the Dai name is Lanqian 兰千. The Sanda claim to have migrated from Yibang 倚邦 and Yiwu 易武. Initially, they were classified by the Chinese government as ethnic Yi, but currently they are classified as ethnic Hani.
**Haini 海尼: in Jinggu
**Huagu 花姑: in Yuanyang
**Aka 阿卡: in Puer
*Yeni 耶尼 (exonym: Kaduo 卡多): in Mojiang, Xinping, Puer, Zhenyuan, Jingdong, Jinggu, Sipsongpanna

*Haoni 豪尼
**Budu 布都: in Mojiang, Puer, Honghe, Sipsongpanna, Zhenyuan, Jinggu, Simao, Xinping

*Luomei 罗美 (exonym: Suobi 梭比): in Xinping
*Bukong 布孔 (exonyms: Heni 合尼, Baihong 白宏): in Mojiang, Honghe, Puer, Sipsongpanna, Zhenyuan, Jingdong

===Vietnam===
The Hani of Vietnam consist of the following subgroups (Vu 2010:10–11).

* The Flowery Hani (&quot;Hà Nhì Hoa&quot;), who are found in Lai Châu Province and are further split into two subgroups.
** Hà Nhì Cồ Chồ
** Hà Nhì La Mí
* The Black Hani, who are found in Bát Xát District, Lào Cai Province

In Vietnam, communes consisting almost exclusively of ethnic Hani include Sín Thầu, Chúng Chải, Mù Cả, Ka Lăng, Thu Lủm (all in Mường Tè District), Y Tý and A Lù (all in Bát Xát District). The Hani of A Lù had originally come from Jinping County of Yunnan, China, and had later spread from A Lù to the communes of Lao Chải, Nậm Pung, and Ngài Thầu.

<text>Lance Dwight Alworth (born August 3, 1940), nicknamed &quot;Bambi&quot;, is an American former professional football wide receiver who played for the San Diego Chargers of the American Football League (AFL) and National Football League (NFL), and the Dallas Cowboys of the NFL. Often considered one of the greatest wide receivers of all time, he played for 11 seasons, from 1962 through 1972, and was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1978. He was the first player inducted whose playing career was principally in the AFL. Alworth is also a member of the College Football Hall of Fame. His teammates called him Bambi because he had a baby face and could run like a deer.

==Early life==
Born in Houston, Texas, Alworth was raised in Hog Chain, Mississippi, a small community in Lincoln County. He played football at Brookhaven High School before attending the University of Arkansas. While in high school, he earned 15 letters. Alworth&#x27;s sister Ann was fast enough in the 50- and 75-yard dashes in track to be invited to the Olympic Games trials, though she declined the invitation. After high school, Alworth was offered baseball contracts by the New York Yankees and the Pittsburgh Pirates.

==College career==
At Arkansas, the six-foot (1.83 m), Alworth was a flanker who led all colleges in punt return yardage in 1960 and 1961. He also was a track star competing in the long jump and running the 100 and 220-yard dashes (in 9.6 seconds and 21.2 seconds, respectively). Alworth was a three-time Academic All-American, graduating with a degree in marketing as a pre-law student. In 1962, Alworth was on multiple All-American teams: &quot;Look&quot; magazine, Associated Press, United Press International and Coaches. Alworth was a key member of Arkansas teams that won, or shared, three consecutive Southwest Conference championships between 1959 and 1961, winning 25 games in that time span. The 1959 team won the 1960 Gator Bowl over Georgia Tech. Alworth was the MVP of the 1961 Cotton Bowl Classic, even though Arkansas lost the game, after he returned a punt for a touchdown. It would be the last time a punt was returned for a touchdown in the Cotton Bowl for fifty-one years until another Razorback, Joe Adams, returned a punt for a score in the 2012 Cotton Bowl Classic. 
He is a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. Alworth is a member of the University of Arkansas Hall of Honor and the Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame; he was named to the University of Arkansas&#x27; 1960&#x27;s All-Decade Team, and the school&#x27;s All-Century Team in 1994.

==Professional career==

===San Diego Chargers===
Alworth was chosen in the first round (eighth overall) of the 1962 NFL draft by the San Francisco 49ers. The American Football League&#x27;s Oakland Raiders selected him with their first pick (ninth overall) in the second round of the 1962 AFL Draft, and then traded his rights to the San Diego Chargers in return for halfback Bo Roberson, quarterback Hunter Enis, and offensive tackle Gene Selawski. Alworth opted to sign with the Chargers instead of the 49ers. The Chargers kept Alworth at flanker. His slender build, speed, grace, and leaping ability earned him the nickname &quot;Bambi.&quot;

In his rookie season, Alworth had just 10 receptions in 4 games (though three were for touchdowns). His second year was a different story, as he set franchise records in receptions (61), yards (1,205), and touchdowns (11), earning the UPI&#x27;s AFL Most Valuable Player award. He had 4 receptions for 77 yards, including a 48-yard touchdown, in San Diego&#x27;s AFL championship win over the Boston Patriots. He was selected as an AFL Western Division All-Star for the first of seven consecutive seasons, as well as an AFL All-League flanker for the first of six seasons, selected by his peers from 1963 to 1966, and by newspaper wire services from 1967 to 1968.

Over the next six seasons (1964–1969), Alworth broke his own franchise receiving records several times, and also led the league in receptions, receiving yards, receiving touchdowns, and total touchdowns three times each. He shattered the record for most consecutive seasons with over 1,000 receiving yards (7, previously 3, now held by Jerry Rice with 11), and was the first player with back-to-back seasons averaging 100+ receiving yards per game, both of which led the league. The 1966 season was particularly noteworthy, because he led the league in five categories. He still shares the record for the most regular-season games with 200+ yards receiving (5), and had a franchise-record streak of 96 consecutive games with a reception.

Alworth formed a formidable tandem with Chargers quarterback John Hadl, and is considered by many to be the best wide receiver in all professional football during the 1960s. He is a member of the AFL All-Time Team. He was the first of only a few American Football League stars to be featured on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, which like other media of the 1960s, showed a distinct bias for the NFL. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; even went so far as to declare Alworth the &quot;Top Pro Receiver&quot; in December 1965, this at a time when many claimed the AFL had inferior players. Alworth&#x27;s productivity sharply declined in 1970 (35 catches for 608 yards), and he was traded to Dallas at the end of the season. See below for his numerous franchise records with the Chargers.

===Dallas Cowboys===
On May 19, 1971, Alworth was traded to the Dallas Cowboys, for his final two seasons. In exchange, the Chargers received Tony Liscio, Pettis Norman, and Ron East.

In Super Bowl VI following the 1971 season, he scored the game&#x27;s first touchdown, which was a 7-yard touchdown pass from Roger Staubach in the Cowboys&#x27; 24–3 victory over the Miami Dolphins. Alworth would later call the two receptions he made in Super Bowl VI (one that converted a third and long and the other for the touchdown) the two most important catches of his career.

==Legacy==
Alworth finished his 11 AFL/NFL seasons with 543 receptions for 10,266 yards. He also rushed for 129 yards, returned 29 punts for 309 yards, gained 216 yards on 10 kickoff returns, and scored 87 touchdowns (85 receiving and 2 rushing).

In 1972, he was inducted to the San Diego Hall of Champions. In 1977, he was inducted in the Chargers Hall of Fame. In 1978, he became the first San Diego Charger and the first player who had played in the AFL to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He chose to be presented at the Canton, Ohio ceremony by Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis, his former position coach at San Diego, who had much to do with the success of the AFL.

Alworth&#x27;s number 19 was retired by the Chargers in 2005. In 1970, he was selected as a member of the AFL All-Time Team, and in 1994, he was named to the NFL 75th Anniversary All-Time Team, the only player to be named to both teams.

In 1979, he was inducted into the Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame. In 1988, he was inducted into the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame.

In 1999, he was ranked number 31 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Football Players, making him the highest-ranking Charger and the highest-ranking player to have spent more than one season in the AFL.

In 2014, he was inducted into the Southwest Conference Hall of Fame.

<text>The Lisu people (Lisu: ; , ; ; ) are a Tibeto-Burman ethnic group who inhabit mountainous regions of Myanmar (Burma), southwest China, Thailand, and the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh.

About 730,000 Lisu live in Lijiang, Baoshan, Nujiang, Dêqên and Dehong prefectures in Yunnan Province and Sichuan Province, China. The Lisu form one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by China. In Myanmar, the Lisu are recognized as one of 135 ethnic groups and an estimated population of 600,000. Lisu live in the north of the country; Kachin State (Putao, Myitkyina, Danai, Waingmaw, Bhamo), Shan State (Momeik, Namhsan, Lashio, Hopang, and Kokang), and southern Shan State (Namsang, Loilem, Mongton), and Sagaing Division (Katha and Khamti), Mandalay Division (Mogok and Pyin Oo Lwin). Approximately 55,000 live in Thailand, where they are one of the six main hill tribes. They mainly inhabit remote mountainous areas.

The Lisu tribe consists of more than 58 different clans. Each family clan has its own name or surname. The biggest family clans well known among the tribe clans are Laemae pha, Bya pha, Thorne pha, Ngwa Pha (Ngwazah), Naw pha, Seu pha, Khaw pha. Most of the family names came from their own work as hunters in the primitive time. However, later, they adopted many Chinese family names. Their culture has traits shared with the Yi people or Nuosu (Lolo) culture.

== History ==

Lisu history is passed from one generation to the next in the form of songs. Today, these songs are so long that they can take an entire night to sing.

=== Origins ===

The Lisu are believed to have originated in eastern Tibet even before present Tibetans arrived in the plateau. Research done by Lisu scholars indicates that they moved to northwestern Yunnan. They inhabited a region across Baoshan and the Tengchong plain for thousands of years. Lisu, Yi, Lahu, and Akha are Tibetan–Burman languages, distantly related to Burmese and Tibetan. After the Han Chinese Ming Dynasty, around 1140–1644 CE the eastern and southern Lisu languages and culture were greatly influenced by the Han culture. Taiping village in Yinjiang, Yunnan, China, was first established by Lu Shi Lisu people about 1,000 years ago. In the mid-18th century, Lisu peoples in Yinjiang began moving into Momeik, Burma, a population of southern Lisu moved into Mogok, and southern Shan State, and then in the late 19th century, moved into northern Thailand. Lisu is one of the three Lolo tribes, the descendants of Yi. Yi (or Nuosu) are still much closer to the Lisu and Myanmar languages. Myat Wai Toe observes that as the saying, &quot;the Headwaters of the Great River, Lisu originates,&quot; where Lisu lived in &quot;Mou-Ku-De&quot;; they were not yet called &quot;Lisu&quot; until 400–200 BC.
=== Present===

Since the 2010s, many Lisu clashed with the Kachin over allegations of the KIA forcefully conscripting them and killing civilians. During the Myanmar Civil War, the Lisu National Development Party formed pro-Tatmadaw militias to fight the KIA and the PDF. Both the youth and the elderly were conscripted into these &quot;people&#x27;s militias.&quot; U Shwe Min led these militias until his death on March 7, 2024. 

== Lisu in India ==
Lisu people in India are called Yobin. In all government records, Lisu are Yobin, and the words are sometimes used interchangeably. In Lisu is one of the minority tribes of Arunachal Pradesh of India. They live mainly in Vijoynagar Circle at Gandhigram (or Shidi in Lisu) which is the largest village. Lisus are also found in Miao town and Injan village of Kharsang Circle Changlang District. The Lisu traditionally lived in the Yunnan Province of southwestern China and in Shan State and Kachin State of northeastern Myanmar. There are about 5,000 Lisu people in India.

=== Government discovery of Lisu ===
Initially, the Indo-Burmese border had been drawn based on surveys conducted under the Topographical Survey of British India as early as 1912, following the highest ridge from the Hkakabo Razi (alt. ; the highest point in Myanmar) at the junction with the Chinese border in the north, to the Chittagong Hills in Bangladesh according to a &quot;combination of ridges, watershed and highest crests&quot;. Later, during World War II, G.D.L. Millar&#x27;s diary recalls the escape of a party of 150 European, Indian and Kachin officials and civilians fleeing the advance of the Japanese in May 1942. They went from Putao (Kachin) to Margherita (Assam) via the Chaukan Pass, and followed the valley of the Noa-dihing river. Millar records that over a hundred miles of the Chaukan Pass, &quot;there was no trace of man&quot; either Lisu or any other tribe. The border negotiations with China that led to the 1962 Sino-Indian War, and the intrusion of Chinese troops into the Indian State of Arunachal Pradesh, propelled the Government of India to secure its international borders in the North East region, defined as per the Topographical Survey of British India. The Assam Rifles Regiments who took control of the border area hired labourers from various tribes, including Lisus, to build the air strip at Vijoynagar. In 1969–70, 200 families were settled in the area. In 2010, the population was estimated at 5500 including Gorkhali Jawan(Ex-Assam Rifles Pensioners and Lisus/Yobin).

=== Arrival via the Ledo Road ===
Some groups of Lisu arrived in India via the Ledo Road. Some of them worked as coal miners under British (One certificate that originally belonged to one Aphu Lisu is a British coal miner&#x27;s certificate from 1918, preserved by the Lisu). The certificate bears the mark of the then governor who ruled the region from Lakhimpur, Assam (the section of Ledo road between Ledo and Shingbwiyang was only opened in 1943). Most of the Lisu who lived in Assam went back to Myanmar. However, some are still found in the Kharangkhu area of Assam, Kharsang Circle of Arunachal Pradesh. While most have lost their mother tongue, some have preserved the language and culture almost intact.

=== Political and social issues ===
In the early 1980s, the Lisu people living in India did not have Indian citizenship as they were considered refugees from Myanmar. In 1994, Indian citizenship was granted to them, but not Scheduled Tribe status. This is currently the subject of a claim to the Government.

Except for the arrival of a fleet of jeeps in the late 1970s, the area has been without roads and vehicles for 4 decades. The area is isolated, hence some describing the people as &quot;prisoners of geography&quot;.

In fact, Namdapha was originally declared a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1972, then a National Park in 1983. The authorities demarcated the southern boundary near Gandhigram village. Since then the Lisus settling in the National Park are considered as &quot;encroachers&quot; as per the Wildlife Protection Act 1972. Between 1976 and 1981, a road was made between Miao and Vijoynagar (MV road) by the Public Works Department following the left bank of the Noa-dihing river through Namdapha National Park but proved difficult to maintain due to extreme rainfall and frequent landslides. It was also felt that a road would further facilitate wildlife poaching and land encroachment in the National Park. Renovation of the MV road was announced in 2010 and 2013.

== Culture ==
Lisu villages are usually built close to water to provide easy access for washing and drinking. Their homes are usually built on the ground and have dirt floors and bamboo walls, although an increasing number of the more affluent Lisu are now building houses of wood or even concrete.

Lisu subsistence was based on paddy fields, mountain rice, fruit and vegetables. However, they have typically lived in ecologically fragile regions that do not easily support subsistence. They also faced constant upheaval from both physical and social disasters (earthquakes and landslides; wars and governments). Therefore, they have typically been dependent on trade for survival. This included work as porters and caravan guards. With the introduction of the opium poppy as a cash crop in the early 19th century, many Lisu populations were able to achieve economic stability. This lasted for over 100 years, but opium production has all but disappeared in Thailand and China due to interdiction of production. Very few Lisu ever used opium, or its more common derivative heroin, except for medicinal use by the elders to alleviate the pain of arthritis.

The Lisu practiced swidden (slash-and-burn) agriculture. In conditions of low population density where land can be fallowed for many years, swiddening is an environmentally sustainable form of horticulture. Despite decades of swiddening by hill tribes such as the Lisu, northern Thailand had a higher proportion of intact forest than any other part of Thailand. However, with road building by the state, logging (some legal, but mostly illegal) by Thai companies, enclosure of land in national parks, and influx of immigrants from the lowlands, swidden fields can not be fallowed, can not re-grow, and swiddening results in large swathes of deforested mountainsides. Under these conditions, Lisu and other swiddeners have been forced to turn to new methods of agriculture to sustain themselves.

The Thai Lisu traditional costume shown here is much different from the main Lisu traditional costume being widely used in Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan, China and Putao, Danai, Myitkyina, Northern Myanmar.

== Religion ==

=== Christianity ===

Beginning in the early-20th century, many Lisu people in India and Burma converted to Christianity. Missionaries such as James O. Fraser, Allyn Cooke and Isobel Kuhn and her husband, John, of the China Inland Mission (now OMF International), were active with the Lisu of Yunnan. Among the missionaries, James Outram Fraser (1880–1938) was the first missionary to reach the Lisu people in China. Another missionary who evangelized Lisu people in Myanmar was Thara Saw Ba Thaw (1889–1968). James Fraser and Saw Ba Thaw together created the Lisu alphabet in 1914. There were many other missionaries who brought Christianity to Lisu people. David Fish says, &quot;There were over a hundred missionaries who committed their life for spreading the Gospel among the Lisu people. They came from different denominations and mission; China Inland Mission, Disciples of Christ (Church of Christ), Assembly of God, Pentecostal Churches, and so on. The Lisu people accepted those missionaries and their teaching the Gospel so that they converted into Christianity quickly to be followers of Christ.&quot;

The first missionaries in China and Myanmar were Russell Morse and his wife, Gertrude Erma Howe, who became Gertrude Morse after marriage with Russell Morse. The Missionaries of Christian Churches or Church of Christ in Myanmar were Morse families. Their mission record notes that the Morse family started their mission in China in 1926 but, due to political unrest, they traveled to Burma and began teaching among Lisu tribe in 1930.

The Lisu people&#x27;s conversion to Christianity was relatively fast. Many Lisu and Rawang converted to Christianity from animism. Before World War II, the Lisu tribes who lived in Yunnan, China, and Ah-Jhar River valley, Myanmar, were evangelized by missionaries from Tibetan Lisuland Mission and Lisuland Churches of Christ. Many Lisu then converted to Christianity.

The missionaries promoted education, agriculture, and health care. The missionaries created the Lisu written language and new opportunities. David Fish reports that, &quot;J. Russell Morse brought many kinds of fruit such as Washington, Orange, Ruby, King-Orange, and grapefruit. Fruit cultivation spread from Putao to other parts of Myanmar and become an important national asset. He also trained the people the art of carpentry and the construction of buildings. And the Lisu people had also learned the strategy of Church planting from them.&quot;

The missionaries studied Lisu culture so they could rapidly spread Christianity. They used various kind of methods, including teaching hymns, sending medicines and doctors, helping the needy, and providing the funds for domestic missionaries and evangelists. They also helped in developing Lisu agriculture.

The Chinese government&#x27;s Religious Affairs Bureau has proposed considering Christianity as the official religion of the Lisu.

, there were more than 700,000 Christian Lisu in Yunnan, and 450,000 in Myanmar (Burma). Only the Lisu of Thailand have remained unchanged by Christian influences.

=== Animism/shamanism/ancestor worship ===
Before Christianity was introduced to Lisu people, they were animists. Archibald Rose points that the religion of the Lisus appears to be a simple form of animism or nat-worship, sacrifices being offered to the spirits of the mountains. Most important rituals are performed by shamans. The main Lisu festival corresponds to Chinese New Year and is celebrated with music, feasting and drinking, as are weddings; people wear large amounts of silver jewelry and wear their best clothes at these times as a means of displaying their success in the previous agricultural year. In each traditional village there is a sacred grove at the top of the village, where the sky spirit or, in China, the Old Grandfather Spirit, are propitiated with offerings; each house has an ancestor altar at the back of the house.

== Language ==
Linguistically, Lisu belong to the Yi language or Nuosu branch of the Sino-Tibetan family.

There are two scripts in use. The Chinese Department of Minorities publishes literature in both. The oldest and most widely used one is the Fraser alphabet developed about 1920 by James O. Fraser and the ethnic Karen evangelist Ba Thaw. The second script was developed by the Chinese government and is based on pinyin.

Fraser&#x27;s script for the Lisu language was used to prepare the first published works in Lisu which were a catechism, portions of scripture, and a complete New Testament in 1936. In 1992, the Chinese government officially recognized the Fraser alphabet as the official script of the Lisu language.

Only a small portion of Lisu are able to read or write the script, with most learning to read and write their local language (Chinese, Thai, Burmese) through primary education.

<text>The Gelao people (also spelled Gelo) (Gelao: &quot;Klau&quot;, ) are an ethnic group of China and Vietnam. They form one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by the People&#x27;s Republic of China. However, many Gelao are also variously classified as Yi, Miao, and Zhuang by the Chinese government.

They number approximately 438,200 and are mainly located in Gelao autonomous counties in the western part of Guizhou, such as Wuchuan Gelao and Miao Autonomous County and Daozhen Gelao and Miao Autonomous County in Zunyi. They are also found in Liupanshui, Anshun, Dafang, and Bijie. Some live in western Guangxi (Longlin Various Nationalities Autonomous County), southeastern Yunnan and southern Sichuan. The main religion practiced is Taoism with a small but significant Buddhist minority.

==History==
The Gelao people are often considered to be the aboriginal inhabitants of Guizhou. The ancestors of the Gelao were the Rau peoples, who made up the population of ancient Yelang.

==Language==
The Gelao languages belong to the Kra–Dai language family. Today, only a small minority of the Gelao still speak this language. Since the various Gelao dialects differ greatly from each other, Mandarin has been used as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; and is now the main language spoken by Gelaos. Hmong, Nuosu, and Bouyei are also used.

==Culture==
Gelao men&#x27;s traditional suit consists of a jacket fastened up the side and long pants. Gelao women wear short jackets and narrow skirts, divided into three parts: The top section is elaborate in red wool, while the other two parts are made of black and white bordered fabric. Both men and women wear long scarves.

The Gelao make a two-stringed fiddle with a body made from a cow horn, called the &quot;jiaohu&quot; (; pinyin: jiǎohú) used in their traditional music.

The Gelao people have their own language, Gelao. At present, only a little over a thousand Gelao people can speak their traditional language. The Gelao language differs greatly from place to place due to scattered living. Most Gelao people speak several languages in the same language family, such as Mandarin, Miao, Yi, and Bouyei.

Gelao folk circulates oral literature such as poetry and proverbs. Ancient folk songs consist of long and short sentences of varying numbers of words. In the past two or three hundred years, they have been greatly influenced by the genre of Han poetry, and many have borrowed Chinese words and phrases.

===Language===
It was previously thought that the Gelao people only had a spoken language, not a written one. However, in September 2008, &quot;The History of Jiu Tian Da Ling&quot; (English: &quot;Record of the Nine Heavens&quot;) was found in Guizhou. The book is kept by a Gelao person with a surname of Li in Qianbei, whose ancestors were from the Song dynasty. A descendant of King Li Wentong of Gulao, he himself does not know what kind of book this is, but he has always inherited his ancestral teachings and treasures the book. The discovery of &quot;Record of the Nine Heavens&quot; fully proved that the Gelao people and their splendid culture have a long history, reaching back to ancient times. It not only has a written language, but it was also the earliest nation that advocated the concept of &quot;harmony and harmony&quot;. The Gelao tribe invented their own words of tea, fireworks, copper, iron, etc.

Although the book identifies the distribution area of the Gelao ethnic group described in &quot;Record of the Nine Heavens&quot; in a manner consistent with information that circulated locally during the mid-1980s (for example, it states that the origin of the Gelao is in Wuchuan, but core parts of Yelang now lying in Panjiang, Chishui, and Hebei are ignored), it deviates from local history records dating from the Ming and Qing dynasties. However, the description of the ancient song &quot;Sue Genyou&quot; in Gelao, and the classical Chinese and Gelao language written in &quot;The History of Nine Heavens&quot; contain many grammatical errors, presenting the possibility of a modern-day forgery.

The Gelao people living in the western part of Guizhou, such as Anshun, used to have Gelao characters derived from Chinese characters, which had been used to record some folk songs.

==Subgroups==
The Gelao consist of various subgroups. Their historical exonyms, given in a provincial ethnic gazetteer from the Republic of China era, include the following.

*Flowery Gelao 花仡佬, in Qianwei 前卫, Pingfa 平伐司, Yongning 永宁州, Shibing 施秉, Longquan 龙泉, Huangping 黄平
*Red Gelao 红仡佬, in Qingshan 青山司, Anping 安平县, Renhuai 仁怀县, Liping 黎平府
*Jiantou/Cut-Head Gelao 剪头仡佬, in Guiding 贵定, Shibing 施秉, Huangping 黄平, Yongning 永宁
*Tooth-Hitting Gelao 打牙仡佬, in Pingyue 平越, Qianxi 黔西, Anping 安平, Yongping 永宁, Pingyuan 平远, Huangping 黄平, Qingzhen 清镇
*Guoquan/Pot-Circle Gelao 锅圈仡佬, in Pingyuan 平远, Anping 安平, Dading 大定
*Datie/Iron-Hit Gelao 打铁仡佬, in Pingyuan 平远州
*Pipao/Robe Gelao 披袍仡佬, in Pingyuan 平远, Anping 安平, Dading 大定
*Shui/Water Gelao 水仡佬, in Yuqing 余庆, Zhenyuan 镇远, Shibing 施秉, Yongning 永宁
*Tu/Native/Indigenous Gelao 土仡佬, in Weining 威宁
*Yayi/Elegant Gelao 雅意仡佬, in Yongning 永宁

===Yi people===
The Yi (), who number no more 3,000 people, live in the Chishui (赤水) area in Xuyong County, Sichuan, which is on the border with Guizhou. They are a subgroup of the Gelao but have a distinctive history. The Yi call themselves the &quot;gau13&quot;. In comparison, the Gelao of Xinzhai 新寨, Puding 普定, Guizhou, call themselves the &quot;qau13&quot;. The Yi live in:

* Chishui village 赤水镇, Xuyong County 叙永县, Sichuan
* Napangou 纳盘沟, Gulin County 古蔺县, Sichuan. According to the &quot;Gulin County Gazetteer&quot; (1993), ethnic Gelao and Yi are found on the northern banks of the Chishui River 赤水河, in Napan township 纳盘乡.
* Xiaohe 小河, Puyi 普宜, Bijie County 毕节县, Guizhou
* Yindi 阴底, Bijie County 毕节县, Guizhou

The Yi have been mentioned since the Tang dynasty, and were said to have come from the north. The Yi are also noted for their belief in the Zitong (子童) Bodhisattva (菩萨).

Unlike most Gelao dialects, the Yi dialect uses a Loloish-derived numeral system (Zhang 1993:424).

===Gelao in Vietnam===
In Vietnam, the Gelao are recognized as an official ethnic group. There are 2,636 Gelaos in Vietnam (2009), mostly inhabited in the karst plateau Hoàng Su Phì and Đồng Văn districts of Hà Giang province. They represent a majority in Túng Sán commune of Hoàng Su Phì.

<doc id="330819" wikidata="Q750479" url="?curid=330819" title="Lahu people">
<text>The Lahu people ( Lāhùzú; Lahu: &quot;Ladhulsi&quot; / &quot;Kawzhawd&quot;; ) are an ethnic group native to China, Myanmar, and the rest of Mainland Southeast Asia. 

== Etymology ==
The Chinese name &quot;Lahu&quot; literally means &quot;to drag favour from heaven&quot; (拉, lā, &quot;to drag&quot;; 祜, hù, &quot;blessing, favour&quot;). It replaced the older and more-offensive &quot;Luohei&quot; (猓黑) as the official Chinese name for the Lahu people.

== Distribution ==
The Lahu are one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by the People&#x27;s Republic of China, where about 720,000 live in Yunnan province, mostly in Lancang Lahu Autonomous County. In Thailand, the Lahu are one of the six main groups categorized as hill tribes. The Tai often refer to them by the exonym Musoe (also spelled &quot;Muser&quot;; ), meaning &#x27;hunter&#x27;. They are one of 54 ethnic groups in Vietnam, and mostly live in three communes of Mường Tè, Lai Châu Province.A few Lahu, along with many Hmong and Mien and some Lao, were recruited by the United States Central Intelligence Agency to help fight against the communist Pathet Lao, known as the secret war, during the Laotian Civil War. In fear of retribution when the Pathet Lao took over the Laotian government in 1975, those who had helped the United States fled to neighboring Thailand seeking political asylum.

A couple thousand Lahu have resettled in the United States as refugees, in the states of California, Minnesota, North Carolina, Texas, and Utah.

==Subgroups==
The Lahu divide themselves into a number of subgroups, such as the Lahu Na (Black Lahu), Lahu Nyi (Red Lahu), Lahu Hpu (White Lahu), Lahu Shi (Yellow Lahu) and the Lahu Shehleh. Where a subgroup name refers to a color, it refers to the traditional color of their dress. These groups do not function as tribes or clans - there are no kin groups above that of the family. Lahu trace descent bilaterally, and typically practice matrilocal residence.

Bradley (1979) lists the following Lahu ethnic subgroups.

;Black Lahu

*Si Pyeng (&#x27;yellow-Pyeng&#x27;)

*Hai (Chinese &#x27;black&#x27; ?)

;Non-Lahu (some have &quot;become&quot; Lahu)
*Micha (Lisoid group)
*Bana (Akoid group)

==Language==

The Lahu language is part of the Loloish branch of the Lolo–Burmese subgroup of the Tibeto-Burman family (itself a member of the Sino-Tibetan language family). Like most of its relatives, it is a strongly isolating language with subject–object–verb word order, and a set of numeral classifiers. There are seven tones, and consonants cannot close syllables. The language spoken by the Lahu Shi is notably divergent from that spoken by the other groups. In Thailand, Lahu Na often serves as a lingua franca among the various hill tribes. Written Lahu uses the Latin alphabet. Among Christian villages, the language has been enriched by loanwords from English, Latin and Greek via Bible translation, plus neologisms in the areas of hygiene, music and education.

==Religion==
The traditional Lahu religion is polytheistic. Buddhism was introduced in the late 17th century and became widespread. Many Lahu people in China are Buddhists. Christianity became established in Burma in the 19th century and has been spreading since.

The Lahu of Northeastern Thailand had encounters with Theravada Buddhist forest monks (tudong monks) around the years 1930–1940. The leader of such a group of monks, Mun Bhuridatta, spent some time in Lahu territory. These Lahu asked him for a &quot;gatha that would protect them from ghosts and demons.&quot;

==Names==
Lahu people used to have just a given name, until the Chinese Government gave them surnames. About 90% of the Lahu people are either named Lee or Zhang, two of the most common Chinese surnames. Lahu given names are made of two syllables: one that shows the gender and one that gives information on the day of birth, based on the zodiac. For example, a person born on the Ox day will be named “Zanu” if he is a boy and “Nanu” if she is a girl.

<text>The Dongxiang (autonym: &quot;Sarta&quot; or &quot;Santa&quot;) are a Mongolic people and one of 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Half of the population live in Dongxiang Autonomous County, Linxia Prefecture, Gansu Province, China. The rest are divided over Hezheng County, Linxia City, Lanzhou, Dingxi and Ningxia. According to the 2010 census, their population numbers 621,500, although research has found that the number is inflated due to Hui identifying themselves as Dongxiang for the census, in order to benefit from minority policies.

==History==
Chinese historians generally agreed that Dongxiang are the descendants of Central Asians migrated to Mongol-ruled China. They were converted to Islam in the 1340s by a missionary named Hamzeh (哈木則, &quot;Hāmùzé&quot;). They spoke a different Central Asian language before shifting to their current mother tongue, Dongxiang language, a member of the Mongolic languages.

The name Dongxiang is derived from them living in what was called the eastern () part of Hezhou prefecture, present day Linxia.

===Origin===
Haplogroup analysis by Wen et. al. (2013) shows that the closest relative of Dongxiang people are the common ancestors of the Kyrgyz of Kyrgyzstan and Xinjiang, the Tajiks of Khujand, Tajikistan, and the Ishkashimis of Tajikistan. The second closest relative is the Salars of Xinhua, Qinghai. The third closest relative are the commons ancestors of the Uyghurs and Tajiks of Xinjiang, the Shughnis of Tajikistan, the Bartangi of Tajikistan and various Uzbeks of different Central Asian countries.

STR analysis excluding Kyrgyz, Tajiks and other Central Asians might conclude Dongxiang is close to East Asians as a whole.

Physical anthropological analysis by Li et. al. (2011) shows that the closest relative of Dongxiang men among the Chinese populations are the Tajiks in Tashkurgan, Xinjiang. The next closest relative is the common ancestor of the Mongols in Bayingolin, Xinjiang, the Salars in Xinhua, Qinghai and the Mongols in Tongliao, Inner Mongolia. The physical anthropology of Dongxiang women show her closest relative are the common ancestor of the Bonans in Jishishan, Gansu and the Oroqens in Oroqen Banner, Inner Mongolia. Her next closest relative is the common ancestors of the Monguors in Huzhu, Qinghai, the Salars in Xinhua, Qinghai and the Tajiks in Tashkurgan, Xinjiang.

Distribution of Y-chromosome haplogroups in Dongxiang:

O=24.29(O2=18.69,O1a=1.87,O1b=3.73)

J=16.82

R1=16.82(R1a=14.02,R1b=2.8)

R2=9.35

C=6.54

G=5.61

N=5.6

D=4.67

E=3.74

Others=6.56

In another study in 2010 found that the majority of the Dongxiang belonged to Haplogroup R1a (R1a : 54%).

===Intermarriage===
The Dongxiang have Mongol, Han Chinese, Hui and Tibetan surnames. Dongxiang with Han Chinese surnames such as Wang, Kang, Zhang, Gao and Huang claim descent from Han Chinese. Surnames such as Ma and Mu are of Hui origin.

Some Dongxiang have said that, in the rare instances that they do marry with other people, it is only with Han and Hui, but not Tibetans.

==Military history==
In 1900, Generals Ma Fulu and Ma Fuxiang brought a Chinese Muslim troop comprising Dongxiang, Hui and Bonan to fight the foreign troops in the Boxer Rebellion. They were killed while defending the Zhengyang Gate in Beijing. In 1937–1945, General Ma Biao brought a multiethnic troop, including Dongxiang, to fight the Second Sino-Japanese War. Some claimed Ma Fuxiang himself was of a Dongxiang assimilated into the Hui Chinese.

==Economy==
The base of the economy of Dongxiang is agriculture. The main products are potatoes, corn, barley, millet and wheat. They are also recognized craftsmen, specializing in the elaboration of traditional carpets.

==Culture==
An early ethnography of Dongxiang was documented in 1940 by the American Asiatic Association. The author interviewed Ma Chuanyuan, a Muslim Mongol who was the magistrate of five districts, on the origins of his people. The account described them as a community of one hundred thousand, Mongol by race, Islam by religion and Chinese by culture.

Common Dongxiang cuisine includes the use of a potato mash that is used for noodles, snacks, alcoholic drinks and more.

Traditional Dongxiang dress for men includes buttoned robes and a broad waistband. These waistbands are sometimes used to hang knives, snuff bottles, or small bags on them. A vest over a white shirt, trousers and a beret like cap makes up the rest of the traditional outfit. Seasonal clothing like sheepskin coats are also worn during the winter. Dongxiang women wear embroidered outfits which include wide sleeved shirts and trousers. Older women wear kerchiefs and younger women tend to wear bright decorated cotton caps and silk veils. On special occasions, women wear embroidered shoes with a medium heel.

==Language and education==
The Dongxiang speak the Dongxiang language, a member of the Mongolic family. The language has distinct features resembling Middle Mongolian and has up to 35% loan words borrowed from Mandarin Chinese. The negligible words of Persian, Turkic and Arabic origin are probably remnants of their original languages before language shift to Dongxiang. The Dongxiang people also have a rich tradition of oral literature and use the Arabic alphabet.

As a result of the language shift, some 20,000 people in several villages in the Northeastern Dongxiang County now speak the so-called &quot;Tangwang language&quot;: a creolized version of Mandarin Chinese with a strong Dongxiang influence, in particular in its grammar.

Government statistics show that the Dongxiang are among the poorest and least literate of China&#x27;s minorities, with most Dongxiang having completed only an average of 1.1 years of schooling, a problem aggravated by the lack of a written language.

In 2004, the Ford Foundation provided US$30,000 in grant money for a pilot project to promote bilingual education in Mandarin and Dongxiang, in an effort to reduce school drop-out rates. The project is credited with the publication of a Dongxiang–Chinese bilingual dictionary as well as recent rises in test scores.

<doc id="330822" wikidata="Q857529" url="?curid=330822" title="Sui people">
<text>The Sui people (; autonym: &quot;ai33 sui33&quot;), also spelled as Shui people, are an ethnic group living mostly in Guizhou Province, China. They are counted as one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

==History==

The Sui are descended from the ancient Baiyue peoples, who had inhabited southern China before the Han dynasty (Wei 2003:viii). The name &quot;Sui,&quot; which means &quot;water&quot; in Chinese, was adopted during the Ming Dynasty.
==Demographics==
Today, 93% of all Sui people (322,000 individuals) reside in Guizhou, China, with 63% of them living in Sandu Shui Autonomous County. To the south, 10,000 Sui live around Yingdong village in Rongshui County, Guangxi (Edmondson 2008). Small pockets of Sui people also live in Fuyang and Yiliang Counties, Yunnan. Additionally, there are 120 Sui living in Hồng Quang District, Tuyên Quang Province, northern Vietnam who are the descendants of Sui people who had left Sandu County 8 generations ago (Wei 2003:vii).

==Language==

The Sui speak a Kra–Dai language, part of the Kam–Sui languages.

==Society==

The Sui are organized around family clans. Villages usually have a few hundred inhabitants, most of whom have the same family name (Wei 2003:ix).

Traditional Sui houses are usually made of fir or pine, although today the houses are increasingly made with bricks. There are three main types of traditional Sui housing (Wei 2003:ix):

# &quot;ɣaan2 faaŋ1&quot; (Chinese: &quot;ganlan mulou&quot;) – The ganlan stilted house, which has two or three stories. The second floor is used for the living quarters whereas the first floor is used primarily as a stable and storage area.
# &quot;ɣaan2 hum5&quot; – The ground house, which has one story.
# The split level house – a &quot;hanging foot&quot; building called &quot;diaojiaolou&quot; in Chinese. These houses are built on hillsides, with longer pillars supporting the downhill-facing side of the house, and are called &quot;hanging house&quot; (diaojiao) since the pillars supporting the house are sometimes located outside the walls.

If a woman is widowed, she covers her hair with a fabric of white color for three years. The Sui possess a lunar calendar that is initiated in the ninth lunar month. Their funeral services are elaborate and long ceremonies where animal sacrifices are carried out in honor of the dead. Except for fish, Sui villagers usually refrain from eating meat after the death of a person (Wei 2003:xvi).

==Cuisine==
The staple food of the Sui people is glutinous rice. Supplementary grains and tubers include corn, wheat, barley, millet, and sweet potatoes. Rice is either steamed in a bamboo steamer or cooked in a covered pot over a low fire. Popular rice-based dishes include &quot;ʔjut7&quot; (Chinese: zongzi) and cooked glutinous rice with chrysanthemum and puffed rice (Wei 2003:xiv). Sui women also give glutinous rice to relatives when visiting them.

Fish is one of the most important sources of food. Like the Dong people, many Sui raise carp in village fishponds (Wei 2003:xiv). A popular dish consumed during the summer is a kind of sour broth called &quot;lu5 hum3&quot;. Sui families also regularly hold communal hot pots. Kippered fish (&quot;hum3 mom6&quot;), kippered meat (&quot;hum3 naan4&quot;), and the meat of suckling pigs are also popular. Rice spirits are popular among the Sui, and are also consumed during marriages, funerals, festivals, and building raising events. The Sui are also famed for their jiuqian wine.

==Festivals==
Festivals include (Wei 2003:xix):
* &quot;tsjə1 twə3&quot; (Duan festival) – This harvest festival is similar to the Chinese New Year. It is held from around September (start of the Sui New Year) to November (second month of the Sui calendar). Livestock meat is not eaten during the Sui New Year&#x27;s Eve (&quot;hət7&quot;). On New Year&#x27;s Day (&quot;ʁaai3&quot;), antiphonal choirs, horse racing, and other festivities are held. Since Sui in different areas celebrate Duan at different times, this festival actually lasts for more than two months when festivities from various locations are combined. A total of five different Duan&#x27;s are celebrated in the following locations (Wei 2003:xx).
#Wangsi in Duyun (Pandong) City
#Malian, Layou, Miaocao, Shuidong in Sandu County
#Tingpai, Hengfeng, Heyong, Tianxing in Sandu, Libo, Dushan Counties
#Zhonghe, Dixiang, Jiuqian in Sandu County
#Sandong, Shuinian, Xingxiang in Sandu County.
* &quot;tsjə1 mau4&quot; (Mao festival) – This four-day festival is celebrated by those who do not celebrate the Duan festival. It occurs after the transplanting of rice seedlings on the tenth month of the Sui calendar. Mao Day is celebrated in the Libo County villages of Shuili, Yaoqing, Shuirao, Shuipu, and Yongkang. Antiphonal-style choirs sing traditional Sui love songs during this festival. However, by tradition married women are not allowed to perform in the choirs.
* &quot;tsjə1 tseŋ1&quot; (spring festival) – This festival is especially elaborate in the Sandu County locales of Bannan, Shuimei, Yanggong, Zhouqin, and Yang&#x27;an. These villages, however, do not celebrate either the Duan or Mao festivals.
* &quot;su3 njen2 hi5&quot; (small Sui new year&#x27;s festival)
* &quot;tsjə1 ʔau4 hmai5&quot; (&quot;eat new rice&quot; festival)
* &quot;Liuyueliu&quot; (&quot;six month six day,&quot; or June 6, festival)
* &quot;si3 ming2&quot; (Qingming) festival
* &quot;Duanwu&quot;
* &quot;sup8 hi5&quot;

The bronze drum is often played during festivals, and singing, dancing, slaughtering livestock for food, and giving thanks to family ancestors are typical of these festivals (Wei 2003:xxii).

==Religion==
The Sui are mainly polytheists and practice ancestor worship as well. Shamans were traditionally hired to carry out prayers and sacrifices in the houses of those that were sick or close to death. The Sui religion has more than 900 ghosts and gods that can cause both good fortune or misfortune (Wei 2003:xxii). Some deities and legendary figures are also borrowed from Chinese folk religion.

The Sui people have a wide array of taboos and superstitions, such as (Wei 2003:xxiv-xxv):
*During the first thunderclap of the start of the spring season, the ground cannot be plowed for three days. Breaking this taboo would anger the thunder god, resulting in abnormal rain patterns.
*Oaths should not be said when seeds are being sown lest there is crop damage.
*The lusheng should not be played after the seeds are sowed during the beginning of spring, or else the seeds might be blown away later.
*On the first morning of the Duan festival as well as the preceding evening, meats of land animals cannot be eaten. Violating this taboo is seen as disrespect towards ancestors and will result in fewer descendants.
*Dogs should not be killed during festival days.
*On the first day of the Spring Festival, houses should not be cleaned, food should not be cooked, and hair may not be cut. Instead, New Year&#x27;s Eve leftovers are eaten.
*During a wedding procession, bad luck may result for a couple if the procession chances upon a coffin (couple may die soon), bird crossing the road (couple may be ill soon), thunder (a sorcerer must be invited to drive out ghosts), or a pregnant woman (the bride will be infertile).
*Remarried widows cannot return to their former husbands&#x27; villages, and cannot visit their parents&#x27; homes for an entire year, or else her parents&#x27; village will not prosper.
*Pregnant women cannot bear children in their parents&#x27; villages, or else her parents&#x27; family and livestock will be harmed.
*After just having a child, if a woman visits another person&#x27;s village or house, that person will fall ill.
*Members of a clan cannot eat meats of land animals after one of their elders has died. The deceased elder&#x27;s clothing and personal items cannot fall to the ground, and he must have an odd number of belongings.
*People born on the same day as a recently deceased person should not visit him, or else the dead may take their souls into the grave.
*Names should not be called out when people are being buried, or the dead may take their soul.
*After the death of a male, sows or cows cannot be killed. After the death of a female, horses or bulls cannot be killed.
*Pregnant women and babies should not be buried in areas which receive much sunshine.
*Solar and lunar eclipses, as well as calls of birds, are not liked by the Sui people.

<doc id="330825" wikidata="Q1280214" url="?curid=330825" title="Sydney Newman">
<text>Sydney Cecil Newman (; April 1, 1917 – October 30, 1997) was a Canadian producer and screenwriter who played a pioneering role in British television drama from the late 1950s to the late 1960s. After his return to Canada in 1970, he was appointed acting director of the Broadcast Programs Branch for the Canadian Radio and Television Commission (CRTC) and then head of the National Film Board of Canada (NFB). He also occupied senior positions at the Canadian Film Development Corporation and Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and acted as an advisor to the Secretary of State.

During his time in Britain in the 1950s and 1960s, Newman worked first with ABC Weekend TV before moving across to the BBC in 1962, holding the role of Head of Drama with both organisations. During this phase of his career, he created the spy-fi series &quot;The Avengers&quot; and co-created the science-fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, as well as overseeing the production of groundbreaking social realist drama series such as &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot; and &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot;.

The Museum of Broadcast Communications describes Newman as &quot;the most significant agent in the development of British television drama&quot;. His obituary in &quot;The Guardian&quot; declared that &quot;for ten brief but glorious years, Sydney Newman ... was the most important impresario in Britain ... His death marks not just the end of an era but the laying to rest of a whole philosophy of popular art.&quot; In Quebec, as commissioner of the NFB, he attracted controversy for his decision to suppress distribution of several politically sensitive films by French Canadian directors.

==Early career in Canada==

===Early life and the NFB===
Sydney Cecil Nudelman was born in Toronto on April 1, 1917, the son of a Russian-Jewish immigrant father who ran a shoe shop. After studying at Ogden Public School, which he left at the age of 13, he later enrolled in the Central Technical School, studying art and design subjects. He initially attempted to follow a career as a stills photographer and an artist, specialising in drawing film posters. However, he found it so difficult to earn enough money to make a living from this profession that he switched to working in the film industry itself.

In 1938, Newman travelled to Hollywood, where he was offered a role with the Walt Disney Company on the strength of his graphic design work. However, he was unable to take the job because he could not secure a work permit. Returning to Canada in 1941, he gained a job as a film editor at the National Film Board of Canada. He was eventually to work on over 350 films while an editor for the NFB. During the Second World War the head of the NFB, John Grierson, promoted Newman to film producer, working on documentaries and propaganda films, including &quot;Fighting Norway&quot;, which he directed. In 1944, he was made executive producer of &quot;Canada Carries On&quot;, a long-running series of such films. In 1949, the NFB invited him into television, then a new industry, on a one-year attachment to NBC in New York City. His assignment there was to compile reports for the Canadian government on American television techniques, focusing on dramas, documentaries and outside broadcasts.

===CBC Television===
One of Newman&#x27;s reports on outside broadcasting was seen and admired by executives at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), and in 1952 he joined the corporation as its Supervising Director of Features, Documentaries and Outside Broadcasts. There he was involved in producing not only some of the earliest television editions of &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;, but also the first Canadian Football League game to be shown on television. After his experience of seeing the production of television plays in New York, he was eager to work in drama despite, by his own admission, &quot;knowing nothing about drama&quot;. He was nonetheless able to persuade his superiors at CBC to make him Supervisor of Drama Production in 1954. In this position he encouraged a new wave of young writers and directors, including Ted Kotcheff and Arthur Hailey, and oversaw shows such as the popular &quot;General Motors Theatre&quot;.

Writing in 1990, the journalist Paul Rutherford felt that during his time at the CBC in the 1950s, Newman had been a &quot;great champion of both realistic and Canadian drama&quot;. He felt that Newman &quot;came to fulfil the role of the drama impresario with the vision to push people to develop a high-quality and popular style of drama&quot;.

Several of the &quot;General Motors Theatre&quot; plays, including Hailey&#x27;s &quot;Flight into Danger&quot;, were purchased for screening by the BBC in the United Kingdom. The productions impressed Howard Thomas, who was the managing director of ABC Weekend TV, the franchise holder for the rival ITV network in the English Midlands and the North at weekends. Thomas offered Newman a job with ABC as a producer of his own Saturday night thriller series, which Newman accepted, moving to Britain in 1958. In 1975 the Head of Drama at the CBC, John Hirsch, noted that the tendency of so many writers and directors, having followed Newman to the UK in the 1950s, to never return to work in Canada had a detrimental impact on the standard of subsequent Canadian television drama.

==ABC Weekend TV and ITV==

Soon after Newman arrived in the UK, ABC&#x27;s Head of Drama Dennis Vance was moved into a more senior position with the company, and Thomas offered Newman his position, which the Canadian quickly accepted. He was, however, somewhat disparaging of the state in which he found British television drama. &quot;At that time, I found this country to be somewhat class-ridden,&quot; he reminisced to interviewers in 1988. &quot;The only legitimate theatre was of the &#x27;anyone for tennis&#x27; variety, which on the whole gave a condescending view of working-class people. Television dramas were usually adaptations of stage plays and invariably about the upper classes. I said, &#x27;Damn the upper classes: they don&#x27;t even &quot;own&quot; televisions!&#x27;&quot;

Newman&#x27;s principal tool for shaking up this established order was a programme which had been initiated before he had arrived at ABC, &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot;. This anthology series was networked nationally across the ITV regions on Sunday evenings, and in 1959 was in the top ten of the ratings for 32 out of the it was broadcast, with audiences of over viewers. Newman used the strand to present plays by writers such as Alun Owen, Harold Pinter and Clive Exton, also bringing over associates from Canada such as Charles Jarrott and Ted Kotcheff. Writing in 2000, the television historian John Caughie stated that &quot;Newman&#x27;s insistence that the series would use only original material written for television made &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot; a decisive moment in the history of British television drama.&quot;

In 1960 Newman devised a thriller series for ABC called &quot;Police Surgeon&quot;, starring Ian Hendry. Although &quot;Police Surgeon&quot; was not a success and was cancelled after only a short run, Newman took Hendry as the star, and some of the ethos of the programme, to create a new series (not a direct sequel as is sometimes claimed) called &quot;The Avengers&quot;. Debuting in January 1961, &quot;The Avengers&quot; became an international success, although in later years its premise differed somewhat from Newman&#x27;s initial set-up, veering into more humorous territory rather than remaining a gritty thriller.

Newman&#x27;s great success at ABC had been noted by the British Broadcasting Corporation, whose executives were keen to revive their own drama department&#x27;s fortunes in the face of fierce competition from ITV. In 1961 the BBC&#x27;s Director of Television, Kenneth Adam, met with Newman and offered him the position of Head of Drama at the BBC. He accepted the position, eager for a new challenge, although he was obliged to remain with ABC until the expiration of his contract in December 1962, after which he immediately began work with the BBC.

==BBC==

===Arrival and impact===
There was some initial resentment to his appointment within the corporation, as he was an outsider and he was also earning more than many of the executives senior to him, although still substantially less than he had been paid at ABC. As he had done at ABC, he was keen to shake up the staid image of BBC drama and introduce new outlets for the kitchen sink drama and the &quot;Angry Young Men&quot; of the era. He also divided the drama department into three divisions—series, serials and plays.

In 1964 he and Kenneth Adam initiated the anthology series &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot;, a BBC equivalent of &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot;, which had great success and critical acclaim with plays written and directed by the likes of Dennis Potter, Jeremy Sandford and Ken Loach. The strand attracted comment and debate for several of its productions, such as &quot;Cathy Come Home&quot;, a Tony Garnett production of a Jeremy Sandford script, which portrayed homelessness. There were also problems caused by Newman bringing in freelance directors to work on the programme, who sometimes overspent on their plays to try and increase their impact; with staff directors this could be compensated by reducing the budget of a subsequent production, but for a freelancer there would be no such recourse.

Shaun Sutton was one of the drama producers who worked under Newman at the BBC, and later succeeded him as Head of Drama. He later wrote that Newman &quot;galvanised television drama ... [He created] a climate in which boldness paid&quot;. Don Taylor, who was a director in the drama department at the time, later claimed that he felt Newman was unsuited to the position of Head of Drama, writing: &quot;To put it brutally, I was deeply offended that the premier position in television drama, at a time when it really was the National Theatre of the Air, had been given to a man whose values were entirely commercial, and who had no more than a layman&#x27;s knowledge of the English theatrical tradition, let alone the drama of Europe and the wider world.&quot;

Newman&#x27;s biography at the Museum of Broadcast Communications website points out that much of the work Newman is credited for at the BBC was little different from that which had been undertaken by his predecessor Michael Barry, who &quot;also attracted new young original writers ... and hired young directors ... However, it was the newness and innovation which Newman encouraged in his drama output that is most significant: his concentration on the potential of television as television, for a mass not a middlebrow audience.&quot; The academic Madeleine Macmurraugh-Kavanagh has criticised some of the eulogistic views of Newman&#x27;s time at the BBC: &quot;When archive and press material emanating from the 1964–65 period is examined, an interesting gap appears between what Newman seemed likely to accomplish and what he finally did accomplish ... Also relevant to the mythology that has sprung up around Newman is the fact that his favoured dramatic material was interpreted by some as being rather less radical than it seemed.&quot;

===&quot;Doctor Who&quot;===
In 1963 he initiated the creation of a science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The series has been described by the British Film Institute as having &quot;created a phenomenon unlike any other British TV programme&quot; and by &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper as &quot;quintessential to being British&quot;. Newman had long been a science-fiction fan: &quot;[U]p to the age of 40, I don&#x27;t think there was a science-fiction book I hadn&#x27;t read. I love them because they&#x27;re a marvellous way—and a &quot;safe&quot; way, I might add—of saying nasty things about our own society.&quot;

When Controller of BBC Television Donald Baverstock told Newman of the need for a programme to bridge the gap between the sports showcase &quot;Grandstand&quot; and pop music programme &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot; on Saturday evenings, he decided that a science-fiction drama would be the perfect vehicle for filling the gap and gaining a family audience. Although much work on the genesis of the series was done by Donald Wilson, C. E. Webber and others, it was Newman who created the idea of the TARDIS, a time machine &quot;larger on the inside&quot;, and the character of the mysterious &quot;Doctor&quot;, both of which remain at the heart of the programme. The origin of the title &quot;Doctor Who&quot; is less clear; actor and director Hugh David later credited this to his friend Rex Tucker, the initial &quot;caretaker producer&quot; of the programme, although Tucker said the title had come from Newman. In a 1971 interview, Donald Wilson claimed to have named the series and when this claim was put to Newman he did not dispute it.

After the series had been conceived, Newman approached Don Taylor and then Shaun Sutton to produce it, although both declined. Newman then decided on his former production assistant at ABC, Verity Lambert, who had never produced, written or directed, but she readily accepted his offer. As Lambert became the youngest—and only female—drama producer at the BBC, there were some doubts as to Newman&#x27;s choice, but she became a success in the role. Even Newman clashed with her on occasion, particularly over the inclusion of the alien Dalek creatures in the programme. Newman had not wanted any &quot;bug-eyed monsters&quot; in the show but he was placated when the creatures became a great success. In the 2007 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;Human Nature&quot;, the Doctor (in human form as &quot;John Smith&quot;) refers to his parents Sydney and Verity, a tribute to both Newman and Lambert.

===Other work and departure===
Newman also had success with more traditional BBC fare such as the costume drama &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot; in 1967, a Donald Wilson project on which Newman had not initially been keen. It became one of the most acclaimed and popular productions of his era, watched by people in 26 countries. After also initiating other popular series such as &quot;Adam Adamant Lives!&quot;, at the end of 1967 Newman&#x27;s five-year contract with the BBC came to an end, and he did not remain with the corporation. Newman returned to the film industry, taking a job as a producer with Associated British Picture Corporation. &quot;I want to get away from my executive&#x27;s chair and become a creative worker again&quot;, he told &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper of his decision. The British film industry was entering a period of decline and none of Newman&#x27;s projects went into production. ABPC was taken over by EMI and at the end of June 1969, Newman was dismissed from the company, later describing his eighteen months there as &quot;a futile waste&quot;. Despite being offered an executive producership by the BBC, keen to regain his services on the day he left ABPC, Newman decided to return to Canada. He left the UK on January 3, 1970, leading &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; to comment that &quot;British television will never be the same again&quot;.

==Return to Canada==

===Chairman of the NFB===
His first post upon returning to his home country was an advisory position with the Canadian Radio and Television Commission (CRTC) in Ottawa, where he battled Canada&#x27;s private broadcasters, especially CTV, over new Canadian content regulations. This lasted for only a few months, before in August 1970 he became the new Government Film Commissioner, the Chairman of the National Film Board of Canada, returning to the same institution for which he had worked in the 1940s. In this role he experienced considerable problems in Quebec resulting from the fact that he did not speak French, at a time when the NFB&#x27;s French Program branch was attracting young Quebec nationalist filmmakers. Some staff members also felt that he had been away from the NFB for too long, while the filmmaker Denys Arcand felt that Newman did not understand Quebec culture.

Newman was able to improve the NFB&#x27;s relations with broadcaster CBC, securing prime-time television slots for several productions, although he was criticised by some filmmakers for allowing the CBC to screen NFB films with commercial interruptions. He also moved the NFB entirely over to color film production. However, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;″s Martin Knelman felt that Newman was &quot;mired in political warfare and administrative chaos&quot;. He was responsible for censoring or banning several productions, including Arcand&#x27;s &quot;On est au coton&quot; and Gilles Groulx&#x27;s &quot;24 heures ou plus&quot;. These films were concerned, respectively, with the conditions of textile factory workers and critiquing consumer society. Such censorship or banning resulted in some critics attacking Newman for being anti-working-class and pro-capitalist.

Newman had a mixed record with French-language films. He defended Pierre Perrault&#x27;s &quot;Un pays sans bon sens!&quot; to a committee of parliament in 1971, but in the same year personally rejected the release of Michel Brault&#x27;s film about the October Crisis, &quot;Orders (Les Ordres)&quot;. This was despite the fact that the film had already been approved by the board&#x27;s French-language committee, and it was not eventually released until Brault personally released it in 1974.

Newman himself had been regarded as a possible terrorist abduction target during the October Crisis, and armed guards had patrolled the headquarters of the NFB. Newman was concerned about the idea of releasing films with Quebec nationalist themes, such as Groulx&#x27;s &quot;24 heures ou plus&quot;, at such a tense political time, worried about what the Canadian public would think. Although it was Newman&#x27;s deputy André Lamy who in some cases drew the monolingual Newman&#x27;s attention to the controversial nature of French-language productions, it was Lamy himself who later permitted the release of some of these same films after he succeeded Newman as Government Film Commissioner.

When Newman&#x27;s contract with the NFB came to an end in 1975, it was not renewed. Film historian Gerald Pratley claims that by this point, the NFB was &quot;an almost-forgotten institution&quot; due to &quot;the stupor that had overtaken it.&quot; The writer Richard Collins felt that &quot;the very experiences that enabled [Newman] to recognize the nature of the NFB&#x27;s problem and the need for a change of diction and reorientation to the tastes of Canadians had left him out of touch with Canada.&quot; For his part, Newman felt that the NFB&#x27;s French program had not made enough effort to communicate with people in English Canada or to make films that were relevant to &quot;the ordinary men, who have no particular axe to grind.&quot;

Newman went on to become a Special Advisor on Film to the Secretary of State, and from 1978 until 1984 he was Chief Creative Consultant to the Canadian Film Development Corporation.

===Later years===
Newman was awarded the Order of Canada in 1981, the country&#x27;s highest civilian honour. Shortly thereafter he returned to live in Britain again for some time following the death in 1981 of his wife Elizabeth McRae, to whom he had been married since 1944. His main reason for going back to the UK was to attempt, unsuccessfully, to produce a drama series about the Bloomsbury Group for the new Channel 4 network.

In 1986, the then Controller of BBC One, Michael Grade, unhappy with the current state of &quot;Doctor Who,&quot; wrote to Newman to enquire whether he had any ideas for reformatting the series, which was at the time struggling in the ratings and with its star Colin Baker about to be fired by Grade. On October 6, 1986, Newman wrote back to Grade with a suggestion that he take direct control of the series as executive producer, that Patrick Troughton should return to the role of the Doctor for a season, and then regenerate into a female, with Newman suggesting either Joanna Lumley, Dawn French or Frances de la Tour to succeed Troughton. Grade then suggested that Newman meet the current Head of Drama, Jonathan Powell, for lunch to discuss the Canadian&#x27;s ideas. Newman and Powell did not get on well, however, and nothing came of their meeting. Newman was also unsuccessful in an attempt to have his name added to the end credits of the show as its creator. Acting Head of Series &amp; Serials Ken Riddington, to whom Newman&#x27;s request had been referred, wrote to him that &quot;Heads of Department who originate programmes have to be satisfied with the other rewards that flow from doing so.&quot;

Newman returned to Canada again in the 1990s, where he died of a heart attack in Toronto in 1997, aged 80. At the time of his death, his partner was Marion McDougall.

==Legacy==
In September 2003, a version of Newman played by actor Ian Brooker appeared in the straight-to-CD &quot;Doctor Who Unbound&quot; radio play &quot;Deadline,&quot; written by Rob Shearman and released by Big Finish Productions. The play was set in a world in which &quot;Doctor Who&quot; had never been created, existing only in the imagination and memories of fictional writer Martin Bannister, played by Derek Jacobi. As part of the plot of the play, Bannister was unable to clearly remember whether Newman had been Canadian or Australian, with the Newman character&#x27;s accent changing according to Bannister&#x27;s varying memories.

For the fiftieth anniversary of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in 2013, BBC television commissioned a dramatisation of the events surrounding the creation of the series, entitled &quot;An Adventure in Space and Time&quot; and written by Mark Gatiss. Newman was portrayed by Scottish actor Brian Cox.

A biography of Newman by Ryan Danes, titled &quot;The Man Who Thought Outside the Box&quot;, was released in April 2017 by Digital Entropy Publishing.

<doc id="330826" wikidata="Q852205" url="?curid=330826" title="Monguor people">
<text>The Monguor (Monguor language: Mongghul), the Tu people (), the White Mongol or the Tsagaan Mongol, are Mongolic people and one of the 56 officially recognized ethnic groups in China.

According to the 2000 census, the total population was 241,198, who mostly lived in the Qinghai and the Gansu provinces. The 2010 census gave their number as 289,565. The Monguor people speak the Monguor language, which belongs to the family of Mongolic languages but has been heavily influenced by both the local Chinese and Tibetan dialects. Today, nearly all Tu people also speak Chinese. Most are farmers and some keep livestock.

Their culture and the social organizations have been influenced by Tibetan Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism and local beliefs. A few Tu in Huzhu and Minhe are Christian, the result of on-going American and Korean missionary work in the area.

==Ethnic origins==

The ethnic history of the Monguor is contested. It has been variously suggested that their origins are related to the Tuyuhun Xianbei, to Mongol troops who came to the current Qinghai-Gansu area during the time of the Mongol conquests, to the Shatuo and/or to the Han Chinese.

===Terminology===

====Origins====
Some references argue that the Chinese term &quot;Tu&quot; was derived from the name of Tuyühu Khan, who was the older son of the King of Murong Xianbei who migrated westward from the northeast in 284. The last character of Tuyühu, pronounced as &quot;hun&quot; today, may have been pronounced &quot;hu&quot; in some dialect of ancient Chinese language. The contemporary reference of this name is rendered &quot;Tuyuhun&quot; in China and the West should be &quot;Tuyühu.&quot; It came from the Chinese phonetic transcription of his original name &quot;Teihu&quot;, which is still a common name seen among the Monguor today. Since the Chinese language cannot represent &quot;Tei,&quot; two characters of &quot;Tu&quot; and &quot;yü&quot; were used. The ethnonym &quot;Tu&quot; in Chinese came from the abbreviation of &quot;the Tuyühu people&quot; or &quot;the people of the Tuyühu Empire.&quot; Between the years 908 and 1042, the reference became simplified into &quot;Tuhu&quot; and &quot;Tüihu&quot; people. As the other ethnic groups of the Tuyühu Empire came to be ascribed with different ethnonyms through subsequent history, the Xianbei who founded the empire remained to bear with the identity of &quot;Tu.&quot;

The name &quot;Tu&quot; was most likely associated with a derogatory meaning and &quot;indigenous people&quot;. Its derogatory undertone came from the concurrent meaning of the Chinese character &quot;Tu&quot; for &quot;soil.&quot; The ethnonym &quot;Tu&quot; is increasingly a self-reference.

====Monguor====
The reference of &quot;Monguor&quot; in the Western publications came from their self-reference as &quot;Chaghan Monguor&quot; (or &quot;White Mongols&quot;). It was derived from their origins from the Murong Xianbei, from whom Tuyühu Khan separated and who had been historically referred to as &quot;the White Section&quot; or &quot;Bai Bu,&quot; due to their lighter skin. The term &quot;Monguor&quot; was first used by the European Catholic missionaries, Smedt and Mosaert, who studied the Monguor language and compiled a Monguor-French dictionary in the beginning of the twentieth century. Subsequently, the Flemish Catholic missionary, Louis Schram, made it into an international name through three volumes of extensive reports based on his experiences from having lived among them from 1911 to 1922. The term is a variant pronunciation of &quot;Mongol&quot; in the Monguor language, characterized by the final &quot;-r&quot; in place of &quot;-l&quot; in the Mongolian language.

Despite that &quot;Monguor&quot; was made into an international name for the &quot;Tu,&quot; it is not representative: the reference is only used by the Monguor in Huzhu and Datong counties in Qinghai, and when used, it should be combined with &quot;Chaghan&quot; (or &quot;White&quot;) in order to be distinguished from the &quot;Khara&quot; (or &quot;Black&quot;) Mongols. In Minhe County, which holds the most densely populated &quot;Monguor&quot; settlement and where everyone speaks their native &quot;Monguor&quot; language, it is never used as an autonym.

==Genetic studies==
Sequences in the DNA of the Tu people indicate that people similar to modern Greeks mixed with an East Asian population around 1200 BC, contributing about 7,7% to the Tu genepool. The source of this European DNA might have been merchants travelling the Silk Road. This admixture may come from an earlier period as many of their carnival-like festivals and masked fertility rituals have similarities in the Hellenistic times with Dionysian representations, not in Byzantine Christian-era Greek celebrations.

==History==

===Donghu===
Their earliest origins from the Donghu are reflected in their account of the unique wedding ceremony attributed to Madam Lushi, who organized an ambush through an elaborate banquet combined with liquor and singing in order to subdue a bully named &quot;Wang Mang&quot;. In historical terms, the &quot;Wang Mang&quot; people were recorded more than four thousand years ago as physically robust and active on the west of the present Liaoning, whose culture was associated with the Hongshan Culture. In archaeological terms, the Hongshan Culture gradually gave rise to the Lower Xiajiadian Culture and represented the transition toward the bronze technology. It eventually evolved into the Upper Xiajidian Culture, which was associated with the Donghu and characterized by the practice of agriculture and animal husbandry supplemented by handicrafts and bronze art. The Donghu was a federation formed from the Donghu, Wuhuan, and Xianbei.

Among the northern ethnic groups, the Donghu was the earliest to evolve into a state of civilization and first developed bronze technology. Through the usage of bronze weaponry and armored cavalry in warfare, they maintained extensive dominance over the Xiongnu on their west. In the end of the third century B.C., the Xiongnu Maodun attacked to destroy the Donghu by surprise and caused disintegration in the federation. The Wuhuan moved to Mt. Wuhuan and engaged in continuous warfare with the Xiongnu on the west and China on the south. The Donghu spoke Mongolic language and was formed by the federation of the Donghu, Wuhuan, and Xianbei.

===Xianbei===
As the Wuhuan and Xiongnu came to be worn out from the lengthy battles, the Xianbei preserved their strengths by moving northward to Mt. Xianbei. In the first century, the Xianbei defeated the Wuhuan and northern Xiongnu, and developed into a powerful state under the leadership of their elected Khan, Tanshihuai. In the third century, the Eastern Han dynasty (25–220 BC) disintegrated into three kingdoms, including the Cao Wei (220–265) in the north, the Eastern Wu (222–280) in the south, and the Shu Han (221–263) in the southwest. In 235, the Cao Wei assassinated the last Khan of the Xianbei, Kebineng, and caused disintegration in the Xianbei Kingdom. Thereafter, the Xianbei pushed their way inside the Great Wall of China and established extensive presence in China.

During the Sixteen Kingdoms (304–439) period, the Xianbei founded six kingdoms: the Former Yan (281–370), Western Yan (384–394), Later Yan (383–407), Southern Yan (398–410), Western Qin (385–430) and Southern Liang (397–414). Most of them were unified by the Tuoba Xianbei, who established the Northern Wei (386–535), which was the first of the Northern dynasties (386–581) founded by the Xianbei. In 534, the Northern Wei split into an Eastern Wei (534–550) and a Western Wei (535–556). The former evolved into the Northern Qi (550–577), and the latter into the Northern Zhou (557–581), while the Southern dynasties were pushed to the south of the Yangtze. In 581, the prime minister of Northern Zhou, Yang Jian, usurped the throne and founded the Sui dynasty (581–618) as Emperor Wen of Sui. His son, Emperor Yang of Sui, annihilated the Chen dynasty (557–589) and unified northern and southern China, thereby bringing an end to the Northern and Southern dynasties era. Over the course of this period, the Xianbei who entered into China were immersed among the Chinese and later classified into &quot;Han&quot;. Yet, not all branches of the Xianbei shared this fate. In the 3rd and 4th centuries, Tuyühu, a branch of the Murong Xianbei, undertook a westward migration that allowed them and those who followed them to develop in a different path.

===Westward migration===

The separation of Tuyühu from the Murong Xianbei occurred during the Western Jin dynasty (265–316), which succeeded the Cao Wei (220–265) in northern China. Legends accounted the separation to be due to a fight between his horses and those of his younger brother, Murong Wei. The actual cause was intense struggle over the Khanate position and disagreement over their future directions. The fraction that supported Murong Wei into the Khanate position aimed at ruling over China, whereas Tuyühu intended to preserve the Xianbei culture and lifestyles. The disagreement resulted in Tuyühu to proclaim as the Khan, or Kehan, and undertook the long westward journey under the title of the Prince of Jin, or Jin Wang, followed by other Xianbei and Wuhuan groups. While passing through western Liaoning and Mt. Bai, more Xianbei groups joined them from the Duan, Yuwen, and Bai sections. At the Hetao Plains near Ordos in Inner Mongolia, Tuyühu Khan led them to reside by Mt. Yin for over thirty years, as the Tuoba Xianbei and Northern Xianbei joined them through political and marriage alliances. After settling down in the northwest, they established the powerful Tuyühu Empire named to his honor as the first Khan who led them there, by subjugating the native peoples who were summarily referred to as the &quot;Qiang&quot; and included more than 100 different and loosely coordinated tribes that did not submit to each other or any authorities.

After Tuyühu Khan departed from the northeast, Murong Wei composed an &quot;Older Brother’s Song,&quot; or &quot;the Song of A Gan:&quot; &quot;A Gan&quot; is Chinese transcription of &quot;a ga&quot; for &quot;older brother&quot; in the Xianbei language. The song lamented his sadness and longing for Tuyühu. Legends accounted that Murong Wei often sang it until he died and the song got spread into central and northwest China. The Murong Xianbei whom he had led successively founded the Former Yan (281–370), Western Yan (384–394), Later Yan (383–407), and Southern Yan (398–410). Their territories encompassed, at their height, the present Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan, and their capitals included Beijing and other cities. Through these establishments, they were immersed among the Chinese, whereas the Xianbei who followed Tuyühu Khan preserved their language and culture.

====Mt. Xianbei====
In the extensive migrations that the Xianbei undertook in the northeast, northern, and northwest China, the name of Mt. Xianbei was found along their trajectories. The earliest recorded Mt. Xianbei was in the southern portions of Daxinganling, located in northeast Inner Mongolia, which represented the originating place of the Xianbei. Two Mt. Xianbei were recorded subsequently in western Liaoning: one in the present Jinzhou City and one near Yi County. Another Mt. Xianbei was recorded in the northern portions of Daxinganling, located near Alihe Town of Oroqin Autonomous Banner in Hulunbeiermeng in the northeastern portion of Inner Mongolia that borders eastern Russia. The Gaxian Cave, currently Khabarovsk and Amur regions in the Russian Far East, which had stone inscriptions of the Northern Wei emperor dated 443, was recognized to be the sacred ancestral shrine of the Xianbei. In the northwest, the Qilian Mountains that run along Gansu and Qinghai provinces were referred to as the Greater Mt. Xianbei. In Sanchuan/Guanting of Minhe County in Qinghai, which holds the most densely populated Monguor settlement, Mt. Xianbei stands in the west, upon which sits the ancestral shrine of the Xianbei Khans.

===Tuyuhun Empire===
After Tuyühu Khan died in Linxia, also known as Huozhou, Gansu in 317, his sixty sons inherited to further develop the empire, by annihilating the Western Qin (385–430), which had annexed Southern Liang (396–414) earlier, and Haolian Xia (407–431) kingdoms, from which the Qinghai Xianbei, Tufa Xianbei, Qifu Xianbei and Haolian Xianbei joined them. These Xianbei groups formed the core of the Tuyuhun Empire and numbered about 3.3 million at their peak. They carried out extensive military expeditions westward, reaching as far as Hetian in Xinjiang and the borders of India and Afghanistan, and established a vast empire that encompassed Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, northern Sichuan, eastern Shaanxi, southern Xinjiang, and most of Tibet, stretching 1,500 kilometers from the east to the west and 1,000 kilometers from the north to the south. They unified northwest China for the first time in history, developed the southern route of the Silk Road, and promoted cultural exchanges between the eastern and western territories, dominating the northwest for more than three and half centuries until the empire was destroyed by the Tibetans who rose up in 670.

====Tibet====
The Xianbei asserted cultural imprint in the region. The English reference for &quot;Tibet&quot; may have come from the Xianbei language for Tibetans &quot;Tiebie,&quot; in contrast to the self-reference of the Tibetans as &quot;Bo&quot;. The name &quot;Tiebie&quot; may have come from the Tuoba Xianbei who founded the Southern Liang (397–414). The Tuoba established the Northern Wei (386–535) and objected to the Tuoba of Southern Liang using the Chinese characters for &quot;Tufa.&quot; They shared Tuoba descent. After the Southern Liang were annexed by the Western Qin, and then annexed by the Tuyühu Empire, the majority of Tufa Xianbei joined the Tuyühu Empire. Some submitted under the Northern Wei in China, while a small fraction went into Tibet and gave rise to the name &quot;Tiebie&quot;. In the ancient Chinese records, the reference of Tibet included &quot;Tubo&quot; and &quot;Tufan,&quot; which reflected the Chinese transcriptions of &quot;Tuoba&quot; and &quot;Tufa.&quot; It is likely that &quot;Tuoba&quot; recorded in the Chinese language may have been pronounced as &quot;Tiebie&quot; originally in the Xianbei language. Among the Monguor settlement in Minhe, Qinghai today, the La and Bao Family Villages were accounted to have descended from &quot;Tiebie&quot;, indicating that they have derived their origins from the Tufa (Tuoba) Xianbei of the Southern Liang. The Tibetans refer to the Monguor as &quot;Huo’er,&quot; which came from the final word of the name of Tuyühu Khan. The Monguor refer to Tuyühu Khan as &quot;Huozhou didi;&quot; in which &quot;Huozhou&quot; was applied to Linxia, Gansu where Tuyühu Khan died, and &quot;didi&quot; was traditionally a reverence term for a deceased ancestor with deity status. The earliest record of the Monguor in the Western publications was made by the French missionaries, Huc and Gabet, who traveled through northwest China in 1844–46. They used &quot;Dschiahour&quot; to represent the Monguor, based on Tibetan reference, in which &quot;Dschia&quot; was likely abbreviated from the first part of &quot;Chaghan&quot; (or &quot;White&quot;) from the self-reference of the Monguor as &quot;Chaghan Monguor&quot; (or &quot;White Mongols&quot;), and &quot;Hour&quot; was a variant record to the Tibetan reference of the Monguor as &quot;Huo’er&quot; used by the Tibetans today.

===Rise of Tibet===
In the beginning of the Tang dynasty, the Tuyühu Empire came to a gradual decline and was increasingly caught in the conflict between the Tang and the Tibetan Empire. Because the Tuyühu Empire controlled the crucial trade routes between the east and the west, the Empire became the immediate target of invasion by the Tang. Meanwhile, the Tibetan Empire developed rapidly under the leadership of Songtsen Gampo, who united the Tibetans and expanded northward, directly threatening the Tuyühu Empire. The exile Tuyühu Khan, Dayan, submitted under Tibet, which resorted to an excuse that Tuyühu objected its marriage with the Tang and sent 200,000 troops to attack. The Tuyühu troops retreated to Qinghai, whereas Tibet went eastward to attack the Tangut and reached into southern Gansu. The Tang government was shocked and sent (five ???) troops to fight. Although Tibet withdrew in response, the Tuyühu Empire lost much of its territory in southern Gansu. Meanwhile, the Tuyühu government was split between the pro-Tang and pro-Tibet factions, with the latter becoming increasingly stronger and corroborating with Tibet to bring about an invasion. The Tang sent its famous general, Xue Rengui, to lead 100,000 troops to fight Tibet in Dafeichuan (present Gonghe County in Qinghai). They were annihilated in an ambush by 200,000 troops of Dayan and Tibet, which became the biggest debacle in the Tang history, and formally brought the Tuyühu Empire to an end.

After its fall in 670, the Tuyühu Empire split into an Eastern and Western Kingdom. The Eastern Kingdom existed on the eastern side of the Qilian Mountains and increasingly migrated eastward into central China, whereas the Western Kingdom existed under the leadership of the former exile Khan, Dayan, in Tibet. As the An Lushan Rebellion shook up the Tang court and caused its emperor to flee, Tibet overtook the entire territory of Tuyühu until internal turmoil developed within the Tibetan government and massive revolts brought an end to its rule. Through this period, the Xianbei underwent massive diasporas over a vast territory that stretched from the northwest into central and eastern parts of China, with the greatest concentrations found by Mt. Yin near Ordos. In 946, the Shatuo Turk, Liu Zhiyuan, conspired to murder the highest Xianbei leader, Bai Chengfu, who was reportedly so wealthy that &quot;his horses had silver mangers&quot;. With that stolen wealth, which included an abundance of property and thousands of fine horses, Liu established the Later Han (947–950), the shortest dynasty in Chinese history, lasting only four years. The incident took away the central leadership and removed any possibility for the Xianbei to restore the Tuyühu Empire.

===Western Xia Empire===
The Western Xia Empire inherited the political and social structures of the Tang and further developed an outstanding civilization characterized as &quot;shining and sparkling&quot;. It became the new kingdom for the descendants of the Tuyühu Xianbei who had lost their country. The Western Xia made significant achievements in literature, art, music, architecture, and chemistry. Through effective military organizations that integrated cavalry, chariots, archery, shields, artillery (cannons carried on the back of camels), and amphibious troops for combats on the land and water, the Xia army maintained a powerful stance in opposition to the Song, Liao (916–1125), and Jin (1115–1234) empires to its east, the last of which was founded by the Jurchens, who were the predecessors of the Manchus who would found the Qing dynasty (1644–1912). The Xia territory encompassed the present Ningxia, Gansu, eastern Qinghai, northern Shaanxi, northeastern Xinjiang, southwest Inner Mongolia, and southernmost Outer Mongolia, spanning about 800,000 square kilometers. In the beginning of the thirteenth century, Genghis Khan unified the northern grasslands of Mongolia and led the Mongol troops to carry out six rounds of attacks against Western Xia over a period of twenty-two years. As Western Xia resisted vehemently, more and more of its people crossed the Qilian Mountains to join the earlier establishments in Qinghai and Gansu in order to avoid the Mongol assaults, which gave rise to the current settlements of the Monguor. During the last round of attacks, Genghis Khan died in Western Xia. The official Mongol historical account attributed his death to an illness, whereas legends told that he died from a wound inflicted in the battles. After the Xia capital was overrun in 1227, the Mongols destroyed much of hu its architecture and written records, killing the last emperor and massacring tens of thousands of civilians. The Xia troops were later incorporated into the Mongol army in their subsequent military conquests in central and southern China. Due to the fierce resistance of the Xia against the Mongol attacks, especially in causing the death of Genghis, they were initially suppressed in the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368). Toward the middle and later stages of the Yuan, the Xia received equivalent treatment to the ruling Mongols and attained the highest offices in the Central Court. After the Yuan fell, the Xia who followed the Mongols into the northern grassland were immersed among and later classified into the &quot;Mongols.&quot;

====Tangut-Xixia====
The English reference of &quot;Tangut-Xixia&quot; was derived from the combination of the Mongolian reference of &quot;Tangut&quot; and the Chinese reference as &quot;Xixia&quot; or &quot;Western Xia.&quot; The Chinese reference was derived from the location of the empire on the western side of the Yellow River, in contrast to the Liao (916–1125) and Jin on its east. The Mongolian usage of &quot;Tangut&quot; most likely referred to the &quot;Donghu people;&quot; &quot;-t&quot; in Mongolian language means &quot;people&quot;. Whereas &quot;Donghu&quot; was a Chinese transcription, its Mongolian reference was &quot;Tünghu&quot;. By the time that the Mongols emerged in the thirteenth century, the only &quot;Donghu people&quot; who existed were the &quot;Tu&quot; in Western Xia.

That the Mongols referred to Western Xia as &quot;Tangut&quot; to represent the founding ethnic group, the Tuyühu Xianbei, is consistent with the theories of the Mongol origins postulated by the Outer Mongolian scholars, who have held that the Mongols had descended from the Xiongnu, more specifically the eastern Xiongnu who spoke proto-Mongolic language, as opposed to the western Xiongnu who spoke proto-Turkish language. In contrast, the Chinese scholars have characterized that the Mongols had descended from the Xianbei. The Mongols were recorded as &quot;Mengwu Shiwei&quot; in the Northern dynasties: &quot;Mengwu&quot; was a variant Chinese transcription of &quot;Menggu&quot; designated to the Mongols, and &quot;Shiwei&quot; was a variant transcription of the Xianbei, as &quot;Xianbei&quot; was also recorded as &quot;Sian-pie,&quot; &quot;Serbi,&quot; &quot;Sirbi&quot; and &quot;Sirvi&quot;. This equated the Mongols to be &quot;Mongol Xianbei,&quot; which was likely associated with the submission of the Xiongnu under Xianbei. In 87 A.D., the Xianbei defeated the northern Xiongnu and killed their king, Chanyu Youliu, causing its thorough disintegration. Thereafter, the Xiongnu submitted under and self-proclaimed to be Xianbei. This resulted in a mix of the Xiongnu into Xianbei and made it difficult to differentiate the two groups in subsequent historical records. That the Mongolian term &quot;Tangut&quot; represented &quot;the Donghu people,&quot; the Xianbei and their descendants who had founded the Tuyühu and Western Xia empires, would validate the theories of the Outer Mongolian scholars that the Mongols had descended from the Xiongnu. The fact that there were Wuhuan groups, who were part of the Donghu federation and followed Tuyühu Khan in the westward migration, would make the interpretation that &quot;Tangut&quot; represented &quot;the Donghu people&quot; stronger, not only from reflecting that the Wuhuan joined the Xianbei in the Tuyühu and Western Xia empires, but also contrasting that the Mongols had descended from the Xiongnu. If the Mongols had descended from the Xianbei, as the Chinese scholars characterized, the Mongols would have shared the same ethnic origins with the Xianbei of the Tuyühu Empire and not have called them as &quot;the Donghu people&quot; in reference of Western Xia. While the intimate associations between the two groups were manifested in the cross references of the Mongols as &quot;Mengwu Shiwei&quot; (or &quot;Mongol Xianbei&quot;) from the first century and the Monguor as &quot;Chaghan (or White) Monguor&quot; in the thirteenth century, ethnically and culturally they remained different. As much as the prefix &quot;Mengwu&quot; (or &quot;Mongol&quot;) in front of &quot;Shiwei&quot; (or &quot;Xianbei&quot;) marked the difference between the Mongols and the Xianbei, the prefix &quot;Chaghan&quot; in front of &quot;Monguor&quot; indicated that the Monguor and their Xianbei predecessors were not the same as the Mongols. Culturally, the Mongols have retained a nomadic lifestyle, whereas the social organizations and religious lives of the Monguor are of far greater complexities.

====Mongols, Khitans, and Jurchens====
When the Mongols emerged as a mighty power in the thirteenth century, a reverse occurred in the ethnonyms of the Xianbei and Mongols. This was represented in the reference of the Xianbei descendants as &quot;Chaghan Monguor&quot; (or &quot;White Mongols&quot;), which gave rise to the ethnonym of &quot;Monguor&quot; known in the Western publications. The term &quot;White Mongols,&quot; or &quot;Bai Menggu,&quot; first occurred when Genghis Khan united the Mongols to rise up in Mongolia in 1206. The Xianbei descendants who resided near Mt. Yin self-proclaimed to be &quot;White Mongols&quot; and joined them. They received the same treatment as the Mongols and partook in their westward conquests in Central Asia and Europe.

As waves and waves of the Xianbei went south and westward to establish different empires, those who remained in the northeast emerged as major powers later to rule over China. While the &quot;Mongol Xianbei&quot; (or &quot;Mengwu Shiwei&quot;) emerged from the northern Manchuria and northeastern Mongolia, the Khitans, or &quot;Qidan&quot; in Chinese, derived their ancestral origins from the Yuwen Xianbei in southern Mongolia, who had earlier founded the Western Wei (535–556) and Northern Zhou (557–581) of the Northern dynasties. When the Khitans established the Liao dynasty (916–1125) in China proper, they were referred to as &quot;Qara (or Black) Khitāy&quot;. Their rule gave rise to the reference of China known as &quot;Hătāi&quot; and &quot;Cathay&quot; in the Persian and European countries. The reference of &quot;Qara&quot; (or &quot;Black&quot;) as a prefix in the name of the Khitans and &quot;Khara&quot; (or &quot;Black&quot;) in that of the Mongols may indicate that both groups had substantial input from the Xiongnu, who by self proclaiming to be &quot;Xianbei&quot; earlier made it hard in distinguish in the Chinese records.

After the Xianbei vacated from the northeast, the Jurchens, known as &quot;Nüzhen&quot; in Chinese, moved southward into Manchuria from their original habitation in the Tungus Plains in eastern Russia located on the north of Manchuria. They occupied the former areas of the Xianbei and renamed the Xianbei Mountains (鮮卑山) to &quot;Daxinganling,&quot; which remains in use today and literally meant &quot;White Mountains&quot; in their Tungus language. They first established the Jin dynasty (1115–1234) in northern China by pushing the Liao Empire of the Khitans westward into Xinjiang. After the Jin Empire was destroyed by the Mongols in 1234, they withdrew back to Manchuria and returned later with the rejoined forces from the Mongols to establish the last dynasty of the Qing (1644–1912) in China under the new ethnonym of Manchu, or &quot;Man Zu&quot; in Chinese.

====Xia title====
The full national title of Western Xia was &quot;the Great Xia Kingdom of the White and Mighty,&quot; or &quot;Bai Gao Da Xia Guo&quot; (白高大夏国). The term &quot;White&quot; (or &quot;Bai&quot;) was designated to the founding ethnic group, the Xianbei descendants of the Tuyühu Empire, which is consistent with their reference of &quot;Chaghan&quot; (or &quot;White&quot;), derived from their origins from the Murong Xianbei known as the &quot;White Section.&quot; The term &quot;Mighty&quot; (or &quot;Gao&quot;) was designated to the &quot;Qiang&quot; people who formed the majority of the population. The &quot;Qiang&quot; were the native peoples who were subjugated by the Xianbei in the northwest. They initially rebelled but later their fate became intimately associated with the Xianbei, as they actively defended the empire when the enemies attacked. In addition to the Tibetans and authentic Han people, the &quot;Qiang&quot; comprised a portion of the Miao/Hmong who were relocated to the northwest from central China after their Three Miao Kingdom was destroyed by the legendary Chinese Emperor Yü the Great about four thousand years ago. The &quot;Qiang&quot; referred to Western Xia as their &quot;Gao (or ‘Mighty’) Mi Yao&quot; Kingdom. When &quot;Mi Yao&quot; is pronounced together, it is similar to &quot;Miao.&quot; Since the autonyms of the Miao/Hmong include &quot;Guoxiong&quot;, &quot;Gaoxiong,&quot; and &quot;Gouxiong,&quot; the character &quot;Gao&quot; (or &quot;Mighty&quot;) in the Xia national title could have derived as a variant abbreviation. &quot;Bai Gao&quot; in the national title was in turn used it to refer to the Yellow River, which had traditionally been referred to as the &quot;Mother River&quot; of China, known as &quot;Mu Qin He,&quot; that has nurtured their homeland.

===Current status===

The Flemish Catholic missionary, Schram, who wrote about the Monguor based on residence in the current Qinghai Province in the early twentieth century, cited Comte de Lesdain, who characterized the Monguor as &quot;the most authentic reminder of the primitive race from which the Chinese sprung.&quot; This characterization reflected that the Monguor culture under their observation has embodied &quot;a high civilization fortified by its own history and distinctive social structure&quot; developed by the Xianbei forefathers from their extensive rulings over China and preserved by the &quot;Monguor&quot;/&quot;Tu&quot;. As early as the Tuyühu period, Confucianism served as the core ideology to govern the country, and the Chinese Buddhism and Shamanism functioned as the principle religions. In Western Xia, Confucianism was further strengthened, and Taoism was made into the national religion along with Buddhism. As the Yellow Sect of Buddhism, also known as the Tibetan Buddhism, became prevalent in the northwest, their religious lives shifted from the Chinese toward Tibetan Buddhism. After Western Xia fell, its territory centered in Ningxia was fragmented by the successive establishments of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai provinces, which increasingly weakened the political and military powers of the Monguor. Through the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644–1912) dynasties, the Monguor continued to play important roles in the national defense, and political and religious affairs of China. Starting in the middle of the Ming dynasty, the ranches of the Monguor were taken into the state possession, and their horses became the subject of being drafted into the national army and looted by the Mongols from the north, resulting in the eventual shift of their lifestyles toward sedentary agriculture, supplemented by minimum animal husbandry, as the original Monguor groups became settled into the form of different villages. In the last two centuries, the areas formerly occupied by the Monguor were encroached upon by increasing inland Chinese migrations. Throughout this period, the Monguor maintained a high degree of political autonomy and self governance under the local chiefdom system of Tusi. The Monguor troops led by their Tusi defended not only their own homeland but also joined the national army to participate in wars that took place as far as in eastern Liaoning, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Yunnan, Mongolia, and Dunhuang, which progressively weakened their military power. Their political power came to the ultimate decline when the Tusi system was abolished in 1931, which exacerbated more Monguor to lose their language. By the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, only about fifty thousand of the Monguor have maintained to speak their language, primarily in Qinghai and Gansu. During the Chinese classificatory campaigns carried out in the 1950s, those who could no longer speak their language were classified into &quot;Han&quot;, those who could not speak their language but adopted the Islamic religion were classified into &quot;Hui&quot;, those who followed the Mongols into the northern grassland were classified into &quot;Mongols&quot;, and those who spoke their language and adopted the Islamic religion were classified into &quot;Dongxiang&quot;, &quot;Bonan&quot; and &quot;Yugur&quot;, the last of which represented the intermixture of the Xianbei and Sari Uyghurs.

==Culture==

Most Monguor in rapidly changing rural settlements today practice sedentary agriculture, supplemented by minimum animal husbandry, and seasonal work in towns and cities. Those who have succeeded in the Chinese educational system take up government jobs in a wide range of academic, medical, and business fields.

Traditional Monguor culture and language have become endangered. Traditional events like weddings, Nadun, funerals, and New Year rituals are increasingly abbreviated and traditional songs, riddles, folktales, and proverbs are vanishing.

===Religion===
In most villages, a Buddhist temple and a Taoist shrine coexist. Almost all the temples and shrines seen today have been rebuilt in the last three decades, since they were invariably destroyed during the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976). While Buddhist monks are common in most villages, Taoist priests and shamans have become very few and serve the whole area. The Taoist priests take charge of diverse functions that include weddings, funerals, and looking after the shrines, whereas the shaman&#x27;s primary function is to serve as a trance medium during the Nadun celebration and sometimes illness management. Local accounts indicated that there have been multiple Catholic churches constructed in the Monguor areas in the past. They were destroyed in the early 1950s after the Communists took control and have not been rebuilt.

===Nadun and Anzhao===
Distinctive cultural events take place throughout the year. Whereas the common festival held during the Spring Festival is &quot;Yangguo,&quot; the most characteristic tradition is represented by Nadun that takes place in the end of the summer. Nadun resembles Nadam of the Mongols in name but are different in format and content. Both &quot;Nadun&quot; and &quot;Nadam&quot; are special nouns designated to an annual festival and reflect their shared origins from the Xianbei who were recorded to have &quot;one major gathering every spring for leisure and fun by river&quot;. Whereas the Mongolian Nadam preserved the nomadic features of horse race, wrestling, and archery, the Monguor Nadun has encoded their history through masked dance performances and presents as an annual military drill combined with joyful celebrations of harvest. Held by villages in turn along the Yellow River and circles through the entire Sanchuan/Guanting region in Minhe, the Nadun festival is inherently tied to agricultural work. It functions as the Monguor form of &quot;Thanksgiving&quot; in the Western culture and expresses gratitude for an abundance of harvest blessed by Heaven referred to as &quot;Tiangere.&quot; The event lasts over two months, starting from the twelfth of the seventh month to the fifteenth of the ninth month by the Chinese lunar calendar, and spans for a total of 63 days, giving rise to its eponym as &quot;the world’s longest festival&quot;. Among the Huzhu Monguor, the characteristic traditional dance is &quot;Anzhao.&quot; Its name and styles bear resemblance to the &quot;Andai&quot; dance of the Mongols who live in Ordos, an area that has historically served as the transitional point for the Xianbei to move about in China.

===Wedding songs===
The traditional weddings of the Monguor differ markedly. In Minhe County, elaborate rules of courtesy and appropriateness were at work. Many songs &quot;daola&quot; were sung for days and nights with great variations in melody and contents. Wherever the Monguor go, they take their songs with them, which can be heard in parties, banquets, and at gatherings in cities where they work.

<doc id="330827" wikidata="Q917574" url="?curid=330827" title="Brioche">
<text>Brioche (, , , ) is a pastry of French origin whose high egg and butter content gives it a rich and tender crumb. The chef Joël Robuchon described it as &quot;light and slightly puffy, more or less fine, according to the proportion of butter and eggs&quot;. It has a dark, golden, and flaky crust, frequently accentuated by an egg wash applied after proofing.

Brioche is considered a &quot;Viennoiserie&quot; because it is made in the same basic way as bread but has the richer aspect of a pastry because of the addition of eggs, butter, liquid (milk, water, cream, and, sometimes, brandy) and occasionally sugar. Brioche, along with and &quot;pain aux raisins&quot;—which are commonly eaten at breakfast or as a snack—form a leavened subgroup of . Brioche is often baked with additions of fruit or chocolate chips and served on its own or as the basis of a dessert, with many regional variations in added ingredients, fillings, or toppings.

==Forms==
Brioche has numerous uses in cuisine and can take on various forms, served plain or filled, as coulibiac, or with many other different savory fillings, such as fillet of beef en croute, foie gras, sausage, or cervelat lyonnais. Brioche can also be served with sweet fillings, especially fresh fruits, vanilla cream, or jam. Stale brioche can be topped with frangipane to make .
 or is perhaps the most classically recognized form: it is formed and baked in a fluted round, flared tin; a large ball of dough is placed on the bottom and topped with a smaller ball of dough to form the head (). is a loaf of brioche made in a standard loaf pan. Instead of shaping two pieces of dough and baking them together, two rows of small pieces are placed in the pan. Loaves are then proofed (allowed to rise) in the pan, fusing the pieces. The dough balls rise further during the baking process and form an attractive pattern.

Brioche can also be made in a pan without being rolled into balls to make an ordinary loaf.

Brioche dough contains flour, eggs, butter, liquid (milk, water, cream, and sometimes brandy), leavening (yeast or sourdough), salt, and sometimes sugar. A common flour-to-butter ratio is 2:1, but historically, brioche of varying degrees of richness (from the &quot;rich man&#x27;s brioche&quot; with a flour-to-butter ratio of 3:2 to the cheaper with a ratio of 4:1) have existed at the same time. The Roux Brothers used a ratio of butter to flour.

The normal preparation method is to make the dough, let it rise to double its volume at room temperature, and then punch it down and let it rise again in the refrigerator for varying periods (according to the recipe), retarding the dough to develop the flavor. Refrigeration also stiffens the dough, which still rises, albeit slowly, making it easier to form. The dough is then shaped, placed in containers for the final proofing, and generally brushed on top with an egg wash before being baked at until the crust browns and the interior reaches at least . The first rise time for small rolls is 1 to 1½ hours; for larger brioche, the time is lengthened until the loaves double.

==History==

The first recorded use of the word in French dates from 1404. It is attested in 1611 in Cotgrave&#x27;s &quot;A Dictionarie of the French and English Tongues&quot;, where it is described as &quot;a , or , of spiced bread&quot; and its origin given as Norman.

In France, it developed as &quot;a sort of bread improved since antiquity by generations of bakers, then of pastry-makers ... with some butter, some eggs, sugar coming later ... it developed from the blessed bread [pain bénit] of the church which gradually became of better quality, more and more costly, less and less bread; until becoming savory brioche&quot;. In the 17th century &quot;&quot;, &quot; [poor] ... [using only] 3 eggs and 250 grams [8 oz] of butter for 1 kilogram [2 lb] of flour&quot; was introduced. The terms and were sometimes used together or virtually interchangeably; so, for example, in another 17th-century recipe entitled: &quot;CHAPITRE II. Pain bénit, &amp; brioches.&quot; It begins with a lighter, cheaper version of blessed bread, calling for &quot;a pound of fresh butter and a soft cheese [but no eggs!] for a pail of flour&quot;; and goes on to describe &quot;the more delicate that we call Cousin,&quot; which uses 3 pounds of butter, two kinds of cheese, and a royal pint of eggs for the same amount of flour, as well as &quot;some good milk&quot; if &quot;the dough is too firm.&quot; However, sourdough and brewer&#x27;s yeast preparations would both remain common well into the next century, with &quot;blessed bread ... more and more often replaced by brioche&quot; in the 18th century, where &quot;Those from Gisors and Gournay, great butter markets, were the most highly regarded.&quot;

For the wealthy &quot;from the time of Louis XIV onwards ... Butter, in widespread use at least in the northern half of France, was the secret of making &quot;brioches&quot;&quot;. &quot;In Gisors, on market days, they produce up to 250 or 300 kg [550 or 650 lb] of brioches. The dough is made the evening before (1 kg [2 lb] of farine, a quarter of which for the starter, 10 g [⅓ oz] of yeast, 7 or 8 eggs; one mixes this with the starter and 800 g [28 oz] of butter, breaking up the dough, which &#x27;uses up the butter&#x27;). The dough is kept in a terrine, and one puts it in a mold just at the moment of baking. Thus prepared, the brioche remains light, keeps well, maintains the flavour of butter, without the stench of the starter.&quot;

Jean-Jacques Rousseau, in his autobiography &quot;Confessions&quot;, relates that &quot;a great princess&quot; is said to have advised, with regard to peasants who had no bread, &quot;&quot;, commonly translated as &quot;Let them eat cake.&quot; This saying is commonly misattributed to Queen Marie-Antoinette, wife of Louis XVI.

==Etymology==
Although there has been much debate about the etymology of the word and, thus, the recipe&#x27;s origins, it is now widely accepted that it is derived from the Old French verb , a Norman dialectical form of , to work the dough with a or (a sort of wooden roller for kneading); the suffix is a generic deverbal suffix. &quot;Pain brié&quot; is a Norman bread whose dense dough was formerly worked with this instrument. The word is of Germanic origin, probably derived from the Proto-Indo-European root ().

<doc id="330829" wikidata="Q1808542" url="?curid=330829" title="National Amusements">
<text>National Amusements, Inc. is an American privately owned movie theater operator and mass media holding company incorporated in Maryland and based in Norwood, Massachusetts. The company owns 71 theaters and 689 screens throughout the United States, the United Kingdom, and Latin America under several brands, such as Showcase Cinemas, Multiplex Cinemas, and Cinema de Lux. It is the controlling shareholder of Paramount Global.

National Amusements was founded by Michael Redstone, and later passed to his son Sumner Redstone. After his 2020 death, the company was passed to a trust led by his daughter Shari Redstone. After nearly 90 years of control by the Redstone family, in July 2024, David Ellison&#x27;s Skydance Media announced its intent to acquire National Amusements and perform an three-way merger between it, National Amusements and Paramount Global to form &quot;Paramount Skydance Corporation.&quot;

== History ==

The company was founded by Michael Redstone in 1936 in the Boston suburb of Dedham as Northeast Theater Corporation, operating a chain of movie theaters in the region. In 1959, when the founder&#x27;s son Sumner Redstone joined the company, it was renamed National Amusements, the present name. 

On June 10, 1987, the company became the majority owner of the original incarnation of Viacom, a former CBS subsidiary syndicating television programs to stations around the United States. Since the buyout, Viacom continued to expand through purchases from the early 1990s to the early 2000s, announcing plans to merge with Paramount Communications (formerly Gulf+Western), parent of Paramount Pictures, in 1993 (which closed in 1994), buying the Blockbuster Video chain in 1994, merging with the original CBS Corporation in 2000, and acquiring BET Holdings (which became BET Media Group) in 2001.

In March 2005, due to Viacom&#x27;s declining stock price, National Amusements announced that it would split its media subsidiary into two companies that would remain under its control, which was completed on December 31. The original Viacom became the second CBS Corporation as it kept CBS, Simon &amp; Schuster, and Paramount Network Television (now CBS Studios), among other assets, while MTV Networks, BET Media Group, and Paramount Pictures were spun-off to a sister company under the Viacom name. The second iterations of Viacom and CBS Corporation commenced trading on January 3, 2006.

At the end of 2008, due to financial troubles, owners Sumner Redstone and Shari Redstone sold $400 million of nonvoting shares in National Amusements. In October 2009, the company sold almost $1 billion of its interest in the stock of CBS and Viacom and sold 35 theaters to Rave Motion Pictures. Today these theatres are owned by Cinemark, AMC, Alamo, or have closed. National Amusements now almost exclusively operates theaters in the Northeastern United States (with the exception of one location in Ohio). The following year, National Amusements planned to sell $390 million of notes to refinance a large part of the company&#x27;s bank owed debt.

In 2019, it was announced that the multinational media conglomerates controlled by National Amusements — Viacom and CBS Corporation — would re-merge to form a new company named ViacomCBS. Viacom and CBS announced that the merger would close on December 4; following the official close, the company began trading on the NASDAQ the following day. In 2022, the company was renamed Paramount Global.

Sumner Redstone, who was National Amusements&#x27; chairman, CEO and owner, died on August 11, 2020. His holdings were transferred to a trust led by his daughter Shari Redstone.

In January 2024, it was reported that film producer David Ellison was interested in buying National Amusements from the Redstones. If the acquisition would be closed, the company would be placed under Ellison&#x27;s Skydance Media. On July 2, it was reported that Skydance had reached a preliminary agreement, and that it had been referred to a special committee of Paramount&#x27;s board for approval. On July 7, Skydance officially announced its intent to acquire Paramount Global, under a process in which Skydance will acquire National Amusements for $2.4 billion, pay Paramount&#x27;s Class A and Class B stockholders $4.5 billion in cash and shares, and then perform an all-stock merger between Paramount and Skydance.

== Current operations ==
The company operates more than 1,500 movie screens across the Northeastern United States, the United Kingdom, and Latin America under its Showcase Cinemas, Showcase Cinema de Lux, Multiplex Cinemas, and Cinema de Lux. In Canada, National Amusements, through its 1994 acquisition of Viacom, also owned Famous Players; individual cinemas from the now-defunct chain are now owned by Cineplex Entertainment and Landmark Cinemas. In 2004, National Amusements acquired the Brazilian operations to cinema chain UCI, and revamped them so they could be more in line with their Showcase chain. They also share some of the corporate identities of Showcase and have XPlus &amp; De Lux rooms in selected cinemas, as well as fully reclining seats. 

National Amusements owns a 9.7% equity stake and 79.9% voting interest in Paramount Global, and used to operate its predecessors, the second CBS Corporation and the second Viacom before their closure in 2019, both split from the also defunct First Viacom. The company may hold an unspecified stake in Audacy, Inc., as part of the reverse Morris trust that spun CBS&#x27;s radio assets off to that company; CBS Corporation shareholders overall held a 72% stake in the then-named Entercom as of the spin-off.

<doc id="330831" wikidata="Q868044" url="?curid=330831" title="Mulao people">
<text>The Mulao people (; own name: Mulam) are an ethnic group. They form one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by the People&#x27;s Republic of China. In their name, &quot;Mulam&quot;, &quot;mu&quot;6 is a classifier for human beings and &quot;lam&quot;1 (in some dialects it is &quot;kyam&quot;1) is another form of the name used by the Dong (&quot;Kam&quot;), to whom the Mulao people are ethnically related. A large portion of the Mulao in Guangxi live in Luocheng Mulao Autonomous County of Hechi, Guangxi, China. As of the 2010 Chinese Census, there are 216,257 Mulao people in China, comprising about 0.016% of China&#x27;s total population.

==History==
It is believed that the Mulao are the descendants of the ancient &quot;Ling&quot; and &quot;Liao&quot; tribes that inhabited the region during the time of the Jin Dynasty. During the Yuan dynasty, the Mulao lived in a feudal society and they paid a series of tributes twice a year to the emperor.

During the Qing Dynasty, their territories suffered an administrative division; their lands were divided into &quot;dongs&quot;, which were composed of units for 10 dwellings. Each &quot;dong&quot; had its own local leader, responsible for maintaining the order and of collecting the taxes. Each &quot;dong&quot; was generally formed by families that shared the same surname.

Qiongying Deng and Chuan-Chao Wang et al. have reported that most of the patrilineal and matrilineal gene pools of Mulao are characteristic lineages of Southern China. Some ancient Southeast Asian lineages (Y chromosome haplogroups C and D, mtDNA haplogroups M*, M33, M74 and R*) were also identified in Mulao. Mulao shows patterns of the Y chromosome and mtDNA diversities similar to other southern populations, especially Kam-Sui populations, which was actually in accordance with linguistic classification. However, the origin of Mulao seems to be much more complex. Recent gene flow from Sino-Tibetan populations is detected in the patrilineal side of Mulao, such as Y chromosome haplogroups O3a1c-002611, O3a2c1*-M134 and O3a2c1a-M117, probably through the expansion and dispersal of Han Chinese. From the matrilineal aspect, most mtDNA haplogroups of Mulao also clustered together with Hmong-Mien. Taken together, the origin of Mulao are mainly results of an admixture between surrounding populations with the indigenous Kam-Sui populations.

The Mulao population of China has been increasing in the 21st century, growing from 207,352 in 2000 to 216,257 in 2010.

== Demographics ==
According to the 2010 Chinese Census, of the 216,257 Mulao people living in China, 17,640 (8.16%) are 4 years old or younger, 13,879 (6.42%) are 5 to 9 years old, 13,842 (6.40%) are 10 to 14 years old, 15,653 (7.24%) are 15 to 19 years old, 22,221 (10.28%) are 20 to 24 years old, 21,190 (9.80%) are 25 to 29 years old, 17,868 (8.26%) are 30 to 35 years old, 18,320 (8.47%) are 35 to 39 years old, 17,989 (8.32%) are 40 to 44 years old, 14,747 (6.82%) are 45 to 49 years old, 9,496 (4.39%) are 50 to 54 years old, 10,053 (4.65%) are 55 to 59 years old, 6,950 (3.21%) are 60 to 64 years old, 5,489 (2.54%) are 65 to 69 years old, 4,694 (2.17%) are 70 to 74 years old, 3,341 (1.54%) are 75 to 79 years old, 1,845 (0.85%) are 80 to 84 years old, 716 (0.33%) are 85 to 89 years old, 230 (0.11%) are 90 to 94 years old, 82 (0.04%) are 95 to 99 years old, and 12 (0.01%) are 100 years old or older.

=== Distribution ===
According to the 2010 Chinese Census, there are 216,257 Mulao people living within China, a majority of which live in Guangxi. Per the census, there are 110,516 Mulao males and 105,741 females. The Mulao people remain fairly rural, with 95,703 Chinese Mulao living in urban areas as of 2010, and 120,554 living in rural areas.
==Language==
The Mulao speak the Mulam language, a Tai–Kadai language that uses Hanzi (Chinese characters) when written.

==Culture==

Traditionally, the marriages among the Mulao were arranged by the parents and traditionally, new wives did not live together with their new husbands until the birth of their first son.

Their homes are made out of clay with brick roofs and are composed of three rooms. The animals are maintained far away of the family dwellings.

The traditional clothing of the men consists of a jacket of large buttons, wide pants and sandals. The single women arranged their hair into two tresses that become a tuft when they are married.

==Religion==

Although religion no longer plays a significant role in their daily life, traditionally the Mulao have been mostly animists. Each month they would celebrate diverse festivals. The most important one of these was the festival &quot;Yifan&quot;, where diverse sacrifices of animals were carried out.

Another one of their festivals was the dragon boat festival that was celebrated on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month. During this celebration, the shamans carried out ceremonies to assure good crop harvests and to expel harmful insects.

<text>The Daur people, Dagur, Daghur or Dahur (Dagur:Daure; Khalkha Mongolian: , ; ; Russian: Дауры, Daury) are a Mongolic people originally native to Dauria and now predominantly located in Northeast China (and Siberia, Russia, in the past). The Daur form one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognised in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. They numbered 131,992 according to the latest census (2010) and most of them live in Morin Dawa Daur Autonomous Banner in Hulun Buir, northeastern Inner Mongolia and Meilisi Daur District in Qiqihar, Heilongjiang, Northeast China. Some Daur people also live near Tacheng in Xinjiang.

== Language ==

The Dagur language is a Mongolic language. There is a Latin-based orthography which has been devised by a native Daur scholar.
The Dagur language retains some Khitan substratal features, including a number of lexemes not found in other Mongolic languages. It is made up of three dialects: Batgan, Hailar, Qiqihar.

During Qing rule, some Daur spoke and wrote Manchu as a second language.

== History ==

Genetically, the Daurs are descendants of the Khitan In the Qianlong Emperor&#x27;s &quot;钦定《辽金元三史语解》&quot; (Imperially commissioned Translations of the History of Liao, History of Jin and History of Yuan) he retranslates &quot;大贺&quot;, a Khitan clan described in the History of Liao, as &quot;达呼尔&quot;. That is the earliest theory that claims Daurs are descendants of Khitans.

In the 17th century, some or all of the Daurs lived along the Shilka, upper Amur, on the Zeya and Bureya River. They thus gave their name to the region of Dauria.

By the mid-17th century, the Amur Daurs fell under the influence of the Manchus of the Qing dynasty which crushed the resistance of Bombogor, leader of the Evenk-Daur Federation in 1640. When the Russian explorers and raiders arrived to the region in the early 1650 (notably, during Yerofei Khabarov&#x27;s 1651 raid), they would often see the Daur farmers burn their smaller villages and taking refuge in larger towns. When told by the Russians to submit to the rule of the Tsar and to pay &quot;yasak&quot; (tribute), the Daurs would often refuse, saying that they already paid tribute to the Shunzhi Emperor (whose name the Russians recorded from the Daurs as &quot;Shamshakan&quot;). The Cossacks would then attack, usually being able to take Daur towns with only small losses. For example, Khabarov reported that in 1651 he had only 4 of his Cossacks killed while storming the town of the Daur prince Guigudar (Гуйгударов городок) (another 45 Cossacks were wounded, but all were able to recover). Meanwhile, the Cossacks reported killing 661 &quot;Daurs big and small&quot; at that town (of which, 427 during the storm itself), and taking 243 women and 118 children prisoners, as well as capturing 237 horse and 113 cattle. The captured Daur town of Yaxa became the Russian town Albazin, which was not recaptured by the Qing until the 1680s.

Cattle and horses in the hundreds were looted and 243 ethnic Daur girls and women were raped by Russian Cossacks under Yerofey Khabarov when he invaded the Amur river basin in the 1650s.

Facing the Russian expansion in the Amur region, between 1654 and 1656, during the reign of Shunzhi Emperor, the Daurs were forced to move southward and settle on the banks of the Nen River, from where they were constantly conscripted to serve in the banner system of the Qing emperors.

Russian Cossack soldiers slaughtered 1,266 households, 900 Daurs during the Blagoveshchensk massacre and Sixty-Four Villages East of the River massacre. 

When the Japanese invaded the area of present-day Morin Dawa in Inner Mongolia in 1931, the Daurs carried out an intense resistance against them.

Konan Naito pointed out that Takri Kingdom where King Dongmyeong, a founder of Buyeo was born, as a country of Daur people who lived by Songhua River.

== Culture ==
There is a very noticeable hierarchic structure. People sharing the same surname are in groups called &quot;hala&quot;, they live together with the same group, formed by two or three towns. Each &quot;hala&quot; is divided in diverse clans (&quot;mokon&quot;) that live in the same town. If a marriage between different clans is made, the husband continues to live with the clan of his wife without holding property rights.

During the winter, the Daur women wear long dresses, generally blue in color and boots of skin which they change for long trousers in summer. The men dress in orejeros caps in fox or red deer skin made for winter. In the summer, they cover the animal&#x27;s head with white colored fabrics or straw hats.

A customary sport of the Daur is Beikou, a game similar to field hockey or street hockey, which has been played by the Daur for about 1,000 years.

== Religion ==
Many Daurs practice shamanism. Each clan has its own shaman in charge of all the important ceremonies in the lives of the Daur. However, there are a significant number of Daurs who have taken up Tibetan Buddhism.

During the Qing, the Daur knew a version of the &quot;Tale of the Nisan Shaman&quot;, in which the female shaman Ny Dan competed against her rivals at the Qing court, the Tibetan monks who managed to convince the Qing emperor to execute her. The Qing emperor is shown as a fool who is tricked by the lamas.

<text>The Jingpo people (; ; &quot;siŋphou&quot;) are a Southeast Asian Tibeto-Burman ethnic group who are the largest subgroup of the Kachin peoples. The greater name for all the Kachin peoples in their own Jingpo language is the &quot;Jinghpaw&quot;. Other endonyms include Zaiwa, Lechi, Lisu, Maru, Hkahku, etc.
The Kachin people are an ethnic affinity of several tribal groups, known for their fierce independence, disciplined fighting skills, complex clan inter-relations, craftsmanship, herbal healing and jungle survival skills. Other neighbouring residents of Kachin State include the Nagas, Shans (Thai/Lao related), the Lisus, the Rawangs, and the Bamar, the latter forming the largest ethnic group in Burma. In China, the Jingpo form one of the 55 ethnic minorities where they numbered 147,828 people in the 2010 census.

==Distribution==

The Jingpo largely inhabit the Kachin Hills in northern Myanmar&#x27;s Kachin State and neighbouring Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture of China.

Although the majority live in Myanmar, there is also a significant Jingpo community in the states of Arunachal Pradesh and Assam in northeast India as well as a community of 100 to 200 in Taiwan. The Kachin are called the &quot;Jingpo&quot; in China () and Singpho in Indiathe terms are considered synonymous.

==Scope==
There are three different official definitions of Jingpo people:

# The Jinghpo ethnic group refers to those who speak Jingpo as their sole mother tongue;. This is the definition adopted by the government of Myanmar, who consider the Jinghpo one of the country&#x27;s 135 officially recognized ethnic groups. 
# The Jingpo Nation or Jinghpo Pongyong also includes all speakers of varieties belonging to the Zaiwa cluster of Northern Burmish languages, who speak Jingpo as their secondary language. This is the definition adopted by the PRC government who consider the Jingpo Nation one of the 56 officially recognized nations of China. 
# The Jingpo Confederation or Jinghpo Wunpong emerged in the twentieth century and refers to a grouping of six ethnicities: the two mentioned above plus the Rawang, the Lisu, the Lashi/Lachik and the Lawngwaw/Maru. This is the definition adopted by the Burmese government as one of the 8 &quot;major national ethnic races&quot; of Myanmar.

=== In Myanmar ===
The Kachins claim that the term Kachin is not from their language. Therefore, many only want to use the term &quot;Jinghpaw Wunpawng&quot; to mean all ethnic Kachin while &quot;Jinghpaw&quot; is also used not only to mean one of the Kachin tribe &quot;Jinghpaw&quot;, but also to include all the Kachins. Two different categorisation schemes complicate the terms Jingpo and Kachin, which also operate as political geography terms of British origin.

In one form of categorisation, a variety of different linguistic groups with overlapping territories and integrated social structures are described as a single people: the Jingpo or Kachin. In another form of categorisation, the native speakers of each language in the area are treated as distinct ethnic groups. Both schemes treat the Shan people who live in the same or contiguous areas as ethnically distinct. Jingpo people have frequently defied the Western expectation of lineage-based ethnicity by culturally &quot;becoming Shans&quot; (Leach 1965).

Just recently the Burmese Government announced that family records for all citizens will categorise each people according to dialect. As a result, many have become confused what to choose to be named on their IDs. The Kachins are divided and fighting over the name Kachin or Jinghpaw Wunpawng even though there is clear and vivid evidence that they all are from the same background with the closest identities. Despite the fact that all syntax, grammar, phonology, morphology, schools of thought, traditions, and culture are all the same while pronunciation, spellings, and alphabets differ (which is natural for different tribes within the same ethnic group), Kachins are divided and debating the terms Kachin and Jinghpaw Wunpawng.

===Jingpo===
Jingpo proper (spelled &quot;Jinghpaw&quot; in Jinghpaw) is spoken by 1,500,000 people in Burma and by 150,000 people in China. It is classified as Sino-Tibetan, Tibeto-Burman, Kachin–Luic. Jingpo proper is also understood by many speakers of Zaiwa. The standard Jingpo language taught in China is based on the dialect of Enkun (in Yingjiang – west-northwest part of Dehong Prefecture).
There are around 100–200 Jingpo people who live in Taiwan: they can be found in Taipei, Kaohsiung, Pingtung, Taitung, and other cities. They are the descendants of 52 tribespeople who were members of the Yunnan People&#x27;s Anti-Communist Volunteer Army who fled to Taiwan after the defeat of the Kuomintang in Mainland China. Every October, they host performances where they dance in traditional costumes. There is also a &quot;Jingpo Taiwanese Friendship Association&quot;.

===Zaiwa===

Zaiwa (also spelled &quot;Tsaiwa&quot;; called &quot;Atsi&quot; in Jingpo proper, &quot;Zǎiwǎyǔ&quot; (载瓦语) in Chinese, and &quot;Zi&quot; in Burmese) is spoken by approximately 80,000 people in China and 30,000 people in Burma. It is classified as Sino-Tibetan, Tibeto-Burman, Yi-Burman, and Northern Burmic. After the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, a written language based on the dialect of the village of Longzhun (in Xishan district in Luxi county) and using the Latin alphabet was created and officially introduced in 1957.

==Religion==
Jingpo folk religion worships various gods as well as the spirits of their ancestors. The ancestor of all the Jingpo, who is worshipped as a spirit or god, is held to be named Madai. Jingpo Animists believe that spirits reside everywhere, from the sun to the animals, and that these spirits bring good or bad luck. For the Jingpo, all living creatures are believed to have souls. Rituals are carried out for protection in almost all daily activities, from planting of crops to warfare.

The majority of Singphos in India follow Theravāda Buddhism. Christianity is also one of the religions among the Jingpo. Around 90% of the Jingpo people in Myanmar follow Christianity, while the remaining 10% are Animists or Theravada Buddhist.

==Culture==
Traditional Jingpo dwellings are usually two stories and built out of wood and bamboo. The houses are of oval form; the first floor serves as a storage and stable while the second is utilised for living quarters. Women often dress in black jackets with silver decorations. They also wear wool skirts made in bright colours. The men often wear white and black pants, covering their heads with turbans: the youths with white turbans and the adults with black turbans.

==History==
The Jingpo ancestors lived on the Tibetan plateau and migrated gradually towards the south. At their arrival to the present province of Yunnan, the Jingpo were referred to as &quot;Xunchuanman&quot;. The Jingpo are likely related to the neighbouring Qiang and Miao people.

The Jinghpo polity in Upper Myanmar was recognized as a tusi by the Chinese Ming dynasty and is referred to as Cha-shan in the Chinese chronicle &quot;Ming Shilu&quot;. In the text, the polity is said to extend from Nmai River in today&#x27;s Kachin state, Myanmar, to the east in Lu-shui county in Yunnan.
During the 15th and 16th centuries the Jingpo continued migrating to their present territory. During the 17th century, the Jinphos were involved in trade exchange between the Ahom kingdom and China in the form of ivory, copper and silver. They have received diverse names along the centuries: &quot;Echang&quot;, &quot;Zhexie&quot;, and &quot;Yeren&quot;, the latter name which was used in China from the Yuan dynasty to the formation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949. During the British colonial period, some tribes were well integrated into the state while others operated with a large degree of autonomy. Kachin people, including those organised as the Kachin Levies provided assistance to British units fighting the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II.

Following the end of World War II and Burma&#x27;s independence from Britain, long standing ethnic conflicts between frontier peoples such as the Kachin people and the Burman-dominated central government resurfaced. The first uprising occurred in 1949. The uprisings escalated following the declaration of Buddhism (which is not practised by the Kachin people) as a national religion in 1961. However, Kachin people fought both for and against the government during most of the ethnic conflicts. Kachin soldiers once formed a core part of the Burmese armed forces and many stayed loyal after the Kachin Independence Organisation (KIO) with its military wing, the Kachin Independent Army (KIA) was formed in 1961. After Ne Win&#x27;s coup in 1962, there were fewer opportunities in the Burma Army for Kachin people. Much of Kachin State outside of the cities and larger towns was for many years KIO administered.

The KIO formed alliances with other ethnic groups resisting the Burmese occupation, and later despite its non-communist stance along with China informally supported the Communist Party of Burma (CPB), which held strategically sensitive parts of the country vis à vis the Kachin positions. The KIO continued to fight when Ne Win&#x27;s dictatorship was succeeded by another incarnation of the military junta in 1988 called the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC). However, with a gradual withdrawal of Chinese support, in 1989 the Communist Party of Burma soon disintegrated into warlord led groups that negotiated ceasefire deals with the junta. This led to the KIO being surrounded by organisations effectively aligned with the SPDC. It was squeezed by redeployed battalions of the rearmed and ever growing Burma Army, and constantly urged to make peace by a civilian population suffering from years of warfare. In 1994 the KIO chose to enter into a ceasefire with the junta.

The ceasefire delivered neither security nor prosperity to the Kachin. With the end of hostilities the Burma Army presence has increased considerably, along with allegations of atrocities against the civilian population, including forced labour and rape.

High demand from China is currently encouraging logging-based deforestation in the Kachin region of Burma. Increasingly impoverished, some Jingpo women and children are drawn into the sex trade in Thailand, China and Yangon (KWAT 2005).

===Migration===
The Jinghpaws, or The Jinghpaw Wunpawngs, have been forced to migrate to Malaysia and Thailand. The civil war between KIA and the Burmese Army caused Kachins to leave their motherland and seek asylum in Thailand and Malaysia. Since both Thailand nor Malaysia are not signatories to the 1951 Geneva Refugee Convention, these two countries are just a second place for the Kachin refugees and they have to go to third countries such as the USA, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and other EU countries through UNHCR&#x27;s resettlement program. Since there are too many refugees in Malaysia to process their resettlement process, refugees normally have to wait for five to seven years to be resettled. Most of the Kachin refugees are in IDP camps and some are in Malaysia.

==Singpho people==
The Singpho is the name for the Jingpo in India. They live in the state of Arunachal Pradesh in the district of Lohit and Changlang and in Assam inhabits in the district of Tinsukia and scattered in some other district like Sivasagar, Jorhat and Golaghat. Comprising a population of at least 7,900 in India, they live in the villages, namely Bordumsa, Miao, Innao, N-hpum, Namgo, Ketetong, Pangna, Phup, N-htem, Mungong, Kumchai, Pangsun, Hasak, Katha, Bisa, Dibong, Duwarmara, Namo and Namsai, etc. They speak the Singpho dialect of the Jingpo language. They have the status of Scheduled Tribe.

The Singphos are divided into a number of clans, known as Gams, each under a chief. The principal Gams include the Bessa, Duffa, Luttao, Luttora, Tesari, Mirip, Lophae, Lutong and Magrong. The Singpho are also divided into four classes, namely Shangai, Myung, Lubrung and Mirip.

=== Religion ===
While the Singphos in India are predominantly Theravāda Buddhists, the Jinghpaws in Kachin, Myanmar is 99% Christian. Before the arrival of Buddhism, animism was widely followed; in this community in India, all the ancestors of the Singpho or Jinghpaws worshiped spirits or gods, such as a well-known spirit named Madai. Singpho Animists believe that spirits reside everywhere, from the sun to the animals, and that these spirits bring good or bad luck. For the Singpho, all living creatures are believed to have souls. Rituals are carried out for protection in almost all daily activities, from the planting of crops to warfare.

=== Lifestyle ===
Unlike most hill-people, shifting cultivation (jhum) is not as widely practiced, although tea is widely planted. When British attempts to introduce Chinese tea plants for cultivation in Assam were unsuccessful, they discovered that the Singpho people cultivated tea. By hybridizing the Singpho and Chinese strains, and using Chinese tea cultivation techniques, the basis for large-scale tea cultivation in Assam was laid. The Singpho produce their tea by plucking the tender leaves and drying them in the sun and exposing them to the night dew for three days and nights. The leaves are then placed in the hollow tube of bamboo, and the cylinder will be exposed to the smoke of the fire. In this way, their tea can be kept for years without losing its flavor. The Singpho also depended on yams and other edible tubers as their staple food.

They are the earliest people to have used tea in India, but there is no substantial documentation of the history of tea drinking in the Indian subcontinent for the pre-colonial period. One can only speculate that tea leaves were widely used in ancient India since the plant is native to some parts of India. The Singpho tribe and the Khamti tribe, inhabitants of the regions where the &quot;Camellia sinensis&quot; plant grew native, have been consuming tea since the 12th century. It is also possible that tea may have been used under another name. Frederick R. Dannaway, in the essay &quot;Tea As Soma&quot;, argues that tea was perhaps better known as &quot;Soma&quot; in Indian mythology.

=== Dress ===
The Singpho made shields from buffalo hide, many of them can be as long as four feet. They also have helmets are made from either buffalo hide or rattan-work, and vanished black and decorated with the boar&#x27;s tusks. Most men tie their hair in a large knot on the crown of the head. The women dress their hair gathered into a broad knot on the crown of the head, fastening it by silver bodkins, chains and tassels, which is similar to the architecture of the modern skyscrapers. The maidens tie their tresses into a roll and keep it tied just above the nape.
Singpho dwellings are usually two stories and built out of wood and bamboo. The houses are of oval form; the first floor serves as a storage and stable while the second is utilized for living quarters. Women often dress in black jackets with silver decorations during festival known as Munao Poi. This dress are one of the most beautiful and attractive dress in Northeast India. They also wear wool skirts made in bright red colors. The men often wear a white shirt with colorful Lungi, covering their heads with turbans.

<text>The Salar people are a Turkic ethnic minority in China who speak Salar, a Turkic language of the Oghuz sub-branch. They numbered 165,159 people in 2020, according to that year&#x27;s national census.

The Salars live mostly in the Qinghai–Gansu border region, on both sides of the Yellow River, namely in Xunhua Salar Autonomous County and Hualong Hui Autonomous County of Qinghai and the adjacent Jishishan Bonan, Dongxiang and Salar Autonomous County of Gansu. There are also Salars in some parts of Henan and Shanxi, as well as in northern Xinjiang, in the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture. They are a patriarchal agricultural society and predominantly Muslim.

==History==
===Origin===
According to Salar tradition and Chinese chronicles, the Salars are the descendants of the Salur tribe, belonging to the Oghuz Turk tribe of the Western Turkic Khaganate. During the Tang dynasty, the Salur tribe moved within China&#x27;s borders and have lived since then in the Qinghai-Gansu border region. Over the centuries, they mixed with neighboring Tibetans, Hui, Han Chinese and Dongxiangs, developing the distinctive modern Salar language and culture.

====Islamic legend====
According to a legend, two brothers named Haraman and Ahman, possibly forefathers of the present day Salar tribe, lived in the Samarkand area. They were highly ranked at local Islamic mosques, which led to persecution from local rulers. The two brothers fled along with eighteen members of the tribe on a white camel with water, soil and a Quran before heading east. The group trekked through the northern route of the Tian Shan range into the Jiayu Pass, passing through what is now Gansu (Jiuquan, Ganzhou, Zhangye; Ningxia, Qinzhou, Tianshui, and Gangu County), eventually stopping at the present Xiahe County. Later, another forty people from Samarkand joined the group. The group passed through the southern route of the Tian Shan and entered Qinghai. They arrived at the present Guide County and twelve of them settled there.

The Quran the two brothers brought on their journey to China is to this day still preserved in Xunhua Salar Autonomous County at Jiezi Grand Mosque in Haidong, Qinghai The Nanjing Museum has repaired the Quran to protect it from decaying.

===Ming dynasty===
The Salar clan leaders voluntarily capitulated to the Ming dynasty around 1370. The chief of the four upper clans around this time was Han Baoyuan and the Ming government granted him office of centurion, it was at this time the people of his four clans took Han as their surname. The other chief, Han Shanba, of the four lower Salar clans got the same office from the Ming government and his clans were the ones who took Ma as their surname. The ethnogenesis of the Salar started from when they pledged allegiance to the Ming dynasty under their leader Han Bao. Han Bao&#x27;s father was Omar and Omar&#x27;s father was Haraman, who led the Salars on their journey from Central Asia to China.

According to Salar oral history, Tibetan women were the original wives of the first Salars to arrive in the Qinghai region. Supposedly, they were only permitted to marry the women after a compromise between the Tibetan ruler of Wimdo Valley and the newcomers. He demanded that the Salars install prayer flags, which are a Tibetan Buddhist practice, on the four corners of their homes, that they pray with prayer wheels with mantras on them, and to bow before statues of Buddhas. The Salars initially refused the demands based on their religion but eventually compromised on the flags by placing stones on the corners of their houses instead, which is still practiced to this day. For this reason, Salars are often bilingual in Amdo Tibetan and the two groups often use the term &quot;maternal uncle&quot; to refer each other, referencing the Salars&#x27; Tibetan ancestry. Many Salar customs and practices have been influenced by Tibetan culture and there are numerous Tibetan loanwords in the Salar language.

In eastern Qinghai and Gansu, there were cases of Tibetan women who remained Buddhists while marrying Hui men; they had sons who would be Buddhist or Muslim. The Buddhist sons became lamas while the other sons were Muslims. The Kargan Tibetans, who live next to the Salar, have mostly become Muslim due to their influence.

Hui and Salar often intermarry due to their cultural similarities and shared religion, especially after the Ming Dynasty established control over the Xunhua Salars in 1370 and gave control to Hezhou officials. Many Hezhou Hui began to migrate to the region afterwards On the other hand, there are comparatively few Han-Salar marriages. The Salars do use Han surnames, however. Compared to Salar men, few Salar women married outside; the sole exception is Hui men taking Salar women as their wives while Tibetan women make up the majority of the spouses of Salar men who marry outside their ethnicity and it has been reported that Salars have a total avoidance of marriages with Han. As a result, Salars are heavily mixed with other ethnicities.

Salars in Qinghai live on both the northern and southern banks of the Yellow River; northern Salars are called Hualong or Bayan Salars while southern Salars are called Xunhua Salars. The northern region is a mix between discontinuous Salar and Tibetan villages while the southern region is more solidly Salar, as the Hui and Salars pushed out the Tibetans prior.

After moving in, the Salars originally practiced the same Gedimu variant of Sunni Islam as the Hui did and adopted Hui practices, such as Hui Islamic educational practices, which were derived from Yuan Dynasty era Arabic and Persian primers. One such Salar primer was called the &quot;Book of Diverse Studies&quot; (雜學本本).

Salars were often multilingual, having knowledge of Salar, Mongol, Chinese, Tibetan due to historically trading on the Yellow River in Ningxia and Lanzhou in Gansu. The Salars were permitted an enormous amount of autonomy and self-rule by the Ming dynasty, which gave them command of taxes, military and the courts. The Ming and Qing dynasties often mobilized Salars into their militaries as soldiers, with the Ming government recruiting them at 17 different times for service and the Qing government at 5 different times.

===Qing dynasty===
The Kangxi Emperor incited anti-Muslim sentiment among the Mongols of Qinghai in order to gain support against the Dzungar Oirat Mongol leader Galdan. Kangxi claimed that Chinese Muslims inside China, such as Turkic Muslims in Qinghai, were plotting with Galdan, who he claimed had turned his back on Buddhism and the Dalai Lama in favor of Islam. According to Kangxi, Galdan was plotting to invade in conspiracy with Chinese Muslims and wished to install a Muslim as ruler of China.

In the 1670s, the Kashgarian Sufi master Āfāq Khoja (and possibly his father Muhammad Yūsuf) preached to the Salars and introduced Sufism into their community. In the mid-18th century, one of Āfāq Khoja&#x27;s spiritual descendants, Ma Laichi, began to spread his teachings, known as Khufiyya among the Salars, as well among their Chinese-speaking and Tibetan-speaking neighbors.

Throughout the 1760s and 1770s, another Chinese Sufi master, Ma Mingxin, was spreading his version of Sufi teaching, known as Jahriyya throughout the Gansu province (which then included Salar&#x27;s homeland in today&#x27;s Qinghai). Many Salars became adherents of Jahriyya or the &quot;New Teaching&quot;, as the Qing government officials dubbed it (in opposition to the &quot;Old Teaching&quot;, i.e. both the Khufiyya Sufi order and the non-Sufi Gedimu Islam). While the external differences between the Khufiyya and the Jahriyya would look comparatively trivial to an outsider (the two orders were most known for, respectively, the silent or vocal &quot;dhikr&quot;, i.e. invocation of the name of God), the conflict between their adherents often became violent.

Sectarian violence between the Jahriyya and Khufiyya broke out repeatedly until the major episode of violence in 1781. In 1781, the authorities, concerned with the spread of the &quot;subversive&quot; &quot;New Teaching&quot; among the Salars, whom they (perhaps unfairly) viewed as a fierce and troublesome lot, arrested Ma Mingxin and sent an expedition to the Salar community of Xunhua County to round up his supporters there. In the Jahriyya revolt sectarian violence between two suborders of the Naqshbandi Sufis, the Jahriyya Sufi Muslims and their rivals, the Khafiyya Sufi Muslims, led to a Jahriyya Sufi Muslim rebellion which the Qing dynasty in China crushed with the help of the Khafiyya Sufi Muslims.

The Jahriyya Salars of Xunhua, led by their &quot;ahong&quot; (imam) nicknamed Su Sishisan (&quot;Su Forty-three&quot;, 苏四十三), responded by killing the government officials and destroying their task force at the place called Baizhuangzi and then rushed across the Hezhou region to the walls of Lanzhou, where Ma Mingxin was imprisoned. When the besieged officials brought Ma Mingxin, wearing chains, to the Lanzhou city wall, to show him to the rebels, Su&#x27;s Salars at once showed respect and devotion to their imprisoned leaders. Scared officials took Ma down from the wall and beheaded him right away. Su&#x27;s Salars tried attacking the Lanzhou city walls, but, not having any siege equipment, failed to penetrate into the walled city. The Salar fighters (whose strength at the time is estimated by historians to be in 1,000–2,000 range) then set up a fortified camp on a hill south of Lanzhou. Some Han Chinese, Hui and Dongxiang (Santa) joined the Salar in the rebellion against the Qing.

To deal with the rebels, Imperial Commissioners Agui and Heshen were sent to Lanzhou. Unable to dislodge the Salars from their fortified camp with his regular troops, Agui sent the &quot;incompetent&quot; Heshen back to Beijing and recruited Alashan Mongols and Southern Gansu Tibetans to aid the Lanzhou garrison. After a three months&#x27; siege of the rebel camp and cutting off the Salars&#x27; water supply, Agui&#x27;s joint forces destroyed the Jahriya rebels; Su and all his fighters were all killed in the final battle. Overall, it is said that as much as 40% of their entire population was killed in the revolt.

As late as 1937, a folk ballad was still told by the Salars about the rebellion of 1781 and Su Sishisan&#x27;s suicidal decision to go to war against the Qing Empire.

The Qing government deported some of the Salar Jahriyya rebels to the Ili valley which is in modern-day Xinjiang. Today, a community of a few thousand Salars speaking a distinct dialect of Salar still live there. Salar migrants from Amdo (Qinghai) came to settle the region as religious exiles, migrants and as soldiers enlisted in the Qing army to fight rebels in Ili, often following the Hui. The distinctive dialect of the Ili Salar differs from the other Salar dialects because the neighboring Kazakh and Uyghur languages in Ili influenced it. The Ili Salar population numbers around 4,000 people. There have been instances of misunderstanding between speakers of Ili Salar and Qinghai Salar due to the divergence of the dialects. The differences between the two dialect result in a &quot;clear isogloss&quot;.

From the 1880s to the 1890s, sectarian strife was rife in the Salar community of Xunhua again. This time, the conflict was among two factions of the Hua Si &quot;menhuan&quot; (order) of the Khufiyya and in 1895 the local Qing officials ended up siding with the reformist faction within the order. Although the factional conflict was evident not only in Salar Xunhua but in Hui Hezhou as well, the troops were first sent to Xunhua – which again precipitated a Salar rebellion, which spread to many Hui and Dongxiang communities of Gansu too. It turned into the Dungan Revolt (1895), which was crushed by a loyalist Hui army.

The later Qing dynasty and Republic of China Salar General Han Youwen was born to a Tibetan woman named Ziliha (孜力哈) and a Salar father named Aema (阿額瑪).

The Hui people, also known as the &quot;white capped Hui&quot;, used incense during worship, while the Salar, also known as &quot;black capped Hui&quot;, considered this to be a heathen ritual and denounced it.
===Modern era===
Salars served in general Dong Fuxiang&#x27;s Kansu Braves army against the foreign western and Japanese Eight Nation Alliance in the Boxer rebellion. Other Muslims like Dongxiang, Bonan and Hui also served in the Kansu-Tibetan Braves.

Like other Muslims in China, the Salars served extensively in the Chinese military. It was said that they and the Dongxiang were given to &quot;eating rations&quot;, a reference to military service.

During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Salar troops and officers served in the Qinghai army of the Muslim general Ma Biao and they battled extensively in bloody battles against the Imperial Japanese Army in Henan province. In 1937, during the Battle of Beiping–Tianjin the Chinese government was notified by Muslim General Ma Bufang of the Ma clique that he was prepared to bring the fight to the Japanese in a telegram message. Immediately after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, Ma Bufang arranged for a cavalry division under Ma Biao to be sent east to battle the Japanese. Salars made up the majority of the first cavalry division which was sent by Ma Bufang. The Qinghai Chinese, Salar, Chinese Muslim, Dongxiang and Tibetan troops Ma Biao led fought to the death against the Japanese or committed suicide refusing to be taken as prisoner. In September 1940, when the Japanese made an offensive against the Muslim Qinghai troops, they ambushed them and killed so many of them the Japanese soldiers that they were forced to retreat. The Japanese could not even pick up their dead, they instead cut an arm from their corpses limbs for cremation to send back to Japan. The Japanese did not dare make an offensive like that again.

Han Youwen, a Salar general in the National Revolutionary Army and member of the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party), directed the defense of the city of Xining during air raids by Japanese planes. Han survived an aerial bombardment by Japanese planes in Xining while he was being directed via telephone from Ma Bufang, who hid in an air raid shelter in a military barracks. The bombing resulted in human flesh splattering a Blue Sky with a White Sun flag and Han being buried in rubble. Han Youwen was dragged out of the rubble while bleeding and he managed to grab a machine gun while he was limping and fired back at the Japanese warplanes. He later defected to the Communist People&#x27;s Liberation Army, serving in numerous military positions and as vice chairman of Xinjiang. He had led Chinese Muslim forces against Soviet and Mongol forces in the Pei-ta-shan Incident.

==Culture==

The Salar had their own unique kinship clanships. Matchmakers and parents arrange marriages among the Salar. The Salar are an entrepreneurial people, going into multiple businesses and industries. They practice agriculture and horticulture. They cultivate chili and pepper in their gardens. Buckwheat, millet, wheat and barley are among the crops they grow. Other important crops include melons, grapes, apples, apricots and walnuts. A few Salar raise livestock and the local timber industry is also another source of income for some villages.

Hui general Ma Fuxiang recruited Salars into his army, and said they moved to China since the Tang dynasty. His classification of them is in two groups, five inner clans, eight outer clans. Ma said the outer group speaks Tibetan, no longer knowing their native language. Salars only married other Salars. Uighurs have said that they were unable to understand the Salar language.

Ma and Han are the two most widespread names among the Salar. Like the Hui, Ma is meant to substitute for Muhammad; however, many Salars also have the surname Ma due to intermarriage with the Hui. The upper four clans of the Salar assumed the surname Han and lived west of Xunhua. One of these Salar surnamed Han was Han Yimu, a Salar officer who served under General Ma Bufang. He fought in the Kuomintang Islamic Insurgency in China (1950–1958), leading Salars in a revolt in 1952 and 1958. Ma Bufang, enlisted Salars as officers in his army by exclusively targeting Xunhua and Hualong as areas to draw officers from.

18.69 years was the average first marriage age for Salar women in 2000, while Tibetan women were married at 23.8 years on average in 1990.

===Clothing===
The typical clothing of the Salar is very similar to the Hui people in the region. The men are commonly bearded and dress in white shirts and white or black skullcaps. The traditional clothing for men is jackets and gowns. The young single women are accustomed to dressing in Chinese dress of bright colors. Married women utilize the traditional veil in white or black colors.

===Music===
Singing is part of Salar culture. A style of singing called Hua&#x27;er is shared among the Han, Hui, Salar and Tibetans in Qinghai province. They have a musical instrument called the &quot;Kouxuan&quot;. It is a string instrument manufactured in silver or in copper and only played by the women.

==Language==
The people of China and Salar themselves regard the Salar language as a &quot;Tujue&quot; language (Turk language) (突厥語言). The Salar language has two large dialect groups. The divergence is due to the fact that one branch in Xunhua county of Qinghai province and Gansu province was influenced by the Tibetan languages and Chinese and the other branch in Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture by the Uyghur and Kazakh languages.

In the late 1990s, it was estimated that out of the some 89,000 Salars, around 60,000 spoke the Salar language.

Most Salar do not use any written script for the Salar language, instead they use Chinese characters for practical purposes. Salar serves as their spoken language, while Chinese serves as a both spoken and written language. Many of the current generation of Salars are fluent in Chinese and Tibetan.

The Salar language spoken in Amdo Tibet (Qinghai) is a language of Turkic origin that has been heavily influenced by the Chinese and Tibetan languages. Around 20% of the vocabulary is of Chinese origin and 10% is of Tibetan origin. Morphological and syntactic structures have been fully borrowed from these latter languages. Yet, according to author William Safran, linguistic works published in China treat Salar as if it has few loanwords from these languages, omitting most Chinese and Tibetan features. The Salar mostly use the Chinese writing system, although Latin and Arabic alphabets are used on occasion. The Salar language has taken loans and influence from neighboring Chinese varieties. It is neighboring variants of Chinese which have loaned words to the Salar language. In Qinghai, many Salar men speak both the Qinghai dialect of Chinese and Salar. Rural Salars can speak Salar fluently while urban Salars often assimilate into the Chinese speaking Hui population.

In Ili Salar, the i and y high front vowels, when placed after an initial glides are spirantized with j transforming into ʝ. Qinghai and Ili Salar have mostly the same consonantal development.

==Religion==
Salars profess Sunni Islam and follow the Hanafi school of law. In addition to their traditional places, they live in cities, mainly inhabited by other Muslims – Dungans. Islamic Education Received at Gaizi Mişit Madrasah in Jiezi Village.

Many Salar adhere to the Naqshbandi Sufi order, which spread throughout the region in the 17th and 18th centuries.

==Genetics==
The Y-DNA haplogroups and therefore the paternal genetic lineages of the Salar people, exhibit a mix of West Eurasian and East Asian haplogroups. Their maternal lineages are overwhelmingly East Asian. About 24–30% Y chromosomes of Salar belong to the East Asian specific haplogroup O3-M122, while the Central Asian, South Asian and European prevalent Y chromosomal lineage R-M17 comprises only 17%. Other Y-DNA haplogroups among the Salars are D1 and C3. Another study showed that the haplogroup O1b1a1a1b2 was also present in Salars.

An autosomal genetic study (Ma &quot;et al.&quot; 2021) estimated that West Eurasian-related admixture (represented by ancient Andronovo samples) among Salars was at ~9.1% to ~11.8%, with the remainder being dominant East Eurasian ancestry; might derive from &quot;Yellow River Basin farmers&quot; (YR_LBIA) or &quot;Liao River farmers&quot; (WLR_LN) at ~88.2 to ~90.9%. The study also showed that there is a close genetic affinity among ethnic minorities in Northwestern China (Uyghurs, Huis, Dongxiangs, Bonans, Yugurs and Salars) and that these cluster closely with other East Asian people, especially with other Chinese Turkic, Mongolic and Tungusic speakers, indicating the probability of a shared recent common ancestor of &quot;Altaic speakers&quot;.

<text>The Bulang people (; also spelled Blang) are an ethnic group. They form one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

==Languages==
People classified as Bulang in China speak various Palaungic languages, including Blang and U.

The Blang language belongs to the Palaungic branch of the Austroasiatic language family. Within the Palaungic branch, Blang belongs to the Waic subgroup, which also contains the languages of the Wa and Lawa peoples in addition to Blang. Some Blang also speak the Chinese language and Southwestern Tai languages in addition to Blang. Two systems of writing, based on the Latin alphabet, have been developed: &#x27;Totham&#x27; in the Xishuangbanna and &#x27;Tolek&#x27; from Dehong and Lincang.

==History==
Chinese ethnographers identify the Blang as descendants of an ancient tribe known as the &quot;Pu&quot; (濮), who lived in the Lancang river valley during ancient times. It is believed that these people were one branch of a number of peoples that were collectively known to the ancient Chinese as the Bǎipú (百濮, literally Hundred Pu).

==Culture==
Traditionally, the Blang considered teeth blackened by chewing betel nuts a beauty characteristic.

The women usually dress in jackets with black skirts. The men had tattoos in the torso and the stomach. They dressed in wide black trousers and jackets buttoned to the front. Often, they would wear turbans of either white or black fabric.

The houses of the Blang are made out of bamboo and usually consist of two floors. The first floor is designed as a warehouse for food and a stable for livestock animals, such as chickens, whereas the second is designed to house the family. The chimney is located in the center of the house.

The Blang are traditionally divided into small clans, with each clan owning its own land. Every Blang town has its own cemeteries, which are divided by clans. The deceased are buried, with the exception of those who perished due to unnatural causes. In this case, they are cremated.

Bulang are among the earliest known cultivators of tea, with natural tea forest canopy home to unique species &amp; ecosystems as opposed to monoculture fertilizer &amp; pesticide-consuming tea plantations.

==Religion==
The Blang are traditionally associated with animism, ancestor worship, and Theravada Buddhism. Writing in 2011, James Miller described these overlapping traditions as follows: 

A Christian missionary source describes them as &quot;ardent followers of Theravada Buddhism&quot;, and offers as an estimate that 80% of the Bulang are &quot;professing Buddhists&quot;, with a lower estimate of 35% being &quot;practicing Buddhists&quot;.

==Distribution==
The Bulang are distributed in the following villages of Yunnan province (Tao 2012:16-18). Except for the Bulang of Xishuangbanna, the Bulang of most of these counties speak the U language (Svantesson 1991). Locations from Wang &amp; Zhao (2013:173-179) are also included.

<text>The Maonan people (; Maonan: &quot;Anan&quot;, literally &quot;local people&quot;) are one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by the People&#x27;s Republic of China. There are a total of 101,192 Maonan as of 2010, mostly living northern Guangxi and southern Guizhou in southern China.

The Maonan people&#x27;s autonyms are &quot;ʔai1 na:n6 &quot;(a Maonan person), &quot;kjɔŋ5 na:n6&quot; (the Maonan people). Their language is called &quot;va6 na:n6&quot; (Lu 2008:33).

==Language==
==Society==
More than 80% of the Maonan share the same surname: &quot;Tan&quot; (). Maonan with the surname &quot;Tan&quot; believe that they are descended from the old inhabitants of the province of Hunan that migrated to Guangxi and married Maonan women. Other common surnames found in this ethnic group are: &quot;Lu&quot; (卢/盧), &quot;Liu&quot; (刘/劉), &quot;Shi&quot; (石), &quot;Qin&quot; (覃), &quot;Wei&quot; (韦/韋) and &quot;Yuan&quot; (袁).

The towns of the Maonan do not surpass more than 100 dwellings. Their towns are organized by clan. Their dwellings are very similar to those of the Zhuang; they are usually made up of two floors and constructed out of planks and clay. The upper floor is used as the living quarters while the lower one serves as a granary and stable.

Traditionally, the marriages were arranged by the parents when the future newlyweds are still children. Traditionally when a Maonan woman became a widow, the brother of her late husband took her as his wife.

During the funeral service, the children of the deceased had to &quot;buy&quot; water of a river to be able to wash the corpse. Before proceeding to the burial, the blood of a chicken was poured on the land to purify it and to bless the spirit of the dead person.

==Cuisine==
Maonan cuisine includes many pickled dishes, of which the most famous ones are known as the &quot;sa:m1 səm3 ta5 ma:u6na:n6&quot; (three-sour-middle-Maonan) &quot;The Three Maonan Sour Dishes&quot; (Lu 2008:47). These three dishes are:

#&quot;na:n4 səm3&quot; - pickled meat
#&quot;zo5 fa:t7&quot; - fermented soup
#&quot;ʔɔŋ5 ʔwu:i5&quot; - (dish preserved with) lime in an urn

Rice wine is also popular among the Maonan.

==Religion==
Traditional Maonan religion is both animistic and polytheistic, with heavy Taoist influences. Many deities and rituals are borrowed from Chinese folk religion. Important figures and deities are listed below (Lu 2008:51).

*Kitchen God - for the family&#x27;s welfare
*God of Earth - for peaceful outdoor activities
*General Li Guang - A historical figure from the Western Han Dynasty who is venerated as a protector of villages.
*Shentu and Yulei - These two legendary figures protect homes from malevolent devils by feeding them to tigers. They are placed on front doors to ward off evil.
*Thunder God
*The Thunder Soldiers
*Flower God
*Guanyin
*&quot;muŋ2 ku:n1 &quot; - an evil immortal
*&quot;lu2 pa:n1&quot; - a historical figure who was a master carpenter
*&quot;lɔk8 gi:u2&quot; - a legendary figure who was a bridge builder
*&quot;ʔbi:u2&quot; - Emperor Yao
*&quot;sa:m3 ȵɔn2&quot; - a religious figure
*&quot;za4 wa:ŋ2&quot; - the God of the Earth
*&quot;ni4 fa:n1 su:i5&quot; - the Goddess of Birth

Maonan household shrines are called &quot;ji:ŋ1 wa3&quot; (Lu 2008:51). The shrine consists of a wooden plate on a wall facing the front entrance. Names of deities and family ancestors are written on the plate.

The Maonan people also perform a redemptive ritual called &quot;vɛ4 da:u4&quot; in order to show gratitude to &quot;ni4 fa:n1 su:i5&quot; (cf. Chinese: &quot;Wansui Niangniang&quot; 万岁娘娘, the birth goddess). During Maonan weddings, couples ask the birth goddess for fertility. After the couple has children, they thank the birth goddess by offering 26 animals (1 ox, 7 small pigs, and 19 chickens and ducks).

<doc id="330840" wikidata="Q1790733" url="?curid=330840" title="Cripple">
<text>A cripple is a person or animal with a physical disability, particularly one who is unable to walk because of an injury or illness. The word was recorded as early as 950 AD, and derives from the Proto-Germanic &quot;krupilaz&quot;. The German and Dutch words &quot;Krüppel&quot; and &quot;kreupel&quot; are cognates.

By the 1970s, the word generally came to be regarded as pejorative when used for people with disabilities. &quot;Cripple&quot; is also a transitive verb, meaning &quot;cause a disability or inability&quot;. The word &quot;crippling&quot; is also used as an adjective. 

== Reappropriation ==

In the same way that the term &quot;queer&quot; has been reappropriated by the gay rights movement, members of the disability rights movement have reclaimed words such as &quot;cripple&quot;, &quot;crip&quot;, and &quot;&quot; to refer to themselves. The &quot;cripple tribunal&quot; in Dortmund on 13 December 1981 was one of the main protest actions of the autonomous German disability movement (in confrontation with the established disability assistance) against human rights abuses in nursing homes and psychiatric hospitals, as well as against deficiencies of local public transport. Analogous to the Russell Tribunal by Amnesty International, the &quot;cripple tribunal&quot; has denounced human rights violations of disabled people.

== Other usages ==
* The Crips street gang were so named when members started carrying a cane which gave the impression they were disabled.
* A cripple is a trimmer stud or joist which is shorter than full-length.
* A cripple is a goods wagon or a passenger coach which although safe to run on the railway, is not fit for use and requires a repair before it can be used in service. This could be a coal wagon with a hole in the floor (which would allow coal to fall out of the wagon), or a passenger coach with a broken window.

<doc id="330841" wikidata="Q877377" url="?curid=330841" title="Pumi people">
<text>The Pumi (also Primi or Premi) people (Tibetan: བོད་མི་, Wylie: bod mi, , autonym: ) are an ethnic group. They form one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by China.

Ethnically related to the Tibetans of the Mili Tibetan Autonomous County and Yanyuan County in Sichuan, the Pumi are recognized as an official minority nationality unique to Yunnan, with a population of 30,000. Communities are found notably in Lanping Bai and Pumi Autonomous County, Ninglang Yi Autonomous County, Lijiang Old Town, Yulong Naxi Autonomous County, Weixi Lisu Autonomous County and Yongsheng County, typically at elevations above .

== Language ==

Prinmi, the Pumi language, belongs to the Qiangic branch of the Tibeto-Burman family. In the past, it was noted that the Pumi in the Muli and Ninglang areas used the Tibetan script mainly for religious purposes, although gradually the Tibetan script fell into disuse and oblivion. In modern times, the Pumi receive education in Chinese. A pinyin-based Roman script has been proposed, but the orthography has yet to be promoted.

== History ==

The Pumi have a long history and their path of migration is historically traceable. Originally, they lived as nomads inhabiting the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. Later, they moved to the warmer areas along valleys within the Hengduan Mountain Range in the 4th century B.C. Their ancestors probably are the ancient Qiang people, a nomadic tribe on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

Subsequently, they moved to Northern Sichuan in the 7th century, and subsequently to northwest Yunnan in the 14th century. Many of them settled down to become farmers, and local landlords dominated the Pumi economy in Lanping and Lijiang counties. Except for a small number of common areas, the landlords held large areas of lands and collected rental fees from the peasants. This accounted for at least 50 per cent of the harvest. Pumi landlords and Nakhi chiefs also traded domestic slaves.

With the coming of the Cultural Revolution, the landlords&#x27; powers were severely weakened. The coming of modern facilities and technologies, such as hospitals and factories, have also greatly changed the lifestyle of the Pumi.

== Religion ==

Due to their contact with Tibetans, the religion of the Pumi has been heavily influenced by Tibetan Buddhism and the older practice of Bön. Today, this amalgamation is known as Hangui (韩规) and shares much in common with the Dongba practices of the Nakhi people. A form of ancestor worship is also present among the Pumi.

Through the efforts of Tibetan Buddhist missionaries from Tibet, a significant proportion have adopted the Gelugpa and Kagyu lineage of Tibetan Buddhism, much of whom are those in Sichuan.

The Zanbala religion, also locally known as Dingba, literally means white earth. It is noted that the Pumi around Ninglang still install Zanbala altars in their home, which were worshipped by the older generations. The Zanbala religion consists of the veneration of three gods and ancestral spirits, in which only the old men preside over the rituals and prayers.

Almost all Pumi villages have their own local mountain gods, which are worshipped during festive seasons. On those days, the entire family will give food offerings and pray for the good health and prosperity of the family. On the 15th day of each month, the minor mountain god is worshipped, and a grand ceremony is held on the 15th day of the 7th lunar month to venerate the Great Mountain God.

In many of the Pumi homes, a cooking fire ring plays an important part of Pumi beliefs. The ring should never be touched by guests. A Guazei, which consists of small stone towers, is located behind the fire rings. During mealtime, the oldest male will take a spoonful of the food, which will subsequently be placed on every tower. One spoonful will be thrown into the fire, which acts as a symbolic gesture to feed the spirits of their ancestors.

== Culture ==

Because of their origins, the Pumi are culturally influenced by the Tibetans. The Lunar New Year is also celebrated on the first fifteen days of the new year based on the lunar calendar. Losar is also celebrated by some as well.

Especially in Ninglang and Yongsheng, Pumi women often wear jackets with buttons down one side. Long and pleated skirts, multi-colored wide belts are worn. Owing to its cold weather, a goatskin is draped over their backs. However, in the case of the Lanping and Weixi areas, the womenfolk tend to wear colored long-sleeved jackets under their vests, along with long trousers which are fastened with embroidered belts. Like the Tibetans, Pumi women plait their hair with yak tail hairs and silk threads. Subsequently, their heads are wrapped in large cloths. Prized jewellery, such as silver earrings and bracelets are worn among the rich as well.

Pumi men tend to wear either sleeveless goatskin or linen jackets with and long trousers, which is accompanied by the Tibetan hat. Especially in the case of the hunters and warriors, a long Tibetan sword and deerskin bags may be carried. Upon reaching thirteen, the Pumi boys will go through the ablution rites of manhood and only after ablution may they put on adult clothing and take part in society&#x27;s activities.

== Lifestyle ==

Owing to its cold weather and its close proximity to Tibet, the lifestyle of Prinmi-speaking Tibetans closely resembles to that of the Tibetans. On the other hand, the Pumi living in Yunnan have adopted a lifestyle similar to that of Han Chinese. For instance, rice has become the staple food for most Pumi. Even in villages where the climate is too cold to grow the crop, many will trade potatoes for rice at the market place. A variety of vegetables and fruits such as the Chinese cabbage, beans, eggplant and melons serve as supplements.

Generally, the Pumi are a patrilineal and monogamous society, although polygamy is accepted in places like Yongning in northern Ninglang. Alongside the Mosuo, the Pumi here adopt a matriarchal system linked to the Azhu system, which literally means friendship, and families are formed by virtue of consanguinity instead of marriage.

The traditional way to preserve pork is to remove all the inner organs and the feet of a large pig. Lean meat is made into sausages while the entire slaughtered pig is sewed up after salt is added inside the body. The sewed-up salty body wrapped in pork skin, large in the bottom and small in the head, resembles the shape of a pipa after it is dried up. It is thus known by the Chinese nickname of &quot;Pipa meat&quot; and the whole body can be preserved for years.

A traditional beer-like drink called &quot;pri&quot; is brewed by every Pumi family in villages. It is an essential drink at wedding ceremony and hence the word for &#x27;to marry&#x27; is expressed as &#x27;to drink &quot;pri&quot;&#x27; in Prinmi.

<text>The Achang (), also known as the Ngac&#x27;ang (their own name) is an ethnic group. They are one of Tibeto-Burman languages speaking people. They form one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by the People&#x27;s Republic of China. They also live in Myanmar, where they&#x27;re known as Maingtha () in Shan State and Ngochang in Kachin State.

The Achang number 27,700, of whom 27,600 are from Yunnan province, mainly in Lianghe County of Dehong Autonomous Prefecture. The Achang speak a Burmish (Burmese-related) language called Achang, but there is no indigenous writing system to accompany it. Chinese characters are often used instead. Many Achang also speak the Tai Lü language, mainly to make commercial transactions with Dai people.

Speaking a distinct dialect, the Husa Achang (戶撒) living in Longchuan County (also in Dehong) consider themselves to be distinct and filed an unsuccessful application in the 1950s as a separate nationality. The Husa were more Sinicized than other Achang. For example, Confucian-styled ancestral memorial tablets are common in Husa homes. Most traditional Husa believe in a mixture of Theravada Buddhism and Taoism.

== History ==
The Achang are descendants of the Qiang tribes that 2,000 years ago inhabited the border region between Sichuan, Gansu and Sichuan provinces. The Achang people lived in the Yunlong area during the Yuan dynasty (1271–1268 AD). The Achang people are considered to be one of Yunnan&#x27;s earliest inhabitants. Their leader Zaogai made a rule in which the tribe leader could only be succeeded by the oldest son of the former leader. The Achang community became stronger and began to have trade relationships with other kingdoms like Jinchi and Bo. The Achang were descendants of the Xunchuan people during the Tang dynasty. In the 16th year of the reign of Emperor Honghu during the Ming dynasty (1383 AD), under the leadership of Zuona, the Achang people pledged allegiance to the emperor of the Ming dynasty. During Hongwu period, Duanbo from the Han nationality was appointed the governor of Yunlong Region, and from then on the Achang ethnic group was degraded and at the same time they began to move to live in Dehong region in the southwest and as a result lost their home native land. Today more than 90 percent of the 33,936 Achangs live in Longchuan, Lianghe and Luxi counties in the Dehong Dai-Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture in southwestern Yunnan Province. The rest live in Longling County in the neighboring Baoshan Prefecture.

== Culture ==
A great part of the history and traditions of the Achang has been transmitted from generation to generation through music and songs. Music is one of the mainstays of their culture, and they usually finish all celebrations with songs and dances.
Unmarried young people usually comb their hair with two braids that gather on their head. The typical clothes of the Achang vary according to village. Married women dress in long skirts, whereas unmarried women wear trousers.
The men usually use the colors blue, or black to make their shirts, buttoned to a side. Unmarried men surround their head with a fabric of white color, whereas married men wear blue.
In Buddhist funerals of the Achang, a long fabric tape of about 20 meters is tied to the coffin. During the ceremony, the monk in charge of the ritual, walks in front as opposed to holding the tape. By doing this, the monk helps directs the soul of the deceased so that the soul of the deceased arrives at its final destiny. The deceased is buried without any metallic elements, not even jewels, since it is believed that those elements contaminate the soul for future reincarnation.

<text>The Jino (also spelled Jinuo) people (, endonym: ) are a Tibeto-Burman ethnic group. They form one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by the People&#x27;s Republic of China. They live in an area called the Jino Mountains (Jinuoshan 基诺山) in eastern Jinghong, Xishuangbanna, Yunnan province.

The Jino are one of the less numerous of the recognized minorities in China and the last one included as &quot;national minority&quot; because they were only recognized in 1979. A former name used for the Jino, &quot;Youle&quot;, means &quot;following the maternal uncle,&quot; an indication of a matrilineal past.

The Jino have a population of 20,900 people according to the census of the year 2000. 
Most of the Jino concentrate in Jinoshan, in a series of mild hills with wet climate near Mengyang Township in Jinghong Municipality, Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan Province. They live in an area of about 70x50 km. They live in subtropical rainforest, home of elephants, wild oxen and monkeys.

Among their cultural practices is tooth painting, in which soot made from pear trees is used.

<text>The Palaung ( ; Thai: ปะหล่อง, also written as Benglong Palong) or Ta&#x27;ang (တ‌အောင်း) are one of the ancient Austroasiatic ethnic groups found in Shan State of Myanmar (Burma), Yunnan Province of China and Northern Thailand. In China, they are referred to as the De&#x27;ang people. The majority of population lives mainly in the northern parts of northern Shan State in the Pa Laung Self-Administered Zone, with the capital at Namhsan.

The Ta&#x27;ang (Palaung) State Liberation Army, the armed wing of the Palaung ethnic group, began fighting against the Burmese military in 1963. It entered a cease-fire agreement with the central government in April 1991, but is currently continuing the insurgency. The insurgency has become intense after TNLA actively involving in Operation 1027 which is a military offensive allied with many other revolutionary rebel forces in the country, against the Myanmar&#x27;s ruling military junta. The Myanmar military is believed to have derived benefit from poppy cultivation, which has caused serious drug addiction among the local people in Palaung region.

==Groups==

There are three main subgroups of Palaung: the Palé, Shwe and Rumai.

The Palé, Riang, Rumai and Shwe peoples are grouped together as the De&#x27;ang ethnic nationality. The group also includes the Danau (Danaw) who may no longer have a separate identity from the Palé.

==Language==
There are three main principal Palaung languages: Palé (Ruching), Rumai, and Shwe (Ta&#x27;ang or De&#x27;ang). Many Palaung are multilingual, speaking multiple varieties of Palaung, Burmese, Shan, and Jingpo. Use of Shan among the Palaung has declined, while younger Palaung prefer to use Burmese as a common language with speakers of other Palaung varieties. The Ta’ang Committee for Literature and Culture published the first Burmese-Ta&#x27;ang dictionary in 2012.

==Distribution==
In Myanmar, the majority of Palaung groups of Myanmar live in northern Shan State especially in northwestern regions while some are located in the southern parts. 

In Thailand, many of the Palaung in northern Thailand are refugees living in refugee camps. Many of them have fled in the past decades from Shan State to escape persecution and oppression at the hands of various Myanmar&#x27;s military rulers.

In China, the De&#x27;ang (Palaung) are found in the Zhenkang County and Gengma County.

==Religion==
The majority of Palaung are adherents of Theravada Buddhism and Buddhist temples can be found in most of their towns. At the age of ten, many children are sent to monasteries, primarily for education. Most of them return to lay life in later years.

However, some have also maintained their ethnic animist religion which is a system of beliefs based on evil spirits called nats. There has been a small amount of recent Christian missionaries work among them.

<text>Jackpot is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Elko County, Nevada, United States. The population was 855 as of the 2020 census. Located less than from the Idaho border on US 93, Jackpot has been a popular casino gaming destination for residents of Idaho and other neighboring states since its founding.

Jackpot is located south of Twin Falls, Idaho, a city of approximately 50,000. Although officially part of the Elko micropolitan area, Jackpot is often considered part of the Greater Twin Falls region.

In addition to its casino industry, Jackpot has its own schools, golf course, and post office. Its elevation is approximately above sea level.

Jackpot observes Mountain Time, along with other Idaho border towns such as Jarbidge, Mountain City and Owyhee, due to its economic ties with the Magic Valley region of southern Idaho. The Nevada Department of Transportation and Federal Aviation Administration recognize this local unofficial observance.

==History==
After Idaho outlawed all forms of casino gaming in 1954, &quot;Cactus Pete&quot; Piersanti and Don French moved their slot machine operations from Idaho to the Jackpot townsite. Piersanti&#x27;s and French&#x27;s gaming establishments were named Cactus Pete&#x27;s and the Horseshu Club, respectively. Piersanti in particular is credited for founding Jackpot.

In May 1958, the settlement was first recognized by the Elko County commissioners as an unincorporated town named &quot;Horse Shu&quot;, with a population of 65, despite a protest over the name by Cactus Pete&#x27;s. Because the club owners could not agree on a name, the county commissioners renamed it a month later as &quot;Unincorporated Town No. 1&quot;. The clubs compromised on the name &quot;Jackpot&quot; in 1959. Jackpot has been noted for its colorful place name which has been said to be the most unusual in the state of Nevada.

By 1960, the population had reached 400, but most residents were living in trailers because banks would not approve building loans, being unsure of the town&#x27;s long-term prospects.

Cactus Pete&#x27;s management took over the Horseshu in 1964 to form what would eventually become Ameristar Casinos. Cactus Pete&#x27;s and Horseshu, as well as the independent Barton&#x27;s Club 93 and the Four Jacks Casino, form the basis of the town&#x27;s economy.

==Geography==
Jackpot is located near Salmon Falls Creek and north of Middle Stack Mountain in the Granite Range of northeast Nevada. Jackpot is located about east (but by road) of the unincorporated town of Jarbidge and the Jarbidge Wilderness.

==Demographics==

The 2010 United States census reported that Jackpot had a population of 1,195. The racial makeup of Jackpot was 61% White (41% Non-Hispanic White), 1% African American, 32% from other races, and 4% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 56%.

There were 451 households, out of which 33% had children under the age of 18 living in them. The average household size was 2.65. There were 266 families (59% of all households); the average family size was 3.60.

The population was spread out, with 31% under the age of 18 and 9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34.2 years.

There were 622 housing units, of which 28% were vacant. Of the occupied units, 36% were owner-occupied and 65% were rented.

The median household income was $39,926, with 15% of the population living below the federal poverty line.

==Climate==
Jackpot experiences a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;) bordering a semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;) with hot summers and cold winters. Even with its relatively cool average temperature, Jackpot receives barely enough precipitation to avoid being classified as a desert climate. Due to Jackpot&#x27;s high elevation and aridity, temperatures drop sharply after sunset. Summer nights are comfortably cool, even chilly. Winter highs are generally above freezing, and winter nights are bitterly cold, with temperatures often dropping to zero or below.

==Transportation==
U.S. Route 93 bisects the town as it travels north towards Twin Falls and south towards Wells. The closest airport with commercial service is Magic Valley Regional Airport in Twin Falls. The community is also served by Jackpot Airport.

==Education==
Jackpot has a public library, a branch of the Elko-Lander-Eureka County Library System.

==Casino industry==
Jackpot has five main hotels and motels with casinos:
* Barton&#x27;s Club 93
* Cactus Pete&#x27;s, owned by Penn National Gaming, is the largest hotel in Jackpot with 300 guest rooms
* Four Jacks Hotel and Casino
* Horseshu Hotel and Casino, owned by Penn National Gaming. The casino is currently closed, but the hotel&#x27;s 100 guest rooms remain open
* West Star Hotel and Casino, the hotel here remains open but the casino has been closed since summer 2022
* Dotty&#x27;s

In 2005, Triad Resorts announced plans to build the Spanish Bit Resort and Casino, a resort casino with indoor waterpark and event center located on south of Jackpot. The project was delayed when the county mistakenly rezoned the land for the project. It was previously on schedule to be built starting in late 2010 or early 2011 after zoning and other concerns were addressed by developers and Elko County officials, but there has been no further news or development on the project since.

==In popular culture==
*A 2003 episode of &quot;&quot; is set in Jackpot, but none of the scenes were filmed there; Fawnskin, California, a town in the heavily wooded Big Bear Valley, was Jackpot&#x27;s stand-in in that episode.

<text>The Yugurs, Yughurs, Yugu (; Western Yugur: &quot;Sarïg Yogïr&quot;; Eastern Yugur: &quot;Šera Yogor&quot;), traditionally known as Yellow Uyghurs, are a Turkic-Mongolic ethnic group and one of China&#x27;s 56 officially recognized ethnic groups, consisting of 16,719 persons, according to the 2000 census. The Yugur live primarily in Sunan Yugur Autonomous County in Gansu. They are mostly Tibetan Buddhists. The majority of Yugurs speak a Turkic language, while Mongolic and Chinese are also used in eastern provinces.

==History==
The Turkic-speaking Yugurs are considered to be the descendants of a group of Old Uyghurs who fled from Mongolia southwards to Gansu after the collapse of the Uyghur Khaganate in 840, where they established the prosperous Ganzhou Uyghur Kingdom (870-1036) with capital near present Zhangye at the base of the Qilian Mountains in the valley of the Ruo Shui.

In 1037, the Yugur came under Tangut domination. As a result of Khizr Khoja’s invasion of Qumul, many residents who rejected conversion escaped to nearby Dunhuang and Hunan in China proper. These became the ancestors of the modern Yellow Uyghurs, who have remained
Buddhists to the present day.

In 1893, Russian explorer Grigory Potanin, the first Western scientist to study the Yugur, published a small glossary of Yugur words, along with notes on their administration and geographical situation.

==Language==
About 4,600 Yugurs speak Western Yugur (a Turkic language) and about 2,800 Eastern Yugur (a Mongolic language). Western Yugur has preserved many archaisms of Old Uyghur.

Both Yugur languages are now unwritten, although the Old Uyghur alphabet was in use in some Yugur communities until the end of 17th century.

<doc id="330849" wikidata="Q816691" url="?curid=330849" title="Bonan people">
<text>The Bonan people () are a distinct ethno-linguistic group from all other Mongolic peoples, living in Gansu and Qinghai provinces in Northwestern China. They are one of the &quot;titular nationalities&quot; of Gansu&#x27;s Jishishan Bonan, Dongxiang and Salar Autonomous County, which is located south of the Yellow River, near Gansu&#x27;s border with Qinghai.

Bonan are the 10th-smallest (47th out of 56) of the ethnic groups officially recognized by the People&#x27;s Republic of China. 95% of Bonan live in Jishishan County, numbering 21,400 of the county&#x27;s population.

==History==
The Bonan people are believed to be descended from Mongol and Central Asian soldiers stationed in Qinghai (around modern day Tongren County) during the Yuan dynasty. After the collapse of the Yuan dynasty, the ancestors of the Bonan stayed in the region and eventually intermingled with the surrounding Hui, Tibetan, Han, and Monguor peoples, which would contribute to the emergence of the modern Bonans.

The ancestors of the Bonan people were Tibetan Buddhism and it is known that around 1585 they lived in Tongren County (in Amdo Region; presently, in Qinghai Province), north of the Tibetan Rebgong Monastery. It was in that year that the town of Bao&#x27;an was founded in that area. Later on, some of the members of the Bonan-speaking community converted to Islam and moved north, to Xunhua County. It is said that they have been converted to Islam by the Hui Sufi master Ma Laichi (1681?–1766). Later, in the aftermath of the Dungan Rebellion (1862–1874) the Muslim Bonans moved farther east, into what&#x27;s today Jishishan Bonan, Dongxiang and Salar Autonomous County of Gansu Province.

Hui, Baoan and Dongxiang troops served under Generals Ma Fulu and Ma Fuxiang in the Boxer Rebellion, defeating the invading Eight Nation Alliance at the Battle of Langfang. Hui, Baoan, Dongxiang, Salar and Tibetan troops served under Ma Biao in the Second Sino-Japanese War against the Japanese.

It were the members of this Muslim part of the original Bonan community who are officially recognized as the separate &quot;Bonan&quot; ethnic group in today&#x27;s PRC. Their brethren who have remained Buddhist and stayed in Tongren, are now officially classified as part of the Monguor (Tu) ethnic group, even though they speak essentially the same Bonan language. The official concept of the &quot;Bonan ethnic group&quot; still remains somewhat artificial for the Bonans themselves.

==Language==

Both the Muslim Bonans in Gansu and their Buddhist cousins in Qinghai (officially classified as Monguor) have historically spoken the Bonan language, a Mongolic language. The Buddhist Monguor of Qinghai speak a slightly different dialect than the Muslim Bonan of Gansu. Whereas the Bonan language of Gansu has undergone Chinese influences, the Bonan language of Qinghai has been influenced by Tibetan. The language is also closely related to archaic versions of Mongolian.

There are 11 vowels in the Bonan language, as well as many compound vowels and there are 26 consonants, 5 of which are unstable.

They have no script for their language.

The Muslim Gansu Bonans are more numerous than their Buddhist Qinghai cousins (the estimates for the two groups were around 12,200 (in 1990) and around 3,500 (in 1980), respectively). However, it has been observed that in Gansu the use of Bonan language is declining (in favor of the local version – the &quot;Hezhou dialect&quot; – of Mandarin Chinese), while in Qinghai the language keeps being transmitted to younger generations.

==Genetics==
Distribution of Y-chromosome haplogroups in Bonan:
*O=23.43(O2=20.31,O1a=1.56,O1b=1.56)
*J=18.75
*R1=14.07(R1a=10.94,R1b=3.13)
*C=9.37
*N=9.17
*R2=6.25
*D=6.25
*I=4.69
*Others=8.02

In another study in 2010 found:
*K*=22.2
*O1b=18.5
*D*=14.8
*O2=14.8
*O*=7.4
*R1a=7.4
*R2=7.4
*N=3.7
*R1b=3.7

==Culture==
The Bonan share many traditions with the Dongxiang and Hui. Their traditional dress includes elements of Tibetan, Hui and Dongxiang clothing. Married Bonan women wear black veils, while unmarried women wear green veils. Women wear more colorful dress, including trousers with colored cuffs. Bonan men typically wear black or white skullcaps and white or dark blue jackets. Fur-lined jackets are used during the winter. 

The economy of the Bonan consists of farming (mainly wheat and rye), raising livestock, selling local handicrafts and working in the lumber industry. Bonan knives are renowned for their beauty and hardness and their manufacture and sale also form an important part of the local economy.

Popular pastimes for the Bonan include horse-riding, wrestling, and archery. The Bonan also enjoy poetry, singing, dancing and playing traditional Chinese instruments. Majority of the Bonan are Muslim. A small minority of Bonans are Tibetan Buddhists that reside in Qinghai, but they have been largely acculturated to neighboring ethnic groups.

The Bonan in Jishishan county follow a halal diet consisting mainly of beef and mutton, combined with carrots, potatoes and glass noodles. They also enjoy drinking tea. Bonan traditional villages have the roofs of the houses connected, in a way allowing the villagers to walk between houses over the roofs. However these traditional houses are rare nowadays.

<doc id="330852" wikidata="Q1059053" url="?curid=330852" title="Oroqen people">
<text>The Oroqen or Orochen people (Oroqen:; ; Mongolian: ) are an ethnic group in northern China. They form one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The Oroqen people are largely concentrated in the northern Chinese provinces of Heilongjiang and Inner Mongolia, which are home to 45.54% and 41.94% of the 8,259 Oroqen people living in China. The Oroqen Autonomous Banner is also located in Inner Mongolia.

The Oroqens are mainly hunters, and customarily use animal fur and skins for clothing. Many of them have given up hunting and adhered to laws that aimed to protect wildlife in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The government has provided modern dwellings for those who have left behind the traditional way of life. The Oroqen are represented in the People&#x27;s Congress by their own delegate and are a recognized ethnic minority.

In the Russian Empire, various peoples in various places were called Orochen (; orthography before Soviet reform), in several variants (орочон, орончон, орочен). One of the most commonly accepted hypotheses is that the term is derived from the Manchu language: орунчунь (&quot;orunchun&quot;) meaning &quot;deer people&quot;, or &quot;deer herders&quot; (cf. pinyin &quot;Èlúnchūn&quot;). This is not a self-naming of these peoples, but an exonym, i.e., assigned to them by Manchu, Tungus, or Russians, sometimes due to misunderstanding. Therefore old documents speaking about &quot;orochon&quot;/&quot;orochen&quot; must be considered cautiously.

== Language ==

The Oroqen language is a Northern Tungusic language. Their language is very similar to the Evenki language and it is believed that speakers of these two languages can understand 70% of the other language. Their language is still unwritten; however, the majority of the Oroqen are capable of reading and writing Chinese, and some can also speak the Daur language.

== History ==

The Oroqen (Mongolian &quot;Guruchin&quot;) are one of the oldest ethnic groups in northeast China. The endonym &quot;oroqen&quot; means &quot;people who keep reindeer, reindeer herder(s).&quot; The ancestor of the Oroqen originally lived in the vast area south of the Outer Khingan Mountains and north of Heilongjiang.

They once formed part of the ancient people known as the Shiwei. In the 17th century, following invasions by the Russian Empire, some Oroqens moved to the area near the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains.

During the Japanese occupation of Manchuria, the Oroqen suffered a significant population decline. The Japanese distributed opium among them and subjected some members of the community to human experiments, and combined with incidents of epidemic diseases this caused their population to decline until only 1,000 remained. The Japanese banned Oroqen from communicating with other ethnicities, and forced them to hunt animals for them in exchange for rations and clothing which were sometimes insufficient for survival, which lead to deaths from starvation and exposure. Opium was distributed to Oroqen adults older than 18 as a means of control. After 2 Japanese troops were killed in Alihe by an Oroqen hunter, the Japanese poisoned 40 Oroqen to death. The Japanese forced Oroqen to fight for them in the war which led to a population decrease of Oroqen people. Even those Oroqen who avoided direct control by the Japanese found themselves facing conflict from anti-Japanese forces of the Chinese Communists, which also contributed to their population decline during this period.

Following the expulsion of the Japanese from Manchuria, the Oroqen came under suspicion from the Chinese Communists as counterrevolutionaries and were subjected to persecution, particularly during the Cultural Revolution between 1966 and 1976. Some Oroqen were driven to suicide due to intense interrogation by Chinese Communist authorities, as well as having to endure public humiliations and beatings.

== Culture ==
The Oroqen are exogamous, only marriages among members of different clans being permitted.

The traditional dwelling is called a &quot;sierranju&quot; () and is covered in the summer with birch bark and in the winter with deer furs. These dwellings have conical forms and are made out of 20 to 30 pine sticks. The dwellings are usually about six meters in diameter and five meters in height. In the centre a fire is placed that serves as a kitchen, as well as a source of lighting. Birch bark is an important raw material in the traditional culture alongside the furs. It serves for the preparation of containers of all types, from the manufacture of cradles to boats. With respect to the reindeer herding of the Evenki, Oroqen and Nanai, which all shared the use of birch bark, it can be said that these cultures are part of a &quot;birch bark&quot; culture.

The Oroqen is now among China&#x27;s most highly educated ethnic groups. 23.3% of the ethnic group received college education, only less than Russian Chinese, Chinese Tatars and Nanais. 19.2% received only primary school education or less, only higher than Koreans, Russian Chinese and Nanais.

== Religion ==

Until the early 1950s the main religion of the nomadic Oroqen was shamanism. In the summer of 1952 cadres of the Chinese Communist Party coerced the leaders of the Oroqen to give up their &quot;superstitions&quot; and abandon any religious practices. These tribal leaders, Chuonnasuan (Meng Jin Fu) and Zhao Li Ben, were also powerful shamans. The special community ritual to &quot;send away the spirits&quot; and beg them not to return was held over three nights in Baiyinna and in Shibazhan.

The last living shaman of the Oroqen, Chuonnasuan (), died at the age of 73 on 9 October 2000. His life, initiatory illness, and training as a shaman are detailed in a published article, also available online.

Chuonnasuan was the last living shaman who practiced his craft prior to the communist banishment of such &quot;superstitions&quot; in this region in 1952. Over three nights in July 1952, in several separate communities, the Oroqen peoples held rituals in which they begged the spirits to leave them forever. Evidence for and enhancement of auditory (spirit songs) and visual mental imagery during altered states of consciousness can be found in Chuonnasuan&#x27;s account of his practice of shamanism. Noteworthy is that he reported performing only one ritual journey to the lower world, which he called &quot;Buni.&quot; This term for the lowerworld or land of the dead is identical to that used by the Nanai people of Siberia in accounts of shamans collected almost a century ago. Sacrifices to ancestral spirits are still routinely made, and there is a folk psychological belief in animism.

Traditionally the Oroqen have a special veneration for animals, especially the bear and the tiger, which they consider their blood brothers. The tiger is known to them as &quot;wutaqi&quot;, which means &quot;elderly man&quot;, while the bear is &quot;amaha&quot;, which means &quot;uncle“.

== Cultural revival initiatives ==

For tourism and other cultural activities, there are presently three new museums in the Autonomous Banner, one of which is dedicated to The Northern Wei Dynasty.

<doc id="330854" wikidata="Q617614" url="?curid=330854" title="Derung people">
<text>The Derung (also spelt Drung or Dulong) people (; endonym: ) are an ethnic group. They form one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by China. Their population of 6,000 is found in the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan in the Derung Valley of Gongshan Derung and Nu Autonomous County. Another 600 can be found east of the Derung Valley, living in the mountains above the Nu River (Salween River) near the village of Binzhongluo in northern Gongshan Derung and Nu Autonomous County.

== Language ==
The Derung speak the Derung language, one of the Sino-Tibetan languages. Their language is unwritten; in the past the Derung have transmitted messages and have made records by making notches on wooden logs.

== History ==
There are few documents about the origins of the Derung. It is known, nevertheless, that during the period of the Tang dynasty, the Derung were under the jurisdiction of Nanzhao and the Dali Kingdom. The Derung Valley area, the southernmost part of Tsawarong, was known by the Tibetans as &quot;Changyul&quot; or &quot;Kiongyul&quot;, meaning the &quot;valley of beer&quot; because Derung people enjoy drinking.
From the Yuan dynasty to the Qing dynasty, the Derung were governed by the local Tibetan or Nakhi rulers. They also paid yearly tribute to China; the local Lama, called Changputong, was in charge of sending it to Weixi. In 1913, the Derung helped to repel a British attack in the area. Prior to 1949, there were several other names used for this ethnic group; they were known as &quot;Qiao&quot; during the Yuan and &quot;Qiu&quot; and &quot;Qu&quot; during the Qing.

== Culture ==
Prior to the formation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Derung society was based on a system of clans. A total of 15 clans existed, called &quot;nile&quot;; each one of them was formed by diverse familiar communities. Each clan divided itself into &quot;ke&#x27;eng&quot;, towns in which the Derung lived in common houses. Marriages between clans were prohibited.

The typical dress of the women consists of a dress made of fabric lined with colors black and white. Formerly, the women used to tattoo their faces when they reached the age of twelve or thirteen. The tattoos of some women resembled masculine mustaches.

Houses are usually constructed out of wood. They are two stories in height; the second floor is designed as the living quarters for the family whereas the first level serves as a barn and stable. When a male member of the family is married, a new section is added to the family&#x27;s house where he and his new wife will live in.

== Religion ==
Although some Derung have converted to Christianity, the vast majority continue to believe in their animist native religion. There is a belief that all creatures have their own souls. Usually diverse sacrifices are made in order to calm down the malignant spirits.
The role of the shaman is of great importance since they are the ones in charge of the rituals. During the celebrations of the Derung New Year, which is celebrated in the month of December of the lunar calendar, diverse animal sacrifices are celebrated to make an offering to the sky.
