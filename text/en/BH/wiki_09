<text>The Megleno-Romanians, also known as Meglenites (), Moglenite Vlachs or simply [[Vlachs]] (), are an Eastern Romance ethnic group, originally inhabiting seven villages in the Moglena region spanning the Pella and Kilkis regional units of Central Macedonia, Greece, and one village, Huma, across the border in North Macedonia. These people live in an area of approximately 300 km2 in size. Unlike the Aromanians, the other Romance-speaking population in the same historic region, the Megleno-Romanians are traditionally sedentary agriculturalists, and not traditionally transhumants. Sometimes, the Megleno-Romanians are referred as &quot;Macedo-Romanians&quot; together with the Aromanians.

They speak a Romance language most often called by linguists Megleno-Romanian or Meglenitic in English, and βλαχομογλενίτικα (&quot;vlakhomoglenítika&quot;) or simply μογλενίτικα (&quot;moglenítika&quot;) in Greek. The people themselves call their language &quot;vlahește&quot;, but the Megleno-Romanian diaspora in Romania also uses the term &quot;meglenoromână&quot;.

Unlike the other Eastern Romance populations, over time Megleno-Romanians have laid aside a name for themselves which originates in the Latin &quot;Romanus&quot;, and instead have adopted the term &quot;Vlasi&quot; or &quot;Vlashi&quot;, derived from &quot;Vlachs&quot;, a general term by which, in the Middle Ages, non-Romance peoples designated Romance peoples and shepherds. The term &quot;Megleno-Romanians&quot; was given to them in the 19th century by the scholars who studied their language and customs, based on the region in which they live.

Their number is estimated between 5,213 (P. Atanasov, most recent estimate), and 20,000 (P. Papahagi, 1900). There is a larger Megleno-Romanian diaspora in Romania ( 1,500 people), a smaller one in Turkey ( 500 people) and an even smaller one in Serbia. Greece does not recognize national minorities, thus this approximately 4,000-strong community does not have any official recognition from Greece. Another 1,000 Megleno-Romanians live in North Macedonia. It is believed, however, that there are up to 20,000 people of Megleno-Romanian descent worldwide (including those assimilated into the basic populations of these countries).

==History==
===Origins===
The Moglena region (Turkish: &quot;Karacaova&quot;) is located in the north of Greece at the border with North Macedonia. It is roughly bounded by the Vardar river to the east, by the Kožuf and Voras mountains to the west, by the plains of Giannitsa and Edessa to the south, and by the Mariansca Mountains to the north.

Historians Ovid Densusianu and Konstantin Jireček considered that Megleno-Romanians descended from a mixture of Romanians with Pechenegs, settled in Moglen by the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos in 1091. They argued this on the basis in part of the Asian-like facial appearance (more prominent cheek bones) of Meglen Vlachs. By contrast, Gustav Weigand and George Murnu believed that Megleno-Romanians were descendants of the Romanian-Bulgarian Empire who retreated to Moglen. This view was opposed by Jireček. Pericle Papahagi argued another version, according to which the Megleno-Romanians are descendants of a group of Romanians who were incorrectly called Vlachs and who came to Meglen area during the times of Dobromir Chrysos. Strez, another Vlach member of the Asan family, amplified Chrysos&#x27; lands by adding Macedonian territories for his principality.

Megleno-Romanians used to have a traditional custom, called &quot;bondic&quot;, where the head of a household would take an oak log and place it in the hearth just before Christmas, burning it bit by bit until Epiphany. The resulting charcoal would be put under fruit trees to make them fertile. A similar custom called &quot;bavnic&quot;, but with specific variations, also existed among Aromanians, some Romanians and Latvians. This custom is found in Orthodox South Slavic cultures (Serbian &quot;badnjak&quot;, Bulgarian &quot;budnik&quot;, Macedonian &quot;badnik&quot;). Some believe that these customs and other cultural archetypes discovered by scientists are proof that Megleno-Romanians come from a traditional mountainous region.

Theodor Capidan, studying the resemblance of the Megleno-Romanian language with Romanian and other languages, concluded that Megleno-Romanians must have spent some time in the Rhodope Mountains before moving on to Moglen (due to the presence of elements similar to those found in the language of the Bulgarians in the Rhodopes). Both Papahagi and Capidan observed that Aromanian and Megleno-Romanian lack a Slavic influence, but show Greek influence instead. The study of Megleno-Romanian and other Eastern Romance varieties led Capidan to believe that during the establishment of the Romanian language in the Early Middle Ages, there was an ethnic Romanian continuity on both banks of the Danube (north and south).

There were several small hamlets and cottage settlements at high elevations at the Mount Paiko before the founding of today&#x27;s Megleno-Romanian villages. From the medieval and modern periods, it is known that Megleno-Romanians had an administration of their own. Each village was led by a &quot;captain&quot;. Their economic and social centre was the town of &quot;Nânta&quot;. After the incursions of the Pomaks of Moglen against the Ottomans, the latter started a persecution campaign against villages in the area, including those of the Megleno-Romanians. Most of the villages were put under the administration of an Ottoman &quot;bei&quot;, who exploited them to the extreme in exchange for their security. The village of &quot;Oșani&quot;, however, resisted much longer before submitting to Ahmed Beg around 1790, having benefitted from the leadership of an able captain and a willingness from the population to put up an armed resistance even after his murder.

===Demographic history===
The number of Megleno-Romanians was estimated by different authors as follows:

*14,000 in 1892
*21,700 in 1895
*11,960 in 1900
*20,000 in 1902
*14,720 in 1925

In 1900, the then province of Gevgelija, which contained most of the Megleno-Romanian settlements, had a population of 49,315, of which 20,643 Slavs, 14,900 Turks, 9,400 Christian Aromanians and Megleno-Romanians, 3,500 Muslim Megleno-Romanians, 655 Romani, and 187 Circassians. The villages of Meglen Vlachs had in 1900 the following populations:

===20th century===
Most Meglen Vlachs are Orthodox Christians, but the population of the village of Nânti (Nótia), which in 1900 had a population of 3,660, of which 3,500 Megleno-Romanians, in the Upper Karadjova Plain converted to Islam in the 17th or 18th century. It is the only case among Eastern Romance populations of an entire community converting to Islam. The entire population of this village was expelled by force to Turkey in 1923, as part of the population exchange between Greece and Turkey, where they mostly settled in Kırklareli and Şarköy, and became known as Karadjovalides () after the Turkish name of Moglen ().

Since 1913, after the Second Balkan War, there was a general policy of the Balkan states to achieve greater ethnic uniformity through exchange of population. On September 29, 1913, a first such treaty was signed between Turkey and Bulgaria regarding exchange of population up to a range of 15 km from their border. The Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine (November 27, 1919) led to an exchange of 40,000 Greeks for 80,000 Bulgarians between the two countries. After the Greek-Turkish War, by the Treaty of Lausanne, 500,000 of Turks and other Muslims were exchanged for a comparable number of Asia Minor Greeks. Muslim Megleno-Romanians, despite all their protests were forcefully deported to Turkey because of their religion. A significant number of incoming Greeks were settled in Greek Macedonia and Greek Thrace, including in traditional Aromanian and Megleno-Romanian areas. Economic and social consequences soon ensued, and local conflict between Aromanians and Greeks appeared. Acts of intimidation by the Greek authorities led to the formation in 1921–1923 of a national movement among Aromanians and Megleno-Romanians favourable to the idea of emigration to Romania, especially from Moglena, Veria and Vodena.

In 1926, about 450 families of Megleno-Romanians of Greece moved to Romania, and settled in Southern Dobruja (the &quot;Cadrilater&quot; or &quot;Quadrilateral&quot;), a region which became Romanian in 1913. They originated from the villages of Oșani, Liumnița, Cupa, Lundzini, Birislav, and Livezi, and were settled in villages around the city of Silistra such as Cocina (Turkish: &quot;Koçina&quot;, now Profesor-Ishirkovo), Cazimir (Turkish: &quot;Kazemir&quot;, now Kazimir), Capaclia (Turkish: &quot;Kapaklı&quot;, now Slatina), Bazarghian (Turkish: &quot;Bezirgan&quot;, now Miletich), Aidodu (Turkish: &quot;Aydoğdu&quot;, now Zvezdel), Tatar Admagea (Turkish: &quot;Tatar Atmaca&quot;, now Sokol), Uzungi Ozman (Turkish: &quot;Uzunca Orman&quot;, now Bogdantsi), Strebarna Viskioi (Now Sreburna), Cadichioi (Turkish: &quot;Kadıköy&quot;, now Maluk Preslavets), Haschioi (Turkish: &quot;Hasköy&quot;, now Dobrotitsa).

After Bulgaria re-acquired Southern Dobruja from Romania in 1940, the Megleno-Romanians were deported during the population exchange between Bulgaria and Romania to other regions of Romania, most of them to the village of Cerna in the Tulcea County, in northern Dobruja. 270 families of Megleno-Romanians and 158 families of Aromanians settled in this village in 1940. However, between 1940 and 1948, the Aromanian families moved to other localities of Dobruja.

In 1947–1948, the new Communist authorities deported 40 Megleno-Romanian families from Cerna to Ialomița and Brăila Counties, and to Banat. Only a few of them returned to Cerna, where about 1,200 continue to speak Megleno-Romanian.

Another wave of Megleno-Romanians emigrated to Romania and to other countries during World War II and the Greek Civil War, due to the heavy fighting in the Moglena region.

==Geographical distribution==

The following is a list of the Megleno-Romanian settlements.

===Greece===
In seven villages (including one already assimilated by Greeks) and the small town of Notia, 4,000 Moglen Vlachs still speak their language today, while several thousand others are already assimilated:

 Archangelos (Megleno-Romanian: &quot;Oșani&quot;) 
 Karpi (Megleno-Romanian: &quot;Tarnareca&quot;)
 Koupa (Megleno-Romanian: &quot;Cupa&quot;) 
 Langadia (Megleno-Romanian: &quot;Lugunța, Lundzini&quot;) 
 Notia (Megleno-Romanian: &quot;Nânti, Nânta&quot;)
 Perikleia (Megleno-Romanian: &quot;Birislav&quot;) 
 Skra (Megleno-Romanian: &quot;Liumnița&quot;)

:Former Megleno-Romanian village
 Kastaneri (Megleno-Romanian: &quot;Barovița&quot;)

===North Macedonia===
Less than 1,000 people of Megleno-Romanian descent, most of whom are already Slavicized, live in one village and in the town of Gevgelija. 200, mostly old people, still speak the Megleno-Romanian:
* Huma (Megleno-Romanian: &quot;Uma&quot;)
:Former Megleno-Romanian villages
* Konsko (Megleno-Romanian: &quot;Coinsco&quot;) 
* Sermenin (Megleno-Romanian: &quot;Sirminia&quot;)

===Diaspora===
====Turkey====
The first emigration from Nanti was in 1912 to Soğucak, Vize and Demirköy, Kırklareli in the Ottoman Empire. In 1923, the entire population of the village of Nânti (Nótia), the only case among Eastern Romance populations with an entire community converting to Islam, was expelled by force to Turkey, as part of the population exchange between Greece and Turkey.

These 3,700 people mostly settled in the Edirne area (mainly in Kırklareli and Şarköy) of Turkish East Thrace, and became known as &quot;Karacaovalılar&quot; in Turkish or &quot;Karadjovalides&quot; in Greek after the region of Almopia or Meglen, known in Turkish as &quot;Karadjova&quot;. The Muslim Megleno-Romanians from the village Notia call thelmselves Nantinets and their language as Nantinești; in Turkish, they are known as Nutyalı. They converted to Islam in 1759. In Turkey, marriage between them and Pomaks was common.

 Kırklareli, near Edirne.

The number of families settled in Turkish cities and villages were: Kırklareli (110), Edirne (100), Şarköy (80), Babaeski (70), Lüleburgaz (80), Uzunköprü (100), Çorlu (100), Malkara (50), (10), Gözsüzköy (50), Kalamiş (50), Hoşköy (20), Mürefte (5), according to the German scholar Thede Kahl.

At present they number only 500 Karacaovalılar, concentrated in Kırklareli and culturally assimilated to the Turks (most of them speak mainly the Turkish language).

====Romania====
They adopted the Megleno-Romanian exonym promoted by the Romanian authorities. As of 1996, in the whole of Romania there were about 820 families claiming Megleno-Romanian origin.

 Cerna, a commune in Tulcea County,

Situated in a hilly landscape 55 km from the city of Tulcea and 25 km from Măcin, the village of Cerna had at the time of the 2002 Romanian census a population of 2,427, and together with three smaller villages the population of the entire commune was 4,227. Estimates of the number of Megleno-Romanians in this village vary from 1,200 to 2,000. In this locality, Megleno-Romanians settled according to the villages they originate from in Moglena: &quot;lumnicianii&quot;, those from &quot;Lumnița&quot; in the South-East, &quot;lunzaneții&quot;, those from &quot;Lugunța&quot; in the North, &quot;usineții&quot;, those from &quot;Oșani&quot; in the Center, North and North-East, &quot;cupineții&quot;, those from &quot;Cupa&quot; in the West, while Romanians and Bulgarians that lived in the village before them are concentrated in the Western part of the village.

Megleno-Romanians in that village preserved their Megleno-Romanian language very well. 1,200 people speak the language today.

However, their small overall number meant that after 1950 mixed marriages with Romanians became more frequent, unlike the Aromanians who by the nature of their traditional occupations have developed a special psychology, gaining importance in Romanian society and preserving the identity of their people (very few mixed marriages with Romanians occur). However, due to the hardships this small community has endured, Megleno-Romanians in Romania remain very united, with a very acute sense of nation. During their weddings, they use the Romanian tricolor as a &quot;furglița&quot; (wedding flag), and very rarely the traditional white-red colors. This illustrates the fact that despite their distinct (albeit also Eastern Romance) language, Megleno-Romanians in Romania identify themselves as Romanians. According to one observer, they consider themselves &quot;more Romanian than the Romanians&quot;.

Very small numbers of Megleno-Romanians also live in the communes of Variaș and Biled, and in the city of Jimbolia in Timiș County, in the historic region of Banat in Romania.

In Romania, in 2021, the Balkan Romanianness Day was established as a holiday meant for all the allegedly ethnic Romanian subgroups living south of the Danube. This includes the Megleno-Romanians as well as the Aromanians and the Istro-Romanians. It commemorates the establishment of the Ullah millet in 1905 and is officially celebrated every 10 May.

====Serbia====
A very small community of Megleno-Romanians also lives in Serbia, more precisely in the village of Gudurica in Vojvodina. Originally an ethnic German settlement, the Germans of the village were expelled following the capture of Gudurica by the Yugoslav Partisans. The repopulation of the settlement began in September 1945, and Slovenes, Croats, Bosniaks, Serbs, Albanians and Macedonians were sent to colonize Gudurica. Among the Macedonians were some with Aromanian and Megleno-Romanian ethnicity. Neither ethnic group was recognized by the Yugoslav government at the time, so they were ignored not only in what is now North Macedonia, but also in Gudurica. These Aromanians and Megleno-Romanians did not have a very strong ethnic identity, so many assimilated quickly. Some Megleno-Romanians also settled in other villages in Vojvodina, but only those in Gudurica remain today. However, they represent a very small community; as of 2014, only three people spoke Megleno-Romanian in Gudurica.

<text>ESPCI Paris (officially the École supérieure de physique et de chimie industrielles de la ville de Paris, , &quot;The City of Paris Industrial Physics and Chemistry Higher Educational Institution&quot;) is a grande école founded in 1882 by the city of Paris, France. It educates undergraduate and graduate students in physics, chemistry and biology and conducts high-level research in those fields. It is ranked as the first French &quot;École d&#x27;Ingénieurs&quot; in the 2017 Shanghai Ranking.

ESPCI Paris is a constituent college of Université PSL and a founding member of the ParisTech (Paris Institute of Technology) alliance.

Two thirds of the students enter the school following a competitive examination (concours X-ESPCI-ENS) following at least two years of Classes Préparatoires. The other students are recruited by submitting applications. The school itself is also known as Physique-Chimie or simply PC.

ESPCI Paris nurtures relationships with many industrial partners such as Schlumberger, Rhodia, TotalEnergies, Thales, Arkema, Michelin, Withings, which sponsors groups of students and has research contracts with ESPCI laboratories. ESPCI Paris also has partnerships with L&#x27;Oréal and Saint-Gobain for professional recruitment.

==History==
At the end of the 19th century, following the annexation of Alsace and Lorraine by Germany, France lost the École de Chimie de Mulhouse (Mulhouse Chemistry School), which was at that time the best chemistry school in the country. One of its professors, Charles Lauth, obtained permission from the government in 1878 to create a Grande École. In 1882 the École Supérieure de Chimie Industrielles de la Ville de Paris was established and became ESPCI, its current name, in 1948. Since its foundation, the founders of the school have emphasized pluridisciplinarity. Biology was introduced in 1994. There are no tuition fees at ESPCI.

After its establishment, the school rapidly became a meeting spot for the best scientists. From 1880 on, Pierre and Jacques Curie started a serie of research on crystal electrical properties that led to the piezoelectricity discovery. In 1897, Marie Curie started her work on uranic rays discovered by Becquerel one year earlier. After numerous experiments in the ESPCI laboratories, she discovered that pitchblende was 4 times more radioactive than uranium or thorium. In July 1898, the Curies announced the discovery of polonium and in December of the same year that of radium. Pierre and Marie Curie received the Physics Nobel Prize in 1903. After the death of her husband, Marie Curie was granted the Chemistry Nobel Prize in 1911.

Many former students have distinguished themselves, amongst which are Georges Claude (5th year), founder of Air Liquide, Paul Langevin (7th year), physicist and inventor and Frédéric Joliot-Curie (39th year), founder of the CEA and Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935 with his wife Irène Joliot-Curie.

In 1976, Pierre-Gilles de Gennes (Nobel Prize 1991) became Director of the school and remained in this position until his retirement in 2002.

In 2015, the city of Paris announced a major renovation plan, in order to modernize the buildings and laboratories of the school. Renovation work should start in 2018 and last five years.

==Education==
The course of study lasts four years. The two first years give the students a strong basic education in physics, chemistry and biology. The students can major in physics, chemistry or physico-chemistry. Laboratory research projects are also carried out. During the third year, the students carry out an industrial internship, which lasts from 4 to 6 months. More than 50% of the students do their internship abroad, in European countries, the United-States, Japan, China, Australia, or other countries. During the fourth year, the students can either begin doctoral studies or do a masters abroad or in France. In 2002 a masters program in bioengineering was created.

The quality of the education at ESPCI enables its students to work in any industrial sector (telecommunication, computing, chemistry, pharmacology, biology, and other fields), mostly in Research and Development (47% in R&amp;D, 10% in production, 10% in consultancy, 5% in environmental work, 3% in teaching, 3% in computing, 22% in other fields such as marketing or management).

==Admission==
The primary mode of admission (60 out of 90 students every year) is a competitive examination open to candidates enrolled in the PC (Physics-Chemistry) section of the Preparatory Classes to the Grandes écoles. The examinations are the same as for the Ecole Polytechnique but the components are weighted differently.
Candidates to the competitive examination must have their licence or an equivalent diploma. They must be aged between 17 and 22 on 1 January of the examination year. Foreign candidates must be under 26 and can attempt this examination three times.

It is also possible for students from the MP section (Maths-Physics), PSI section (Physics and Engineering Sciences), and BCPST section (Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Earth Sciences) of the preparatory classes or having completed 2 or 3 years of physics or chemistry in a French university to apply for ESPCI Paris. Admission is reserved to first class honours students selected according to their academic results.

<text>Jean Frédéric Joliot-Curie (; ; 19 March 1900 – 14 August 1958) was a French chemist and physicist who received the 1935 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with his wife, Irène Joliot-Curie, for their discovery of induced radioactivity. They were the second married couple, after his parents-in-law, to win the Nobel Prize, adding to the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes. Joliot-Curie and his wife also founded the Orsay Faculty of Sciences, part of the Paris-Saclay University.

== Biography ==

=== Early years ===
Born in Paris, France, Frédéric Joliot was a graduate of ESPCI Paris. In 1925 he became an assistant to Marie Curie, at the Radium Institute. He fell in love with her daughter Irène Curie, and soon after their marriage in 1926 they both changed their surnames to Joliot-Curie. At the insistence of Marie, Joliot-Curie obtained a second baccalauréat, a bachelor&#x27;s degree, and a doctorate in science, doing his thesis on the electrochemistry of radio-elements.

=== Career ===
While a lecturer at the Paris Faculty of Science, he collaborated with his wife on research on the structure of the atom, in particular on the projection, or recoil, of nuclei that had been struck by other particles, which was an essential step in the discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932. In 1935 they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their discovery of Induced radioactivity, resulting from the creation of short-lived radioisotopes by nuclear transmutation from the bombardment of stable nuclides such as boron, magnesium, and aluminium with alpha particles.

In 1937 he left the Radium Institute to become a professor at the Collège de France. In January 1939 he wrote a letter to his Soviet colleague Abram Ioffe, alerting him to the fact that German physicists had recently discovered nuclear fission of uranium bombarded by neutrons, releasing large amounts of energy. He went on to work on nuclear chain reactions and the requirements for the successful construction of a nuclear reactor that uses controlled nuclear fission to generate energy. Joliot-Curie was mentioned in Albert Einstein&#x27;s 1939 letter to President Roosevelt as one of the leading scientists on the course to nuclear chain reactions. The Second World War, however, largely stalled Joliot&#x27;s research, as did his subsequent post-war administrative duties.
At the time of the Nazi invasion in 1940, Joliot-Curie managed to smuggle his working documents and materials to England with Hans von Halban, Moshe Feldenkrais and Lew Kowarski. During the French occupation he took an active part in the French Resistance. In June 1941 he took part in the founding of the National Front, and became its president. In the spring of 1942, he joined the French Communist Party to become a member of its Central Committee in 1956. Collins and LaPierre in their book &quot;Is Paris Burning?&quot; note that during the Paris uprising in August 1944 he served in the Prefecture of Police, manufacturing Molotov cocktails for his fellow insurgents, the Resistance&#x27;s principal weapon against German tanks. The Prefecture was the scene of some of the most intense fighting during the uprising.

A team of scientists and intelligence officers from the allied Alsos Mission later found Curie at the Collège de France. He was sent to England to be interviewed and gave important information about the names and activities of German scientists.

=== Post-war ===
He served as director of the French National Centre for Scientific Research, and appointed by Charles De Gaulle in 1945, he became France&#x27;s first High Commissioner for Atomic Energy. In 1948 he oversaw the construction of the first French atomic reactor. He and Irène visited Moscow in June 1945 for the two hundred and twentieth anniversary of the Russian Academy of Sciences and returned sympathizing with &quot;hard-working Russians&quot;. His affiliation with the Communist party caused Irène to be detained on Ellis Island during her third trip to the US, coming to speak in support of Spanish refugees, at the Joint Antifascist Refugee Committee&#x27;s invitation. A devoted communist, he was purged in 1950 and relieved of most of his duties, but retained his professorship at the Collège de France. Joliot-Curie was one of the eleven signatories to the Russell–Einstein Manifesto in 1955. On the death of his wife in 1956, he took over her position as Chair of Nuclear Physics at the Sorbonne. Frédéric&#x27;s health was by that time declining, and he died in 1958 from liver disease, which, like the death of his wife, was said to be the result of overexposure to radiation.

== Honours and awards ==
Joliot-Curie was a member of the French Academy of Sciences and of the Academy of Medicine and named a Commander of the Legion of Honour.

He was elected a Foreign Member of England&#x27;s Royal Society (ForMemRS) and a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1946.

Joliot-Curie appeared as himself in &quot;Kampen om tungtvannet&quot; (&quot;La bataille de l&#x27;eau lourde&quot; in French; 1948), a French–Norwegian semi-documentary film about sabotage of the Vemork heavy water plant in Norway during World War II. His assistants Hans Halban and Lev Kovarski also appear. Joliot-Curie is shown lecturing about nuclear fission and chain reaction at the Collège de France.

He was the recipient of the first (1950) Stalin Peace Prize, awarded on 6 April 1951 for his work as president of the World Council of Peace, which he carried out from 1950 until his death in 1958.

A street in Sofia, Bulgaria, and the nearby Joliot-Curie Metro Station are named after Frédéric Joliot-Curie. Other streets or squares bearing his name can be found in the Rivière-des-Prairies borough of north Montreal, Canada; in Bucharest, Târgu-Mureș, and Cluj-Napoca, Romania; in Warsaw and Wrocław, Poland; and in Poprad, Slovakia; in Potsdam, Halle and Gera, Germany.

The crater Joliot on the Moon is named after him.

As part of the dispute over the discovery and naming of 
the transactinides, the name &quot;joliotium&quot; and symbol Jl were proposed for element 102 and later element 105.

== Personal life ==
Frédéric and Irène hyphenated their surnames to Joliot-Curie after they married on 4 October 1926 in Paris, France, although their daughter has said, &quot;Many people used to name my parents Joliot-Curie, but they signed their scientific papers Irène Curie and Frédéric Joliot&quot;.

Joliot-Curie&#x27;s daughter, Hélène Langevin-Joliot, was born in 1927. She is a nuclear physicist and professor at the University of Paris. Her brother, Pierre Joliot, was born in 1932. He is a biochemist at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.

Frédéric Joliot-Curie devoted the last years of his life to the creation of the Orsay Faculty of Sciences and a centre for nuclear physics at Orsay, now part of Paris-Saclay University, where his children were educated.

<doc id="324008" wikidata="Q17099654" url="?curid=324008" title="Local purchasing">
<text>Local purchasing is a preference to buy locally produced goods and services rather than those produced farther away. It is very often abbreviated as a positive goal, &quot;buy local&quot; or &quot;buy locally&#x27;, that parallels the phrase &quot;think globally, act locally&quot;, common in green politics.

On the national level, the equivalent of local purchasing is import substitution, the deliberate industrial policy or agricultural policy of replacing goods or services produced on the far side of a national border with those produced on the near side, i.e., in the same country or trade bloc.

Before industrialization and globalization became widespread, there were so many incentives to buy locally that no one had to make any kind of point to do so, but with current market conditions, it is often cheaper to buy distantly-produced goods, despite any added costs in terms of packaging, transport, inspection, wholesale/retail facilities, etc. As such, one must now often take explicit action if one wants to purchase locally produced goods.

These market conditions are based on externalized costs, argue local-economy advocates. Examples of externalized costs include the price of war, asthma, or climate change, which are not typically included in the cost of (for example) a gallon of fuel. Most advocates for local economics address contracting and investment, as well as purchasing.

Agricultural alternatives are being sought, and have manifested themselves in the form of farmers&#x27; markets, farmed goods sold through the community cooperatives, urban gardens, and even school programs that endorse community agriculture.

==Rationale for local purchasing==

Advocates often suggest local purchasing as a form of moral purchasing. Local purchasing is often claimed to be better for the environment and better for working conditions. Others contend (with empirical evidence) that local purchasing and contracting enhances local job creation and wealth while strengthening community cohesiveness.

The first potential moral benefit is environmental: Bringing goods from afar generally requires using more energy than transporting goods locally, and some environmental advocates see this as a serious environmental threat. Transportation contributes to environmental contamination in addition to the pollution caused by chemical inputs in the growing phase. Of course, locally produced goods are not always more energy-efficient; local agriculture or manufacturing may rely on heavy inputs (e.g., industrial agriculture) or energy-inefficient machinery and/or transportation systems. However, small-scale growers tend to be more environmentally friendly because industrial-sized agriculture uses genetically modified crops, monoculture production, and chemical fertilizer-intensive processes to grow crops—practices that local farmers typically avoid.

The second potential benefit is creating better working conditions. Nonetheless, while diverting purchasing from developing countries to local farmers helps build the local economy, it can lead to worse conditions for poor farmers in developing countries because it removes potential buyers from the market.

For communities, spending at local independent businesses also generates more jobs and wealth in the local economy compared to spending at absentee-owned businesses, including corporate chains.

The goal of localisation is to reduce unnecessary transport, support entrepreneurism and to strengthen and diversify community economies. This calls for condensation of agriculture and supports the idea that local farmers are capable of sustaining a community.

The term “Buy Local” has become subject to varying interpretations. While leading advocates of local independent business such as the American Independent Business Alliance say the term should apply only to locally owned independent businesses, some campaigns run by governments and chambers of commerce consider &quot;local&quot; to be merely a geographic consideration. Additionally, many corporations have manipulated the term in ways critics call &quot;local-washing&quot;.

==Alternative viewpoints ==

The argument that &quot;buying local&quot; is good for the economy is questioned by many economic theorists. They argue that transportation costs actually account for a fraction of overall production prices, and that choosing less efficient local products over more efficient nonlocal products is an economic deadweight loss. Moreover, the community as a whole does not actually save money because consumers have to spend so much more on the more expensive local products.

Similarly, the moral purchasing argument has been questioned as more and more consumers consider the welfare of people in countries other than their own. Most &quot;buy local&quot; campaigns rely on the implicit assumption that providing jobs for people in the consumers&#x27; own country is more moral than in &quot;foreign&quot; countries. They also imply that money going to foreign countries is worse than money staying in the consumers&#x27; own country. Increasingly, these campaigns have been called out as paranoid, jingoist and even xenophobic.
Additionally, organic local food tends to be more costly so this is not an appealing option to consumers who are shopping on a budget. Small-scale farmers do not receive government subsidies and are not able to support their business on prices comparable to those of industrial-scale food production, so they must sell at higher prices to make a living. Therefore, in order for the appeal of the local agriculture movement to overcome the economic cost, people must be willing to invest in it, which is unlikely when apparently similar products are available in grocery stores for a lower cost. Despite this, distribution costs of expansive food trade must also be factored in; with increasing gas prices, it becomes more expensive to ship food from outside sources.

Local purchasing preferences may conflict with procurement rules affecting public sector organisations. For example, in the UK, &quot;the country or territory of origin of supplies to, [and] the location in any country or territory of the business activities or interests of, contractors&quot; are considered &quot;non-commercial considerations&quot; which cannot be taken into account in making local government purchasing decisions.

==Import substituting==

In 2006, Michael Shuman proposed Local ownership import substituting (LOIS), as an alternative to neoliberalism. It rejects the ideology of there is no alternative. Shuman claims LOIS businesses are long term wealth generators, are less likely to exit destructively and have higher economic multipliers.

<text>Albert Rust (April 4, 1870) was an American politician and slaveholder, who served as a delegate from Arkansas to the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States from 1861 to 1862. A member of the Democratic Party, he was the U.S. representative from (1859–1861). He also served as a senior officer of the Confederate States Army who commanded infantry in the Eastern, Western, and Trans-Mississippi theaters of the American Civil War.

== Early life and career ==
Albert Rust was born 1818 in Fauquier County, Virginia, to William Rust and his wife Elizabeth; his exact birth date is not known. He was admitted to the bar in 1836 and the following year moved from Virginia to Arkansas, settling in Union County, Arkansas. He bought land and a store near the river in 1837. By 1838, he held the U.S. government contract to survey land in the new state. In 1839, the county seat was moved present day Champagnolle. His storehouse there, the only suitable building, became the courthouse.

Rust then read law and was admitted to the Arkansas bar. In 1842, he won a seat in the Arkansas House of Representatives, where he was re-elected twice, and also elected 1852–1854. He ran in a special election for an open congressional seat in 1846. He won fourteen counties, yet got only third place. In 1852 he was elected Speaker Pro-Tempore of the Arkansas House of Representatives, a very powerful position. Two years later. Democrats nominated him for United States Congress. He won the general election and went to Washington, D.C.

In 1856, Rust drew public attention for his efforts to oppose Nathaniel P. Banks of Massachusetts, who appeared likely to become Speaker of the House. Banks opposed further extension of slave territory, unlike Rust and his constituents. According to the Rust family history, he introduced a resolution that he said was meant to enable a compromise in the speakership contest, but &quot;New York Tribune&quot; newspaperman Horace Greeley characterized Rust&#x27;s resolution instead as an attempt to mislead the public about the principles involved and to oppose Banks&#x27;s candidacy. After Congress adjourned, on the day the &quot;Tribune&quot; reached Washington, Rust accosted Greeley on the Capitol grounds and felled him with his cane. A few days later, Rust again struck Greeley again on the streets of Washington. According to longtime journalist Benjamin Perley Poore, Rust, at his arraignment in court, &quot;appeared to glory in what he had done,&quot; after which Greeley&#x27;s &quot;more stalwart friends took care that he should not be unaccompanied by a defender when he appeared in public.&quot;

Rust showed little interest other than in military matters. He was not renominated; Edward A. Warren succeeded him. After working to regain his political reputation, Rust once again won a seat in the House of Representatives in 1858. His interest in military affairs continued in his second term. A supporter of Stephen A. Douglas in the 1860 Presidential election and strong advocate for Union, Rust shifted his position after Lincoln&#x27;s call for troops. In May 1861 Arkansas seceded from the Union, and he was named a delegate to the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States.

== American Civil War ==

Returning to Arkansas, Rust received a commission as colonel on July 5, 1861, and assisted Van H. Manning in recruiting and organizing the 3d Arkansas Infantry Regiment. The Third Arkansas would become Arkansas&#x27;s most celebrated Civil War regiment and the only Arkansas regiment to be permanently assigned to General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia. In the fall of 1861, Rust and the Third Arkansas traveled to Western Virginia and took part in the Battle of Cheat Mountain under Lee. During that winter, he and the regiment were under the command of General Stonewall Jackson. They would go on to serve in almost every major battle fought in the east, including the Battle of Gettysburg, although mostly after Rust&#x27;s promotion and transfer from the regiment.

On March 4, 1862, Rust was promoted to brigadier-general and transferred back to Arkansas, where he was assigned to Lieutenant-General Earl Van Dorn&#x27;s Army of the West. He led troops at the Battle of Hill&#x27;s Plantation in July 1862. After the Battle of Pea Ridge, most Confederate States forces were removed from Arkansas and transferred east of the Mississippi River.

Rust fought at the Battle of Corinth, Mississippi in October. In April 1863, he was once again transferred back to Arkansas and placed under Major-General Sterling Price in the Trans-Mississippi Department. He later served under Major-Generals Thomas C. Hindman in Arkansas and John Pemberton and Richard Taylor in Louisiana. After his active military service, he moved to Austin, Texas to reunite with his family, who had abandoned their home in Arkansas during the Federal occupation and spent considerable time with his brother Dr. George W. Rust in Virginia.

== Later life and death ==
After the war Rust moved from his home in El Dorado, Arkansas, across the Arkansas River from Little Rock. He returned to Washington as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives and was even a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in 1869 before Congressional Reconstruction began and former Confederates were forbidden to hold elective office and he withdrew himself from candidacy. On April 3, 1870, he died in Pulaski County, Arkansas, from a brain abscess, while his wife and children were away visiting family in Virginia. His burial place is the subject of some dispute. Contemporary accounts state that he was buried at the historic Mount Holly Cemetery in Little Rock; his old Congressional biography reports his &quot;interment in the Old Methodist Cemetery.&quot; A new Congressional Biography reports he is buried in the Oakland and Fraternal Cemetery at Little Rock.

== Personal life ==
Rust married Jane Carrington (1824-1847) of Charlotte County, Virginia, on April 17, 1844, but she soon died, and was buried in Hervey Cemetery in Hempstead County, Arkansas. He then married Anne Bouldin Cabell, and at least three of their children (raised in Virginia during the American Civil War) would survive to adulthood: Julia Rust Tutwiler (1854-1923), Breckenridge Cabell Rust (1855-1892) and author Pauline Carrington Rust Bouve (1860-1928).

<doc id="324022" wikidata="Q182904" url="?curid=324022" title="Margaret Bondfield">
<text>Margaret Grace Bondfield (17 March 1873 – 16 June 1953) was a British Labour Party politician, trade unionist and women&#x27;s rights activist. She became the first female cabinet minister, and the first woman to be a privy counsellor in the UK, when she was appointed Minister of Labour in the Labour government of 1929–31. She had earlier become the first woman to chair the General Council of the Trades Union Congress (TUC).

Bondfield was born in humble circumstances and received limited formal education. After serving an apprenticeship to an embroideress she worked as a shop assistant in Brighton and London. She was shocked by the working conditions of shop staff, particularly within the &quot;living-in&quot; system, and became an active member of the shopworkers&#x27; union. She began to move in socialist circles, and in 1898 was appointed assistant secretary of the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks (NAUSAWC). She was later prominent in several women&#x27;s socialist movements: she helped to found the Women&#x27;s Labour League (WLL) in 1906, and was chair of the Adult Suffrage Society. Her standpoint on women&#x27;s suffrage—she favoured extending the vote to all adults regardless of gender or property, rather than the limited &quot;on the same terms as men&quot; agenda pursued by the militant suffragists—divided her from the militant leadership.

After leaving her union post in 1908 Bondfield worked as organising secretary for the WLL and later as women&#x27;s officer for the National Union of General and Municipal Workers (NUGMW). She was elected to the TUC Council in 1918, and became its chairman in 1923, the year she was first elected to parliament. In the short-lived minority Labour government of 1924 she served as parliamentary secretary in the Ministry of Labour. Her term of cabinet office in 1929–31 was marked by the economic crises that beset the second Labour government. Her willingness to contemplate cuts in unemployment benefits alienated her from much of the Labour movement, although she did not follow Ramsay MacDonald into the National Government that assumed office when the Labour government fell in August 1931. Bondfield remained active in NUGMW affairs until 1938, and during the Second World War carried out investigations for the Women&#x27;s Group on Public Welfare.

== Childhood and family ==
Margaret Bondfield, known in private life as &quot;Maggie&quot;, was born on 17 March 1873 in Chard, Somerset, the tenth of eleven children, and third of four daughters born to William Bondfield and his wife Ann ( Taylor), the daughter of a Congregational minister. William Bondfield worked as a lacemaker, and had a history of political activism. As a young man he had been secretary of the Chard Political Union, a centre of local radicalism that the authorities had on occasion suppressed by military force. He had also been active in the Anti-Corn Law League of the 1840s. Entirely self-educated, he was fascinated by science and engineering, and was the co-designer of a flying machine, a prototype of the modern aircraft, that was exhibited at the Great Exhibition of 1851.

While Margaret was still an infant, William lost his job and was unable to find regular work. The family suffered hardship, with the threat of the workhouse a constant fear. Nevertheless, William and Ann did their best to ensure that their children were educated and prepared for life. Margaret was a clever child, whose skills at reciting poetry or playing piano pieces were often displayed at town events and Sunday School outings. Until the age of 13 she attended the local elementary school; she then worked for a year as a pupil-teacher (she was paid three shillings a week) in the school&#x27;s boys&#x27; department. Local employment opportunities being scarce, she left Chard in 1887, at the age of 14, to begin an apprenticeship at a draper&#x27;s shop in Hove, near Brighton.

== Early career ==
=== Shop worker ===

Bondfield joined a drapery and embroidery business in Church Road, Hove, where the young apprentices were treated as family members. Relations between customers and assistants were cordial, and Bondfield&#x27;s later recollections of this period were uniformly happy. Her apprenticeship complete, she worked as a living-in assistant in a succession of Brighton drapery stores, where she quickly encountered the realities of shop staff life: unsympathetic employers, very long hours, appalling living conditions and no privacy. Bondfield reported on her experiences of living-in: &quot;Overcrowded, insanitary conditions, poor and insufficient food were the main characteristics of this system, with an undertone of danger ... In some houses both natural and unnatural vices found a breeding ground&quot;. 

She found some relief from this environment when she was befriended by a wealthy customer, Louisa Martindale, and her daughter Hilda. The Martindales, socially conscious liberals and advocates for women&#x27;s rights, found Bondfield a willing learner, and lent her books that began her lifelong interest in labour and social questions. Bondfield described Mrs Martindale as &quot;a most vivid influence on my life ... she put me in the way of knowledge that has been of help to many score of my shop mates&quot;.

Bondfield&#x27;s brother Frank had established himself in London some years earlier as a printer and trades unionist, and in 1894, having saved £5, she decided to join him. She found London shopworking conditions no better than in Brighton, but through Frank her social and political circles widened. She became an active member of the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen, and Clerks (NUSAWC), sometimes missing church on Sundays to attend union meetings. Her political and literary education was centred on the Ideal Club, where she met Bernard Shaw, and Sidney and Beatrice Webb. Under the influence of these socialist luminaries, she joined the Fabian Society and later the Independent Labour Party (ILP).

As a shopworker, Bondfield was expected to work between 80 and 100 hours a week for 51 weeks in the year, and might be sent out late at night to check that rival shops had closed before her employer would do so. She began to record her experiences, in a series of articles and stories that she wrote under the pseudonym &quot;Grace Dare&quot;, for the shopworkers&#x27; monthly magazine &quot;The Shop Assistant&quot;. She wrote surreptitiously, at night: &quot;I would light my half-penny dip [candle], hiding its glare by means of a towel and set to work on my monthly article&quot;. 

In 1896, she was recruited by the Women&#x27;s Industrial Council (WIC) as an undercover agent, working in various shops while secretly recording every aspect of shop life. Her accounts of squalor and exploitation were published in articles under the &quot;Grace Dare&quot; name, in both &quot;The Shop Assistant&quot; and the &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot; newspaper, and provided the basis for a WIC report on shopworkers&#x27; conditions published in 1898.

=== Union official ===
In 1898, Bondfield accepted the job of assistant secretary of NUSAWC, which that year became &quot;NAUSAWC&quot; after amalgamating with the United Shop Assistants&#x27; Union. From this time onward she subordinated her life to her union work and to the wider cause of socialism. She &quot;had no vocation for wifehood or motherhood, but an urge to serve the Union ... I had &#x27;the dear love of comrades&#x27; &quot;. At the time the union&#x27;s membership, at under 3,000, represented only a small fraction of shopworkers, and Bondfield gave priority to increasing this proportion. 

For months she travelled the country, distributing literature and arranging meetings when she could, with mixed outcomes in the face of apathy from shop staff, and outright opposition from shopowners. In Reading and Bristol she reported no success, although in Gloucester, she thought, &quot;it should not be difficult to organise every shop worker&quot;. In 1899 Bondfield was the first woman delegate to the Trades Union Annual Congress, that year held in Plymouth, where she participated in the vote that led to the formation in 1900 of the Labour Representation Committee (LRC), forerunner of the Labour Party. NAUSAWC, its membership by then around 7,000, was one of the first unions to affiliate to the committee.

In 1902 Bondfield met Mary Macarthur, some eight years her junior, who chaired the Ayr branch of NAUSAWC. Macarthur, the daughter of a wealthy Scottish draper, had held staunchly Conservative views until a works meeting in 1901 to discuss the formation of a NAUSAWC branch transformed her into an ardent trades unionist. 

In 1903, Macarthur moved to London where, with Bondfield&#x27;s recommendation, she became secretary of the Women&#x27;s Trade Union League. The two became close comrades-in-arms during the next two decades, in a range of causes affecting women. The historian Lise Sanders suggests that Bondfield&#x27;s more intimate friendships tended to be with women rather than men; Bondfield&#x27;s biographer Mary Hamilton described Macarthur as the romance of Bondfield&#x27;s life.

1904 saw the passage of the Shop Hours Act, which made some provision for limiting shop opening hours. In 1907, the first steps were taken to end the Victorian &quot;living-in&quot; practice, which at the time still affected two-thirds of Britain&#x27;s 750,000 shopworkers. Initially, living-out privileges were only given to male employees; Bondfield campaigned for equivalent rights for women shop workers, arguing that if they were to become &quot;useful, healthy ... wives and mothers&quot;, they needed to live &quot;rational lives&quot;. As part of her campaign, Bondfield advised the playwright Cicely Hamilton, whose shop-based drama &quot;Diana of Dobsons&quot; appeared that year. Bondfield described the opening scene, set in a dreary, comfortless women&#x27;s dormitory over a shop, as very like the real thing.

From 1904 onwards, Bondfield was increasingly occupied with the issue of women&#x27;s suffrage. In that year she travelled with Dora Montefiore of the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union (WSPU) to the International Congress of Women in Berlin, but she was not in sympathy with the main WSPU policy, which was to secure the vote for women on the same highly restricted basis that it was then given to men. This involved a property qualification, and thus largely excluded the working class. Bondfield saw no benefit in this policy to the women that she represented, and aligned herself with the Adult Suffrage Society (ASS), which campaigned for universal adult suffrage, men and women alike, regardless of property. In 1906, she became chairman of the society and supported the Franchise and Removal of Women&#x27;s Disabilities bill, introduced to parliament by Sir Charles Dilke. This proposed full adult suffrage, and the right of women to become MPs. The bill was &quot;talked out&quot; in the House of Commons.

In 1907, in the course of a public debate with Teresa Billington-Greig of the Women&#x27;s Freedom League (a breakaway group from the WSPU), Bondfield argued that the only way forward was a bill that enfranchised all men and all women, without qualification. She wished good luck to those fighting for a &quot;same terms as men&quot; suffrage bill, but &quot;don&#x27;t let them come and tell me that they are working for my class&quot;. The strains of her duties and constant campaigning began to undermine her health, and in 1908 she resigned her union post after ten years&#x27; service, during which NAUSAWC membership had risen to over 20,000. Her departure, she said, was &quot;alike a grief and a deliverance&quot;. After the passing of the Representation of the People&#x27;s Act 1918, giving some women the vote, Bondfield&#x27;s answer to &quot;Are Women MPs necessary?&quot; was 

We shall never reach a satisfactory State until we have the recognition of the citizen irrespective of sex.

== Women&#x27;s Labour League ==
After leaving NAUSAWC, Bondfield transferred the main focus of her energies to the Women&#x27;s Labour League (WLL), which she had helped to found in 1906. The League&#x27;s principal aims were &quot;to work for independent labour representation in connection with the Labour Party, and to obtain direct labour representation of women in Parliament and on all local bodies.&quot; The president of the League was Margaret MacDonald, wife of the future Labour Party leader Ramsay MacDonald; Bondfield had known the MacDonalds since the 1890s, through their joint work for the WIC.

With a government suffrage reform bill pending in parliament, the WLL introduced a motion to the 1909 Labour Party conference committing the party to oppose any suffrage extension bill that did not specifically include women. However, while the party was largely sympathetic to the principle of women&#x27;s suffrage, it was unwilling to risk losing the limited reforms to male suffrage promised by the government&#x27;s bill. When Bondfield tabled the WLL motion at the Labour conference, she was persuaded by Arthur Henderson to water it down. Many suffragists reacted angrily; the WSPU accused the WLL, and Bondfield in particular, of treachery. Fran Abrams, in a biographical essay, writes that although Bondfield &quot;was prepared to argue loud and long for adult suffrage, ... she was not prepared to damage her relationship with the Labour Party for it&quot;.

Since the passing of the Qualification of Women Act in 1907, women had been eligible to vote in and stand as candidates in municipal elections. Several WLL members contested the London County Council elections in 1910; Bondfield stood in Woolwich, unsuccessfully (she contested the same seat in 1913, with a similar result). The League was active in all types of elections, supporting and canvassing for candidates of either sex who spoke out for women&#x27;s rights. Through these activities Bondfield experienced the lives of the poorest of families, writing: &quot;Oh! the lonely lives of these women, hidden away at the back of a network of small, mean streets!&quot;

Alongside her WLL duties, Bondfield maintained a range of other involvements. She spent part of 1910 in the United States, lecturing on suffrage issues with Maud Ward of the People&#x27;s Suffrage Federation (PSF), and studying labour problems. At home, she worked with the Women&#x27;s Co-operative Guild (WCG) on maternity and child welfare, and was co-opted to the Parliamentary Standing Committee that piloted the introduction of state maternity benefits and other assistance to mothers. Her investigation on behalf of the WIC into the working conditions in the textile industries led her to join most of the Labour leadership in a &quot;War against Poverty&quot; campaign. In 1910, Bondfield accepted the chairmanship of the British section of the Women&#x27;s International Council of Socialist and Labour Organisations.

Between 1908 and 1910 the WLL and the WIC co-operated in a nationwide investigation of married women&#x27;s working conditions. Bondfield carried out the fieldwork in Yorkshire. The relationship between the two bodies was sometimes fractious, and when the report was due to be published, there were disagreements over how it should be handled. As a result of these and other clashes, Bondfield, MacDonald and the other League women resigned from the Council. In 1911 Bondfield assumed the role of the WLL&#x27;s Organising Secretary, and spent much of the year travelling: she formed a WLL branch in Ogmore Vale, Glamorgan, reformed the Manchester branch, and found time to advise laundrywomen engaged in a dispute in South Wales. 

The sudden death of Mary MacDonald in September 1911 added considerably to Bondfield&#x27;s workload; the strain, together with internal animosities within the WLL, led her to resign her position in January 1912. The League made strenuous efforts to retain her, and only in September did its committee reluctantly accept her departure. An attempt to re-engage her in 1913 was unsuccessful, and Marion Phillips was appointed to succeed her.

== Campaigns and war ==
From 1912 Bondfield was a member of the WCG&#x27;s Citizenship Subcommittee, where she worked with Margaret Llewelyn Davies investigating minimum wage rates, infant mortality and child welfare. She also assisted the Guild&#x27;s education and training programme, lecturing on &quot;Local Government in Relation to Maternity&quot;. Freedom from her WLL responsibilities gave her more time for political work, and in 1913 she joined the ILP&#x27;s National Administration Council. 

Bondfield spoke at the ILP&#x27;s mass anti-war rally in Trafalgar Square on 2 August 1914, organised by George Lansbury; other speakers included Keir Hardie, Henderson, and the dockers&#x27; leader Ben Tillett. On the outbreak of war a few days later, Bondfield joined the Union of Democratic Control that, while not pacifist, opposed the use of war as an instrument of national policy. She was a member of the Women&#x27;s Peace Council. In March 1915 she attended a conference in Bern, Switzerland, organised by the Women&#x27;s International of Socialist and Labour Organizations, which called for a negotiated peace. Later in the war the government, concerned by Bondfield&#x27;s association with peace organisations, prevented her from travelling to similar gatherings in Sweden and the United States.

Bondfield had helped Mary Macarthur to found the National Federation of Women Workers (NFWW) in 1906. This organisation was dedicated to the unionisation of women, and by 1914 had more than 20,000 members. In 1915 Bondfield became NFWW&#x27;s organising secretary. Together with Macarthur, Phillips and Susan Lawrence, she established the Central Committee for Women&#x27;s Employment, which organised relief work for the female unemployed. Bondfield&#x27;s investigations into workers&#x27; pay revealed considerable differences between the rates paid to men and to women, even for identical work. Through the NFWW she campaigned for a £1 a week starting minimum wage for women, whatever the nature of the work, and for equal pay with men for equal work.

Suffragist militancy having largely lapsed after the outbreak of the First World War, in October 1916 a Speaker&#x27;s Conference was convened to consider the issue of women&#x27;s franchise and make proposals for postwar legislation. While Bondfield, Lansbury and other prewar campaigners pressed for universal adult suffrage, the conference recommended only a limited extension of the franchise. The subsequent Representation of the People Act, 1918, gave the vote to women over 30 who were property owners or the wives of property owners, or were university graduates. Bondfield described the Act, which excluded almost all working-class women, as &quot;mean and inadequate ... creating fresh anomalies&quot;.

== National prominence ==
The end of the war in November 1918 saw Bondfield&#x27;s election to the General Council of the TUC, the first woman to be thus elevated. In the following months she travelled as a TUC delegate to international conferences, in Bern and later in Washington DC, where she expressed the view that the peace terms being imposed on Germany were unjust. In April 1920, she was a member of a joint TUC-Labour Party mission to the Soviet Union. A few months earlier, Lansbury had visited the incipient Soviet state and had been most impressed after meeting Lenin, whom he judged to be &quot;symbolic of a new spirit&quot;, &quot;the father of his people&quot; and &quot;their champion in the cause of social and economic freedom&quot;. Bondfield, who also met Lenin, was more cautious. She told an NFWW conference on her return that if she were a Russian citizen she would support the Bolshevist government as currently &quot;the only possible form of administration&quot;. Later, she came to see communism as anti-democratic and dictatorial, and voted against the application of the British Communist Party for affiliation to the Labour Party.

Among various public activities, Bondfield joined the governing body of Ruskin College, the Oxford-based institution founded in 1899 to provide higher education opportunities to working-class men. She also became a Justice of the Peace. She first sought election to parliament in 1920, as the Labour candidate in a by-election in Northampton. She increased the Labour vote significantly, but lost by 3,371 votes, to the Coalition Liberal candidate. 

At the general election of 1922 she was again adopted by Labour at Northampton and, as she had at Woolwich in 1913, turned to Shaw for help in the campaign. He was contemptuous of the Labour leadership for not arranging a more promising seat; nevertheless, he came and spoke for her, but her margin of defeat widened to 5,476.

Following two years of negotiation, in 1920 the NFWW voted to merge with the National Union of General Workers and become that union&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Section. Bondfield, who supported the merger, believed that provided women could maintain their separate group identity, it was better for men and women to work together. The secretary of the new section was to have been Mary Macarthur, but she died of cancer on 1 January 1921, the date that the merger came into effect. Bondfield was appointed in her place, and remained in the post (with leave of absence while holding ministerial office) until 1938. To honour her friend, Bondfield helped to organise the Mary Macarthur Memorial Fund. She added other responsibilities to her heavy schedule: chairing the Standing Joint Committee of Industrial Women&#x27;s Organisations (SJCIWO), membership of the Labour Party&#x27;s Emergency Committee on Unemployment, and chairman of the 1922 Conference of Unemployed Women. In September 1923, she became the first woman to assume the chair of the TUC&#x27;s General Council.

Hoping to win a mandate for tariffs on imported goods, the Conservative Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin called a general election in December 1923. Bondfield was elected in Northampton with a majority of 4,306 over her Conservative opponent. She was one of the first three women—Susan Lawrence and Dorothy Jewson were the others—to be elected as Labour MPs. In an outburst of local celebration her supporters, whom she described as &quot;nearly crazy with joy&quot;, paraded her around the town in a charabanc. The Labour Party had won 191 seats to the Conservatives&#x27; 258 and the Liberals&#x27; 158; with no party in possession of a parliamentary majority, the make-up of the next government was in doubt for several weeks.

== Parliament and office ==
=== First Labour Government ===

The Liberal Party&#x27;s decision not to enter a coalition with the Conservatives, and Baldwin&#x27;s unwillingness to govern without a majority, led to Ramsay MacDonald&#x27;s first minority Labour government which took office in January 1924. According to Lansbury&#x27;s biographer, Bondfield turned down the offer of a cabinet post; instead, she became parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Labour, Tom Shaw. This appointment meant that she had to give up the TUC Council chair; her decision to do so, immediately after becoming the first woman to achieve this honour, generated some criticism from other trade unionists.

Bondfield later described her first months in government as &quot;a strange adventure&quot;. The difficulties of the economic situation would have created problems for the most experienced of governments, and the fledgling Labour administration was quickly in difficulties.

Bondfield spent much of her time abroad; in the autumn she travelled to Canada as the head of a delegation examining the problems of British immigrants, especially as related to the welfare of young children. When she returned to Britain in early October she found the government in its final throes. On 8 October, MacDonald resigned after losing a confidence vote in the House of Commons. Labour&#x27;s chances of victory in the ensuing general election were fatally compromised by the controversy surrounding the so-called Zinoviev letter, a missive purportedly sent by Grigory Zinoviev, president of the Communist International, which called on Britain&#x27;s socialists to prepare for violent revolution. The letter, published four days before polling day, generated a &quot;Red Scare&quot; that led to a significant swing of voters to the right, and ensured a massive Conservative victory. Bondfield lost her seat in Northampton by 971 votes.

=== Opposition ===
After her defeat, Bondfield resumed her work for NUGMW and was re-elected to the TUC Council. In 1926 she supported the TUC&#x27;s decision to hold a General Strike, and also the decision to call it off after nine days. Following the resignation of Sir Patrick Hastings in June 1926, Bondfield was adopted as the Labour candidate at Wallsend, and won the subsequent by-election with a majority of over 9,000. Meanwhile, she had accepted appointment to the Blanesburgh Committee, which the Conservative government had set up to consider reforms to the system of unemployment benefit. Her private view, that entitlement to benefits should be related to contributions, was not widely shared in the Labour Party or the TUC. When the committee made recommendations along these lines she signed the report, which became the basis of the Unemployment Insurance Act 1927. Bondfield&#x27;s association with this legislation permanently shadowed her relationship with the Labour movement.

On 29 March 1928, when a bill came before parliament giving the vote in parliamentary elections to all men and women over 21, she termed the measure &quot;a tremendous social advance&quot;, and added: &quot;At last [women] are established on that equitable footing because we are human beings and part of society as a whole ... once and for all, we shall destroy the artificial barrier in the way of any women who want to get education in politics and who want to come forward and take their full share in the political life of their day&quot;. The bill passed into law as the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928, adding 4 million voters, most of them women, to the register. In the 1929 general election, held on 30 May, Bondfield easily held her Wallsend seat despite the intervention of a candidate representing unemployed workers. The overall election result left Labour as the largest party with 287 seats, but without an overall majority, and MacDonald formed his second minority administration.

=== Minister of Labour ===
When Bondfield accepted the post of Minister of Labour in the new government, she became Britain&#x27;s first woman cabinet minister, and Britain&#x27;s first woman privy counsellor. She considered the appointment &quot;part of the great revolution in the position of women&quot;. Her period in office was dominated by the issue of rising unemployment and the consequent increasing costs of benefit, which created a division between the government, anxious to demonstrate its financial responsibility, and the wider Labour movement whose priority was to protect the unemployed. According to the historian Robert Skidelsky: &quot;Ministers worried about the finances of the [unemployment] fund; backbenchers worried about the finances of the unemployed&quot;. Under increasing pressure from the TUC, Bondfield introduced a bill that reversed the &quot;Blanesburgh&quot; restrictions on unemployment benefit introduced by the previous government, but with visible reluctance. Her handling of this issue is described by Marquand as &quot;maladroit&quot;, and by Skidelsky as showing &quot;monumental tactlessness&quot;.

As the cost of unemployment benefits mounted, Bondfield&#x27;s attempts to control the fund&#x27;s deficit provoked further hostility from the TUC and political attacks from the opposition parties. In February 1931 she proposed a scheme to cut benefit and restrict entitlement, but this was rejected by the cabinet as too harsh. Instead, seeking a cross-party solution, the government accepted a Liberal proposal for an independent committee, eventually set up under Sir George May, to report on how public expenditure might be reduced. With the collapse in May 1931 of Austria&#x27;s leading private bank, Kreditanstalt, and the subsequent failure of several other European banks, the sense of crisis deepened. On 30 July, the May committee recommended cuts in expenditure of £97 million, the majority (£67 million) to be found from reductions in unemployment costs. In the ensuing weeks, ministers struggled vainly to meet these demands. Bondfield was prepared to cut general unemployment benefit, provided the most needy recipients—those on so-called &quot;transitional benefit&quot;—were protected. No formula could be found; by 23 August the cabinet was hopelessly split, and resigned the next day. To the outrage of the TUC and most of the Labour Party, MacDonald formed an emergency National Government with the Conservative and Liberal parties, while the bulk of the Labour Party went into opposition.

Bondfield did not join the small number of Labour MPs who chose to follow MacDonald, although she expressed her &quot;deep sympathy and admiration&quot; for his actions. In the general election that followed on 27 October 1931, the Labour Party lost more than three-quarters of its Commons seats and was reduced to 52 members. Bondfield was defeated in Wallsend by 7,606 votes; Abrams observes that given the attacks on her from both right and left, &quot;it would have been a miracle had she been re-elected&quot;. Of the former Labour cabinet members who opposed the National Government, only Lansbury kept his seat.

== Later career ==
After her defeat, Bondfield returned to her NUGMW post. The TUC, suspicious of her perceived closeness to MacDonald, was cool towards her and she was not re-elected to the General Council. She remained Labour&#x27;s candidate at Wallsend; in the general election of 1935 she was again defeated. She never returned to parliament; she was adopted as the prospective Labour candidate for Reading, but when it became obvious that the election due for 1940 would be delayed indefinitely by war, she resigned her candidacy.

In 1938, after retiring from her NUGMW post, Bondfield founded the Women&#x27;s Group on Public Welfare. She studied labour conditions in the United States and Mexico during 1938, and toured the US and Canada after the outbreak of war in 1939, as a lecturer for the British Information Services. Her attitude towards the war was different from her semi-pacifist stance of 1914; she actively supported the government and, in 1941, published a booklet, &quot;Why Labour Fights&quot;. Her main wartime activity was leading an investigation by the Hygiene Committee of the Women&#x27;s Group on Public Welfare, into the problems that arose from the large-scale evacuation into the countryside of city children. The group&#x27;s findings were published in 1943, as &quot;Our Towns: a Close-up&quot;; the report gave many people their first understanding of the extent of inner-city poverty. 

Suggested solutions included nursery education, a minimum wage, child allowances and a national health service. The report was reprinted several times, and was instrumental in developing support for the social reforms introduced by the Labour government that took office in 1945. Among Bondfield&#x27;s other wartime activities, in 1944 she helped to launch a national drive for the appointment of more women police officers.

== Last years, retirement and death ==
Although not a candidate herself, Bondfield campaigned for Labour in the general election of July 1945—a reporter found her instructing a meeting in Bury St Edmunds on the benefits of nationalisation. She was active in her local Labour Party, and continued to chair the Women&#x27;s Group of Public Welfare until 1948. Her main task in these years was her autobiography, published in 1948 under the title &quot;A Life&#x27;s Work&quot;. The purpose of the book, she wrote, was not to celebrate her own achievements, instead she hoped that her experiences &quot;may be of some service to the younger generation&quot;. The book had an indifferent reception; in &quot;The Observer&quot;, Harold Nicolson described it as &quot;ill composed and badly proportioned&quot;, with too much space devoted to inconsequential meetings while truly important events were hurried over. Nevertheless, he thought the book provided &quot;a fine example of resolute and in the end triumphant energy&quot;. &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;″s reviewer also criticised the work&#x27;s confused structure and unselective detail, but found it &quot;a useful, direct and honest&quot; account of Labour&#x27;s early years.

Apart from her autobiography, Bondfield contributed to a collection of essays entitled &quot;What Life Has Taught Me&quot;, in which 25 public figures pondered on the lessons of life. Bondfield wrote that her religious convictions gave her &quot;strength to meet defeat with a smile, to face success with a sense of responsibility; to be willing to do one&#x27;s best without hope of reward [and] to bear misrepresentation without giving way to futile bitterness&quot;. 

In March 1948, Bondfield opened the Mary Macarthur Home at Poulton-le-Fylde, near Blackpool in Lancashire, which provided subsidised holidays for low-paid women workers. In 1949, she made a six-month speaking tour of the United States, her final visit to the country; she left convinced that America would soon adopt a national health service.

Bondfield, who never married, maintained her good health and interest in life until her final illness in 1953. She moved to a nursing home in Sanderstead, Surrey, where she died, aged 80, on 16 June 1953. At her cremation in Golders Green Crematorium the congregation sang the popular hymn &quot;To Be a Pilgrim&quot;. The Labour Party was fully represented; Clement Attlee, then-Leader of the Labour Party and former UK Prime Minister, gave the address.

== Appraisal and legacy ==
In his biographical sketch for the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, Philip Williamson depicts Bondfield as &quot;physically short and stout ... with sparkling eyes, a firm, brisk manner, and effective, sometimes inspired, public speaking&quot;. She had the self-confidence to exist and thrive in a male-dominated world, deriving inspiration from a childhood that, though materially impoverished, her obituarist has described as &quot;of great spiritual and mental wealth&quot;. She inherited a strong nonconformist faith, which became a key element throughout her later career, and retained her links with the Congregational Church throughout her life. After her death &quot;The Times&quot; praised her &quot;unusually wide human sympathies ... her generous nature and real sense of humour&quot;. Skidelsky, however, describes her unsympathetically as &quot;a humourless and somewhat priggish person, with long black skirts and a voice that emitted a harsh cascade of sound&quot;. A more recent and sympathetic account of her life by Tony Judge sets her career more in the context of her championing of women&#x27;s political and workplace rights, and her role in the 1931 crisis more as a hapless victim of MacDonald&#x27;s machinations.

Bondfield&#x27;s career was punctuated by &quot;firsts&quot;, in union, parliament and government spheres. Her own view of these achievements was modest: &quot;Some woman was bound to be first. That I should be was the accident of dates and events&quot;. Her appointment as Minister of Labour propelled her into what was, in 1929, the hardest job in the cabinet, and in common with other ministers, her lack of experience in government left her heavily dependent on her official advisers. By temperament a realist, she based her actions in government on economic facts rather on party or sectional interests; thus she became &quot;caught between the opposition claims that she was soft on the unemployed, and her own backbenchers&#x27; jibe that she had abandoned the workers&quot;. Her stance, and her seemingly equivocal attitude towards MacDonald&#x27;s apostasy, reduced her standing in her own party for decades, so that when Barbara Castle was appointed as Minister of Labour by Harold Wilson in 1968, she insisted that the ministry&#x27;s name be changed to &quot;Department of Employment&quot;, for fear of association with Bondfield&#x27;s term in office. Castle refused to contribute a preface to a Fabian Society booklet celebrating Bondfield&#x27;s life, because she considered her predecessor&#x27;s actions close to political betrayal. In 2001, a speech by Tony Blair celebrating the Labour Party&#x27;s 100 years in parliament paid tributes to many heroes of the movement&#x27;s early years; Bondfield&#x27;s name was not mentioned.

Bondfield was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree by the University of Bristol, and in 1930 received the freedom of the borough from her home town of Chard, where in 2011 a plaque in her honour was fixed to the Guildhall wall. In 1948 she was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH). Many years after her death, streets and apartment buildings were named after her in the London boroughs of Tower Hamlets, Barking; and Islington, small block of flats built to replace the house lived in by Dr H.H Crippen, destroyed by German bomb in 1940. She was further commemorated in her old constituency of Northampton when a hall of residence in the University of Northampton was named the Margaret Bondfield Hall. In 2014 a campaign began for a plaque on the shop in Church Street, Hove, where in 1886–87 Bondfield had served her apprenticeship.

To mark Bondfield&#x27;s centenary in 1973, Linda Christmas in &quot;The Guardian&quot; reviewed the progress of women in parliament since the 1930s. By 1973, Christmas reported, only 93 women had sat in parliament; their contributions had overall &quot;not been stunning&quot;. Their best numerical representation at that point had been in the 1966 general election, when 29 women (out of 630 MPs) had been elected. The 1979 election saw this number fall to 19, but also saw Margaret Thatcher become Britain&#x27;s first woman prime minister. Cox and Hobley draw attention to Thatcher&#x27;s early life as a shopkeeper&#x27;s daughter, and contrast her account of those days with Bondfield&#x27;s experiences half a century earlier. Thatcher believed that the concept of service to the customer was absolute; thus, Cox and Hobley assert, she would have had little sympathy for Bondfield&#x27;s campaigns to better shopworkers&#x27; conditions. Despite the changes that have taken place in the retail industry since Bondfield&#x27;s day, Cox and Hobley believe that, were she alive, &quot;she&#x27;d still be champing at the bit, trying to coax shop assistants to join a union, and fiercely championing shopworkers&#x27; rights to better pay and conditions&quot;.

<doc id="324024" wikidata="Q7942156" url="?curid=324024" title="Voter fatigue">
<text>In political science, voter fatigue is a cause of voter abstention which result from the electorates of representative democracies being asked to vote often, on too many issues or without easy access to relevant information. Voter fatigue can be a symptom of efforts that make voting more difficult that some describe as voter suppression, which changes the voting rules and environment in such a way that turnout decreases as the cost of voting increases.

== Causes ==

According to the traditional understanding of the concept, voter fatigue arises when citizens are asked to vote frequently or fill out lengthy ballots. Voter fatigue can be contributed to by a psychological phenomenon known as decision fatigue. As this suggests, our brain becomes mentally fatigued after making numerous decisions, so it will attempt to make shortcuts to decrease the workload. As decision fatigue increases, more voters abstain. This can result in lower voter turnout rates.

The process of voting can also be confusing or challenging. In the U.S., the Cost of Voting Index estimates how difficult it is to vote (and register to vote) in each state. The index doesn&#x27;t include other challenges like voter roll purges or such if signature verification standards are so strict that they throw out many more valid votes than invalid ones, with some states requiring residents to &#x27;cure&#x27; their ballots by re-signing.

== Combating voter fatigue ==
Some of the methods proposed to combat voter fatigue include:

* Consolidate the number of elections, especially off-year elections.
* Guard against long and complex ballots.
* Use sortition (e.g. citizens&#x27; juries) instead of elections for some decisions.
* Make voting easier, including the process of finding civic information.
* Experiment with incorporating aspects of E-democracy, proxy voting and delegated voting.

==Examples==
In the run-up to the 2019 UK General Election, it was suggested by some media outlets that the electorate might be altered by abstention from voter fatigue from the third General Election in little over 4 years, having seen one in 2015 and the snap election of 2017, either side of the 2016 EU Membership Referendum.

In Israel, five snap elections from 2019-2022 has led to concerns about voter fatigue.

Amid the 2021–present Bulgarian political crisis, reports by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, &quot;Balkan Insight&quot;, and &quot;Euronews&quot; described the voter fatigue faced by Bulgarian voters having to vote six times in three years.

<doc id="324025" wikidata="Q1469596" url="?curid=324025" title="National Republican Movement">
<text>The National Republican Movement (&quot;Mouvement national républicain&quot; or MNR) is a French nationalist political party, created by Bruno Mégret with former Club de l&#x27;Horloge members Yvan Blot (also a member of GRECE) and Jean-Yves Le Gallou, as a split from Jean-Marie Le Pen&#x27;s National Front on 24 January 1999.

Mégret has tried in the past to distance himself from Le Pen&#x27;s provocative statements, in particular concerning Holocaust denial. In 2001, a call for reconciliation between the two parties was endorsed by Roland Gaucher.

==History==
Initially, Bruno Mégret was the chairman, with Serge Martinez vice-chairman, Jean-Yves Le Gallou, executive director and Franck Timmermans secretary-general. Other notable members of the party included Jean Haudry, Pierre Vial, Jean-Claude Bardet, Xavier Guillemot, Christian Bouchet and Maxime Brunerie. In 2000, the party had fewer than 5000 members, while its youth movement, the Movement National de la Jeunesse, headed by Philippe Schleiter, nephew of Robert Faurisson, had 1500 members. The student union Renouveau Etudiant had close ties with the MNR thanks to Pierre Vial. The party was initially known as the Front National-Mouvement National, but was forced to change its name to Mouvement National Républicain on 2 October 1999 after being sued by Le Pen for trademark infringement.

In 2000, via the organisation &quot;Promouvoir&quot;, the MNR sued successfully for the ban of the film &quot;Baise-moi&quot; to minors. Pierre Vial left the MNR in October 2001, Bruno Mégret having expressed solidarity with the US after the 11 September 2001 attack on the World Trade Center. During the 2004 campaign for the regional elections, the MNR campaigned under the &quot;No to Islamisation&quot; slogan. In 2005, it campaigned against the proposed European Constitution and the possible accession of Turkey to the European Union; Bruno Mégret said that the Europeans, including France, were lying to the Turks by having them believe they could integrate within the EU, whereas public opinion would surely reject Turkey&#x27;s membership in a referendum. As a result of MNR&#x27;s poor electoral results, Franck Timmermans and a few other former MNR members formed a new party in 2005, called the Parti populiste (Populist Party, PP) which gravitated back towards the &quot;Front national&quot; (Timmermans will later join &quot;Front national&#x27;s&quot; cantonal campaign by representing it in Saint-Nazaire, as other candidates in Northern France in March 2008).

As the &quot;Front national&quot; organised its traditional 1 May rally in Paris, to honour the memory of Joan of Arc, its president Jean-Marie Le Pen explicitly called for a union of all patriots, in the context of the approaching French presidential election of 2007. MNR, &quot;via&quot; Bruno Mégret, responded positively to this proposition, as did the &quot;Parti populiste&quot;. The &quot;Union des patriotes&quot; (Union of Patriots) was officially launched on 20 December 2006 by a symbolic reconciliation in Le Pen Montretout&#x27;s mansion in Saint-Cloud, where both Le Pen and Mégret presented the initiative to the press, alongside their respective wives. The fundamental target for the MNR was to secure the support of some 140 signatures from great electors for Jean-Marie Le Pen&#x27;s presidential candidacy, of the total of 500 required. In the end, the MNR could only collect 45 signatures.

&quot;Front national&quot; and &quot;Mouvement national républicain&quot; organised separate campaigns with their respective activists in favour of Jean-Marie Le Pen&#x27;s candidacy, with the exception of a major &quot;Front national&quot; rally in Lyon on 11 March 2007 where Mégret made an appearance among the guests, although he did not speak from the platform). As a result, Mégret regularly criticised this situation, like during appearances on French television channels &quot;LCI&quot; and &quot;I&gt;télé&quot;, where he criticises what he considered to be a strategy pursued by &quot;Front national&quot; general secretary Louis Aliot, and especially Marine Le Pen, intended to downplay the contribution and the efficiency of the &quot;Union des patriotes&quot;.

On 6 March 2008, Jean-Marie Le Pen claimed that the MNR was funded illegally by the UIMM, the steel industry branch of the Medef. Bruno Mégret denied these accusations, and counter-claimed that it was foolish for Jean Marie Le Pen to make such claims, as he has been already alleged to be funded by Saddam Hussein and the Unification Church of Sun Myung Moon. In an interview to France 2 on the same day, Le Pen clarified that he had not claimed Bruno Mégret was personally receiving funds from UIMM.

Later in 2008, Bruno Mégret stepped down from party leadership and retired from political life.

==Electoral results==
*1999 European Parliament election: Bruno Mégret&#x27;s list gets 578,774 votes (3.28%) but fails to win seats in the EU Parliament.
*2002 French presidential election: Bruno Mégret wins 2.33% of the popular vote.
*2002 French legislative elections: the MNR run 572 candidates across France getting 276,376 votes and 1.09% of the popular vote. No MNR candidate will be elected during this election.
*2004 regional elections: the MNR runs candidates in 13 of the 22 metropolitan Regions of France. The best result obtained by the party is Alain Vauzelle&#x27;s 2.95% in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur.
*2004 European Parliament election: the MNR gets low results with an average of 0.31%.
*2007 French Presidential election: Bruno Mégret and the MNR support the National Front (FN) candidate, Jean-Marie Le Pen.
*2007 French legislative elections: Bruno Mégret calls for a &quot;patriotic alliance&quot; grouping all the far-right parties. Nevertheless, neither the FN nor the Movement for France (MPF) will positively respond to his idea. Finally, the MNR ran 379 candidates across France and, in the areas without any MNR candidate, the party supported FN candidates such as Bruno Gollnisch, in Lyon&#x27;s eastern suburbs. The MNR candidates, who ran under the slogan &quot;Against Immigration, Islamisation and Insecurity&quot;, only gathered 00.39% of the popular vote and were all eliminated. Mégret himself was in competition against a &quot;Front national&#x27;s&quot; candidate in the 12th circonscription of Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur (Vitrolles-Marignane), Gérald Gerin, Jean-Marie Le Pen&#x27;s own majordome : Mégret gathering 02.25% of the vote and Gerin 07.50%.

<text>James Montgomery Beck (July 9, 1861 – April 12, 1936) was an American lawyer, politician, and author from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was a member of the Republican Party, who served as U.S. Solicitor General and U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania.

==Early life and education==
Beck was born July 9, 1861, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Margaretta C. (née Darling) and James Nathan Beck. In 1880, he graduated from Moravian College in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. He was employed as clerk for a railway company in 1880 and studied law at night, was admitted to the bar in 1884 and commenced practice in Philadelphia. He was admitted to the bar of New York City in 1903, and to the bar of England in 1922.

== Career ==
Beck served as assistant United States Attorney for the eastern district of Pennsylvania from 1888 to 1892 and as United States attorney in Philadelphia from 1896 to 1900. In 1898, he ran for District Attorney of Philadelphia, but lost to P. Frederick Rothermel. Switching from a Pro-Cleveland Democrat to a Republican in 1900, he was appointed by President William McKinley as Assistant Attorney General of the U.S. at the U.S. Department of Justice in the same year, where he served until his resignation in 1903. He then returned to the full-time practice of law, joining the firm of Shearman &amp; Sterling in New York City. In 1917, he left that firm to become senior partner in Beck, Crawford &amp; Harris, and retired from active practice in 1927 to run for Congress from Philadelphia.

At the outbreak of World War I, he took a strong stand against the German Empire in extensive writings and addresses.
He was elected a bencher of Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1914, the first foreigner in 600 years to receive that distinction. He also received decorations from France and Belgium and authored several books and articles on World War I and on the Constitution of the United States. Among his books are &quot;The Evidence in the Case&quot; (1914) and &quot;War and Humanity&quot; (1916).

Beck was an elected member of the American Philosophical Society (1926).

=== Solicitor General ===
He was appointed by President Warren G. Harding as Solicitor General of the United States in 1921 and served until his voluntary resignation in 1925, when he again resumed the practice of law. During his term as solicitor general, he had charge of more than 800 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. He personally and successfully argued more than 100 of these cases, including &quot;Ozawa v. United States&quot;.

His conservative views are reflected in his 1924 book &quot;The Constitution of the United States&quot;, which was a best-seller and went through seven printings in ten months. A special edition of 10,000 copies, with a foreword written by President-elect Calvin Coolidge, was distributed to schools and libraries across the country.

=== U.S. Representative ===
After resigning as solicitor general, Beck became involved in the legal fight of William S. Vare, who was elected to the U.S. Senate but denied a seat because of irregularities in the election. In response, Beck wrote &quot;The Vanishing Rights of States&quot; in which he argued that the U.S. Constitution did not permit the U.S. Senate to exclude a member chosen through an election. The debate that followed the book&#x27;s publishing, raising Beck&#x27;s public profile and making him a prominent option to fill the U.S. House seat vacated by the resignation of James M. Hazlett.

Beck was elected to the Seventieth Congress, was reelected to the Seventy-first, Seventy-second, and Seventy-third Congresses and served from November 8, 1927, until his resignation on September 30, 1934.

He was active in the movement to repeal the Eighteenth Amendment, which he said had no place in the constitution. He also fended off legal questions about his official residence and thus eligibility to represent Philadelphia.

=== Legal battles ===
Beck resigned his seat in the House of Representatives over strong objections to President Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal. In a statement released at the time of his resignation, he stated that Congress had become &quot;merely a rubber stamp for the Executive.&quot;

He joined the lawsuit against the New Deal-created Tennessee Valley Authority and argued the case in the Supreme Court in December 1935, declaring the organization unconstitutional and socialistic. In the final weeks before his death, he served as counsel in the case of an oil stock dealer accused of violating the Securities Act of 1933.

== Personal life ==
Beck was married to Lilla Lawrence Mitchell (1861–1956), the daughter of James and Emeline Lawrence Mitchell of Philadelphia and later of Baltimore. They had two children together:

* James Montgomery Beck Jr. (1892–1972) who married The Hon. Clarissa &quot;Clare&quot; Tennant (1896–1960), a daughter of Edward Tennant, 1st Baron Glenconner and the former Pamela Wyndham. After their divorce, he married Mary Ridgely Carter.
* Beatrice Beck (1897–1980), who married foreign service officer Somerville Pinkney Tuck in 1924. After their 1934 divorce, she married Snowden Andrews Fahnestock (a grandson of banker Harris C. Fahnestock), in 1936.

==Death==
Beck died April 12, 1936, in Washington, D.C., at age 74, and is buried at Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C. Beck&#x27;s widow, Lilla Lawrence Mitchell, died over 20 years later, on August 1, 1956.

<text>The Office for National Statistics (ONS; ) is the executive office of the UK Statistics Authority, a non-ministerial department which reports directly to the UK Parliament.

== Overview ==
The ONS is responsible for the collection and publication of statistics related to the economy, population and society of the United Kingdom; responsibility for some areas of statistics in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales is devolved to the devolved governments for those areas. The ONS functions as the executive office of the National Statistician, who is also the UK Statistics Authority&#x27;s Chief Executive and principal statistical adviser to the UK&#x27;s National Statistics Institute, and the &#x27;Head Office&#x27; of the Government Statistical Service (GSS). Its main office is in Newport near the United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office and Tredegar House, but another significant office is in Titchfield in Hampshire, and a small office is in London. ONS co-ordinates data collection with the respective bodies in Northern Ireland and Scotland, namely NISRA and NRS.

== History ==
The ONS was formed on 1 April 1996 by the merger of the Central Statistical Office (CSO) and the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS). Following the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007, the United Kingdom Statistics Authority became a non-ministerial department on 1 April 2008.

== Purpose and scope ==
ONS produces and publishes a wide range of the information about the United Kingdom that can be used for social and economic policy-making as well as painting a portrait of the country as its population evolves over time. This is often produced in ways that make comparison with other societies and economies possible. Much of the data on which policy-makers depend is produced by ONS through a combination of a decennial population census, samples and surveys and analysis of data generated by businesses and organisations such as the National Health Service and the register of births, marriages and deaths. Its publications, and analyses by other users based on its published data, are reported and discussed daily in the media as the basis for the public understanding of the country in which they live.

=== Applications of data ===
The reliance on some of these data by government (both local and national) makes ONS material central to debates about the determination of priorities, the allocation of resources and for decisions on interest rates or borrowing. The complexity and degree and speed of change in the society, combined with the challenge of measuring some of these (e.g. in relation to longevity, migration or illness patterns or fine movements in inflation or other aspects of national accounts) give rise to periodic debates about some of its indicators and portrayals. Many of these rely on sources which are outside ONS, while some of its own sources need to be supplemented, for example between censuses, by updated but less rigorously obtained information from other sources. Consequently, unexpected or incomplete data or occasional errors or disputes about its analysis can also attract considerable attention. 

ONS data can also be used in epidemiologic studies such as survival analysis.

== Independence ==
Gordon Brown, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced on 28 November 2005, that the government intended to publish plans in early 2006 to legislate that the ONS and the statistics it generates are independent of government on a model based on the independence of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England. This was originally a 1997 Labour manifesto commitment and was also the policy of the Liberal Democrat and Conservative parties. Such independence was also sought by the Royal Statistical Society and the Statistics Commission. 
The National Statistician would be directly accountable to Parliament through a more widely constituted independent governing Statistics Board. The ONS would be a non-ministerial government department so that the staff, including the Director, would remain as civil servants but without being under direct ministerial control. 
The then National Statistician, Dame Karen Dunnell, stated that legislation would help improve public trust in official statistics (although the ONS already acted independently, as per its own published guidelines, the National Statistics Code of Practice, which set out the key principles and standards that official statisticians, including those in other parts of the government statistical service, were expected to follow and uphold).

The details of the plans for independence were considered in Parliament during the 2006/2007 session and resulted in the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007. In July 2007, Sir Michael Scholar was nominated by the government to be the three-day-a-week non-executive chairman of the Statistics Board which, with the intention of re-establishing faith in the integrity of government statistics, was to take on statutory responsibility for oversight of UK statistics in April 2008 and oversee the Office for National Statistics; also having a duty to assess all UK government statistics. Following Gordon Brown&#x27;s announcement of new constitutional arrangements for public appointments, Sir Michael also became, on 18 July, the first such nominee to appear before the House of Commons Treasury Committee and to have his nomination subject to confirmation by the House. On 7 February 2008, following the first meeting of the shadow board, it was announced that it would be known as the UK Statistics Authority (UKSA).

In 2012, Andrew Dilnot replaced Michael Scholar as chairman of the Authority.

== Heads of the Office and the National Statistician ==
Since its establishment, ONS has had five Directors: professor Tim Holt; Len Cook; Karen Dunnell; Jil Matheson; and, from October 2012, Glen Watson. Len Cook was the first Director to hold the newly created role of National Statistician. The roles of Director of ONS and National Statistician were combined until 2012 when Jil Matheson continued as National Statistician while Glen Watson became Director of the ONS. John Pullinger replaced Jil Matheson as National Statistician (and Chief Executive of the UK Statistics Authority) in July 2014. Pullinger retired in June 2019 and in October 2019 professor Sir Ian Diamond assumed the role of National Statistician.

== Work ==
The work of the ONS covers the collection of data and the analysis and publication of statistics covering the economy, population, and society of the UK. 

Where data is broken down by geographical area, this is usually done by the areas defined in the ONS geographical coding system.

=== Data collection ===
The principal areas of data collection include:
*Agriculture and Environment
*Business and Energy
*Children, Education and Skills
*Crime and Justice
*Economy (ESCoE)
*Government
*Health and Social Care
*Labour Market
*People and Places
*Population
*Travel and Transport

Statisticians are also employed by many other Government departments and agencies, and these statisticians often collect and publish data. They are members of the Government Statistical Service and are the professional responsibility of the head of the service, who is also the National Statistician. Each department has a statistical service &quot;Head of Profession&quot;. For example, data on Agriculture, Fishing and Forestry comes primarily from the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Along with economic data on which the Treasury and Bank of England rely for decision-making, many of the statistics that receive widespread media attention are issued by the Home Office, the Department of Health, and the Department for Education and Skills. ONS is also responsible for the maintenance of the &quot;Inter-Departmental Business Register&quot; and the &quot;Business Structure Database&quot;.

=== Former departments ===
Before the establishment of the UK Statistics Authority, the statistical work of ONS, since June 2000, was scrutinised by the Statistics Commission, an independent body with its own chairman and small staff. This ceased to operate from 1 April 2008. The General Register Office and the post of Registrar-General for England and Wales ceased to be part of ONS from that date but remains subject to ministerial accountability within the Home Office.

=== The Blue Book ===
The annual United Kingdom National Accounts are published in an online publication (The Blue Book) by the Office for National Statistics. It records and describes economic activity in the United Kingdom and as such is used by government, banks, academics and industries to formulate the economic and social policies and monitor the economic progress of the United Kingdom. It also allows international comparisons to be made. The Blue Book is published alongside the United Kingdom Balance of Payments – The Pink Book.

=== Education of statisticians ===
The Office for National Statistics collaborates with the University of Southampton in the teaching of an MSc in Official Statistics; the programme has been running since 2003.

=== Virtual Microdata Laboratory ===
The Virtual Microdata Laboratory (VML) was established in 2004 to allow researchers access to business data. It is a secure facility within the Office for National Statistics where both government officials and academic researchers can analyse sensitive, detailed data for statistical purposes. The researchers cannot download the data or take any copies out of the laboratory and the results of the analysis is checked for statistical disclosure.

== Office locations ==
The ONS has a head office in the city of Newport, Wales, and other offices in 2 Marsham Street in London and Titchfield in Hampshire. The Family Records Centre in Myddelton Street in Islington, London, moved to the National Archives in Kew in 2008. They also have an Archive Storage site located in Christchurch, Dorset.

=== Former headquarters ===
The London (Pimlico) office was the head office until April 2006 when the corporate headquarters was moved to Newport following the Lyons Review on public sector relocation. Between 2011 and 2022 the London office was located on the 2nd floor of the former Drummond Gate headquarters; since 2022 the London office has been located in 2 Marsham Street.

=== Gradual move of functions to South Wales ===
The ONS asserted that recruitment and training of quality staff in South Wales, where data collection and analysis already took place, would ensure that there was no risk to the quality of its services and that it managed the risks associated with the changes. However, the plan to discontinue statistical activity in London proved controversial amid claims that the shift of functions from London and the closure of the London office would have serious implications for the future of certain sets of statistics. These include health statistics, National Accounts, Retail and Consumer Prices and Labour Market Statistics. These risks were stated to derive from the fact that few of the experienced staff working in these highly technical areas were expected to relocate to Newport, resulting in a substantial loss of expertise and a consequent threat to the continued quality of the statistics. In a submission to the Parliamentary Treasury Sub Committee, the Bank of England expressed concern over the relocation of the ONS to Newport, saying, that &quot;the relocation programme poses serious risks to the maintenance of the quality of macroeconomic data. If substantial numbers of ONS staff are unwilling to relocate, the loss of skilled individuals could have a severe impact on a range of statistics.&quot; The director of ONS at the time vigorously defended the implementation of government policy on civil service relocation and the decision to concentrate staff in the three locations outside London.

== Criticism ==

The Office for National Statistics won the 2004 Big Brother Award for the &quot;Most Heinous Government Organisation&quot; from the campaigning organisation Privacy International for its Citizen Information Project. The project is one of several that led the Information Commissioner to warn that there is a danger of the country &quot;sleepwalking&quot; into a surveillance society.

In December 2012 the organisation&#x27;s new website to provide statistics to the public was described as &quot;a disaster&quot; by members of parliament on the Public Administration Committee. The chair of the UK Statistics Authority said that significant improvements to the website were being made, but admitted that its state at the time made it &quot;difficult to use, difficult to navigate and difficult to search&quot;.

In 2016, professor Sir Charles Bean conducted an independent review of UK Economic Statistics. He notes that although there is much criticism of the ONS&#x27;s performance, particularly of the size and frequency of revisions, that this criticism is &quot;not entirely justified&quot;. Following the review, the then-Chair of the Treasury Select Committee, Andrew Tyrie, criticised the ONS for being &quot;out of touch&quot;.

In 2019, the ONS admitted that EU migration to the UK may have been underestimated due to methodology of the International Passenger Survey. 

In 2025, the ONS suggested that unreliable employment data was a result of smart door bells.

<doc id="324031" wikidata="Q4819953" url="?curid=324031" title="Audit regime">
<text>An audit regime is usually a rigorous set of forensic accounting methods that is used to detect fraud. It refers more generally however to any similar regime of verification of conformity to some standard, e.g. Kyoto Protocol, Harkin–Engel Protocol, or some mandatory labeling scheme. Without such a regime, transparency is simply not attainable. 

Most accounting reform includes strict audit measures to verify that new standards are met.

Financial privacy is often in direct conflict with the desire for any stricter audit regimes.

Characteristics of an effective audit regime include:
* harsh penalties for any misleading or fraudulent disclosures to the auditor that are strictly enforced
* publicly visible reports and definitions, e.g. for capital categories
* an incorruptible profession of auditors that adheres to strict ethical codes, and whose careers are permanently and irrevocably destroyed by any serious impropriety
* strict standards to declare conflict of interest, and rules to prevent competitive arrangements that tend to create such conflicts, e.g. not permitting the auditor to also act as a consultant on meeting the regime&#x27;s requirements.

After major accounting scandals in the United States that became publicly visible in 2001 and 2002, and the controversies about various ways of claiming carbon credits under the Kyoto Protocol, there has been increasing attention paid to audit regimes in the English speaking world. This has often focused on bringing United States standards up to the level of much stricter United Kingdom or European Union standards, which are of more recent origins.

<doc id="324035" wikidata="Q1417038" url="?curid=324035" title="Kurtka">
<text>A kurtka () is the generic word for a jacket in a number of European languages, most notably in Polish and Russian.

==Etymology==
The word itself is a Slavic diminutive of the original Hungarian word &quot;kurta&quot;, which in turn was derived of the Latin word &quot;curtus&quot;, &quot;excurtus&quot;, meaning short (see Alejandro Cioranescu: Diccionario Etimologico Rumano).

==Military uniforms==
In terms of military uniforms, the kurtka was a type of close fitting double breasted jacket, cut to the waist and often worn with a plastron, a contrasting-coloured panel of cloth covering the chest. It was worn by lancers and uhlans, a type of light cavalry which had its origins in the Lipka Tatars who served the kings of Poland, but were widely copied by the armies of many western nations from the start of the 19th century along with their distinctive style of dress.

The lancer&#x27;s kurtka developed from a jacket called a &quot;kontusz&quot;, which during the late 18th century became shortened into the kurtka. 
==Martial arts==
In addition to the general meaning of &quot;jacket&quot;, the word &quot;kurtka&quot; refers to the garment normally worn by Sambo practitioners, similar to the keikogi in style and function, although it is tighter fitting and has epaulettes and belt loops. A kurtka should be made of canvas or other heavy material, should be tight-fitting, should not extend more than eight inches below the belt (roughly equal to the bottom of the sleeve) and the sleeves must be long enough to cover the arms to the wrists, and wide enough at the end to fit the wrist and four fingers.

<doc id="324038" wikidata="Q862627" url="?curid=324038" title="Revolutionary Communist League (France)">
<text>The Revolutionary Communist League (; LCR) was a Trotskyist political party in France. It was the French section of the Fourth International (Post-Reunification). It published the weekly newspaper &quot;Rouge&quot; and the journal &quot;Critique communiste&quot;. Established in 1974, it became the leading party of the French far-left in the 2000s. It officially abolished itself on 5 February 2009 to merge with smaller factions of the far-left and form a New Anticapitalist Party.

==History==

It was founded in 1974, after its forerunner the Communist League (Ligue Communiste) was banned in 1973. The Communist League was itself founded in 1969 after the Revolutionary Communist Youth (Jeunesses Communistes Révolutionnaires), which was banned in 1968, had merged with Pierre Frank&#x27;s Internationalist Communist Party. The group included members of other Trotskyist tendencies who were able to organise openly within its ranks to gain support for their views.

Its official spokespersons were Alain Krivine, Roseline Vachetta, who are former members of the European Parliament, and Olivier Besancenot who was the party&#x27;s candidate for the presidential elections in 2002 and 2007.

A major issue in the party&#x27;s latter years was the possibility and conditions of electoral alliances with other left wing forces, such as the fellow Trotskyist party Lutte Ouvrière. In the past the two had at times run joint candidates (for example in the last regional and European elections), and at times ran separately (for example in the 2002 and 2007 presidential elections).

In a situation where massive campaigns against government policy have brought millions into the streets, but established political parties have lost a lot of credibility, the idea of unifying the radical Left in an electoral alliance was much discussed. There were for example talks for an alliance with the French Communist Party, after both parties worked together on the victorious campaign of the &#x27;No&#x27; in the 2005 French referendum on the Constitution of the European Union. Relations between the two parties had been improving since Marie-George Buffet took over the leadership of the PCF.

LCR militants openly worked within left-wing groups such as ATTAC and the Solidaires Unitaires Démocratiques trade unions, although both are independent from political parties (and have members from other political backgrounds).

===Dissolution===

The Revolutionary Communist League was the leading force in the creation of the New Anticapitalist Party, launched in June 2008, which was intended to unify the parties and movements of the far left.

On 5 February 2009, 87,1% of party members voted to dissolve the Revolutionary Communist League, with 11.5% voting against. The dissolution was intended solely to enable the LCR to become the New Anticapitalist Party. Alain Krivine, who had been one of the party&#x27;s founders, said: &quot;We&#x27;re not dissolving, as such. We&#x27;ll continue the revolutionary struggle, with a tool that&#x27;s much better suited for it than the LCR.&quot;

==Presidential elections (2002 and 2007)==

In France&#x27;s 2002 presidential election, the LCR&#x27;s candidate Olivier Besancenot won 4.25% of the vote. Thus the far left (LCR, Lutte Ouvrière and Parti des travailleurs) gained a total of more than 10%. The run-off election provided voters with only a choice between the right-wing Chirac and the far-right Le Pen. The left in its vast majority voted for Chirac. The LCR did not call for abstention: the LCR campaigned to &quot;minimize the vote to Le Pen&quot;. The LCR campaign was run under the slogan &quot;Beat Le Pen on the streets and in the ballot box&quot;. A minority within the LCR were opposed to this slogan, believing that it amounted to a call to vote for Chirac.

For the 2007 French presidential election, the LCR&#x27;s candidate was again Olivier Besancenot, gaining around 4.1% at the first round. As he fell under the 5% barrier, the state did not cover the campaign&#x27;s expenses above 800,000 euros. However, as the party spent approximatively this sum, according to Pierre-François Grond, a member of the direction, it will not be financially affected by Besancenot&#x27;s lower score.

<text>Elliot Lee Richardson (July 20, 1920December 31, 1999) was an American lawyer and Republican politician. As a member of the cabinets of Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford between 1970 and 1977, Richardson is one of two men in United States history to hold four cabinet positions. As United States Attorney General, Richardson played a prominent role in the Watergate scandal when he resigned in protest against President Nixon&#x27;s order to fire special prosecutor Archibald Cox. His resignation precipitated a crisis of confidence in Nixon which ultimately led to the president&#x27;s resignation.

Born in Boston, Richardson attended Harvard University. After graduating, he served in World War II as a combat medic and participated in the invasion of Normandy. He returned home, attended Harvard Law School, and clerked for Learned Hand and Felix Frankfurter before beginning his legal career at Ropes &amp; Gray. Richardson began a long career in public office in 1959 when he was appointed by President Dwight Eisenhower to the position of United States Attorney in the District of Massachusetts, the lead federal prosecutor in the state. Through the 1960s, he was a leading figure in the Massachusetts Republican Party and won election as the 62nd lieutenant governor in 1964 and the attorney general in 1966. As of 2025, he is the last Republican to serve as Massachusetts Attorney General.

In 1969, he joined the Richard Nixon administration as United States Under Secretary of State. He was promoted to a cabinet role in 1970 as Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, serving until January 1973, when he became Secretary of Defense, serving briefly before he became Attorney General in May. After his high-profile resignation from the Nixon cabinet, he returned to government in the Gerald Ford administration in March 1975 as United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom and Secretary of Commerce from 1976 to 1977. 

After the Ford administration, Richardson returned to private practice as an attorney in Washington. He advised Democratic president Jimmy Carter on maritime law and briefly returned to politics with an unsuccessful run for United States Senate in 1984, when he lost the Republican primary to Ray Shamie.

==Early life and career==
Elliot Lee Richardson was born in Boston, Massachusetts on July 20, 1920. His mother was Clara Lee Richardson (née Shattuck). His father, Edward Peirson Richardson, was a physician and professor at Harvard Medical School and member of a leading Boston Brahmin family in the city&#x27;s medical community, including his father, surgeon Maurice Howe Richardson, and brother, naturalist and author Wyman Richardson. In addition to his father, both of Richardson&#x27;s grandfathers, three uncles, and two of his brothers were physicians at Harvard Medical and Massachusetts General Hospital.

Richardson attended the Park School in Brookline and Milton Academy in Milton, both in Massachusetts. He then obtained his A.B. degree in philosophy from Harvard College, where he resided in Winthrop House, graduated cum laude in 1941, and was an editor of the &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot;.

===World War II service===
In 1942, following the U.S. entry into World War II, Richardson enlisted as a combat medic in the U.S. 4th Infantry Division. He participated in the June 6, 1944, Normandy Invasion as a platoon leader, where he crossed a minefield to rescue a fellow officer whose foot was blown off. He was among the first troops to come up &quot;Causeway No. 2&quot; from Utah Beach, which had been under fire from German artillery at Brécourt Manor. He was among the many who noticed the guns ceasing their firing after (unbeknownst to him) paratroopers of the 101st under Lieutenant Richard Winters had knocked them out. After Stephen Ambrose&#x27;s book &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; was published, Richardson wrote to Winters and thanked him.

He continued to serve in the 4th Infantry Division throughout the European campaign and received the Bronze Star Medal and Purple Heart with oak leaf cluster. He was discharged in 1945 with the rank of first lieutenant.

===Legal career===
Following his discharge, Richardson enrolled at Harvard Law School. In choosing law over medicine, Richardson would later reflect, &quot;I was not sorry to pass up medicine as a career. It seemed too much like a book I had read before.&quot; While at Harvard, he served as president of the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot;.

After his graduation in 1947, Richardson was a law clerk for Judge Learned Hand on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter on the Supreme Court of the United States. Following his clerkships, Richardson joined the law firm Ropes, Gray, Best, Coolidge &amp; Rugg (now Ropes &amp; Gray) in Boston but soon became convinced that private practice &quot;did not match the satisfaction of doing a good job for the public.&quot; In 1953, Frankfurter proposed Richardson for the presidency of Harvard when the office became open, even though Richardson was only 33 years old.

===Early political career===
While at Ropes &amp; Gray, Richardson became active in Massachusetts Republican politics and supported the presidential campaign of Dwight D. Eisenhower. In 1953, he briefly joined the staff of United States Senator Leverett Saltonstall before returning to private practice. In 1957, Eisenhower appointed Richardson assistant secretary for legislation in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, where he worked to develop the National Defense Education Act and Social Security legislation. 

In 1959, Eisenhower appointed Richardson to serve as United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts. He gained a reputation as a tough prosecutor with a special reputation for tax fraud cases. He later wrote, &quot;in my Inferno, tax evaders occupy a circle of their own. ... I take great satisfaction, therefore, in the fact that during my tenure as U.S. Attorney for the district of Massachusetts, every tax evader we prosecuted was convicted, and all of them went to jail.&quot; Among his highest profile convictions was that of Bernard Goldfine, a Boston textile manufacturer, for gifts to White House aide Sherman Adams. He remained in the role through the end of the Eisenhower administration in 1961, when he returned to Ropes &amp; Gray as a partner.

In 1962, Richardson ran for Attorney General of Massachusetts but lost the Republican primary to Edward Brooke. 

After returning to the firm, Richardson left permanently in 1964 after he was elected the Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts. In 1966, he was elected Attorney General of Massachusetts to succeed Brooke. As of 2023, he is the last Republican to have served as Attorney General of Massachusetts.

==Nixon administration==

Richardson joined the Nixon administration in 1969 as undersecretary of state.

Richardson had the distinction of serving in three high-level Executive Branch posts in a single year—the tumultuous year of 1973—as the Watergate Scandal came to dominate the attention of official Washington, and the American public at large. He is one of two persons to hold four separate cabinet positions. 

===1970–73: Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare===
In June 1970, Nixon asked Richardson to serve as secretary of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, with the intent of reducing inefficiency and bureaucracy. At HEW, Richardson sought to simplify grant processing and consolidate duplicate programs. He faced criticism from liberals for undercutting desegregation busing programs in public schools. He also developed a national health care plan during his time at HEW.

In September 1970, Richardson was present at the funeral of President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, where he secretly met with Nasser&#x27;s successor, Anwar Sadat, to discuss U.S. involvement in peace negotiations with Israel.

In 1972, Richardson established the National High Blood Pressure Education Program at the urging of Mary Lasker who came armed with copies of the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study Group on Antihypertensive Agents, directed by Edward Freis.

===January–May 1973: Secretary of Defense===
Richardson was appointed United States Secretary of Defense on January 30, 1973. When President Nixon selected Richardson as secretary, the press described him as an excellent manager and administrator. In his confirmation hearing, Richardson expressed agreement with Nixon&#x27;s policies on such issues as the adequacy of U.S. strategic forces, NATO and relationships with other allies, and Vietnam. His primary role as Secretary was as the administration&#x27;s spokesman for the legality of the covert bombing of Cambodia.

Although he promised to examine the budget carefully to identify areas for savings, and in fact later ordered the closure of some military installations, Richardson cautioned against precipitate reductions. As he told a Senate committee, &quot;Significant cuts in the Defense Budget now would seriously weaken the U.S. position on international negotiations—in which U.S. military capabilities, in both real and symbolic terms, are an important factor.&quot; Similarly, he strongly supported continued military assistance at current levels. During his short tenure, Richardson spent much time testifying before congressional committees on the proposed FY 1974 budget and other Defense matters.

===May–Oct 1973: U.S. Attorney General===
After only three months as Secretary of Defense, Richardson became Nixon&#x27;s Attorney General, a move that would put him in the Watergate spotlight.

====Investigation of Spiro Agnew====
As Attorney General, Richardson supervised the investigation by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland, George Beall, into claims that Vice President Spiro Agnew accepted bribes and kickbacks as Baltimore County Executive and Governor of Maryland. By the time Richardson was sworn in as Attorney General, Beall&#x27;s investigation had revealed that Agnew received five percent of county and state contracts from engineer Lester Matz during his time in office. Agnew had been aware of the investigation since February and had met with Richardson&#x27;s predecessor, Richard Kleindienst, to reach Beall.

On July 3, Beall informed Richardson that Agnew had continued receiving kickbacks as vice president, meaning he was no longer shielded from prosecution by the statute of limitations. At the end of the month, White House chief of staff Alexander Haig and the President were informed, and on August 1, Beall informed Agnew&#x27;s attorney that the vice president was under investigation for tax fraud and corruption.

Nixon ordered Richardson to personally take responsibility for the investigation, and he met with Agnew and his attorneys on August 6 to discuss the case. The same day, the story became public in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;. Just before Agnew resigned, Richardson was portrayed as a cartoon figure with Agnew and Nixon on the October 8, 1973 cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. Agnew was quoted, &quot;I am innocent of the charges against me. I will not resign if indicted!&quot; He resigned as vice president on October 10.

Agnew later claimed Richardson had pressed for his prosecution for the specific reason that Richardson wished to be appointed as vice president, which would either give him the inside track for the Republican presidential nomination in 1976, or, should Nixon resign over Watergate, elevate Richardson to the presidency. Richardson denied taking any extraordinary steps to advance the investigation.

====Watergate investigation and resignation====

Richardon&#x27;s primary legacy as Attorney General comes from his involvement, and eventual resignation over, the investigations into the Watergate scandal, in which White House staffers and members of the 1972 presidential campaign coordinated to break into the Democratic National Committee headquarters on June 17, 1972. By the time Richardson took office as Attorney General on May 25, 1973, the burglars had pleaded or been found guilty and the week prior, the United States Senate had begun a series of hearings into the matter.

On his first day in office, Richardson appointed Archibald Cox to serve as a special prosecutor for the federal investigation into possible ties between the Nixon administration and the break-in. Following the revelation of the existence of recordings of conversations within the White House, Nixon refused to comply with subpoenas by both Cox and the Senate committee. On October 20, President Nixon ordered Richardson to fire Cox as special prosecutor. Richardson had promised Congress he would not interfere with the special prosecutor, and, rather than breaking his promise, he resigned. Addressing the Justice Department attorneys, he said, &quot;I can only say that you have here a situation in which the president, and I know nothing to call this into question, believed that the confidentiality of communications to the president was fundamentally important.&quot;

President Nixon subsequently ordered Richardson&#x27;s second-in-command, Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus, to carry out the order. He too had promised not to interfere and also tendered his resignation. The third-ranking Department of Justice official, United States Solicitor General Robert Bork, planned to resign after firing Cox, but Richardson persuaded him not to in order to ensure proper leadership at the Department of Justice during the crisis. Bork carried out the President&#x27;s order, thus completing the events generally referred to as the Saturday Night Massacre. When Bork was unsuccessfully nominated to the Supreme Court of the United States by President Ronald Reagan in 1987, Richardson testified on his behalf.

In 1974, Richardson received the John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards. Despite the popular acclaim Richardson received for his refusal to fire Cox, he privately told friends he was deeply troubled by his decision, which conflicted with his sense of loyalty and allegiance to President Nixon. He later characterized the episode as his &quot;brief period of notoriety.&quot; Reflecting on Watergate in his memoirs, Richardson wrote that he had attempted to persuade Nixon to take a different course before eventually refusing him. &quot;The height of irony,&quot; Richardson wrote, &quot;was that even a belated display of openness could have saved Nixon from the consequences of his own evasion of it. ... I said to Fred Buzhardt, counsel to the president, &#x27;You ought, instead, tell Archie Cox to send over a truck and load it up with all the material he and his staff could possibly want.&#x27; In the event, if anything damaging was found, Nixon could issue a public apology and couple it with a convincing expression of penitence. The American people, I thought, would be more than likely to forgive and forget.&quot; Pat Buchanan recounted that on the day Richardson was dismissed, Nixon said, &quot;I don&#x27;t have any choice, I can&#x27;t have President [Leonid] Brezhnev watch me be bullied by a member of my cabinet, I&#x27;ve got to fire him.&quot;

== Ford administration ==
During the Gerald Ford administration, Richardson served as Ambassador to the United Kingdom from 1975 to 1976 and as United States Secretary of Commerce from 1976 to 1977.

Richardson&#x27;s acceptance in 1975 of the appointment as Ambassador to the Court of St. James&#x27;s, as it is formally titled, effectively eliminated him from the domestic scene during the pre-election-year period. In departing for that position, he indicated to reporters that he would not run for the presidency unless Ford decided against running for a term in his own right. 

==Later life==
From 1977 to 1980, he served as an Ambassador-at-Large and Special Representative of President Jimmy Carter for the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and head of the U.S. delegation to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea.

From 1980 to 1992, Richardson was partner in the Washington office of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy. In the 1980s and early 1990s, Richardson was the attorney for Inslaw, Inc., an American software company which alleged that its software had been pirated by the U.S. Justice Department. In 1994, Richardson backed President Bill Clinton during his struggle against Paula Jones&#x27;s charge of sexual harassment. In 1998, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation&#x27;s highest civilian honor.

In 1984, he ran for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Paul Tsongas. Although Richardson was favored to win the seat, he was defeated in the GOP primary by more conservative candidate Ray Shamie, who lost the general election to John Forbes Kerry.

In a 1997 interview with Geoffrey Kabaservice, Richardson argued that the Clinton administration was to the right of the Republican administrations of Richard Nixon and Dwight D. Eisenhower.

==Personal life==
Richardson&#x27;s older son, Henry S. Richardson, is a professor of philosophy at Georgetown University, where he focuses on moral and political philosophy.

Richardson was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1958. Richardson was also an active Freemason as a member of the Grand Lodge of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and a 33rd Degree Freemason in the Scottish Rite Northern Masonic Jurisdiction. In 1980, Richardson received an honorary degree from Bates College. In 1983, Richardson was admitted as an honorary member of the Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati.

===Author===
Richardson was the author of two books. &quot;The Creative Balance: Government, Politics, and the Individual in America&#x27;s Third Century&quot; was published by Holt, Rinehart and Winston in 1976. &quot;Reflections of a Radical Moderate&quot; was published by Westview Press in 1996. &quot;Reflections&quot; expresses his outlook:

I am a moderate – a radical moderate. I believe profoundly in the ultimate value of human dignity and equality. I therefore believe as well in such essential contributions to these ends as fairness, tolerance, and mutual respect. In seeking to be fair, tolerant, and respectful I need to call upon all the empathy, understanding, rationality, skepticism, balance, and objectivity I can muster.

In the same book, Richardson decries &quot;excessive government legislation&quot;, but also notes that the government is necessary to tackle serious issues.

In 1972, Richardson was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters (L.H.D.) degree from Whittier College. In 1974 Richardson gave the commencement address at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology and received an honorary Doctors of Law.

==Death and legacy==
Richardson&#x27;s wife, Anne, died on July 26, 1999. On December 29, 1999, Richardson was admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital while visiting family in Boston, and died two days later of a cerebral hemorrhage at the age of 79.

President Bill Clinton issued a public statement hailing Richardson as &quot;an unparalleled public servant&quot; and &quot;a man of uncommon integrity, who put the nation&#x27;s interests first even when the personal cost was very high.&quot; The Associated Press wrote that Mr. Richardson was &quot;a man of immaculate attire and rare distinction, a flexible George Apley with wit ... a relentless achiever with a dazzling variety of government experience, a man of elegance and charm with spectacular mental powers, a prince of the Eastern Establishment.&quot;

===In popular culture===
An image of Richardson taken by photographer Garry Winogrand is featured on the cover art of rock band Interpol&#x27;s 2018 album &quot;Marauder&quot;. Singer and guitarist Paul Banks referred to him as a hero, who &quot;refused to be bullied into going against his personal principles&quot;.

Online menswear commentator Derek Guy uses an illustration of Richardson as his avatar, and has said that &quot;he was one of the best-dressed men in American politics, ever.&quot;

<text>Stroud is a market town and civil parish in Gloucestershire, England. It is the main town in Stroud District. The town&#x27;s population was 13,500 in 2021.

Sited below the western escarpment of the Cotswold Hills, at the meeting point of the Five Valleys, the town is noted for its steep streets. The Cotswold Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty surrounds the town, and the Cotswold Way path passes by it to the west. It lies south of the city of Gloucester, south-southwest of Cheltenham, west-northwest of Cirencester and north-east of the city of Bristol. London is east-southeast of Stroud and the Welsh border at Whitebrook, Monmouthshire, is to the west. Not part of the town itself, the civil parishes of Rodborough and Cainscross form part of Stroud&#x27;s urban area.

Stroud acts as a commercial centre for surrounding villages and market towns including Amberley, Bisley, Bussage, Chalford, Dursley, Eastcombe, Eastington, King&#x27;s Stanley, Leonard Stanley, Minchinhampton, Nailsworth, Oakridge, Painswick, Randwick, Selsley, Sheepscombe, Slad, Stonehouse, Brimscombe &amp; Thrupp, Whiteshill and Woodchester.

In March 2021 &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; named Stroud the best place to live in the UK, citing the town&#x27;s abundance of green spaces, independent spirit, and high quality of schools.

==Etymology==
Stroud was named &quot;La Strode&quot; in a document of 1221, though most early records use the spelling &quot;Stroud&quot;. The Old English name &quot;Strōd&quot; refers to a &quot;marshy land overgrown with brushwood&quot;. Although the name is now pronounced to rhyme with &quot;proud&quot;, its original pronunciation survives in the Kent town of Strood, which has the same etymology.

==History==
Stroud is known for its involvement in the Industrial Revolution. It was a cloth town: woollen mills were powered by the small rivers which flow through the five valleys, and supplied from Cotswold sheep which grazed on the hills above. Particularly noteworthy was the production of military uniforms in the colour Stroudwater Scarlet. Stroud became known for its production of broadcloth, which was widely known as &quot;Stroud cloth&quot; and traded around the world. The area became home to a sizable Huguenot community in the 17th century, fleeing from persecution in Catholic France, followed by a significant Jewish presence in the 19th century, linked to the tailoring and cloth industries. There were two synagogues by 1889, but these became disused by around 1908.

Stroud was an industrial and trading location in the 19th century, and so needed transport links. It first had a canal network in the form of the Stroudwater Navigation and the Thames &amp; Severn Canal, both of which survived until the early 20th century. Restoration of these canals as a leisure facility by a partnership of Stroud District Council and the Cotswold Canals Trust is well under way with a multimillion-pound Lottery grant. Stroud railway station (on the Gloucester–Swindon Golden Valley Line) was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel.

Though there is much evidence of early historic settlement and transport, Stroud parish was originally part of Bisley, and only began to emerge as a distinct unit in the 13th century, taking its name from the marshy ground at the confluence of the Slad Brook and the River Frome called &quot;La Strode&quot;, and was first recorded in 1221. The church was built by 1279, and it was assigned parochial rights by the rectors of Bisley in 1304, often cited as the date of Stroud&#x27;s foundation.

Historic buildings and places of interest in the area include the neolithic long barrows at Uley, Selsley Common and Nympsfield to the west; Roman era remains at Frocester, West Hill near Uley, and Woodchester; the medieval buildings at Beverston Castle; and the outstanding Tudor houses at Newark Park and Owlpen Manor. Woodchester Mansion is a masterpiece of the Gothic Revival by local architect Benjamin Bucknall.

From 1837 to 1841, Stroud&#x27;s MP was Lord John Russell of the Whig party, who later became prime minister. Russell was an important politician: he was responsible for passing Acts of Parliament such as the Public Health Act 1848, but he is mainly remembered as one of the chief architects of the Reform Act 1867. This Act, also known as the Second Reform Act, gave the vote to every urban male householder, not just those of considerable means. This increased the electorate by 1.5 million voters. Lord John Russell is remembered in the town in the names of two streets, John Street and Russell Street, as well as the Lord John public house. In 1835 the local press referred to Lord John Russell&#x27;s opportunism in choosing Stroud as his new constituency as &#x27;trying his hand in the vales of Gotham&#x27;, a reference to a 1798 poem mocking Stroud residents for opening a church organ &quot;before it could speak&quot;. &quot;Gotham&quot; was a popular local town nickname and &quot;house&quot; name at Eastcombe Manor school in the 1940s and 1950s.

===Neolithic remains===

The long barrow at Randwick measures about , and stands high at the north-east end. Excavations in 1883 found an opening to the north-east, from which there was access to a simple square chamber of one cell containing disarticulated human remains. Traces of the chamber can still be seen, although it is not accessible. Additional burials were found adjacent to the barrow on the south-west side.

The Iron Age tribesmen of Gloucestershire made their final stand against the massive Roman invasion on Minchinhampton Common. Survivors eventually fled to the north. Some earthworks, known as &#x27;the Bulwarks&#x27;, and the Longstone of Minchinhampton are evidence of these ancient fortifications.

=== Roman remains ===
Woodchester Roman Villa is one of many Roman villas discovered in Gloucestershire. It was occupied between the early 2nd and late 4th centuries AD. There is now nothing visible of the villa above ground and the site is occupied by a churchyard. The villa&#x27;s most famous feature is the Orpheus mosaic, the second largest of its kind in Europe and one of the most intricate. It dates to and was re-discovered by Gloucestershire-born antiquarian Samuel Lysons in 1793. It has been uncovered seven times since 1880, the last time in 1973, but there are no plans to reveal it again. It depicts Orpheus charming all forms of life with his lyre and has been praised for its accuracy and beauty.

In 1979, several portions of Roman tessellated pavement, Roman tiles, coins, pottery, etc. were discovered in the grounds of the house at Brown&#x27;s Hill, one mile north of Stroud, suggesting the existence of a Roman villa.

Remains of another Roman villa have been found in the parish of Painswick, on a farm called Highfield, about northwest of the town. Walls were found, crossing one another at right angles; also many flue tiles, and some Roman coins. It was opened some years ago in a rough and hurried way, and covered up again. A short account of it appeared in the public press at the time.

The excavation at a site at Ebley Road in Stonehouse has revealed evidence of some of the earliest Roman activity known in the Stroud Valleys. A large rectangular enclosure dating back to the 1st century AD was found and more than a dozen human skeletons were unearthed at the end of 2010.

==Demography==
At the 2001 UK census, Stroud civil parish had a total population of 12,690.
For every 100 females, there were 96.4 males. Ethnically, the population is predominantly white (98.2%). 20.6% of the population were under the age of 16 and 8.3% were aged 75 and over; the mean age of the people of the urban area was 39.5. 92.6% of residents described their health as &quot;fair&quot; or better, similar to the average of 92.8% for the wider district.
The average household size was 2.4.
Of those aged 16–74, 24.5% had no academic qualifications,
lower than the national average of 28.9%. Of those aged 16–74, 2.6% were unemployed and 28.4% were economically inactive. At the 2011 census, 107,026 people were described as white British, plus 591 being from the Irish Republic. 2,752 were white other, 364 Caribbean, 129 African, 429 Asian and 300 other Asian, all from mixed multiple ethnic groups. Of these, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh accounted for 258 people. Chinese and Arab people accounted for 226 people.
There are two definitions for the town of Stroud. The narrowest definition is the parish, which had a population of 13,259 in 2011 and only includes the town centre and inner suburban areas. The urban subdivision had a population of 32,670 and includes many suburbs often considered part of the town. The urban area, which includes Stonehouse that has a largely separate identity, and other surrounding villages had a population of 60,155. Despite its extensive urban area, Stroud is surrounded by the greenbelt of the Cotswolds to the north, south and east.

==Character and amenities==
Stroud has a significant artistic community that dates back to the early 20th century. Jasper Conran called Stroud &quot;the Covent Garden of the Cotswolds&quot;; the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; has referred to it as &quot;the artistic equivalent of bookish Hay-on-Wye&quot;; while the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot; likened the town to &quot;Notting Hill with wellies&quot;. The town has a large and diverse number of creative artists and musicians.


The town was one of the birthplaces of the organic food movement and was home to Britain&#x27;s first fully organic café. The Biodynamic Agricultural Association is based in the town.

For many years Stroud has hosted a fringe festival on the second weekend in September. A new committee took over in early 2015 and now holds the festival on August Bank Holiday each year. The festival has been expanded to cover art and literature, as well as a diverse range of unsigned bands who lack a contract with a record label. With a number of outdoor stages, and the majority of the venues in town taking part, over 400 performers can be seen free of charge over the course of the weekend. The town also hosts an annual series of lectures and exhibitions on contemporary textiles and textile culture called SELECT, run by Stroud International Textiles, an event that exhibits international textiles.

The Stroudwater Textile Trust was founded in 1999 to link the past and present of textiles in the Five Valleys and to manage the opening of several mills in which historic textile machinery, including a working waterwheel, has been restored and is demonstrated. The Trust has produced a DVD, &quot;Rivers of Cloth&quot;, using archive film and interviews which was due to be released in early 2011 and a photographic survey of surviving woollen mills was undertaken for a book, &quot;Wool and Water&quot;, published in 2012.
The Subscription Rooms at the centre of the town centre provide a venue for a variety of entertainment. There is also a small theatre, the Cotswold Playhouse, which is home to the amateur Cotswold Players; it occasionally hosts visiting professional companies.

On the fringes of the town are Stratford Park, originally the park of a small local weaver, now home to a leisure centre with an indoor and an outdoor swimming pool, and the Museum in the Park. Housed in a Grade II listed 17th-century wool merchant&#x27;s house, the museum collection tells the story of the Stroud District&#x27;s history. It has over 4,000 objects on display, including dinosaur bones, historical paintings and one of the world’s first lawnmowers. In addition to the main displays there is a modern extension which includes a purpose-built art gallery showing a varied programme of exhibitions. Behind this is a contemporary walled garden.

The Redlers industrial estate is the site of the original Dudbridge Mills, beside the River Frome. From the mid-18th century onwards it housed the three mills of Daniel Chance: one corn, one gig and a dyehouse with eight drying racks. It was acquired in 1794 by John Apperley, whose family used the site for wool- and cloth-making for the next 140 years. In 1801 an industrial accident killed a young worker.

===Campaigns===
Stroud citizens have a history of protest going back to the Stroudwater Riots of 1825. In the late 1970s Stroud Campaign Against The Ringroad prevented Gloucestershire County Council&#x27;s attempt to introduce new traffic plans. A few years later Stroud District Council tried to demolish 18th-century buildings in the town centre. Stroud High Street Action Group, with some rooftop protests and a high court judgement, demonstrated against this. The restored buildings are now a feature of the High Street. After a short occupation a compromise was reached in the demolition of buildings in Cornhill with many being saved, including one identified as a medieval house. This campaign led to the formation of the Stroud Preservation Trust which has been instrumental in saving many of the town&#x27;s oldest buildings such as Withey&#x27;s house, the Brunel Goods Shed and the Hill Paul building.

In 1989 Stroud District Council tried to fell at midnight thirteen trees in Stratford Park near the road, which attracted national and international attention. Local Save The Trees campaigners had got in position first and prevented the felling, which was intended to allow road-widening. Campaigners occupied the trees for the next six weeks while, with the help of Friends of the Earth, introducing the County Surveyor to &#x27;traffic calming&#x27; which he agreed to adopt instead of changing the road alignment. During the next five years County Surveyors&#x27; figures showed a fifty per cent decrease in accidents along this part of Stratford Road. The trees still survive.

In 2000 Stroud District Council gave permission for the Victorian landmark Hill Paul building to be demolished. After thwarting demolition, local activists formed a company and sold enough shares at £500 each to take an option on the building, which they passed on to a local developer. The building has now been restored and converted into apartments (see photo on the right). The full records of the Hill Paul building campaign are with the Gloucestershire Archivist at D9242/Accession 11679/3.

The Save Stroud Hospitals Taskforce has been campaigning since spring 2006 against a range of cuts to health services in and around Stroud, with thousands of people taking part in street demonstrations. Stroud Maternity Hospital was saved in September 2006.

The Uplands Post Office branch in Stroud was one of 26 in the county to shut as part of a nationwide programme to cut losses.
Following local opposition, the Post Office agreed to talks with civic chiefs to look at how it could reopen. The town council agreed to provide £10,000 of funding for the service in 2008 and up to £25,000 for 2009. In November 2008 it was confirmed that Stroud has become only the second place in Britain to save one of its Post Offices.

In September 2010 the BNP scrapped plans to move their national media centre to Stroud after protests by local residents.

In February 2012 NHS managers agreed to halt plans for Stroud General Hospital to be run by a social enterprise after local residents mounted a legal challenge in the High Court.

==Business==
There is still a small textile industry (the green baize cloth used to cover snooker tables and the cloth covering championship tennis balls is made here), but today the town functions primarily as a centre for light engineering and small-scale manufacturing, and a provider of services for the surrounding villages. Stroud is a Fairtrade Town.

The Stroud and Swindon Building Society had its headquarters here until it merged with the Coventry Building Society in September 2010. The building is now the headquarters of the renewable energy provider Ecotricity.

Damien Hirst owns the &#x27;Science&#x27; facility in Stroud which produces his art.

In September 2009, the Stroud Pound Co-operative launched the Stroud Pound as an attempt to reinforce the local economy and encourage more local production. The currency&#x27;s design follows that of the Chiemgauer, in being backed on a one-for-one basis by the national currency, having a charge for redemption which is donated to local charities, and including a system of demurrage to encourage rapid circulation.

==Farmers&#x27; market==
A farmers&#x27; market, launched by Jasper Conran and Isabella Blow on 3 July 1999, takes place every Saturday at the Cornhill market. It was nominated for the national Farmers&#x27; Market of the Year in 2001 and won it in 2007 and 2013. It also won the &quot;Cotswold Life&quot; magazine award for the best farmers&#x27; market in Gloucestershire in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2010. The market featured in an episode of BBC TV&#x27;s &quot;The Hairy Bikers&#x27; Food Tour of Britain&quot; in September 2009, and won the Best Food Market award at the BBC Food &amp; Farming Awards 2010. It is certified by FARMA.

In addition to the farmers&#x27; market there is a smaller market held (Fri &amp; Sat) in The Shambles, an area adjacent to the steep High Street. John Wesley preached from a butcher&#x27;s block in The Shambles on 26 June 1742. The Old Town Hall is one of the oldest existing buildings in Stroud: originally referred to as the market house, it was built in 1596 and is still in occasional use today.
==Education==
===History===
&quot;There was a school at Stroud in 1576 but the schoolmaster, who did not have a licence and failed to teach the catechism, was then dismissed...&quot;

===Primary schools===
There are six primary schools in the town:
*Uplands Community Primary School
*Callowell Primary School
*Gastrells Community Primary School
*Rosary Catholic Primary School
*Severn View Academy
*Stroud Valley Community School

===Secondary schools===
There are three secondary schools in Stroud.

Archway School is a County Council maintained comprehensive school offering an 11-to-18 education for children in Stroud, Rodborough and Cainscross.

There are also two state-funded selective schools, Marling School and Stroud High School. These former grant-maintained and foundation schools became academies in 2011. Both schools can trace their history back to the founding of Marling School in 1889 and Stroud High School which was founded in 1904 as the Girls&#x27; Endowed School. They continued to be grammar schools long after the comprehensive school became the norm in secondary education, and their future was the subject of long-running controversy. The two schools previously shared a mixed sixth form, called the Downfield Sixth Form, which worked in a three-way consortium with Archway Sixth Form and South Gloucestershire and Stroud College.

Other secondary schools include Maidenhill School in Stonehouse, Thomas Keble School in Eastcombe, and the private Wycliffe College in Stonehouse.

===Tertiary education===
Tertiary education in the town is provided by South Gloucestershire and Stroud College.

The University of Gloucestershire has campuses a few miles to the north (in Cheltenham and Gloucester) and the Royal Agricultural University west of Cirencester is to the east.

==Transport==
There are multiple bus routes around Stroud, and to nearby towns as well as Gloucester, many of which are operated by Stagecoach West.

The town is also served by Great Western Railway trains from Stroud railway station, with frequent services to
Gloucester, Cheltenham, Swindon, Reading and London Paddington. The railway link was established in 1845. Up to then, Stroud had its own time which was set by a sundial at the top of Gloucester Street. There was also an observatory across the road from the hospital where now is a car park. As Stroud time was roughly 9 minutes behind GMT and people kept missing the train, a railway clock was put up in 1858 at the bottom of High Street. It was later moved across King Street to the top of Gloucester Street. The clock fell into disrepair over the years. It was finally saved by Captain Michael Maltin, who restored the clock in 1984 and found a new home for it in the Stroud library. Stonehouse railway station is on the western edge of the town and in the wider urban area.

The A46 road links Stroud to Cheltenham in the north and Bath to the south, with the A419
connecting Stroud to Cirencester in one direction and the M5 motorway at Junction 13 in the other.

National Express coaches serve the town on routes 401 (Bristol – London Victoria) and 445 (Hereford – London Victoria). Stroud also lies on the traffic-free section of Sustrans National Cycle Network Route 45.

Stroud was connected to the canal system when the Stroudwater Navigation opened in 1779. It then became part of a through canal route from Bristol to London when the Thames and Severn Canal added a route over the Cotswolds in 1789. The canal closed in 1954 but the Cotswold Canals Trust is leading a project to reopen the entire length of the trans-Cotswold route. A visitor centre and restored lock are located in the town.

==Literature==
Novelists Sue Limb, Jilly Cooper and Katie Fforde, children&#x27;s authors Jamila Gavin, John Dougherty Cindy Jefferies and Clive Dale, poet Jenny Joseph, and &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s food critic Matthew Fort have followed in the footsteps of the Rev. W. Awdry, and W. H. Davies and made the Stroud area their home.

Author Laurie Lee&#x27;s novel &quot;Cider with Rosie&quot; is set in the nearby Slad valley, and Booker Prize-winning author Alan Hollinghurst is from the town. Poets Dennis Gould, Ted Milton, Michael Horovitz, Frances Horovitz and Adam Horovitz have lived in the area.

==Culture==
Stroud is home to the Bardic Chair of Hawkwood, an annual competition held at Hawkwood College in May to select that year&#x27;s Bard who then has the responsibility to promote the bardic arts in the Stroud area. The folk-rock music group The Outcast Band come from Stroud, and also regularly headline the Stroud Fringe Festival.

==Sport==
Stroud Rugby Club, founded in 1873, plays in the Western Counties North league. Their home ground is Fromehall Park, near the town centre.

Stroud Cricket Club is over 150 years old and plays its home games at Farmhill. The club has three senior teams, with the first eleven playing its cricket in the South West Premier league.

Since 1982 Stroud Athletic Club has organised an annual half marathon which takes place in October. Nearly 2,500 runners, from all over the country, entered in 2007. Members of the club include the UK number one Olympic Marathon runner Dan Robinson.

Stroud Swimming Club was officially formed in 1978, but can trace its origins back to 1905 when it was known as Stroud Swimming and Water Polo Club. In 2006 and 2007 club members made up two-thirds of the County team that finished in silver and bronze places respectively in the National Open Water Championships.

Stroud Hockey Club was founded in 1928 and has produced some top-class hockey players including Simon Mason. The club has three men&#x27;s teams, three women&#x27;s teams and a boys Badgers and a girls Vixens team, and under 8s, 10s and 12s for rising club stars. The club&#x27;s home ground is at Stratford Park Leisure Centre, with training on Tuesday evenings during the season.

Forest Green Rovers is the nearest professional football club and play in . Their home ground is in Nailsworth, around 3.5 miles away. A lot of supporters live and come from Stroud and it is owned by Dale Vince who also owns Ecotricity.

The Stroud and District Football League is a local football competition for clubs in the area. The league was established in 1902 and is affiliated to the Gloucestershire County FA. It has a total of six divisions with the highest, Division One, sitting at level 14 of the English football league system. It is a feeder to the Gloucestershire Northern Senior League (GNSL) along with The North Gloucestershire League and The Cheltenham League.

==Politics and media==

Labour&#x27;s Dr Simon Opher unseated Conservative Siobhan Baillie in the 2024 general election. Siobhan Baillie was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Stroud, having beaten ex-Labour MP, David Drew, at the 2019 general election. Drew had previously represented the constituency from 1997 until 2010, when Conservative Neil Carmichael was elected, and from 2017 to 2019.

In March 2008, a community radio station, Stroud FM, was launched, broadcasting 24 hours a day on 107.9FM. The station, staffed by volunteers and funded by donations, focussed on local news and music, as well as national and international music, but closed in February 2014 due to a lack of funds. Both &quot;BBC Radio Gloucestershire&quot; and Heart West have dedicated FM and DAB transmitters serving the town.

Local TV coverage is provided by BBC West and ITV West Country.

There are now three local newspapers covering the town: the weekly &quot;Gloucester Citizen&quot;, now called &quot;Stroud Citizen&quot; to replace &quot;Stroud Life&quot;, published by Gloucestershire Media (part of the Northcliffe Group); the &quot;Stroud News &amp; Journal&quot;, published by Newsquest Media (Southern) Limited, part of the American Gannett Company and &quot;Stroud Times&quot; a hyper-local independent publication that launched online in March 2021 and in print the following year.

&quot;Stroud Life&quot; launched in 2008 and closed in October 2017. Most of its distribution was free direct to homes, but a significant share (about one-third) was sold through the news trade.

The &quot;Stroud News and Journal&quot; was formed by a merger in 1959 of the &quot;Stroud Journal&quot; (which started in 1854 as a Liberal-supporting newspaper) and the &quot;Stroud News&quot; (which started in 1867 and generally supported Conservative and Unionist interests).

&quot;Stroud Times&quot; was launched as an online-only venture in 2021 by &quot;Ash Loveridge&quot;, &quot;Carl Hewlett&quot; and &quot;Matt Bigwood&quot; all of whom formerly worked at The &quot;Stroud News and Journal&quot;.

==Recognition==
In a March 2021 guide, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; named Stroud the best place to live in the UK. The newspaper praised the town&#x27;s green spaces and independent spirit, as well as the quality of Stroud&#x27;s schools.

<doc id="324045" wikidata="Q1767872" url="?curid=324045" title="Coat of arms of British Columbia">
<text>The coat of arms of British Columbia is the heraldic symbol representing the Canadian province of British Columbia. The arms contain symbols reflecting British Columbia&#x27;s British heritage along with local symbols. At the upper part of the shield is the Union Jack, representing the United Kingdom. The lower portion of the shield features a golden sun setting into the ocean, representing the province&#x27;s location on the Pacific.

The original arms, consisting of only the shield, were granted by royal warrant of King Edward VII on 31 March 1906. The arms were further augmented with supporters, a crest, and a compartment, by royal warrant of Queen Elizabeth II on 15 October 1987.

A banner of arms comprises the provincial flag, which was adopted in 1960.

==History==

The first heraldic provincial symbol was the Great Seal of the province: the royal crest of the crowned lion upon the imperial crown, as was the usual practice for British colonies, but with the letters &quot;BC&quot; added. This design was created by Richard Clement Moody This design was used upon British Columbia joining Confederation.

The first coat of arms of the province was created by Canon Arthur Beanlands of Victoria, whose version was similar to the modern one: &quot;The union device of Great Britain and Ireland: on a chief barry undée argent and azure, a setting sun in base Or.&quot; This coat was adopted by Order-in-Council 268 July 19, 1895, as the arms and great seal of the province per the authority inferred from Section 136 of the British North America Act. Upon the order in council, the motto of the province is typeset incorrectly as , which is one of several hand-made corrections and deletions upon the instrument.

While the design of the great seal was a provincial prerogative, coats of arms were (and are) honours granted by the sovereign. The province attempted to register the design with the English College of Arms in 1897, but was unable to do so for several reasons. First among them was the use of the royal crest, which is the exclusive right of the sovereign and could not be granted to another entity even as a sign of utmost loyalty to the Queen. The heralds objected to the placement of the Union Flag in an inferior position on the shield (conflicting with the popular slogan, &quot;The sun never sets on the British Empire&quot;). The use of supporters, a high honour, was considered presumptuous, as no other province had been granted such a privilege.

The shield only (with the positions of the Union Flag and setting sun reversed, and with the antique crown added), along with the motto, was granted in 1906. The achievement of arms was augmented with a crest, supporters, and compartment granted by Queen Elizabeth II, on 15 October 1987.
==Symbolism==

;Crest
:The crest is the King&#x27;s royal crest for the United Kingdom (a gold lion &quot;statant gardant&quot;—standing on all fours and facing the viewer—wearing the royal crown), differenced with a garland of Pacific dogwood, the provincial flower.
;Shield
:The shield features a Union Flag in chief, with a crown (known heraldically as an antique crown) at its centre. In base it has the sun setting into the ocean, representing the province&#x27;s location on the Pacific.
;Compartment
:The compartment is a garland of Pacific Dogwood.
;Supporters
:The supporters are a wapiti (also known as elk) stag and a bighorn sheep. The wapiti of Vancouver Island and the bighorn sheep of the mainland of the province symbolize the union of the two colonies which united to form British Columbia in 1866
;Motto
:The motto , is Latin and refers to the idea of &quot;the sun never setting over the British Empire&quot;. (the form is the ablative, required after the preposition ) literally means a &quot;setting&quot; or a &quot;going down&quot;, such as of the sun, and by extension can refer to &quot;the west&quot;. While one can translate the phrase to mean &quot;splendour without diminishment&quot;, in combination with the geographical position of British Columbia (in the far west of the former British Empire), the setting sun shown on the shield, and the old concept of the sun never setting over the Empire, the motto should be understood to express the idea &quot;a shining without a sunset&quot;.

<doc id="324051" wikidata="Q628594" url="?curid=324051" title="Workers' Party (France, 1991–2008)">
<text>The Workers&#x27; Party (, PT) was a French Trotskyist party. It was formed by the Trotskyist Internationalist Communist Party (PCI), led by Pierre Boussel, better known under his pseudonym Pierre Lambert, together with a number of other socialists with whom they worked in the Force Ouvrière union confederation.

Within the &quot;PT&quot; the former &quot;PCI&quot; was known as the Internationalist Communist Organisation. In reality, despite including communist, socialist and anarcho-syndicalist tendencies the &quot;PT&quot; was generally regarded as little more than a front for the Trotskyist &quot;PCI&quot;.

Its national secretary was Daniel Gluckstein (pseudonym: Seldjouk), who received less than 0.5% in the 2002 French presidential election.

Gérard Schivardi, a candidate in the 2007 presidential elections under the &quot;PT&quot;, gained 0.34% of the votes. In the 10 and 17 June 2007 French National Assembly elections, the party won no seats. Despite these low national results, the &quot;PT&quot; polled better in local elections.

The &quot;PT&quot; published a magazine called &quot;Informations Ouvrières&quot; (&quot;Workers&#x27; News&quot;).

In June 2008, the &quot;PT&quot; was dissolved into the new Independent Workers&#x27; Party (&quot;Parti ouvrier indépendant&quot;).

<doc id="324056" wikidata="Q21604080" url="?curid=324056" title="Braintree and Bocking">
<text>Braintree and Bocking was an urban district in Essex, England. It was created in 1934 as a merger of the old urban district of Braintree with the neighbouring parish of Bocking. The district was abolished in 1974 and now forms part of the wider Braintree District.

== History ==
The parish of Braintree had been governed by a local board from 1850. Such local boards were reconstituted as urban district councils in 1894. By the early 1930s the urban area of Braintree was growing beyond its historic parish boundaries, particularly into the parish of Bocking to the north. On 1 April 1934 a new parish and urban district called &quot;Braintree and Bocking&quot; was created, covering the area of the former urban district and parish of Braintree and the parish of Bocking, which were abolished. At the same time there were also some adjustments to the boundaries with the neighbouring parishes of Black Notley, Gosfield, Rayne and Stisted.

The council was based at Braintree Town Hall in the Market Square in Braintree, which had been built in 1928 for the old Braintree Urban District Council.

On 1 April 1974, Braintree and Bocking Urban District was abolished and merged with Braintree Rural District, Halstead Rural District, Halstead Urban District and Witham Urban District to form a new non-metropolitan district called Braintree. No successor parish was created for the former Braintree and Bocking Urban district and so it became an unparished area. As of 2023 the former Braintree and Bocking Urban District remains the only unparished area in Braintree district; proposals for it to be made a parish have been considered but not pursued. Halstead had a successor parish and Witham was parished in 1982.

The name &quot;Braintree and Bocking&quot; continues to be used by some local organisations based in the area, such as the Braintree and Bocking Public Gardens Trust.

<text>Community-based economics or community economics is an economic system that encourages local substitution. It is similar to the lifeways of those practicing voluntary simplicity, including traditional Mennonite, Amish, and modern eco-village communities. It is also a subject in urban economics, related to moral purchasing and local purchasing.

The community-based economy can refer to the various initiatives coordinated through multiple forms of interactions. These interactions may involve some form of work performance; project participation; and/or relationship exchange. The forms of interaction can exclude the need to contract; can do away with the need to include some form of monetisation; as well as be free from the need to establish a structure of hierarchy. Community-based economies have been seen to involve aspects of social bonding; value promotion; and establishing community-orientated social goals.

It has been suggested that communities that meet their own needs need the global economy less. &quot;Local-economy theory&quot; introduces insights 
into new economic development that honours ecological realities and finds efficiencies in small-scale, shared knowledge at the community level.

Community-based economies have been seen to focus on the idea that the “local community should be the focal point of development”. In addition, resources and skills which are sourced locally are seen to play a pivotal role in the community. A community economies approach is interested in diverse activities that contribute to the well-being of both people and the planet. Such actions seek to help people survive well; produce and distribute surplus; transact goods and services more fairly; and invest in ways to support a better future. A community economies approach involves identifying and acknowledging the economic activities that contribute to the well-being of people and the planet and considers ways that these activities may strengthen and multiply. Community-based economics starts by acknowledging the local context and valuing the diverse economic activities and possibilities already present.

In the Philippines, the Jenga Community Partnering Project involved working with groups of community members to build on existing individual and community assets. Community economies researchers point out that the &#x27;community&#x27; in community economies is not about pre-existing communities (such as those based on a shared identity or location). Instead, the community is a process of being with others, including the world around.

== Investment and poverty alleviation ==
Community-based development is a form of decentralisation that &quot;devolves authority to the most local community level&quot;. Economic development projects target the poor, often in developing countries. There have been mixed results from a limited number of studies endeavouring to explore the potential for success from community-based decentralised programs. The World Bank is on record to have increased funding for community-based development from a minimum of $325 million in 1996 to a minimum of $3 billion in 2003.

Community approaches to poverty reduction address social problems that governments and the voluntary sector usually address. However, these typically incorporate methods employed by the private sector.

Community-based tourism (CBT) has been advanced as a strategy associated with community development and poverty alleviation through tourism. CBT &quot;has become one of the sector&#x27;s fastest-growing segments globally...&quot;. It is a form of tourism that started in the 1970s and is explicitly aimed at disadvantaged communities. Common challenges are linked to the scarcity of material and non-material (such as skill and education) of poor community members.

=== China ===
In 2001, China began a community-driven program for the purpose of reducing poverty levels. “Participatory village planning” was seen to have been used to promote public investments in targeted villages with higher levels of poverty. There had been programs prior to 2001 in China where investments were made to try to reduce poverty, however, these did not include much participation from the communities themselves. In the current program, each village conducts a public investment plan where projects are voted on by the village residents themselves. The government-initiated program being run in China since 2001 is one of few examples of community-based economics at play, with limited to no participation from international donors.

=== Nepal ===
Cooperatives play a vital role in community-based poverty reduction programs. The first multipurpose cooperative in Nepal was established in 1956. The purpose of establishing the cooperative was to help support the rehabilitation of flood victims.

=== United States ===
The Amish community are an example of economic development being possible without complete modernisation. Profit is given less importance to religion and its values.
Farmers in the Amish community refrain from using modern technological equipment and still find ways to sell their products at market prices and make profits. By engaging in the wider economy, the Amish community are better able to deal with population growth, land price increases, as well as rises in costs of goods and services not being produced by the Amish community itself. As such, the Amish still find themselves subject to the economic factors of supply and demand changes, rapid changes in legal and political environments, as well the impacts of globalisation.

== Environmental sustainability and natural resource preservation ==

Due to the hybrid nature of many community-based natural resource management approaches, governance actors from higher than just the local community level are often involved. As such, approaches can differ widely with respect to the composition of participants. Different governance functions can be performed by different actors from different societal spheres and at different levels.

Community-based approaches may overlook or neglect broader social processes. Some communities may be too poor or conflict-ridden to be able to help themselves; &#x27;participation fatigue&#x27; can be present, and power differentials can lead to inequitable outcomes.

&quot;Bioregional and ecological economics theory describes the growth of local economic linkages as vital to moving post-industrial economies toward sustainability&quot;. Growing economic links involves engaging local communities to the point where they have meaningful levels of ownership over their environmental and financial resources, in order to focus on the production of resources to meet localised needs. This pattern is becoming more familiar in many parts of North America and Europe. As currently practised, Green Community Economic Development (GCED) schemes involve extending ideas to finance local economic initiatives. These initiatives feature energy and other conservation measures and environmental remediation as an essential job creation focus&quot;.

=== Australia ===
Government agencies and community groups have protocols for engaging with Aboriginal communities. In regional Australia, resource management practitioners apply projects according to engagement protocols transferred from remote Australia. Various state governments in Australia devolve powers to regional organisations to decide how to invest public funds in environmental management. This model is an example of a community based economic approach to ecological management. This approach is one that the Australian state governments have justified based on the potential benefits of developing the capacities of landholders and other stakeholders. 
Stakeholders then respond self-reliantly (both as individuals and in groups) to the environmental challenges.

=== Nepal ===
The state government of Nepal set up the Community Forestry programme in 1978, an initiative that saw community members being given full rights for the protection of forests. Around twenty thousand community forest user groups, including under two and a half million households are involved in the management of around two million hectares of community forest in Nepal.

=== United States ===
In many rural communities across the west of the United States, (community-based organisations (CBO)), grassroots non-profit entities focusing on revitalising their respective communities through linked natural resource stewardship and rural economic development activities, have emerged to provide direction and practical solutions to natural resource management dilemmas and social conflict. CBOs seek to help communities cope with policy and economic transitions.

== Indigenous communities ==

=== Australia ===
Since the 1970s, Indigenous communities in Australia have played leading roles in building procuring community-based services in areas such as local governing; health; housing; as well as welfare.

In Australia, a five-year research project called &#x27;People on Country (POC), Healthy Landscapes and Indigenous Economic Futures&#x27; was undertaken by the Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research at the Australian National University. This project was collaborative in nature, where the University worked with a number of community-based Aboriginal land and sea management groups in northern Australia. Work was carried out on a number of cultural and resource management issues.

=== Malawi ===

Many community-based economies have been seen in the Kasungu district of Malawi. These economies have concerned themselves with the tasks of sustaining agriculture; managing natural resources; facilitating small and medium enterprises; as well as dealing with health problems in their communities such as HIV and AIDS.

The Ngolowindo Horticultural Cooperative Society (NHCS) is one such example of community-based economies at play. It is located in the “Maganga Traditional Authority in the Salima District of Malawi&#x27;s Central Regions”. The NHCS includes members from the eleven villages surrounding it and was initially known as the “Ngolowindo Self Help Irrigation Scheme (NSHIS)”. The NSHIS had seen support from the areas’ indigenous leaders. Apart from seeking to implement subsistence farming, the NHCS deals with generational income issues by focusing on achieving stability at the household level.

=== New Zealand ===
The importance of relationships was seen in the early Māori economy. Concepts such as reciprocity; flexibility; sustainability and sharing (trade) underpinned these relationships. Not only were these relationships regarded as between people, but between people and the physical world, as well as between people and the spiritual world.

<doc id="324066" wikidata="Q27981" url="?curid=324066" title="Hopscotch">
<text>Hopscotch is a popular playground game in which players toss a small object, called a lagger, into numbered triangles or a pattern of rectangles outlined on the ground and then hop or jump through the spaces and retrieve the object. It is a children&#x27;s game that can be played with several players or alone. Hopscotch is a physical and cognitive workout.

== Court and rules ==

=== The court ===
To play hopscotch, a court is first laid out on the ground. Depending on the available surface, the court is either scratched out in the dirt or drawn with chalk on pavement. Courts may be permanently marked where playgrounds are commonly paved, as in elementary schools. Designs vary, but the court is usually composed of a series of linear squares interspersed with blocks of two lateral squares. Traditionally the court ends with a &quot;safe&quot; or &quot;home&quot; base in which the player may turn before completing the reverse trip. The home base may be a square, a rectangle, or a semicircle. The squares are then numbered in the sequence in which they are to be hopped.

=== Playing the game ===
The first player tosses a marker onto the court. The marker (typically a small stone, coin, bean bag, or small chain with a charm) should land in the square without bouncing, sliding, or rolling out. (In Scotland and Ireland, the marker is usually replaced with an old shoe polish tin or flat stone, called a piggy.) In the United States the marker was called a “lagger” and in the 1940s Hopscotch Laggers made of rubber were sold by the Hoppy Taw Company of Utah. The marker must be thrown in sequential numerical order completely within the square without touching the line. The player then hops through the course, skipping the marker&#x27;s square. Single squares must be hopped on one foot, except for the first single square, where either foot may be used. Side-by-side squares are straddled, with the left foot landing in the left square, and the right foot landing in the right square. Optional squares marked &quot;Safe&quot;, &quot;Home&quot;, or &quot;Rest&quot; are neutral squares, and may be hopped through in any manner without penalty. After hopping into &quot;Safe&quot;, &quot;Home&quot;, or &quot;Rest&quot;, the player must then turn around and retrace their steps through the course on one or two legs, depending on the square, until reaching the marker&#x27;s square. The player stops in the square before the marker and reaches down to retrieve the marker and continue the course as stated, without touching a line or stepping into a square with another player&#x27;s marker.

Upon successfully completing the sequence, the player continues the turn by tossing the marker into square number two, and repeating the pattern.

If, while hopping through the court in either direction, the player steps on a line, misses a square, or loses balance, the turn ends. Players begin their turns where they last left off. The first player to complete one course for every numbered square on the court wins the game.

Although the marker is most often picked up during the game, historically, in the boy&#x27;s game, the marker was kicked sequentially back through the course on the return trip and then kicked out.

== Origin ==
According to Ulrich Schädler, the origin of hopscotch is still enigmatic, although he firmly states it is an early modern game. Nonetheless, there are claims for a greater age of this game.
B. B. Lal states (without evidence) that hopscotch was played 1200 to 600–500 BCE during the Painted Grey ware era of India. Among the games prohibited by Buddha there is an entry that is reminiscent of hopscotch, but not specific enough to enable us to actually identify the game.
Despite speculation that an ancient form of hopscotch was played by Roman children and soldiers, there is no evidence for this.

The first recorded references to the game in the English-speaking world date to the late seventeenth century, usually under the name &quot;scotch-hop&quot; or &quot;scotch-hopper(s)&quot;. A manuscript &quot;Book of Games&quot; compiled between 1635 and 1672 by Francis Willughby refers to &#x27;Scotch Hopper‥. They play with a piece of tile or a little flat piece of lead, upon a boarded floor, or any area divided into oblong figures like boards&#x27;. In Poor Robin&#x27;s Almanack for 1677, the game is referred to as &quot;Scotch-hoppers&quot;. The entry states, &quot;The time when schoolboys should play at Scotch-hoppers.&quot; The 1707 edition of Poor Robin&#x27;s Almanack includes the following phrase... &quot;Lawyers and Physicians have little to do this month, so they may (if they will) play at Scotch-hoppers.&quot; In 1828, Webster&#x27;s &quot;American Dictionary of the English Language&quot; also referred to the game as &#x27;Scotch-hopper&#x27; ... &#x27;a play in which boys hop over scotches and lines in the ground.&#x27;

=== Etymology ===
According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the etymology of &quot;hopscotch&quot; is a formation from the words &quot;hop&quot; and &quot;&quot;, the latter in the sense of &quot;an incised line or scratch&quot;. The journal of the British Archaeological Association, volume 26 (dated March 9, 1870) states: &quot;The sport of Hop-Scotch or Scotch-Hoppers is called in Yorkshire &#x27;Hop-Score&#x27;, and in Suffolk &#x27;Scotch Hobbies or Hobby&#x27;, from the boy who gets on the player&#x27;s back whilst hopping or &#x27;hicking&#x27;, as it is there termed; and in Scotland it is known as &#x27;Peevers, Peeverels, and Pabats&#x27;&quot;.

== Variations ==

There are many other forms of hopscotch played across the globe. In India it is called &quot;Stapu&quot; or &quot;Kit Kit&quot; in Hindi, &quot;Nondi/Paandi&quot; (Tamil), &quot;Thokkudu billa&quot; (Telugu) or &quot;Kith-Kith&quot;. In Spain and some Latin American countries, it is called &quot;rayuela&quot;, although it may also be known as &quot;golosa&quot; or &quot;charranca&quot;. In France &quot;marelle&quot; is the name for the game.

In Turkey, it is &quot;Seksek&quot; (from &quot;sek&quot;, &quot;to hop&quot;). In Russian it is known as &quot;классики&quot; (&quot;klássiki&quot;, diminutive for the word meaning &quot;classes&quot;). In Bulgaria, the game is referred to as &quot;дама&quot; (&quot;dama&quot;) which means &quot;lady&quot;.

In Poland, it appears in two forms: &quot;klasy&quot; (&quot;classes&quot;) which has a rectangular shape and no marker (instead, players call out names of various items of a given class, e.g. colours or flowers, while jumping on successive fields); and &quot;pajac&quot; (&quot;buffoon&quot;) which has a human shape and uses a thrown marker, e.g. a piece of glass or stone.

In Sweden the game is named &quot;hoppa hage&quot; (lit. &quot;jumping the garden&quot;), while in Norway it is called &quot;paradis&quot;, or Paradise. In Italy the game is known as &quot;campana&quot; (meaning &quot;bell&quot;), or &quot;mondo&quot; (&quot;world&quot;). In the Netherlands and Flanders, it is called &quot;Hinkelen&quot; (&quot;skip&quot;). In Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia it is called &quot;školica&quot;, meaning &quot;little school&quot;. In Malaysia, the most popular variant is called &quot;tengteng&quot;.

In Mexico, it is called &quot;bebeleche (mamaleche)&quot; meaning &quot;drink milk&quot; or &quot;avioncito&quot; meaning &quot;little plane&quot;, after its shape. In Cuba and in Puerto Rico it is called &quot;La Peregrina&quot; (meaning &quot;Pilgrim Girl&quot;) and the squares represent the 9 rings the pilgrim traveler has to pass in order to reach Heaven from Purgatory, according to Dante&#x27;s Inferno.

In Romania the game is called &quot;șotron&quot; and is widely played by children all over the country. In Denmark it is called &quot;hinke&quot;. In Brazil it is called &quot;amarelinha&quot;, evolved from &quot;marelle&quot;, the French name for the game that became too closely associated with the radical &quot;amarelo&quot; (yellow) and its diminutive in -inho/a.

In Breton, the name is &quot;reg&quot; or &quot;delech&quot;. The Albanian variant is called &quot;rrasavi&quot;, which is composed of two words: &quot;rrasa&quot; (&quot;the flat stone&quot;, an object used to play the game) and &quot;vi&quot; (&quot;line&quot;, a reference to the lines that comprise the diagram of the course). In China, hopscotch is called &quot;tiao fangzi&quot; (&quot;跳房子&quot;, meaning &quot;jumping the houses&quot;).

In the Philippines, hopscotch is called &quot;piko&quot; in Tagalog and sometimes also called &quot;kiki&quot; or Bikabix in Visayas/Cebuano, Kingking in Ilocos region (northern part of Luzon). Its common court in the Philippines has six squares.

In India, hopscotch is called &quot;thikrya&quot;, because broken stones called &quot;thikrya&quot; are slid across the grid as players hop to each square. In South Korea, hopscotch is called &quot;sabangchigi&quot; (&quot;사방치기&quot;, meaning &quot;Hitting the Four Cardinal Directions&quot;) and is widely played across the nation. In Ghana, hopscotch is called &quot;tumatu&quot; and is mostly played by children.

In Zimbabwe, the game is called pada and its mostly played by girls. In America the game is referred to as Hop Scotch and is played with a marker. It is found on elementary school playgrounds and is an activity most often played by girls.

=== Persian: Laylay (or Khane bazi) ===

The hopscotch game&#x27;s generic name in Persian is Laylay. The most common form of Laylay in Iran resembles the older Western types and uses six or more (always an even number) side-by-side squares successively (vertically) numbered. The player uses a peg or a flat stone that the player must kick to the next square as the player is hopping. If either the stone or a player&#x27;s foot lands on a line, the player forfeits the game (or loses a turn). Although somewhat less common, the contemporary Western type also is played.

=== Glasgow: Peevers or Peever ===
In the Glasgow area, the hopscotch game is called &quot;beds&quot; or &quot;Peever(s)&quot;. &quot;Peever&quot; is also the name of the object which is slid across the grid to land in a square. In the 1950s and 1960s in Glasgow, it was common for the peever to be a shoe polish tin filled with stones or dirt and screwed shut.

Edinburgh children also call the game Peevers, played on a Peever bed with a chalked grid and a small flat tin - like a puck, where the chalk is stored during the game with the ballast.

=== French: Marelle, Escargot ===
&quot;Marelle&quot; is the name of the traditional hopscotch game in France, but a variant there is known as &quot;escargot&quot; (snail) or &quot;marelle ronde&quot; (round hopscotch). The variant is played on a spiral course. Players must hop on one foot to the center of the spiral and then reverse their path to back out again.

If the player reaches the center without stepping on a line or losing balance he or she marks one square with his or her initials, and from then on may place two feet in that square, while all other players must hop over it. The game ends when all squares are marked or no one can reach the center and the winner is the player who &quot;owns&quot; the most squares.

=== German: Himmel und Hölle ===
In Germany, Austria, and Switzerland the hopscotch game is called &quot;Himmel und Hölle&quot; (Heaven and Hell) although some other names are used, as well, depending on the region. The square below &quot;1&quot; or the &quot;1&quot; itself, is called &quot;Erde&quot; (Earth) while the second to last square is the &quot;Hölle&quot; (Hell) and the last one is &quot;Himmel&quot; (Heaven). The first player throws a small stone into the first square and then jumps to the square and must kick the stone to the next square and so on, however, neither the stone nor the player may stop in &quot;Hell&quot; so they try to skip that square.

=== India: Kith-Kith ===

In India, hopscotch is also called &quot;Kith-Kith&quot;, &quot;Stapu&quot;, &quot;Langdi&quot; in the Hindi-speaking areas, or &quot;Ekhaat Duhaat&quot; or &quot;Ekka Dukka&quot; in Bengal, &quot;Tipri Pani&quot; in Maharashtra, Kunte bille in Karnataka, Paandi in Tamil Nadu, and Tokkudu Billa in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. These games have similar principles in that players must hop on one foot and must throw the marker in the right square. The game is enjoyed by kids throughout the country.

=== New York City: Potsy ===
Potsy is the name of a hopscotch game that was played in New York City. The name probably refers to a &quot;potsherd&quot; that was used as a marker.

=== Brazil: Amarelinha ===
In Brazil, this game is called Amarelinha.

=== Spanish-speaking countries ===

In Spain, and several South American countries (Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Uruguay), the name of the hopscotch game is &quot;Rayuela&quot;, However, it may also be known as golosa or charranca. In Chile, this game is called Luche. (Following some cultural evolution, &quot;rayuela&quot; is now applied to a throwing game in Chile.) In Mexico, the game is called bebeleche (mamaleche) meaning &quot;drink milk&quot; or avioncito meaning &quot;little plane&quot;, after its shape. In Cuba and in Puerto Rico it is called &quot;La Peregrina&quot;

==Longest design==
During the COVID-19 pandemic, in April 2020 a giant hopscotch game with nearly 1,000 squares was created in Edinburgh, to be used while following social distancing rules.

==World record==
The current &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; holder for the fastest hopscotch game is Ashrita Furman, at 1 minute and 2 seconds.

==In popular culture==

*A hopscotch court drawn such that the area where the final step would be is instead a sheer drop such as a building or cliff, such that any participant would fall to their death upon completion, is a motif occasionally seen in fiction, sometimes as a device for black comedy.
**A notable example is featured on the cover of the Korn album &quot;Follow the Leader&quot;, which focuses on a young girl participating in the game at a cliff. The concept was described by Jonathan Davis as representing a loss of innocence.
*A 2010 PBS documentary, &quot;New York Street Games&quot;, includes &quot;potsy&quot;, described as a &quot;girl&#x27;s game&quot; in the film.
*Julio Cortázar based his novel &quot;Hopscotch&quot; on this game.

<text>Operation Haven Denial was a U.S.-led operation (July 2–6, 2003) against Taliban remnants and Al Qaeda fighters in the Paktika and Khost provinces of Afghanistan. The operation involved 800 U.S soldiers backed by more than 500 Italian paratroopers and by 25 aircraft.

One illegal border checkpoint was dismantled and one small cache of weapons was confiscated. Some 250 vehicles were inspected and 400 people interviewed, but no one was detained during the operation.

It was the biggest operation in Afghanistan since Operation Anaconda in March 2002.

<text>Nikolaj Frederik Severin Grundtvig (; 8 September 1783 – 2 September 1872), most often referred to as N. F. S. Grundtvig, was a Danish pastor, author, poet, philosopher, historian, teacher and politician. He was one of the most influential people in Danish history, as his philosophy gave rise to a new form of nationalism in the last half of the 19th century. It was steeped in the national literature and supported by deep spirituality.

Grundtvig holds a unique position in the cultural history of his country. Grundtvig and his followers are credited with being very influential in the formulation of modern Danish national consciousness. He was active during the Danish Golden Age, but his style of writing and fields of reference are not immediately accessible to a foreigner, thus his international importance does not match that of his contemporaries Hans Christian Andersen and Søren Kierkegaard.

== Early life and education ==

Called Frederik rather than Nikolaj by those close to him. N. F. S. Grundtvig was the son of a Lutheran pastor in Udby, Johan Ottosen Grundtvig (1734–1813) and was born there. He was brought up in a very religious atmosphere, although his mother also had great respect for old Norse legends and traditions. He was schooled in the tradition of the European Enlightenment, but his faith in reason was also influenced by German romanticism and the ancient history of the Nordic countries.

In 1791 he was sent to Thyregod in Central Jutland to live and study with pastor Laurids Svindt Feld (1750–1803). He subsequently studied at the Aarhus Katedralskole, the cathedral school of Aarhus, from 1798 until graduation. He left for Copenhagen in 1800 to study theology and was accepted to the University of Copenhagen in 1801. At the close of his university life, Grundtvig began to study Icelandic and the Icelandic Sagas.

== Career ==

In 1805, Grundtvig took a position as tutor in a house on the island of Langeland. The next three years he used his free time to study writers Shakespeare, Schiller, and Fichte. In 1802, his cousin, the philosopher Henrich Steffens, returned to Copenhagen full of the teaching of Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling. His lectures and the early poetry of Adam Oehlenschläger opened Grundtvig&#x27;s eyes to the new era in literature. His first work, &quot;On the Songs in the Edda&quot;, attracted no attention.

Returning to Copenhagen in 1808, Grundtvig achieved greater success with his &quot;Northern Mythology&quot;, and again in 1809 with a long drama, &quot;The Fall of the Heroic Life in the North&quot;. Grundtvig boldly denounced the clergy of the city in his first sermon in 1810. When Grundtvig published the sermon three weeks later it offended the ecclesiastical authorities, and they demanded him punished.

In 1810, Grundtvig underwent a religious crisis and converted to a strongly held Lutheranism. He retired to his father&#x27;s country parish in Udby as his chaplain. His new-found conviction was expressed in his &quot;The First World Chronicle&quot; () of 1812, a presentation of European history in which he attempted to explain how belief in God has been viewed throughout human history and in which he criticized the ideology of many prominent Danes. It won him notoriety among his peers and cost him several friends, notably the historian Christian Molbech. Upon his father&#x27;s death in 1813, Grundtvig applied to be his successor in the parish but was rejected.

In the following years his rate of publication was staggering: aside from a continuing stream of articles and poems, he wrote a number of books, including two more histories of the world (1814 and 1817); the long historical poem &quot;Roskilde-Riim&quot; (&quot;Rhyme of Roskilde&quot;; 1813); and a book-sized commentary, &quot;Roskilde Saga&quot;. From 1816 to 1819 he was editor of and almost sole contributor to a philosophical and polemical journal entitled &quot;Danne-Virke&quot;, which also published poetry.

From 1813 to 1815, he attempted to form a movement to support the Norwegians against the Swedish government. Later he preached on how the weakness of the Danish faith was the cause of the loss of Norway in 1814. His sermon was met by an enthusiastic congregation in Copenhagen. Grundtvig withdrew from the pulpit because he did not have a parish of his own and was being barred by other churches. In 1821, he resumed preaching briefly when granted the country living of Præstø, and returned to the capital the year after.
In 1825, Grundtvig published a pamphlet, &quot;The Church&#x27;s Rejoinder&quot; (), a response to Henrik Nicolai Clausen&#x27;s work on the doctrines, rites, and constitutions of Protestantism and Roman Catholicism. A professor of theology at the University of Copenhagen, Clausen argued that although the Bible was the principal foundation of Christianity, it was in itself an inadequate expression of its full meaning. He described the church as a &quot;community for the purpose of advancing general religiousness&quot;. In his reply, Grundtvig denounced Clausen as an anti-Christian teacher and argued that Christianity was not a theory to be derived from the Holy Bible and elaborated by scholars. He questioned the right of theologians to interpret the Bible. Grundtvig was publicly prosecuted for libel and fined. The Church of Denmark forbade him to preach for seven years. During this time he published a collection of theological works, visited England three times (1829–31), and studied Anglo-Saxon.

In 1832, Grundtvig obtained permission to again enter active ministry. In 1839, he was called as pastor of the workhouse church of Vartov hospital in Copenhagen, a post he held until his death. Between 1837 and 1841 he published &quot;Sang-Værk til den Danske Kirke&quot; (Song Work for the Danish Church), a rich collection of sacred poetry; in 1838 he brought out a selection of early Scandinavian verse; in 1840 he edited the Anglo-Saxon poem &quot;The Phoenix&quot;, with a Danish translation. In 1843 he visited England for a fourth time.

From 1844 until after the First Schleswig War, Grundtvig took a prominent part in politics, developing from a conservative into an absolute liberal. In 1848 he was part of the Danish Constituent Assembly that wrote the first constitution of Denmark. In 1861 he received the titular rank of Bishop in the Church of Denmark, but without a see. He continued to write and publish until his death. He spoke from the pulpit at Vartov Church every Sunday until a few days before his death. His preaching attracted large congregations, and he soon had a following. His hymn book effected a great change in Danish church services, substituting the hymns of the national poets for the slow measures of the orthodox Lutherans. In all Grundtvig wrote or translated about 1500 hymns, including &quot;God&#x27;s Word Is Our Great Heritage&quot; and &quot;Det kimer nu til julefest&quot;.

== Christian thinking ==
Grundtvig&#x27;s theological development continued over his lifetime, and took a number of important turns. He moved from his &quot;Christian awakening&quot; of 1810 to believing in a congregational and sacramental Christianity in later years. He was most notable for the latter thinking. He always called himself a pastor, not a theologian, reflecting the distance between his ideas and academic theology. The chief characteristic of his theology was the substitution of the authority of the &quot;living word&quot; for the apostolic commentaries. He desired to see each congregation act as a practically independent community.

Even though he was a staunch Christian, Grundtvig&#x27;s obsession with the pre-Christian Scandinavian faith lasted throughout his life. At the time this faith had no official name, but were merely known as &quot;Forn Siðr&quot; - &quot;the old customs&quot;. Therefore as part of his studies and works on this old faith, he coined the name &quot;Asatro&quot; or &quot;Asetro&quot;, a name which holds a double meaning. The meaning can either be interpretated as &quot;the Aesir faith&quot; or &quot;loyal to the Aesir&quot;.

== Thought on education ==
Grundtvig is the ideological father of the folk high school, though his own ideas on education had another focus. He advocated reforming the ailing Sorø Academy into a popular school aiming at another form of higher education than what was common at the university. Rather than educating learned scholars, he believed the university should educate its students for active participation in society and popular life. Thus practical skills as well as national poetry and history should form an essential part of the instruction. This idea came very close to implementation during the reign of King Christian VIII, whose wife Caroline Amalie was an ardent supporter of Grundtvig. The death of the monarch in 1848 and the dramatic political development in Denmark during this and the following years put an end to these plans. However, by that time, one of Grundtvig&#x27;s supporters, Kristen Kold, had already established the first folk high school.

Grundtvig&#x27;s ambitions for school reform were not limited to the popular folk high school. He also dreamed of forming a Great Nordic University (the School for Passion) to be situated at the symbolic point of intersection between the three Scandinavian countries in Gothenburg, Sweden. The two pillars of his school program, the School for Life (folk high school) and the School for Passion (university) were aimed at quite different horizons of life. The popular education should mainly be taught within a national and patriotic horizon of understanding, yet always keeping an open mind towards a broader cultural and intercultural outlook, while the university should work from a strictly universal, i.e. humane and scientific, outlook.

The common denominator of all Grundtvig&#x27;s pedagogical efforts was to promote a spirit of freedom, poetry and disciplined creativity, within all branches of educational life. He promoted values such as wisdom, compassion, identification and equality. He opposed all compulsion, including exams, as deadening to the human soul. Instead Grundtvig advocated unleashing human creativity according to the universally creative order of life. Only &quot;willing hands make light work&quot;. Therefore, a spirit of freedom, cooperation and discovery was to be kindled in individuals, in science, and in the civil society as a whole.

== Beowulf and Anglo-Saxon literature ==
In 1815, Grímur Jónsson Thorkelin published the first edition of the titled in a Latin translation. Despite his lack of knowledge of Anglo-Saxon literature, Grundtvig quickly discovered a number of flaws in Thorkelin&#x27;s rendering of the poems. After his heated debate with Thorkelin, Johan Bülow (1751–1828), who had sponsored Thorkelin&#x27;s work, offered to support a new translation by Grundtvig — this time into Danish. The result, Bjovulfs Drape (1820), was the first full translation of Beowulf into a modern language (previously, only selections of the poem had been translated into modern English by Sharon Turner in 1805).

Grundtvig went on to explore the extensive literature of the Anglo-Saxons which survived in Old English and Latin. In both poetry and prose, it revealed the spirituality of the early Church in Northern Europe. Grundtvig was very influenced by these ancient models of Christian and historical thought (notably the 8th-century Bede&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;, written in Latin). Using the resources of the Royal Library in Copenhagen and of the libraries at the universities of Exeter, Oxford, and Cambridge in three successive summer visits to England (1829–1831), he went on to make transcriptions of two of the four great codices of Anglo-Saxon poetry: the &quot;Exeter Book&quot; and the codex designated &quot;Junius 11&quot; in the Bodleian Library at Oxford. Although he thought to publish them, the project was never realized. &quot;Beowulf&quot; and Anglo-Saxon literature continued to be a major source of inspiration to Grundtvig. It had a wide-ranging influence upon his work.

== Marriage and family ==
Grundtvig was married three times, the last time in his 76th year. His first wife, Elisabeth Blicher (1787–1851), was a clergyman&#x27;s daughter. They were married in 1818 and had three children. His second wife, Marie Toft (1813–1854) was the daughter of a landowner. She died a few months after giving birth to a son. In 1858, he married Asta Reedtz (1826–1890) of an old aristocratic Danish family. His son Svend Grundtvig (1824–1883) collected and edited Danish ballads.

== Legacy ==

* Grundtvig&#x27;s Church in the Copenhagen district of Bispebjerg was designed by Danish architect Peder Vilhelm Jensen-Klint as a memorial to Grundtvig. Built of yellow brick in a Neo-Gothic expressionist style, it was completed in 1940.
* Grundtvig International Secondary School in Nigeria is also named after him, It is an independent co-educational secondary School.
* His hymn &quot;De Levendes Land&quot; was chosen in 2006 as an item in the &quot;Lyrikantologi&quot; which forms part of the Literature section of the Danish Culture Canon.

=== Editions ===
No comprehensive foreign language edition of his work exists. A three-volume edition in German, however, is under preparation and projects for an English edition are in progress as well. Grundtvig&#x27;s secular poetical works were published in a nine-volume edition, the first seven volumes by his second son, the philologist Svend Grundtvig. The philological practice of this work, however, is not up to the standards of modern philology. His hymns have been collected in the philologically more stable five-volume edition &quot;Grundtvigs Sang-Værk&quot;.

The best overall collection of his writings in print is the ten-volume edition &quot;Grundtvigs udvalgte Skrifter&quot; edited by Holger Begtrup (1859–1937). His enormous oeuvre is presented in Steen Johansen: &quot;Bibliografi over N.F.S. Grundtvigs Skrifter&quot; (I-IV, 1948–54).

<text>7th Heaven is an American family drama television series created and produced by Brenda Hampton. The series debuted on August 26, 1996, on The WB, where it aired for ten seasons, making it the longest-running series in the history of The WB. Following the shutdown of The WB and its merger with UPN to form The CW, the series aired on The CW on September 25, 2006, for its eleventh and final season, airing its final episode on May 13, 2007. &quot;7th Heaven&quot; was one of the network&#x27;s first major successful shows and, alongside &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, helped in the early success of the WB during the mid to late 1990s. It was also the last series to be produced by Spelling Television (later produced by CBS Paramount Network Television for the eleventh and final season) before the company was shut down and became an in-name-only unit of CBS Television Studios.

==Premise==
The series follows Reverend Eric Camden, a Protestant minister living in the fictional town of Glen Oak, California, and his wife Annie as they deal with the drama of raising 7 children (twins Sam and David come later in the series) ranging in age from babies to adults with families of their own.

==Episodes==

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
The Parents Television Council (PTC), a conservative media advocacy group, often cited &quot;7th Heaven&quot; among the top ten most family-friendly shows. The show was praised for its positive portrayal of a cleric and for promoting honesty, respect for parental authority, and the importance of a strong family and a good education through its story-lines. It was proclaimed the best show in 1998-1999 by the PTC. The council also explained &quot;&quot;7th Heaven&quot; manages to provide moral solutions to tough issues facing teenagers without seeming preachy or heavy-handed. Additionally, unlike most TV series, &quot;7th Heaven&quot; shows the consequences of reckless and irresponsible behavior.&quot; It was also noted that &quot;While addressing topics such as premarital sex and peer pressure, these parents [Annie and Eric] are eager to provide wise counsel along with love and understanding.&quot;

However, other critics felt quite differently about the show. Hillary Frey of Salon cited &quot;7th Heaven&quot; as &quot;one of the worst long-running shows on television, making &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; look Shakespearean, while at the same time being one of the most addictive.&quot; Reasons given include perceived heavy-handed moralizing, Christian propaganda, and depiction of a caricature of a real family, that is &quot;so clean it is obscene&quot;.

Some criticize the predictable storytelling of &quot;7th Heaven&quot;. Frey describes the basic pattern followed by each episode: 
&quot;(1) One of the Camden family has a problem and/or secret; (2) some sort of &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;-esque misunderstanding ensues as a result of that problem and/or secret; (3) a confrontation and/or intervention takes place, usually involving a short sermon delivered by one of the Camden parents; and (4) whoever stands at the center of the drama eventually figures out the &#x27;right&#x27; thing to do. And &#x27;right&#x27; is always another word for &#x27;Christian&#x27;; while the show avoids explicit discussions of Jesus and/or faith, Protestant guilt is readily employed as a plot device.&quot; On top of this, implausible scenarios are seen to be regularly included, such as the daughter Mary&#x27;s absence from the show for several seasons being scarcely explained with the character being busy, wayward or in New York.

According to Frey, &quot;the sappiness and sanctimony of the characters often made the moral lessons impossible to swallow&quot;. Also, the show is claimed to show an obsession with premarital sex. In this regard, the parents (and eldest son Matt) sometimes depict a sense of ownership over the sexuality of Lucy and/or Mary by threatening potential romantic interests, or negotiating their daughters&#x27;/sisters&#x27; romantic rights.

=== U.S. ratings ===
&quot;7th Heaven&quot; was one of the first major hits for the WB and would go on to become most watched TV series ever on the network. While the first season had modest success with around 3 million viewers, the later seasons often averaged 5 to 7 million viewers. It holds the record for the WB&#x27;s most watched hour at 12.5 million viewers, on February 8, 1999; 19 of the WB&#x27;s 20 most watched hours were from &quot;7th Heaven&quot;. On May 8, 2006, it was watched by 7.56 million viewers, the highest rating for the WB since January 2005. When the show moved to the CW, ratings dropped. Possible reasons for the decline include an aired &quot;Countdown to Goodbye&quot; ad campaign for the last six months of the 2005–06 season, which promoted it as the final season ever; though the CW announced the series&#x27; unexpected renewal, it didn&#x27;t promote the new season strongly via billboards, bus stops, magazine or on-air promos. Lastly, the network moved &quot;7th Heaven&quot; from its long-established Monday night slot to Sunday nights, causing ratings to drop further. The series had a season average of just 3.3 million on the new network, losing 36% of the previous year&#x27;s audience. It was the third most watched scripted show on the CW. Overall, it was the seventh most watched show.

==Availability==

===Syndication===
CBS Media Ventures handles the domestic and international distribution of the series. Season one episodes were retitled 7th Heaven Beginnings. Although the series did not receive a rating other than TV-G throughout its 11-season run, reruns on some cable/satellite channels have been given either a TV-PG or TV-14 rating (depending on the subject matter).

In the United States, the show began airing reruns in off-network syndication on September 25, 2000, but ceased to air in syndication in September 2002, while the series was still in first-run broadcast on The WB and later on The CW. The show then aired on the ABC Family channel from the fall of 2002 until 2008. Then, it was announced on April 1, 2010, that ABC Family had re-obtained the rights to the series, and would begin airing it at 11 a.m. (ET/PT) on weekdays beginning April 12, 2010. However, after one week, ABC Family abruptly pulled the show and replaced it with a third daily airing of &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;.

, GMC (now known as UP) is the first network to air &quot;7th Heaven&quot; in the United States since 2010 and began airing the series with a marathon on July 7, 2012. Due to allegations of child molestation against Stephen Collins, the network pulled the series from its schedule as of the afternoon of October 7, 2014. &quot;7th Heaven&quot; briefly returned to UP in December 2014; however, it was quickly removed from the schedule. UP CEO Charley Humbard stated, &quot;We brought the show back because many viewers expressed they could separate allegations against one actor from the fictional series itself. As it turns out, they cannot.&quot; However, in the summer of 2015, UP brought back the series, where from then until 2019 it aired weekdays from 12:00PM to 3:00 PM. It was again pulled from UP&#x27;s schedule afterwards. Previously, it aired on GetTV and Hallmark Drama.

In Ireland the show was aired on Radio Telefis Eireann (RTE). In the UK the show was aired on Sky One as part of their midweek prime time slot.

===Home media===
CBS DVD (distributed by Paramount Home Entertainment) has released &quot;7th Heaven&quot; on DVD. They have released all 11 seasons in Region 1. In region 2, seasons 1-7 have been released while in region 4 the first 6 seasons have been released on DVD.

On August 22, 2017, it was announced that the complete series would be released on DVD for November 14.

<text>Supertramp were an English rock band formed in London in 1970. Marked by the individual songwriting of founders Roger Hodgson (vocals, keyboards and guitars) and Rick Davies (vocals and keyboards), the group were distinguished for blending progressive rock and pop styles. The classic lineup, which lasted ten years from 1973 to 1983, consisted of Davies, Hodgson, Dougie Thomson (bass), Bob Siebenberg (drums) and John Helliwell (saxophone), after which the group&#x27;s lineup changed numerous times, with Davies eventually becoming the only constant member throughout its history.

The group found no success with their first two albums, but after a lineup change into what became their classic lineup, their third album, &quot;Crime of the Century&quot; (1974), was their breakthrough. Initially a more experimental prog-rock group, they began moving towards a more pop-oriented sound with the album. The band reached their commercial peak with 1979&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast in America&quot;, which yielded the international top 10 singles &quot;The Logical Song&quot;, &quot;Breakfast in America&quot;, &quot;Goodbye Stranger&quot; and &quot;Take the Long Way Home&quot;. Their other top 40 hits included &quot;Dreamer&quot; (1974), &quot;Give a Little Bit&quot; (1977) and &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Again&quot; (1982).

In 1982 the band released &quot;...Famous Last Words...&quot;, the last album to feature Hodgson, who left the group in 1983 to pursue a solo career. The band continued with Davies as the sole leader and released two albums until 1988, after which they disbanded and periodically reformed in various configurations, touring with two further albums, &quot;Some Things Never Change&quot; (1997) and &quot;Slow Motion&quot; (2002) resulting from these.

They attained significant popularity in North America, Europe, South Africa and Australia. Their highest sales levels were in Canada, where they had two diamond-certified (ten-times platinum) albums (&quot;Crime of the Century&quot; and &quot;Breakfast in America&quot;), and their only number 1 singles anywhere (&quot;The Logical Song&quot; and &quot;Dreamer&quot;). As of 2007, Supertramp album sales exceeded 60 million.

==History==
===1969–1972: Formation, &quot;Supertramp&quot; and &quot;Indelibly Stamped&quot;===
In 1969 Stanley &quot;Sam&quot; August Miesegaes, a Dutch millionaire, ceased providing financial support to a band called The Joint, as he was disappointed with them. He offered Swindon-born keyboardist Rick Davies, a former bandmate of Irish singer-songwriter Gilbert O&#x27;Sullivan, whose talent he felt had been &quot;bogged down&quot; by the group, an opportunity to form his own band with Miesegaes&#x27;s financial backing. The band included Roger Hodgson (bass and vocals), Richard Palmer (guitars and vocals) and Keith Baker (percussion).

Davies and Hodgson had radically different backgrounds and musical inspirations. Davies was working class and fiercely devoted to blues and jazz, while Hodgson had gone straight from English private school to the music business and was fond of pop. Despite this, they hit it off during the auditions and began writing virtually all of their songs together, with Palmer as a third writer in the mix. Hodgson and Davies collaborated on the songwriting while Palmer composed the lyrics.

The group, having dubbed themselves &quot;Daddy&quot;, after several months of rehearsal at a country house in West Hythe, Kent, flew to Munich for a series of concerts at the P. N. Club. One 10-minute performance there of &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; was filmed by Haro Senft (&quot;Daddy Portrait 1970&quot;). The rehearsals had been less than productive and their initial repertoire consisted of only four songs, two of which were covers.

In January 1970 Keith Baker left, replaced by former stage actor Robert Millar (b. 2 February 1950 – d. 22 July 2024), and to avoid confusion with &quot;Daddy Longlegs&quot;, at Palmer&#x27;s suggestion, the band changed its name to &quot;Supertramp&quot;, a moniker inspired by &quot;The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp&quot; by William Henry Davies.

In April 1970 Supertramp, while back in Munich, returned the favour to their friend Haro Senft by contributing music to his next film, &quot;&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Fegefeuer&quot;), and would also agree to have tracks from their first album used in a documentary, &quot;Extremes&quot; (1971), by Tony Klinger and Michael Lytton.

Supertramp were one of the first groups to be signed to the UK branch of A&amp;M Records and their first album, &quot;Supertramp&quot;, was released on 14 August 1970 in the UK and Canada (it would not be issued in the US until late 1977). Stylistically, the album was fairly typical of progressive rock of the era. Despite receiving a good deal of critical praise, the album did not attract a large audience.

Dave Winthrop (flute and saxophone, vocals) had first auditioned for the group in March 1970 but did not join until July, just before the release of the first record. He performed with Supertramp at the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival on 27 August 1970. The membership continued to change in the six months following the album&#x27;s release. Palmer left the band in December 1970, followed by Millar in January 1971, who had suffered a nervous breakdown. Palmer, as Richard Palmer-James, went on to work as a lyricist for King Crimson. Palmer was replaced by former The Nice guitarist David O&#x27;List, who lasted for only one gig. A drummer from Birmingham, Dickie Thomas, was brought in during the interim until auditions brought the band Kevin Currie in February 1971.

For the next album, &quot;Indelibly Stamped&quot;, released in June 1971 in both the UK and US, Frank Farrell (bass, keyboards, backing vocals) joined, while Hodgson switched to guitar and Davies served as a second lead singer. With Palmer&#x27;s departure, Hodgson and Davies wrote and composed separately for this and the band&#x27;s subsequent albums. The record sold even less than their debut. In the aftermath, all members gradually quit except Hodgson and Davies, and Miesegaes withdrew his financial support in October 1972.

===1973–1978: &quot;Crime of the Century&quot; and commercial breakthrough===
After Farrell&#x27;s departure in the spring of 1972, 20-year-old bassist Nick South (from Alexis Korner&#x27;s band) came in for a temporary stint until Dougie Thomson (from The Alan Bown Set) joined in July. In the summer of 1973 more auditions to replace the departed Curry and Winthrop started and introduced Bob Siebenberg, initially credited as Bob C. Benberg, and another Alan Bown alumnus, John Helliwell adding saxophone, other woodwinds, occasional keyboards, synthesizers, backing vocals, completing the lineup in the summer of 1973. Hodgson would also begin introducing compositions featuring keyboards, particularly the Wurlitzer electric piano, in the band in addition to guitar. This lineup of Supertramp would remain in place for the next ten years.

Meanwhile, the bond between Davies and Hodgson had begun weakening. Hodgson mused, &quot;There&#x27;s a very deep bond, but it&#x27;s definitely mostly on a musical level. When there&#x27;s just the two of us playing together, there&#x27;s an incredible empathy. His down-to-earth way of writing, which is very rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, balances out my lighter, melodic style.&quot; Over Supertramp&#x27;s history, their relationship would be amicable but increasingly distant as their lifestyles and musical inclinations drifted apart. Their songwriting partnership gradually dissolved. Although all of Supertramp&#x27;s songs would continue to be officially credited as &quot;written by Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson&quot;, most of them were written individually.

Supertramp needed a hit record to continue working and finally got one with &quot;Crime of the Century&quot;. Released in September 1974, it began the group&#x27;s run of critical and commercial successes, hitting number 4 in Britain, number 38 in the US and number 4 in Canada. This album made the top 100 albums in Canada three years in a row in 1974, 1975 and 1976, even though it did not have a Top 40 hit in Canada. &quot;Dreamer&quot;, the 1975 UK Top 20 single written by Hodgson, was the band&#x27;s first hit single and drove the album to the top of the charts. Another single from the record, &quot;Bloody Well Right&quot;, hit the US Top 40 in May 1975 and would be their only hit in the country for more than two years.

With a hit album under their belt, pressures on the band increased and the follow-up &quot;Crisis? What Crisis?&quot; had to be recorded in the few months between two scheduled concert tours. As a consequence, most of the material consisted of leftover songs from &quot;Crime of the Century&quot;. Decades later the band would continue to regard the album as one of their worst moments. Nevertheless, Hodgson said in a 2015 interview that &quot;Crisis? What Crisis?&quot; was his favourite Supertramp album. Despite Supertramp&#x27;s own misgivings, the album was well received by critics. When released in November 1975, it broke both the UK Top Twenty and the US Top Fifty in spite of its singles all being commercial flops.

The following album, &quot;Even in the Quietest Moments...&quot;, released in April 1977, spawned a hit single with &quot;Give a Little Bit&quot; (number 15 US, number 29 UK, number 8 in Canada), first written by Hodgson at 19 or 20 years of age before he introduced it to the band for recording five to six years later. As usual, the popularity of the album itself eclipsed that of its singles and &quot;Even in the Quietest Moments...&quot; hit number 16 in the US, number 12 in the UK and number 1 in Canada. During this period, the band permanently relocated to Los Angeles.

===1979–1983: &quot;Breakfast in America&quot;, &quot;...Famous Last Words...&quot; and Hodgson&#x27;s departure===
The band&#x27;s switch to a more pop-oriented approach peaked with their most popular album, &quot;Breakfast in America&quot;. For the last two months of completing the album, Hodgson parked a camper outside of the studio to work diligently on mixing, with brief periods of rest in between. He remembered feeling that &quot;it could be a big album&quot; and that he spent &quot;days and sometimes weeks choosing the right songs and the right order of songs so one song flowed into the next&quot;.

Released in March 1979, &quot;Breakfast in America&quot; reached number 3 in the UK and number 1 in the US and Canada. The album spawned four successful singles (more than their first five albums combined): three of Hodgson&#x27;s songs, &quot;The Logical Song&quot; (number 1 Canada, number 6 US, number 7 UK), &quot;Take the Long Way Home&quot; (number 4 Canada, number 10 US, not released in UK) and &quot;Breakfast in America&quot; (number 9 UK, not released in the US or Canada) and Davies&#x27; &quot;Goodbye Stranger&quot; (number 5 in Canada, number 15 US, number 57 UK).

To avoid an overly lengthy gap between albums during their hiatus, the band put out 1980&#x27;s &quot;Paris&quot;, a two-LP live album recorded mostly at the Pavillon de Paris. It broke the top ten in both the US and UK. A live version of &quot;Dreamer&quot; was released as a single hitting number 1 in Canada and number 15 in the US, even though the studio version had failed to even chart there in 1974. And a second single from the live album, &quot;Breakfast in America&quot;, peaked at number 62 in the US.

Hodgson moved his family from the Los Angeles area to the mountains of northern California where he built a home and studio and focused on his family and spiritual life, while recording a solo album, initially titled &quot;Sleeping with the Enemy&quot;, which would later be released as &quot;In the Eye of the Storm&quot; in 1984. This geographic separation widened the rift between him and the rest of the group; during the conceptualization and recording of their next album, &quot;...Famous Last Words...&quot;, Davies and Hodgson found far greater difficulty in reconciling their musical ideas than they had before, and it was apparent to the rest of the band that Hodgson wanted out.

&quot;...Famous Last Words...&quot; was released in October 1982 and scored two more hits with &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Again&quot; and &quot;My Kind of Lady&quot;. It peaked at no. 5 in the USA and no. 6 in the UK.

A worldwide tour followed in 1983, in which the band was joined by two additional musicians on stage, former Alice Cooper and Queen player Fred Mandel (guitar, keyboards, synthesizers, backing vocals) and Scott Page (sax, guitar, horns, backing vocals), and Hodgson announced he would not be continuing with the band once the tour finished in September 1983. Hodgson has stated that his departure was motivated by a desire to spend more time with his family and make solo recordings and that there were never any real personal or professional problems between him and Davies, as some people thought.

===1984–1988: &quot;Brother Where You Bound&quot; and &quot;Free as a Bird&quot;===

The Davies-led Supertramp released &quot;Brother Where You Bound&quot; in May 1985. The album was a deliberate step away from the pop approach of their last two studio albums, and reached no. 20 in the UK charts and no. 21 in the US charts. It included the Top 30 hit single &quot;Cannonball&quot;, along with the title track, a 16-minute exposition on Cold War themes highlighted by guitar solos from Pink Floyd&#x27;s David Gilmour. A 20-minute film of the title track by Rene Daalder was used to promote the album.

Supertramp mounted a tour in the fall of 1985 through early 1986 that was their first without Hodgson. The lineup included Davies, Thomson, Helliwell, Siebenberg, Scott Page, Marty Walsh (guitar, backing vocals), Carl Verheyen (guitar, percussion, backing vocals) and Mark Hart (vocals, guitar, keyboards). Brad Cole sat in for Hart for several gigs in late October/early November 1985 after the latter was called away due to a family emergency.

1987&#x27;s &quot;Free as a Bird&quot; experimented in heavily synthesised music, such as &quot;I&#x27;m Beggin&#x27; You&quot;, which reached number 1 on the US dance charts. The stylistic change was generally not well-received, however, and the album itself reached only no. 93 in the UK and 101 in the US, breaking a streak of seven consecutive top 100 efforts on the American charts.

In addition to their shift towards less commercially oriented material, the band members decided to drop all of Hodgson&#x27;s compositions from their setlist in order to further establish an identity separate from him. However, audiences were angered by the omissions of these songs, and although Supertramp toured in 1985 using only Davies&#x27;s compositions, in 1988 the pressure from fans and their first tour of South America drove them to reintroduce a handful of Hodgson-penned hits to their set. The band&#x27;s 1988 touring lineup was almost the same as it had been in &#x27;85/&#x27;86, but with Brad Cole returning in place of Scott Page and percussionist Steve Reid instead of guitarist Carl Verheyen.

After 1988&#x27;s tour, the group fragmented. Davies later explained, &quot;We&#x27;d been out there for about 20 years just recording and touring and it seemed time to have a break with no ideas as to if or when we would come back. We decided not to actually say anything, just sort of fade away like an old soldier.&quot;

===1993 Hodgson and Davies reunion===
On 14 April 1993 at the Beverly Hills Hilton, for a special dinner honoring Jerry Moss, co-founder of A&amp;M Records, Hodgson, Davies and Helliwell (together with Jeff Daniel) appeared to perform &quot;The Logical Song&quot; and &quot;Goodbye Stranger&quot;. After that, Davies and Hodgson began working together again, recording demos of two new songs, &quot;You Win, I Lose&quot; and &quot;And the Light&quot;. But disagreements over management prompted them to part ways once again soon after, with both songs eventually appearing, &quot;sans&quot; Hodgson, on Supertramp&#x27;s next release in 1997.

===1996–2002: &quot;Some Things Never Change&quot; and &quot;Slow Motion&quot;===
In 1996 Davies re-formed Supertramp with Helliwell, Siebenberg and guitarist/keyboardist/vocalist Mark Hart, who was new to the official lineup but had prominently contributed to &quot;Free as a Bird&quot; and to the group&#x27;s tours from 1985 to 1988. Their 1985–86 guitarist, Carl Verheyen, returned as well, along with new bassist Cliff Hugo, horn player Lee Thornburg and former America percussionist Tom Walsh (who was replaced for the band&#x27;s 1997 tour by Bob Siebenberg&#x27;s son Jesse, who would also go on to contribute guitar, keyboards and vocals), bringing the band up to an eight-man lineup. The result of this reunion was &quot;Some Things Never Change&quot;, a new studio album released in March 1997 that echoed the earlier Supertramp sound and reached number 74 in the UK.

In the summer of 1997, Supertramp returned to the road, resulting in the live &quot;It Was the Best of Times&quot; (April 1999).

After a three-year hiatus, Supertramp released in April 2002 a new studio album entitled &quot;Slow Motion&quot;, followed by a 2002 world tour entitled &quot;One More for the Road Tour&quot;.

Supertramp continued to play several Hodgson-penned songs during live shows following their reunion. Hodgson subsequently claimed that when he had left the band back in 1983, he and Davies made a verbal agreement that they would not play those songs. Davies has never publicly alluded to such an agreement, and former member Dougie Thomson (who retired from performing to move into music publishing) commented &quot;Nobody except Rick and Roger were privy to that conversation. Rick and Roger had several dialogues that no one else was privy to. Again, that&#x27;s hearsay.&quot; The publishing company and contract legally recognize which songs each songwriter actually wrote. Hodgson has contractual approval rights over the use of his songs and Davies for his.

===2000s–present: Hiatuses and touring===
After the 2002 &quot;One More for the Road Tour&quot;, Supertramp went inactive once again. Another attempt to bring Hodgson back into the band failed in 2005. In 2008, it was announced that Supertramp&#x27;s music would be featured in the film adaptation of Irvine Welsh&#x27;s best-selling novel &quot;&quot;.

In 2009, Hodgson said he could not see a Supertramp reunion ever happening: &quot;We&#x27;ve looked at it and talked it over... I would never say never but Rick [Davies] has pretty much retired right now and I&#x27;m in the prime of my life. The reaction I am getting from fans is &#x27;please don&#x27;t reunite&#x27;.&quot;

On 21 April 2010, it was announced that Supertramp would perform 35 concerts in late 2010 in Europe. Hodgson concurrently embarked on a worldwide solo tour, and thus was unable to rejoin the band for the 70–10 tour. However, in response to a fan campaign, Hodgson sent a letter to Rick Davies and had his manager send one to Davies&#x27;s management, offering to join them for select dates during gaps in his tour schedule. Davies&#x27;s agent notified Hodgson that his offer was declined.

When asked whether Hodgson might appear at any Supertramp concerts, Davies replied, &quot;I know there are some fans out there who would like that to happen. There was a time when I had hoped for that too. But the recent past makes that impossible. In order to play a great show for our fans, you need harmony, both musically and personally. Unfortunately that doesn&#x27;t exist between us anymore and I would rather not destroy memories of more harmonious times between all of us.&quot; Hodgson and Supertramp continued to tour separately in 2011.

The group&#x27;s lineup for their 2010–11 tours was Davies, Helliwell, Siebenberg, Jesse Siebenberg (now assuming Mark Hart&#x27;s role on vocals, keyboards and guitar), Cliff Hugo, Carl Verheyen, Lee Thornburg, Gabe Dixon (vocals, keyboards, percussion) and Cassie Miller (backing vocals).

Supertramp played what turned out to be its last concert on 15 November 2012 in Madrid, during a private event at the IFEMA fairgrounds, which coincidentally a few years before had used &#x27;From Now On&#x27; in its advertising commercials. The show, that was held in front of several thousand people, lasted about eighty minutes and the set list was a shortened version of the one used on the &#x27;70–10&#x27; tour. The band was also the same as that of the 2010–11 tour, except for John Helliwell, who was unable to get there due to another professional commitment with Egbert Derix on that same date. Saxophonist Rob Hardt, an American musician who was a friend of Lee Thornburg and used to work with Latin American salsa percussionist and singer Poncho Sánchez, stood in for Helliwell.

From 2012 to 2015, Supertramp went dormant again. Meanwhile, Hodgson toured his &quot;Breakfast in America World Tour&quot; from 2012 onwards. On 25 January 2015 at Cirque Royal in Brussels, Belgium, Hodgson continued his &quot;Breakfast in America World Tour&quot; with a European leg concluding 7 September 2015 at Tempodrom in Berlin, Germany and the North American leg of the tour extending from November in Tarrytown, New York, concluding on 13 December in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

In 2015, Supertramp announced their first tour in more than four years: a 25-date European tour entitled &quot;Supertramp Forever&quot; set to launch on 3 November 2015 in Porto, Portugal. The tour would include a London show on 7 December at The O2 Arena and would end on 11 December 2015 at the Ziggo Dome in Amsterdam, Netherlands. On 4 August 2015, however, the band announced that the tour was cancelled due to health issues affecting Rick Davies, who had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma and required aggressive treatment to combat the disease.

In late August 2018, Davies gave an interview in which he expressed that, for the most part, he has overcome his health problems and enjoys playing music again, something he could not do in 2016, when he was under medical treatment. Davies can also be seen performing a few tracks in a rehearsal/sound check at a bar with some of Supertramp&#x27;s current members at his side. He also stated that Supertramp were unlikely to return as a structured band.

In 2018 Hodgson stopped paying Thomson, Helliwell and Siebenberg royalties from Supertramp songs. In 2021 the three sued Hodgson and Davies, for not paying them royalties. Davies settled out of court in 2023. Hodgson won the case in court in 2024.

<text>The Notacanthiformes are an order of deep-sea ray-finned fishes, consisting of the families Halosauridae and Notacanthidae (spiny eels).

&quot;Fishes of the World&quot; (2006) lists it as the suborder Notacanthoidei of Albuliformes. The notacanthiforms are much more eel-like than the albuliforms; for instance, the caudal fin has disappeared.

Fish of the order are found in oceans worldwide, at depths from . They are elongated fish, although not as much so as the true eels, and have various feeding strategies, like hyperbenthic and detritus feeders, epifaunal browsers, and megafaunal croppers. They typically feed on slow-moving or sessile animals, such as molluscs, echinoderms, and sea anemones. Like the true eels, they have a leptocephalus larva that floats in the surface waters before transforming into an adult. Unusually, the larva can often be larger than the adult.

==Families==
Notacanthiformes has the following two families clasified within it:
* Halosauridae (Halosaurs)
* Notacanthidae (Deep-sea spiny-eels)

<doc id="324091" wikidata="Q544394" url="?curid=324091" title="Sedition">
<text>Sedition is overt conduct, such as speech or organization, that tends toward rebellion against the established order. Sedition often includes subversion of a constitution and incitement of discontent toward, or insurrection against, established authority. Sedition may include any commotion, though not aimed at direct and open violence against the laws. Seditious words in writing are seditious libel. A seditionist is one who engages in or promotes the interest of sedition.

Because sedition is overt, it is typically not considered a subversive act, and the overt acts that may be prosecutable under sedition laws vary by jurisdiction.

==Roman origin==
In the later Roman Republic, () referred to the offence of collective disobedience toward a magistrate, which included both military mutiny and civilian mob action. Leading or instigating was punishable by death. Civil became frequent during the political crisis of the first century BCE, as populist politicians sought to check the privileged classes by appealing to public assemblies. The Julio-Claudian emperors addressed this situation by abolishing elections and other duties of the assemblies. Under Tiberius the crime of was subsumed in the law of &quot;majestas&quot;, which prohibited any utterance against the dignity of the emperor.

&quot;Seditio&quot; has often been proposed as the offence for which Jesus was crucified, as described in : &quot;inciting the people to rebellion&quot; (, &quot;leading the people astray&quot;).

==History in common law jurisdictions==
The term &quot;sedition&quot; in its modern meaning first appeared in the Elizabethan Era (c. 1590) as the &quot;notion of inciting by words or writings disaffection towards the state or constituted authority&quot;. The law developed in the Court of Star Chamber, relying on longstanding &quot;&quot; statutes and a broad repressive act of Mary I against literature that contained &quot;the encouraging, stirring or moving of any insurrection&quot;. That seditious statements were true was no defence, but rather an aggravating factor, since true statements were all the more potent. After the Star Chamber&#x27;s dissolution, enforcement continued in the courts of assize and quarter sessions.

Three classes of seditious offence were commonly charged: &quot;seditious words&quot; manifested by speaking, &quot;seditious libel&quot; by writing or publishing, and &quot;seditious conspiracy&quot; by active plotting. Although England adopted the name of the offence from Roman-derived civil law, it did not rely on the jurisprudence.

===Australia===

Australia&#x27;s sedition laws were amended in anti-terrorism legislation passed on 6 December 2005, updating definitions and increasing penalties.

In late 2006, the Commonwealth Government, under the Prime-Ministership of John Howard proposed plans to amend Australia&#x27;s Crimes Act 1914, introducing laws that meant artists and writers may be jailed for up to seven years if their work was considered seditious or inspired sedition either deliberately or accidentally. Opponents of these laws have suggested that they could be used against dissent that may be seen as legitimate.

In 2006, the then Australian Attorney-General Philip Ruddock had rejected calls by two reports—from a Senate committee and the Australian Law Reform Commission—to limit the sedition provisions in the Anti-Terrorism Act 2005 by requiring proof of intention to cause disaffection or violence. He had also brushed aside recommendations to curtail new clauses outlawing &quot;urging conduct&quot; that &quot;assists&quot; an &quot;organization or country engaged in armed hostilities&quot; against the Australian military.

These laws were amended in Australia on 19 September 2011. The &#x27;sedition&#x27; clauses were repealed and replaced with &#x27;urging violence&#x27;.

===Canada===
In Canada, sedition, which includes speaking seditious words, publishing a seditious libel, and being party to a seditious conspiracy, is an indictable offense, for which the maximum punishment is of fourteen years&#x27; imprisonment. For military personnel, Section 82 of the National Defence Act cites Seditious Offences as advocating governmental change by force, punishable by imprisonment for life or to less. Service offences up to two years imprisonment are served in a Military prison, followed by transfer to a penitentiary for the remainder of the sentence.

During World War II, Camillien Houde campaigned against conscription. On 2 August 1940, Houde publicly urged the men of Quebec to ignore the national registration measure introduced by the federal government. Three days later, he was placed under arrest by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on charges of sedition, and then confined without trial in internment camps in Petawawa, Ontario and Ripples, New Brunswick until 1944. Upon his release on 18 August 1944, he was greeted by a cheering crowd of 50,000 Montrealers, and won back his job as Montreal mayor in 1944&#x27;s civic election.

===Hong Kong===

A Sedition Ordinance had existed in the territory since 1970, which was subsequently consolidated into the Crimes Ordinance in 1972. According to the Crimes Ordinance, a seditious intention is an intention to bring into hatred or contempt or to excite disaffection against the person of government, to excite inhabitants of Hong Kong to attempt to procure the alteration, otherwise than by lawful means, of any other matter in Hong Kong as by law established, to bring into hatred or contempt or to excite disaffection against the administration of justice in Hong Kong, to raise discontent or disaffection amongst inhabitants of Hong Kong, to promote feelings of ill-will and enmity between different classes of the population of Hong Kong, to incite persons to violence, or to counsel disobedience to law or to any lawful order. Sedition is punishable by a fine of HK$5,000 and imprisonment for 2 years, and further offences are punishable by imprisonment for 3 years.

Article 23 of the Basic Law requires the special administrative region to enact laws prohibiting any act that be said of treason, secession, sedition, subversion against the Central People&#x27;s Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The National Security (Legislative Provisions) Bill was tabled in early 2003 to replace the existing laws regarding treason and sedition, and to introduce new laws to prohibit secessionist and subversive acts and theft of state secrets, and to prohibit political organizations from establishing overseas ties. The bill was shelved following massive opposition from the public.

The National Security Law, enacted on 30 June 2020, contains articles prohibiting secession and subversion against the Central Government and the Government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Both charges may carry penalty up to life imprisonment. Notably, Hong Kong&#x27;s National Security Law was drafted by the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress, and passed by the National People&#x27;s Congress, as part of the Annex III the Basic Law. This law was written in Mainland China&#x27;s civil law as opposed to Hong Kong&#x27;s common law traditions.

===India===

In 2003, the Vishva Hindu Parishald (VHP) general secretary, Praveen Togadia, was sought to be charged with sedition for allegedly waging a war against the elected government and taking part in anti-national activity.

In 2010, writer Arundhati Roy was sought to be charged with sedition for her comments on Kashmir and Maoists. Two individuals have been charged with sedition since 2007. Binayak Sen, an Indian doctor and public health specialist, and activist was found guilty of sedition. He is national Vice-President of the People&#x27;s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL). On 24 December 2010, the Additional Sessions and District Court Judge B.P Varma Raipur found Binayak Sen, Naxal ideologue Narayan Sanyal and Kolkata businessman Piyush Guha, guilty of sedition for helping the Maoists in their fight against the state. They were sentenced to life imprisonment, but he got bail in Supreme Court on 16 April 2011.

On 10 September 2012, Aseem Trivedi, a political cartoonist, was sent to judicial custody till 24 September 2012 on charges of sedition over a series of cartoons against corruption. Trivedi was accused of uploading &quot;ugly and obscene&quot; content to his website, also accused of insulting the Constitution during an anti-corruption protest in Mumbai in 2011. Trivedi&#x27;s arrest under sedition has been heavily criticised in India. The Press Council of India termed it a &quot;stupid&quot; move.

In February 2016, JNU student union president Kanhaiya Kumar was arrested on charges of Sedition &amp; raising voice for the &quot;Tukde Tukde Gang&quot; under section 124-A of Indian Penal Code (which was part of the sedition laws implemented by the British Rule). His arrest raised political turmoil in the country with academicians and activists marching and protesting against this move by the government. He was released on interim bail on 2 March 2016 for a lack of conclusive evidence. On 13 January 2019, The Delhi Police filed a chargesheet on Monday against former Jawaharlal Nehru University Students&#x27; Union (JNUSU) president Kanhaiya Kumar and others in a sedition case lodged in 2016.

On 17 August 2016, Amnesty International India was booked in a case of &quot;sedition&quot; and &quot;promoting enmity&quot; by Bengaluru police. A complaint was filed by ABVP, an all India student organization affiliated to the Hindu Nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.

In September 2018, Divya Spandana, the Congress Social Media chief was booked for sedition for calling Narendra Modi, the prime minister of India, a thief.

On 10 January 2019, a sedition case was registered suo-motto against Hiren Gohain and two others for their remarks against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill. Gohain called the move &quot;a desperate attempt by a cornered government&quot;.

On February 13, 2020, a sedition case was registered against Disha Ravi a climate activist, by the Delhi Police for allegedly trying to incite perpetuate violence and defame India with regards to her support of the farmers protest.

A sedition case was filed against Shashi Tharoor, journalist Rajdeep Sardesai and 5 other journalists by Noida Police for allegedly instigating violence and spreading misinformation over a series of tweets during the violence from a tractor rally on republic day on 26 January in New Delhi.

As of May 2022, Supreme Court of India has put sedition law on hold and ordered the government to not book further cases under the same.

Sedition as defined under Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code has been replaced by Section 147 of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita

===Ireland===
Article 40.6.1° (i) of the 1937 Constitution of Ireland guaranteed the right to freedom of expression, subject to several constraints, among them:

Advocates for freedom of speech have argued that this constraint ought to be removed; any constitutional amendment requires a referendum. The thirty-seventh amendment of the constitution removed the offence of blasphemy.

The law of the Republic of Ireland since the 1922 independence of the Irish Free State inherited earlier common law principles based on English law. The crime of seditious libel was presumed to persist, although last prosecuted in 1901. After the common law offence of blasphemous libel was ruled in 1999 to be incompatible with the constitution&#x27;s guarantee of freedom of speech, jurists argued that seditious libel was similarly unconstitutional. Both blasphemous libel and seditious libel were abolished by the Defamation Act 2009, which also created new crime of &quot;publication or utterance of blasphemous matter&quot; to fulfil the constitutional requirement with regard to blasphemy. No new offence was created for sedition in 2009; this was in line with the recommendations of a 1991 consultation paper on libel by the Law Reform Commission (LRC) on the basis that several statutes define offences which are tantamount to sedition.

The Offences against the State Act 1939 created the offences of making, distributing, and possessing a &quot;seditious document&quot;. The LRC suggests that &quot;sedition&quot;, left undefined by the constitution, might be implicitly defined by the 1939 act&#x27;s definition of a &quot;seditious document&quot; as one:
# consisting of or containing matter calculated or tending to undermine the public order or the authority of the State, or
# which alleges, implies, or suggests or is calculated to suggest that the government functioning under the Constitution is not the lawful government of the State or that there is in existence in the State any body or organization not functioning under the Constitution which is entitled to be recognised as being the government of the country, or
# which alleges, implies, or suggests or is calculated to suggest that the military forces maintained under the Constitution are not the lawful military forces of the State, or that there is in existence in the State a body or organization not established and maintained by virtue of the Constitution which is entitled to be recognised as a military force, or
# in which words, abbreviations, or symbols referable to a military body are used in referring to an unlawful organization
These provisions were largely aimed at Irish republican legitimatists who believed the 1922 Free State was a usurpation of the Irish Republic proclaimed in 1916 and again in 1919. The fourth provision made the use of the names &quot;Irish Republican Army&quot; and &quot;Óglaigh na hÉireann&quot; seditious as they were regarded as rightfully used by the Irish Defense Forces. The LRC notes that advocating violence is not essential for a document to be seditious.

The LRC also notes that Section 1A of the Broadcasting Authority Act 1960 (inserted in 1976) prohibited broadcasting of &quot;anything which may reasonably be regarded as being likely to promote, or incite to, crime or as tending to undermine the authority of the State&quot;. The 1960 act has since been replaced by the Broadcasting Act 2009, section 39 of which obliges broadcaster not to broadcast &quot;anything which may reasonably be regarded as causing harm or offense, or as being likely to promote, or incite to, crime or as tending to undermine the authority of the State&quot;.

===Malaysia===
=== Mauritius ===
The sedition law is based on Article 283 of the Criminal Code which was enacted in 1838. 

===New Zealand===
Sedition charges were not uncommon in New Zealand early in the 20th century. For instance, the future Prime Minister Peter Fraser had been convicted of sedition in his youth for arguing against conscription during World War I, and was imprisoned for a year. Perhaps ironically, Fraser re-introduced the conscription of troops as the Prime Minister during World War II.

In New Zealand&#x27;s first sedition trial in decades, Tim Selwyn was convicted of sedition (section 83 of the Crimes Act 1961) on 8 June 2006.
Shortly after, in September 2006, the New Zealand Police laid a sedition charge against a Rotorua youth, who was also charged with threatening to kill. The police withdrew the sedition charge when the youth agreed to plead guilty on the other charge.

In March 2007, Mark Paul Deason, the manager of a tavern near the University of Otago, was charged with seditious intent although he was later granted diversion when he pleaded guilty to publishing a document which encourages public disorder. Deason ran a promotion for his tavern that offered one litre of beer for one litre of petrol where at the end of the promotion, the prize would have been a couch soaked in the petrol. It is presumed the intent was for the couch to be burned—a popular university student prank. Police also applied for Deason&#x27;s liquor license to be revoked.

Following a recommendation from the New Zealand Law Commission, the New Zealand government announced on 7 May 2007 that the sedition law would be repealed. The Crimes (Repeal of Seditious Offences) Amendment Act 2007 was passed on 24 October 2007, and entered into force on 1 January 2008.

Russell Campbell made a documentary regarding conscientious objectors in New Zealand called &quot;Sedition.&quot;

===Singapore===
===United Kingdom===
Sedition was a common law offence in the UK. James Fitzjames Stephen&#x27;s &quot;Digest of the Criminal Law&quot; stated that:
Stephen in his &quot;History of the Criminal Law of England&quot; accepted the view that a seditious libel was nothing short of a direct incitement to disorder and violence. He stated that the modern view of the law was plainly and fully set out by Littledale J. in &quot;Collins&quot;. In that case the jury were instructed that they could convict of seditious libel only if they were satisfied that the defendant &quot;meant that the people should make use of physical force as their own resource to obtain justice, and meant to excite the people to take the power in to their own hands, and meant to excite them to tumult and disorder&quot;.

The last prosecution for sedition in the United Kingdom was in 1972, when three people were charged with seditious conspiracy and uttering seditious words for attempting to recruit people to travel to Northern Ireland to fight in support of Republicans. The seditious conspiracy charge was dropped, but the men received suspended sentences for uttering seditious words and for offences against the Public Order Act 1936.

In 1977, a Law Commission working paper recommended that the common law offence of sedition in England and Wales be abolished. They said that they thought that this offence was redundant and that it was not necessary to have any offence of sedition. However this proposal was not implemented until 2009, when sedition and seditious libel (as common law offences) were abolished in England and Wales and in Northern Ireland by section 73 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, with effect from 12 January 2010.

In Scotland, section 51 of the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010 abolished the common law offences of sedition and leasing-making with effect from 28 March 2011.

Sedition by an alien is still an offence under section 3 of the Aliens Restriction (Amendment) Act 1919, punishable by up to three months of imprisonment if convicted summarily, or up to ten years of imprisonment if convicted on indictment.

===United States===
====Civilian====
The charge of seditious libel for true statements was weakened, but not abolished, in the 1735 New York case of &quot;Crown v. John Peter Zenger&quot;. Zenger had published attacks on Governor William Cosby that were well received in the province. The Attorney General charged him by criminal information, bypassing the grand jury process, and Zenger was acquitted by a trial jury.

President John Adams signed into law the Sedition Act of 1798, which set out punishments of up to two years of imprisonment for &quot;opposing or resisting any law of the United States&quot; or writing or publishing &quot;false, scandalous, and malicious writing&quot; about the President or the U.S. Congress (though not the office of the Vice-President, then occupied by Adams&#x27; political opponent Thomas Jefferson). This Act of Congress was allowed to expire in 1801 after Jefferson&#x27;s election to the Presidency; Jefferson pardoned those still serving sentences, and fines were repaid by the government. This law was never appealed to the United States Supreme Court (which had not yet established its power to invalidate laws passed by Congress granted in Marbury v. Madison) but opponents claimed it was unconstitutional under the First Amendment.

In the Espionage Act of 1917, Section 3 made it a federal crime, punishable by up to 20 years of imprisonment and a fine of up to $10,000, to willfully spread false news of the United States Army or Navy with an intent to disrupt its operations, to foment mutiny in their ranks, or to obstruct recruiting. This Act of Congress was amended by the Sedition Act of 1918, which expanded the scope of the Espionage Act to any statement criticizing the Government of the United States. These laws were upheld by the Supreme Court in the 1919 decisions &quot;Schenck v. United States&quot; (concerning distribution of flyers urging men to resist the draft) and &quot;Abrams v. United States&quot; (concerning leaflets urging cessation of weapons production). Schenck led to the &quot;shouting &#x27;fire&#x27; in a crowded theater&quot; explanation of the limits of free speech. The laws were largely repealed in 1921, leaving laws forbidding foreign espionage in the United States and allowing military censorship of sensitive material.

In 1940, the Alien Registration Act, or &quot;Smith Act&quot;, was passed, which made it a federal crime to advocate or to teach the desirability of overthrowing the United States Government, or to be a member of any organization which does the same. It was often used against communist party organizations. This Act was invoked in three major cases, one of which against the Socialist Worker&#x27;s Party in Minneapolis in 1941, resulting in 23 convictions, and again in what became known as the Great Sedition Trial of 1944 in which a number of pro-Nazi figures were indicted but released when the prosecution ended in a mistrial. Also, a series of trials of 140 leaders of the Communist Party USA also relied upon the terms of the &quot;Smith Act&quot;—beginning in 1949—and lasting until 1957. Although the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the convictions of 11 CPUSA leaders in 1951 in &quot;Dennis v. United States&quot;, that same Court reversed itself in 1957 in the case of &quot;Yates v. United States&quot;, by ruling that teaching an ideal, no matter how harmful it may seem, does not equal advocating or planning its implementation. Although unused since at least 1961, the &quot;Smith Act&quot; remains a federal law.

There was, however, a brief attempt to use the sedition laws, as defined by the Sedition Act of 1918 amendments to the Espionage Act of 1917, after socialist leagues in America distributed leaflets calling for resisting the draft. Those amendments were deemed incompatible with freedom of speech under American law, in spite of the exceptional circumstances that led to those laws, against protesters of the Vietnam War. On 17 October 1967, two demonstrators, while engaged in a sit-in at the Army Induction Center in Oakland, California, were arrested and charged with sedition by a deputy U.S. Marshal. U.S. Attorney Cecil Poole changed the charge to trespassing. Poole said, &quot;three guys reaching up and touching the leg of an inductee, and that&#x27;s conspiracy to commit sedition? That&#x27;s ridiculous!&quot; The marshals were in the process of stepping on the demonstrators as they attempted to enter the building, and the demonstrators were trying to protect themselves from the marshals&#x27; feet. Attorney Poole later added, &quot;We&#x27;ll decide what to prosecute, not marshals.&quot; This decision drew the ire of California Senator George Murphy, who would later block Poole&#x27;s confirmation to a federal judgeship in response.

In 1981, Oscar López Rivera, a Puerto Rican nationalist and Vietnam War veteran, was convicted and sentenced to 70 years in prison for seditious conspiracy (among other offenses) for his involvement in FALN - a Puerto Rican independence group that carried out over 130 bombings in the United States. Rivera was tried for being a recruiter and bomb-making trainer. In 1999, he was among the 16 Puerto Rican nationalists offered conditional clemency by U.S. President Bill Clinton in 1999, but he rejected the offer. Then-Congressman, now Governor of Puerto Rico Pedro Pierluisi stated that &quot;the primary reason that López Rivera did not accept the clemency offer extended to him in 1999 was because it had not also been extended to certain fellow Puerto Rico independence movement prisoners, including Mr. (Carlos Alberto) Torres&quot;. Torres was released from prison in July 2010. In January 2017, President Barack Obama commuted López Rivera&#x27;s sentence; he was released May 2017, having served 36 years in prison.

In 1987, fourteen white supremacists were indicted by a federal grand jury for seditious conspiracy between July 1983 and March 1985. Some alleged conspirators were serving time for overt acts, such as the crimes committed by The Order - bank robbery and the assassination of Alan Berg. Others, such as Louis Beam and Richard Butler, were charged for their speech seen as spurring on the overt acts by the others. In April 1988, a federal jury in Arkansas acquitted all the accused of charges of seditious conspiracy. Some still had to serve lengthy prison sentences on other charges, albeit one of the witnesses at the trial, Frazier Glenn Miller Jr., would later kill three people in shootings at Jewish community centers in 2014.

On 1 October 1995, Omar Abdel-Rahman and nine others were convicted of seditious conspiracy after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.

Laura Berg, a nurse at a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs hospital in New Mexico, was investigated for sedition in September 2005 after writing a letter to the editor of a local newspaper, accusing several national leaders of criminal negligence. Though their action was later deemed unwarranted by the director of Veteran Affairs, local human resources personnel took it upon themselves to request an FBI investigation. Ms. Berg was represented by the ACLU. Charges were dropped in 2006.

On 28 March 2010, nine members of the Hutaree Christian Patriot militia were arrested and charged with crimes including seditious conspiracy. In August 2012, U.S. District Judge Victoria Roberts dismissed all serious charges against the remaining defendants, including sedition, and rebuked prosecutors for bringing the case. One man, Jacob Ward, was found not competent to stand trial. Three of the men, Joshua John Clough, David Brian Stone Sr., the leader of the group, and his son Joshua Stone, pleaded guilty to weapons charges.

On 13 January 2022, eleven members or associates of the militia group Oath Keepers, including founder Stewart Rhodes, were charged with seditious conspiracy for their involvement with the January 6 United States Capitol attack. In 2022, three of the charged Oath Keepers pled guilty to the crime, becoming the first convictions since 1995. On 29 November 2022, Rhodes, after pleading not guilty in January 2022, was convicted of seditious conspiracy, becoming the first person convicted by a jury of the crime in 27 years. On 23 January 2023, four additional Oath Keepers were found guilty.

On 6 June, 2022, five members or associates of the militia group Proud Boys, including the former chairman, Enrique Tarrio, were indicted for seditious conspiracy for their involvement in the January 6 United States Capitol attack.

====Military====
Sedition is a punishable offense under Article 94 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

==Civil law jurisdictions==

===Germany===
 (&quot;incitement of the people&quot;) is a legal concept in Germany and some Nordic countries. It is sometimes loosely translated as sedition, although the law bans the incitement of hatred against a segment of the population such as a particular race or religion.

===Spain===
After the 2017–18 Spanish constitutional crisis some of the leaders of the Catalan independence movement were charged with several criminal offences, notably rebellion and sedition. An offence similar to the Spanish offence of rebellion did not exist in Germany and the European Arrest Warrant against Carles Puigdemont was withdrawn, allowing him to remain in Belgium. Other leaders who were convicted of sedition received 9–13 years in prison as established in the Spanish Penal Code by a unanimous sentence of the Spanish Supreme Court during the October 2019 trial.. 

In 2022, it was removed from the Spanish Criminal Code, being replaced with the new lesser-sentence &quot;aggravated public disorder&quot; offense.

<text>Philip Henry Niekro ( ; April 1, 1939 – December 26, 2020), nicknamed &quot;Knucksie&quot;, was an American baseball pitcher who played 24 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Milwaukee/Atlanta Braves, Cleveland Indians, New York Yankees and Toronto Blue Jays. Niekro is generally regarded as the greatest knuckleball pitcher of all time.

During his career, Niekro was selected to five All-Star teams, led the National League in victories twice (in 1974 and 1979), led the major leagues in earned run average once (in 1967), and won the National League Gold Glove Award five times. As of 2024, Niekro ranks 16th on MLB&#x27;s all-time wins list with 318 career victories; as of 2024, he is the only knuckleballer to win 300 or more major league games. Niekro and his younger brother Joe amassed 539 wins between them; as of 2013, the Niekros had the most combined wins by brothers in baseball history. As of 2023, Niekro also holds the major league record with 121 career victories after the age of 40.

Niekro was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1997.

==Early life==
Niekro was born in Blaine, Ohio, and grew up in Lansing, Ohio, the son of Henrietta (Klinkoski) and Philip Niekro. He was of Polish descent. He attended Bridgeport High School in Bridgeport, Ohio, and was a boyhood friend of Basketball Hall-of-Famer John Havlicek. The baseball field where he played at Bridgeport High School&#x27;s Perkins Field athletic complex was renamed &quot;The Niekro Diamond&quot; in 2008 after Phil and his brother, fellow major league pitcher Joe Niekro. The brothers were the sons of a coal miner who had pitched semi-pro baseball and learned to throw a knuckleball from another coal miner. He taught the boys the pitch in the backyard. In addition, Phil played American Legion Baseball.

Niekro signed with the Milwaukee Braves in 1959 for $250 (). He pitched for several minor league teams at several levels for the next few years, appearing mostly as a relief pitcher. While he was briefly promoted to the Class AAA Louisville Colonels in 1960, he spent the rest of that season pitching for the Jacksonville Braves. He spent the next season with the Class AA Austin Senators. He returned to Louisville in 1962 and had a 9–6 record. He missed the 1963 season due to military service.

==Major league career==

=== Milwaukee / Atlanta Braves (1964–1983) ===
==== 1964–1969 ====
Niekro debuted with the Milwaukee Braves in 1964, working 15 major league innings and spending time with the team&#x27;s class AAA minor league affiliate. He stayed with the major league team all year in 1965, pitching innings in 41 games and recording six saves. In 1966, Niekro split time again between the Braves and their minor league system, going 4–3 with a 4.11 earned run average (ERA).

Niekro led the league with a 1.87 ERA in 1967, earning an 11–9 record with 10 complete games and 9 saves. He began the year as a relief pitcher but had earned a job in the starting rotation during the season.

Before the 1968 season, sportswriter Fred Down described the Braves&#x27; pitching staff as &quot;chaotic&quot; and reported that team leadership was planning to use Niekro as both a starter and a reliever in the coming season. He appeared in 37 games, finishing with a 14–12 record and 15 complete games. He appeared in relief three times, earning two saves.

In 1969, his first All-Star season, he had a 23–13 season with a 2.56 ERA, finishing second in the National League Cy Young award balloting to Tom Seaver. The Braves went to the playoffs, where Niekro was 0–1 with four earned runs allowed in an eight-inning appearance against the New York Mets. Niekro&#x27;s playoff loss came against Seaver. The team was eliminated from the playoffs after losing the next two games.

==== 1970–1979 ====
In 1970, he went 12–18 with a 4.27 ERA in what turned out to be a down year. He surrendered a league-leading 40 home runs that year, a feat he would not repeat until 1979.

From 1971 to 1973, he combined for a record of 44–36. The Braves finished 3rd, 4th, and 5th in their division. On August 5, 1973, Niekro threw a no-hitter against the San Diego Padres, the first for the Braves since moving to Atlanta.

In 1974, Niekro led the league in several pitching categories, including wins (20), complete games (18), and innings pitched (302.1). He finished third in the voting for the Cy Young Award that year.

From 1975 to 1976, he went 15–15 and 17–11 and made a second All-Star appearance in 1975.

Between 1977 and 1979, Niekro was the league leader in complete games, innings pitched and batters faced. In 1979, the 40-year-old Niekro led the league in both wins (21) and losses (20). He finished sixth in Cy Young Award voting in both 1978 and 1979, and made his third All-Star appearance in 1978, as well as winning three consecutive Gold Glove Awards from 1978 to 1980.

Phil and Joe Niekro were NL co-leaders in wins in 1979; the two brothers each earned 21 wins that year. As of 2013, he remains the last MLB pitcher to win and lose 20 games in the same season. The 1979 season was Niekro&#x27;s third and final 20-win season and his second and final 20-loss season.

==== 1980–1983 ====
In 1980 and 1981, he went 15–18 and 7–7 while leading the league in games started (38) and losses (18) in 1980.

In 1982, at the age of 43, Niekro led the Braves with a 17–4 season while winning his fourth Gold Glove Award and appearing in his fourth All-Star game. On October 1, with the Braves clinging to a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers, Niekro beat the San Diego Padres almost single-handedly by throwing a complete game shutout and hitting a two-run home run. Niekro started Game One of the subsequent 1982 National League Championship Series against the St. Louis Cardinals and pitched well, but the game was called on account of rain just before it became official. He pitched six innings of Game 2 and left with a 3–2 lead. However, the Cardinals scored two late runs after Niekro left the game and would eventually sweep the series.

In 1983, he went 11–10 and won his fifth Gold Glove Award. After the season, the Braves released him.

=== New York Yankees (1984–1985) ===
In 1984, Niekro signed a two-year contract with the New York Yankees. He won 16 games in 1984 and made his fifth and final All-Star appearance.

On October 6, 1985, Niekro earned his 300th career win with a shutout win over the Toronto Blue Jays. At 46 years, 188 days, Niekro became the oldest pitcher to pitch a shutout in the major leagues. This record stood for nearly 25 years before Jamie Moyer (47 years, 170 days) bested the feat in May 2010. He did not throw his trademark knuckleball throughout the game until the final hitter; to former AL MVP Jeff Burroughs. Niekro struck Burroughs out to end the game. He finished the 1985 season with a 16–12 record, the final time he won 15 or more games in a single season. He was released by the Yankees before the 1986 season started.

=== Cleveland Indians (1986–1987) ===
After two seasons in New York, Niekro pitched for the Cleveland Indians in 1986. He went 11–11 with a 4.32 ERA. He started the 1987 season with the Indians, going 7–11 in 26 starts.

=== Toronto Blue Jays (1987) ===
On August 9, 1987, Niekro was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays for Darryl Landrum and a player to be named later, who was later revealed to be Don Gordon. After going 0–2 in three starts, the Blue Jays released Niekro.

=== Second stint with the Atlanta Braves (1987) ===
On September 23, 1987, Niekro signed again with his old team, the Atlanta Braves. On September 27, he made his final start of his career, pitching three innings and surrendering five runs in the no-decision. The Braves lost the game against the San Francisco Giants 15–6. Niekro retired at the end of the season.

At the age of 48, Niekro was the oldest player in major league history to play regularly until Julio Franco played at age 49 in 2007. He set a major league record by playing 24 seasons in the major leagues without a World Series appearance. His total of innings pitched is the most by any pitcher in the post-1920 live-ball era.

=== Pitching repertoire ===

A sidearm pitcher, his pitching featured the knuckleball, which frustrated major league hitters. Ralph Kiner compared Niekro&#x27;s special pitch to &quot;watching Mario Andretti park a car&quot;. Pete Rose said, &quot;I work for three weeks to get my swing down pat and Phil messes it up in one night... Trying to hit that thing is a miserable way to make a living.&quot; Catcher Bob Uecker was also frustrated by the pitch at times, saying, &quot;Niekro struck out a hitter once and I never touched the ball. It hit me in the shinguard, bounced out to Clete Boyer at third base and he threw out the runner at first. Talk about a weird assist: 2–5–3 on a strikeout.&quot; Uecker also said humorously of the pitch, &quot;The way to catch a knuckleball is to wait until it stops rolling and pick it up.&quot;

===Hall of Fame induction===
Niekro was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1997, his fifth year of eligibility. He was the only player elected that year; Tony Pérez and Don Sutton were among the notable eligible players who were not elected that year. After he was notified, Niekro said, &quot;Giving a description of today&#x27;s phone call is impossible. I&#x27;ve been stunned before. I just didn&#x27;t prepare myself this year. I was not going to get myself so high.&quot; The year before, Niekro had received the most Hall of Fame votes out of all the players in the ballot, but had not received the required 75% of the vote for election.

===Career statistics===
== Later endeavors ==

After the end of his professional baseball career, Niekro managed the all-women Colorado Silver Bullets baseball team. Niekro taught his nephew Lance Niekro to throw a knuckleball after Lance&#x27;s unsuccessful stints as a power-hitting first base prospect with the San Francisco Giants.

Niekro was a member of the board of directors for Kiz Toys, a toy company based out of Cumming, Georgia, and Niekro advised the company on the KizSport baseball line, reviewing product designs and development.

The Gwinnett Stripers—the AAA affiliate of the Atlanta Braves—play their home games at Coolray Field. Coolray Field has a restaurant, Niekro&#x27;s, that is named after Niekro. It features the Knucksie Sandwich, made with barbecue pork and cole slaw atop a corn muffin; it was said to be Niekro&#x27;s favorite sandwich. Niekro and his family supported the students of Bridgeport High School with the proceeds from an annual golf tournament called &quot;The Niekro Classic&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Niekro and his wife, Nancy, had three sons: Philip, John, and Michael.

On December 26, 2020, Niekro died in his sleep at age 81. He had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and had battled the disease for some time.

<doc id="324108" wikidata="Q757293" url="?curid=324108" title="Fishes of the World">
<text>Fishes of the World is a standard reference for the systematics of fishes. It was first written in 1976 by the American ichthyologist Joseph S. Nelson (1937–2011). Now in its fifth edition (2016), the work is a comprehensive overview of the diversity and classification of the 30,000-plus fish species known to science.

The book begins with a general overview of ichthyology, although it is not self-contained. After a short section on Chordata and non-fish taxa, the work lists all known fish families in a systematic fashion. Each family is given at least one paragraph, and usually a body outline drawing; large families have subfamilies and tribes described as well. Notable genera and species are mentioned, though the book does generally not deal with the species-level diversity. The complexities of the higher taxa are described succinctly, with many references for difficult points. The book does not contain any color illustrations.

The fourth edition was the first to incorporate the wide use of DNA analysis, revising many earlier classifications.

The first edition appeared in 1976, the second in 1984, the third in 1994 (John Wiley &amp; Sons, ), the fourth in March 2006 (), and the fifth in April 2016 ().

<doc id="324109" wikidata="Q599979" url="?curid=324109" title="Culture of Korea">
<text>The traditional culture of Korea is the shared cultural and historical heritage of Korea before the division of Korea in 1945.

Since the mid-20th century, Korea has been split between the North Korean and South Korean states, resulting in a number of cultural differences that can be observed even today. Before the Joseon period, the practice of Korean shamanism was deeply rooted in Korean culture.

==Clothing==


The traditional dress known as &quot;hanbok&quot; (; alternatively &quot;joseonot;&quot; in North Korea) has been worn since ancient times. The &quot;hanbok&quot; consists of a shirt (&quot;jeogori&quot;) and a skirt (&quot;chima&quot;).

According to social status, Koreans used to dress differently, making clothing an important mark of social rank. Costumes were worn by the ruling class and the royal family. These upper classes also used jewelry to distance themselves from the ordinary people. A traditional item of jewellery for women was a pendant in the shape of certain elements of nature which was made of gemstones, to which a tassel of silk was connected.

For thousands of years, Korean people nearly exclusively wore plain white and undecorated &quot;hanbok&quot;. Color and ornamentation was only worn if required for a uniform, to display social status, or during special occasions. This led to the development of the nickname &quot;white-clothed people&quot; to describe Koreans. This practice possibly began around the Three Kingdoms of Korea period and lasted until just after the Korean War, after which it ended due to poverty. The basic everyday dress was shared by everyone, but distinctions were drawn in official and ceremonial clothes. During the winter people wore cotton-wadded dresses. Fur was also common.

&quot;Hanbok&quot; are classified according to their purposes: everyday dress, ceremonial dress and special dress. Ceremonial dresses are worn on formal occasions, including a child&#x27;s first birthday (doljanchi), a wedding or a funeral. Special dresses are made for purposes such as shamans, officials.

Today the &quot;hanbok&quot; is still worn during formal occasions. The everyday use of the dress, however, has been lost. However, the elderly still dress in hanbok as well as active estates of the remnant of aristocratic families from the Joseon Dynasty, though this may be changing with something of a modern interest in the traditional dress among some of the young.

Traditionally, the hanbok was a wedding dress that dates back to the 14th century. It was a floor-length gown with an empire waist, fitted jacket, and sewn with vibrant or pastel colors. The use of the Hanbok in daily wear has dropped significantly over the last handful of decades.

In recent years, with the rise of attention to K-Pop, (Korean Pop Music), interest in Korean culture has spiked to an all-time high. Many groups, such as BTS, BlackPink, KARD, and many more, have been praised for showing their culture and heritage by wearing Hanbok in music videos, award shows, and other public appearances.

==Cuisine==

Rice is the staple food of Korea. Having been an almost exclusively agricultural country until recently, the essential recipes in Korea are shaped by this experience. The main crops in Korea are rice, barley, and beans, but many supplementary crops are used. Fish and other seafood are also important because Korea is a peninsula.

Fermented recipes were also developed in early times and often characterize traditional Korean food. These include pickled fish and pickled vegetables. This kind of food provides essential proteins and vitamins during the winter.

Kimchi is one of the famous foods of Korea. Kimchi is pickled vegetables which contain vitamins A and C, thiamine, riboflavin, iron, calcium, carotene, etc. There are many types of kimchi including cabbage kimchi, spring onion kimchi, cucumber kimchi, radish kimchi, and sesame kimchi.

Side Dishes or (Banchan) are commonly eaten with meals in Korea. The main dish is almost always served with side dishes. Some commonly eaten side dishes are: Kimchi, Pickled Radish, Soybean Sprouts, Glass Noodles (Japchae), Cucumber Salad, and Seasoned Spinach.

=== Ceremonial, ritual and temple foods ===
A number of dishes have been developed. These can be divided into ceremonial foods and ritual foods. Ceremonial foods are used when a child reaches 100 days, at the first birthday, at a wedding ceremony, and the sixtieth birthday. Ritual foods are used at funerals, at ancestral rites, shaman&#x27;s offerings and as temple food.

A distinguishing characteristic of Temple Food is that it does not use the common five strong-flavoured ingredients of Korean cuisine--(garlic, spring onion, wild rocambole, leek, and ginger), and meat.

For ceremonies and rituals, rice cakes are vital. The colouring of the food and the ingredients of the recipes are matched with a balance of yin and yang.

===Royal court cuisine (&quot;surasang&quot;)===
Today, surasang (traditional court cuisine) is available to the whole population. In the past, vegetable dishes were essential. However, meat consumption has increased. Traditional dishes include &quot;ssambap&quot;, &quot;bulgogi&quot;, &quot;sinseollo&quot;, &quot;kimchi&quot;, &quot;bibimbap&quot;, and &quot;gujeolpan&quot;.

===Tea===
Originally tea was used for ceremonial purposes or as part of traditional herbal medicine. Some of teas made of fruits, leaves, seeds or roots are enjoyed. Five tastes of tea are distinguished in Korea: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and pungent.

==Festivals==

The traditional Korean calendar was based on the lunisolar calendar. Dates are calculated from Korea&#x27;s meridian. Observances and festivals are rooted in Korean culture. The Korean lunar calendar is divided into 24 turning points (절기, ), each lasting about 15 days. The lunar calendar was the timetable for the agrarian society in the past, but is vanishing in the modern Korean lifestyle.

The Gregorian calendar was officially adopted in 1895, but traditional holidays and age reckoning are still based on the old calendar. Older generations still celebrate their birthdays according to the lunar calendar.

The biggest festival in Korea today is Seollal (the traditional Korean New Year). Other important festivals include Daeboreum (the first full moon), Dano (spring festival), and Chuseok (harvest festival).

There are also a number of regional festivals, celebrated according to the lunar calendar.

==Fine arts==
===Ceramics===

In the Goryeo period, jade green celadon ware became more popular. In the 12th century, sophisticated methods of inlaying were invented, allowing more elaborate decorations in different colors. In Arts of Korea, Evelyn McCune states, &quot;During the twelfth century, the production of ceramic ware reached its highest refinement. Several new varieties appeared simultaneously in the quarter of a century, one of which, the inlaid ware must be considered a Korean invention.&quot; William Bowyer Honey of the Victoria and Albert Museum of England after World War II wrote, &quot;The best Corean (Korean) wares were not only original, they are the most gracious and unaffected pottery ever made.

White porcelain became popular in the 15th century and soon overtook celadon ware. White porcelain was commonly painted or decorated with copper.

During the Imjin wars in the 16th century, Korean potters were brought back to Japan where they heavily influenced Japanese ceramics.
Many Japanese pottery families today can trace their art and ancestry to these Korean potters whom the Japanese captured during its attempted conquests of the Korean peninsula.

In the late Joseon period (late 17th century) blue-and-white porcelain became popular. Designs were painted in cobalt blue on white porcelain.

===Crafts===
There is a unique set of handicrafts produced in Korea. Most of the handicrafts are created for particular everyday use, often giving priority to practical use rather than aesthetics. Traditionally, metal, wood, fabric, lacquerware, and earthenware were the main materials used, but later glass, leather or paper have sporadically been used.

Many sophisticated and elaborate handicrafts have been excavated, including gilt crowns, patterned pottery, pots or ornaments. During the Goryeo period the use of bronze was advanced. Brass, that is copper with one third zinc, has been a particularly popular material. The dynasty, however, is most prominently renowned for its use of celadon ware.

During the Joseon period, popular handicrafts were made of porcelain and decorated with blue painting. Woodcraft was also advanced during that period. This led to more sophisticated pieces of furniture, including wardrobes, chests, tables or drawers. It is part of a craft that goes back well over a millennium, keeping alive a tradition that remains unchanged from at least the seventeenth century. It is this tradition that has made Korean furniture one of the most sought-after styles of exotic furniture by antique dealers and collectors worldwide. Immediately recognizable as Korean, this unique art was only &quot;discovered&quot; by the West in the late 1940s and 1950s.


===Dance and martial arts===

In Korea, there is a distinction between court dance and folk dance. Common court dances are &quot;jeongjaemu&quot; () performed at banquets, and &quot;ilmu&quot; (), performed at Korean Confucian rituals.&quot;Jeongjaemu&quot; is divided into native dances (향악정재, &quot;hyangak jeongjae&quot;) and forms imported from Central Asia and China (당악정재, &quot;dangak jeongjae&quot;). &quot;Ilmu&quot; are divided into civil dance (문무, &quot;munmu&quot;) and military dance (무무, &quot;mumu&quot;). Many mask dramas and mask dances are performed in many regional areas of Korea. The traditional clothing is the , it is a special kind of dress that women wear on festivals. It is pink with multiple symbols around the neck area.

Traditional choreography of court dances is reflected in many contemporary productions, and the strong dance tradition in the country carries on to this day, with many dance groups forming over the last few decades.

&quot;Taekkyon&quot;, a traditional Korean martial art, is central to the classic Korean dance. &quot;Taekkyon&quot;, being a complete system of integrated movement, found its core techniques adaptable to mask, dance and other traditional artforms of Korea. &quot;Taekwondo&quot;, a Korean martial art, began in the 1940s in Korea.

===Painting===
The earliest paintings found on the Korean peninsula are petroglyphs of prehistoric times. With the arrival of Buddhism from India via China, different techniques were introduced. These techniques quickly established themselves as the mainstream techniques, but indigenous techniques still survived. Among them were the Goguryeo tomb murals. These murals inside many of the tombs are an invaluable insight into the ceremonies, warfare, architecture, and daily life of ancient Goguryeo people. Balhae kingdom, a successor state of Goguryeo, absorbed much of traditional Goguryeo elements.

There is a tendency towards naturalism with subjects such as realistic landscapes, flowers and birds being particularly popular. Ink is the most common material used, and it is painted on mulberry paper or silk. Humorous details are sometimes present.

In the 18th century, indigenous techniques were advanced, particularly in calligraphy and seal engraving.

During the Joseon period, new genres of Korean painting flourished, such as &quot;chaekgeori&quot; (paintings of books) and &quot;munjado&quot; (paintings of letters), revealing the infatuation with books and learning in Korean culture.

Arts are both influenced by tradition and realism. For example, Han&#x27;s near-photographic &quot;Break Time at the Ironworks&quot; shows muscular men dripping with sweat and drinking water from tin cups at a sweltering foundry. Jeong Son&#x27;s &quot;Peak Chonnyo of Mount Kumgang&quot; is a classical Korean landscape of towering cliffs shrouded by mists.

===Music===
There is a genre distinction between folk music and court music. Korean folk music is varied and complex in different ways, but all forms of folk music maintain a set of rhythms (called 장단; Jangdan) and a loosely defined set of melodic modes. Korean folk music is Pansori () performed by one singer and one drummer. Occasionally, there might be dancers and narrators. They have been designated an intangible cultural property in UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of the world, and Pungmul () performed by drumming, dancing and singing. Samul Nori is a type of Korean traditional music based on Pungmul, and Sanjo () that is played without a pause in faster tempos. Nongak () means &quot;farmers&#x27; music&quot;.

Korean court music can be traced to the beginning of the Joseon Dynasty in 1392. Korean court musics include A-ak, Dang-ak and Hyang-ak. The traditional Korean music is still played and sung a lot.

==Gardens==

The principles of temple gardens and private gardens are the same. Korean gardening in East Asia is influenced by primarily Korean Shamanism and Korean folk religion.

The lotus pond is an important feature in the Korean garden. If there is a natural stream, often a pavilion is built next to it, allowing the pleasure of watching the water. Terraced flower beds are a common feature in traditional Korean gardens.

The Poseokjeong site near Gyeongju was built in the Silla period. It highlights the importance of water in traditional Korean gardens. The garden of Poseokjeong features an abalone-shaped watercourse. During the last days of the Silla kingdom, the king&#x27;s guests would sit along the watercourse and chat while wine cups were floated during banquets.

==Houses==

Korean traditional houses are called Hanok (). Sites of residence are traditionally selected using traditional geomancy. While the geomancy had been a vital part of Korean culture and Korean Shamanism since prehistoric times, geomancy was later re-introduced by China during the Three Kingdoms period of Korea&#x27;s history.

A house is built against a hill and face south to receive as much sunlight as possible. This orientation is still preferred in modern Korea. Geomancy also influences the shape of the building, the direction it faces, and the material the house is constructed with.

Traditional Korean houses can be structured into an inner wing (안채, &quot;anchae&quot;) and an outer wing (사랑채, &quot;sarangchae&quot;). The individual layout largely depends on the region and the wealth of the family. Whereas aristocrats used the outer wing for receptions, poorer people kept cattle in the &quot;sarangchae&quot;. The wealthier a family, the larger the house. However, it was forbidden to any family except for the king to have a residence of more than 99 &quot;kan&quot;. A &quot;kan&quot; is the distance between two pillars used in traditional houses.

The inner wing normally consisted of a living room, a kitchen, and a wooden-floored central hall. More rooms may be attached to this. Poorer farmers would not have any outer wings. Floor heating (온돌, &quot;ondol&quot;) has been used in Korea since prehistoric times. The main building materials are wood, clay, tile, stone, and thatch. Because wood and clay were the most common materials used in the past not many old buildings have survived into present times.

==Religious beliefs==
Korean shamanism, or &quot;musok&quot; (), is one of the oldest religions in Korea, and still survives to this day. Practitioners of Korean shamanism are usually female, though male shamans do exist as well. Korean shamans of either gender can be called &quot;mudang&quot; or &quot;mansin&quot;, while &quot;paksu&quot; is a term only for a male shaman. The two main ways one becomes a shaman are either hereditarily, or by suffering through &quot;mubyŏng&quot; (&quot;spirit possession sickness&quot;). The main role of the &quot;mudang&quot; is to perform rituals, or &quot;kut&quot;, to achieve various means, including healing, divination, and spirit pacification. Simultaneously a religious affair and a visual and auditory spectacle, &quot;kut&quot; are full of bright colors, elaborate costumes, altars piled high with ritual food and alcohol, various forms of singing and dancing accompanied by traditional instruments, and props including fans, bells, and knives. While the most well-known rituals are characterized by spirit possession, for most hereditary shamans, as well as in some regional variations, the shaman&#x27;s role is to honor the spirits and deities rather than be possessed by them.

Despite the social stigma surrounding the performance of a &quot;kut&quot; even today, there are still many clients who are willing, though potentially ashamed, to pay immense sums to enlist the help of a &quot;mansin&quot; when in need.

Throughout South Korea&#x27;s political turmoil in the 20th century, &quot;musok&quot; stayed strong against systemic persecution. Indeed, several festivals and &quot;kut&quot; have been preserved as intangible cultural heritage under the 1962 Cultural Heritage Protection Act, and the esteemed &quot;mudang&quot; Kim Keum-hwa was designated as a Living National Treasure in 1985. In the 1970s and 80&#x27;s, Korean shamanism was used as a form of protest against the government by the pro-democracy Popular Culture Movement. Whether willing to participate in political dissidence or not, under the movement&#x27;s &quot;minjung&quot; (&quot;the people&quot;) ideology, long-oppressed shamans were painted as the bearers of Korean culture who could also use their spirit-possession &quot;kut&quot; to give voice to those who had died for social justice causes.

In recent times, Korean shamanism is evolving, with its growing popularity in media today, and the adaptability of its practitioners in a modernized world. &quot;Mudang&quot; have more control over their public image, now using documentaries and television along with personal websites to advertise and present their own stories. 

Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism were later introduced to Korea through cultural exchanges with Chinese dynasties. Buddhism was the official religion of the Goryeo dynasty, and many privileges were given to Buddhist monks during this period. However, the Joseon period saw the suppression of Buddhism, where Buddhist monks and temples were banned from the cities and confined to the countryside. In its place a strict form of Confucianism, which some see as even more strict than what had ever been adopted by the Chinese, became the official philosophy. Korean Confucianism was epitomized by the seonbi class, scholars who passed up positions of wealth and power to lead lives of study and integrity.

Throughout Korean history and culture, regardless of separation, the traditional beliefs of Korean Shamanism, Mahayana Buddhism and Confucianism have remained an underlying influence of the religion of the Korean people as well as a vital aspect of their culture. In fact, all these traditions coexisted peacefully for hundreds of years. They still exist in the more Christian South and in the North, despite pressure from its government.

===Influence of Buddhism on culture and traditions===
Korean culture is deeply influenced by the Buddhism as Buddhism has become inherent aspect of the Korea culture, including the secular Korean traditions followed by the non-Buddhist Koreans. A 2005 government survey indicated that about a quarter of South Koreans identified as Buddhist. However, the actual number of Buddhists in South Korea is ambiguous as there is no exact or exclusive criterion by which Buddhists can be identified, unlike the Christian population. With Buddhism&#x27;s incorporation into traditional Korean culture, it is now considered a philosophy and cultural background rather than a formal religion. As a result, many people outside of the practicing population are deeply influenced by these traditions. Thus, when counting secular believers or those influenced by the faith while not following other religions, the number of Buddhists in South Korea is considered to be much larger. Similarly, in officially atheist North Korea, while Buddhists officially account for 4.5% of the population, a much larger number (over 70%) of the population are influenced by Buddhist philosophies and customs.

When Buddhism was originally introduced to Korea from Former Qin [the 4th century state in Northern China] in 372, about 800 years after the death of the historical Gautama Buddha [founder of Buddhism], shamanism [a religious practice] was the indigenous religion. The Samguk yusa and Samguk sagi record the following 3 monks who were among the first to bring Buddhist teaching, or Dharma, to Korea in the 4th century during the Three Kingdoms period: Malananta – an Indian Buddhist monk who came from Serindian area of southern China&#x27;s Eastern Jin Dynasty and brought Buddhism to the King Baekje of Baekje in the southern Korean peninsula in 384 CE, Sundo – a monk from northern Chinese state Former Qin brought Buddhism to Goguryeo in northern Korea in 372 CE, and Ado – a monk who brought Buddhism to Silla in central Korea. As Buddhism was not seen to conflict with the rites of nature worship, it was allowed by adherents of Shamanism to be blended into their religion. Thus, the mountains that were believed by shamanists to be the residence of spirits in pre-Buddhist times later became the sites of Buddhist temples.

Though it initially enjoyed wide acceptance, even being supported as the state ideology during the Goryeo (918–1392 CE) period, Buddhism in Korea suffered extreme repression during the Joseon (1392–1897 CE) era, which lasted over five hundred years. During this period, Neo-Confucianism overcame the prior dominance of Buddhism. Only after Buddhist monks helped repel the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98) did the persecution of Buddhists stop. Buddhism in Korea remained subdued until the end of the Joseon period when its position was strengthened somewhat by the colonial period, which lasted from 1910 to 1945. However, these Buddhist monks did not only put an end to Japanese rule in 1945, but they also asserted their specific and separate religious identity by reforming their traditions and practices. They laid the foundation for many Buddhist societies, and the younger generation of monks came up with the ideology of &quot;Mingung Pulgyo&quot;, or &quot;Buddhism for the people.&quot; The importance of this ideology is that it was coined by the monks who focused on common men&#x27;s daily issues.
==Modern cultures==
===Culture of South Korea===
The contemporary culture of South Korea developed from the traditional culture of Korea which was prevalent in the early Korean nomadic tribes. By maintaining thousands of years of ancient Korean culture, South Korea has split on its own path of cultural development away from North Korean culture since the division of Korea in 1949. The industrialization, urbanization, and westernization of South Korea, especially Seoul, have brought many changes to the way Koreans live. Changing Economy of South Korea and lifestyles have led to a concentration of population in major cities and depopulation of the rural countryside, with multi-generational households separating into nuclear family living. Today, many Korean cultural elements, especially popular culture, have spread across the globe and have become some of the most prominent cultural forces in the world.

===Culture of North Korea===

In North Korea, a central theme of cultural expression is to take the best from the past and discard capitalist elements. Popular, vernacular styles and themes in the arts such as literature, art, music and dance are esteemed as expressing the truly unique spirit of the Korean nation.

Ethnographers, [i.e. people who do qualitative research that involves immersing yourself in a particular community or organisation to observe their behavior and interactions up close], devote much energy to restoring and reintroducing cultural forms that have the proper proletarian, or folk, spirit and that encourage the development of collective consciousness.

Proletarian refers to the Marxism study of the classes in terms of Capitalism including the Proletarians and Bourgeoisie. Other classes including landlords, petty bourgeoisie, peasants, and lumpenproletariat also exist but are not primary in terms of the dynamics of capitalism.

Last but not least, lively, optimistic musical and choreographic expressions are stressed when it comes to dance. Group folk dances and choral singing are traditionally practiced in some but not all parts of Korea. They were being promoted throughout North Korea in the early 1990s among schools and university students. Farmers&#x27; music bands have also been revived.

===Culture of Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture===
Both Mandarin Chinese and Korean are used as official languages in Yanbian. &quot;Vice News&quot; described the prefecture as both &quot;West Korea&quot; and &quot;The Third Korea&quot; due to the prominence of both North and South Korean culture.

The Museum of Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture was planned in 1960, and constructed in 1982. It contains over 10,000 exhibits, including 11 first-level artifacts. The exhibits&#x27; labels and explanations are in 2 languages, which is in Korean and Chinese. Guided tours are also available in both of these languages.

== High-Context Culture in South Korea ==

In Korea, high-context culture is prominent in the society as it is a very important part of their culture. High-context culture are a continuum of how explicit the messages exchanged in a culture are and how important the context in communication. High-context cultures often exhibit less-direct verbal and nonverbal communication, utilizing small communication gestures and reading more meaning into these less-direct messages.

=== Social Relations and Communication ===
In contrast to American communications where it&#x27;s considered more low-context cultured and background information is needed, Korea&#x27;s communication relies on cultural context derived from their customs and etiquettes. It&#x27;s inevitable that differences in cultural perspectives will be channeled through communication; and if this communication is to be productive, interactions based on cultural knowledge and mutual respect will be needed. Asian languages, such as Korean, reflect its high-context culture with an abundance of implicitness.

Indirect communication is most likely to appeal to Korean citizens because they tend to value Confucianism which emphasizes harmony and egalitarianism. It reflected in their deeply rooted Confucian values and ideology which includes all participants in communication to save face if possible. If a stand is not taken, then people would not have to stick out among others, which is a form for threat in Confucian Korean cultures. Many of these high-culture context forms take place in the language itself such as their formality when using Korean honorifics, customs, and etiquette.

=== Customs and Etiquette in Korea ===

Although most aspects of etiquette are accepted by the country at large, customs can be localized to specific regions or influenced by other cultures, namely China, Japan, and the United States. Customs in Korea are derived from religions such as Korean Confucianism which is highly evident in the way that Koreans take care of others and their traditions. Most Koreans observe some forms of Confucian ceremonies such as Korean birthday celebrations and Korean New Year traditions, such as &quot;Seollal&quot;, even if they don&#x27;t know of its Confucian value.

Furthermore, Korean etiquette, or the code of social behavior that governs human interactions, focuses on the core values of Korean Confucianism due to South Korea being an advocate of strict Confucian hierarchy and moral leadership. This determines how Korean citizens are expected to behave and uphold their responsibilities in their daily lives. Such important etiquette include avoiding making eye contact since it is considered it bad manners to look straight into another person&#x27;s eyes while conversing. Thus, Koreans fix their gaze between the eyes and will often glance downwards. Failure to &#x27;look somebody&#x27; in the eye does not mean &#x27;a sign of weakness&#x27;. Instead, it will provide them with respect back from the person whether they are an elder, superior, or a stranger because it shows that a person is willing to give them the respect they deserve and not act inappropriately by &quot;glaring&quot; at them.

==World Heritage Sites==

There are a number of designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Korea.

===Jongmyo Shrine===
The Jongmyo Shrine was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Site list in 1995 and is located in Seoul. The shrine is dedicated to the spirits of the ancestors of the royal family of the Joseon Dynasty. It is heavily influenced by Korean Confucian tradition. An elaborate performance of ancient court music (with accompanying dance) known as &quot;Jongmyo jeryeak&quot; is performed there each year.

When it was built in 1394 it was to be one of the longest buildings in Asia. There are 19 memorial tablets of kings and 30 of their queens, placed in 19 chambers. The shrine was burnt to the ground during the Imjin wars, but rebuilt in 1608.

===Changdeokgung===
Changdeokgung is also known as the &quot;palace of illustrious virtue&quot;. It was built in 1405, burnt to the ground during the Imjin wars in 1592 and reconstructed in 1609. For more than 300 years Changdeokgung was the site of the royal seat. It is located in Seoul.

The surroundings and the palace itself are well matched. Some of the trees behind the palace are now over 300 years old, besides a preserved tree which is over 1000 years old. Changdeokgung was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1997.

===Bulguksa===


Bulguksa is also known as the temple of the &quot;Buddha Land&quot; and home of the &quot;Seokguram Grotto&quot;. The temple was constructed in 751 and consists of a great number of halls. There are two pagodas placed in the temple.

The &quot;Seokguram&quot; grotto is a hermitage of the Bulguksa temple. It is a granite sanctuary. In the main chamber a Buddha statue is seated. The temple and the grotto were added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1995.

===Tripitaka Koreana and Haeinsa===

Haeinsa is a large temple in South Gyeongsang Province. It was originally built in 802 and home to the &quot;Tripitaka Koreana&quot; wood blocks, the oldest Buddhist wooden manuscripts in the world. The carving of these wood blocks was initiated in 1236 and completed in 1251. The wood blocks are testimony to the pious devotion of king and his people.

The word &quot;Tripitaka&quot; is Sanskrit and stands for three baskets, referring to the Buddhist laws of aesthetics. The &quot;Tripitaka Koreana&quot; consists of 81&#x27;258 wood blocks and is the largest, oldest, and most complete collection of Buddhist scripts. Amazingly there is no trace of errata or omission on any of the wood blocks. The &quot;Tripitaka Koreana&quot; is widely considered as the most beautiful and accurate Buddhist canon carved in Hanja.

The site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1995.

===Hwaseong===

Hwaseong is the fortification of Suwon, South Korea. Its construction was completed in 1796 and it features all the latest features of Korean fortification known at the time. The fortress also contains a magnificent palace used for the King&#x27;s visit to his father&#x27;s tomb near the city.

The fortress covers both flat land and hilly terrain, something rarely seen in East Asia. The walls are 5.52 kilometres long and there are 41 extant facilities along the perimeter. These include four cardinal gates, a floodgate, four secret gates and a beacon tower.

Hwaseong was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1997.

===Namhansanseong===

Namhansanseong became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2014.

=== Sansa, Buddhist Mountain Monasteries ===
The Sansa are Buddhist mountain monasteries located throughout the southern provinces of the Korean Peninsula. The spatial arrangement of the seven temples that comprise the property, established from the 7th to 9th centuries, present common characteristics that are specific to Korea – the &#x27;madang&#x27; (open courtyard) flanked by four buildings (Buddha Hall, pavilion, lecture hall and dormitory). They contain a large number of individually remarkable structures, objects, documents and shrines. These mountain monasteries are sacred places, which have survived as living centres of faith and daily religious practice to the present.

===Historic Monuments and Sites in Kaesong===
The Historic Monuments and Sites in Kaesong became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2013.

===Gochang, Hwasun and Ganghwa sites===
The sites of &quot;Gochang&quot;, &quot;Hwasun&quot; and &quot;Ganghwa&quot; were added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage in 2000. These sites are home to prehistoric graveyards which contain hundreds of different megaliths. These megaliths are gravestones which were created in the 1st century B.C. out of large blocks of rock. Megaliths can be found around the globe, but nowhere in such a concentration as in the sites of Gochang, Hwasun and Ganghwa.

===Gyeongju Area===
The historic area around Gyeongju was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage in 2000. Gyeongju was the capital of the Silla kingdom. The tombs of the Silla rulers can still be found in the centre of the city. These tombs took the shape of rock chambers buried in an earthen hill, sometimes likened with the pyramids. The area around Gyeongju, in particular on the Namsan mountain, is scattered with hundreds of remains from the Silla period. Poseokjeong is one of the most famous of these sites, but there is a great number of Korean Buddhist art, sculptures, reliefs, pagodas and remains of temples and palaces mostly built in the 7th and 10th century.

===Complex of Koguryo Tombs===
The Complex of Koguryo Tombs lies in Pyongyang, Pyong&#x27;an South Province, and Nampo City, South Hwanghae Province, North Korea. In July 2004 it became the first UNESCO World Heritage site north of the 38th parallel.

The site consists of 63 individual tombs from the later Goguryeo, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. It was founded around northern Korea and Manchuria around 32 BC, and the capital was moved to Pyongyang in 427. This kingdom dominated the region between the 5th and 7th century AD.

<text>lsh is a copyleft implementation of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol version 2, by the GNU Project including both server and client programs. Featuring Secure Remote Password protocol (SRP) as specified in secsh-srp besides, public-key authentication. Kerberos is somewhat supported as well. Currently however for password verification only, not as a single sign-on (SSO) method.

lsh was started from scratch and predates OpenSSH.

Karim Yaghmour concluded in 2003 that lsh was &quot;not fit for use&quot; in production embedded Linux systems, because of its dependencies upon other software packages that have a multiplicity of further dependencies. The lsh package requires the GNU MP library, zlib, and liboop, the latter of which in turn requires GLib, which then requires pkg-config. Yaghmour further notes that lsh suffers from cross-compilation problems that it inherits from glib. &quot;If ... your target isn&#x27;t the same architecture as your host,&quot; he states, &quot;LSH isn&#x27;t a practical choice at this time.&quot;

Debian provides packages of lsh as codice_1, codice_2, codice_3 and codice_4.

<text>Korean shamanism, also known as  () or Mu-ism (), is a religion from Korea. Scholars of religion classify it as a folk religion and sometimes regard it as one facet of a broader Korean vernacular religion distinct from Buddhism, Daoism, and Confucianism.

They also perform rituals, during which they offer food and drink to the gods and spirits or entertain them with storytelling, song, and dance. may take place in a private home or in a shrine, often located on a mountain. The divide into regional sub-types, the largest being the or , historically dominant in Korea&#x27;s northern regions, whose rituals involve them being personally possessed by deities or ancestral spirits. Another type is the of eastern and southern regions, whose rituals entail spirit mediumship but not possession.

Elements of the tradition may derive from prehistory. During the Joseon period, Confucian elites suppressed the with taxation and legal restrictions, deeming their rites to be improper. From the late 19th century, modernisers – many of whom were Christian – characterised as (superstition) and supported its suppression. During the Japanese occupation of the early 20th century, nationalistically oriented folklorists began promoting the idea that represented Korea&#x27;s ancient religion and a manifestation of its national culture; an idea later heavily promoted by themselves. In the mid-20th century, persecution of continued under the Marxist government of North Korea and through the New Community Movement in South Korea. More positive appraisal of the occurred in South Korea from the late 1970s onward, especially as practitioners were associated with the pro-democracy movement and came to be regarded as a source of Korean cultural identity.

 is primarily found in South Korea, where there are around 200,000 , although practitioners are also found abroad. While Korean attitudes to religion have historically been fairly inclusive, allowing for syncretism between and Buddhism, the have nevertheless long been marginalised. Disapproval of , often regarded as charlatans, remains widespread in South Korea, especially among Christians. has also influenced some Korean new religions, such as Cheondoism and Jeungsanism.

==Definition==
The anthropologist Chongho Kim noted that defining Korean shamanism was &quot;really problematic&quot;. He characterised &quot;Korean shamanism&quot; as a largely &quot;residual&quot; category into which all Korean religious practices that were not Buddhist, Confucian, or Christian were placed. Scholars like Griffin Dix, Kil-sŏng Ch&#x27;oe and Don Baker have conversely presented Korean shamanism as just one facet of &quot;Korean folk religion&quot;, the latter sometimes called in Korean.

Korean shamanism has varyingly been labelled a vernacular religion, a folk religion, a popular religion, and an indigenous religion. It is a non-institutionalized tradition, rather than being an organized religion akin to Buddhism or Christianity. It has no doctrine, nor any overarching hierarchy, and is orally transmitted. It displays considerable regional variation, as well as variation according to the choices of individual practitioners. Over time, the tradition has displayed both continuity and change.

One term commonly used for this tradition is (&quot; folklore&quot;), coined by the folklorist Yi Nŭnghwa. Although developed during the Japanese colonial period, when it was employed with derogatory connotations, the term has since become popular with the Korean population and with scholars; the Korean studies scholar Antonetta L. Bruno for instance capitalised it as to serve as a name for the religion. Alternative terms include , , and . In Korea, the term (&quot;superstition&quot;) is sometimes used for this religion, but is also applied to other religious and cultural practices like geomancy. While carries negative connotations in Korean culture, some use it to describe what they do.

Since the late 19th century, English language studies have referred to the as &quot;shamans&quot; and their practices as &quot;Korean shamanism&quot;, a label rendered into Korean as . Introduced to English from the Tungusic languages at the end of the 17th century, the term &quot;shamanism&quot; has never received a commonly agreed definition and has been used in at least four distinct ways. A common definition uses &quot;shamanism&quot; to describe traditions involving visionary flights to perform rituals in a spirit realm, a practice not found in Korean traditional religion. Many scholars avoid the term &quot;shaman&quot; as a cross-cultural category altogether. Its application to Korean religion is controversial, with Chongho Kim deeming it &quot;often unhelpful&quot;. The scholar Suk-Jay Yim proposed &quot;mu-ism&quot; as a more appropriate label than &quot;Korean shamanism&quot;, while Dix thought &quot;spirit mediumship&quot; more suitable than &quot;shamanism&quot;.

Prior to Christianity&#x27;s arrival in the 17th and 18th centuries, Korean religion was rarely exclusivist, with many Koreans practising Daoism, Buddhism, Confucianism, and simultaneously. Despite shared underlying beliefs, these traditions undertook a &quot;division of ritual and cosmological responsibility&quot; between each other. Confucian rituals were for example primarily concerned with ancestor veneration and tended to be simpler and more regular, whereas the would be brought in on rarer occasions. Korea has seen particular syncretism between and Buddhism; often identify as Buddhists, and commonly worship Buddhist deities, while some Korean Buddhist temples venerate deities traditionally associated with . In contemporary South Korea, it remains possible for followers of most religions (barring Christianity) to involve themselves in with little censure from their fellow religionists. Meanwhile, based in Europe have merged the tradition with New Age elements.

===Terms and types of practitioners===

Central to are those whom the anthropologist Kyoim Yun called &quot;ritual specialists who mediate between their clients and the invisible&quot; forces of the supernatural. The most common Korean term for these specialists is &quot;mudang&quot;, a label that encompasses various &quot;folk religion practitioners&quot; across the peninsula. 

Although commonly used, the term carries derogatory connotations in Korean culture and thus some practitioners avoid it. An alternative term is , the latter synonymous with the Chinese word &quot;wu&quot; (), also used for ritual specialists. Several modern advocacy groups have adopted the term , meaning &quot;people who do &quot;. While the term can apply to a man or woman, specific terms for male specialists include , or, more commonly used in the past, . Modern advocacy groups have also described supporters as (believers, ) or (believers in the ways of , ).

 are often divided into two broad types: the , or &quot;god-descended&quot; , and the or &quot;hereditary&quot; . The former engage in rituals in which they describe being possessed by supernatural entities; the latter&#x27;s rituals involve interaction with these entities but not possession. The former was historically more common in northern and central parts of the Korean peninsula, the latter in southern parts below the Han River. The tradition later spread and by the late 20th century was dominant across South Korea, with its ritual costumes and paraphernalia being widely adopted. 

Lines between the and are nevertheless blurred. Although the are typically presented as inheriting the role in a hereditary fashion, not all do so, while some continue the role of a family member as if maintaining a hereditary tradition. Yun commented that dividing the into distinct typologies &quot;cannot explain complex reality&quot;.

Certain regional terms are also used for the . The are often called in Jeolla Province, and on Jeju Island. The latter term was first recorded in the 15th century, used for on the Korean mainland, but by the early 19th century was exclusively used for practitioners on Jeju. An alternative term for the is , a term meaning &quot;ten thousand spirits/gods&quot;, and which has less derogatory connotations than the label .

Other terms sometimes used for may elsewhere be restricted to different types of Korean ritual specialist. The term , describing a spirit medium, is sometimes used synonymously with but at other times describes a distinct group of practitioners. Another term some adopt for themselves is (), originally a Korean term for a Buddhist bodhisattva, and which is favored more by female than male practitioners. Conversely, some maintain that the term should be reserved for diviners who are possessed by child spirits but who do not perform the rituals of the .

===Theology===


 is polytheistic. Supernatural beings are called , or . The divide these beings into two main groups, the gods and the ancestral spirits, although many use the term for all of them. Supernatural beings are seen as volatile; if humans do well by them, they can receive good fortune, but if they offend these entities then they may suffer. Devotees of these deities believe that they can engage, converse, and bargain with them. 

Each will have their own personal pantheon of deities, one that may differ from the pantheon of the they trained under. This individual pantheon is the , and a may add new deities to it during their career. Some will be considered guardian deities, each referred to as a . These deities bestow (&quot;divine energy&quot;) upon the , enabling the latter to have visions and intuition that allows them to perform their ritual tasks.

In Korean traditional religion, the deities are called , and typically take human form. The pantheon of deities, which has changed over time, is termed , with over 130 divinities having been identified. The deities can be divided into those embodying natural or cosmological forces and those who were once human, including monarchs, officials, and generals. Some derive from Daoist or Buddhist traditions and others are unique to Korean vernacular religion. They are deemed capable of manifesting in material forms, as in paintings or statues, or as inhabiting landscape locations such as trees, rocks, springs, and stone piles. The anthropologist Laurel Kendall suggested that the relationship that had with these spirit-inhabited sites was akin to animism.

The highest deities are often deemed remote and little interested in human affairs. The governing god in Korean tradition, referred to as Hananim, Hanallim, or Hanŭnim, is deemed to rule the heavens but is rarely worshipped. Some of the more powerful deities can make demands from humans without any obligation to reciprocate. Other deities are involved in everyday human concerns and prayed to accordingly. Many of the deities desire food and drink, spend money, and enjoy song and dance, and thus receive these things as offerings. Spirits of the dead are thought to yearn for the activities and pleasures they enjoyed in life; spirits of military generals are for instance believed to like dangerous games. The associations of particular deities can change over time; Hogu Pyŏlsŏng was for instance a goddess of smallpox, but after that disease&#x27;s eradication in the 20th century retained associations with measles and chickenpox.

Popular cosmological deities include Ch&#x27;ilsŏng, the spirit of the seven stars of the Big Dipper, who is regarded as a merciful Buddhist figure that cares for children. Yŏngdŏng is a goddess of the wind, popular in southern areas including Jeju. The mountain god, or mountain gods more broadly, are called , or sometimes , and are typically seen as the most important spirits of the earth. is typically depicted as a man with a white beard, blue gown, and accompanying tiger. Water deities, or , are dragons deemed to live in rivers, springs, and the sea. The most senior dragon is the Yong-Wang (Dragon King) who rules the oceans. Spirits of military generals are , and include the , the generals of the five cardinal points. Among the are historical figures like Ch&#x27;oeyŏng, Im Kyŏngŏp, Oh, and Chang, as well as more recent military figures; around Inchon, various have venerated General Douglas MacArthur as a hero of the Korean War.
Child deities are . The Korean traditional cosmology also includes mischievous spirits called , and entities called that can lodge in the family compound and cause trouble.

====Village and household spirits====

Villages traditionally had Jangseung, timber or occasionally stone posts representing two generals that guard the settlement from harmful spirits. On Jeju, these were constructed of volcanic rock and were respectively called the &quot;Harubang&quot; (grandfather) and &quot;Halmang&quot; (grandmother). Historically, villages would often hold annual festivals to thank their tutelary deities. These would often be overseen by local men and reflect Confucian traditions, although sometimes did participate. In Korean society, rapid urbanisation has radically changed how people interact with their local deities.

Korean vernacular religion includes household deities, the chief of which is Sŏngju, the principal house guardian. Others include T&#x27;oju taegum, who patrols the precincts of the household, Chowang the kitchen spirit, and Pyŏnso Kakssi, the protector of the toilet. Keeping these entities happy was traditionally regarded as the role of the housewife, and is achieved through offering them food and drink. These informal rituals do not require the involvement of , who would only be called in for special occasions.
Pollution caused by births or deaths in the household are believed to result in Sŏngju leaving, meaning that he must be encouraged to return through ritual. Sŏngju may also require propitiation if expensive goods are brought into the home, as he expects a portion of the expenditure to be devoted to him.

Ancestral spirits are called . Tutelary ancestors are termed . Ancestors who may be venerated in rituals are broader than the purely patrilineal figures venerated in formal Korean ancestor veneration rites, the . These broader ancestors may for instance include those from a woman&#x27;s natal family, women who have married out of the family, or family members who have died without offspring. While both the rites and the Confucian-derived entail communication with ancestors, only the former involves direct communication with these spirits, allowing the ancestors to convey messages directly to the living. Certain ancestral spirits can also form part of a personal pantheon.
A personal spiritual guardian is the (plural ). The of male are usually deemed female; those of female are typically male.

===Cosmology and mythology===

In Korean religion, a &quot;fundamental cosmology&quot; has influenced various traditions, including &quot;musok&quot;.
Korean shamanic narratives include a number of myths that discuss the origins of shamans or the shamanic religion. These include, the Princess Bari myth, the Gongsim myth, and the myth. Origin myths are often called . These narratives have been extensively collected and studied by Korean scholars. During a ritual held for the dead, an epic ballad called the Tale of Princess Pari is often recited.

One of the most widespread myths in Korean Shamanism is known as the Myth of Dangun, the legendary founder of the first Korean kingdom Gojoseon. Dangun is sometimes considered the first . This myth refers to the belief that God would come from heaven. This would result in the earth and heaven being unified. God and human beings would be unified as well. Korean Shamanism believes that the goddess mother of earth is married to the heavenly God.

The Myth of Dangun has become the founding myth of the Korean nation.

===Birth and the dead===

A common belief in Korean vernacular religion is that spirits of the dead wander the human world before entering the afterlife.
After death, the soul must stand trial in court and pass through gates kept by the Ten Kings. At this court, the dead are judged for their conduct in life. The Ten Gates of Hell are regarded as places of punishment for the wicked, typified by grotesque and gory scenes. According to the Princess Bari narrative, Ascension from Hell to Paradise is possible through prayer and devotion.

The dead are regarded as intrinsically dangerous to the living as their touch causes affliction, regardless of whether they mean harm or not. Those who died prematurely or who feel their life was unfulfilled, such as grandparents who never saw their grandchildren, a first wife who was replaced by a second wife, those who died by drowning, and young people who died before they could marry, are all considered especially antagonistic to the living and thus particularly dangerous.
Meddlesome ghosts are thought to often enter the house on a piece of cloth, clothing, or bright object. A dead ancestor who has not been appropriately cared or has been given an unsuitable burial place is deemed likely to cause trouble for its living descendants.

If a person suffers a tragic or untimely death, it is believed that their soul hovers between life and death and can cause misfortune for their family; they thus need to be dealt with through ritual.
Terms for wandering spirits include and , and are deemed best suited for dealing with them, because they can determine what they want and tell them to go away.

On Jeju Island, since the late 1980s there have been public lamentations of the dead involving to mark those killed in the Jeju uprising of 1948.

==Practices==

===&quot;Mudang&quot;===

The mediate between the human and supernatural worlds, doing so in an attempt to decrease human suffering and ensure a more harmonious life. Specifically, they interact with gods and ancestral spirits by divining their presence and will, performing small rituals to placate them and gain their favor, and overseeing the rituals to feast and entertain them. The &#x27;s ability to perform their rituals successfully is deemed to come from (&quot;divine energy&quot;) bestowed upon them by the deities. Thus, divine favor must be gained through purification and supplication, prayer and pilgrimage.
Individual can be regarded as having particular specialities.

For the , ritual is an economic activity, and they operate as free agents rather than members of an ordained clergy. For many practitioners, being a is a full-time job on which they financially depend, although some fail to earn a living through this ritual vocation. To succeed financially, must attract regular clientele, and to that end modern South Korean practitioners have advertised their services in brochures, fliers, newspapers, and on the Internet. Some followers of are unhappy with this situation, believing that the practice has degenerated under capitalism and modernisation; they feel that modern display a more materialistic and self-interested approach than their historical predecessors.

====Becoming a &quot;mudang&quot;====

Many report that they never wanted to take up the profession, resisting the calling due to the social disapproval that practitioners often face. However, teaches that it is the deities who decide if a person is to become a and that they will torment an individual with misfortune, illness or madness to encourage them into adopting the profession. This process is termed the (&quot;the drought caused by the gods&quot;), (&quot;spirit possession sickness&quot;), or (&quot; sickness&quot;). have for instance reported partial paralysis and hallucinations before turning to this ritual vocation, or else a compulsion to go to a shrine or sacred mountain. Alternatively, they have described encounters with spirits, sometimes while wandering in a wild environment, or otherwise through dreams, with dreams and visions sometimes revealing which deities the future is expected to serve.

Once the person has accepted the calling, they must find an established willing to train them. They become this person&#x27;s apprentice, the . Apprentices are usually aged over 18, although there are examples of children becoming apprentices. The apprentice of a may be called their or (spirit daughter) if female, or (spirit son) if male. The will be that novice&#x27;s . The neophyte must ultimately perform an initiation ritual to open up (the &quot;gates of speech&quot;) that will allow them to receive the words of the spirits. This rite is called the . It involves the neophyte performing the appropriate chants, dances, and oracles to invoke and convey inspiration from the deities. If the initiate fails to perform this correctly, with the deities failing to open their , they will have to perform it again. Many perform multiple before being recognised as properly initiated ritual specialists. Those who fail to learn how to deal with supernatural entities correctly are sometimes called by other practitioners.

In the tradition, teachings are often passed down hereditarily although in other instances a adopts a non-relative, rather than their child, as an apprentice. Not all practitioners want their children to follow them into the profession, however. When do not wish a family member to continue their vocation, they may ensure that their ritual paraphernalia is burned or buried at their death; doing so severs any connection between their person deities and their surviving family.

====Clients of the &quot;mudang&quot;====

Serving private clients is the core practice for most , even those who have built celebrity status through their performance of staged . In some areas, including Jeju, clients are called . Clients seek solutions to their practical problems, typically hoping that the can ascertain the cause of misfortune they have suffered. Common reasons for doing so include recurring nightmares, concerns about a child getting into university, financial woes, business concerns, or physical ailments. Some clients turn to the after being dissatisfied with the diagnosis or treatment administered by medical professionals.

Although both sexes do consult , most clients are female. From his fieldwork in the 1990s, Chongho Kim found that most clients were women in their late fifties and early sixties, while that same decade Kendall noted that most clients in Seoul and its environs were small entrepreneurs, such as owners of small companies, shops, and restaurants. By the early 21st century, Sarfati observed, many young people had become clients of as part of a spiritual search or for counselling. Clients do not generally regard themselves as being committed exclusively to , and may deem themselves Buddhists or Christians, but often think that their rituals will please the spirits regardless of their client&#x27;s beliefs.

A client will often arrive, greet the , and then engage in an introductory conversation. Through this, the will hope to ascertain more about the client and their problems. The then uses divination and trance visions to determine the source of their client&#x27;s trouble; in , neglecting ancestors and gods is seen as the primary cause of affliction. The may then try to convince their client of the need for a particular ritual to treat their problem.

If a ritual fails to produce the desired result, the client may speculate that it was because of a bad performer, errors in the ritual, the presence of a ritually polluted attendee, or a lack of sincerity on their part. If the client feels the has not successfully solved their problem, they may turn to another . They may be disappointed or angry given their substantial financial investment; in some rare cases clients have sued . The payment of money is often a source of mistrust between clients and . Concerns about money are heightened by the lack of an &quot;institutional buffer&quot; between the client and ritual practitioner, such as a temple or church.

===Altars and shrines===

Most rituals center around altars—referred to as , , or —and which serve as places for to engage with supernatural beings. typically have a shrine in their home in which they host various gods and ancestors, sometimes set up in a cabinet. Shrines might alternatively be found outdoors, often incorporating a stone or old tree, while a will often establish a temporary altar in a client&#x27;s home.

While each altar often has its own idiosyncratic elements, they are typically dominated by bright, primary colors, in contrast to the muted earth tones traditionally predominant in Korean daily life. This home shrine may include paintings of deities, called , , , or . These paintings are particularly important in the traditions of Seoul and of the northwest provinces Hwanghae and P&#x27;yŏngan; they were traditionally not found in parts of the south. Hanging above the altar, they are usually considered the most important objects present. They are regarded as seats for the deities, literally manifesting the latter&#x27;s presence rather than just visually depicting them, an idea similar to those found across much of Asia, as in Buddhism and Hinduism. As well as being invited to inhabit a painting, a deity may also be petitioned to depart it; they are sometimes believed to leave of their own accord, for instance if they abandon a who keeps the image.

 paintings range from being crude to more sophisticated. Traditionally they use colors associated with the five directions (): red, blue/green, yellow, white, and black. Painters who produce are traditionally expected to adhere to standards of purity while producing these artworks, bathing beforehand and refraining from eating fish or meat. Since the 1970s, have commonly been produced in commercial workshops, although a small number of traditional artists remain in South Korea. After a &#x27;s death, their were often ritually de-animated and then burned during the 20th century. Some have been donated to museums; certain practitioners believe that the deity leaves the image if that occurs.

On the shrine, deities may also be represented by , statues made of wood, plastic, clay, straw, or metal. Alternatively, deities may be represented by a white piece of paper, the or , onto which the entity&#x27;s name is written in black or red ink. The deity may instead be seated in physical objects, including stones, clothing, coins, dolls, or knives; these may be concealed from view, for instance being wrapped in cloth or inside a chest. In addition to entities associated with specifically, shrines may also include images of Buddhist deities. Alongside representations of such beings, shrines typically have candles, incense holders, and offering bowls; there may also be toys or dolls to amuse the child gods. The altar will also often be a place to store or display their ritual paraphernalia, such as costumes.

To sustain their ongoing favor, often worship their deities daily. Thus, they often bow when in the presence of their home shrine, and then place offerings upon it. Some offerings, such as cooked rice, fruit, and water, may be changed daily; others, such as sweets, cigarettes, and liquor, may be replaced more infrequently. maintain that they provide offerings in thanks for the work their deities have brought them. For visiting clients, who may also place offerings at a home-shrine, a large assortment of offerings thus gives the impression of a financially successful ritual specialist.

Deities are often believed to be present in all houses. Historical accounts often reference the presence of earthen jars (, , ) filled with grain, or smaller baskets or pouches, as offerings to household deities and ancestors. This practice was declining in South Korea by the 1960s and 1970s. By the latter decades of the 20th century, cardboard boxes had become common receptacles for these household offerings. Some have suggested that, because most South Koreans now live in apartments, the Sŏngju must be venerated in a way that ensures it is mobile and can be transported to a new home.

====&quot;Guttang&quot; and &quot;pugundang&quot;====

Specialised buildings at which rituals are performed are called or () and are typically located on mountains. 
 are often identified on the exterior by a symbol, a circular swirl of red, blue, and yellow that symbolizes the cosmos. The main ritual room is called the , and often contains a table on which offerings are placed. often rent a to perform their rituals, especially if they do not have space for such rites in their home.

Practitioners often believe that deities communicate with humans through dreams as a means of choosing specific locales for the placement of . Some are located at especially auspicious places, such as at an area below a mountain, the , where positive spiritual energy is thought to congregate. sometimes move over time. The , which Kendall described as &quot;Seoul&#x27;s most venerable &quot;, for instance was originally on South Mountain, before being displaced by a Shinto shrine during the Japanese occupation, at which it moved to Inwangsan, a mountain to the north of the city. The growing urbanisation of South Korea since the late 20th century has meant that many are now surrounded by other buildings, sometimes including other . The increasingly cramped nature of Korean urban living may have encouraged the increasing popularity of in isolated locations like mountains.

 often operate as businesses. They rent out rooms for to use, a practice perhaps originating in the late Joseon period. The will have a shrine keeper, who may be a themselves. Other staff based there may include musicians called , cooks who prepare food for rituals, and a maid, the , who is a trainee yet to undergo their initiation rite. As well as spaces for ritual, also provide places for networking, allowing to witness the rituals of other practitioners and observe different regional styles.

Shrines dedicated to significant tutelary spirits are known as or . Historically, these were often the foci for local cults, such as those devoted to apotheosised heroes. In parts of South Korea, as on Jeju Island, new village shrines have continued to be created into the early 21st century, with various Jeju villages having more than one shrine. 

=== rites===


The central ritual of the is called . These are large-scale rites, characterised by rhythmic movements, songs, oracles and prayers. They are the only rituals in traditional Korean religion believed to give supernatural entities the ability to speak directly to humans, and are meant to create welfare, promoting commitment between supernatural beings and humankind. The purpose of a is to get the supernatural beings to communicate, expressing what it is that they want and why they are angry. There is regional diversity in the styles of , although some mix these different styles, with each displaying features unique to its particular circumstances. Central to rituals is a reciprocal transaction between humans and supernatural entities. These rituals are typically performance-focused, rather than being rooted in a prescribed liturgy, and can last for up to several days. 

A is sponsored for a specific purpose. A may be arranged due to an illness, domestic quarrel, or financial loss. It might be undertaken to propitiate the spirit of a deceased family member, or to increase prosperity and good fortune; in the 21st century, it has become increasingly common to sponsor a to mark a new financial venture, such as the opening of a mall or an office building. As well as being performed for clients, the will sometimes perform these rituals for their own personal reasons; in the 1990s, for instance, the prominent Kim Kŭm-hwa performed a for Korean reunification.

Financial payment for a is typical, although the fee varies between and the circumstances of the rite. However, a is usually very expensive for the client of a ; based on his fieldwork in the 1990s, Chongho Kim noted that a in Seoul typically cost between 2 and 5 million won, whereas in the rural area of Soy it cost between 300,000 and 2.5 million won. The precise fee may be negotiated between the and their client, sometimes involving haggling. This will usually be agreed at a pre- consultation. As well as paying for the time, the fee also covers the wages of any assistants and the costs of material used in the rite; it may also reflect the years of training they have undertaken to be able to perform these rituals.

The is usually held in private, and few have a larger audience than the direct participants like the client, although there are instances where those paying for a will invite neighbors to observe. On occasion, a busy client will not attend the they have sponsored. These rituals are typically regarded as unsuitable for children to attend. Often it will take place outdoors and at night, in an isolated rural location, at a shrine rented for the occasion, or in a private home, either that of the , or that of their client. Setting up the may involve not only the but also their apprentices, assistants, musicians, butchers, and cooks. Preparing and decorating the space is deemed a meaningful part of the ritual process, with those setting it up often concerned so as not to offend the spirits.

Colorful paintings of the gods will often be brought into the space where the is to be performed; this is not part of the performed by Jeju . God paintings are usually paper, although in modern contexts are sometimes polyester, ensuring that they are resistant to rain and tearing. Other practitioners regard the use of polyester images as a corruption of tradition. These images are then often hung on a metal frame. In Taejŏn City and Ch&#x27;ungch&#x27;ŏng province, a traditional practice involves decorating the ritual space with handmade mulberry paper cut into patterns. Various ritual items may be included in the ritual, including swords, the , a drum, drum stick, and the spirit stick. The is a three-pronged spear. The is a prayer card used in the onto which information like the name of the client may be written. The may then be attached to a drum.

====Offerings at the &quot;gut&quot;====

At , food is offered to the spirits. This will often include fish, rice, &quot;tteok&quot; rice cakes, eggs, sweets, nuts, biscuits, fruit, and meat. Some of this food will be cooked, some will be offered raw. To provide meat, animal sacrifice occurs at most , although is rare in televisual, cinematic, and museum depictions of these rites. A cow or pig killed for the purpose may be butchered in the shrine room; the carcass may be impaled on the trident; if it fails to balance, then this is seen as evidence that the deities do not accept the offering.
When the ritual is intended to invoke Buddhist spirits, the food offerings may be vegetarian; offering these entities meat would offend them. Food offerings may also be set out at the side for wandering spirits who are attracted by the ritual, an act designed to avoid mishaps they could cause.

Offered alongside the food will often be alcoholic drinks, typically , as well as non-food items like incense, cloth, money (both real and imitation), and paper flowers. The color of the flowers may indicate to whom they are offered; pink for the spirits of military generals, white for Buddhist deities, and multi-colored for ancestral spirits. The material used for the will often be bought in a shop, which specialises in traditional religious paraphernalia. In modern South Korea, the ritual paraphernalia used is often of poor quality because it is intended to be burnt following the ceremony.

These may be placed on offering tables; one table will be the , devoted to the gods, while the other table will be the , devoted to ancestral spirits. The will often perform divination to determine if the offerings have been accepted by the supernatural beings. It is considered important for the person giving these offerings to do so with sincerity and devotion, with the mudang undertaking a form of divination called &quot;weighing the sincerity&quot; () to determine if this has been the case. The emotional influence on the audience is considered evidence of its efficacy.

During the ritual, attendees may be expected to give additional offerings of money to the , often while they are possessed, intended as thanks both to them and to the spirits. These offerings, given in addition to the ritual fee, are called or . Any real money presented as offerings to the deities will be taken by the .
Much of the food assembled for the will then be distributed and consumed by the attendees at the end of the ritual, having been charged by auspiciousness by its involvement in the rite. Attendees may distribute some of this food to non-attendees once they get home; they may also set some aside to feed any wandering spirits that might have followed them from the . In some , especially those held at shrines, food will also be left to decay.

====Performance at the &quot;gut&quot;====
The ritual begins with the inviting supernatural entities to the altar, after which they set out to entertain them. Music will often be involved in the .
Musical instruments typically involved in include cymbals, hourglass-shaped drums called , and a gong. Also sometimes featured is a pipe, the . The will often begin with drumming. The will often dance to the beat of the drums, often swirling in circles, something believed to facilitate the possession trance. They may hold ,
short sticks to which white paper streamers are attached; this helps channel the spirits into the body. The may also carry a fan and brass bells; Sarfati commented that these bells were &quot;a central symbol of musok&quot;, and their purpose is to attract the attention of the spirits.

The language used by a during their rite is called (&quot;&#x27;s sounds&quot;), and is often deliberately archaic. The songs or chants employed are called , with each practitioner having their own personal repertoire, largely inherited through oral tradition. As well as traditional folk songs, some have sung pop songs to entertain the spirits.
Incantations and ritual words for communicating with the spirit are called . The will often recite mythological stories during the ritual, something deemed to contribute to its efficacy. These may be recited in full at a longer ritual or in condensed form for a shorter one. There may be breaks during the , for instance giving time for the participants to eat.

The costumes worn for these rituals are called . These colorful outfits resemble those documented from the 19th and early 20th centuries, and may involve a . The may distinguish themselves from their assistants by having their hair in the Tchokchin mŏri style.
For the , the will dress in clothes representing the deities, with different deities associated with different items of clothing. They may change outfit over the course of the to reflect the different entities possessing them. This is not a practice that the engage in.

Also used in many are blades, objects symbolizing the bravery of the possessing warrior spirits. The may stab themselves in the chest with the knives, run the blade along their tongue, or press it to their face and hands.

===Purification===
Purity of both the body and the mind is a state that is required for taking part in rituals. Purification is considered necessary for an efficacious communion between living people and ancestral forms. Before any is performed, the altar is always purified by fire and water, as part of the first of the ritual itself. The colour white, extensively used in rituals, is regarded as a symbol of purity. The purification of the body is performed by burning white paper.

===Mountains, landscape, and pilgrimage===

In , spiritually potent sites include rocks, springs, and trees. The latter trees may be marked out by having strips of cloth or paper attached to them. Mountains are often deemed places of sacred presence and associated with &#x27;s origin. Each prominent mountain is deemed to have a sovereign mountain spirit. The levels of spiritual power at a mountain are influenced not just by its associated deities but also the energy (the equivalent of the Chinese &quot;qi&quot;) that is present there. This is believed to channel through (&quot;veins&quot;) through the mountain landscape; these can be disrupted by roads or other construction. Thus, the potency of these mountains is thought to decline amid growing urbanisation and tourist access. In Korea, this traditional geomancy is called , and is akin to the Chinese &quot;fengshui&quot;.

Pilgrimages to mountain shrines have long been part of Korean religion. Historically, the mountain pilgrimages were rare events, although improved transportation meant that by the 1990s these had become more regular occurrences in South Korea. Some prepare for these pilgrimages by bathing and abstaining from eating meat, fish, or eggs. On arrival at the shrine, the pilgrim will bow and give offerings. For , these mountains are places to replenish their and are conducive to receiving visions. will make offerings not only at the mountains but also at springs and guardian trees &quot;en route&quot;. Those reaching the summit of a mountain will often add a pebble to a cairn to propitiate that mountain&#x27;s .

The most sacred mountain for the is Mount Paektu, located on North Korea&#x27;s northern border with China; this is believed to channel to every other mountain in the peninsula. According to legend, it is also the birthplace of Tan&#x27;gun, the national ancestor and first . Since the 1990s, from South Korea have travelled to China to make pilgrimages to this mountain.

===Talismans and divination===
An important component of the role is to produce talismans called () which are presented as providing the bearer with good fortune. These are often based on Hanja, Korean versions of Chinese logograms. These may be distributed to attendees at the end of a rite. Clients will often affix these to the internal walls of their home.

Divination is termed . One form of divination, sometimes performed during other rituals, involves a person picking one of a selection of rolled up silk flags; the color of the selected flag is then interpreted as bearing meaning for that individual. Green and yellow flags are often seen as indicating bad fortune, while red is regarded as being auspicious. The style of divination involves casting rice and coins onto a tray, while another practice entails shaking rice kernels onto a person&#x27;s lap and then drawing meaning from whether they are of an odd or even number.

In Korean vernacular religion, there are also ritual specialists who perform divinations and produce amulets but who do not engage in rituals like the .

==History==

It is difficult to determine the origins of &quot;musok&quot;.
Detailed accounts of rituals prior to the modern period are rare, and the fact that the tradition is orally transmitted means it is difficult to trace historical processes.

===Prehistory===

Some historians have argued that has common origins with other traditions labelled &quot;shamanic&quot; in parts of North Asia, suggesting a common origin in prehistory.
Korean shamanism goes back to prehistoric times, pre-dating the introduction of Buddhism and Confucianism, and the influence of Taoism, in Korea. Over time, elements from other traditions, such as Buddhism, Confucianism, and Daoism, were absorbed into its practices. Vestiges of temples dedicated to gods and spirits have been found on tops and slopes of many mountains in the peninsula.

Shamanism can be traced back to 1,000 BC. The religion has been part of the culture of the Korean Peninsula since then. &quot;Historically, Korean Shamanism (Musok) was an orally transmitted tradition that was mastered mainly by illiterate low-ranking women within the neo-Confucian hierarchy.&quot; However, several records and texts have documented the origin of Korean Shamanism. One of these texts is &quot;Wei Shi&quot; which traces Shamanism to the third century. Chinese dynastic histories mention the importance of designated shamans among early religious practices in Japan but not Korea. The Korean studies scholar Richard D. McBride thus asserts that non-shamans were able to practice &quot;under their own authority&quot;. Evidently, the history of Korean Shamanism remains a mystery. However, foreign religions, including Christianity, Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism have influenced the development of Korean Shamanism.

The development of Korean Shamanism can be categorized into different groups. The first category involves simple transformation. In this transformation, the influence of the practices and beliefs of other religions on Korean Shamanism was superficial. The second category of transmission was syncretistic. This category involves Shamanism being incorporated into the practices and beliefs of other cultures, including Confucianism, Christianity, Taoism, and Buddhism. These religions had different levels of influence on Korean Shamanism. The third category involves the formation of new religions through the mixing of beliefs and practices of Shamanism with those of other dominant religions.

Although many Koreans converted to Buddhism when it was introduced to the peninsula in the 4th century, and adopted as the state religion in Silla and Goryeo, it remained a minor religion compared to Korean shamanism.

The term is first recorded in the 12th-century . It also appears in the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; from that century.
The use of images of the deities, hanging on the wall, is first recorded from the 13th century.

===Joseon Korea and Japanese occupation===

The Goryeo kingdom was replaced by the Joseon dynasty, which saw an increase in governmental persecution of the . Confucianism was the dominant ideology in Joseon Korea, contributing to these suppressions; later historians argued that this was connected to the elite&#x27;s desire to gain more power by challenging rivals to their Confucian system. Confucians accepted the existence of the spirits invoked in the rites, but argued that there were better ways of dealing with these supernatural beings. They regarded the rituals as improper, criticising the presence of both sexes together in environments where alcohol was being consumed. Korea&#x27;s Neo-Confucian scholars used the derogatory term for non-Confucian ceremonies, of which they considered the rituals among the lowest.

In the Joseon dynasty, belonged to one of eight outcast groups that were expelled from the capital city. The law book prescribed 100 lashes in public for anyone found to be supporting them. This persecution could prove deadly; in an extreme case, a was beheaded in 1398. In an oft-cited incident, Jeju governor Yi Hyŏngsang initiated a purge of on the island in 1702, destroying 129 shrines. Taxes were levied on the rituals, both to discourage the practice but also to raise revenues for the government; these taxes remained in place until the 1895 Kabo reforms. At the same time as the government persecuted the , they also turned to them in emergencies like epidemics, droughts, and famines. Several were permitted access to the royal palaces, where several structures were set aside for their usage.

By the late 19th century, many Korean intellectuals eager for modernisation came to regard as superstition that should be eradicated; they increasingly referred to it with the term (&quot;superstition&quot;). These ideas were endorsed in &quot;Tongnip sinmun&quot;, Korea&#x27;s first vernacular newspaper. Many of these intellectuals were Christian, thus regarding the spirits as evil demons. In 1896, police launched a crackdown by arresting , destroying shrines, and burning paraphernalia.

The Japanese Empire invaded Korea in 1910. During the Japanese occupation, the occupiers tried to incorporate within, or replace it with, State Shinto. The Japanese colonial Governor-General of Chōsen presented the as evidence for Korean cultural backwardness, an approach intended to legitimize Japanese imperial rule. Japanese efforts to suppress the tradition included the Mind Cultivation Movement launched in 1936. Korean elites largely supported these suppressions for a variety of reasons, one of which was to demonstrate Korean cultural advancement to the Japanese occupying Korea.

It was in this colonial context that scholars developed the idea that the were continuing an ancient Korean religion and thus represented the spiritual and cultural repository of the Korean people. Influenced by the Western use of the term &quot;shamanism&quot; as a cross-cultural category, some Korean scholars speculated that the tradition descended from Siberian traditions. The Japanese scholar Torii Ryūzō proposed the as a remnant of a primordial Shinto, with both stemming from Siberian &quot;shamanism&quot;. These ideas were built on by nationalist Korean scholars Ch&#x27;oe Nam-sŏn and Yi Nŭnghwa in the 1920s. Cho&#x27;e reversed Torii&#x27;s framework by emphasising the primacy of ancient Korean over Japanese tradition as the transmitter of Siberian religion, while Yi promoted the tradition as the residue of what he called (&quot;divine teachings&quot;), meaning a primordial Korean religion that lost its purity through the arrival of Confucianism and Buddhism. At the time, Korean elites remained wary about this new positive reassessment.

===Korean War and Division===

The situation for worsened after the division of Korea and the establishment of a northern Socialist government and a southern pro-Christian government. The Korean War and subsequent urbanisation of Korean society resulted in many Koreans moving around the peninsula, impacting the distinct regional traditions of the . Many from Hwanghae (in North Korea) resettled in Inchon (in South Korea), strongly influencing there, for example. This migration meant that by the early 21st century, were increasingly dominant in areas like Jeju where historically predominated, generating rivalry between the two traditions.

In North Korea, most formal religious activity was suppressed, with labelled part of the &quot;hostile class&quot;. In South Korea, Christianity spread rapidly from the 1960s, becoming the country&#x27;s dominant religion by the 21st century. South Korean leader Syngman Rhee launched the (&quot;New Life Movement&quot;) which destroyed many village shrines. This policy continued as the &quot;Saemaul Undong&quot; (&quot;New Community Movement&quot;) of his successor, Park Chung Hee, which led to a surge in the police suppression of during the 1970s. In response, formed the Tae Han Sŭngkong yŏngsin yŏnhap-hoe (Korean Victory Over Communism Federation of Shamans) to promote their interests, its name reflecting the pervasive anti-communist atmosphere of South Korean society. Such outright persecution ended after Park&#x27;s assassination in 1979.

The popularization of folklore studies in the 1970s resulted in the notion of as Korea&#x27;s ancient tradition gaining acceptance among growing numbers of educated South Koreans. In 1962, South Korea had introduced a Cultural Properties Protection Law that recognised performing arts as intangible cultural heritage; some folklorists used this to help defend the . In the latter part of the 20th century, the rituals were increasingly revived as a form of theatrical performance linked to cultural conservation and tourism. From the 1980s onward, South Korea&#x27;s government designated certain as Human Cultural Treasures. One of the best-known examples was Kim Geum-hwa, who from the 1980s performed for foreign anthropologists, toured Western countries, and appeared in documentaries. Reflecting the view of as an important part of Korea&#x27;s cultural heritage, a was depicted on a South Korean postage stamp while elements were included at the Seoul 1988 Olympic Arts Festival and the 1988 inauguration of President Roh Tae-woo. Paintings of deities became increasingly collectable in the 1980s and 1990s.

The were often regarded favorably within South Korea&#x27;s (Popular Culture Movement) pro-democracy campaign from the 1970s; several were active in the movement and became emblematic of its struggle. Advocacy groups were also formed to advance the cause of the , keen to present the tradition as lying at the heart of Korean culture, while the 1980s also saw begin to write books about themselves. also adapted to new technologies; from the 1990s they increasingly used the Internet to advertise their services, while portrayals of became widespread on South Korean television in the 2010s. This increasing cultural visibility improved the social image.

Since the early 19th century, a number of movements of revitalization or innovation of traditional Korean shamanism arose. They are characterized by an organized structure, a codified doctrine, and a body of scriptural texts. They may be grouped into three major families: the family of Daejongism or Dangunism, the Donghak-originated movements (including Cheondoism and Suunism), and the family of Jeungsanism (including Jeung San Do, Daesun Jinrihoe, the now-extinct Bocheonism, and many other sects).

==Demographics==
Most are female, something that may connect to origin myths that present as first developing among women. Approximately a fifth of are male, although the latter are proportionately over-represented in 21st-century media representations. There is regional variation in these gender differences; on Jeju Island, there were more male than female prior to the 1950s, and proportions of male practitioners remain higher there than on the Korean mainland. have conventionally belonged to the lowest social class; Chongho Kim noted that most he encountered in the 1990s were both financially poor and had little formal education.

Determining the number of is difficult. In 1983, around 43,000 people were members unions, while in the early 21st century, Sarfati estimated the number of at being over 200,000. Rather than being evenly distributed throughout South Korea, concentrations were higher in Seoul, and on Jeju. The number of as a whole does not appear to be decreasing, although the hereditary , including the Jeju , are &quot;in steep decline&quot;. is not recorded in the South Korean census because the government does not regard adherence to it as being akin to identifying as a Christian or a Buddhist. A late 20th-century survey by the Korean Gallup Research Institute indicated that 38 percent of the adult population of South Korea had used a . In North Korea, according to demographic analyses by Religious Intelligence, approximately 16 percent of the population practises &quot;traditional ethnic&quot; religion.

Since at least the 20th century, have travelled abroad to perform rituals; many for instance serve clients in Japan&#x27;s Korean minority. There are also in Europe, and a small number of non-Koreans have become ; a 2007 documentary covered the story of a German . Kendall noted the existence of one living outside Korea who was promoting their teachings through New Age-style workshops.

==Reception==

 has been suppressed throughout Korean history under a succession of dominant ideologies including Confucianism, Japanese colonialism, and Christianity. At the start of the 21st century, the remained widely stigmatized in South Korean society, facing widespread prejudice. In 2021, Sarfati observed that while the religion was &quot;still stigmatized&quot;, it was experiencing &quot;growing acceptance&quot; in South Korea.

The religion&#x27;s critics often regard as swindlers, people who manipulate the gullible. Critics regularly focus their critique on the large sums of money that the charge, and maintain that the expenses required for its rituals are wasteful. Critics have also accused of disrupting the civil order with their rituals. Kendall noted that there was a &quot;generally adversarial relationship&quot; between and Protestants in South Korea, the latter regarding as &quot;Devil worship&quot;, although there are also Protestants who have commissioned . Mainline Protestant theologians have sometimes blamed for predisposing Koreans to Pentecostalism and the idea that prayer can generate financial reward. Christians have sometimes harassed at their places of work or during their ceremonies, something which some regard as religious discrimination.

 began appearing in South Korean film in the 1960s. Early portrayals in the 1960s and 1970s generally showed them as harmful, frightening, and anti-modern figures, as in &quot;Ssal&quot; (1963), &quot;Munyŏdo&quot; (1972) and &quot;Iŏdo&quot; (1977). From the mid-2000s, films increasingly portrayed them as members of a living tradition situated in modern urban environments, as in &quot;Ch&#x27;ŏngham Posal&quot; (2009) and &quot;Paksu Kŏndal&quot; (2013). The 2000s also saw several successful documentaries about appear in Korean cinemas, as well as increasing appearances of on Korean television. Korean artists who have cited rituals as an influence on their work include Nam June Paik, who recreated an exorcism for several performances from the late 1970s. has also been presented in museums, although often with emphasis placed on its folkloric and aesthetic value rather than its role as a religious practice. South Korea&#x27;s government often embrace as a traditional performing artform, but marginalise its religious function.

<text>Stonington is a town located on Long Island Sound in New London County, Connecticut, United States. The municipal limits of the town include the borough of Stonington, the villages of Pawcatuck, Lords Point, and Wequetequock, and the eastern halves of the villages of Mystic and Old Mystic. Stonington is part of the Southeastern Connecticut Planning Region. The population of the town was 18,335 at the 2020 census. The town is home to many restored homes and preserves its long nautical history. 

==History==
The first European colonists to arrive include William Chesebrough and Walter Palmer in Wequetequock, Thomas Minor in Quiambaug, and Thomas Stanton in Pawcatuck. Stanton established a trading house in the Pawcatuck section of town in 1649. The present territory of Stonington was part of lands that had belonged to the Pequot people, who referred to the areas making up Stonington as &quot;Paquatuck&quot; (Stony Brook to the Pawcatuck River) and &quot;Mistack&quot; (Mystic River to Stony Brook). It was named &quot;Souther Towne&quot; or Southerton by Massachusetts in 1658, and officially became part of Connecticut in 1662 when Connecticut received its royal charter. Southerton was renamed &quot;Mistick&quot; in 1665, and finally named Stonington in 1666, meaning &quot;stony town&quot;. The town of North Stonington was set off as a parish from Stonington in 1724 and incorporated as a town in 1807. 

Sir Thomas Hardy led a British squadron during the War of 1812 consisting of HMS &quot;Ramillies&quot;, HMS &quot;Pactolus&quot;, HMS&quot; Dispatch&quot;, and HMS &quot;Terror&quot;. The ships appeared off Stonington Point on August 9, 1814, and Hardy demanded that the town surrender. The town Selectmen replied with a note which stated, &quot;We shall defend the place to the last extremity; should it be destroyed, we shall perish in its ruins.&quot;

Hardy&#x27;s squadron then bombarded Stonington for three days using stinkpots, while American forces in the town responded by firing at the British warships with two 18-pounder cannons. The only American casualty from the bombardment was an elderly woman who was already mortally ill, while Hardy&#x27;s squadron suffered several killed and wounded before sailing away on August 12. American poet Philip Freneau wrote:

A memorial in Cannon Square at the center of Stonington Borough was constructed to memorialize the 1814 bombardment that became known as the Battle of Stonington. It consists of the two 18-pounder cannons that were used by American forces during the engagement and a granite obelisk.

From the 1790s onward, Stonington experienced an economic upturn as its harbor became home to a fleet of American merchant ships engaged in seal hunting, targeting whales off the Patagonian coastline and selling their skins in China. Six sealing ships from Stonington commanded by Benjamin Pendleton set sail in 1820 to hunt whales off Deception Island, and on November 16, 1820 Nathaniel Palmer first sighted Palmer Land, which was named for him.

The Stonington Harbor Light is a low stone building erected in 1840. In 1925, it became the flagship museum of the Stonington Historical Society, making it the oldest lighthouse museum in America. During the 19th century, Stonington supported a small fishing, whaling, and sealing fleet that carried out trade with the West Indies—with enough volume for it to be made a port of entry in 1842. This saw a huge explosion in Portuguese immigration to the village from the Azores via whaling vessels. The small granite Customs House faces Main Street just north of Cannon Square. 

The Groton and Stonington Street Railway was a trolley line created in 1904 to serve the Stonington area. The trolley was dismantled and replaced by buses in 1928. In recent decades, Stonington has experienced a large influx of new home owners using historic Stonington Borough houses as second homes. The town has undergone a widespread reconditioning of these homes since the mid-1990s, when an altercation over property rights attracted substantial news coverage about Stonington&#x27;s revitalization. Today, Stonington is home to the last commercial fishing fleet in Connecticut.

<text>The Saccopharyngiformes are a derived lineage of unusual eels within the order Anguilliformes, and includes families Cyematidae, Monognathidae, Eurypharyngidae, Saccopharyngidae, and the proposed family Neocyematidae. Most of the fish in this group are deep-dwelling and rarely seen, typically known from only a handful of specimens. Species include recognizable fish such as pelican eels (also commonly known as gulper eels) and bobtail eels. Some can live deep in the ocean, well into the aphotic zone, approximately deep. Extensive research has not been conducted on them due to being indirectly observed, with some species known only from their larvae. All families except for the exceptionally rare individuals of proposed family Neoceymatidae (known only from the Atlantic Ocean) are found in all major oceans.

== Description ==
They have multiple internal differences from the rest of Anguilliformes. Notably, they have no symplectic bone, opercular bones, ribs, or swim bladders. Like many other eels, they lack scales and pelvic fins. Their myomeres (muscle segments) are V-shaped instead of W-shaped as in all other fishes, and their lateral lines have no pores, instead being modified to groups of elevated tubules. The jaws are quite large, lined with small teeth, and several types are notable for being able to consume fish larger than themselves. Some species in families Eurypharyngidae and Saccopharyngidae are bioluminescent. 

Like other eels, saccopharyngids have leptocephalus larvae. However, these larvae also have a number of unusual characteristics, such as remarkably deep bodies in the Cyematidae, long lower jaws in the Eurypharyngidae, and unique pigmented swellings at the ends of the gut in Saccopharyngidae and Eurypharyngidae.

The three established families of the suborder Saccopharyngoidei (Eupharyngidae, Monognathidae, Saccopharyngidae) all exhibit sexual dimorphism.

== Taxonomy ==
Until recently, the order &quot;Saccopharyngiformes&quot; was accepted as a separate order from Anguilliformes, based on their distinct morphological differences from the rest of the &quot;true eels&quot;. Genetic work over the past few years has shown that it is instead a derived lineage within the Anguilliformes.

The four (proposed five) families in two suborders are:

* Suborder Cyematoidei
**Cyematidae (bobtail snipe eels)
* Suborder Saccopharyngoidei
**Eurypharyngidae (gulpers)
**Monognathidae (one-jaws)
**Saccopharyngidae (swallowers)
**Neocyematidae (proposed)

<doc id="324132" wikidata="Q595851" url="?curid=324132" title="Registered jack">
<text>A registered jack (RJ) is a standardized telecommunication network interface for connecting voice and data equipment to a computer service provided by a local exchange carrier or long distance carrier. Registered interfaces were first defined in the &quot;Universal Service Ordering Code&quot; (USOC) of the Bell System in the United States for complying with the registration program for customer-supplied telephone equipment mandated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the 1970s. Subsequently, in 1980 they were codified in title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68. Registered jack connections began to see use after their invention in 1973 by Bell Labs.
The specification includes physical construction, wiring, and signal semantics. Accordingly, registered jacks are primarily named by the letters &quot;RJ&quot;, followed by two digits that express the type. Additional letter suffixes indicate minor variations. For example, RJ11, RJ14, and RJ25 are the most commonly used interfaces for telephone connections for one-, two-, and three-line service, respectively. Although these standards are legal definitions in the United States, some interfaces are used worldwide.

The connectors used for registered jack installations are primarily the modular connector and the 50-pin miniature ribbon connector. For example, RJ11 and RJ14 use female six-position modular connectors, and RJ21 uses a 25-pair (50-pin) miniature ribbon connector. RJ11 uses two conductors in a six-position female modular connector, so can be made with any female six-position modular connector, while RJ14 uses four, so can be made with either a 6P4C or a 6P6C connector.

==Naming standard==
The registered jack designations originated in the standardization process of telephone connections in the Bell System in the United States, and describe application circuits and not just the physical geometry of the connectors. The same modular connector type may be used for different registered jack applications. Modular connectors were developed to replace older telephone installation methods that used hardwired cords or bulkier varieties of telephone plugs.

Strictly, &quot;Registered Jack&quot; refers to both the female physical connector (modular connector) and specific wiring patterns, but the term is often used loosely to refer to modular connectors regardless of wiring, gender, or use, commonly for telephone line connections, but also for Ethernet over twisted pair, resulting in confusion over the various connection standards and applications. For example, the six-position physical connector, plug and jack, is identically dimensioned and inter-connectable, whether it is wired for one, two, or three lines. These are the RJ11, RJ14, and RJ25 interfaces. The RJ standards designations only pertain to the wiring of the (female) jacks, hence the name &quot;Registered Jack&quot;. It is commonplace, but not strictly correct, to refer to the unwired connectors or the (male) plugs by these names.

The nomenclature for modular connectors is based on the number of contact positions and the number of contacts present. &quot;6P&quot; indicates a six-position modular plug or jack. A six-position modular plug with conductors in only the middle two positions is designated &quot;6P2C&quot;; 6P4C has four conductors in the middle positions, and 6P6C has all six. An RJ11 without power, if made with a 6P6C connector, has four unused contacts.

==History and authority==
Registration interfaces were created by the Bell System under a Federal Communications Commission order for the standard interconnection between telephone company equipment and customer premises equipment. These interfaces used newly standardized jacks and plugs, primarily based on miniature modular connectors.

The wired communications provider (telephone company) is responsible for delivery of services to a minimum (or main) point of entry (MPOE). The MPOE is a utility box, usually containing surge protective circuitry, which connects the wiring on the customer&#x27;s property to the communication provider&#x27;s network. Customers are responsible for all jacks, wiring, and equipment on their side of the MPOE. The intent was to establish a universal standard for wiring and interfaces, and to separate ownership of in-home (or in-office) telephone wiring from the wiring owned by the service provider.

In the Bell System, following the Communications Act of 1934, the telephone companies owned all telecommunications equipment and they did not allow interconnection of third-party equipment. Telephones were generally hardwired, but may have been installed with Bell System connectors to permit portability. The legal case &quot;Hush-A-Phone v. United States&quot; (1956) and the Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s (FCC) &quot;Carterfone&quot; (1968) decision brought changes to this policy, and required the Bell System to allow some interconnection, culminating in the development of registered interfaces using new types of miniature connectors.

Registered jacks replaced the use of protective couplers provided exclusively by the telephone company. The new modular connectors were much smaller and cheaper to produce than the earlier, bulkier connectors that were used in the Bell System since the 1930s. The Bell System issued specifications for the modular connectors and their wiring as &quot;Universal Service Order Codes&quot; (USOC), which were the only standards at the time. Large customers of telephone services commonly use the USOC to specify the interconnection type and, when necessary, pin assignments, when placing service orders with a network provider.

When the U.S. telephone industry was reformed to foster competition in the 1980s, the connection specifications became federal law, ordered by the FCC and codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 47 CFR Part 68, Subpart F, superseded by T1.TR5-1999.

In January 2001, the FCC delegated responsibility for standardizing connections to the telephone network to a new private industry organization, the Administrative Council for Terminal Attachments (ACTA). For this delegation, the FCC removed Subpart F from the CFR and added Subpart G. The ACTA derives its recommendations for terminal attachments from the standards published by the engineering committees of the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA). ACTA and TIA jointly published the standard TIA/EIA-IS-968, replacing the CFR information.

TIA-968-A, the current version of that standard, details the physical aspects of modular connectors, but not the wiring. Instead, TIA-968-A incorporates the standard T1.TR5-1999, &quot;Network and Customer Installation Interface Connector Wiring Configuration Catalog&quot;, by reference. With the publication of TIA-968-B, the connector descriptions have been moved to TIA-1096-A. A registered jack name, such as RJ11, still identifies both the physical connectors and the wiring (pinout) for each application.

==Types==
The most widely implemented registered jack in telecommunications is the RJ11. This is a modular connector wired for one telephone line, using the center two contacts of six available positions. This configuration is also used for single-line telephones in many countries other than the United States. It may also use a 6P4C connector, to use an additional wire pair for powering lamps on the telephone set. RJ14 is similar to RJ11, but is wired for two lines and RJ25 has three lines. RJ61 is a similar registered jack for four lines, but uses an 8P8C connector.

The RJ45S jack is rarely used in telephone applications, and the &quot;keyed&quot; 8P8C modular plug used for RJ45S &quot;mechanically cannot be inserted into an Ethernet port&quot;, but a similar plug, the &quot;non-keyed&quot; 8P8C modular plug&quot;never used for RJ45S&quot;is used in Ethernet networks, and the connector is often, however improperly, referred to as &quot;RJ45&quot; in this context.
Many of the basic names have suffixes that indicate subtypes:
*C: flush-mount or surface mount
*F: flex-mount
*W: wall-mount
*L: lamp-mount
*S: single-line
*M: multi-line
*X: complex jack

For example, RJ11 comes in two forms: RJ11W is a jack from which a wall telephone can be hung, while RJ11C is a jack designed to have a cord plugged into it. A cord can be plugged into an RJ11W as well.

==RJ11, RJ14, RJ25 wiring ==
All of these registered jacks are described as containing a number of potential contact positions and the actual number of contacts installed within these positions. RJ11, RJ14, and RJ25 all use the same six-position modular connector, thus are physically identical except for the different number of contacts (two, four and six respectively) allowing connections for one, two, or three telephone lines respectively.

Cords connecting to an RJ11 interface require a 6P2C connector. Nevertheless, cords sold as RJ11 often use 6P4C connectors (six position, four conductor) with four wires. Two of the six possible contact positions connect tip and ring, and the other two conductors are unused. RJ11 is commonly used to connect DSL modems to the customer line.

The conductors other than the two central tip and ring conductors are in practice variously used for a second or third telephone line, a ground for selective ringers, low-voltage power for a dial light, or for anti-tinkle circuitry to prevent pulse dialing phones from sounding the bell on other extensions.

===Pinout===
The pins of the 6P6C connector are numbered 1 to 6, counting left to right when holding the connector tab side down with the opening for the cable facing the viewer.

===Provisioning of power===
Some telephones such as the Western Electric Princess and Trimline telephone models require additional power (~6 V AC) for operation of the incandescent dial light. This power is delivered to the telephone set from a transformer by the second wire pair (pins 2 and 5) of the 6P4C connector.

==RJ21==
RJ21 is a registered jack standard using a micro ribbon connector with contacts for up to fifty conductors. It is used to implement connections for up to 25 lines, or circuits that require many wire pairs, such as used in the 1A2 key telephone system. The miniature ribbon connector of this interface is also known as a 50-pin telco connector, CHAMP(AMP), or &quot;Amphenol&quot; connector, the last being a genericized trademark, as Amphenol was a prominent manufacturer of these at one time.

A cable color scheme, known as even-count color code, is determined for 25 pairs of conductors as follows: For each ring, the primary, more prominent color is chosen from the set blue, orange, green, brown, and slate, in that order, and the secondary, thinner stripe color from the set of white, red, black, yellow, and violet colors, in that order. The tip conductor color scheme uses the same colors as the matching ring but switches the thickness of the primary and secondary colored stripes. Since the sets are ordered, an orange (color 2 in its set) with a yellow (color 4) is the color scheme for the 4·5 + 2 − 5 = 17th pair of wires. If the yellow is the more prominent, thicker stripe, then the wire is a tip conductor connecting to the pin numbered 25 + the pair #, which is pin 42 in this case. Ring conductors connect to the same pin number as the pair number.

A conventional enumeration of wire color pairs then begins blue (and white), orange (and white), green (and white) and brown (and white), which subsumes a color-coding convention used in cables of 4 or fewer pairs (8 wires or less) with 8P and 6P connectors.

Dual 50-pin ribbon connectors are often used on punch blocks to create a breakout box for private branch exchange (PBX) and other key telephone systems.
==RJ45S==
The RJ45S, an obsolete standard jack once specified for modem or data interfaces, has a slot on one side to allow mating with a special variation of the 8P plug: a mechanically-keyed plug with an extra tab on one side that prevents it from mating with regular (non-keyed) 8P jacks. The visual difference from the more-common 8P female is subtle. The RJ45S keyed 8P modular connector has only pins 5 and 4 wired for tip and ring (respectively) of a single telephone line, and a &quot;programming&quot; resistor connected to pins 7 and 8.

==RJ48==
RJ48 is used for T1 and ISDN termination, local-area data channels, and subrate digital services. It uses the eight-position modular connector (8P8C).

RJ48C is commonly used for T1 circuits and uses pin numbers 1, 2, 4 and 5.

RJ48X is a variation that contains shorting blocks in the jack for troubleshooting: With no plug inserted, pins 2 and 5 (the two &quot;tip&quot; wires) are connected to each other, and likewise 1 and 4 (&quot;ring&quot;), creating a &quot;loopback&quot; so that a signal received on one pair is returned on the other. Sometimes this is referred to as a &quot;self-looping jack&quot;.

RJ48S is typically used for local-area data channels and subrate digital services and carries one line. It accepts a keyed variety of the 8P modular connector.

RJ48 connectors are fastened to shielded twisted pair (STP) cables, not the unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) commonly used in other installations.
==RJ61==


RJ61 is a physical interface that was often used for terminating twisted pair cables. It uses an eight-position, eight-conductor (8P8C) modular connector.

This wiring pattern is for multi-line analog telephone use only; RJ61 is unsuitable for use with high-speed data because the pins for pairs 3 and 4 are too widely spaced for high signaling frequencies. T1 lines use another wiring for the same connector, designated &quot;RJ48&quot;. Ethernet over twisted pair (10BASE-T, 100BASE-TX and 1000BASE-T) also uses different wiring for the same connector, either T568A or T568B. RJ48, T568A, and T568B are all designed to keep both wires of each pair close together.

The flat eight-conductor silver-satin cable conventionally used with four-line analog telephones and RJ61 jacks is also unsuitable for use with high-speed data. Twisted pair cabling is required for data applications. Twisted-pair patch cable typically used with common Ethernet and other data network standards is not compatible with RJ61, because RJ61 pairs 3 and 4 would each be split across two different twisted pairs in the patch cable, causing excessive cross-talk between voice lines 3 and 4, with conversations on each line literally being audible on the other.

With the advent of structured wiring systems and TIA/EIA-568 (now ANSI/TIA-568) conventions, the RJ61 wiring pattern is falling into disuse. The T568A and T568B standards are used in place of RJ61 so that a single wiring standard in a facility can be used for both voice and data.

==Similar jacks and unofficial names==
The following &quot;RJ&quot;-style names do not refer to official ACTA types.

The labels &quot;RJ9&quot;, &quot;RJ10&quot;, &quot;RJ22&quot; are variously used for 4P4C and 4P2C modular connectors, most typically installed on telephone handsets and their cordage. Telephone handsets do not connect directly to the public network, and therefore have no registered jack designation.

&quot;RJ45&quot; is often incorrectly used when referring to an 8P8C connector used for ANSI/TIA-568 T568A and T568B and Ethernet, however, the plug used for RJ45 is both mechanically and electrically incompatible with any Ethernet port: it cannot fit into an Ethernet port, and it is wired in a way that is incompatible with Ethernet. The connector commonly used for twisted-pair Ethernet is a non-keyed 8P8C connector, quite distinct from that used for RJ45S. The new ARJ45 interface, however, is a plug and jack allowing higher transmission rates, and the jack can, optionally, be backward-compatible with the common 8P8C plugs of Gigabit Ethernet and earlier standards.

&quot;RJ50&quot; is often a 10P10C interface, often used for data applications.

The micro ribbon connector, first made by Amphenol, that is used in the RJ21 interface, has also been used to connect Ethernet ports in bulk from a switch with 50-pin ports to a Cat-5 rated patch panel, or between two patch panels. A cable with a 50-pin connector on one end can support six fully wired 8P8C connectors or Ethernet ports on a patch panel with one spare pair. Alternatively, only the necessary pairs for 10/100 Ethernet can be wired allowing twelve Ethernet ports with a single spare pair.

This connector is also used with spring bail locks for SCSI-1 connections. Some computer printers use a shorter 36-pin version known as a Centronics connector.

The 8P8C modular jack was chosen as a candidate for ISDN systems. In order to be considered, the connector system had to be defined by an international standard, leading to the creation of the ISO 8877 standard. Under the rules of the IEEE 802 standards project, international standards are to be preferred over national standards, so when the original 10BASE-T twisted-pair wiring version of Ethernet was developed, this modular connector was chosen as the basis for IEEE 802.3i-1990.

<doc id="324133" wikidata="Q444694" url="?curid=324133" title="Dumog">
<text>Dumog is the Filipino style of wrestling while standing upright and refers to the grappling aspect of Filipino martial arts. The word &quot;dumog&quot; is most commonly used in Mindanao and the Visayas, while the word &quot;buno&quot; is used in Luzon, specifically in the Southern Tagalog-speaking provinces as far south as Mindoro. Tribal groups such as the Ifugao, Samal, Ibanag, Manobo, Dumagat, and Maranao are said to practice grappling arts known respectively as , , , , , , and ; while ethnic groups such as the Tagalog, Ilokano, Cebuano, Bicolano, Pampanga, and Pangasinan, are said to practice grappling arts known as , , , , , and .

Techniques encompass a variety of pushes, pulls, weight shifts and joint locks designed to &quot;move&quot; the opponent, often taking advantage of their weight and direction of force to throw them off balance. Dumog is based on the concept of &quot;control points&quot; or &quot;choke points&quot; on the human body, which are manipulated – for example: by grabbing, pushing, pulling - in order to disrupt the opponent&#x27;s balance and to keep him off balance. This also creates opportunities for close quarter striking using head butts, knees, forearms and elbows. Dumog also contains methods of joint-locking and choking, as well as takedowns, throws and submission holds. Dumog techniques can be assisted by the environment around you, a wall, lampost or vehicle for example, which helps to immobilise the opponent, or hurt him further by collision with the object. Similarly, Dumog techniques can be used to manipulate an opponent for use as a shield to protect yourself during a multiple attacker scenario, or to quickly move an unwanted person from an area, much like security or law enforcement &quot;come-along&quot; type techniques. Pain compliance is an important aspect of any grappling art. Hence, Dumog techniques can be complemented by nerve point attacks, as well as Kino-mutai which is the term generally used to include pinching, biting, gouging, ripping/tearing methods.

Dumog is taught in most Filipino Martial Arts styles as a small addition to their vast syllabus. However, there are a small handful of FMA based systems such as Harimaw Buno, Apolaki Krav Maga and Dirty Boxing and Garimot Buno whose training focuses on training the art of dumog in much more detail.

== Visayan Dumog ==

Just like the distinct art of Sikaran from Rizal province, the people from the provinces of Antique, Iloilo and Capiz in Panay Island have their own distinct form and traditional sport of &quot;Dumog&quot;. It has been a pastime enjoyed by young and old for generations and its skilled players have consistently been recruited by the Philippine Wrestling Team.

<doc id="324134" wikidata="Q8470763" url="?curid=324134" title="Slide library">
<text>A slide library is a library that houses a collection of photographic slides, either as a part of a larger library or image archive, or standing alone within a larger organization, such as an academic department of a college or university, a museum, or a corporation. Typically, a &quot;slide library&quot; contains slides depicting artwork, architecture, or cultural objects, and is typically used for the study, teaching, and documentation of art history, architectural history, and visual culture. Other academic disciplines, such as biology and other sciences, also maintain image collections akin to slide libraries. Corporations may also have image libraries to maintain and document their publications and history. Increasingly, these types of libraries are known as &quot;Visual Resources Collections,&quot; as they may be responsible for all &quot;visual&quot; materials for the study of a subject and include still and moving images in a variety of physical and virtual formats. They may contain:

* 35mm slides
* lantern slides
* mounted study photographs
* born digital images

Many educational institutions have changed the names of their slide libraries over the years, to a variety of titles like Visual Resources Center, Imaging &amp; AV Center, Digital Collections Center, etc. The titles and duties of slide librarians have therefore expanded greatly. As keepers of these important historical images, visual resources librarians have continuously cataloged and inventoried slide collections, circulated them to faculty for teaching, and more recently, digitized slides and placed them online via content management systems.

== History of visual resources collections ==

The first American lantern slide collections, developed by museums to reflect and augment their collections, got their start between 1860 and 1879: the American Natural History Museum, the New York State Military Museum, the Smithsonian Institution, and the Winterthur Museum. American colleges and universities began their collections during the same period of time: DePauw University, Columbia University, Oberlin College, Princeton University, University of Rochester. Colleges and university collections were used primarily for classroom instruction.

The first illustrated architectural history course west of the Mississippi was John Galen Howard&#x27;s Architecture 5A-F at the University of California, Berkeley in 1905. The six-semester course was required for all architecture students, and like other architectural history courses of its time, at MIT and Cornell University at least, were multi-year in duration. Of course, the lecture was illustrated by lantern slides. In the U.S., lantern slides generally measured 3&quot;x 4.25&quot;.

The 1950s was a period of transition from black and white lantern slides, which heretofore had often been hand colored, to color positive film. Lantern slides were shot directly onto color film, and the 35mm slide (2&quot;x2&quot; with an image of 24mm x 36mm) gained in popularity.

The heyday of the lantern slide lasted one hundred years, more or less, from 1860 to 1960. The reign of the 35mm slide, more or less, was about half as long, fifty years, 1955–2005.

== Timeline: Development of visual resources (collections and profession) in the U.S.==
1865. First lantern slide collections begin developing in the U.S. These 3.25&quot; x 4.0&quot; glass slides projected clearly with great detail. However, projectors required lime light which was dirty and dangerous
1887. First transparent, flexible nitrocellulose film base developed
1888. First perforated film stock developed
1889. Eastman combined nitrocellulose film stock, perforated edges, and dry-gelatino-bromide emulsion to create the first paperless film stock
1902. Court denies Eastman&#x27;s exclusive patent, allowing any company to develop 35mm film

1905. UC Berkeley&#x27;s Architecture Library acquires its first lantern slide, the tree of architecture, made from Banister Fletcher&#x27;s book, &quot;A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method&quot;

1909. 35mm adopted as the international standard gauge by Motion Picture Patents Company, an Edison trust
1913. 35mm film format introduced into still photography
1925. Leica Camera introduced, using 35mm still film
1930. Safety film introduced (cellulose diacetate)
1934–1936. Kodachrome 35mm slide film introduced, but not widely adopted by colleges and universities. Film stock was either flammable or brittle
1949. Kodak replaces all nitrate-based films with its safety film, a cellulose-triacetate base
1952. All camera film is now triacetate based, paving the way for widespread adoption of 35mm film in both amateur and academic markets

1952+ American faculty widely divided in their allegiances to lantern slides for their clarity or to 35mm slides for their ease of production and transport to class. Huge debates begin about whether 35mm color film is stable enough for adoption and whether the loss of clarity will ruin the teaching of art history. Younger faculty adopt 35mm film, while older faculty prefer lantern slides

<doc id="324138" wikidata="Q229990" url="?curid=324138" title="Agnès Varda">
<text>Agnès Varda (; born Arlette Varda; 30 May 1928 – 29 March 2019) was a Belgian-born French film director, screenwriter and photographer.

Varda&#x27;s work employed location shooting in an era when the limitations of sound technology made it easier and more common to film indoors, with constructed sets and painted backdrops of landscapes, rather than outdoors, on location. Her use of non-professional actors was also unconventional for 1950s French cinema. Varda&#x27;s feature film debut was &quot;La Pointe Courte&quot; (1955), followed by &quot;Cléo from 5 to 7&quot; (1962), one of her most notable narrative films, &quot;Vagabond&quot; (1985), and &quot;Kung Fu Master&quot; (1988). Varda was also known for her work as a documentarian with such works as &quot;Black Panthers&quot; (1968), &quot;The Gleaners and I&quot; (2000), &quot;The Beaches of Agnès&quot; (2008), &quot;Faces Places&quot; (2017), and her final film, &quot;Varda by Agnès&quot; (2019).

Director Martin Scorsese described Varda as &quot;one of the Gods of Cinema&quot;. Among several other accolades, Varda received an Honorary Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, becoming the first female director to win the award, a Golden Lion for &quot;Vagabond&quot; at the 1985 Venice Film Festival, an Academy Honorary Award, and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature for &quot;Faces Places&quot;, becoming the oldest person to be nominated for a competitive Oscar. In 2017, she became the first female director to win an honorary Oscar.

==Early life and education ==
Varda was born Arlette Varda on 30 May 1928 in Ixelles, Brussels, Belgium, to Christiane (née Pasquet) and Eugène Jean Varda, an engineer. Her mother was from Sète, France, and her father was a member of a family of Greek refugees from Asia Minor in the Ottoman Empire. She was the third of five children. Varda legally changed her first name to Agnès at age 18. 

She left Belgium with her family in 1940 for Sète, where she spent her teenage years and during World War II, she lived there on a boat with her family. Here started her life-long friendship with the sculptor Valentine Schlegel.

Varda studied art history at the École du Louvre and photography at the , before working as a photographer at the Théâtre National Populaire in Paris. Varda attended the Lycée et collège Victor-Duruy, and received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in literature and psychology from the Sorbonne. She called her relocation to Paris &quot;truly excruciating&quot;, saying it gave her &quot;a frightful memory of my arrival in this grey, inhumane, sad city.&quot; She did not get along with her fellow students and called classes at the Sorbonne &quot;stupid, antiquated, abstract, [and] scandalously unsuited for the lofty needs one had at that age.&quot;

==Photography career==
Varda intended to become a museum curator, and studied art history at the École du Louvre, but decided to study photography at the Vaugirard School of Photography instead. She began her career as a still photographer before becoming one of the major voices of the Left Bank Cinema and the French New Wave. She maintained a fluid interrelationship between photographic and cinematic forms: &quot;I take photographs or I make films. Or I put films in the photos, or photos in the films.&quot;

Varda discussed her beginnings with the medium of still photography: &quot;I started earning a living from photography straight away, taking trivial photographs of families and weddings to make money. But I immediately wanted to make what I called &#x27;compositions.&#x27; And it was with these that I had the impression I was doing something where I was asking questions with composition, form and meaning.&quot; In 1951, her friend Jean Vilar opened the Théâtre National Populaire and hired Varda as its official photographer. Before accepting her position there, she worked as a stage photographer for the Theatre Festival of Avignon. She worked at the Théâtre National Populaire for ten years from 1951 to 1961, during which time her reputation grew and she eventually obtained photo-journalist jobs throughout Europe.

Varda&#x27;s still photography sometimes inspired her subsequent motion pictures. She recounted: &quot;When I made my first film, &quot;La Pointe Courte&quot;without experience, without having been an assistant before, without having gone to film schoolI took photographs of everything I wanted to film, photographs that are almost models for the shots. And I started making films with the sole experience of photography, that&#x27;s to say, where to place the camera, at what distance, with which lens and what lights?&quot;

She later recalled another example:I made a film in 1982 called &quot;Ulysse&quot;, which is based on another photograph I took in 1954, one I&#x27;d made with the same bellows camera, and I started &quot;Ulysse&quot; with the words, &#x27;I used to see the image upside down.&#x27; There&#x27;s an image of a goat on the ground, like a fallen constellation, and that was the origin of the photograph. With those cameras, you&#x27;d frame the image upside down, so I saw Brassaï through the camera with his head at the bottom of the image.

In 2010, Varda joined the gallery Nathalie Obadia.

==Filmmaking career==
Varda&#x27;s filmmaking career predates the French New Wave, but contains many elements specific to that movement. While working as a photographer, Varda became interested in making a film, although she stated that she knew little about the medium and had only seen around 20 films by the age of 25. She later said that she wrote her first screenplay &quot;just the way a person writes his first book. When I&#x27;d finished writing it, I thought to myself: &#x27;I&#x27;d like to shoot that script,&#x27; and so some friends and I formed a cooperative to make it.&quot; She found the filmmaking process difficult because it did not allow the same freedom as writing a novel; she said her approach was instinctive and feminine. In an interview with &quot;The Believer&quot;, Varda said that she wanted to make films that related to her time (in reference to &quot;La Pointe Courte&quot;), rather than focusing on traditions or classical standards.

===&quot;La Pointe Courte&quot; (1954)===

Varda liked photography but was interested in moving into film. After spending a few days filming the small French fishing town of La Pointe Courte for a terminally ill friend who could no longer visit on his own, Varda decided to shoot a feature film of her own, leaving the artistic direction in the hands of her friend Valentine Schlegel. Thus, in 1954, Varda&#x27;s first film, &quot;La Pointe Courte&quot;, about an unhappy couple working through their relationship in a small fishing town, was released. The film is a stylistic precursor to the French New Wave. At the time, Varda was influenced by the philosophy of Gaston Bachelard, under whom she had once studied at the Sorbonne. &quot;She was particularly interested in his theory of &#x27;,&#x27; in which certain personality traits were found to correspond to concrete elements in a kind of psychoanalysis of the material world.&quot; This idea finds expression in &quot;La Pointe Courte&quot; as the characters&#x27; personality traits clash, shown through the opposition of objects such as wood and steel. To further her interest in character abstraction, Varda used two professional actors, Silvia Monfort and Philippe Noiret, combined with the residents of La Pointe Courte, to provide a realistic element that lends itself to a documentary aesthetic inspired by neorealism. Varda continued to use this combination of fictional and documentary elements in her films.

The film was edited by Varda&#x27;s friend and fellow &quot;Left Bank&quot; filmmaker Alain Resnais, who was reluctant to work on it because it was &quot;so nearly the film he wanted to make himself&quot;; Resnais&#x27;s 1959 film &quot;Hiroshima mon amour&quot; would later feature a similar structure. Resnais and Varda remained lifelong friends, though Resnais said they had nothing in common &quot;apart from cats&quot;. The film was immediately praised by &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot;: André Bazin said, &quot;There is a total freedom to the style, which produces the impression, so rare in the cinema, that we are in the presence of a work that obeys only the dreams and desires of its auteur with no other external obligations.&quot; François Truffaut called it &quot;an experimental work, ambitious, honest and intelligent.&quot; Varda said that the film &quot;hit like a cannonball because I was a young woman, since before that, in order to become a director you had to spend years as an assistant.&quot; But the film was a financial failure, and Varda made only short films for the next seven years.

Varda is considered the grandmother and mother of the French New Wave. &quot;La Pointe Courte&quot; is unofficially but widely considered the first film of the movement. It was the first of many she made that focus on issues ordinary people face. Late in her life, she said that she was not interested in accounts of people in power but &quot;much more interested in the rebels, the people who fight for their own life&quot;.

===&quot;Cléo from 5 to 7&quot; (1961)===
After &quot;La Pointe Courte&quot;, Varda made several documentary short films; two were commissioned by the French tourist office. These include one of Varda&#x27;s favorites of her own works, &quot;L&#x27;opéra-mouffe&quot;, a film about the Rue Mouffetard street market which won an award at the 1958 Brussels Experimental Film Festival.

&quot;Cléo from 5 to 7&quot; follows a pop singer through two extraordinary hours in which she awaits the results of a recent biopsy. The film is superficially about a woman coming to terms with her mortality, a common trope for Varda. On a deeper level, &quot;Cléo from 5 to 7&quot; confronts the traditionally objectified woman by giving Cléo her own vision. She cannot be constructed through the gaze of others, which is often represented through a motif of reflections and Cléo&#x27;s ability to strip her body of &quot;to-be-looked-at&quot; attributes (such as clothing or wigs). Stylistically, &quot;Cléo from 5 to 7&quot; mixes documentary and fiction, as had &quot;La Pointe Courte&quot;. The film represents diegetic action said to occur between 5 and 7 p.m., although its run-time is 89 minutes.

=== Daguerréotypes(1976) ===
Daguerréotypes is a 1976 documentary film directed by Agnès Varda, capturing the lives of shopkeepers and residents along Rue Daguerre, a small street in Paris where Varda lived. The film takes its title from both the name of the street and the term &quot;daguerreotype,&quot; reflecting Varda’s fascination with preserving fleeting moments in time. Through a series of intimate vignettes, the documentary explores the routines, stories, and relationships of local bakers, butchers, tailors, and other small business owners. With its static camera work and observational approach, the film offers a heartfelt and authentic portrayal of a community rooted in tradition amidst the evolving urban landscape. Widely regarded as a time capsule of 1970s Paris, Daguerréotypes exemplifies Varda’s ability to find poetry in everyday life and elevate the mundane into something profoundly human.

=== Ciné-Tamaris (1977) ===
In 1977, Varda founded her own production company, Ciné-Tamaris, in order to have more control over shooting and editing. In 2013, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art held Varda&#x27;s first American exhibition, &quot;Agnès Varda in Californialand&quot;. It featured a sculptural installation, several photographs, and short films, and was inspired by time she spent in Los Angeles in the 1960s.

=== &quot;One Sings, the Other Doesn&#x27;t&quot; (1977) === 
Produced by Cine-Tamaris, &quot;L&#x27;une chante, l&#x27;autre pas&quot;—otherwise known as &quot;One Sings, the Other Doesn&#x27;t&quot;—focuses on two women over the span of 14 years during the Women&#x27;s Movement of 1970s France. 22-year-old Suzanne is pregnant with a third child she can not afford. 17-year-old singer Pomme pays for Suzanne to have an abortion. Pomme becomes a pop singer and feminist, forming a group dedicated to women&#x27;s liberation, while Suzanne raises her children and writes about life on the farm. The story follows the two as they live their separate lives but keep in touch throughout the years.

===&quot;Vagabond&quot; (1985)===

In 1985, Varda made &quot;Sans toit ni loi&quot; (&quot;without roof nor law&quot;; known in most English-speaking countries as &quot;Vagabond&quot;), a drama about the death of a young female drifter named Mona. The death is investigated by an unseen and unheard interviewer who focuses on the people who last saw her. &quot;Vagabond&quot; is told through nonlinear techniques, with the film divided into 47 episodes, and each episode about Mona told from a different person&#x27;s perspective. &quot;Vagabond&quot; is considered one of Varda&#x27;s greater feminist works because of how the film deals with the de-fetishization of the female body from the male perspective.

===&quot;Kung-Fu Master!&quot; (1988)===
Kung-Fu Master! is a 1988 French drama film directed by Agnès Varda. The narrative centers on Mary-Jane, a woman in her forties, who becomes romantically involved with Julien, a 14-year-old boy and classmate of her daughter, Lucy. The film delves into themes of unconventional love, societal taboos, and the loneliness of adulthood, offering a nuanced portrayal of complex human emotions. Jane Birkin stars as Mary-Jane, with Mathieu Demy, Varda&#x27;s son, portraying Julien, and Charlotte Gainsbourg as Lucy, adding depth to the familial dynamics explored in the story. The film&#x27;s title references Julien&#x27;s fascination with the arcade game &quot;Kung-Fu Master,&quot; which serves as a recurring motif, symbolizing his youthful escapism and the generational gap between the two protagonists.

Social Commentary:

&quot;Exploration of Isolation and Connection&quot;: Varda uses the controversial relationship between Mary-Jane and Julien to comment on the pervasive loneliness in modern society. Mary-Jane&#x27;s emotional vulnerability highlights how adults often struggle to find meaningful connections, leading them to seek companionship in unexpected and socially fraught circumstances. The film challenges viewers to confront their own biases about love, age, and human needs, pushing the boundaries of societal norms.

&quot;Critique of Gender Expectations&quot;: By portraying Mary-Jane’s relationship with a younger male in a sympathetic yet critical light, Varda draws attention to the double standards in how society judges women’s romantic choices. While male characters in similar scenarios are often romanticized, Kung-Fu Master! provokes a more nuanced discussion about power dynamics, agency, and the societal pressures placed on women to adhere to conventional roles.

Kung-Fu Master! was selected to compete for the Golden Bear at the 38th Berlin International Film Festival, highlighting its critical recognition. Although polarizing due to its subject matter, the film remains a bold exploration of taboo relationships and human vulnerability, cementing Agnès Varda’s reputation as a fearless storyteller who refuses to shy away from difficult questions.

===&quot;Jacquot de Nantes&quot; (1991)===

In 1991, shortly after her husband Jacques Demy&#x27;s death, Varda created the film &quot;Jacquot de Nantes&quot;, which is about his life and death. The film is structured at first as being a recreation of his early life, being obsessed with the various crafts used for filmmaking like animation and set design. But then Varda provides elements of documentary by inserting clips of Demy&#x27;s films as well as footage of him dying. The film continues with Varda&#x27;s common theme of accepting death, but at its heart it is considered to be Varda&#x27;s tribute to her late husband and their work.

===&quot;The Gleaners and I&quot; (2000)===

&quot;Les Glaneurs et la Glaneuse&quot; (&quot;The Gleaners and I&quot;), a documentary, focuses on Varda&#x27;s interactions with gleaners (harvesters) who live in the French countryside, and also includes subjects who create art through recycled material, as well as an interview with psychoanalyst Jean Laplanche. The film is notable for its fragmented and free-form nature along with it being the first time Varda used digital cameras. This style of filmmaking is often interpreted as a statement that great things like art can still be created through scraps, yet modern economies encourage people to only use the finest product.

===&quot;Faces Places&quot; (2017)===
In 2017, Varda co-directed &quot;Faces Places&quot; with the artist JR. The film was screened out of competition at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival where it won the L&#x27;Œil d&#x27;or award. The film follows Varda and JR traveling around rural France, creating portraits of the people they come across. Varda was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature for this film, making her the oldest person to be nominated for a competitive Oscar. Although the nomination was her first, Varda did not regard it as important, stating: &quot;There is nothing to be proud of, but happy. Happy because we make films to love. We make films so that you love the film.&quot; The film ends with Varda and JR knocking on Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s front door in Rolle for an interview. Godard agreed to the meeting but &quot;stands them up&quot;.

=== &quot;Varda by Agnes&quot; (2019)=== 
The last film Varda directed, &quot;Varda by Agnes&quot; features Varda watching and discussing her films and work. She recounts her 60-year artistic journey through photography and filmmaking. She expresses the importance of three key words: inspiration, creation, and sharing. The film shows Varda sitting and reflecting on the things she loves, such as her husband, cats, colors, beaches, and heart-shaped potatoes.
==Style and influences==
Many of Varda&#x27;s films use protagonists that are marginalized or rejected members of society, and are documentary in nature. She made a short film on the Black Panthers after seeing that their leader, Huey Newton, was arrested for killing a police officer. The film focuses on demonstrations in support of Newton and the &quot;Free Huey&quot; campaign.

Like many other French New Wave directors, Varda was likely influenced by auteur theory, creating her own signature style by using the camera &quot;as a pen&quot;. Varda called her method of filmmaking &quot;&quot; (&quot;cinematic writing&quot; or &quot;writing on film&quot;). Rather than separating the fundamental roles that contribute to a film (such as cinematographer, screenwriter, and director), she believed that all roles should work together simultaneously to create a more cohesive film, and all elements of the film should contribute to its message. She claimed to make most of her discoveries while editing, seeking the opportunity to find images or dialogue that create a motif.

Because of her photographic background, still images are often significant in her films. They may serve symbolic or narrative purposes, and each element of them is important. There is sometimes conflict between still and moving images in her films, and she often mixed still images (snapshots) with moving images. Varda paid very close attention to detail and was highly conscious of the implications of each cinematic choice she made. Elements of the film are rarely just functional, each element has its own implications, both on its own and that it lends to the entire film&#x27;s message.

Many of her influences were artistic or literary, including Surrealism, William Faulkner, Franz Kafka, and Nathalie Sarraute.

=== Involvement in the French New Wave ===

Because of her literary influences, and because her work predates the French New Wave, Varda&#x27;s films belong more precisely to the Left Bank (&quot;Rive Gauche&quot;) cinema movement, along with those of Resnais, Chris Marker, Marguerite Duras, Alain Robbe-Grillet, Jean Cayrol and Henri Colpi. Categorically, the Left Bank side of the New Wave movement embraced a more experimental style than the &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot; group, but this distinction is ironic considering that the New Wave itself was considered experimental in its treatment of traditional methodologies and subjects.

Left Bank Cinema was strongly tied to the &quot;nouveau roman&quot; movement in literature. The members of the group had in common a background in documentary filmmaking, left-wing politics, and a heightened interest in experimentation and the treatment of film as art. Varda and other Left Bank filmmakers crafted a mode of filmmaking that blends one of film&#x27;s most socially motivated approaches, documentary, with one of its most formally experimental approaches, the avant-garde. Its members often collaborated with each other. According to scholar Delphine Bénézet, Varda resisted the &quot;norms of representation and diktats of production.&quot;

===As a feminist filmmaker===
Varda&#x27;s work is often considered feminist because of her use of female protagonists and her creation of a female cinematic voice. She said, &quot;I&#x27;m not at all a theoretician of feminism. I did all that—my photos, my craft, my film, my life—on my terms, my own terms, and not to do it like a man.&quot; Although not actively involved in any strict agendas of the feminist movement, Varda often focused on women&#x27;s issues thematically and never tried to change her craft to make it more conventional or masculine. She was also Professor of Film at The European Graduate School.

Bénézet has argued for Varda&#x27;s importance as &quot;a woman of singularity&quot; (), and of the utmost importance in film history. Varda embraced her femininity with distinct boldness.

==Personal life and death==

In 1958, while at a short film festival in Tours, Varda met her future husband, Jacques Demy, also a French director. They moved in together in 1959. She was married to Demy from 1962 until his death in 1990. Varda had two children: a daughter, Rosalie Varda (born 1958), from a previous union with actor Antoine Bourseiller (who starred in &quot;Cléo from 5 to 7&quot;), and a son, Mathieu Demy (born 1972), with Demy. Demy legally adopted Rosalie Varda. Varda worked on the Oscar-nominated documentary &quot;Faces Places&quot; with her daughter.

In 1971, Varda was one of the 343 women who signed the Manifesto of the 343 admitting they had had an abortion despite it being illegal in France at the time and asking that abortion be made legal. That same year, she was one of only four people to attend the funeral of her friend Jim Morrison at Père Lachaise Cemetery. 

Varda was the cousin of the painter Jean Varda. In 1967, while living in California, Varda met her father&#x27;s cousin for the first time. He is the subject of her short documentary &quot;Uncle Yanco&quot;. Jean Varda called himself &quot;Yanco&quot; and was affectionately called &quot;uncle&quot; by Varda due to their age difference.

Varda died from cancer on 29 March 2019 in Paris, at the age of 90. She was buried at Montparnasse Cemetery on 2 April. Among those who attended her funeral were Catherine Deneuve, Julie Gayet, Jean-Pierre Léaud, Jane Birkin, and Sandrine Bonnaire. Mourners left flowers and potatoes outside her house on rue Daguerre.

Her death drew a passionate response from the filmmaking community with Martin Scorsese releasing a statement writing, &quot;I seriously doubt that Agnès Varda ever followed in anyone else&#x27;s footsteps, in any corner of her life or her art. Every single one of her remarkable handmade pictures, so beautifully balanced between documentary and fiction, is like no one else&#x27;s—every image, every cut … What a body of work she left behind: movies big and small, playful and tough, generous and solitary, lyrical and unflinching … and alive.&quot; Barry Jenkins tweeted, &quot;Work and life were undeniably fused for this legend. She lived for every moment of those 90 damn years&quot;. Ava DuVernay wrote about her relationship with Varda, ending her statement with &quot;Merci, Agnes. For your films. For your passion. For your light. It shines on.&quot; Other filmmakers and artists who paid tribute to Varda include Guillermo del Toro, the Safdie brothers, Edgar Wright, JR and Madonna. Jean-Luc Godard sent Varda&#x27;s daughter Rosalie (who produced &quot;Faces Places&quot;) &quot;a kind of photo collage of Agnès ... It was something special. It&#x27;s a secret. But he sent me something nice. I think he cared for Agnès a lot. He saw all her films&quot;, she said.

<text>Joseph Franklin Niekro ( ; November 7, 1944 – October 27, 2006) was an American professional baseball pitcher. During a 22-year baseball career, he pitched from 1967 to 1988 for seven different teams, primarily for the Houston Astros.

He was the younger brother of pitcher Phil Niekro, and the father of former Major League first baseman Lance Niekro. Niekro was born in Martins Ferry, Ohio, and attended Bridgeport High School in Bridgeport, Ohio, and West Liberty University in West Liberty, West Virginia.

==Career==

===Draft and Chicago Cubs===
Niekro was drafted by the Cleveland Indians in the seventh round of the 1966 amateur draft, but he did not sign with the club. On June 7, he was drafted in the third round of the draft by the Chicago Cubs. Niekro went 10–7 in 1967, throwing 169.2 innings while having a 3.34 ERA and 77 strikeouts. Niekro started the following season&#x27;s Opening Day game for the Cubs at Crosley Field against the Cincinnati Reds. He went innings while giving up five runs on six hits in a 9–4 loss. For the year, he went 14–10 while throwing innings on a 4.31 ERA while having 65 strikeouts.

===San Diego Padres===

Niekro was traded along with Gary Ross and Frankie Librán from the Cubs to the expansion San Diego Padres for Dick Selma on April 24, 1969. His combined total for the season was 8–18, throwing 62 strikeouts in innings while having a 3.70 ERA. Along with Al Santorini, he led the Padres in wins with eight.

===Detroit Tigers and Atlanta Braves===

He was traded by the Padres on December 4 to the Detroit Tigers for Dave Campbell and Pat Dobson. In three seasons with Detroit, he went 21–22, having his best season in 1970 by going 12–13, although he had a 4.06 ERA in 213 innings, with a high of 101 strikeouts. He threw 122 innings in the next season and just 47 in the following. He was selected off waivers by the Atlanta Braves on August 7, 1973. Niekro used a fastball and a slider early in his career, with mixed results. In his two seasons with the Braves, he went a combined total of 5–6 while having a 3.76 ERA and 67 innings pitched. During his tenure, he got re-acquainted with the knuckleball that their father taught them. The knuckleball became an essential part of his arsenal though never his sole pitch. Joe threw harder than his brother Phil and could set up batters nearly as effectively with his fastball in combination with his excellent changeup.

===Houston Astros===

The Houston Astros purchased Niekro&#x27;s contract from the Braves for $35,000 in 1975. He blossomed into a dominant pitcher as he perfected his knuckleball in Houston, going 21–11 in 1979 and 20–12 in 1980, to become the first Astros pitcher to win 20 games in consecutive seasons. He also made the National League All-Star team in 1979, a season in which he led the league with his 21 wins and five shutouts, won the &quot;TSN&quot; Pitcher of the Year Award, and ended second in voting for the Cy Young Award behind Bruce Sutter. 1979 also saw the Niekro brothers tie for the wins leader in Major League Baseball, marking this the only year that two brothers shared this statistic.

In 1980, Houston had a three-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West, then lost their last three games of the regular season in Los Angeles, to force a one-game playoff. Niekro allowed six hits in a 7–1 Houston victory that propelled the Astros to their first postseason. He then pitched 10 shutout innings in Game 3 of the NLCS, with the Astros eventually winning 1–0 in the 11th inning, though they lost the series in five games to the Philadelphia Phillies.

Niekro was the Opening Day starter for the Astros to start the 1981 season. It was only the second time in his career as opening-day starting pitcher since doing so as a Cub thirteen years prior. Facing the Dodgers at Dodger Stadium, he went seven innings while allowing two runs on eight hits in the 2–0 loss. He reached the 1,000 strikeout plateau on April 19, doing so on a strikeout bunt by Vance Law. He went 9–9 in 24 games pitched with a 2.82 ERA in 166 innings while striking out 77 batters and walking 47. He appeared in Game 2 of the 1981 National League Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, pitching eight scoreless innings, although Joe Sambito ended up being the winning pitcher for the Astros as they won in the 11th inning, though the Dodgers would win the series in five games. He displayed a bit more effectiveness the following year. He went 17–12 in 35 games with a 2.47 ERA and 270 innings pitched while having a career-high 16 complete games and five shutouts. He struck out a career-high 130 batters while walking 64 and leading all of Major League Baseball with 19 wild pitches.

He was Opening Day starter again for the 1983 season, going just three innings against the Dodgers while allowing six runs on eight hits in a 16–7 loss. He went 15-14 that year, having a 3.48 ERA while starting a league high 38 games and pitching 263.2 innings. His complete games pitched dropped from 16 to nine as he also led the league in wild pitches with 14 and faced a career-high 1,113 batters. He had 152 strikeouts and 101 walks (both higher from the year before). 1984 began with another Opening Day start for Niekro, his fourth and last in a career. He went seven innings but allowed four runs on seven hits in a 4–2 loss to the Montreal Expos. In his penultimate year with the Astros, he went 16–12 with a 3.04 ERA while once again leading all of baseball in games started with 38, pitching innings while striking out 127 batters and walking 89. It was the sixth and final time he faced 1,000 batters.

1985 was a mixed year of benefits and downsides for Niekro. On June 9, he became the all-time winningest pitcher in Astros history, breaking a tie with Larry Dierker (137) by weaving a complete game shut out of the San Francisco Giants at the Astrodome while allowing just two hits. 35 years later, he has held onto the record, as Roy Oswalt fell one win short of tying him for the record. On July 2, he won his 200th career game, throwing a complete game against the San Diego Padres while throwing seven innings and allowing two runs on six hits. Niekro went 9–12 with a 3.72 ERA in 213 innings before being traded.

===New York Yankees===

Niekro was traded to the New York Yankees on September 15 for two players to be named later (Neder Horta and Dody Rather) and Jim Deshaies, where Niekro briefly reunited again with his brother Phil. In his three seasons with New York, he went 14–15 with a 4.58 ERA in 188.2 total innings.

===Minnesota Twins===

He was traded to the Minnesota Twins for Mark Salas on June 7, 1987. He went 4–9 with a 6.26 ERA in innings. That year, he pitched in the World Series, his only appearance in a World Series. In his one appearance in Game 4, he pitched the fifth and sixth innings. He allowed one hit while striking out one and allowing no runs.

Niekro pitched in five games in the 1988 season. He went 1–1 with a 10.03 ERA in 11.2 innings. He was released by the Twins on May 4, 1988. In his final start, he pitched three innings against the Boston Red Sox on April 29, 1988, allowing five runs on six hits in three innings. At the time of his release, Joe and his brother Phil were the leading brother combination in baseball history with 539 victories. Phil had ended his career the previous season.
====Ball-scuffing incident====
While pitching for the Twins earlier in the 1987 season, Niekro was caught ball scuffing. Umpire Tim Tschida told the story in 2021, &quot;Niekro already was a known ball scuffer, of course, and rather than tossing balls out of play, I was putting them in my extra pouch in case we needed evidence. Those balls didn&#x27;t have the normal nick. They had gouges the size of a half-dollar.&quot;

The officiating crew came out to the mound during a game against the California Angels on August 3, 1987. Niekro revealed a nail file in his pocket. When Tschida told Niekro to empty his pockets, Niekro reached into his pockets, pulled out his hands and threw them in the air. An emery board and a piece of sandpaper flew out of his pocket. Steve Palermo was the umpire that spotted the flying objects. Niekro said he was filing his nails in the dugout, but American League president Bobby Brown did not believe him, and ordered the 10-game suspension. Tschida revealed in 2021 that &quot;[Joe] had a hunk of sandpaper trimmed and glued to the palm of his left hand. It was touched up to look like flesh. And when he wanted the extra movement, he would take off the glove and rub the baseball as if he was trying to improve the grip.&quot; Niekro had put his left hand in that pocket, trying to work the sandpaper off his palm.

==Death==
On October 26, 2006, Niekro suffered a brain aneurysm rupture and was taken to South Florida Baptist Hospital in Plant City, Florida. He was later transferred to St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital in Tampa, Florida, where he died the following day at age 61.

==Joe Niekro Foundation==
The Joe Niekro Foundation, created by his daughter Natalie, is committed to supporting patients and families, research, treatment and awareness of brain aneurysms, AVMs, and hemorrhagic strokes. The non-profit organization provides education on the risk factors, causes, and treatment of these conditions, while funding the advancement of neurological research.

==Statistics and records==
* His 221 career wins make him one of the most successful knuckleball pitchers of all time. The Niekro brothers combined for 539 total wins, setting the major league record for the most wins by a pair of brothers.
* On May 29, 1976, Niekro hit the only big league home run of his career (973 lifetime at bats), and it came off his brother Phil.
* In the 1987 World Series with Minnesota, Niekro set a record for the longest period of time between a major league debut and a first appearance in the Series.
* On July 2, 1970, while with the Tigers, Niekro had a no-hitter broken up with one out in the ninth by a Horace Clarke single; this would be the only hit Niekro allowed in defeating the New York Yankees, 5–0. With his brother Phil pitching a no-hitter in 1973, the Niekros would have been the first brothers to pitch Major League no-hitters. (The Forsch brothers would eventually become the first, and the only ones as of 2014, to have that distinction, Bob pitching two, in 1978 and 1983, and Ken in 1979.)

==Legacy==
* He appeared on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; on August 15, 1987, wearing a carpenter&#x27;s apron and carrying a power sander, while serving a suspension for having a nail file on the mound.
* The Minnesota Twins released a bobblehead set of the 1987 World Series team; Niekro&#x27;s included a nail file in his back pocket.
* In 1992, Joe Niekro was inducted into the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame.
*Joe Niekro&#x27;s son JJ was signed by the Atlanta Braves as an undrafted free agent after the 2021 Major League Baseball draft.

<text>Mija Martina Barbarić (born 26 April 1984) is a Bosnian Croat singer and TV host from Bosnia and Herzegovina who used to work as a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Tourism and Environment of Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

She represented Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Eurovision Song Contest 2003 with the song &quot;Ne brini&quot;. She also provided the results of the Bosnia and Herzegovina televote in the Eurovision Song Contest 2004.

<text>World War II combatives encompass a diverse range of combat techniques designed for close-quarters combat scenarios. These techniques include hand-to-hand fighting, advanced firearm point shooting methods, and skills with various weapons, such as knives, bayonets, and improvised implements. These techniques were initially developed and taught to Allied special forces during World War II by prominent instructors, including Rex Applegate and William Ewart Fairbairn.

==Historical Background==
The origins of World War II combatives can be traced back to the policing tactics employed by law enforcement forces in the Shanghai International Settlement. This period saw the pioneering of concepts akin to modern-day SWAT (Special Weapons and Tactics) units. These specialized police units operated in Shanghai, which was widely regarded as one of the most dangerous port cities in the world during that era.

==World War II application==

With the outbreak of World War II, veterans of the Shanghai Municipal Police played a crucial role in training various Allied military units. These units included renowned elite forces such as the British Commandos, the Special Air Service (SAS), and the Special Boat Service (SBS), as well as the US and Canadian 1st Special Service Force, commonly known as the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Brigade.&quot; Additionally, these techniques were taught to intelligence personnel within organizations like the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which served as the precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The British Special Operation Executive, Marine Raider Units, and the US Army Rangers were among the many other military groups that received training in World War II combatives.

==Related concepts and techniques==

Notable combat systems and martial arts techniques related to World War II combatives include Defendu, Defendo, Kapap, Krav Maga, and Sambo. These martial disciplines share commonalities with World War II combatives, emphasizing practical and effective methods for self-defense and close-quarters combat.

<text>Sir Malcolm Henry Arnold (21 October 1921 – 23 September 2006) was an English composer. His works feature music in many genres, including a cycle of nine symphonies, numerous concertos, concert works, chamber music, choral music and music for brass band and wind band. His style is tonal and rejoices in lively rhythms, brilliant orchestration, and an unabashed tunefulness. He wrote extensively for the theatre, with five ballets specially commissioned by the Royal Ballet, as well as two operas and a musical. He also produced scores for more than a hundred films, among these &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; (1957), for which he won an Oscar.

==Early life==
Malcolm Arnold was born in Northampton, Northamptonshire, England, the youngest of five children from a prosperous Northampton family of shoemakers. Although shoemakers, his family was full of musicians; both of his parents were pianists, and his aunt was a violinist. His great great grandfather was the composer William Hawes, a choirmaster at the Chapel Royal. After seeing Louis Armstrong play in Bournemouth, he took up the trumpet at the age of 12, and five years later won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music (R.C.M.).

At the RCM he studied composition with Gordon Jacob and the trumpet with Ernest Hall. In 1941, he joined the London Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO) as second trumpet and became principal trumpet in 1943.

In 1941 he registered as a conscientious objector, and was initially exempted from military service conditional upon joining the National Fire Service, but in the event he was allowed to continue in the LPO. In 1944, after his brother in the Royal Air Force had been killed, he volunteered for military service. When the army put him in a military band he shot himself in the foot to get back to civilian life; he remained in touch with the CO movement, giving a trumpet recital at the 1946 New Year party of the Central Board for Conscientious Objectors. After a season as principal trumpet with the BBC Symphony Orchestra, he returned in 1946 to the London Philharmonic, where he remained until 1948, leaving to become a full-time composer.

==Career==
Arnold began his career playing trumpet professionally, but by the age of 30 his life was devoted to composition. He was ranked with Benjamin Britten as one of the most sought-after composers in Britain. His natural melodic gift earned him a reputation as a composer of light music in works such as some of his concert overtures and the sets of Welsh, English, Four Scottish Dances, Irish and Cornish dances.

He was also a highly successful composer of film music, penning the scores to over a hundred features and documentaries, including titles such as &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;, &quot;Hobson&#x27;s Choice&quot; and the St Trinian&#x27;s series. His nine symphonies are often deeply personal and show a more serious side to his work, which has proved more controversial; his final symphony, for example, is so bleak in mood and sparse in orchestration that it was not publicly performed until six years after its composition. Arnold also wrote a variety of concertos and chamber works, as well as music for the theatre including major ballets.

==Later years and death==
By 1961, Arnold had a reputation for being unpleasant, frequently drunk and highly promiscuous. He divorced his first wife in that year. His second wife took out a court order after they separated. After their divorce, he made two suicide attempts.

His later years saw a decline in both his health and his finances. In 1978, he was treated as an in-patient for several months in the acute psychiatric ward at the Royal Free Hospital, Pond Street, London, and in 1979 he entered St Andrew&#x27;s Hospital in his hometown of Northampton to be treated for depression and alcoholism. 

Between 1979 and 1986 he was formally in the care of the Court of Protection. However despite this, and being given only a year to live in the early 1980s, he recovered and lived for 22 more years, albeit with a carer, Anthony Day. In this period he completed his Ninth and final symphony in 1986. 

By the time of his 70th birthday in 1991 his artistic reputation with the general public was recovering and he was even able to enjoy a triumphant appearance on the stage of the Royal Albert Hall to receive an ovation after a Proms performance of his Guitar Concerto.

Arnold died at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, Norwich, on 23 September 2006, aged 84, after suffering from a chest infection. That same day his last work, &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, was premiered in a Northern Ballet production at the Bradford Alhambra. (The score included no new music by Arnold, but excerpts from various of his compositions were arranged by John Longstaff. The original score was compiled by Anthony Meredith.)

A dispute was fought out between Day and members of Arnold&#x27;s family over the royalties of Arnold&#x27;s Ninth Symphony. Day was granted rights, having been left a substantial part of Arnold&#x27;s estate.

==Music==

Arnold was a relatively conservative composer of tonal works, but a prolific and popular one. He acknowledged Hector Berlioz as an influence, alongside Gustav Mahler, Béla Bartók and jazz. Several commentators have drawn a comparison with Jean Sibelius. Arnold&#x27;s most significant works are sometimes considered to be his nine symphonies. He also wrote a number of concertos, including one for guitar for Julian Bream, one for cello for Julian Lloyd Webber, two for clarinet for Frederick Thurston and Benny Goodman, one for harmonica for Larry Adler and one – enthusiastically welcomed at its premiere during the 1969 Proms – for three hands on two pianos for the husband-and-wife team of Cyril Smith and Phyllis Sellick. His sets of dances – comprising two sets of &quot;English Dances&quot; (Opp. 27 and 33), along with one set each of &quot;Scottish Dances&quot; (Op. 59), &quot;Cornish Dances&quot; (Op. 91), &quot;Irish Dances&quot; (Op. 126), and &quot;Welsh Dances&quot; (Op. 138) — are mainly in a lighter vein and are popular both in their original orchestral guise and in later wind and brass band arrangements. The &quot;English Dances&quot; also form the basis for Kenneth MacMillan&#x27;s short ballet &quot;Solitaire&quot;, and one of them has been used as the theme music for the British television programme &quot;What the Papers Say&quot; (the &quot;Cornish Dances&quot; has provided the theme music for the television programmes of the cook Rick Stein). Arnold also wrote some highly successful concert overtures, including &quot;Beckus the Dandipratt&quot; (an important stepping stone in his early career), the strikingly scored &quot;Tam o&#x27; Shanter&quot; (based on the famous Robert Burns poem), the rollicking &quot;A Grand Grand Overture&quot; (written for a Hoffnung Festival and featuring three vacuum cleaners and a floor polisher, all in turn polished off by a firing squad in a mock &quot;1812&quot; manner), and the dramatic &quot;Peterloo Overture&quot; (commissioned by the Trades Union Congress to commemorate the historic massacre of protesting workers in Manchester). Another popular short work is his Divertimento for Flute, Oboe and Clarinet (Op. 37). Arnold is also known for his relatively large number of compositions and arrangements of his own compositions for brass band. In 1954, &quot;Beckus the Dandipratt&quot; was given a radio studio performance by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Leopold Stokowski, who was thanked by the composer for his &quot;wonderful performance.&quot;

===Film scores===
A successful composer for the cinema, Malcolm Arnold was credited with having written over a hundred film scores for features and documentaries between 1947 and 1969. In 1957, Arnold won an Academy Award for the music to David Lean&#x27;s film &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;. His two other collaborations with David Lean were &quot;The Sound Barrier&quot; (1952) and &quot;Hobson&#x27;s Choice&quot; (1954). &quot;The Inn of the Sixth Happiness&quot; (1958) won Arnold an Ivor Novello Award. Also during the 1950s – an especially prolific period for Arnold – he provided a series of scores for major British and American feature films, such as &quot;The Captain&#x27;s Paradise&quot; (1953), &quot;The Sea Shall Not Have Them&quot; (1954), &quot;The Night My Number Came Up&quot; (1955), &quot;The Constant Husband&quot; (1955), &quot;I Am a Camera&quot; (1955), &quot;1984&quot; (1956), &quot;Trapeze&quot; (1956), &quot;A Hill in Korea&quot; (1956), &quot;Dunkirk&quot; (1958), &quot;The Key&quot; (1958) and &quot;The Roots of Heaven&quot; (1958). He also wrote the music for the entire series of St Trinian&#x27;s films, including &quot;The Belles of St Trinian&#x27;s&quot; (1954), which was a particular favourite with the composer. The films&#x27; introductory theme has echoes of &quot;Lili Marleen&quot;, the iconic wartime song. His 1960s scores included &quot;The Angry Silence&quot; (1960), &quot;Tunes of Glory&quot; (1960), &quot;No Love for Johnnie&quot; (1961), &quot;Whistle Down the Wind&quot; (1961), &quot;The Inspector&quot; (1962), &quot;The Lion&quot; (1962), &quot;Nine Hours to Rama&quot; (1963), &quot;Tamahine&quot; (1963), &quot;The Chalk Garden&quot; (1964), &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; (1964), &quot;Sky West and Crooked&quot; (1965), &quot;The Heroes of Telemark&quot; (1965), &quot;Africa Texas Style&quot; (1967) and &quot;The Reckoning&quot; (1970). His last film score was for the movie &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1969).

==Legacy==
He was the President of the Rochdale Youth Orchestra until his death in September 2006. The Leicestershire Schools Symphony Orchestra made the first commercial recording of Arnold&#x27;s &quot;Divertimento&quot; for the Pye label in July 1967 and regularly performed many of his works in the UK and abroad.

Arnold also conducted the orchestra in a 1963 De Montfort Hall concert that included his own &quot;English Dances&quot; and &quot;Tam O&#x27;Shanter&quot;. Malcolm Arnold wrote the &quot;Trevelyan Suite&quot; to mark the opening of Trevelyan College, University of Durham. His daughter was among the first intake of students. He conducted the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in the live Royal Albert Hall recording of Jon Lord&#x27;s &quot;Concerto for Group and Orchestra&quot; with Deep Purple in September, 1969. 

The following year he conducted the premiere of Lord&#x27;s &quot;Gemini Suite&quot; with Deep Purple and the Light Music Society at the Royal Festival Hall and in 1971 conducted the London Symphony Orchestra in the studio recording of &quot;Gemini Suite&quot; with various rock soloists.

Since the 1980s there have been frequent concerts and festivals dedicated to his music. In October of each year there is a Malcolm Arnold Festival in his birthplace Northampton, currently directed by the chairman of the Malcolm Arnold Society, Paul Harris. On 3 September 2010 the Malcolm Arnold Academy, a secondary school in Northampton, was opened; while in September 2014 the new Malcolm Arnold Preparatory Free School was opened.

, the fate of an archive of material relating to the period between 1979 and 1986, when Arnold was in the care of the Court of Protection, is in question. Because the archive contains personal information, its current holders, the Ministry of Justice, have always refused access to it and wish to destroy it. Arnold&#x27;s daughter, Katherine Arnold, and others have appealed for it to be retained and transferred to the National Archives. In a written answer to John Hayes MP on 17 November 2020, John Whittingdale, Minister of State at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, stated that the fate of the records was under discussion between the Ministry of Justice, the National Archives and the Court of Protection, and that they were &quot;not at imminent risk of destruction.&quot;

<text>Forest Hill is a neighbourhood and former village in Midtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada, located north of Downtown Toronto. The village was amalgamated into Toronto in 1967 and the area has retained its name as a neighbourhood. Along with other neighbourhoods such as Rosedale and The Bridle Path, it is one of Toronto&#x27;s wealthiest neighbourhoods, with an average income, among income recipients 15 or older in private households, of $157,600 in Forest Hill South and $89,700 in Forest Hill North, compared to the $59,250 average income in Toronto&#x27;s Census Metropolitan Area and $54,450 in Canada as a whole.

==History==
Forest Hill was originally incorporated as a village in 1923, and later amalgamated by the province into the City of Toronto in 1967, along with the Village of Swansea. The village was named after the summer home of John Wickson, the father of Toronto architect Frank Wickson; previously, it had been known as Spadina Heights (a name that continued to be applied to the neighbourhood into the twentieth century). Spadina Heights is a derivative of the First Nations (namely Ojibwe) word &quot;ishapadenah&quot;, meaning a hill or sudden rise in land. Rather than electing a mayor as in a city, the leading municipal official was the reeve of the village.

In the late 1960s, the City of Toronto planned to construct a highway that would run from Highway 401 to downtown Toronto via the Cedarvale Ravine and Spadina Road. Forest Hill and the Annex would be bisected by the proposed route, and numerous local houses would be sacrificed for the new expressway. This prompted local residents to rise to protest and raise the awareness of the greater public. The provincial government was forced to withdraw its support for the so-called Spadina Expressway in 1971.

The Forest Hill War Memorial was erected by Page and Steele Architects at Eglinton Avenue and Vesta Road in 1980, in memory of those who lost their lives in the First and Second World Wars.

When the Village was amalgamated into the City of Toronto, the agreement granted local residents the right to have their garbage picked up from their doorstep rather than from the curb. It wasn&#x27;t until 1993 that the public learned that this extra service cost $420,000 a year and was paid for by the municipal government. This time, the public opinion of other Torontonians forced the city to discontinue this favour to Forest Hill residents.

The neighbourhood&#x27;s original boundaries were Bathurst Street to the west, Upper Canada College to the east, Eglinton Avenue to the north, and Lonsdale Road and a portion of Montclair Avenue to the south (the original boundaries of School Section 30). Neighbourhoods north of Eglinton are sometimes though not unanimously regarded as Forest Hill. In 1999 Robert Fulford compared Forest Hill to Rosedale, the other traditional home of Toronto&#x27;s elite: &quot;While Rosedale has remained stable for half a century, Forest Hill&#x27;s prestige has been growing steadily. There&#x27;s a key tonal difference in the architecture of the two places: where big Rosedale houses shout &#x27;history,&#x27; big Forest Hill houses shout &#x27;grandeur.&#x27; More than any other district in the central city, Forest Hill has become the site of spectacular new &#x27;neo-traditional&#x27; homes built on a grand scale, usually with lawns to match.&quot;

==Location==
Currently, for the purposes of social policy analysis &amp; research, the city of Toronto&#x27;s Social Development, Finance &amp; Administration division divides Forest Hill into two neighbourhoods: Forest Hill North and Forest Hill South.

Forest Hill Village is the commercial part of Forest Hill, a short block along Spadina Road, on either side of Lonsdale. Forest Hill extends roughly from Briar Hill Avenue in the north (the Upper Village, officially part of Forest Hill North) to Heath Street in the south (the Lower Village, officially the major part of Forest Hill South along Spadina Road between Bathurst Street/Cedarvale Ravine (whichever is further east) and Avenue Road. The designations &quot;Upper&quot; and &quot;Lower&quot; are based on height of land and not on positions on a map or along a watercourse.

Forest Hill Village was completely developed by the 1930s and is known for its upscale shopping and dining, although the actual mix of stores includes several modest enterprises. Forest Hill Village has attracted extensive residential development (especially of apartments), both within the original boundaries of Forest Hill and in adjacent neighbourhoods to which developers have now extended the Village and Forest Hill names.

The Upper Village was slower to develop because it had previously been occupied by the old Belt Line Railway, and then by industry. Its houses were built mostly in the 1940s and 50&#x27;s. Many homes have been, or are being significantly renovated, with some being torn down completely to make way for monster &#x27;neo-classical&#x27; homes.

Forest Hill North extends from Briar Hill Avenue in the north to Eglinton Avenue West in the south, and from Latimer Avenue in the east to Allen Road and Marlee Avenue in the north-west and south-west, respectively. For administrative purposes, Forest Hill North is Toronto neighbourhood #102.

As the name would imply, Forest Hill South (designated as Toronto neighbourhood #101) is directly south of Forest Hill North. It extends from Eglinton Ave West in the north to Tichester Road in the south, and from Bathurst Street in the west to Elmsthorpe Road in the northeast and Avenue Road and the Oriole Parkway in the east. There is an additional stretch of Forest Hill South between Bathurst Street and Spadina Road, north of Lonsdale Road. South Hill borders Forest Hill South to the south.

For administrative purposes, Forest Hill North is Toronto neighbourhood #102. Politically, the residents of Forest Hill North are represented either in the Eglinton-Lawrence ward or in the St. Paul&#x27;s (west) ward. Meanwhile, Forest Hill South is neighbourhood #101. Similarly, the residents of Forest Hill South are represented in either the St. Paul&#x27;s (west) ward or the St. Paul&#x27;s (east) ward.

==Character==
Like many neighbourhoods found within Toronto, there is always a correlation between districts as well as nodes. In other words, where there are nodes, then there most likely will be a district. In further depth, a node can be defined as strategic foci into which the observer can enter, typically either through junctions of paths, or concentrations of some characteristic. On the other hand, districts can be defined as areas that have some common character. They can be recognized internally, and occasionally be used as a reference point. In the case of Forest Hill, this is one primary characteristic of the neighbourhood. 
Unlike many neighbourhoods, where interaction of people and the overall community is spread throughout, such as Riverdale, Forest Hill is unique in that a lot of its interaction is observable in clusters (most noticeably around nodes).

The notable nodes found in the neighbourhood include the intersection of Lonsdale and Spadina Road, St Clair Ave West and Bathurst Street, as well as Eglinton Ave West and Bathurst Street. In further analysis, the node of Lonsdale and Spadina Road is enhanced with the cluster of small independently owned stores and various services such as banking, fitness, etc. Similarly, the intersection of Eglinton Ave West and Bathurst Street is strengthened with high end retail shops. Finally, the node of Bathurst Street and St Clair Ave West is further reinforced with the establishment of a Loblaws as well as the accessibility to the subway, St Clair West Station.

Subsequently, these nodes have led to the development of many well known districts within the area, such as Forest Hill Village, located in the intersection between Lonsdale and Spadina Road. Secondly, the commercial strip line on Eglinton Ave West, as a product of the Eglinton Ave West – Bathurst Street intersection. Lastly, the development of low-rise apartments district found along the corner of Bathurst Street and St Clair Ave West. Ultimately, beyond these clusters of interaction, Forest Hill is a quiet residential area.

===Housing===
Characteristics of housing as well as streetscapes are dominant in providing the outsider a simple yet strong image of the Forest Hill neighbourhood. In other words, neighbourhoods in Toronto are sometimes characterized by their housing types and/or streetscape. For instance, the Leaside neighbourhood is noted for its many trees or the Rosedale neighbourhood being noted for distinct and large lot housing.

Throughout Forest Hill, the conventional suburbs housing style (without the aspect of homogeneous households), makes up the majority of the area. In simplicity, Forest Hill housing has dominant traits of the conventional suburbs housing type. In further analysis, characteristics of low density, large lots (being car-oriented), as well as having segregated land uses are all evident in the neighbourhood.

A significant amount of the residential housing is based on the conventional suburbs type. However, its characteristics of singularity make it distinct from housing in other parts of Toronto. In other words, houses, schools, places of worship and other building types are all architecturally built with different styles. Each building is distinct from one another. For instance, the town houses located in the East York neighbourhood or the semi detached housing in Davisville, are more or less homogeneous in design compared to the housing style of Forest Hill.

The Upper Village is dominated by Tudor and Georgian styles, but the architectural styles range from French Colonial with terra cotta tiles to English country manors with sweeping lawns. Luxurious details such as sculpture gardens, porte-cochères, and imposing gated entrances are quite widespread. For example, Old Forest Hill Road hosts &quot;a style of domestic architecture that&#x27;s often been described as Stockbroker Baronial&quot;. Forest Hill also contains a fair number of luxury condominium buildings located west of Spadina on Lonsdale Road.

In 2007, the average sale price for a Forest Hill South home was $4,320,000, although renting a place in the neighbourhood was still relatively affordable as of 2011. Like much of Toronto today, that is no longer the case. 

The density in Forest Hill is fairly low as composed of mainly low-density housing. The housing is predominantly detached houses with several semi-detached and town homes. Although it is mainly low-density housing, the lots are not as large as the ones found in suburban Richmond Hill. Forest Hill detached homes are mostly on smaller lots with houses closer to each other. Higher-density and mixed uses are found at the major roads and nodes of the neighbourhood mainly on Eglinton Ave, St Clair West and Spadina Ave. At those major roads, it is the only place we see different uses other than residential. here are grocery stores, convenient stores, coffee shops and offices in those areas.

===Streetscape===

Several elements that contribute to the unique character of the area are its sidewalks and local roads, as well as landscaping and natural environment. A majority of the area does not have sidewalks. Streets are often very wide within the residential interior of the neighbourhood. Additionally, the streets of the area are littered with many stop signs as well as a fair number of speed bumps.

Along with sidewalks and streets, landscaping and the natural surroundings are also a large part of the character of the neighbourhood. First and foremost, landscaping is frequent at many homes. More often than not, properties have unusual trees and plants as well as intricate designed pieces of foliage that run along the front, sides as well as back of the houses. Further, simple yards are also well maintained at most homes. Overall, explicit landscaping and good maintenance of yards are indicators of economic status and with regards to Forest Hill. It reinforces the idea of a neighbourhood with higher incomes.

St. Clair Avenue West is the major east-west road to the south of the village and it is lined with commercial and retail buildings. Spadina Road has a variety of uses ranging from coffee shops, fitness and independent retail stores along the road. Spadina Road is the only transit route running through the neighbourhood, while St. Clair Avenue has a streetcar line connecting to the Yonge-University_Spadina subway. Notable landmarks and structures in Forest Hill include Eglinton Theatre, Grace Church on-the-Hill, and Timothy Eaton Memorial Church.

===Jewish community===
Wealthy Jews began moving into the village in the 1930s. Holy Blossom Temple relocated to 1950 Bathurst Street in 1938, just outside the boundaries of Forest Hill, as a majority of its &quot;uptown&quot; membership had moved north of St. Clair Avenue. By 1941, Forest Hill village had 1,295 Jewish residents (11% of the population). With the mass suburbanization of the Toronto Jewish community after 1945, the Jewish population of Forest Hill grew to 11,000 by 1961. Forest Hill has a number of businesses catering to the Jewish community along Eglinton Avenue West. The 2021 census figures show 8,925 people who gave their religion as Jewish, 38.5% of the total; in answer to the census question about cultural or ethnic origin, 5,125 said Jewish, which is 22.1% of the total (these figures are for Forest Hill North and Forest Hill South combined, as compiled and published by the City of Toronto).

=== Federally and Provincially ===

Forest Hill tends to support the Conservative Party of Canada federally and the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario provincially. Home to a large population of affluent Jews, it has gravitated to the Conservatives due to their support for Israel; both the Liberals&#x27; capital gains reform and response to the war in Gaza were considered contributing factors to their loss in the 2024 Toronto—St. Paul&#x27;s byelection, a riding which much of Forest Hill lies in.

<text>In British politics, Blairism is the political ideology of Tony Blair, the former leader of the Labour Party and Prime Minister between 1997 and 2007, and those that support him, known as Blairites. It entered the &quot;New Penguin English Dictionary&quot; in 2000. Elements of the ideology include investment in public services, expansionary efforts in education to encourage social mobility, and increased actions in terms of mass surveillance alongside a ramping up of law enforcement powers, both of these latter changes advocated in the context of fighting organized crime and terrorism. Blairites have additionally been known for their contrast with the traditional support for socialism by those believing in left-wing politics, with Blair himself and others speaking out against the nationalisation of major industries and against also heavy regulations of business operations. On foreign policy, Blairism is supportive of close relations with the United States and liberal interventionism, including advocacy for both the Iraq war and the War in Afghanistan (2001–2021).

==Ideology==

Politically, Blair has been identified with record investment into public services, an interventionist and Atlanticist foreign policy, support for stronger law enforcement powers, a large focus on surveillance as a means to address terrorism and a large focus on education as a means to encourage social mobility. In the early years (circa 1994–1997), Blairism was also associated with support for European integration and particularly British participation in the European single currency, though this waned after Labour took office.

The term is used in particular in contrast to Brownite, to identify those within the Labour Party who supported Gordon Brown rather than Blair. However, with Blair and Brown typically in agreement on most political issues (from Iraq to public sector reform), some commentators have noted that &quot;the difference between Brownites and Blairites [...] is more tribal than ideological&quot;. This is believed to stem from a personal disagreement between Blair and Brown over who should run for the leadership following the death of John Smith in 1994. Though Brown was originally considered the senior of the two, he waited until after Smith&#x27;s funeral to begin campaigning, by which point Blair had gathered too much momentum to be defeated. However, in his book &quot;Whatever it Takes&quot;, Steve Richards offered an alternate view: that there were significant disagreements between the two about relative poverty, the level of public spending and the potential for choice in public services.

In a 1999 article, &quot;The Economist&quot; stated: 

Blair&#x27;s tenure is known for an expansion of LGBT rights, such as the introduction of civil partnerships. Blair told the LGBT organisation Stonewall that &quot;what has happened is that the culture of the country has changed in a definable way&quot; and that &quot;it&#x27;s a thing that doesn&#x27;t just give me a lot of pride, but it has actually brought a lot of joy&quot;. Blair has also stated that he got up off his seat and danced upon seeing the first civil partnership ceremonies on television.

==Relationship to prior administrations==

&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; stated in April 2008 that Blair&#x27;s programme, with its emphasis on &quot;New Labour&quot;, accepted the free-market ideology of Thatcherism. The article cited deregulation, privatisation of key national industries, maintaining a flexible labour market, marginalising the role of trade unions and devolving government decision making to local authorities as evidence. He also sought a closer, better relationship with Europe, and considered joining the Euro currency, but Gordon Brown was not in favour.

In the BBC Four documentary film &quot;Tory! Tory! Tory!&quot;, Blair is described as personally admiring Margaret Thatcher deeply and making the decision that she would be the first outside person he formally invited to visit him in 10 Downing Street.

Former Conservative Prime Minister John Major, who Blair defeated in a landslide at the 1997 general election; was one of the original figures behind the Northern Ireland peace process that Blair continued and both of them campaigned together in support of the Good Friday Agreement.

Blair privately called Thatcher &quot;unhinged&quot;, a description that later became public knowledge. Blair criticised the Thatcher government&#x27;s record on poverty and made that a key issue for Labour economic policy. He made the goal to eradicate child poverty in Britain within 20 years based on the fact that one-third of British children were in poverty post-Thatcher compared to the 9% rate in 1979 (although these statistics are disputed).

In a 2001 speech to a Conservative election rally, Thatcher called New Labour &#x27;rootless and soulless&#x27; saying at least Old Labour stood for certain principles, that respected them, and also said Blair does not truly believe in liberty. She also claimed the Labour government would give up the British pound to join the Euro.

Blair also abolished Section 28 and created more pro-European initiatives compared to Thatcher.

In his 2010 autobiography, &quot;A Journey&quot;, Blair remarked: 

==Relationship to later administrations==

== Impact on the Labour Party ==
The Labour Party leadership of Jeremy Corbyn was seen as a departure from Blairism, and a return of Old Labour, and was described as a &#x27;return of the 1940s Labour Party&#x27; by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, with its emphasis on re-nationalisation of energy, water, and railways and massive public investment in housing and the NHS. Jeremy Corbyn was critical of Blair&#x27;s involvement in Iraq and voted against it at the time, garnering much support particularly from the youth vote. Labour increased its vote share by over 9% in 2017, costing Theresa May her majority in Parliament, but with the party split by Brexit policy and identitarian infighting, it lost the 2019 election to Boris Johnson&#x27;s Conservatives.

Since the election of Keir Starmer as Leader of the Labour Party in 2020, some in the British media have noted the ideological shift from the left back to the centre, allowing comparisons to be drawn between the current policy platform of the Labour Party and its Shadow Ministers (some of whom served in the cabinets of Blair and Brown) and that of New Labour.

The November 2021 shadow cabinet reshuffle was seen to be giving more power to Blairites in the Parliamentary Labour Party. This was criticised by former Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer John McDonnell. In May 2022, on the 25th anniversary of Labour&#x27;s landslide victory in the 1997 election, Blair in a video looked back at the victory and his achievements and showed his support for Starmer.

The 2023 British shadow cabinet reshuffle was seen as giving even more power to Blairites within the Labour Party.

<text>The Ampsivarii, sometimes referenced by modern writers as Ampsivari (a simplification not warranted by the sources), were a Germanic tribe mentioned by ancient authors.

Their homeland was originally around the middle of the river Ems, which flows into the North Sea at the Dutch-German border. Most likely they lived between the Bructeri &quot;minores&quot; (located at the delta of the river IJssel) and the Bructeri &quot;maiores&quot;, who were living south of them on the upper Ems. It is supposed that their name is a Latin rendering of the Germanic &quot;Ems-werer&quot;, meaning &quot;men of the Ems&quot;. Reconstruction of the location of other tribes in the area places the Ampsivarii on the lower Ems. The names of least two modern towns reflect that of the river and tribe: Emden (in Germany) and Emmen (in the Netherlands).

==Tacitus==
Tacitus, in his Annales explains that the Ampsivarii had refused to support Arminius in his surprise attack on three Roman legions at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD, and their leader Boiocalus, who was thrown into chains by order of Arminius.

Subsequently, the Chauci attacked them (the year 58) and drove them from their lands on the Ems. They became refugees, hosted by various tribes in the west of Germany. Meanwhile, the Roman army had cleared out the lower Rhine, which they were using as a no-man&#x27;s land between Germany and Roman Gaul. The principate had resolved to stop imperial expansion at the Rhine.

The Ampsivarii now made a bid for the land, petitioning the Roman commander in the region. Their chief Boiocalus reminding them of his 50 years of loyalty. The petition went sour, but Tacitus does not clarify the reason. The Romans were insisting on the &quot;meliorum imperia&quot;, the &quot;authority of betters&quot;, which seems to imply that the Ampsivarii were being invited to throw in their lot with the Romans.

Privately Boiocalus, as a memento of his 50-year friendship, was promised land though he felt obliged to reject on the grounds that it would make him a traitor. It is possible that his Celtic name reflects a Celtic origin of his family, in which case the question of betrayal might have been an issue, or it might simply have been that he was known to have been loyal to Rome. As it turned out the Roman offer was to be the last the Ampsivarii would receive.

They now formed a defensive alliance with the Tencteri and Bructeri, two more tribes of the future Franks, but this hasty relationship was too little and too late. The Romans entered the lands of the Tencteri and threatened to annihilate them. Both allies withdrew from the alliance, the Romans withdrew from their country, and the Ampsivarii stood alone. Having chosen to join neither side at the critical moment, they now had all sides against them.

They went on up the Rhine, hosted by some tribes, resisted by others, until the fighting men were all dead. The survivors were distributed as &quot;praeda&quot;, booty, meaning slaves, to various tribes and so the identity did not go on to appear in Ptolemy.

==Sulpicius Alexander==
The name appearing in the title belonged to a historian of Germanic tribes, Sulpicius Alexander, whose works are all lost except for quotes in Gregory of Tours. In one quote the Ampsivarii appear again some few hundred years after their loss in Tacitus. In the quote, a Roman general of Frankish family, Arbogastes (died 394), attacked the Franks across the Rhine and works some devastation. A force of Chatti and Ampsivarii under Marcomer was seen on a distant hill, but the two did not engage. The circumstances imply that some Ampsivarii had found refuge among the Chatti and still held a tribal identity.

==Notitia Dignitatum==

Not long after the death of Arbogastes the emperor, Honorius, had little time to spend on the Franks, as Italy was being overrun by Goths. Honorius was the emperor who replied to the British request for help against Anglo-Saxon invaders that they should defend themselves as best they could. The Notitia Dignitatum, which lists Roman units and their heraldry, indicates that the Franks were taken as auxiliaries into the Roman army. A unit of Ampsivarii appears there.
