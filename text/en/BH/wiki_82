<text>Dude is American slang for an individual, typically male. From the 1870s to the 1960s, dude primarily meant a male person who dressed in an extremely fashionable manner (a dandy) or a conspicuous citified person who was visiting a rural location, a &quot;city slicker&quot;. In the 1960s, dude evolved to mean any male person, a meaning that slipped into mainstream American slang in the 1970s. Current slang retains at least some use of all three of these common meanings.

==History==

The etymology of the term &quot;dude&quot; is obscure. &quot;Dude&quot; may have derived from the 18th-century word &quot;doodle&quot;, as in &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot;.

In the popular press of the 1880s and 1890s, &quot;dude&quot; was a new word for &quot;dandy&quot;—an &quot;extremely well-dressed male&quot;, a man who assigned particular importance to his appearance. The café society and Bright Young Things of the late 1800s and early 1900s were populated with dudes. Young men of leisure vied to display their wardrobes. The best known of this type is probably Evander Berry Wall, who was dubbed &quot;King of the Dudes&quot; in 1880s New York and maintained a reputation for splendor all his life. This meaning of the word, though rarely consciously known today, remains occasionally in some American slang, as in the phrase &quot;all duded up&quot; for getting dressed in fancy clothes.

The word was used to refer to American Easterners, specifically referring to a man with &quot;store-bought clothes&quot;. The word was used by cowboys to unfavorably refer to the city dwellers.

A variation of this was a &quot;well-dressed man who is unfamiliar with life outside a large city&quot;. In &quot;The Home and Farm Manual&quot; (1883), author Jonathan Periam used the term &quot;dude&quot; several times to denote an ill-bred and ignorant but ostentatious man from the city.

The implication of an individual who is unfamiliar with the demands of life outside of urban settings gave rise to the definition of dude as a &quot;city slicker&quot;, or &quot;an Easterner in the [American] West&quot;. Thus &quot;dude&quot; was used to describe the wealthy men of the expansion of the United States during the 19th century by ranch-and-homestead-bound settlers of the American Old West. This use is reflected in the &quot;dude ranch&quot;, a guest ranch catering to urbanites seeking more rural experiences. Dude ranches began to appear in the American West in the early 20th century, for wealthy Easterners who came to experience the &quot;cowboy life&quot;. The implicit contrast is with those persons accustomed to a given frontier, agricultural, mining, or other rural setting. This usage of &quot;dude&quot; was still in use in the 1950s in America, as a word for a tourist—of either sex—who attempts to dress like the local culture but fails. An inverse of these uses of &quot;dude&quot; would be the term &quot;redneck,&quot; a contemporary American colloquialism referring to poor farmers and uneducated persons, which itself became pejorative, and is also still in use.

As the word gained popularity and reached the coasts of the U.S. and traveled between borders, variations of the slang began to pop up such as the female versions of &quot;dudette&quot; and &quot;dudines&quot;; however, they were short lived due to dude also gaining a neutral gender connotation and some linguists see the female versions as more artificial slang. The slang eventually had gradual decline in usage until the early to mid 20th century when other subcultures of the U.S. began using it more frequently while again deriving it from the type of dress and eventually using it as a descriptor for common male and sometimes female companions. Eventually, lower class schools with a greater mix of subcultures allowed the word to spread to almost all cultures and eventually up the class ladders to become common use in the U.S. By the late 20th to early 21st century, dude had gained the ability to be used in the form of expression, whether that be disappointment, excitement, or loving and it also widened to be able to refer to any general person no matter race, sex, or culture.

The term was also used as a &quot;job description&quot;, such as &quot;bush hook dude&quot; as a position on a railroad in the 1880s. For an example, see the Stampede Tunnel.

In the early 1960s, dude became prominent in surfer culture as a synonym of &quot;guy&quot; or &quot;fella&quot;. The female equivalent was &quot;dudette&quot; or &quot;dudess&quot;, but these have both fallen into disuse and &quot;dude&quot; is now also used as a unisex term. This more general meaning of &quot;dude&quot; started creeping into the mainstream in the mid-1970s. &quot;Dude&quot;, particularly in surfer and &quot;bro&quot; culture, is generally used informally to address someone (&quot;Dude, I&#x27;m glad you finally called&quot;) or refer to another person (&quot;I&#x27;ve seen that dude around here before&quot;).

One of the first known references to the word in American film was in the 1969 movie &quot;Easy Rider&quot; where Wyatt (portrayed by Peter Fonda) explains to his cellmate lawyer (portrayed by Jack Nicholson) the definition of &quot;dude&quot;: &quot;Dude means nice guy; Dude means regular sort of person.&quot; Mark Farner of Grand Funk Railroad claims that drummer Don Brewer popularized the word dude with the song &quot;We&#x27;re an American Band&quot; which was released in 1973. The usage of the word to mean a &quot;cool person&quot; was further popularized in American films of the 1980s and 1990s such as &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot;, &quot;Bill and Ted&#x27;s Excellent Adventure&quot;, &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;, and &quot;Clerks&quot;.

The 1998 film &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; featured Jeff Bridges as &quot;The Dude&quot;, described as a &quot;lazy deadbeat&quot;. The character was largely inspired by activist and producer Jeff Dowd who has been called &quot;Dude&quot; since childhood. The film&#x27;s central character inspired the creation of Dudeism, a neoreligion.

In 2008, Bud Light aired an advertising campaign in which the dialogue consists entirely of different inflections of &quot;Dude!&quot; and does not mention the product by name. It was a followup to their near-identical and more widely noted &quot;Whassup?&quot; campaign.

On July 23, 2019, Boris Johnson used the word &quot;dude&quot; as an acronym for his Conservative Party leadership campaign platform. In his leadership speech he explained it as referring to Deliver Brexit – Unite the country – Defeat Jeremy Corbyn – Energize the country.

<text>The Trevi Fountain () is an 18th-century fountain in the Trevi district in Rome, Italy, designed by Italian architect Nicola Salvi and completed by Giuseppe Pannini in 1762 and several others. Standing high and wide, it is the largest Baroque fountain in the city and one of the most famous fountains in the world.

==History==

===Origins before 1629===
The fountain, at the junction of three roads (), marks the terminal point of the &quot;modern&quot; —the revived , one of the aqueducts that supplied water to ancient Rome. In 19 BC, supposedly with the help of a virgin, Roman technicians located a source of pure water some from the city. (This scene is presented on the present fountain&#x27;s façade.) However, the eventual indirect route of the aqueduct made its length some . This Aqua Virgo led the water into the Baths of Agrippa. It served Rome for more than 400 years.

During the 6th century AD, the aqueducts were not well maintained and the 14 functioning ones were damaged during the invasion of the Ostrogoths. Although compromised and greatly reduced in scope after the damage caused by the siege of the Goths of Vitiges in 537, the Acqua Vergine remained in use throughout the Middle Ages, with restorations attested as early as the 8th century, then again by the Municipality in the 12th century, on the occasion of which the conduit was also connected to other sources closer to the city, located in a place then called &quot;Trebium&quot;.

The Acqua Vergine water aqueduct carries the water to the Trevi Fountain, after having collected it from the Italian capital. The aqueduct is still in use today, despite some interventions during which the fountain remained empty. Calcium-free water is thought to be one of the causes.

===Commission, construction, and design===
In 1629, Pope Urban VIII, finding the earlier fountain insufficiently dramatic, asked Gian Lorenzo Bernini to sketch possible renovations, but the project was abandoned when the Pope died. Though Bernini&#x27;s project was never constructed, there are many Bernini touches in the fountain as it exists today. An early influential model by Pietro da Cortona, preserved in the Albertina, Vienna, also exists, as do various early 18th century sketches, most unsigned, as well as a project attributed to Nicola Michetti one attributed to Ferdinando Fuga and a French design by Edmé Bouchardon. 

Competitions had become popular during the Baroque era to design buildings, fountains, as well as the Spanish Steps. In 1730, Pope Clement XII organized a contest in which Nicola Salvi initially lost to Alessandro Galilei – but due to the outcry in Rome over a Florentine having won, Salvi was awarded the commission anyway. Work began in 1732.

When Salvi designed the fountain, a palace (now the Palazzo Poli) was on the site so he incorporated the fountain into the rear of the building.

Salvi died in 1751 with his work half finished, but he had made sure a barber&#x27;s unsightly sign would not spoil the ensemble, hiding it behind a sculpted vase, called by Romans the &quot;asso di coppe&quot;, the &quot;Ace of Cups&quot;, because of its resemblance to a Tarot card. Four different sculptors were hired to complete the fountain&#x27;s decorations: Pietro Bracci (whose statue of Oceanus sits in the central niche), Filippo della Valle, Giovanni Grossi, and Andrea Bergondi. Giuseppe Pannini (1718-1805), son of Giovanni Paolo Panini, was hired as architect.

The Trevi Fountain was finished in 1762 by Pannini, who substituted the present allegories for planned sculptures of Agrippa and Trivia, the Roman virgin. It was officially opened and inaugurated on 22 May by Pope Clement XIII. The majority of the piece is made from Travertine stone, quarried near Tivoli, about east of Rome.

The name of the fountain derives from the Latin word , meaning &quot;intersection of three streets&quot;. The statue is located right in the center of 
Via De&#x27; Crocicchi, Via Poli and Via Delle Muratte.

===Restorations===
The fountain was refurbished once in 1988 to remove discoloration caused by smog, and again in 1998; the stonework was scrubbed and all cracks and other areas of deterioration were repaired by skilled artisans, and the fountain was equipped with recirculating pumps. In January 2013, it was announced that the Italian fashion company Fendi would sponsor a 20-month, 2.2-million-euro restoration of the fountain, the most thorough in the fountain&#x27;s history. Restoration work began in June 2014 and was completed in November 2015. The fountain was reopened with an official ceremony on the evening of 3 November 2015. The restoration included the installation of more than 100 LED lights to improve the nighttime illumination of the fountain.

===2023 protest===
On 21 May 2023, activists of the climate group Ultima Generazione (Last Generation) climate protest group vandalized the fountain by dyeing the water with charcoal. Rome Mayor Roberto Gualtieri criticized the attacks on heritage sites. As the fountain recirculates the water, cleaning of the fountain would need the 300,000 litres of polluted water to be emptied and replaced resulting in significant costs. Ryan Maue, the former chief scientist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, stated the attack was done by &quot;climate eco-anarchists&quot;.

==Iconography==
The backdrop for the fountain is the Palazzo Poli, given a new façade with a giant order of Corinthian pilasters that link the two main storeys. &quot;Taming of the waters&quot; is the theme of the gigantic scheme that tumbles forward, mixing water and rockwork, and filling the small square. Tritons guide Oceanus&#x27;s shell chariot, taming hippocamps.

In the centre, a robustly-modelled triumphal arch is superimposed on the palazzo façade. The centre niche or exedra framing Oceanus has free-standing columns for maximal light and shade. In the niches flanking Oceanus, &quot;Abundance&quot; spills water from her urn and &quot;Salubrity&quot; holds a cup from which a snake drinks. Above, bas reliefs illustrate the Roman origin of the aqueducts.

The Tritons and horses provide symmetrical balance, with the maximum contrast in their mood and poses (by 1730, Rococo was already in full bloom in France and Germany).

==Coin throwing==
The best known and most persistent tradition consists of throwing a coin into the fountain before leaving &quot;the eternal city&quot;, a superstition associated with the fountain being that whoever makes this gesture would favor a future return to the city. Coins are purportedly meant to be thrown while turning one&#x27;s back to the fountain, using the right hand over the left shoulder. This was the theme of 1954&#x27;s &quot;Three Coins in the Fountain&quot; and the Academy Award-winning song by that name which introduced the picture.

An estimated 3,000 euros are thrown into the fountain each day. In 2016, an estimated €1.4 million (US$1.5 million) was thrown into the fountain. The money thrown into the fountain is donated to the Caritas association, which uses it for charity work; however, there are regular attempts to steal coins from the fountain, although it is illegal to do so.

Due to the popularity of the fountain drawing in large crowds, Rome officials are considering options for limiting access to the fountain for tourists, such as accepting reservations. A platform will be built around the fountain&#x27;s lower basin, accessible to a limited number of visitors. A queuing system was finally implemented following the fountain&#x27;s reopening in December 2024, which came after a three-month restoration period. A maximum cap of 400 visitors was imposed.

==In popular culture==
The Trevi Fountain is depicted in the third movement, &quot;The Trevi Fountain at Noon&quot;, of Ottorino Respighi&#x27;s 1916 symphonic poem &quot;Fountains of Rome&quot;.

The fountain has appeared in several films, including &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; (1953); &quot;Three Coins in the Fountain&quot; (1954); Federico Fellini&#x27;s classic, &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; (1960); &quot;Sabrina Goes to Rome&quot; (1998); and &quot;The Lizzie McGuire Movie&quot; (2003). In Federico Fellini&#x27;s 1960 film &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot;, Anita Ekberg wades into the fountain with Marcello Mastroianni.

In 1973, the Italian national postal service dedicated a postage stamp to the Trevi Fountain.

Lego is releasing a set based on Trevi Fountain. That set is set to come out on March 1, 2025.

==Replicas==
An and similar façade construction as monument was built in 2023 at Serra Negra, Brazil. Another copy is located near Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, and another replica can be found in Jamsil station of the Seoul Metro Subway. Yet another replica is located in the Xetulul Theme Park, Retalhuleu Department, Guatemala.

<text>The Liberty Bowl is an annual American college football bowl game played in late December or early January since 1959. For its first five years, it was played at Philadelphia Municipal Stadium in Philadelphia before being held at Atlantic City (New Jersey) Convention Hall in 1964. Since 1965, the game has been held at Simmons Bank Liberty Stadium in Memphis, Tennessee. Because of the scheduling of the bowl game near the end of the calendar year, no game was played during calendar years 2008 or 2015, while two games were played in calendar years 2010 and 2016.

Since 2004, the game has been sponsored by Memphis-based auto parts retailer AutoZone and officially known as the &quot;AutoZone Liberty Bowl&quot;. Previous sponsors include St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital (1993–1996) and AXA Financial (1997–2003).

==History==

A. F. &quot;Bud&quot; Dudley, a former Villanova athletic director, created the Liberty Bowl in Philadelphia in 1959. The game was played at Philadelphia&#x27;s Municipal Stadium. It was the only cold-weather bowl game of its time, and was plagued by poor attendance. The first game was the most successful of the five held in Philadelphia, as 38,000 fans watched Penn State beat Alabama, 7–0, in the bowl&#x27;s inaugural edition.

A group of Atlantic City businessmen convinced Dudley to move his game from Philadelphia to Atlantic City&#x27;s Convention Hall for 1964 and guaranteed Dudley $25,000. It would be the first major (University Division, now Division I) bowl game played indoors. AstroTurf was still in its developmental stages and was unavailable for the game. Convention Hall was equipped with a grass surface with of burlap underneath it (as padding) on top of concrete. To keep the grass growing, artificial lighting was installed and kept on 24 hours a day. The entire process cost about $16,000. End zones were only 8 yards long, rather than the regulation 10 yards. 6,059 fans saw Utah rout West Virginia, 32–6. Dudley was paid $25,000 from Atlantic City businessmen, $60,000 from the gate, and $95,000 from television revenues, and cleared $10,000 net profit.

In 1965, Dudley moved the game to Memphis, Tennessee, where it made its home at Memphis Memorial Stadium to much larger crowds; the venue was renamed as Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium in December 1975. Having been played every college football season since 1959, the game has established itself as one of the oldest non-New Year&#x27;s Six bowls.

==Matchup==
During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Liberty Bowl offered an automatic invitation to the winner of the Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s Trophy, if that team was bowl eligible. Due to the limited success of service academy football during this era, the only academy to appear in the Liberty Bowl as a result of this arrangement was Air Force, which appeared in four consecutive games, 1989–1992.

Beginning in 1996, the Liberty Bowl began an affiliation with the newly launched Conference USA (C-USA), offering its champion an automatic bid. Beginning in 2005, the winner of C-USA was determined by the newly created C-USA championship game. The winner of that game was customarily offered the bowl berth from 2005 to 2013.

In 1996 and 1997, the opponent for the C-USA champion was a team from the Big East. In 1998, the Liberty Bowl replaced the Holiday Bowl in a shared contract with the Cotton Bowl and had second choice between the WAC champion and a team from the SEC. From 1999 to 2005, the opponent for the C-USA champion was the Mountain West champion. There were two exceptions:
*2004: Mountain West champion Utah qualified for the BCS. In their place, the Liberty Bowl chose WAC champion Boise State.
*2005: Mountain West champion TCU chose to play in the 2005 Houston Bowl. At-large WAC team Fresno State took their place.

In 1999, the Mountain West Conference did not have an outright champion, as three teams tied for the conference lead. The conference&#x27;s bid for the game was given to Colorado State.

The bowl&#x27;s contract from 2006 until 2013 pitted the winner of the C-USA championship game against the eighth pick from the SEC. The American was to provide its fifth-place team as an alternate if the SEC could not provide a team. The SEC was also given veto power for the bowl, and elected to use it in 2011 to block C-USA champion Southern Miss from playing Vanderbilt; instead, Cincinnati got the spot and Southern Miss accepted an invitation to the 2011 Hawaii Bowl instead.

Since 2014, the matchup features a team from the SEC against the fourth pick from the Big 12 Conference. The Liberty Bowl is part of a six-bowl SEC pool arrangement that also involves the Duke&#x27;s Mayo (formerly Belk) in odd-numbered years or the Las Vegas in even-numbered years, Music City, ReliaQuest, Gator, and Texas bowls; these bowls will choose one representative from the conference each, while the College Football Playoff receiving first choice (usually the Sugar Bowl in years it does not serve as a national semifinal) and the Citrus Bowl second choice.

The game is televised nationally on ESPN, and is carried nationwide by ESPN Radio, and internationally by ESPN International.

===Recent matchups of note===
The 2010 win by UCF was the program&#x27;s first-ever bowl victory.

The 2011 game matched Coaches&#x27; Poll 24th-ranked Cincinnati against upstart Vanderbilt, and unlike most lower tier bowls, it aired on the broadcast network ABC rather than its cable brethren ESPN. Cincinnati defeated Vanderbilt in a second-half comeback.

The 2012 Liberty Bowl featured an unusual rematch of a regular season game between the Iowa State Cyclones (9th place in the Big 12) and the Tulsa Golden Hurricane (C-USA champions). Iowa State had defeated Tulsa, 38–23, in the season&#x27;s first weekend, however Tulsa defeated Iowa State, 31–17, in the Liberty Bowl. Though the bowl normally selects a team from the SEC, it invited Iowa State because the SEC did not have enough bowl-eligible teams to fill all of its contracted bowl games.

In 2020, after a matchup of West Virginia and Tennessee was announced on December 20, the Tennessee program had to withdraw on December 21 due to positive COVID-19 testing. Army, who had accepted an invitation to the Independence Bowl before it was cancelled due to a lack of available teams, was named as their replacement.

In the 2022 matchup, Kansas made their first bowl game appearance in 14 years, against Arkansas. The Razorbacks took an early 38–13 lead in the game. The Jayhawks then scored 25 unanswered points to send the game into overtime. The teams traded touchdowns in the first and second overtime. In the third overtime, with teams alternating two-point conversion attempts per NCAA overtime rules, the Razorbacks scored on their attempt and stopped the Jayhawks&#x27; attempt, resulting in a 55–53 Arkansas win. Kansas quarterback Jalon Daniels set a Kansas single-game record and a Liberty Bowl record for passing yards, with 544.

<doc id="335750" wikidata="Q3139335" url="?curid=335750" title="Holiday Bowl">
<text>The Holiday Bowl is an annual college football bowl game held in San Diego, California. Operating since 1978, its current conference tie-ins are with the Pac-12 Conference and the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). The bowl is held at Snapdragon Stadium; it was played at San Diego Stadium from 1978 to 2019, and at Petco Park from 2021 to 2023. 

Historically, the Holiday Bowl had a long-standing tie-in with the Western Athletic Conference (WAC). During this period, the bowl hosted the game that clinched the national championship for the BYU Cougars in 1984, one of only two times a non-New Year&#x27;s Six bowl game has done this. The bowl also previously had tie-ins with the Big 12 Conference and the Big Ten Conference.

==History==

The Holiday Bowl was founded in 1978 to give the Western Athletic Conference an automatic bowl bid after the Fiesta Bowl, which previously had a tie-in with the conference, ended its association with the WAC following the departure of Arizona and Arizona State (the latter of which served as the game&#x27;s host) to join the Pacific-8 Conference in the summer of 1978, leading to the conference renaming itself as the Pacific-10. The Holiday Bowl inherited the Fiesta Bowl&#x27;s former WAC ties and gave the conference&#x27;s champion its automatic bid. For the first several editions, the WAC champion played an at-large team; from 1991 through 1994, the Big Ten Conference was given the second bid, provided it had enough bowl-eligible teams.

Beginning in 1995, the Big Eight Conference replaced the Big Ten and remained tied with the bowl as the conference expanded to become the Big 12 the following year. The WAC&#x27;s automatic bid was split, with first choice given to the Cotton Bowl Classic in Dallas, and a team from the Pacific-10 was added as the alternate pick (meaning that, if the WAC champion played in the Cotton Bowl, a Pacific-10 team would play in the Holiday Bowl). The WAC ended its association with the Holiday Bowl after 1997, and the game became a matchup between the Big 12 and Pacific-10.

From 1998 to 2009, the matchup featured the No. 2 team in the Pacific-10/Pac-12 and the No. 3 Big 12 team, but the Alamo Bowl outbid the Holiday Bowl to feature that matchup beginning in 2010. Holiday Bowl Executive Director Bruce Binkowski stated that average ticket prices for the Holiday Bowl would have had to be increased from $60 to $100 to match the Alamo Bowl&#x27;s offer of a $3 million payout (the Holiday Bowl was only offering $2.35 million). The Pac-12 and Big 12 retained their contracts with the Holiday Bowl, however, and the 2010–2013 matchups pitted the No. 3 Pac-12 team against the No. 5 Big 12 team.

Starting with the 2014 game, the Big Ten signed a six-year contract to return after a 20-year absence to the Holiday Bowl, regaining the slot that it had held from 1991 to 1994. With this agreement, the Holiday Bowl featured the No. 3 Pac-12 team and the No. 4 Big Ten team. In 2019, the bowl announced plans to host a Pac-12 team and an Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) team during the 2020-2025 games.

Through 2019, the bowl was played at San Diego Stadium. The stadium was demolished beginning in the autumn of 2020, at which point the game was played at Petco Park. In 2024, the bowl returned to Mission Valley playing in Snapdragon Stadium, built on the site of San Diego Stadium. 

On October 22, 2020, organizers canceled the 2020 edition of the bowl, citing complications from the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2021 edition was called off hours before kickoff on December 28, due to COVID-19 protocol issues within the UCLA program, and officially canceled the next morning, after organizers could not secure a replacement team to face NC State. In May 2023, organizers of the Holiday Bowl filed a lawsuit in San Diego County, seeking $3 million in damages from the Pac-12 and UCLA due to their withdrawal from the 2021 game. Organizers also stated that since reimbursement was not provided for cancellation of the 2021 game, the bowl withheld a $3.2 million payment to Pac-12 member Oregon for the 2022 game.

Sponsors of the game have included SeaWorld; Thrifty Car Rental; Chrysler Corporation (through its Plymouth brand); Culligan; Pacific Life; Bridgepoint Education; National University; National Funding, a San Diego–based alternative lender; San Diego County Credit Union, which formerly sponsored San Diego&#x27;s other bowl game, the now-defunct Poinsettia Bowl; and DirecTV.

==Notable games==
For the first seven games, BYU represented the WAC as its champion. In the inaugural 1978 game, the Navy Midshipmen came in with an 8–3 record and a Commander-in-Chief&#x27;s Trophy and then capped their season with a 23–16 comeback victory over the highly favored Cougars. BYU has played in a total of 11 Holiday Bowls, more than any other team. The 1980 game was known as &quot;The Miracle Bowl&quot; as BYU erased a 20-point SMU lead in the last two minutes of the game, tying the score on the last play of the game—a 60-yard pass from All-American quarterback Jim McMahon to tight end Clay Brown as time expired. BYU kicker Kurt Gunther added the game-winning extra point.

The 1983 game between BYU and Missouri had its own dramatic ending, as BYU rallied behind All-American quarterback Steve Young. With just 23 seconds left, Young gave a handoff to Eddie Stinnett. Stinnett then turned around and passed it back to Steve Young, who caught it and ran in for a touchdown, giving BYU a 21–17 win. Young achieved a rare feat in college football: one touchdown pass, one touchdown run, and one touchdown reception all in a single game. For his efforts, he was named offensive MVP.

In the 1984 edition, BYU secured the national championship by defeating the Michigan Wolverines, 24–17. Because of the WAC&#x27;s contract with the Holiday Bowl, BYU, top-ranked and the only undefeated team in Division I-A going into that season&#x27;s bowls, was obligated to play in the mid-tier Holiday Bowl against a mediocre (6–5) Michigan squad. Again, the Holiday Bowl came down to the final few plays. BYU drove the length of the field and scored on a pass from injured All-American quarterback Robbie Bosco to Kelly Smith with 1:23 remaining. Marv Allen, who had played in the very first Holiday Bowl as a redshirt freshman in 1978, sealed the victory with an interception. This game marks a rare example of a non-New Year&#x27;s Six bowl game featuring a team later named national champion.

The fiord is most commonly accessed via road (State Highway 94) by tour coach, with the road terminating at a small village also called Milford Sound.

Milford Sound / Piopiotahi is one of roughly 90 places to have been given a dual name as part of a 1998 Treaty of Waitangi settlement with Ngāi Tahu, recognising the significance of the fiord to both Māori and Pākehā New Zealanders. This name consists of both the Māori name and the former European name used together as a single name, instead of as interchangeable alternate names. 

In te reo Māori, the fiord is known as &quot;Piopiotahi&quot; after the now extinct piopio, a thrush-like bird that used to inhabit New Zealand. According to the Māori legend of Māui trying to win immortality for mankind, a single piopio flew to the fiord in mourning following Māui&#x27;s death. The name Piopiotahi refers to this bird, with &quot;tahi&quot; meaning &#x27;one&#x27; in Māori.
The fiord was given its European name in 1823, when the sealer John Grono named it Milford Sound after Milford Haven in his birthplace of Wales. The Cleddau River, which flows into the fiord, was also named for its Welsh namesake.

==Geography==
As a fiord, Milford Sound was formed by a process of glaciation over millions of years. The village at the end of the fiord is also known as Milford Sound.

Milford Sound runs inland from the Tasman Sea at Dale Point (also named after a location close to Milford Haven in Wales)—the mouth of the fiord—and is surrounded by sheer rock faces that rise or more on either side. Among the peaks are The Elephant at , said to resemble an elephant&#x27;s head, and The Lion, , in the shape of a crouching lion.

Milford Sound sports two permanent waterfalls, Lady Bowen Falls and Stirling Falls. After heavy rain temporary waterfalls can be seen running down the steep sided rock faces that line the fiord. They are fed by rainwater-drenched moss and will last a few days at most once the rain stops.

===Climate===
With a mean annual rainfall of each year, a high level even for the West Coast, Milford Sound is known as the wettest inhabited place in New Zealand and one of the wettest in the world. Rainfall can reach during 24 hours. The rainfall creates dozens of temporary waterfalls (as well as several major, more permanent ones) cascading down the cliff faces, some reaching a thousand metres in length. Smaller falls from such heights may never reach the bottom of the sound, drifting away in the wind.

Accumulated rainwater can, at times, cause portions of the rain forest to lose their grip on the sheer cliff faces, resulting in tree avalanches into the fiord. The regrowth of the rainforest after these avalanches can be seen in several locations along the sound.

===Wildlife===
Milford Sound is home to a variety of marine mammals, including seals and the southernmost wild population of bottlenose dolphins. Whales, especially the humpback and southern right whales, are increasingly observed due to the recoveries of each species. Penguins are also common within the sound, which is a breeding site for the Fiordland penguin and has subsequently been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International.

As a result of Milford Sound&#x27;s high rainfall and the density of salt water, the surface of Milford Sound is a layer of freshwater containing tannins from the surrounding rainforest. This filters much of the sunlight which enters the water, allowing for a variety of Black coral to be found at depths of as shallow as , significantly closer to the surface than usual.

==History==

Milford Sound was initially overlooked by European explorers because its narrow entry did not appear to lead into such large interior bays. Sailing ship captains such as James Cook, who bypassed Milford Sound on his journeys for just this reason, also feared venturing too close to the steep mountainsides, afraid that wind conditions would prevent escape.

The fiord was a playground for local Māori who had acquired a large amount of local marine knowledge including tidal patterns and fish feeding patterns over generations before European arrival.
The fiord remained undiscovered by Europeans until Captain John Grono discovered it and named it Milford Haven after his homeland in Wales. Captain John Lort Stokes later renamed Milford Haven as Milford Sound. Following the passage of the Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998, the name of the fiord was officially altered to Milford Sound / Piopiotahi.

While Fiordland as such remained one of the least-explored areas of New Zealand up to the 20th century, Milford Sound&#x27;s natural beauty soon attracted national and international renown, and led to the discovery of the McKinnon Pass in 1888, soon to become a part of the new Milford Track, an early walking tourism trail. In the same year, the low watershed saddle between the Hollyford River and the Cleddau River was discovered, where the Homer Tunnel was to be developed about sixty years later to provide road access.

As of the 2006 census, just 120 people lived in Milford Sound, most of them working in tourism or conservation.

==Tourism==


===Overview===
Milford Sound attracts between 550,000 and 1 million visitors per year. This makes the sound one of New Zealand&#x27;s most-visited tourist spots even with its remote location and long journey times from the nearest population centres. Many tourists take one of the boat tours which usually last one to two hours. They are offered by several companies, departing from the Milford Sound Visitors&#x27; Centre.

Tramping, canoeing, and some other water sports are possible. A small number of companies also provide overnight boat trips. There is otherwise only limited accommodation at the sound, and only a very small percentage of tourists stay more than the day. Tourists usually stay in Te Anau or Queenstown.

The Milford Discovery Centre &amp; Underwater Observatory is located in Harrisons Cove on the north side of the fiord. Situated within the Piopiotahi Marine Reserve, the underwater observatory allows visitors to view the fiord&#x27;s unique marine environment at a depth of . Due to a natural phenomenon called &#x27;deep water emergence,&#x27; deep-water animals such as black coral can be viewed in the shallow waters surrounding the observatory. A dark surface layer of fresh water, stained brown by tannins from the surrounding forest, along with cold water temperatures allow the black corals to grow close to the surface throughout Milford Sound and Fiordland.

Milford Sound is also a destination for cruise ships.

===Transport===
By road, Milford Sound is from Queenstown and from Invercargill (about four hours&#x27; drive), with most of the tour buses to the sound departing from Queenstown. Some tourists also arrive from the smaller tourism centre of Te Anau, away. There are also scenic flights by light aircraft and helicopter tours to and from Milford Sound Airport. The drive to Milford Sound itself passes through unspoiled mountain landscapes before entering the Homer Tunnel which emerges into rain-forest-carpeted canyons that descend to the sound. The winding mountain road, while of high standards, is very prone to avalanches and closures during the winter half of the year.

The long distance to the sound means that tourist operators from Queenstown all depart very early in the day, arriving back only late in the evening. This ensures that most tourists visit Milford Sound within a few hours around midday, leading to congestion on the roads and at the tourist facilities during the main season. The peak-time demand is also why a large number of tour boats are active in the sound at much the same time.

Over the years, various options for shortening the distance to Milford Sound from Queenstown have been mooted, including a gondola route, a new tunnel from Queenstown, or a monorail from near Lake Wakatipu to Te Anau Downs. All would reduce the current round-trip duration (which has to travel via Te Anau), thus allowing tourism to be spread out over more of the day. While a gondola is considered out of the running after the New Zealand Department of Conservation (DOC) declined approval for environmental reasons, the tunnel and the monorail proposals have applied to the DOC for concessions for land access.

There are a variety of plane charter companies that fly to Milford Sound. Most of the companies fly out of Queenstown International Airport.

==Diesel spill==

On 8 February 2004, a spill of of diesel fuel was discovered, resulting in a 2-kilometre spill which closed the fiord for two days while intensive cleanup activities were completed. A hose was apparently used to displace the fuel from the tanks of one of the tour vessels, and various government officials claimed it appeared to be an act of ecoterrorism motivated by rising numbers of tourists to the park, though more details did not become known.

<text>The , sometimes shortened to the Inland Sea, is the body of water separating Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu, three of the four main islands of Japan. It serves as a waterway connecting the Pacific Ocean to the Sea of Japan. It connects to Osaka Bay and provides a sea transport link to industrial centers in the Kansai region, including Osaka and Kobe. Before the construction of the San&#x27;yō Main Line, it was the main transportation link between Kansai and Kyūshū. 

Yamaguchi, Hiroshima, Okayama, Hyōgo, Osaka, Wakayama, Kagawa, Ehime, Tokushima, Fukuoka, and Ōita prefectures have coastlines on the Seto Inland Sea; the cities of Hiroshima, Iwakuni, Takamatsu, and Matsuyama are also located on it.

The Setouchi region encompasses the sea and surrounding coastal areas. The region is known for its moderate climate, with a stable year-round temperature and relatively low rainfall levels. The sea experiences periodic red tides caused by dense groupings of certain phytoplankton that result in the death of large numbers of fish. Since the 1980s, the sea&#x27;s northern and southern shores have been connected by the three routes of the Honshū–Shikoku Bridge Project, including the Great Seto Bridge, which serves both railroad and automobile traffic.

==Extent==
The International Hydrographic Organization&#x27;s definition of the limits of the Seto Inland Sea (published in 1953) is as follows:

&quot;On the West.&quot; The southeastern limit of the Japan Sea [In Shimonoseki-kaikyo. A line running from Nagoya Saki (130°49&#x27;E) in Kyûsû through the islands of Uma Sima and Muture Simia (33°58&#x27;,5N) to Murasaki Hana (34°01&#x27;N) in Honsyû].

&quot;On the East (Kii Suidô).&quot; A line running from Takura Saki (34°16&#x27;N) in Honsyû to Oishi Hana in the island of Awazi, through this island to Sio Saki (34°11&#x27;N) and on to Oiso Saki in Sikoku.

&quot;On the South (Bungo Suidô).&quot; A line joining Sada Misaki (33°20&#x27;N) in Sikoku and Seki Saki in Kyûsyû.
==Geographical features==

The Seto Inland Sea is 450 km (280 mi) long from east to west. The width from south to north varies from 15 to 55 km (10 to 34 mi). In most places, the water is relatively shallow. The average depth is 38 m (125 ft); the greatest depth is 105 m (344 ft).

Hydrologically, Seto Inland Sea is not a true inland sea, being neither an epeiric body of water like Hudson Bay nor an isolated endorheic basin like the Caspian Sea. Rather, it is actually a marginal sea: a division of a wider ocean (in this case the Pacific) which is partially enclosed by islands, archipelagos, or peninsulas (here, the Japanese Home Islands), adjacent to or widely open to the open ocean at the surface. The Naruto Strait connects the eastern part of the Seto Inland Sea to the Kii Channel, which in turn connects to the Pacific. The western part of the Seto Inland Sea connects to the Sea of Japan through the Kanmon Straits and to the Pacific through the Bungo Channel.

Each part of the Seto Inland Sea has a separate name in Japanese. For example, refers to the strait between Ehime, Yamaguchi, and Ōita prefectures in the western portion of the sea; is the open expanse west of the Geiyo Islands, near Hiroshima prefecture; and refers to the expanse between Yamaguchi prefecture and Suō-Ōshima. These areas are sometimes styled Iyonada, Akinada, and Suonada. There are also many straits located between the major islands, as well as a number of smaller ones that pass between islands or connect the Seto Inland Sea to other seas or the Pacific. Almost 3,000 islands are located in the Seto Inland Sea. The largest island is Awaji-shima, and the second largest is Shōdo-shima. Many of the smaller islands are uninhabited.

===Major islands===
*Eastern part: Awaji Island, Shōdo Island, Ieshima Islands, Naoshima Islands, Shiwaku Islands, Yumeshima
*Central part: Geiyo Islands (including Ōmishima, Innoshima), Itsukushima (popularly known as Miyajima), Hinase Islands, Kasaoka Islands
*Western part: Suō-Ōshima, Uwakai Islands, Hashira-jima Islands.

==Fauna==
Over 500 marine species are known to live in the Seto Inland Sea. Examples are the ayu, an amphidromous fish, horseshoe crab, finless porpoise, and great white shark, which has occasionally attacked people in the Seto Inland Sea. In the past, whales entered the sea to feed or breed, however because of whaling and pollution, they are rarely seen.

==History==

During the last ice age, the sea level was lower than today. After the ice age, sea water poured into a basin between the Chūgoku mountains and Shikoku mountains and formed the Seto Inland Sea as it is known today. From ancient times, the Seto Inland Sea served as a main transport line between its coastal areas, including what is today the Kansai region and Kyushu. It was also a main transport line between Japan and other countries, including Korea and China. Even after the creation of major highways such as the Nankaidō and San&#x27;yōdō, the Seto Inland Sea remained a major transport route. There are records that some foreign emissaries from China and Korea sailed on the Seto Inland Sea.

The importance of water traffic gave rise to private navies in the region. In many documents, these navies were called , or simply pirates. Sometimes they were considered to be public enemies, but in most cases they were granted the right to self-governance as a result of their strength. During the feudal period, &quot;suigun&quot; seized power in most coastal areas. The Kono in Iyo Province (today Ehime Prefecture) and Kobayakawa (later Mōri) in Aki Province (today a part of Hiroshima Prefecture) clans were two of the more famous &quot;suigun&quot; lords. In the 12th century, Taira no Kiyomori planned to move the capital from Kyoto to the coastal village of Fukuhara (today Kobe) to promote trade between Japan and the Song dynasty of China. This transfer was unsuccessful, and soon after Kyoto became the capital again. Later, the Battle of Yashima took place off the coast of present-day Takamatsu. 

In the Edo period, the Seto Inland Sea was one of the busiest transport lines in Japan. It was a part of a navigational route around Japan&#x27;s islands via the Sea of Japan. Many ships navigated from its coastal areas to the area along the Sea of Japan. Major ports in the Edo period were Osaka, Sakai, Shimotsui, Ushimado, and Tomonoura. The Seto Inland Sea also served many &quot;daimyōs&quot; in the western area of Japan as their route to and from Edo, to fulfill their obligations under &quot;sankin-kōtai&quot;. Many used ships from Osaka. Thanks to transport through the Seto Inland Sea, Osaka became the economic center of Japan. Each &quot;han&quot; had an office called &quot;Ozakayashiki&quot; in Osaka. These &quot;Ozakayashiki&quot; were among Japan&#x27;s earliest forms of banks, facilitating domestic trade and helping to organize the income of the &quot;daimyo&quot;, which was in the form of &quot;koku&quot;, giant bales of rice.

The Seto Inland Sea was also part of the official Chosendentsushi route, bringing Korean emissaries to the shogunate. After the Meiji Restoration, the coastal cities along the Seto Inland Sea were rapidly industrialized. One of the headquarters of the Japanese Navy was built in the town of Kure. Since the Meiji period, development of land transport has been reducing the importance of the Seto Inland Sea as a transport line. Remarkable land transportation innovations include the San&#x27;yō Main Railroad Line in Honshū and the Yosan Main Railroad Line in Shikoku (both completed before World War II) and three series of bridges connecting Honshū and Shikoku (completed in the late 20th century). The Seto Inland Sea is still used, however, by an international cargo transport line and several local transport lines connecting Honshū with Shikoku and Kyūshū.

==Industry==
Major cities with heavy industrial activity on the coast of the Seto Inland Sea include Osaka, Kobe, and Hiroshima. Smaller scale manufacturing and industry can also be found in Kurashiki, Kure, Fukuyama, and Ube in Honshū, and Sakaide, Imabari, and Niihama in Shikoku. Major industries include steel production, vehicle manufacture, ship building, textiles, and since the 1960s, oil refining and chemical products.
Imabari Shipbuilding, Japan&#x27;s largest ship building company, has its headquarters and some of its yards in Imabari, Ehime Prefecture. Thanks to the moderate climate and beautiful landscape, fishing, agriculture, and tourism bring a lot of income to the area as well. 

== Transport ==

Today the Seto Inland Sea serves its coastal areas mainly for two purposes: first, international or domestic cargo transportation, and second, local transportation between coastal areas and islands on the sea. Major ports are Kobe, Okayama, Takamatsu, Tokushima, Matsuyama, and Hiroshima. 

Historically, the Seto Inland Sea as transport line served four coastal areas: Kansai, Chūgoku, Shikoku, and eastern Kyūshū. The Seto Inland Sea provided each of these regions with local transportation and connected each region to the others and far areas, including the coastal area of the Sea of Japan, Korea, and China. After Kobe port was founded in 1868 to serve foreign ships, the Seto Inland Sea became a major international waterway with connection to the Pacific.

Development of land transportation shifted the travel between east and west — that is, between Honshū and Kyūshū — to railroad and road transport. Two coastal railways, San&#x27;yō Main Line in Honshū and Yosan Main Line, were built. Those railway lines stimulated the local economy and once invoked a rail mania. Many short railroads were planned to connect a certain station of those two lines and a local seaport on the Seto Inland Sea, and some of them were actually built. The Ministry of Railroads, later the Japanese National Railways and then Shikoku Railway Company, ran some train ferry lines between Honshū and Shikoku including the line between Uno Station (Tamano) and Takamatsu Station (Takamatsu). When the Great Seto Bridge was finished and began to serve the two coastal areas, that ferry line was abolished.

===Highways and bridges===

The main islands Honshū and Shikoku are connected by three series of bridges since the late 1980s. This improves land transportation between the connected islands. These series of bridges, collectively known as the Honshū–Shikoku Bridge Project, are, from east to west, Akashi Kaikyo Bridge, Great Seto Bridge, and Nishiseto Expressway.

====Kobe-Awaji-Naruto Highway====
The easternmost highway was built between 1976 and 1998. It leads from Akashi (Hyōgo Prefecture) on the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge (the second-longest suspension bridge in the world) to Awaji Island, from there via the Ōnaruto Bridge to Ōge-jima (Naruto, Tokushima Prefecture) beyond the 1.3-kilometer wide Naruto Strait and finally across the Muya Bridge to Shikoku.

====Seto Chuo Highway====
The Great Seto Bridge connects Okayama Prefecture with Kagawa Prefecture since 1988. It consists of a total of six two-storey bridges, whose lower floors are used by the railway (Japan Railways Group). The high speed Shinkansen does not go to or on Shikoku.

====Nishiseto Highway / Shimanami Highway====
This is the first of three intersections of the Seto Inland Sea. Construction started in 1975, but was fully completed in 1999. It connects the Nishiseto- Onomichi Highway in Hiroshima Prefecture with a total of ten bridges and several smaller islands with Imabari in Ehime Prefecture. Approximately 100,000 people live on those islands. The bridges are: Shin Onomichi Bridge, Innoshima Bridge, Ikuchi Bridge, Tatara Bridge, Ōmishima Bridge, the two Ōshima bridges and the three Kurushima Kaikyo bridges. The Kurushima Kaikyō Bridge connects the island of Ōshima to the main island of Shikoku.

====Other bridges====
The Akinada Tobishima Kaido route connects seven of the western Geiyo Islands to mainland Honshu near Kure, Hiroshima.

===Maritime===
Seto Naikai Pilots Area provides compulsory maritime piloting for vessels over 10,000 tones, it was divided into sections of Bisanseto and sections of Kurushima, connecting Kanmon Channel Piloting Area and Osaka Bay Piloting Area.

==Major tourist sites==
The coastal area of the Seto Inland Sea is one Japan&#x27;s major tourist destinations. Even before the country opened to foreigners in the middle of the 19th century, the sea&#x27;s beauty was praised and introduced to the Western world by those who visited Japan, including Philipp Franz von Siebold, and after the country&#x27;s opening, Ferdinand von Richthofen and Thomas Cook.

Its coastal area, except for Osaka Prefecture and a part of Wakayama Prefecture, was appointed the on March 16, 1934, as one of three oldest national parks in Japan.

Itsukushima Shrine, on the island of Itsukushima in the city of Hatsukaichi, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Shōdoshima, nicknamed the &quot;island of olives&quot;, and the Naruto whirlpools are two other well-known tourist sites. Neighboring locations like Kotohira and Okayama are often combined with the tour of the Setouchi region. Some historic sites, including Yashima in Takamatsu and Kurashiki, also attract many visitors. Hiroshima is the neighbor city to Itsukushima Shrine and another UNESCO World Heritage Site because of atomic bomb damage in 1945. Idol Unit STU48 operate on a cruise on the Setuchi.

The eastern end of the Sea hosts the Setouchi Triennale art festival, which was inaugurated in 2010. Some events take place on the island of Naoshima, known colloquially as the art island, and the home of several permanent museums. 

At the far eastern extremity, as the Sea meets the Pacific Ocean, are the Naruto whirlpools that can be reached by sight-seeing boats.

The Shiwaku Islands are a defined group numbering 28 that can be reached by ferry boat from Marugame. Here Richard Henry Brunton built one of his lighthouses that can still be seen, and the grave of Frank Toovey Lake, a young midshipman in his survey party, is on the island of Sanuki Hiroshima.

In the central area of Seto Inland Sea is Mount Ishizuchi on Shikoku. It is the highest mountain in western Japan and the highest mountain on Shikoku. 

In the western end of the Sea is Mimosusogawa Park in Shimonoseki. It commemorates the final stage of the Genpei war between the feudal Taira clan and Minamoto clan (1180–1185).

==Literature==
Some sites along the Seto Inland Sea were featured in eighth-century Japanese literature, both in prose and in verse, including , , and . Since some sites were used as places of exile, their feeling and landscape were evoked in waka. In fiction, in &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;, Genji fled from Kyoto and resided in Suma (now a part of Kobe) and Akashi for two years.

In medieval literature, because of the Genpei War, the Seto Inland Sea is one of the important backgrounds of &quot;The Tale of the Heike&quot;, particularly in its latter part.

In the Western world, Donald Richie wrote a literary nonfiction travelogue called &quot;The Inland Sea&quot; relating a journey along the sea, beginning from the East at Himeji and ending at Miyajima in the West, close to Hiroshima, going from island to island, exploring the landscape, meeting and discussing with local people, as well as musing on Japanese culture, the nature of travel and of identity, and his own personal sense of identity.
In 1991, filmmakers Lucille Carra and Brian Cotnoir produced a film version of Richie&#x27;s book, which further explored the region through interviews and images photographed by Hiro Narita. Produced by Travelfilm Company and adapted by Carra, the film won numerous awards, including Best Documentary at the Hawaii International Film Festival (1991) and the Earthwatch Film Award. It screened at the Sundance Film Festival in 1992.

Koushun Takami&#x27;s novel &quot;Battle Royale&quot; took place on a fictional island in the Seto Inland Sea.

A critical plot element of the Japanese series &quot;Fafner in the Azure&quot; is an alien life form discovered at the bottom of this sea known as the Seto Inland Sea Mir.

Author and literary critic Amy Chavez&#x27;s &quot;The Widow, the Priest and the Octopus Hunter: Discovering a Lost Way of Life on a Secluded Japanese Island&quot; is an account of the author&#x27;s firsthand experience living among and interacting with the residents of Shiraishi.

<text>Larry Dixon (born July 28, 1966) is an American fantasy artist and novelist.

==Background==
Dixon, the son of a Delta Force career commando, studied at The North Carolina School of the Arts and at Savannah College of Art &amp; Design. In 1992, he married fantasy author Mercedes Lackey; they live in the Tulsa, Oklahoma area. Dixon, a sports car enthusiast, is also a storm spotter and volunteer firefighter.

==Writing==
Larry has collaborated with his wife, Mercedes Lackey, on a number of her books, including:

*&quot;Storm Breaking&quot; (illustrator)
*The &quot;Mage Wars&quot; Trilogy (DAW)
**&quot;The Black Gryphon&quot; (co-author)
**&quot;The White Gryphon&quot; (co-author)
**&quot;The Silver Gryphon&quot; (co-author)
*The &quot;SERRAted Edge&quot; Novels (Baen)
**&quot;Chrome Circle&quot; (co-author)
**&quot;Born to Run&quot; (co-author)
*The Owl Trilogy (DAW)
**&quot;Owlflight&quot;
**&quot;Owlsight&quot; (co-author)
**&quot;Owlknight&quot; (co-author)

==Artwork==
Dixon has contributed artwork to several roleplaying games, including &quot;GURPS&quot; and &quot;Talislanta&quot;, and to Wizards of the Coast&#x27;s &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; source books, including &quot;Oriental Adventures&quot;, &quot;Epic Level Handbook&quot;, and &quot;Fiend Folio&quot;. His skill with depicting birds of prey has often led to commissions with the United States Military and with Save Our American Raptors, an organization devoted to raptor rehabilitation.

==Other work==
As a birds-of-prey rehabilitation specialist, Dixon, along with Lackey, has returned over four hundred hawks, owls, falcons and corbies into the wild.

Dixon&#x27;s wildlife rehabilitation led to a minor role in the creation of the digital effects for the giant eagles in the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; movies. Dixon took digital photographs of a stuffed golden eagle he is currently keeping for its owner, a local tribal elder. These photographs, along with castings of the beak and talons, were sent to Weta Digital in New Zealand to provide texture mapping for the digital model for Gwaihir and the other great eagles of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth.

Guest of Honor appearances include:

* CrackerCon (1992)
* ICON 17 (1992)

<doc id="335765" wikidata="Q920562" url="?curid=335765" title="Gator Bowl">
<text>The Gator Bowl is an annual college football bowl game held in Jacksonville, Florida, usually contested on or around New Year&#x27;s Day. It has been held continuously since 1946, making it the sixth oldest college bowl, as well as the first televised nationally. The game was originally played at Gator Bowl Stadium through the December 1993 game. The December 1994 game was played at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium in Gainesville after the namesake stadium was demolished to make way for a replacement venue, Jacksonville Municipal Stadium. That venue, now known as EverBank Stadium, has been home to the Gator Bowl since the January 1996 game.

The game is operated by Gator Bowl Sports and has been sponsored by TaxSlayer.com since 2012, and starting with the 2018 edition is officially known as the &quot;TaxSlayer Gator Bowl&quot;. From 2015 to 2017, it was officially referred to as simply the &quot;TaxSlayer Bowl&quot;. Previous sponsors include Progressive Insurance (2011), Konica Minolta (2008–2010), Toyota (1995–2007), Outback Steakhouse (1992–1994), and Mazda (1986–1991).

==History==
According to writer Anthony C. DiMarco, Charles Hilty Sr. first conceived of the event. Hilty, together with Ray McCarthy, Maurice Cherry, and W. C. Ivey, put up $10,000 to underwrite the first game, which was held at Jacksonville&#x27;s football stadium, Fairfield Stadium, on January 1, 1946.

The first two years of the event did not sell out the small capacity stadium, drawing only 7,362 to the 1946 game when the Wake Forest Demon Deacons defeated the South Carolina Gamecocks, 26–14. The stadium was expanded in 1948 and renamed the Gator Bowl Stadium in honor of the event. However, it was not until the 1949 matchup between the Clemson Tigers and the Missouri Tigers that the future of the Gator Bowl was assured: the 1948 attendance of 16,666 for a 20–20 tie between Maryland and Georgia was nearly doubled with 32,939 watching Clemson squeak by Missouri, 24–23, on a late field goal by Jack Miller.

By the 1970s, the attendance regularly reached 60,000–70,000.

===Hotel Roosevelt fire in 1963===

The Gator Bowl is one of Jacksonville&#x27;s annual sports highlights. However, the event was once associated with a tragedy. In the early morning of December 29, 1963, the Hotel Roosevelt in downtown Jacksonville caught fire after a post-Gator Bowl party in the ballroom. It was later determined that the party was not the cause of the fire, and that the timing was a coincidence. The fire resulted in 22 deaths.

===Woody Hayes incident in 1978===

In the 1978 game between Ohio State and Clemson, Ohio State coach Woody Hayes lost his temper after a late game interception by Clemson nose guard Charlie Bauman, who stepped in front of the receiver on a pass from quarterback Art Schlichter. Bauman ran the ball out of bounds on the Ohio State sideline where Hayes struck Bauman with his right forearm. The play sealed the Tigers&#x27; 17–15 win over the Buckeyes, while Hayes was fired the next day before leaving Jacksonville.

===Bowden&#x27;s Last Stand in 2010===
In the 2010 game between Florida State and West Virginia, Florida State coach Bobby Bowden (who previously coached at West Virginia) coached the final game of his career. Bowden had been the head coach at Florida State since 1976 and had won two national championships, 13 ACC championships, and had a 14-year streak of top five finishes during that time. A record crowd of over 84,000 people witnessed Bowden being carried off the field after a 33–21 Florida State victory.

===TaxSlayer sponsorship===

In 2014, Gator Bowl Sports announced the bowl would be renamed the TaxSlayer Bowl following a new six-year deal with tax preparation company TaxSlayer.com. As a result of the deal, the bowl increased its payout and moved to a new time slot on January 2 for 2015 and 2016. A new logo was released on April 3, 2014. For the December 2018 contest, &quot;Gator&quot; was reinstated in the name for the first time since 2015, with the bowl being called the TaxSlayer Gator Bowl.

==Venues==
The 1946 and 1947 games were played in Fairfield Stadium, which had a seating capacity of 7,600. The stadium was expanded to 16,000 seats in 1948, and the structure was renamed the Gator Bowl. Prior to the 1949 game, the seating capacity was expanded to 36,058, at which it remained until 1957. That stadium hosted the game through 1993, when it was almost completely demolished for the construction of Jacksonville Municipal Stadium on the same site. During construction, the December 1994 game was played at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium in Gainesville, Florida. The January 1996 game, and all subsequent games to date, have been held at Jacksonville Municipal Stadium, currently known as EverBank Stadium.

==Organization==
The game and associated activities are overseen by Gator Bowl Sports. Founded as the Gator Bowl Association in 1945, the organization expanded in 2013 to branch into other sports and events and increase its charity wing.

The association comprises 225 Gator Bowl Committee members, 84 Chairman&#x27;s Club members and sponsors, more than 700 volunteers, plus over a dozen paid staff members. In addition to the Gator Bowl, the GBA has also coordinated other events. It hosted the ACC Championship Game from 2005 to 2007 and the River City Showdown, a neutral site game between the Florida State Seminoles and another team, in 2007 and 2008.

==Teams typically featured==

In the early years of the bowl, from 1946–1952, it featured a team from the Southern Conference against an at-large opponent. Beginning with the 1953 game, it switched to generally featuring a Southeastern Conference (SEC) team against an at-large opponent. From 1953 to the 1975 game, at least one SEC team appeared in 20 out of the 24 games, and in three of those games both teams were from the SEC. The games from 1976 to 1995 usually, but not always, involved a team from the southeastern United States against a team from another part of the country. Teams from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) played in ten of these 20 games.

From 1996–2006, the Gator Bowl traditionally hosted the second-place ACC team against the second-place Big East Conference team. With the 2007 game, the ACC runner-up became contractually tied to play in the Chick-fil-A Bowl and the Gator Bowl began hosting the third-place ACC team versus a team from either the Big East (still the conference&#x27;s #2 team unless they qualified for the Bowl Championship Series), the Big 12 Conference, or the unaffiliated Notre Dame Fighting Irish (who would take the Big East&#x27;s spot in this game). The contract, which ran for four years, was held in conjunction with the Sun Bowl, with the Gator Bowl receiving first choice of teams, and required both bowls to take Big East teams twice and Big 12 teams twice. Since the previous two Gator Bowls featured the Texas Tech Red Raiders and the Nebraska Cornhuskers, both Big 12 teams, a Big East team or Notre Dame would play in the 2010 Gator Bowl per the terms of the contract (West Virginia lost to Florida State in this game).

The conference alignment changed again in 2010, as the Big East and Notre Dame moved their hybrid arrangement to the Champs Sports Bowl for 2010, while the Gator Bowl declined to renew its contract with the Big 12. The Gator Bowl would feature the SEC and the Big Ten Conference starting with the 2010 season, joining the Capital One Bowl and the Outback Bowl as the third Big Ten-SEC bowl matchup on New Year&#x27;s Day. Starting in 2015, the bowl returned to a hybrid arrangement for a six-year period, with SEC teams playing ACC teams for three years and Big Ten teams the other three years; the Notre Dame Fighting Irish are also eligible during ACC years.

Through 74 playings (the 2018 edition), 38 have been contested with both teams ranked (per the AP Poll), most recently the 2006 edition. The highest ranked team to appear was No. 3 Pittsburgh in the 1980 edition.

==Title sponsors==
Mazda was the first title sponsor, beginning in 1986 and lasting for five years. Outback Steakhouse sponsored the Gator Bowl for three years beginning in 1992, prior to obtaining their own Outback Bowl held in Tampa, Florida. From 1996–2006, the title sponsor was Toyota. Konica Minolta then became the sponsor from 2007 to 2010. On December 14, 2010, the Gator Bowl Association announced that Progressive Insurance would become the title sponsor for the 2011 Gator Bowl. On September 1, 2011, GBA announced a multi-year title sponsorship deal with TaxSlayer.com.

<doc id="335766" wikidata="Q119981" url="?curid=335766" title="Software bloat">
<text>Software bloat is a process whereby successive versions of a computer program become perceptibly slower, use more memory, disk space or processing power, or have higher hardware requirements than the previous version, while making only dubious user-perceptible improvements or suffering from feature creep. The term is not applied consistently; it is often used as a pejorative by end users, including to describe undesired user interface changes even if those changes had little or no effect on the hardware requirements. In long-lived software, perceived bloat can occur from the software servicing a large, diverse marketplace with many differing requirements. Most end users will feel they only need some limited subset of the available functions, and will regard the others as unnecessary bloat, even if end users with different requirements require those functions.

Actual (measurable) bloat can occur due to de-emphasising algorithmic efficiency in favour of other concerns like developer productivity, or possibly through the introduction of new layers of abstraction like a virtual machine or other scripting engine for the purposes of convenience when developer constraints are reduced. The perception of improved developer productivity, in the case of practising development within virtual machine environments, comes from the developers no longer taking resource constraints and usage into consideration during design and development; this allows the product to be completed faster but it results in increases to the end user&#x27;s hardware requirements and/or compromised performance as a result.

The term &quot;bloatware&quot; is also used to describe unwanted pre-installed software or bundled programs.

==Types of bloat==
===Program bloat===

In computer programming, code bloat refers to the presence of program code (source code or machine code) that is perceived as unnecessarily long, slow, or otherwise wasteful of resources.

===Feature creep===

Feature creep is the tendency for a product, project, or system to gradually expand beyond its original scope by adding more and more features over time. In the context of computer programs, this can result in excessive disk space usage, loss of performance and the program being harder to use and understand by most end users.

==Causes==
===Software inefficiency===
Software developers involved in the industry during the 1970s had severe limitations on processing power, disk space and memory. Every byte and clock cycle was taken into account, and much work went into fitting the programs into available resources. Achieving this efficiency was one of the highest values of computer programmers, and the best programs were often called &quot;elegant&quot;, a term used by mathematicians to describe a proof which is tidy, parsimonious and powerful.

By the 21st century, the situation had reversed. Resources were perceived as cheap, and rapidity of coding and headline features for marketing seen as priorities. In part, this is because technological advances have since increased processing capacity and storage density by orders of magnitude, while reducing the relative costs by similar orders of magnitude (see Moore&#x27;s law). Additionally, the spread of computers through all levels of business and home life has produced a software industry many times larger than it was in the 1970s. Programs are now usually churned out by teams, directed by committees in software development studios (also known as software houses or software factories) where each programmer works on only a part of the whole, on one or more subroutines.

Finally, software development tools and approaches often result in changes throughout a program to accommodate each feature, leading to a large-scale inclusion of code which affects the main operation of the software, and is required in order to support functions that themselves may be only rarely used. In particular, the advances in resources available have led to tools which allow easier development of code, again with less priority given to end efficiency.

Another cause of bloat is independently competing standards and products, which can create a demand for integration. There are now more operating systems, browsers, protocols, and storage formats than there were before, causing bloat in programs due to interoperability issues. For example, a program that once could only save in text format is now required to save in HTML, XML, XLS, CSV, PDF, DOC, and other formats.

Niklaus Wirth has summed up the situation in Wirth&#x27;s law, which states that software speed is decreasing more quickly than hardware speed is increasing.

In his 2001 essay &quot;Strategy Letter IV: Bloatware and the 80/20 Myth&quot;, Joel Spolsky argues that while 80% of the users only use 20% of the features (a variant on the Pareto principle), each one uses different features. Thus, &quot;lite&quot; software editions turn out to be useless for most, as they miss the one or two special features that are present in the &quot;bloated&quot; version. Spolsky sums the article with a quote by Jamie Zawinski referring to the Mozilla Application Suite (which later became SeaMonkey):

&quot;Convenient though it would be if it were true, Mozilla is not big because it&#x27;s full of useless crap. Mozilla is big because your needs are big. Your needs are big because the Internet is big. There are lots of small, lean web browsers out there that, incidentally, do almost nothing useful. [...] But being a shining jewel of perfection was not a goal when we wrote Mozilla.&quot;

Software bloat may also be a symptom of the second-system effect, described by Fred Brooks in &quot;The Mythical Man-Month.&quot;

===Bloatware===
“Bloatware&quot; is software that has become bloated through inefficiency or accretion of features as outlined above. The term is also commonly used for preinstalled software bundled on a device, usually by the hardware manufacturer, that is mostly unwanted by the purchaser.

The term may also be applied to the accumulation of unwanted and unused software elements that remain after partial and incomplete uninstallation. These elements may include whole programs, libraries, associated configuration information, or other data. Performance may deteriorate overall as a result of such remnants, as the unwanted software or software components can occupy both hard disk memory and RAM, waste processing time, add disk I/O, and cause delays at system startup and shutdown. In the worst cases, the leftover software may interfere with the correct operation of wanted software.

On Android devices some of the bloatware can be hidden from a user account with ADB, although this doesn&#x27;t remove the application and will still take disk space, it won&#x27;t run and slow down the system. By unlocking the bootloader, users can remove the bloatware&#x27;s files, install a custom firmware or gain root privileges which allows the app to be fully uninstalled.

==Examples==
Apple&#x27;s iTunes has been accused of being bloated by efforts to turn it from a simple media player to an e-commerce and advertising platform, with former &quot;PC World&quot; editor Ed Bott accusing the company of hypocrisy in its advertising attacks on Windows for similar practices. In 2019, Apple announced the impending closure of the program, a move described by a commentator from &quot;The Guardian&quot; as being &quot;long overdue&quot;, stating that the program had &quot;become baroquely bloated, a striking anomaly for a company that prides itself on elegant and functional design.&quot;

Microsoft Windows has also been criticized as being bloated – with reference to Windows Vista and discussing the new, greatly slimmed down Windows 7 core components, Microsoft engineer Eric Traut commented that &quot;This is the core of Windows 7. This is a collection of components that we&#x27;ve taken out. A lot of people think of Windows as this really large, bloated operating system, and that may be a fair characterization, I have to admit. It is large. It contains a lot of stuff in it. But at its core, the kernel and the components that make up the very core of the operating system actually is pretty streamlined.&quot; Ed Bott also expressed skepticism, noting that nearly every operating system that Microsoft has ever sold has been criticized as &quot;bloated&quot; on first release, even those now regarded as the exact opposite, such as MS-DOS. Quoting Paul Thurrott, Bott agreed that the bloat stems from numerous enterprise-level features included in the operating system that were largely irrelevant to the average home user.

CD- and DVD-burning applications such as Nero Burning ROM have become criticized for being bloated. Superfluous features not specifically tailored to the end user are sometimes installed by default through express setups.

A number of technology blogs have also covered the issue of increased bloatware on cell phones. However, they refer to a different issue, specifically that of wireless carriers loading phones with software that, in many cases, cannot be easily, if at all, deleted. This has been most frequently cited with respect to Android devices, although this phenomenon exists on phones running many other operating systems.

Some of the most popular current messaging apps, which were previously only focused on instant messaging, have been criticized for being bloated due to feature creep. WeChat during its transformation into a super-app added additional features such as games, subscription services, WeChat Pay e-wallet, a news aggregator, an e-commerce hub, an e-government feature, a cinema booking system, a restaurant finder and a ridesharing company, which has increased the size of the app from 2 MB in 2011 to 58 MB in 2018. Facebook Messenger, which has been separated from the Facebook app, is similarly criticized for adding additional features such as games, bots and features which copied from Snapchat such as Messenger Day (Stories), face filters, a camera with the ability to edit photos, doodle draw and added emojis and stickers. In January 2018, the head of Facebook Messaging, David A. Marcus, admitted that the app itself is extremely bloated and promised to redesign the whole app to remove unnecessary features and streamline it. The redesigned and streamlined Facebook Messenger app was announced in October 2018, in which its features are reduced to messaging, stories, discover tab and camera.

==Alternatives==

Some applications, such as GIMP, and software with additional functionality from plug-ins, use extensions or add-ons which are downloaded separately from the main application. These can be created by either the software developer or by third-party developers. Plug-ins, extensions, and add-ons add extra functionality which might have otherwise been packaged in the main program.

Allowing these plug-ins, extensions, and/or add-ons reduces the space used on any one machine, because even though the application, the &quot;plug-in interface&quot;, and all the plug-ins combined are larger than the same functionality compiled into one monolithic application, it allows each user to install only the particular add-on features they require, rather than forcing every user to install a much larger monolithic application that includes all of the available features. This results in a &quot;stripped-down&quot; or &quot;out-of-the-box&quot; application that is delivered in a compact package yet is ready for users to add any missing functionality.

Open source software may use a similar technique using preprocessor directives to include features at compile time selectively. This is easier to implement and more secure than a plugin system, but has the disadvantage that a user who wants a specific set of features must compile the program from source.

Sometimes software becomes bloated because of &quot;creeping featurism&quot; (Zawinski&#x27;s law of software envelopment). One way to reduce that kind of bloat is described by the Unix philosophy of &quot;writing programs that do one thing and do it well,&quot; and breaking what would be a single, complicated piece of software into numerous simpler components which can be chained together using pipes, shell scripts, or other forms of interapplication communication.

==Security Risk==
===Software bloat as a vulnerability===
Software bloat may induce more vulnerabilities due to raise of difficulty in managing a large number of code and dependencies. Furthermore, it may make software developer difficulty to understand the code they ship, increasing the difficulty for spot and fix vulnerabilities.

=== Bloatware as a vulnerability ===
Although bloatware is not a form of malware and is not designed for malicious purposes, bloatware may introduce some vulnerabilities unintentionally and may cause the user&#x27;s computer to have a higher risk for infection by computer viruses or ransomware.

<text>The French Revolution of 1830, also known as the July Revolution (), Second French Revolution, or  (&quot;Three Glorious [Days]&quot;), was a second French Revolution after the first in 1789. It led to the overthrow of King Charles X, the French Bourbon monarch, and the ascent of his cousin Louis Philippe, Duke of Orléans. After 18 precarious years on the throne, Louis-Philippe was overthrown in the French Revolution of 1848.

The 1830 Revolution marked a shift from one constitutional monarchy, under the restored House of Bourbon, to another, the July Monarchy; the transition of power from the House of Bourbon to its cadet branch, the House of Orléans; and the replacement of the principle of hereditary right by that of popular sovereignty. Supporters of the Bourbons would be called Legitimists, and supporters of Louis Philippe were known as Orléanists. In addition, there continued to be Bonapartists supporting the return of Napoleon&#x27;s descendants.

== Background ==
After Napoleonic France&#x27;s defeat and surrender in May 1814, Continental Europe, and France in particular, was in a state of disarray. The Congress of Vienna met to redraw the continent&#x27;s political map. Many European countries attended the Congress, but decision-making was controlled by four major powers: the Austrian Empire, represented by the Chief Minister Prince Metternich; the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, represented by its Foreign Secretary Viscount Castlereagh; the Russian Empire, represented by Emperor Alexander I; and Prussia, represented by King Frederick William III.

France&#x27;s foreign minister, Charles Maurice de Talleyrand, also attended the Congress. Although France was considered an enemy state, Talleyrand was allowed to attend the Congress because he claimed that he had only cooperated with Napoleon under duress. He suggested that France be restored to her &quot;legitimate&quot; (i.e. pre-Napoleonic) borders and governments—a plan that, with some changes, was accepted by the major powers. France was spared large annexations and returned to its 1791 borders. The House of Bourbon, deposed by the Revolution, was restored to the throne in the person of Louis XVIII. The Congress, however, forced Louis to grant a constitution, the Charter of 1814.

=== Charles X&#x27;s reign ===

On 16 September 1824, after a lingering illness of several months, the 68-year-old Louis XVIII died. As he was childless, his younger brother, Charles, aged 66, inherited the throne of France. He was known to have more reactionary politics. On 27 September Charles X made his state entry into Paris to popular acclaim. During the ceremony, while presenting the King the keys to the city, the comte de Chabrol, Prefect of the Seine, declared: &quot;Proud to possess its new king, Paris can aspire to become the queen of cities by its magnificence, as its people aspire to be foremost in its fidelity, its devotion, and its love.&quot;

Eight months later, the mood of the capital had sharply worsened in its opinion of the new king. The causes of this dramatic shift in public opinion were many, but the main two were:
* Imposition of the death penalty for anyone profaning the Eucharist (see Anti-Sacrilege Act).
* The provisions for financial indemnities for properties confiscated by the 1789 Revolution and the First Empire of Napoleon—these indemnities to be paid to anyone, whether noble or non-noble, who had been declared &quot;enemies of the revolution.&quot;
Critics of the first accused the king and his new ministry of pandering to the Catholic Church, and by so doing of violating guarantees of equality of religious belief as specified in the Charter of 1814.

The second matter, that of financial indemnities, was far more opportunistic than the first. Since the restoration of the monarchy, there had been demands from all groups to settle matters of property ownership in order to reduce, if not eliminate, the uncertainties in the real estate market. But opponents, many of whom were frustrated Bonapartists, began a whispering campaign that Charles X was proposing this action in order to shame those opponents who had not left the country. Both measures, they claimed, were nothing more than clever subterfuge meant to bring about the destruction of the Charter of 1814.

Up to this time, thanks to the popularity of the constitution and the Chamber of Deputies with the people of Paris, the king&#x27;s relationship with the élite—both the Bourbon supporters and Bourbon opposition—had remained solid. This, too, was about to change. On 12 April, propelled by both genuine conviction and the spirit of independence, the Chamber of Deputies roundly rejected the government&#x27;s proposal to change the inheritance laws. The popular newspaper &quot;Le Constitutionnel&quot; pronounced this refusal &quot;a victory over the forces of counter-revolutionaries and reactionism.&quot;

The popularity of both the Chamber of Peers and the Chamber of Deputies skyrocketed, and the popularity of the king and his ministry dropped. The Coronation of Charles took place at Reims Cathedral on 29 May 1825. In an elaborate ceremony the King swore both to uphold the Charter but also France&#x27;s ancient &quot;fundamental laws&quot;.

On 16 April 1827, while reviewing the &quot;Garde Royale&quot; in the Champ de Mars, the king was greeted with icy silence, and many of the spectators refused to remove their hats, the traditional sign of respect for the king. Charles X &quot;later told [his cousin] Orléans that, &#x27;although most people present were not too hostile, some looked at times with terrible expressions&#x27;.&quot;

Because of what Charles X&#x27;s government perceived to be growing, relentless, and increasingly vitriolic criticism of both the government and the Church, it introduced a proposal at the Chamber of Deputies for a law to tighten censorship, especially of newspapers. The Chamber, for its part, objected so violently that the humiliated government had no choice but to withdraw its proposals.

On 30 April, on the grounds that it had behaved in an offensive manner towards the crown, the king abruptly dissolved the National Guard of Paris, a voluntary group of citizens formerly considered a reliable conduit between the monarchy and the people. Cooler heads were appalled: &quot;[I] would rather have my head cut off&quot;, wrote a nobleman from the Rhineland upon hearing the news, &quot;than have counseled such an act: the only further measure needed to cause a revolution is censorship.&quot;

On 17 March 1830, the majority in the Chamber of Deputies passed a motion of no confidence, the Address of the 221, against the king and Polignac&#x27;s ministry. The following day, Charles dissolved parliament, and alarmed the opposition by delaying elections for two months. During this time, the liberals championed the &quot;221&quot; as popular heroes, while the government struggled to gain support across the country, as prefects were shuffled around the departments of France. The elections that followed, taking place between 5 and 19 July 1830, returned a narrow majority for Polignac and his Ultra-royalists, but many Chamber members were nevertheless hostile to the king.

On Sunday, 25 July 1830, the king, with the agreement of Polignac, set out to alter the Charter of 1814 by decree. His decrees, known as the July Ordinances, dissolved the Chamber of Deputies, suspended the liberty of the press, excluded the commercial middle class from future elections, and called for new elections. On Monday 26 July, these decrees were published in the leading conservative newspaper in Paris, &quot;Le Moniteur&quot;. On Tuesday 27 July, a revolution began in earnest , and ultimately ended the Bourbon monarchy.

== The Three Glorious Days ==
=== Monday, 26 July 1830 ===
It was a hot, dry summer, pushing those who could afford it to leave Paris for the country. Most businessmen could not, and so were among the first to learn of the Saint-Cloud &quot;Ordinances&quot;, which banned them from running as candidates for the Chamber of Deputies. Such membership was indispensable to those who sought the ultimate in social prestige. In protest, members of the &quot;Bourse&quot; refused to lend money, and business owners shuttered their factories. Workers were unceremoniously turned out into the street to fend for themselves. Unemployment, which had been growing through early summer, spiked. &quot;Large numbers of... workers therefore had nothing to do but protest.&quot;

While newspapers such as the &quot;Journal des débats&quot;, &quot;Le Moniteur&quot;, and &quot;Le Constitutionnel&quot; had already ceased publication in compliance with the new law, nearly 50 journalists from a dozen city newspapers met in the offices of &quot;Le National&quot;. There they signed a collective protest, and vowed their newspapers would continue to run.

That evening, when police raided a news press and seized contraband newspapers, they were greeted by a sweltering, unemployed mob angrily shouting, &quot;À bas les Bourbons!&quot; (&quot;Down with the Bourbons!&quot;) and &quot;Vive la Charte!&quot; (&quot;Long live the Charter!&quot;).

Armand Carrel, a journalist, wrote in the next day&#x27;s edition of &quot;Le National&quot;:
France... falls back into revolution by the act of the government itself... the legal regime is now interrupted, that of force has begun... in the situation in which we are now placed obedience has ceased to be a duty... It is for France to judge how far its own resistance ought to extend.

Despite public anger over the police raid, Jean-Henri-Claude Magin, the Paris &quot;Préfet de police&quot;, wrote that evening: &quot;the most perfect tranquility continues to reign in all parts of the capital. No event worthy of attention is recorded in the reports that have come through to me.&quot;

=== Tuesday, 27 July 1830: Day One ===

Throughout the day, Paris grew quiet as the milling crowds grew larger. At 4:30 pm commanders of the troops of the First Military division of Paris and the &quot;Garde Royale&quot; were ordered to concentrate their troops, and guns, on the Place du Carrousel facing the Tuileries, the Place Vendôme, and the Place de la Bastille. In order to maintain order and protect gun shops from looters, military patrols throughout the city were established, strengthened, and expanded. However, no special measures were taken to protect either the arm depots or gunpowder factories. For a time, those precautions seemed premature, but at 7:00 pm, with the coming of twilight, the fighting began. &quot;Parisians, rather than soldiers, were the aggressor. Paving stones, roof tiles, and flowerpots from the upper windows... began to rain down on the soldiers in the streets&quot;. At first, soldiers fired warning shots into the air. But before the night was over, twenty-one civilians were killed. Rioters then paraded the corpse of one of their fallen throughout the streets shouting &quot;&quot;Mort aux Ministres!&quot; &quot;À bas les aristocrates!&quot;&quot; (&quot;Death to the ministers! Down with the aristocrats!&quot;)

One witness wrote:
[I saw] a crowd of agitated people pass by and disappear, then a troop of cavalry succeed them... In every direction and at intervals... Indistinct noises, gunshots, and then for a time all is silent again so for a time one could believe that everything in the city was normal. But all the shops are shut; the Pont Neuf is almost completely dark, the stupefaction visible on every face reminds us all too much of the crisis we face...
In 1828, the city of Paris had installed some 2,000 street lamps. These lanterns were hung on ropes looped-on-looped from one pole to another, as opposed to being secured on posts. The rioting lasted well into the night until most of them had been destroyed by 10:00 PM, forcing the crowds to slip away.

=== Wednesday, 28 July 1830: Day Two ===

Fighting in Paris continued throughout the night. One eyewitness wrote:

It is hardly a quarter past eight, and already shouts and gun shots can be heard. Business is at a complete standstill... Crowds rushing through the streets... the sound of cannon and gunfire is becoming ever louder... Cries of &quot;&quot;À bas le roi !&quot;, &quot;À la guillotine !!&quot;&quot; [&quot;Down with the king!&quot;, &quot;To the guillotine!!&quot;] can be heard...

Charles X ordered Maréchal Auguste Marmont, Duke of Ragusa, the on-duty Major-General of the &quot;Garde Royale&quot;, to repress the disturbances. Marmont was personally liberal, and opposed to the ministry&#x27;s policy, but was bound tightly to the King because he believed such to be his duty; and possibly because of his unpopularity for his generally perceived and widely criticized desertion of Napoleon in 1814. The king remained at Saint-Cloud, but was kept abreast of the events in Paris by his ministers, who insisted that the troubles would end as soon as the rioters ran out of ammunition.

Marmont&#x27;s plan was to have the &quot;Garde Royale&quot; and available line units of the city garrison guard the vital thoroughfares and bridges of the city, as well as protect important buildings such as the Palais Royal, Palais de Justice, and the Hôtel de Ville. This plan was both ill-considered and wildly ambitious; not only were there not enough troops, but there were also nowhere near enough provisions. The &quot;Garde Royale&quot; was mostly loyal for the moment, but the attached line units were wavering: a small but growing number of troops were deserting; some merely slipping away, others leaving, not caring who saw them.

In Paris, a committee of the Bourbon opposition, composed of banker-and-kingmaker Jacques Laffitte, Casimir Perier, Generals Étienne Gérard and Georges Mouton, comte de Lobau, among others, had drawn up and signed a petition in which they asked for the &quot;ordonnances&quot; to be withdrawn. The petition was critical &quot;not of the King, but his ministers&quot;, thereby countering the conviction of Charles X that his liberal opponents were enemies of his dynasty.

After signing the petition, committee members went directly to Marmont to beg for an end to the bloodshed, and to plead with him to become a mediator between Saint-Cloud and Paris. Marmont acknowledged the petition, but stated that the people of Paris would have to lay down arms first for a settlement to be reached. Discouraged but not despairing, the party then sought out the king&#x27;s chief minister, de Polignac – &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc en culottes&quot;. From Polignac they received even less satisfaction. He refused to see them, perhaps because he knew that discussions would be a waste of time. Like Marmont, he knew that Charles X considered the &quot;ordonnances&quot; vital to the safety and dignity of the throne of France. Thus, the King would not withdraw the &quot;ordonnances&quot;.

At 4 pm, Charles X received Colonel Komierowski, one of Marmont&#x27;s chief aides. The colonel was carrying a note from Marmont to his Majesty:

Sire, it is no longer a riot, it is a revolution. It is urgent for Your Majesty to take measures for pacification. The honour of the crown can still be saved. Tomorrow, perhaps, there will be no more time... I await with impatience Your Majesty&#x27;s orders.

The king asked Polignac for advice, and the advice was to resist.

=== Thursday, 29 July 1830: Day Three ===
&quot;They (the king and ministers) do not come to Paris&quot;, wrote the poet, novelist and playwright Alfred de Vigny, &quot;people are dying for them ... Not one prince has appeared. The poor men of the guard abandoned without orders, without bread for two days, hunted everywhere and fighting.&quot;

Perhaps for the same reason, royalists were nowhere to be found; perhaps another reason was that now the &quot;révoltés&quot; were well organized and very well armed. In only a day and a night, over 4,000 barricades had been thrown up throughout the city. The tricolor flag of the revolutionaries – the &quot;people&#x27;s flag&quot; – flew over buildings, an increasing number of them important buildings.

Marmont lacked either the initiative or the presence of mind to call for additional troops from Saint-Denis, Vincennes, Lunéville, or Saint-Omer; neither did he ask for help from reservists or those Parisians still loyal to Charles X. The Bourbon opposition and supporters of the July Revolution swarmed to his headquarters demanding the arrest of Polignac and the other ministers, while supporters of the Bourbon and city leaders demanded he arrest the rioters and their puppet masters. Marmont refused to act on either request, instead awaiting orders from the king.

By 1:30 pm, the Tuileries Palace had been sacked. A man wearing a ball dress belonging to the duchesse de Berry, the king&#x27;s widowed daughter in law and the mother of the heir to the throne, with feathers and flowers in his hair, screamed from a palace window: &quot;&#x27;Je reçois! Je reçois!&quot;&#x27; (&#x27;I receive! I receive!&#x27;) Others drank wine from the palace cellars.&quot; Earlier that day, the Louvre had fallen, even more quickly. Swiss troops of the Royal Army, confronted by the mob and under orders from Marmont not to fire unless fired upon, were withdrawn by their officers who feared a repetition of the massacre of Swiss Guards that had occurred when the Tuileries had been stormed on 10 August 1792.

By mid-afternoon, the greatest prize, the Hôtel de Ville, had been captured. The amount of looting during these three days was surprisingly small; not only at the Louvre—whose paintings and &quot;objets d&#x27;art&quot; were protected by the crowd—but the Tuileries, the Palais de Justice, the Archbishop&#x27;s Palace, and other places as well.

A few hours later, politicians entered the battered complex and set about establishing a provisional government. Though there would be spots of fighting throughout the city for the next few days, the revolution, for all intents and purposes, was over.

== Result ==
The revolution of July 1830 created another constitutional monarchy. On 2 August, Charles X and his son the Dauphin abdicated their rights to the throne and departed for Great Britain. Although Charles had intended that his grandson, the Duke of Bordeaux, would take the throne as Henry V, the politicians who composed the provisional government instead placed on the throne a distant cousin, Louis Philippe of the House of Orléans, who agreed to rule as a constitutional monarch. This period became known as the July Monarchy. Supporters of the exiled senior line of the Bourbon dynasty became known as Legitimists.

The July Column, located on Place de la Bastille, commemorates the events of the Three Glorious Days.

This renewed French Revolution sparked an August uprising in Brussels and the Southern Provinces of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, leading to separation and the establishment of the Kingdom of Belgium. There was also a successful revolution in Brunswick. The example of the July Revolution also inspired unsuccessful revolutions in Italy and the November Uprising in Poland.

Two years later, Parisian republicans, disillusioned by the outcome and underlying motives of the uprising, revolted in an event known as the June Rebellion. Although the insurrection was crushed within less than a week, the July Monarchy remained doubtfully popular, disliked for different reasons by both Right and Left, and was eventually overthrown in 1848.

<text>Ruthin ( ; ) is a market town and community in Denbighshire, Wales, in the south of the Vale of Clwyd. It is Denbighshire&#x27;s county town. The town, castle and St Peter&#x27;s Square lie on a hill, skirted by villages such as Pwllglas and Rhewl. The name comes from the Welsh &quot;rhudd&quot; (red) and &quot;din&quot; (fort), after the colour of sandstone bedrock, from which the castle was built in 1277–1284. The Old Mill, Ruthin, is nearby. Maen Huail, a registered ancient monument associated with King Arthur and with Hueil mab Caw, the brother of the historian Gildas, stands in St Peter&#x27;s Square.

==Demographics==
The population at the 2001 census was 5,218, of whom 47 per cent were male and 53 per cent female. The average age was 43.0 years and 98.2 per cent were white. According to the 2011 census, the population had risen to 5,461. 68 per cent of which were born in Wales and 25 per cent in England. Welsh speakers account for 42 per cent of the town&#x27;s population. The community includes the village of Llanfwrog.

==History==

There is evidence of Celtic and later Roman settlements in the area. However, little is known of the history of the town before the construction of Ruthin Castle was started in 1277 by Dafydd, the brother of prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd. However, he forfeited the castle when he rebelled against King Edward I with his brother; Edward&#x27;s queen, Eleanor, was in residence in 1281. The original name was &quot;Castell Coch yng Ngwern-fôr&quot; (Red Castle in the Sea Swamps). The Marcher Lord, Reginald de Grey, Justiciar of Chester, was given the &quot;Cantref&quot; (an administrative district) of Deffrencloyt (Dyffryn Clwyd, the Welsh for &quot;Vale of Clwyd&quot;), and his family ran the area for the next 226 years. The third Baron de Grey&#x27;s land dispute with Owain Glyndŵr triggered Glyndŵr&#x27;s rebellion against King Henry IV, which began on 16 September 1400, when Glyndŵr burned Ruthin to the ground, reputedly leaving only the castle and a few other buildings standing.

The Lord de Grey established a Collegiate Church in 1310. Now the Collegiate and Parish Church of St Peter, it dominates the Ruthin skyline. It has a double nave and boasts two medieval carved roofs. These days it is known for its musical tradition. It has a large choir of children and adults and a four-manual Wadsworth-Willis organ. Behind the church can be seen the old college buildings, school and Christ&#x27;s Hospital.

A Ruthin native, Sir Thomas Exmewe was Lord Mayor of the City of London in 1517–1518.

The half-timbered Old Court House (built in 1401), on the square, features the remains of a gibbet last used to execute a Franciscan priest, Charles Meehan, also known as Mahoney. He was shipwrecked on the Welsh coast at a time when Catholicism was equated with treason – Meehan was hanged, drawn, and quartered in 1679. He was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1987 as one of the &quot;Eighty-five martyrs of England and Wales&quot;.

During the English Civil War, the castle survived an eleven-week siege, after which it was demolished by order of Parliament. It was rebuilt in the 19th century as a country house, which has now been turned into the &quot;Ruthin Castle Hotel&quot;. From 1826 until 1921 the castle was the home of the Cornwallis-West family, members of Victorian and Edwardian high society.

In its 18th-century heyday as a town on drovers&#x27; routes from Wales into England, Ruthin was reputed to have &quot;a pub for every week of the year&quot;. By 2007, however, there were only eleven pubs in the town. The public records of 23 October 1891 show 31 such establishments serving a population of 3,186; most have been converted into housing or shops. The Ruthin Union Workhouse was built in 1834.

The first copies of the Welsh national anthem, &quot;Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau&quot;, were printed in what is now the &quot;Siop Nain&quot; tea and gift shop on Well Street.

In 1863 the Denbigh, Ruthin and Corwen Railway, which linked in Denbigh with the Vale of Clwyd Railway (later part of the London and North Western Railway, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, and British Rail) reached the town. The route ran from Rhyl along the north coast through Denbigh and Ruthin to Corwen, before joining a route from Ruabon through Llangollen, Corwen and Bala to Barmouth. The railway and Ruthin railway station closed in 1963 under the Beeching Axe. The site of the station is now occupied by a large road roundabout (Brieg Roundabout) and the Ruthin Craft Centre, which opened in 1982, but was rebuilt and reopened in 2008.

Ruthin hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1868 and 1973. The Urdd National Eisteddfod visited Ruthin in 1992 and 2006.

==Education==
The town&#x27;s principal school is Ysgol Brynhyfryd (Brynhyfryd School), a comprehensive school for 11 to 18 year olds. Its Grade II listed building was built about 1830 as the home of local solicitor, before becoming in 1898 &quot;Ruthin County School for Girls&quot;. (The town&#x27;s boys travelled five miles by train to Denbigh High School.) The school went co-educational in 1938, with feeder junior schools up to around six miles away. Building work in the 1950s and the early 1970s increased the number of pupils from 700 to 1000 in a few years, as the minimum school-leaving age rose from 15 to 16). In 2001–2002 the listed building became the Sixth Form Centre. The school&#x27;s sports facilities, including the swimming pool, are used as the town&#x27;s Leisure Centre. It also features a theatre and arts complex, &quot;Theatr John Ambrose&quot;, named after a headmaster of the school in the 1980s and 1990s. This was opened by the actor Rhys Ifans, a former pupil of Ysgol Pentrecelyn and Ysgol Maes Garmon in Mold, but brought up in Ruthin.
In 1574 Gabriel Goodman re-founded Ruthin School which was founded in 1284, making it one of the oldest private schools in the United Kingdom. In 1590, Goodman established &quot;Christ&#x27;s Hospital&quot; for 12 poor persons around St Peter&#x27;s Church on the square, and was Dean of Westminster for 40 years (1561–1601). Ruthin School is now a co-educational boarding and day school, with 227 pupils overall, 145 of them boarders in 2014. In September 2013, the school bought &quot;Ye Old Anchor&quot;, after its closure as a hotel in November 2012, and converted it into a boarding house for 30 upper sixth-form students.

==Transport==
===Bus===
Ruthin has daytime bus services on Mondays to Saturdays, with the last bus on most routes leaving between 5.30 and 7.30 pm. There is no service on Sundays or public holidays. Routes serving Ruthin are Stagecoach 1 and 2 to Mold (1 via Llanarmon and Llanferres, 2 via Llanarmon, Graianrhyd, and Erryrys), X1 runs three times a day to Chester via Llanferres and Mold – frequency of the buses to Mold varies throughout the day between 30 minutes and 2 hours. Route X51 by Arriva runs basically hourly between Rhyl, St Asaph, Denbigh, Ruthin, and Wrexham (Rhyl bus station is next to the railway station, providing Ruthin&#x27;s most convenient access to the national rail network, while Wrexham railway station is a short distance from its bus station.) Route 55, by Llew Jones Coaches, operates to Corwen at intervals of 50–135 minutes through the day, with three buses extended to Llangollen, and two of these via Llangollen to Wrexham. Route 76, by M &amp; H Coaches, runs six times a day between Denbigh and Ruthin via Llandyrnog, Llangynhafal, and Llanbedr DC; two of these also serve Llanfair DC, Graigfechan, and Pentrecelyn. Less regular services include a weekly route 71 on Fridays between Corwen, Cerrigydrudion, Ruthin, and Morrisons&#x27; supermarket in Denbigh, and route 72 on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for Cyffylliog, Clocaenog, Bontuchel, Betws Gwerfil Goch, Melin-y-Wig, Derwen, and Clawddnewydd. Ruthin town has route 73, operating three buses a day around Ruthin on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.

===Rail===

The Ruthin railway line and station closed in the 1960s. They had connected Ruthin to and to the north and to the south.

In 1858, it was intended to extend the Vale of Clwyd line from Denbigh to Ruthin, running alongside the race-course in the town park (now Parc-y Dre housing) to the Station Hotel. However the West family prevented the line crossing the Castle Park towards Corwen. The route was diverted to the north alongside the road to Wrexham and the Station Hotel renamed the Park Place Hotel. Opposite Station Road lies Railway Terrace, a row of Grade II listed buildings, built in 1864 with evidence of trains running in a cutting in front. The first sod was cut in September 1860 by Mrs Florence West, with an inaugural service starting on St David&#x27;s Day 1862. To mark this, a song was composed with words by T. Ab Gwilym, music by B. Williams and published by Isaac Clarke. The line ran 6.75 miles (10.9 km), with stations at and .

==Sport==
The local football club is Ruthin Town. In rugby union, Clwb Rygbi Rhuthun/Ruthin RFC has several teams: 1st XV, 2nd XV, 3rd XV, Youth, Juniors &amp; Women&#x27;s XV.

On 13 June 1981, Ruthin hosted the Annual General Meeting of the International Football Association Board, the body which determines the laws of football.

Facilities at Ruthin Leisure Centre on Mold Road include a swimming pool, sports hall and fitness suite. Llanfwrog Community Centre on Mwrog Street provides tennis courts, a golf driving range and bowling greens.

===Ruthin Gaol===

The first House of Correction, or &quot;Bridewell&quot;, was built at the bottom of Clwyd Street, next to the river, in 1654, to replace the Old Court House, where able-bodied idlers and the unemployed were sent to work. Following John Howard&#x27;s investigations into prison conditions the Denbighshire justices resolved to build a new model prison in Ruthin on the site of the old Bridewell. Work began in January 1775. In 1802 the prison had four cells for prisoners and nine rooms for debtors. By 1837 it could hold 37 inmates. The Prisons Act of 1865 set new standards for the design of prisons – as the Ruthin County Gaol did not meet the standards, plans were drawn up for a new four-storey wing. The new prison for up to 100 prisoners was built in the style of London&#x27;s Pentonville Prison at a cost of £12,000. On 1 April 1878 the Ruthin County Gaol became HM Prison Ruthin, covering the counties of Denbighshire, Flintshire, and Merionethshire. As far as is known, only one person was ever executed in the prison: William Hughes of Denbigh, aged 42, who was hanged on 17 February 1903 for the murder of his wife, his plea of insanity having failed. Another prison personality was John Jones, known as &quot;Coch Bach y Bala&quot; – who was a kleptomaniac and poacher who had spent more than half his 60 years in all the prisons of north Wales and many in England; he twice escaped from Ruthin Gaol, first on 30 November 1879 when he walked out of prison with three others while the staff were having supper – a £5 reward was offered for his capture, which happened on the following 3 January. On 30 September 1913 he tunnelled out of his cell and using a rope made out of his bedding he climbed over the roof of the chapel and kitchen and got over the wall; after seven days living rough on the Nantclwyd Estate several miles away, Jones was shot in the leg by one of his pursuers, 19-year-old Reginald Jones-Bateman. Jones died of shock and blood loss, while Jones-Bateman was charged with manslaughter, though the charges were subsequently dropped.

Ruthin Gaol ceased to be a prison in 1916, when the prisoners and guards were transferred to Shrewsbury. The County Council bought the buildings in 1926 and used them for offices, the county archives and the town library. During the Second World War they were used as a munitions factory. They were then returned to the County Council and became the headquarters of the Denbighshire Library Service. In 2004 the Gaol was renovated and reopened as a museum.

Most Haunted: Midsummer Murders filmed the series&#x27; fifth episode in Ruthin, where the team investigated a Victorian Era murder. Locations included the Old Gaol and the town library.

===The Craft Centre===

The Craft Centre had ten studios occupied by crafters who could be watched while they worked at glass blowing, ceramic manufacture, painting, furniture restoration, etc. The original Craft Centre was demolished early in 2007, and a new Craft Centre opened in July 2008 in a £4.3 million scheme, which contains six craft workshops, larger galleries and an expanded craft retail gallery, two residency studios, an education space and a tourist information centre, and a restaurant.

===Nantclwyd y Dre===
Nantclwyd y Dre (previously known as Tŷ Nantclwyd), in Castle Street, was built about 1435 by a local merchant Gronw ap Madoc. The building was sold to the county council in 1982, restored from 2004, and opened to the public in 2007. It contains seven rooms which have been restored to represent various periods in the building&#x27;s history. Visitors can also observe a colony of Lesser horseshoe bats in the attic rooms.

Behind the house are two gardens, the 13th-century inner garden and the outer Lord&#x27;s Garden, itself believed to have been part of a 13th-century developed castle garden. Restored in the 18th century, Lord&#x27;s Garden is now itself Grade II listed. In December 2013, the council successfully applied for a grant of £177,600 from the Heritage Lottery Fund, which will see Lord&#x27;s Garden restored and opened to the public by 2015.

===Cae Ddôl===

This is Ruthin&#x27;s main park area, which includes a children&#x27;s play area, a lake, walks and picnic area. A skate park was built in 2007 and a zip wire and trim trail added later. The River Clwyd runs through the park.
===Gŵyl Rhuthun Festival===

Gŵyl Rhuthun Festival was founded in 1994 and has been held annually since 1996. The festival is a week filled with events and performances held in various locations around the town, beginning with Ruthin Carnival. The pinnacle of the festival is the Top of Town event held on Ruthin’s historic town square on the last Saturday of the week.

==Listed buildings==
According to the historian Peter Smith, &quot;Until the 18th century most towns in Wales had many black-and-white houses (such as Tŷ Nantclwyd y Dre). Ruthin is the only example we have left. It should be carefully conserved, as the last memory we have of these towns.&quot; Seven Eyes is a Grade II* listed building of some importance, situated in St Peter&#x27;s Square.

===St Peter&#x27;s Square===
;St Peter&#x27;s Church

St Peter&#x27;s Church is the parish church of Ruthin. It is in the diocese of St Asaph. Parts are as old as 1282.

;&quot;The Myddleton Arms&quot;
The &quot;Myddleton Arms&quot; is also known as the &quot;Seven Eyes&quot;. It is said to have been built in the 14th century. The Dutch style design, long, steeped roof is attributed to Sir Richard Clough, an Elizabethan merchant. It has four tiers of dormer windows, each at a different elevation, known locally as the seven eyes of Ruthin. The property was acquired in 1595 by Sir Hugh Myddleton, who provided London with it first fresh water supply. The view of The Myddleton on the square is in fact of the rear of the building. The front looks out over the Clwydian Hills.

;HSBC Bank
Formerly a confectionery and bakery shop rented by Thomas Trehearne, the property was owned by the Castle estate. The property also served as a chemist&#x27;s shop and later as Dick&#x27;s boot store. On 1 May 1898, Harris Jones took a lease of the property for 21 years as a draper, hosier, glover and dressmaker; he also sold oilcloths, linoleum and other floor coverings. The shop and house were put up for sale in the 1913 by the castle estate along with the &quot;Castle Hotel&quot; and the &quot;Myddleton Arms&quot;, which were purchased by William Owen. His lease expired in 1919 with Jones transferring to what is now Gayla House, where he converted the ground floor from residential to retail premises in 1923. The premises are now owned by the HSBC Bank.

;Exmewe House
Formerly the Beehive, this served for 75 years as general drapery and millinery shop. The exact date of the building is not known, but remains of timber framing with wattle and daub indicate that the building is very old. An advertisement claimed the building had been built before 1397. The main section of the building was demolished to make way for the bank. Ruthin Court Rolls refer to a man named Telemann in Ruthin and to a house &quot;in the high St.&quot; The rolls record that in 1397, Howell de Rowell passed it on to John Le Sergant. Little is known of the family – possibly a retainer of Edward 1st or Reginald de Grey, probably of Norman French descent. On 24 February, Sergant transferred the tenancy to his daughter Sibilia. The property passed to the Exmewe family by the marriage of Sibilia to Richard Exmewe, their son Thomas being Lord Mayor of London in 1517. Little is known of Exmewe family.

Thomas moved to London, deciding to sell his Ruthin Estate of Exmewe House to a fellow mercer, Edward Goodman. Exmewe House or Nant Clwyd-y-Dre may have been the birthplace of Gabriel Goodman, as the family had connections with both properties.

Details of the next 200 years are unclear. It became the &quot;King&#x27;s Arms&quot; in the occupation of John Price. It then became the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Arms&quot; (during the reign of Queen Anne, 1702–1714). The property was purchased for £300 on 5 November 1718 by Robert Myddleton of Chirk. The property served as a chemist&#x27;s through the 19th century until 1913. It was then sold as part of the Castle Estate sales in 1913/1919, for £1275 to Mr Lecomber, who in turn sold it to Barclays Bank, which modernised it to what can be seen today.

;The Post Office
Now trading as the Celtic Hair Studio at 2 Well Street. Originally a public house, it was reputedly built in 1401, making it the oldest pub in Ruthin. Lewis Jones, in his 1884 &quot;Handbook For Ruthin and the Vicinity&quot;, stated that the old property, formerly the &quot;Ruth Inn&quot;, had been adapted as a post office some 25 years before. It ceased trading in 1773. In 1850, the building was converted into a drapery, then becoming the town post office again until 1904.

The site of the present post office may have been a medieval Carmelite priory of White Friars, said to have been founded and built by Reginald de Grey and partly destroyed by the Reformation. De Grey also provided a large piece of land close to the castle known as Whitefriars. During the 1860s and 1870s the site housed the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Head&quot; public house and a horse-feed chandler; both buildings were destroyed by a 1904 fire; the new post office was built in 1906.

===Clwyd Street===
;Reebees
Located at 33, 35 and 37 Clwyd Street opposite the gaol and now a florist, it was originally the &quot;Red Lion&quot; public house. In 1824 the hangman, Sam Burrows, was staying at the &quot;Red Lion&quot; on the night before the execution of John Connor, a highway robber. He gave a detailed demonstration of how he actually hanged a man, unfortunately the stool was accidentally kicked away and Burrows almost hanged himself. The public house ceased trading in 1905.

;The &quot;Royal Oak&quot;
Now flats, the &quot;Royal Oak&quot; is one of the finest buildings in Ruthin, having three cruck frames, it is a Grade II* listed building.

====Porth y Dŵr====
At No. 65 Clwyd Street, this Grade II* listed building retains much of the medieval timber frame internally, the oak for which was felled in 1455 and 1456. Its original purpose is unknown, although it has a medieval arched doorway facing towards the 13th-century mill, and a 15th-century solar (private living quarters) with an open roof with cusped windbraces. It is said to have been converted for domestic use in 1586 and occupied by the Moyle family. A two-storey porch with glazed windows (previously described as a balcony) and internal timber panelling was added, possibly in 1655 when further alterations were made. The building was extensively altered in the 19th century, being converted partly into a shop. Porth y Dŵr originally formed a single building with No. 67 Clwyd Street (listed Grade II), and adjoined the medieval west gate to the town, which was demolished in 1786.

===Castle Street===
All buildings on Castle Street are listed by Cadw. These are the earliest settlements outside the walls of the castle. Some have burgage plots at the back, established by de Grey in 1283. The plots and linear arrangement have barely changed since their foundation.

While there were residential properties at the castle end of the street, commercial properties appeared at the end close to St Peters Square. The one exception was the pub &quot;Yr Iwerddon&quot; at No. 15. The house retains a name referring to its connection with Irish drovers attending markets and fairs.

Other establishments of interest include No. 1, now Boots, formerly the &quot;Raven Inn&quot;, which in 1560 may have been the birthplace of Bishop Richard Parry, pupil and master (1584) of Ruthin School. He was involved with Dean Gabriel Goodman and others in translating the Bible and prayer book into Welsh. The main contributor was Bishop William Morgan, but Parry&#x27;s revision in 1620 became the accepted authorised version. 
The Ruthin Royal Bowling Green used the Raven as their headquarters until the Cornwallis-Wests came to live in Ruthin Castle. The club met at the &quot;Raven&quot; for its annual and quarterly meetings. When competitions took place, the staff of the &quot;Raven&quot; would take &quot;cwrw da&quot; (good beer) to the players. With the arrival of the Wests, the bowling green laid out inside the curtilage of the castle forced the club to find an alternative green. The option accepted was the rear of No. 8 Castle Street &quot;Gorphwysfa&quot;, then called the Constitutional Club, later renamed the Conservative Club.

*No. 2. The Wine Vaults with a six-column Tuscan colonnade were &#x27;known as the &quot;Black Horse&quot; in the 1820s. This is verified by the Welsh Office survey.
*No. 7. Sir John Trevor House served as Totty&#x27;s the Lawyers in the 1700s, later as an antique shop and tea shop, and finally as a private residence offering bed and breakfast accommodation. Sir John Trevor was Speaker of the House of Commons from 1690 to 1695, when he was dismissed for embezzlement. He was the only Speaker forced to resign, until the forced departure of Michael Martin on 19 May 2009.
*&quot;Gorphwysfa&quot; was part of the Castle estate until sold off its owners in 1919. The Rifle Volunteer Corps founded in 1859 stored its armoury at the house until a drill hall was built in Borthyn in 1885. The property became the Conservative Club in November 1885.
*No. 9, known as &quot;Corwen&quot;, held the offices of Phillips the Attorney. It is now a private residence.
*No. 11, Ardwyn, is a private residence on three storeys, formerly the offices of the attorneys Smarts.
*No. 12, Plas-yn-Dre, cannot be dated accurately. It was rebuilt in 1823, as recorded by a stone above the front door. It housed the North and South Wales Bank. L. G. Thomas, prime mover in the founding the Presbyterian Church in Wynnstay Road in 1886, was bank manager and lived here.
*Nos 16 and 18 are wooden-framed buildings with a 19th-century frontage. They formed part of the Castle estate sales of 1913 and 1919. They probably represent the first use of stucco in Ruthin.

===Record Street===
The Old County Hall, now Ruthin Library, is a Grade II Listed Building in Record Street, originally named Stryd y Chwain (Welsh for Flea Street) due to its very low standard of living. The inferior housing was demolished to make way for the county court and much grander houses between 1785 and 1788. The present name reflects the storing of records from the assizes and shire hall. In 1860 it became the county court, with a portico added at that time. It served as an assize court and housed its records until the 1970s. The library opened in the early 1990s.

The police station is a Grade II listed building of 1890. Before it was built, the original one was housed in Ruthin Gaol. The new one gave convenient access to the courts. It contains four cells, which are no longer used, and a much reduced number of police officers.

===Well Street===
Castle Mews, a Grade II listed building is now a shopping precinct. It dates back to the 15th century, with examples of wattle and daub just inside the building on the right hand side. Remodeled in the early 19th century, it became the &quot;Cross Keys&quot; coaching inn serving the Ruthin to Chester route, with a change of horses in Mold. It later became a temperance commercial hotel and was home to one of the three Ruthin Friendly Societies: groups of male workers of similar background who contributed small amounts on a weekly basis for insurance against injury and old age. At a later date it was the offices of Ruthin Rural District Council.

Nos 10 and 12, a late 18th-century family town house, is Grade II listed. It retained its late Georgian character until converted into today&#x27;s boutique hotel and art gallery. The cellars are said to have been built of stone from Ruthin Castle. The building has had many uses: as a boarding house for Ruthin School until 1893, a doctors home, a family home, whose most famous resident was Cynthia Lennon, wife of John Lennon while their son Julian attended Ruthin School, a restaurant from the 1930s and a hotel. Today&#x27;s hotel architecture and art have won several awards.

The Wynnstay Hotel And Wayfarer Wool Shop, two separate buildings, were once connected by an archway, through which coaches and horses entered to the rear of the properties, where there were stables. The present Wayfarers shop is shown in the title deeds as an outbuilding consisting of &quot;an old saddle room, l with a room over and Gentleman&#x27;s Convenience&quot;.

The &quot;Wynnstay Hotel&quot;, now a private house, is first recorded in 1549 and known for many years as the &quot;Cross Foxes&quot;, which formed the heraldic arms of the Wynnstay family, which originated from Wrexham. Its members boasted they could travel from Chester to the Llŷn Peninsula without once leaving their own land. It was an important coaching inn for Ruthin to Denbigh travellers and served the Ruthin, Mold and Chester Royal Mail service. The pub in its heyday had a bowling green and tennis courts, and a central porch demolished in 1969.

Plas Coch (also known as the Conservative Club) is a Grade II listed building of medieval origin and a former 17th-century town house. It was rebuilt in 1613 using red sandstone from the castle and became home to the castle Constable. The building has two storeys with attics and four large windows on each floor. In 1963 it became a banqueting hall owned by Rees Jones, who used to trade at the village hall in Llanfair. It became the Conservative Club in 1977, and having been slightly altered, now offers all-round function facilities.

===Other areas===
The &quot;Spread Eagle&quot; recalls the coat-of-arms of the Goodwin family. Formerly an inn, records show it traded only from 1792 to 1915, after which it became a temperance hotel, then a retail shop.

===Rose Cottage===
Rose Cottage is a privately owned residence and a Grade II* listed building on the corner of Rhos Street and Haulfryn. It is listed as an &quot;exceptional survival of a medieval cruck-framed hall-house of relatively low status, retaining its plan-form, character and detail&quot;.

===Scott House===
Situated in the Corwen Road just past Ruthin Castle, Scott House was built 1933 to house the nursing staff of Duff House Sanatorium, which acquired Ruthin Castle and 475 acres (192 ha) of land for their private clinic in April 1923. The Grade II listed building set in landscaped grounds was later divided into flats.

===The Town Hall===
Ruthin Town Hall is located in Market Street. It was designed by J. W. Poundley and D. Walker in the High Victorian Gothic style and completed in 1865.

<doc id="335772" wikidata="Q4059117" url="?curid=335772" title="Japanese gunboat Akagi">
<text>was a steel-hulled, steam gunboat, serving in the early Imperial Japanese Navy. She was the fourth and final vessel to be completed in the four-vessel and was named after Mount Akagi in Gunma Prefecture.

==Background==
&quot;Akagi&quot; was the last in a series of 600-ton gunboats, which included the , , and , built from 1885–1886 under the supervisor of the French naval architect, Bellard. She was the only vessel in the class to be equipped with a steel-hull instead of an iron or composite hull.

==Construction==
&quot;Akagi&quot; was designed with a horizontal double expansion reciprocating steam engine with two cylindrical boilers driving two screws. She also had two masts for a schooner sail rig. Initially, she was armed with one Krupp L/22 breech-loading gun, one Krupp L/22 breech-loading gun and two quadruple 1-inch Nordenfelt guns, and was intended primarily for port defense. 
However, by early 1894, she had been rebuilt with a high short forecastle and four 120-millimeter guns arranged on her centerline, six 47-mm rapid-fire guns (two by the bridge, facing forward, and two mounted in small sponsons on either side of the hull). All guns were protected by gun shields. Well-armed for her size, she was soon rendered obsolete with the introduction of larger protected cruisers into the Imperial Japanese Navy inventory.

==Service record==
&quot; Akagi&quot; was laid down at the Onohama Shipyards on 20 July 1886 and launched on 7 August 1888. She was completed on 20 August 1890.

&quot;Akagi&quot; saw combat service in the First Sino-Japanese War, initially patrolling between Korea, Dairen and Weihaiwei. She was included in the Japanese squadron at the Battle of the Yalu River by Japanese Admiral Itō Sukeyuki, as he needed a ship with shallow draft to explore the shallows of Korea Bay. When the Japanese fleet closed with the Chinese Beiyang Fleet on 17 September 1894, &quot;Akagi&quot; was ordered protect the Japanese command ship, the converted passenger liner &quot;Saikyō Maru&quot; carrying Admiral Kabeyama Sukenori, towards the rear of the Japanese lines. However, &quot;Akagi&quot; came under attack by the much larger and faster Chinese cruiser at 13:20 hours. When &quot;Laiyuan&quot; closed to , &quot;Akagi&quot; opened fire, causing considerable damage and setting &quot;Laiyuan&quot; on fire. However, &quot;Laiyuan&quot;’s first salvo struck &quot;Akagi&quot; on the bridge, killing her captain, Sakamoto Hachirota. Command of the vessel was transferred to her navigator, Lieutenant Satō Tetsutarō, but &quot;Akagi&quot; continued to be pounded by the Chinese ship, with damage to her lower deck housing, and severing a steam line. Hot steam cut off access to her magazine, and shells had to be hand-fed through a broken vent to reach her guns. &quot;Akagi&quot; attempted to escape, but was raked from the stern by a full broadside by &quot;Laiyuan&quot;, whereas she could counter with only one of her 120-mm guns. When &quot;Laiyuan&quot; has closed to , she again scored a hit on &quot;Akagi&quot;’s bridge, incapacitating her provisional captain. Command was then transferred to a junior lieutenant, and &quot;Akagi&quot; continued to return fire with her stern guns. However, by 14:20, the fire on &quot;Laiyuan&quot; has spread to the extent that future offensive maneuvering was impossible, and she broke off pursuit. &quot;Akagi&quot; drifted out of control for the remainder of the battle, as her crew battled to fix damage. After the battle ended, she was able to return to the Japanese squadron under her own power. During this brief encounter, 11 men were killed and 17 wounded out of her crew of 111 men; however, she was credited with having taken a major enemy ship out of action.

On 21 March 1898, &quot;Akagi&quot; was re-designated as a second-class gunboat., and was used for coastal survey and patrol duties. During the Boxer Rebellion, &quot;Akagi&quot; was assigned to patrol off the Taku Forts.

During the Russo-Japanese War, &quot;Akagi&quot; assisted in the Siege of Port Arthur. On 2 May 1904, she assisted in the attempted blockade of the channel leading into the port. She was later sent to the western coast of Kwantung Peninsula to provide fire support during the Battle of Nanshan. While on patrol outside Port Arthur on 18 May 1904 she collided with the gunboat , which subsequently sank. &quot;Akagi&quot; later participated in the Invasion of Sakhalin.

&quot;Akagi&quot; was removed the navy list on 1 April 1911, and after being demilitarized, was sold as a transport in March 1912 to the Kawasaki Kisen Corporation as &quot;Akagi Maru&quot;. She was again sold in 1921 to the Amagasaki Steamship Lines, and sank in 1945 during a typhoon. She was raised, and placed into service again, only to be sunk by a naval mine in the Seto Inland Sea off of Okayama Prefecture in January 1946. Raised once more and repaired, she was placed back into service, until she was finally scrapped at Osaka in 1953.

<text>Christian Friedrich Schönbein HFRSE (18 October 1799 – 29 August 1868) was a German-Swiss chemist who is best known for inventing the fuel cell (1838) at the same time as William Robert Grove and his discoveries of guncotton and ozone. He also created the concept of geochemistry in 1838.

== Life ==
Schönbein (Schoenbein) related to Michael Schoenbein was born at Metzingen in the Duchy of Württemberg. Around the age of 13 he was apprenticed to a chemical and pharmaceutical firm at Böblingen. Through his own efforts, he acquired sufficient scientific skills and knowledge to ask for, and receive, an examination by the professor of chemistry at Tübingen. Schönbein passed the exam and, after a series of moves and university studies, eventually acquired a position at the University of Basel in 1828, becoming a full professor in 1835. He remained there until his death in 1868, and was buried in Basel.

== Fuel cell ==
In 1839, Schönbein published the principle of the fuel cell in the &quot;Philosophical Magazine&quot;.

== Ozone ==

While doing experiments on the electrolysis of water at the University of Basel, Schönbein first began to notice a distinctive odor in his laboratory. This smell gave Schönbein the clue to the presence of a new product from his experiments. Because of the pronounced smell, Schönbein coined the term &quot;ozone&quot; for the new gas, from the Greek word &quot;ozein&quot;, meaning &quot;to smell&quot;. Schönbein described his discoveries in publications in 1840. He later found that the smell of ozone was similar to that produced by the slow oxidation of white phosphorus.

The ozone smell Schönbein detected is the same as that occurring in the vicinity of lightning storms, an odor that indicates the presence of ozone in the atmosphere.

== Explosives ==

Although his wife had forbidden him to do so, Schönbein occasionally experimented at home in the kitchen. One day in 1845, when his wife was away, he spilled a mixture of nitric acid and sulfuric acid. After using his wife&#x27;s cotton apron to mop it up, he hung the apron over the stove to dry, only to find that the cloth spontaneously ignited and burned so quickly that it seemed to disappear. Schönbein, in fact, had converted the cellulose of the apron, with the nitro groups (added from the nitric acid) serving as an internal source of oxygen; when heated, the cellulose was completely and suddenly oxidized.

Schönbein recognized the possibilities of the new compound. Ordinary black gunpowder, which had reigned supreme in the battlefield for the past 500 years, exploded into thick smoke, blackening the gunners, fouling cannons and small arms, and obscuring the battlefield. Nitrocellulose was perceived as a possible &quot;smokeless powder&quot; and a propellant for artillery shells thus it received the name of guncotton.

Attempts to manufacture guncotton for military use failed at first because the factories were prone to explode and, above all else, the burning speed of straight guncotton was always too high. It was not until 1884 that Paul Vieille tamed guncotton into a successful progressive smokeless gunpowder called Poudre B. Later on, in 1891, James Dewar and Frederick Augustus Abel also managed to transform gelatinized guncotton into a safe mixture, called cordite because it could be extruded into long thin cords before being dried.

==Legacy==

In 1990 an asteroid was named after him.

<doc id="335774" wikidata="Q2480675" url="?curid=335774" title="Local Autonomy Act">
<text>The , passed by the House of Representatives and the House of Peers on March 28, 1947 and promulgated as Law No. 67 of 1947 on April 17, is an Act of devolution that established most of Japan&#x27;s contemporary local government structures and administrative divisions, including prefectures, municipalities and other entities. On July 16, 1999, the law was amended to eliminate administrative functions imposed upon local governments by the central governments and to establish Committee for Settling National-Local Disputes. The law and other relevant laws have been amended after the revision to promote decentralization.　

==Local public entities==
The classification of (LPEs) are:
*Ordinary LPEs
**Prefectures (to, dō, fu and ken)
**Municipalities
***Cities
***Towns
***Villages
*Special LPEs (incomplete)
**Special wards of Tokyo
**Unions of LPEs
***Partial operating unions
***Full operating unions
***Office operating unions
***Regional unions
**Property districts
**Regional development enterprises

Ordinary LPEs are the basic local governments. The distinction between ordinary and special LPEs is primarily relevant under the Constitution of Japan, which grants ordinary LPEs particular rights, including:

* Direct elections (Article 93.2)
* The right to legislate (Article 94)
* Citizen referendum prior to enactment of any statute which specifically affects the LPE (Article 95)

Special LPEs do not have these authorities except as otherwise provided by statute. While special wards are regarded as basic local governments within Tokyo, other special LPEs are consortia of LPEs for specific fields such as schools, waterworks and waste management.

LPEs are self-governing in many respects, but report indirectly to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications in Tokyo, which monitors relations between LPEs, as well as relations between LPEs and the government. The Ministry generally approves all inter-prefectural special LPEs, while inter-municipal special LPEs are approved by prefectural governors.

==Revision==
The Local Autonomy Act (paragraph 5 of Article 2) was revised in 1969 that required local governments to produce a forward-looking Basic Plan (kihon keikaku) for their long-term economic and social development, to cover a duration of around 25 years. It has to be approved by the elected local council as part of a comprehensive planning that tied to the local fiscal decision. Takegawa notes that in 1970, less than 10% of local governments had made comprehensive plans, by 1975 the number had gone up to 75%, and in 1980 it was almost 90%.

In January 2011, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications announced plans to revise the law to enable the national government to investigate the laws of the LPEs for extralegality and place lawsuits against them if they fail to correct their actions.

<text>Meagan Monique Good (born August 8, 1981) is an American actress and model. She first gained critical attention for her role in the film &quot;Eve&#x27;s Bayou&quot; (1997) prior to landing the role of Nina in the Nickelodeon sitcom &quot;Cousin Skeeter&quot; (1998–2001). Good received further prominence after starring in the films &quot;Deliver Us from Eva&quot; (2003), &quot;Roll Bounce&quot; (2005) and &quot;Stomp the Yard&quot; (2007).

In 2012, Good featured in an ensemble cast of the film &quot;Think Like a Man&quot;. The following year, she played Joanna Locasto, the lead character on the NBC drama series &quot;Deception&quot;, and starred in the comedy &quot;Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues&quot;. Good has also had supporting roles in the films &quot;One Missed Call&quot; (2008), &quot;Saw V&quot; (2008), &quot;The Unborn&quot; (2009), and as the superhero version of Darla Dudley in the DCEU films &quot;Shazam!&quot; (2019) and &quot;Shazam! Fury of the Gods&quot; (2023). She co-produced and starred in Tyler Perry&#x27;s &quot;Divorce in the Black&quot; (2024) for Amazon Prime Video.

== Early life and family ==
Good was born on August 8, 1981 in the Panorama City neighborhood of Los Angeles. Her mother, Tyra Wardlow-Doyle, worked as Good&#x27;s manager into her teens, and her father, Leondis &quot;Leon&quot; Good, is an LAPD police officer. Good was raised in Canyon Country (now known as Santa Clarita), California. She has three siblings, including older sister and fellow actress La&#x27;Myia Good. She began her acting career around the age of four.

According to Good, she grew up &quot;super nerdy, super skinny, buckteeth, big ole afro and yet I had a sense of confidence about myself, like, &#x27;they just don&#x27;t get it yet.&#x27;&quot; She has stated that she did not have any role models until early adulthood, when she began admiring actress Charlize Theron.

==Career==
===Childhood===
In the early stages of her career, Good worked as an extra on television shows such as &quot;Doogie Howser, M.D.&quot; and &quot;Amen&quot;. When she was 13, Good was cast in her first film, the 1995 comedy &quot;Friday&quot;. She first gained critical recognition for her performance as the troubled teen Cisely Batiste in Kasi Lemmons&#x27; 1997 film &quot;Eve&#x27;s Bayou&quot;; she received two award nominations, including her first NAACP Image Award nomination.

===Adulthood===
From 1998 to 2001, Good appeared as Nina on Nickelodeon&#x27;s TV show &quot;Cousin Skeeter&quot;. During this time, she landed small roles in the films &quot;3 Strikes&quot; and &quot;House Party 4: Down to the Last Minute&quot;. Good also appeared in many music videos, by artists such as 50 Cent, (21 Questions), Imajin, Isyss (of which Good&#x27;s sister La&#x27;Myia Good was a member), Lil&#x27; Johnny, Memphis Bleek, Tyrese, and Will Smith. After taking on small film and television roles for the next few years, Good began to transition into more mature roles in the early 2000s. Good believes she was able to move into adult roles due to playing characters several years younger than her.

In 2003, a major year for Good, she landed roles in the action-drama &quot;Biker Boyz&quot; and the romantic-comedy &quot;Deliver Us from Eva&quot;, which helped her transition from child to adult actress. She also appeared as the character Vanessa for one season of &quot;My Wife and Kids&quot;, before being replaced by another actor. In 2004, Good starred alongside Jordana Brewster, Sara Foster, and Jill Ritchie in the action film &quot;D.E.B.S.&quot;, and received a Best Actress nomination at the 2005 Black Movie Awards. She also had small roles in the teen dance film &quot;You Got Served&quot;, and Lance &quot;Un&quot; Rivera&#x27;s directorial debut, &quot;The Cookout&quot;.

In 2005, Good co-starred in the horror film &quot;Venom&quot;, as well as the well-received neo noir film &quot;Brick&quot;. She played opposite rapper/actor Bow Wow in Malcolm D. Lee&#x27;s &quot;Roll Bounce&quot;. In 2006, Good played the role of Coco, which she felt was her first true lead actress role, in the urban action-drama &quot;Waist Deep&quot;. Good also voiced a character for the video game &quot;&quot; that same year. The following year, Good landed a role in the dance movie &quot;Stomp the Yard&quot;, starring with Ne-Yo and childhood and personal 
friend Columbus Short. In 2008, Good appeared in the horror film &quot;One Missed Call&quot; as an ill-fated college student, Shelley Baum. She appeared as an angry trophy wife in the Mike Myers comedy &quot;The Love Guru&quot;, and in the latter half of the year, she was one of the victims/game players in &quot;Saw V&quot;. She starred in 2009&#x27;s &quot;The Unborn&quot; with Gary Oldman and Odette Yustman.
In 2010, Good started her own production company, Freedom Bridge Entertainment, with Marlon Olivera and fellow actors Tamara Bass and Ty Hodges. She was part of the ensemble cast in 2012&#x27;s &quot;Think Like a Man&quot;, a movie based on Steve Harvey&#x27;s 2009 book &quot;Act like a Lady, Think like a Man&quot;. In 2013, Good starred in &quot;Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues&quot;. Good returned to television from January to March 2013, starring in &quot;Deception&quot; after being contacted by her agents about the series while leaving a hair salon. According to the actress, she sat in her car &quot;and cried for 30-minutes like a nerd, by myself.&quot;

Good wore a royal blue dress designed by Michael Costello to the June 30, 2013 BET Awards ceremony. The dress featured a plunging neckline down to her midriff and a front slit that rose to mid-thigh, It was sometimes compared to the Green Versace dress worn by Jennifer Lopez to the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2000. &quot;Fashion &amp; Style&quot; editors selected Good as &quot;worst dressed&quot; at the ceremony.

The dress was controversial also because Good was presenting the BET Award for Best Gospel Artist. According to Christine Thomasos of &quot;The Christian Post&quot;, Good has a history of defending her stylistic choices of presenting herself as a &quot;sexy Christian&quot;. She had said earlier that year:

there is a classy way to do everything and there is nothing wrong with being sexy or having sex appeal and I think that I am definitely going to be someone who is boldly going to go out to the masses and be someone who say, &#x27;Look! Women its okay&#x27; ...

Good responded on Instagram, expressing sadness that judgment had been passed on her, her character and her then-husband DeVon Franklin over what she wore to the ceremony. She said she picked the dress because she liked it and tried to express her individuality in her dress. 

In 2014, Good reprised her role for &quot;Think Like a Man Too&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Think Like a Man&quot;. Good stated she &quot;had a really good time&quot; while filming the sequel in Las Vegas after initially being nervous &quot;because there&#x27;s so much energy that only Vegas can give.&quot; She later co-starred with Larenz Tate and Lance Gross in the 2017 Netflix film &quot;Deuces&quot;, and was star of 2019&#x27;s &quot;The Intruder&quot;. She also appeared in the movies &quot;Monster Hunter&quot; (2020) and &quot;Day Shift&quot; (2022). In 2024, Good had a lead role in Tyler Perry&#x27;s &quot;Divorce in the Black&quot;. She and actor Taye Diggs then starred in and executive produced &quot;Terry McMillan Presents: Forever&quot;, a Lifetime original movie.

== Personal life ==
Although she was not raised in the church, Good is a Protestant, considers herself a spiritual person and has said in numerous interviews that she declines roles that she feels might &quot;disappoint God.&quot; She explained in an interview that Jesus tops her list of heroes, and the last book she read was the Bible.

At age 22, Good chose to focus on her career rather than dating, as she explained in a 2004 interview. In 2011, Good began dating DeVon Franklin, an executive for Columbia Pictures and a Seventh-day Adventist preacher. They became engaged in early April 2012, and were married on June 16, 2012, at Triunfo Creek Winery in Malibu, California. The pair stated that they remained chaste in their relationship prior to their marriage. In December 2021, it was announced Good and Franklin were divorcing after nine years of marriage. Their divorce was finalized in June 2022.

In May 2023, Good began dating actor Jonathan Majors. In November 2024, the couple announced their engagement at Ebony magazine&#x27;s Power 100 event, where they first met in 2022.

<text>The Disney Afternoon (later known internally as the Disney-Kellogg Alliance when unbranded), sometimes abbreviated as TDA, was a created-for-syndication two-hour programming block of animated television series. It was produced by Walt Disney Television Animation and distributed through its syndication affiliate Buena Vista Television. Each show from the block has aired reruns on Disney Channel and Toon Disney. Disney Channel reaired four shows (&quot;Darkwing Duck&quot;, &quot;TaleSpin&quot;, &quot;DuckTales&quot;, and &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot;) on &quot;Block Party,&quot; a two-hour block that aired on weekdays in the late afternoon/early evening.&lt;ref name=&quot;October/November 1995&quot;&gt;&quot;Block Party: Four Disney Animated Series.&quot; &quot;The Disney Channel Magazine&quot;, Vol. 13, no. 5, October/November 1995: p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Disney Afternoon&#x27;s block had four half-hour segments, each of which contained an animated series. As each season ended, the lineup would shift - the remaining three would move up a time slot and a new show would be added to the end. The Disney Afternoon itself featured unique animated segments consisting of its opening and &quot;wrappers&quot; around the cartoon shows.

The Disney Afternoon originally ran from September 10, 1990, to August 29, 1997. For the 1997 and 1998 television seasons, it lost its name but was known internally as Disney-Kellogg Alliance, and shortened to 90 minutes. This version was followed by its gradual replacement by &quot;Disney&#x27;s One Too&quot; for UPN in 1999. Some of the shows also aired on Saturday mornings on ABC and CBS, concurrently with their original syndicated runs on The Disney Afternoon.

&quot;Goof Troop&quot; is the only show to reach the 2000s, with the 2000 direct-to-video finale &quot;An Extremely Goofy Movie&quot;. The 2010s and 2020s saw revivals of some shows such as &quot;DuckTales&quot; as a reboot on Disney Channel (and Disney XD), and &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot; with a live-action animation hybrid film on Disney+. In 2023, a reboot for &quot;TaleSpin&quot; and a live-action series for &quot;Gargoyles&quot; were reported to be in development for Disney+. 

== Background ==
The Disney Afternoon goes back to Michael Eisner becoming Disney&#x27;s CEO in 1984 and his push into steady animated television production, which would be based on new characters to bring in new young fans, with a newly launched TV animation department. He set up a Sunday meeting at his house consisting of creatives. They included Tad Stones from feature animation and Jymn Magon and Gary Kriesel from the music division. &quot;Mickey and the Space Pirates&quot; was pitched by Stones, but was turned down because Mickey Mouse is the company symbol. Stones also pitched a &quot;Rescuers&quot; TV series – the sequel was already under development at the time. Eisner suggested the Gummy bear as a series, given his kids liked the candy. Disney Television Animation&#x27;s first two shows, &quot;The Wuzzles&quot; and &quot;Adventures of the Gummi Bears&quot;, were sold to two networks, CBS and NBC, respectively, for their Saturday morning cartoon blocks.

== History ==
=== The Disney Afternoon ===
&quot;DuckTales&quot;, the series which would serve as the launching pad for what would become &quot;The Disney Afternoon&quot;, premiered in first-run syndication in the fall of 1987. Two years later in the fall of 1989, &quot;DuckTales&quot; was joined by &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot;, and both series were being offered in syndication as an hour-long program block. &quot;The Disney Afternoon&quot; kept these shows, added &quot;Gummi Bears&quot; and &quot;TaleSpin&quot;, and premiered on September 10, 1990, via Disney&#x27;s syndication arm Buena Vista Television.

&quot;DuckTales&quot; had been airing on many affiliates of the then-young Fox network and its group of owned-and-operated stations, including KTTV in Los Angeles; this may have been due to the fact that the Walt Disney Company&#x27;s chief operating officer at the time, Michael Eisner, and his then-Fox counterpart, Barry Diller, had worked together previously at ABC and at Paramount Pictures. However, as &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale&quot; was being launched, Disney was in the process of purchasing Los Angeles independent station KHJ-TV from RKO General. Through Buena Vista Television, Disney opted to reclaim the Los Angeles broadcast rights for &quot;DuckTales&quot; and moved it from KTTV to be paired with &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale&quot; on its newly purchased station, which was renamed KCAL-TV in December 1989. Furious at the breach of contract, Diller pulled &quot;DuckTales&quot; from all of Fox&#x27;s other owned-and-operated stations in the fall of 1989. Diller also encouraged the network&#x27;s affiliates to do the same, though most did not initially. This caused the retaliatory formation of Fox Kids. (Ironically, most of the assets of Fox Kids would be bought by Disney in 2001 via their acquisition of Fox Family Worldwide.)

As the years went on, new shows would be added at the end of the block, with the oldest shows being dropped from the lineup. The 1991–92 season, for instance, saw &quot;Gummi Bears&quot;&#x27; removal, and &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; being added to the end. After &quot;DuckTales&quot;, &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale&quot;, and &quot;TaleSpin&quot; were removed from &quot;The Disney Afternoon&quot;, they continued to rerun in syndication separately from the block until 1995.

By the fifth season in 1994, the block had removed its original four shows and undergone a makeover, with the primary branding being the block&#x27;s initials, &quot;TDA&quot;. At this point, the original idea of shows being added and removed yearly was dropped, as both new and old shows were now stripped all week, or only aired on certain days. The lineup at this point included &quot;Aladdin&quot;, &quot;Goof Troop&quot; and &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; stripped, while one daily slot was split between &quot;The Shnookums and Meat Funny Cartoon Show&quot; and &quot;Gargoyles&quot;, book-ending three days a week of &quot;Bonkers&quot;.

The Disney Channel developed a similar programming block called &quot;Block Party&quot;, which premiered on October 2, 1995 (airing concurrently with TDA&#x27;s sixth season) and was similarly scheduled and stripped with the early Disney Afternoon series of &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot;, &quot;TaleSpin&quot;, &quot;DuckTales&quot;, and &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot;.

=== Disney-Kellogg&#x27;s Alliance ===
By August 1996, owing to decreasing business in the syndicated children&#x27;s television market due to new competitors such as the cable networks Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon, and the new networks The WB and UPN with having children&#x27;s blocks of their own, Buena Vista agreed with the Leo Burnett agency to market and distribute a revamped version of the block for the 1997–98 and 1998–99 television seasons. Buena Vista established a partnership with Leo Burnett and Kellogg&#x27;s—who had been a major sponsor of The Disney Afternoon—to purchase an amount of dedicated advertising inventory. The new block did not carry any blanket branding, but was referred to internally as the &quot;Disney-Kellogg Alliance.&quot;

With the September 1, 1997, season started, the block dropped &quot;The Disney Afternoon&quot; name, a half-hour from the stripped block and the &quot;Gargoyles&quot; series. Moving to the Disney Channel were &quot;Disney&#x27;s Aladdin&quot; and The Lion King&#x27;s &quot;Timon &amp; Pumbaa&quot;. &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot;, which was shared with ABC&#x27;s &quot;Disney&#x27;s One Saturday Morning&quot; (which broadcast their own set of episodes), premiered on the block. &quot;Mighty Ducks&quot; and &quot;Quack Pack&quot; reruns shared the second slot in a Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesdays through Fridays, split respectively. &quot;DuckTales&quot; repeats filled the third half-hour slot, with flexibility for the local station to air it at other times.

In 1998, Disney reached a deal to program a new children&#x27;s block for UPN, &quot;Disney&#x27;s One Too&quot;, as a replacement for that network&#x27;s internal UPN Kids block. The syndicated block ran until the debut of &quot;One Too&quot; on September 6, 1999.

== International broadcasts ==
In Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, the city&#x27;s then-independent TV station ITV (now Global Edmonton) produced its own version of &quot;The Disney Afternoon&quot; over roughly the same period as the American block, but only once per week in a two-hour block on Saturday afternoons, though using the same cartoon lineup as the American weekday block. Apart from the animated introduction, the block did not use any Disney-produced wrapper segments, but instead used locally produced live-action segments between programs with host Mike Sobel.

In Denmark, DR1 started its version of the block (&quot;Disney Sjov&quot;) on October 25, 1991. It aired every Friday night and would consist of two half-hour shows along with two classic cartoons, all within one commercial-free hour. The block ended on December 30, 2022, in favor of locally produced Nordic children&#x27;s programming.

== Shows ==
Over the years, the block featured the following shows:
== Adaptations ==
=== Comic books ===
The block was adapted into comic books, films and launched the &quot;Disney Adventures&quot; magazine.

=== Disney parks ===
Characters from the shows first appeared in Disney parks with the debut of Mickey&#x27;s Birthdayland in the Magic Kingdom, Walt Disney World. In 1990, the characters got a daily show, &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Magical TV World&quot;, which lasted until 1996.

The popularity of The Disney Afternoon led to a temporary attraction at Disneyland in Fantasyland called &quot;Disney Afternoon Avenue.&quot; Disney Afternoon Avenue was a feature of Disneyland from March 15 to November 10, 1991. Two attractions were also made over to match series from the block.

=== Video games ===
Many of &quot;The Disney Afternoon&quot; shows were adapted into video games.

<text>Samuel Siegfried Bing (26 February 1838 – 6 September 1905), who usually gave his name as S. Bing (not to be confused with his brother, Samuel Otto Bing, 1850–1905), was a German-French art dealer who lived in Paris as an adult, and who helped introduce Japanese art and artworks to the West and was a factor in the development of the Art Nouveau style during the late nineteenth century.

==Early life==
Bing was born in Hamburg, a member of a large family with diverse commercial interests. He relocated to France in 1854, to help manage the ceramics manufacturing business of Bing family in-laws, and resided in France for the remainder of his life. He became a naturalized French citizen in 1876. Bing married a second cousin, Johanna Baer, in July 1868. Their son Marcel Bing eventually became a business associate of his father&#x27;s, as well as a jewelry designer of Art Nouveau style.

==Career==
In 1873, on the death of his elder brother Michael, Siegfried Bing became the head of Bing family enterprises in France. Bing developed a flourishing import-export business from the 1870s onward, working through several commercial entities with various partners and family members; he concentrated on the importation and sale of Japanese and other Asian &quot;objets d&#x27;art,&quot; though his business also exported French goods to Japan, working through a Yokohama office managed by his younger brother August. In December 1895 he opened his famous gallery, the Maison de l&#x27;Art Nouveau, which showed works of artists of what would become known as the Art Nouveau style. Henry van de Velde designed the interior of the gallery, while Louis Comfort Tiffany supplied stained glass. Bing&#x27;s gallery featured entire rooms designed in the Art Nouveau style by his in-house designers.

During the gallery&#x27;s most successful period, 1896–1902, Bing sold a great variety of artistic work, included fabrics designed by William Morris, glassware by Louis Comfort Tiffany, jewelry, paintings, ceramics, stained glass, and furniture of Art Nouveau style. Bing dealt with customers ranging from private collectors to major museums, and helped to promote a global art market. His pavilion at the 1900 Paris World&#x27;s Fair was especially notable. By this time Bing was the primary European dealer for the Rookwood Pottery Co. of Cincinnati and the Grueby Faience Company of Boston, as well as the wares of Tiffany.

Bing had also a significant role in promoting artists who were associated in the new style movement named Les Nabis, including Pierre Bonnard, Édouard Vuillard, Maurice Denis, Paul Sérusier, Paul Ranson and Félix Vallotton. 

==Influence==
Bing advanced the careers of a wide range of artists, including Louis Bonnier, Frank Brangwyn, and Édouard Vuillard, the designers Eugène Gaillard, Edward Colonna, William Benson, and Georges de Feure, and the sculptor Constantin Meunier. Bing closed his gallery during 1904, a year before his death, when the fashion for Art Nouveau was already beginning to wane.

Bing&#x27;s activities were important, perhaps crucial, to the Japanese influence on Art Nouveau. He published a monthly journal, &quot;Le Japon Artistique&quot;, which began in 1888 and was collected in three volumes in 1891. The journal influenced people like Gustav Klimt.

<doc id="335796" wikidata="Q2963375" url="?curid=335796" title="Peach Bowl">
<text>The Peach Bowl is an annual college football bowl game played annually in Atlanta, Georgia, since December 30, 1968.

The first three Peach Bowls were played at Grant Field on the Georgia Tech campus in Atlanta. Between 1971 and 1992, Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium hosted the game. From 1993 to 2016, the game was played at the Georgia Dome. The bowl then moved to Mercedes-Benz Stadium starting in 2017. Since 1997, it has been sponsored by Chick-fil-A and is officially known as the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl. From 2006 to 2013, it was named the Chick-fil-A Bowl.

From its beginning, the Peach Bowl often featured teams from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) and the Southeastern Conference (SEC). Between 1993 and 2013, the ACC and SEC established official tie-ins with the bowl game.

In 2014, the Peach Bowl, along with the &quot;New Year&#x27;s Six&quot; bowls, became a part of the College Football Playoff. As part of the four team playoff from 2014 to 2023, the Peach Bowl served as a semifinal game in 2016, 2019, and 2022.

With the expansion of the College Football Playoff to twelve teams in the 2024–25 season, the Peach Bowl will serve as either a quarterfinal or semifinal each year. It served as a quarterfinal in 2025 and will serve as a semifinal in 2026. When serving as a semifinal, the game will be played one week after New Year&#x27;s Day.

The winner of the bowl game is awarded the &quot;George P. Crumbley Trophy&quot;, named after the game&#x27;s founder George Crumbley.

==History==
Seven of the first ten meetings (all but the 1968, 1971, and 1974 games) pitted an Atlantic Coast Conference team against an at-large opponent. The bowl had no automatic berths prior to 1993, but usually featured an ACC team or a team from the Southeastern Conference. From 1993 until 2013, the game matched an SEC team against one from the ACC. From 1993 to 2005, this matchup was the third selection from the ACC against the fourth from the SEC. In 2005, the bowl hosted its first-ever matchup of top 10 ranked teams.

The Peach Bowl was the first charity bowl, and is credited to being created by Lions Club member George Pierre Crumbley Jr., known as the &quot;Father of the Peach Bowl&quot;, who shepherded it through NCAA certification. The game was originally created as a fund-raiser by the Lions Clubs of Georgia in 1968, but after years of lackluster attendance and revenue, the game was taken over by the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce in 1986.

Chick-fil-A, a fast food restaurant chain based in nearby College Park, has sponsored the game since 1997. From 2006 until 2013, Chick-fil-A&#x27;s contract gave it full naming rights and the game was referred to as the Chick-fil-A Bowl as a result. The traditional &quot;Peach Bowl&quot; name was reinstated following the announcement that the bowl would be one of the six College Football Playoff bowls.

The funds from the deal were used to increase payouts for the participating teams. In response, from 2006 to 2014 the ACC gave the committee the first pick of its teams after the BCS—usually the loser of the ACC Championship Game or one of the division runners-up. Also from 2006, the bowl got the fifth overall selection from the SEC (including the BCS). However, the BCS took two SEC schools in every season for the last nine years of its run, leaving the Chick-Fil-A with the sixth pick from the conference—usually one of the division runners-up. It ascended to major-bowl status when it was added to the &quot;New Year&#x27;s Six&quot; bowls starting with the 2014 season, assuring that it would feature major conference champions and/or prestigious runners-up.

As of 2013, the bowl was sold out for 17 straight years, the second-longest streak behind only the Rose Bowl Game. In 2007, the Chick-fil-A Bowl became the best-attended non-BCS bowl for the previous decade.

The 2007 game was played on December 31, 2007, featuring the second Peach Bowl matchup between #15 Clemson and #21 Auburn. It was the first time the Peach Bowl had ended regulation play with a tie, and with the rules in play since the early 1990s, required an overtime, which Auburn won, 23–20. With a 5.09 share (4.92 million households), the 2007 game was the highest-rated ESPN-broadcast bowl game of the 2007–2008 season as well as the highest rated in the game&#x27;s history. The rating was also higher than two New Year&#x27;s Day bowls, the Cotton and the Gator. In October 2009, the bowl extended the Atlantic Coast Conference contract through 2013. According to &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, although the bowl generated $12.3 million in profit in 2007, only $5.9 million of that was paid out to the participating schools. On December 31, 2012, the bowl set new records for viewership. The New Year&#x27;s Eve telecast – a 25-24 Clemson victory over LSU – averaged 8.557 million viewers (a 5.6 household coverage rating), making it ESPN&#x27;s most-viewed non-BCS bowl ever.

The 2017 season matchup, played January 1, 2018, featured an undefeated UCF playing an Auburn team that had in the regular season defeated both national championship contenders Georgia and Alabama (the eventual 2018 College Football Playoff Champion). A 34–27 UCF victory resulted in UCF being the only undefeated FBS team for the 2017 season. As such, UCF was selected as the 2017 national champions by one NCAA recognized selector and thus claims a share of the 2017 national championship.

The Peach Bowl has donated more than $32 million to charity since 2016.

<doc id="335804" wikidata="Q69829" url="?curid=335804" title="French Fourth Republic">
<text>The French Fourth Republic () was the republican government of France from 27 October 1946 to 4 October 1958, governed by the fourth republican constitution of 13 October 1946. Essentially a reestablishment and continuation of the French Third Republic which governed from 1870 during the Franco-Prussian War to 1940 during World War II, it suffered many of the same problems which led to its end. The French Fourth Republic was a parliamentary republic.

Despite political dysfunction, the Fourth Republic saw an era of great economic growth in France and the rebuilding of the nation&#x27;s social institutions and industry after World War II, with assistance from the United States through the Marshall Plan. It also saw the beginning of the rapprochement with France&#x27;s longtime enemy Germany, which led to Franco-German co-operation and eventually to the European Union.

The new constitution made some attempts to strengthen the executive branch of government to prevent the unstable situation before the war, but instability remained and the French Fourth Republic saw frequent changes of government – there were 21 administrations in its 12-year history. Moreover, the government proved unable to make effective decisions regarding decolonization of the numerous remaining French colonies. After a series of crises culminating in the Algerian crisis of 1958, the French Fourth Republic collapsed. Wartime leader Charles de Gaulle returned from retirement to preside over a transitional administration empowered to design a new French constitution. The Fourth Republic was dissolved on 5 October 1958 following a public referendum which established the current French Fifth Republic with a strengthened presidency.

== Founding of the Fourth Republic ==
After the liberation of France in 1944, the Vichy government was dissolved and the Provisional Government of the French Republic (, GPRF), also known as the French Committee of National Liberation, was instituted after a unanimous request of the Provisional Consultative Assembly to be properly represented. With most of the political class discredited and containing many members who had more or less collaborated with Nazi Germany, Gaullism and communism became the most popular political forces in France.

Charles de Gaulle led the GPRF from 1944 to 1946. Meanwhile, negotiations took place over the proposed new constitution, which was to be put to a referendum. DeGaulle advocated a presidential system of government, and criticized the reinstatement of what he pejoratively called &quot;the parties system&quot;. He resigned in January 1946 and was replaced by Felix Gouin of the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (, SFIO). Ultimately only the French Communist Party (, PCF) and the socialist SFIO supported the draft constitution, which envisaged a form of government based on unicameralism; but this was rejected in the referendum of 5 May 1946.

For the 1946 elections, the Rally of Left Republicans (, RGR), which encompassed the Radical-Socialist Party, the Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance and other conservative parties, unsuccessfully attempted to oppose the Christian democrat and socialist MRP–SFIO–PCF alliance. The new constituent assembly included 166 MRP deputies, 153 PCF deputies and 128 SFIO deputies, giving the tripartite alliance an absolute majority. Georges Bidault of the MRP replaced Felix Gouin as the head of government.

A new draft of the Constitution was written, which this time proposed the establishment of a bicameral form of government. Leon Blum of the SFIO headed the GPRF from 1946 to 1947. After a new legislative election in June 1946, the Christian democrat Georges Bidault assumed leadership of the Cabinet. Despite DeGaulle&#x27;s so-called discourse of Bayeux of 16 June 1946 in which he denounced the new institutions, the new draft was approved by 53% of voters voting in favor (with an abstention rate of 31%) in the referendum held on 13 October 1946 and the Constitution of 27 October 1946 came into force two weeks later as the Fourth Republic, in an arrangement in which executive power essentially resided in the hands of the President of the Council (the prime minister). The President of the Republic was given a largely symbolic role, although he remained chief of the French Army and as a last resort could be called upon to resolve conflicts.

After the expulsion of the Communists from the governing coalition, France joined the Cold War against Stalin, as expressed by becoming a founding member of NATO in April 1949. France now took a leadership position in unifying western Europe, working closely with Konrad Adenauer of West Germany. Robert Schuman, who was twice Prime Minister and at other times Minister of Finance and Foreign Minister, was instrumental in building post-war European and trans-Atlantic institutions. A devout Catholic and anti-Communist, he led France to be a member of the European Communities, the Council of Europe and NATO.

== Trente Glorieuses ==

&quot;Les Trente Glorieuses&quot; (&#x27;The Glorious Thirty&#x27;) was the high prosperity in the 30 years from 1945 to 1975. In 1944, DeGaulle introduced a dirigiste economic policy, which included substantial state control over a capitalist economy, which was followed by 30 years of unprecedented growth.

The wartime damage was extensive, and large reparations from defeated Germany did not happen. The United States helped revive the French economy with the Marshall Plan (1948–1951), giving France $2.3 billion with no repayment. France was the second largest recipient after Britain. The total of all American grants and credits to France from 1946 to 1953 amounted to $4.9 billion. It provided urgently needed funding for modernizing transport systems, electricity generation, and basic industries including cement, coal, and steel. The plan required a modernization of French industrial and managerial systems, free trade, and friendly economic relations with West Germany.

The French economy grew rapidly like economies of other developed countries within the framework of the Marshall Plan such as West Germany, Italy, and Japan. These decades of economic prosperity combined high productivity with high average wages and high consumption, and were also characterised by a highly developed system of social benefits. According to various studies, the real purchasing power of the average French worker&#x27;s salary went up by 170% between 1950 and 1975, while overall private consumption increased by 174% in the period 1950-1974. The French standard of living, which had been damaged by both World Wars, became one of the world&#x27;s highest. The population also became far more urbanized; many rural départements experienced a population decline while the larger metropolitan areas grew considerably, especially that of Paris. Ownership of various household goods and amenities increased considerably, while the wages of the French working class rose significantly as the economy became more prosperous. As noted by the historians Jean Blondel and Donald Geoffrey Charlton in 1974,

The worldwide 1973 oil crisis slowed down its explosive growth. Thus, the mid-1970s marked the end of the period. Thomas Piketty describes the Trente Glorieuses as an exceptional &quot;catch up&quot; period following the world wars. He cites statistics showing that normal growth in wealthy countries is about 1.5–2%, whereas in Europe growth dropped to 0.5% between 1913 and 1950, and then &quot;caught up&quot; with a growth rate of 4% between 1950 and 1970, until settling back to 1.5–2% from 1970 onward.

== Indochina and Tunisia ==

Public opinion polls showed that in February 1954, only 7% of the French people wanted to continue the fight in Indochina against the Communists, led by Ho Chi Minh and his Viet Minh movement.

Pierre Mendès France was a Radical Party leader who was Prime Minister for eight months in 1954–55, working with the support of the Socialist and Communist parties. His top priority was ending the war in Indochina, which had already cost 92,000 dead, 114,000 wounded and 28,000 captured in the wake of the humiliating defeat at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in early May 1954.

At the Geneva Conference (1954), he made a deal that gave the Viet Minh control of Vietnam north of the 17th parallel, and allowed him to pull out all French forces. That left South Vietnam standing alone. However, the United States moved in and provided large-scale financial, military and economic support for South Vietnam.

Mendès France next came to an agreement with Habib Bourguiba, the nationalist leader in Tunisia, for the independence of that colony by 1956, and began discussions with the nationalist leaders in Morocco for a French withdrawal.

== Failure of the new parliamentary system ==
The intention of the new Constitution&#x27;s authors was to rationalize the parliamentary system. Ministers were accountable to the legislative body, the French National Assembly, but some measures were introduced in order to protect the Cabinet and to reinforce the authority of the Prime Minister of France, who led the Cabinet. The goal of the new constitution was to reconcile parliamentary democracy with ministerial stability.

For instance, under the new Constitution, the President of the Council was the leader of the executive branch (Prime Minister of France). The President of the French Republic, elected by the Parliament (the National Assembly and the Council of the Republic), played a symbolic role. His main power was to propose a Prime Minister, who was subject to election by the National Assembly before forming a Cabinet. Only the Prime Minister could invoke a parliamentary vote on legitimacy of the Cabinet. The Prime Minister was also the only member of the executive able to demand a vote of confidence from the National Assembly (in the Third Republic any minister could call for a vote of confidence). The Cabinet could be dismissed if an absolute majority of the National Assembly&#x27;s members voted against the Cabinet. Finally, the National Assembly could be dissolved after two ministerial crises in the legislature.

However, these constitutional measures did not work. In January 1947, after his election by the National Assembly and the nomination of his ministers, Prime Minister Paul Ramadier called for a vote of confidence in order to verify that the Assembly approved the composition of his Cabinet. This initiated a custom of double election, a vote for the Prime Minister followed by a vote of confidence in the chosen Cabinet, that weakened the Prime Minister&#x27;s authority over the Cabinet. Cabinets were dismissed with only a plurality (not the absolute majority) of the National Assembly voting against the Cabinet. Consequently, these ministerial crises did not result in the dissolution of Parliament. Thus, as in the Third Republic, this regime was characterized by ministerial instability.

The Fourth Republic was also a victim of the political context. The split of the three-party alliance in spring 1947, the departure of Communist ministers, Gaullist opposition, and the new proportional representation did not create conditions for ministerial stability. Governmental coalitions were composed of an undisciplined patchwork of center-left and center-right parties. Finally, the Fourth Republic was confronted with the collapse of the French colonial empire.

== European countries ==
The creation of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was first proposed by French foreign minister Robert Schuman and French economist Jean Monnet on 9 May 1950 as a way to prevent further war between France and Germany. Though the United Kingdom was invited, its Labour government, then preparing for a re-election fight, did not join the initiative. It was formally established in 1951 by the Treaty of Paris, signed by France, Italy, West Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Between these countries the ECSC would create a common market for coal and steel. The ECSC was governed by a &#x27;High Authority&#x27;, checked by bodies representing governments; representatives of the peoples of the member States (selected from each state&#x27;s Members of Parliament); and an independent judiciary.

The Treaty of Paris (1951), which created the ECSC, was superseded on 25 March 1957 by the Treaty of Rome, which established the European Economic Community (the forerunner to the European Union, created in 1993 through the Maastricht Treaty).

== Algeria and collapse ==
The trigger for the collapse of the Fourth Republic was the Algiers crisis of 1958. France was still a colonial power, although conflict and revolt had begun the process of decolonization. French West Africa, French Indochina, and French Algeria still sent representatives to the French parliament under systems of limited suffrage in the French Union. Algeria in particular, despite being the colony with the largest French-identifying population, saw rising pressure for separation from the . The situation was complicated by those in Algeria, such as the Pieds-Noirs, who wanted to stay part of France, so the Algerian War became not just a separatist movement but had elements of a civil war.

Further complications came when a section of the French Army rebelled and openly backed the &quot;&quot; movement to defeat separation. Revolts and riots broke out in 1958 against the French government in Algiers, but there were no adequate and competent political initiatives by the French government in support of military efforts to end the rebellion owing to party politics. The feeling was widespread that another debacle like that of Indochina in 1954 was in the offing and that the government would order another precipitous pullout and sacrifice French honour to political expediency. This prompted General Jacques Massu to create a French settlers&#x27; committee to demand the formation of a new national government under General DeGaulle, who was a national hero and had advocated a strong military policy, nationalism and the retention of French control over Algeria. General Massu, who had gained prominence and authority when he ruthlessly suppressed Algerian militants, famously declared that unless General DeGaulle was returned to power, the French Army would openly revolt; General Massu and other senior generals covertly planned the takeover of Paris with 1,500 paratroopers preparing to take over airports with the support of French Air Force units. Armoured units from Rambouillet prepared to roll into Paris.

On 24 May, French paratroopers from the Algerian corps landed on Corsica, taking the French island in a bloodless action called . Operation Resurrection would be implemented if DeGaulle was not approved as leader by the French Parliament, if DeGaulle asked for military assistance to take power, or to thwart any organized attempt by the French Communist Party to seize power or stall DeGaulle&#x27;s return.

DeGaulle, who had announced his retirement from politics a decade before, placed himself in the midst of the crisis, calling on the nation to suspend the government and create a new constitutional system. On 29 May 1958, French politicians agreed upon calling on DeGaulle to take over the government as prime minister. The French Army&#x27;s willingness to support an overthrow of the constitutional government was a significant development in French politics. With Army support, DeGaulle&#x27;s government terminated the Fourth Republic (the last parliament of the Fourth Republic voted for its dissolution) and drew up a new constitution proclaiming the French Fifth Republic in 1958.

<text>The Rate Bowl is an annual college football bowl game that has been played in the state of Arizona since 1989, under several different names.

Played as the Copper Bowl from inception through 1996, it was known as the Insight.com Bowl from 1997 through 2001, then the Insight Bowl from 2002 through 2011, the Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl for 2012 and 2013, and the Cactus Bowl for the 2014 through 2017 seasons. In 2018 and 2019, the game was known as the Cheez-It Bowl. In 2020, Guaranteed Rate signed on as the title sponsor of the game, renaming it as the Guaranteed Rate Bowl. In October 2024, the game became the Rate Bowl as part of a company rebrand.

When the bowl was founded, it was played at Arizona Stadium in Tucson, on the campus of the University of Arizona. In 2000, the organizers moved the game from Tucson to Phoenix. There, it was played at what became known as Chase Field, the home of the Arizona Diamondbacks of Major League Baseball. For the 2006 season, the bowl moved a second time. After the annual Fiesta Bowl left Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe to play in University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, the bowl (then still known as the Insight Bowl) was relocated there as a permanent replacement. The bowl returned to its previous home at Chase Field in Phoenix for the January 2016 event, due to renovation work at Sun Devil Stadium that was expected to last at least three off-seasons. The bowl has remained at Chase Field, making it one of three bowl games staged in baseball stadiums, the other two being the Pinstripe Bowl at Yankee Stadium and the Fenway Bowl at Fenway Park.

==History==
&quot;Cactus Bowl&quot; had been the originally planned name for what became the Copper Bowl in 1989. The game was played under the Copper Bowl name through 1996, after which title sponsorship rights were assumed by Insight Enterprises, which self-titled the game from 1997 through 2011. In 2012, restaurant chain Buffalo Wild Wings became the sponsor and self-titled the game for two years. Buffalo Wild Wings declined to renew sponsorship following the 2013 game, at which time organizers opted to rename the game &quot;Cactus Bowl&quot; rather than reverting to the Copper Bowl name. There had been a Texas-based Cactus Bowl played in Division II, but that game was discontinued after 2011. For 2014, TicketCity sponsored the new Cactus Bowl, and Motel 6 became the sponsor in 2015. In 2018, Kellogg&#x27;s became the sponsor and rebranded the bowl, naming it after its cheese cracker brand, Cheez-It. In May 2020, the Cactus Bowl name returned, as Cheez-It sponsorship moved to what had been known as the Camping World Bowl played in Orlando, Florida.

For the first ten years, the game was played at Arizona Stadium, on the campus of the University of Arizona in Tucson. In 2000, the bowl&#x27;s organizers moved the game to Bank One Ballpark, a baseball-specific stadium, in downtown Phoenix. In 2006, the game moved to Sun Devil Stadium at Arizona State University in Tempe to replace the Fiesta Bowl, which had moved to University of Phoenix Stadium in the Phoenix suburb of Glendale. The 2006 game set a record (since tied in the 2016 Alamo Bowl) for the biggest comeback in NCAA Division I FBS bowl history, as Texas Tech came back from a 38–7 third-quarter deficit to defeat Minnesota in overtime, 44–41.

For the first three playings of the Copper Bowl, TBS carried the game. Beginning in 1992 and continuing until the 2005 playing, the game aired on ESPN. After a four-year hiatus, during which NFL Network carried the game, ESPN regained the rights beginning in 2010.

The 2020 edition of the bowl was cancelled on December 20, 2020, due to an insufficient number of teams available to fill all 2020–21 bowl games, after a season impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Conference tie-ins===
Before 2006, the game mainly featured teams from the Pac-10, Western Athletic Conference, Big 12, and old Big East conferences. From 2006 to 2013, it began featuring an annual matchup between teams from the Big Ten and the Big 12. Starting with the 2015 game, it featured a matchup between Pac-12 and Big 12 teams. Teams from the Atlantic Coast Conference and Mountain West Conference have also competed, along with teams from the now defunct Southwest Conference and Big Eight, and one independent school (Notre Dame in 2004). In July 2019, the bowl announced tie-ins with the Big Ten and Big 12 conferences, starting with the 2020–21 season and continuing through the 2025–26 season.

<text>The ReliaQuest Bowl is an annual college football bowl game played in Tampa, Florida. The event was known as the Hall of Fame Bowl from 1986 to 1995 and the Outback Bowl from 1996 to 2022. It was held at Tampa Stadium from 1986 until 1999, when it moved to then-new Raymond James Stadium. The bowl has been played on New Year&#x27;s Day for most of its history, often the first game to kick off on a day that is traditionally filled with post-season college football.

==History==
===Previous Tampa bowl game===
The Cigar Bowl was played at old Phillips Field near downtown Tampa from 1947 to 1954. Because the Cigar Bowl featured teams from smaller colleges, however, the 1986 Hall of Fame Bowl was the first major college bowl game to be played in the area.

===Hall of Fame Bowl===

The Hall of Fame Classic was a mid-level bowl game played at Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama from 1977 to 1985. In the spring of 1986, the National Football Foundation and College Football Hall of Fame decided to discontinue their association with the bowl and realign with a new game to be played in Tampa Stadium which would inherit the Hall of Fame Bowl name. Tampa&#x27;s Hall of Fame Bowl did not initially have any conference tie-ins, so organizers often sought to arrange a match-up between a team from a southern school (usually the Southeastern Conference or Atlantic Coast Conference) and one from another region of the country to maximize both game attendance and potential visitors to the area.

===Outback Bowl===

Tampa-based restaurant chain Outback Steakhouse became the game&#x27;s title sponsor in April 1995, allowing the bowl to increase its payout to participants and sign agreements with the SEC and the Big Ten conferences, creating an annual cross-regional match-up that has continued ever since. In 1999, the bowl moved from Tampa Stadium to newly constructed Raymond James Stadium next door. 

===ReliaQuest Bowl===
Though it had signed a six-year extension in 2019, the parent company of Outback Steakhouse decided to discontinue its association with the game in March 2022 in a cost-cutting measure, ending the longest continuous title sponsorship in college bowl history and resulting in a temporary renaming of the game to Tampa Bay Bowl. In June 2022, Tampa-based cybersecurity company ReliaQuest was announced as the new title sponsor. The ReliaQuest Bowl following the 2024 season was scheduled for December 31, 2024, making it the first edition of the bowl since its inaugural edition (played as the Hall of Fame Bowl) to be scheduled in December, and the first edition scheduled for New Year&#x27;s Eve, a change spurred by the expanded College Football Playoff.

==The game==

The bowl is played on New Year&#x27;s Day unless January 1 falls on a Sunday, in which case it is moved to the following Monday. It is usually the first game to start on a day which is traditionally full of college bowl games, and has kicked off as early as 11 a.m. ET. ESPN has had television rights to the game since 1993. Under an extension of those rights signed in 2010, ESPN broadcasts the game on either ABC, ESPN, or ESPN2, in conjunction with the Citrus Bowl and the New Year&#x27;s Six bowl games. Before 1993, the Hall of Fame Bowl aired on NBC.

Upon signing agreements with the SEC and Big Ten in 1995, the bowl had the third pick of teams from each conference after the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) teams were placed. Since 2014, both the SEC and Big Ten have worked with a group of several bowl games, including this one, to place their bowl-eligible teams after the College Football Playoff (CFP) and associated bowls have made their selections.

As of 2023, the bowl&#x27;s payout was $6.4 million for each participating team.

<doc id="335814" wikidata="Q746277" url="?curid=335814" title="Joey Tribbiani">
<text>Joseph Francis Tribbiani Jr. (born 1968) is a fictional character, serving as one of the primary characters of the NBC sitcom &quot;Friends&quot; and the protagonist of its spin-off &quot;Joey&quot;. He is portrayed by Matt LeBlanc in both series.

Joey is an Italian-American struggling actor who lives in New York City with his roommate and best friend, Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry), and hangs out in a tight-knit group of his best friends: Chandler, Ross Geller (David Schwimmer), Monica Geller (Courteney Cox), Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston), and Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow). He lived with a few other roommates when Chandler moved out to move in with Monica.

Joey once mentioned being 13 in 1981. He is from Queens, New York and is Catholic. Joey comes from a working-class Italian-American family of eight children, of which he is the only boy. His father Joseph Tribbiani Sr. (Robert Costanzo), is a pipefitter, and his mother&#x27;s name is Gloria (Brenda Vaccaro). Joey has seven sisters: Mary Therese (Mimi Lieber on &quot;Friends&quot;) a.k.a. Mary Teresa (Christina Ricci on &quot;Joey&quot;), Mary Angela (Holly Gagnier), Dina (Lisa Melilli in &quot;The One Where Chandler Can&#x27;t Remember Which Sister&quot;, Marla Sokoloff in &quot;The One with Monica&#x27;s Boots&quot;), Gina (K.J. Steinberg on &quot;Friends&quot;, Drea de Matteo on &quot;Joey&quot;), Tina (Lisa Maris), Veronica (Dena Miceli), and Cookie (Alex Meneses). As a child, he was extremely accident-prone. In &quot;The One with Ross&#x27; New Girlfriend&quot;, it was implied that he was sexually abused by his tailor but did not realize it until Chandler went to the same tailor.

Joey is portrayed as promiscuous and dim-witted but good-natured, as well as very loyal, caring, and protective of his friends. The writers of &quot;Friends&quot; did no intend on his character to be stupid but Matt Leblanc played &quot;dim-witted&quot; so well that it became a part of the character. He is a food-loving womanizer who has had more luck with dates than any of the other group members. In contrast to his persona as the &quot;ladies&#x27; man&quot;, he has also a marked childish side. He enjoys playing video games and foosball, loves sandwiches and pizza, and is a big fan of &quot;Baywatch&quot; and &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;. As a struggling actor, he is constantly looking for work. He was ordained as a minister in &quot;The One with the Truth About London&quot; and officiated at both Monica and Chandler&#x27;s and Phoebe and Mike&#x27;s weddings.

He does not like sharing food, especially when it is pizza, and has difficulty with even simple mathematics. In sports, Joey likes the New York Yankees in baseball, New York Knicks in basketball, New York Giants in football, and the New York Rangers in hockey.

Joey Tribbiani is a member of the Screen Actors Guild, having refused to follow in his father&#x27;s foot steps and become a pipefitter. He started his acting profession doing stage work, introduced in the show&#x27;s pilot episode by Monica and Chandler having seen Joey in a production of &quot;Pinocchio&quot;. Sometime before the start of the series, Joey also had appeared in a porn film, as a fully clothed extra. Joey also mentioned appearing in a play with trolls before getting the leading role of Sigmund Freud in the musical play &quot;Freud!&quot;, where he was first spotted by his talent agent Estelle Leonard. She immediately got him a film role in the same episode as Al Pacino&#x27;s &quot;butt double&quot; – a speechless role he later lost due to taking the part too seriously. By then, he said, he had been doing &quot;nothing but crappy plays for six years&quot;. Monica and Chandler also once discussed having seen Joey in a version of &quot;Macbeth&quot;, in which he was unable to pronounce most of the words.

== Season 1 ==
Joey becomes an &quot;actor-slash-model&quot; when he appears on print ads for the NYC Free Clinic, as a man named &quot;Mario&quot; who has a venereal disease. He also did an infomercial for a device that allows milk to be poured out of milk cartons; he played &quot;Kevin&quot;, a man who had extreme difficulty opening the cartons without the use of the device. (&quot;Kevin&quot; also inadvertently choked on a cookie during the show). This haunted him again when he appeared in the play &quot;The King&quot;, where he was made fun of due to choking on a cookie.

== Season 2 ==
In Season Two, Joey continued his stage work, appearing as &quot;The King&quot; in a poorly reviewed (and never-named) play. Published reviews of his performance claimed he was &quot;disturbingly unskilled&quot; and that he achieved &quot;brilliant new levels of sucking&quot; in a &quot;mediocre play&quot; with &quot;mindless, adolescent direction&quot;. Only days after these reviews came out, Joey gets his big break when he lands his first major role as Dr. Drake Ramoray on the soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, a real-life television show outside of the context of &quot;Friends&quot; which featured Jennifer Aniston&#x27;s father John. In-universe, Joey had initially gone in to read for a one-shot role as a cab driver; it is implied that he got the recurring role of Ramoray by sleeping with the casting director. While still playing Ramoray, he also appears in a bit role as a dead man in the film &quot;Outbreak 2: The Virus Takes Manhattan&quot;, starring Jean-Claude Van Damme. (Originally his character was only dying in the scene but due to Joey overacting, it was changed to him being already dead.)

Several episodes later, Joey costs himself the &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; gig when during an interview with &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot;, he radically overstates and claims he writes most of his own lines. This angers the show&#x27;s writers, who out of spite, &quot;kill off&quot; his character by having Dr. Ramoray fall down an elevator shaft. Joey takes this hard and admits that his role on &quot;Days&quot; was the best thing that ever happened to him.

== Season 3 ==
He goes back to stage acting in season 3 appearing in a play called &quot;Boxing Day&quot; opposite love interest Kate Miller. The play seems to start out as a conventional drama but ends with Joey&#x27;s character &quot;Victor&quot; being taken from his apartment by aliens. In Season Four, he lands a small one-scene movie role as a cop, playing his scene opposite Charlton Heston.

Some of Joey&#x27;s other jobs have included selling Christmas trees, dressing as Santa Claus and as a Christmas elf, working as a tour guide at the Museum of Natural History where Ross worked, offering perfume samples to customers at a department store, and as a Roman warrior at Caesar&#x27;s Palace in Las Vegas.

Joey is also briefly employed at Central Perk as a waiter. Facing a dry spell in his career as an actor, Joey is persuaded by Gunther, the manager, to take a job serving coffee. At first, Joey tries to hide his new job from his friends, but they eventually figure it out. He does not like the work but, true to his nature, soon finds a way to use his position to meet and ingratiate himself to attractive women by giving them free food, although Gunther quickly puts a stop to it. Joey doesn&#x27;t take his job seriously and spends a lot of his working hours sitting and talking to his friends. Eventually, he is fired for closing the coffeehouse in the middle of the day to go to an audition while Gunther was running a personal errand. Rachel later persuades Gunther to give Joey back his job, but once Joey finds more steady acting jobs he eventually just stops showing up. His absence is barely noticed. In a later episode, Joey realizes he forgot to tell Gunther he quit; Gunther replies that he would have eventually fired him anyway.

== Season 5 ==
Joey had some bad luck in terms of his acting career. In Season Five, he is cast in the independent film &quot;Shutter Speed&quot;, but it is shut down before filming began in Las Vegas. He was also fired from a Burger King commercial. He filmed a role in a &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; episode that was cut from the completed episode—Joey was only &quot;seen&quot; as a corpse in a body bag.

== Seasons 6 and 7 ==
In seasons 6 and 7, he lands a starring role as Detective &quot;Mac&quot; Machiavelli in a short-lived and bad cop show called &quot;Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.&quot;, which Chandler described as &quot;one of the worst things ever... and not just on TV.&quot; Joey had high hopes for the series, however &quot;Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.&quot; was canceled halfway through its first season.

In Season 7, Joey auditions for the role of Dr. Striker Ramoray, a new character on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; and Drake Ramoray&#x27;s brother, but he doesn&#x27;t get that role. Eventually, Joey&#x27;s luck turns when he gets back his role as Dr. Drake Ramoray and is even nominated for an award for Best Returning Character, first as a character in a coma, then revived through a brain transplant with another character, Jessica Lockhart (played by Susan Sarandon).

In Season 7, he later replaces Lockhart as Dr. Drake &quot;Jessica&quot; Ramoray. Later, in the spin-off &quot;Joey&quot;, it turns out that he loses his role as Dr. Drake Ramoray and has to again hunt for a new job.

Later in season 7, Joey lands a supporting role as &quot;Tony&quot;, a soldier, in a major film opposite an Oscar-nominated actor named Richard Crosby (Gary Oldman). The film is a World War I period film entitled &quot;Over There&quot;. Later Chandler accompanies Joey to the premiere of the film.

== Appearance in other seasons ==
Joey is also briefly a sperm donor for a medical experiment; at the end, the hospital would pay any donor $700. This was later mentioned when Monica goes to a sperm bank. Joey finds to his dismay that his sperm is not popular.

He also works at the restaurant &quot;Alessandro&#x27;s&quot; where Monica is head chef, nicknaming himself &quot;Dragon&quot; while on the job. Monica hires him just so she can fire him to intimidate the other employees who pay her no respect, but he makes a lot of tips and backs out of the deal, only to realize how important his getting fired was to Monica. He then sets himself up to be fired the next day.

He spends one episode working with Chandler as an entry-level data processor. He treats the job like another acting role, in which he is &quot;Joseph the Processing Guy&quot; and creates a complex back-story for the character. Chandler begins to dislike the Joseph character when he starts showing up Chandler at work. Joey eventually leaves after Chandler pretends to be sleeping with Joey&#x27;s &quot;pretend wife&quot;.

Prior to Monica and Chandler&#x27;s wedding, when the two admit that they were having trouble finding someone to perform the ceremony, Joey volunteers for the role, subsequently getting himself ordained over the Internet to entitle him to perform the marriage. He has apparently retained this role until Season Ten when he performed the ceremony for Phoebe&#x27;s wedding.

Joey is characterized as a simple-minded but good-natured womanizer who loves food. He particularly loves meatball sub sandwiches. When asked if he would give up sex or food he had trouble deciding and kept blurting out sex or food, eventually yelling &quot;I want girls on bread!&quot;. In &quot;The One with the Ride Along&quot;, he appears to be saving Ross from a putative gunshot, when it was actually his meatball sandwich that he was trying to save; it just happened to be next to Ross. He also loves the &quot;Joey Special&quot; – two pizzas. His greed when it comes to food is also shown in the episode &quot;The One with the Birth Mother&quot; where he refuses to call Sarah the next day. When Phoebe asks why, Joey explains how Sarah broke his golden commandment on their date – not to share food. Phoebe&#x27;s shocked, to say the least, but Rachel admits to her how this is who Joey is. Nonetheless, Phoebe makes Joey go out with Sarah again, making him order extra fries should the need arise. Joey does so, but Sarah really wants to dig in his seafood platter, making him drop his plate to the floor in the process. He exclaims, &quot;Joey doesn&#x27;t share food&quot;, which she seems to understand. However, things change course when Joey wants to nibble at her chocolate torte. As he wouldn&#x27;t share his food with her, she reciprocates and warns him not to touch any of her desserts while she wanders off to take a call. When she arrives, her dessert is pretty much gone; Joey, with chocolate torte all over his face, is at peace with himself, and admits that he&#x27;s &quot;not even sorry!&quot;. In &quot;The One with the Cheap Wedding Dress,&quot; Ross implies that Joey eats a date&#x27;s food without her permission regularly.

Joey is something of an Idiot Savant in general, but capable of good ideas when the situation arises; this is alluded to in the episode &quot;The One Where Ross Dates a Student&quot;, when Chandler, referring to Joey, says &quot;A hot girl&#x27;s at stake and suddenly he&#x27;s Rain Man&quot; when Joey suggested Ross work out who among his students called him the &#x27;hottie of the paleontology department&#x27; by comparing the handwriting of the note to the handwriting in the class essays. In another example, Joey made up an anecdote referred to as the &quot;Europe story&quot; or the &quot;magic story&quot;; apparently, anyone who hears it will immediately want to have sex with the teller. This is proven to be effective when Rachel successfully uses the story on Ross.

Being a glutton when it comes to food, Joey is shown throughout the series to have the uncanny ability to eat enormous quantities of food. As he prides the Tribbiani family for their eating prowess (&quot;We might not be [...] world leaders, but damn it, we can eat!&quot;), he takes on Monica&#x27;s challenge to eat a whole roast turkey virtually all by himself. In season 8, episode 9, Monica is unwilling to cook a whole roast turkey for Thanksgiving dinner as Rachel is pregnant, Chandler refuses to eat Thanksgiving food due to childhood traumas, Phoebe is a vegetarian, and dinner guest Will (played by Brad Pitt) is on a diet. Joey&#x27;s love for Thanksgiving traditions, however, convinces Monica to roast the turkey only under the condition that Joey can eat the entire 19-pound bird in one sitting. When Monica sees him struggle, she says she is only kidding, but Joey perseveres and with a little help from Phoebe&#x27;s maternity pants, he eventually not only consumes the entire turkey but has room for dessert afterward. A similar eating stunt happens in season 9, episode 5 when Joey is left alone at the dinner table in a restaurant after Phoebe&#x27;s failed birthday dinner, and he is forced to eat six meals by himself. He finishes them, only to tuck them into the birthday cake afterward.

Joey is extremely promiscuous, often relying on his catchphrase pickup line &quot;How &quot;you&quot; doin&#x27;?&quot;. He regularly sleeps with attractive women, but can never seem to get into a committed relationship – judging from a conversation he had with Chandler at the latter&#x27;s bachelor party he seems to regard marriage as depressing and restrictive. He sleeps with many of the interns and extras on shows on which he works. He has apparently been sexually active for a long time; he undid a 16-year-old girl&#x27;s bra when he was nine, slept with his teacher in the seventh grade, and had a &quot;wild spring break&quot; when he was 13. In the episode &quot;The One with Joey&#x27;s Interview&quot;, he sleeps with the interviewer (played by Sasha Alexander) so what he said about not watching soap operas doesn&#x27;t get published in &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot;.

Despite his promiscuous nature towards many women throughout the series, he is highly protective and old-fashioned when it comes to the relationships of his own sisters. While he does not seem to have a problem with his own lifestyle, he repeatedly makes sure his sisters don&#x27;t go down the same path. When he finds out in season 3, episode 11 that Chandler drunkenly made out with his sister Mary Angela, he attempts to force the two into a relationship. Later, in season 8, episode 10, Joey initially attempts to force his younger sister Dina into marriage with her hapless boyfriend upon hearing she&#x27;s pregnant, but they play into his emotional nature by saying they want to raise the baby independently.

While he is not very bright, Joey is a caring and kindhearted person. He lets Rachel live with him when she is fighting with Ross, financially supports Monica and Chandler, and helps Phoebe find work when she is unemployed. He is willing to marry Phoebe and Rachel on separate occasions he finds out that each is pregnant. Joey is also the most physically powerful of the group, being able to easily push Ross over a couch with only one hand, and offering to go to the coffee house to intimidate two bullies into leaving Ross and Chandler alone.

He is a Stephen King fan, having read &quot;The Shining&quot; several times, as well as being a fan of the film adaptation of one of King&#x27;s novels, &quot;Cujo&quot;. He also becomes a fan of the classic novel, &quot;Little Women&quot; after Rachel asks him to read it to see if it was better than &quot;The Shining&quot;. Joey briefly mentions to the gang that Al Pacino is his idol. Joey has the poster for the 1983 Al Pacino film &quot;Scarface&quot; in his bedroom and the same poster is seen in his house in &quot;Joey&quot;. Joey, Ross and Chandler are huge fans of &quot;Die Hard&quot;.

He moved apartments four times in the series. The first time, he moved to his own lavish apartment away from Chandler (with whom the psychotic Eddie moved in) after he got the role as Dr. Drake Ramoray on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, though he moved back soon afterward due to his loss of the role. The other times are when he and Chandler move into what is usually Monica&#x27;s apartment, after winning it from her in a game in &quot;The One with the Embryos&quot;. They are later forced back to their own apartment by the girls.

Although Joey dates several women in the series, very few of these relationships are serious, his romantic partners rarely appear for more than one episode. However, despite his great interest in women, Joey has made it clear more than once that his friends are more important to him; when his latest relationship, Janine (Elle Macpherson), stated that she dislikes Monica and Chandler, Joey breaks it off with her despite the fact that he had been trying to win her over for the previous four episodes. He tells Janine that Monica and Chandler are like family, and he can&#x27;t be with her if she doesn&#x27;t like them.

Joey was originally dismissed by Chandler when he came in for a roommate interview (in favor of Eric, a fashion photographer, who apologetically informs Chandler that, due to his work, models will have to come to the apartment, and that his sister - a porn actress - has a beach house Chandler is welcome to use), and Joey thought Chandler was gay. However, when Eric came back into the building to move in, he was confronted by Mr. Heckles, a senile building resident who claimed to be Chandler&#x27;s new roommate, causing Eric to leave and Chandler to go with his second choice Joey (In &quot;The One with the Flashback&quot; set in 1993, Joey moved in three years before, although in &quot;The One with All the Thanksgivings&quot; it shows that the gang knew Joey was Chandler&#x27;s roommate in 1992 and he would have been his roommate for quite some time). Joey&#x27;s first couple of days involved a brief, mutual attraction to Monica. This subsided and Chandler and Joey quickly became best friends as Joey&#x27;s carefree lifestyle grew on Chandler.

Later in the series, they bought a chick and a duck together, whom Chandler had named Yasmine and Dick, respectively. A long-running gag depicted Joey and Chandler occasionally fighting with each other like an old married couple. Joey moved out temporarily when he found success playing Dr. Drake Ramoray on a soap opera, but soon moved back in after his character was dropped down an elevator shaft. At the end of the series, Chandler and Monica made it clear to Joey that their new house outside the city would have a room for him.

While Joey is best friends with Chandler, Ross is a close second (although Ross has been referred to as his best friend several times). At a time when Joey and Chandler had problems when Chandler had kissed Joey&#x27;s girlfriend, Joey stopped acting as Chandler&#x27;s best friend and replaced him with Ross, although this only lasted until Chandler spent Thanksgiving in a box in order to show his remorse and apologize to him. Joey and Chandler have remained best friends ever since.

Furthermore, Joey and Ross share a moment in an episode after watching &quot;Die Hard&quot; all night. They fall asleep on Ross&#x27; couch, which is evidently enjoyed by Joey, as he tries to coerce Ross into more nap sessions with him. Also, earlier in the series, after much persuading by Joey, Ross gives in and kisses him to help him practice kissing men. In response, Joey replies that the audition was already over, he had not gotten the part, but the kiss was very well received, and &quot;Rachel is one lucky girl&quot;.

==Relationships==
The major development of their relationship was when Joey fell in love with Rachel, Ross&#x27;s ex-girlfriend, and Ross&#x27;s love interest since the ninth grade. When Joey goes on to tell Ross about it, he cannot say it in his face and instead says that he loves his &quot;friend&#x27;s&quot; ex-girlfriend. When asked if that &quot;friend&quot; (Ross) is a good guy, Joey honestly answers &quot;Yeah...He&#x27;s the best.&quot; Initially, it causes a major rift, with Joey being apologetic, but when Ross sees Joey truly in love with Rachel, he gives him the go-ahead. Ross basically says that he is not okay with it but he wants to be, and the two&#x27;s friendship deepens due to Joey&#x27;s refusal to date Rachel unless Ross okays the deal. However, Joey and Rachel do not date long, and later, Joey encourages Ross to pursue Rachel in the season finale.

Joey and Monica are close friends often joking around with each other. Joey allowed Monica to hire and fire him to prove to her employees that she was not a pushover. When he discovered that Monica and Chandler had developed a romantic relationship, he agreed to keep it secret until the two were ready to reveal it to the rest of their group. In an episode where he sees how close Chandler and Monica are, he dreams of himself and Monica in the same way. This later causes him to act weird around Monica. Finally, he reveals this to Chandler and Monica, it is that he wants a relationship like that, but Monica finds it nice thinking Joey thought of the two of them together. He also called Chandler moments after suspecting Monica of having an affair with a mystery male he had heard in her apartment. When Monica and Chandler needed their Engagement Picture taken, Chandler could not smile. In the newspaper announcement, it showed the photo was of Monica and Joey.

Joey always enjoyed a close relationship with Monica, Rachel, and Phoebe; LeBlanc once speculated that Joey saw the girls as sisters more than potential romantic interests. However, the tension between Monica and Joey is at times fairly obvious, and it is made clear that the two have a very close, almost intimate, relationship, though it is never consummated on the show. According to the DVD commentary of the pilot episode, Joey and Monica were initially meant to be the principal love connection of the show but were overshadowed by the Ross-Rachel relationship. In Episode 1.07 &quot;The One with the Blackout,&quot; Phoebe blurted to Joey that Monica had a crush on him when he was moving in with Chandler. In the Season 3 episode &quot;The One with the Flashback&quot;, an instant attraction appears to form between Joey and Monica when they first meet (to the point that Monica silently thanks Chandler for choosing him as a roommate), but after Monica invites Joey inside her apartment for some juice and Joey misinterprets it as Monica wanting sex and subsequently undressing in front of her, she is put off and they instead remain friends. This idea was revisited in Season 7 when it is revealed that Monica initially meant to hit on Joey in London, and not Chandler. She states that it was because she was looking for something meaningless, never expecting to have found Chandler and fall in love with him. The concept of what their marriage would have been like was then envisioned by Phoebe and it consisted of Monica cooking constantly for an obese Joey.

Phoebe is Joey&#x27;s female best friend. They appear to understand each other. They are the only members of the group who lack a college education. Joey is Phoebe&#x27;s best male friend; in &quot;The One with All the Cheesecakes&quot;, it is shown that they have dinner together once a month to talk about the rest of the group and Joey once tried to get Phoebe to call him &#x27;Big Daddy&#x27; in that same episode. Both characters show a softness for each other, even when joking or when they are upset with the others. In &quot;The One with the Race Car Bed&quot;, it is implied that Phoebe can hear Joey&#x27;s thoughts. In &quot;The One with the Ride Along&quot;, she explains that &quot;when the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all... not you, Joey&quot;. In the episode &quot;The One in Vegas&quot;, after Joey has said that no one will live in his hand-shaped mansion, he adds &quot;Except you, Pheebs...you can live in the thumb.&quot; When she was a surrogate mother for her brother&#x27;s triplets and suddenly craved meat, Joey offered to eat no meat until the babies were born, to compensate for her consumption and, in a way, preserve her vegetarianism (no extra animals would have to be killed). When Phoebe was upset because she&#x27;d turned thirty-one without having had the perfect kiss, Joey kissed her so that she could cross that off her list (also adding that he was one-sixteenth Portuguese when she mentioned that she hadn&#x27;t met any Portuguese people). Joey did not have romantic feelings for Phoebe. Joey dates briefly Phoebe&#x27;s twin sister Ursula, which upsets Phoebe; he breaks it off to preserve his friendship with Phoebe, however. When Monica finds out that Joey &quot;sees a friend in a different way&quot;, she assumes it to be Phoebe. Phoebe, overwhelmed by the news, approaches Joey, only to find that it is Rachel. Phoebe also has Joey locked in as a backup for her marriage.

When the Friends believe that the group may have to split up, Phoebe and Rachel conspire to form a separate group by themselves, but Phoebe insists that Joey be invited to their new group as well. Phoebe&#x27;s loyalty is proved again when she states that she could live in Las Vegas, since it has everything she needs, &quot;Including Joey!&quot;. He, in turn, invites her to live with him in the mansion he expected to own when he becomes rich from having a hand twin.

When Joey learned from a customer at Central Perk that Phoebe was apparently a porn star, he refused to watch the movies even when the other four decided to do so. However, he shows a new interest in them when he learned that the film actually stars Ursula.

When Joey believes Phoebe to be pregnant, he proposes, claiming the world is too scary for a single mother. This proposal is apparently made entirely without romantic intentions. Phoebe says yes and accepts his ring, but Monica tells Joey that it is Rachel who is pregnant, so Joey proposes to Rachel and must retrieve the ring from a reluctant Phoebe.

Phoebe also sets up Joey with many of her friends. On a double date, Joey sets her up with a stranger, Mike (Paul Rudd), whom she eventually marries.

In one episode, after persuasion from Rachel, he reads &quot;Little Women&quot; and she reads &quot;The Shining.&quot; She finds out that whenever he gets scared whilst reading he puts the book in the freezer. At the end of the episode, Joey is afraid that one of the characters is going to die and Rachel says, &quot;Do you want to put it in the freezer?&quot; Their close friendship continues and when a fire destroys Rachel and Phoebe&#x27;s apartment, Rachel moves in with Joey and stays there, even after her apartment has been repaired.

Halfway through season 8, Joey and Rachel go out on a date so that Rachel can have one night of fun before it becomes too obvious that she&#x27;s pregnant. They have a great time, and afterward, Joey starts developing feelings for Rachel. He does not act on his feelings out of loyalty to Ross. However, upon discovering Joey&#x27;s feelings for Rachel, Ross encourages his friend to talk to her. Joey tells Rachel about his feelings, but she does not return them, and things are awkward between them for a while, but they quickly reconcile.

Towards the end of season 9, Rachel starts developing feelings for Joey, but fears he does not feel the same way anymore and has already moved on, especially when he starts dating Ross&#x27; colleague Charlie Wheeler (Aisha Tyler). When the gang goes to Barbados for a convention from Ross&#x27; work, Joey finds out about Rachel&#x27;s feelings, and even though he first says nothing can happen, he changes his mind when he sees Charlie and Ross kiss, and he goes back to Rachel&#x27;s room to be with her. They continue their relationship for several episodes and gain Ross&#x27; approval after he realizes that it has been six years since his relationship with Rachel ended, and he should move on from that. When Rachel and Joey prepare for their first night together, however, they realize they are too close as friends to make their relationship work, with Rachel instinctively slapping Joey away when he tries to touch her as she suddenly finds herself unable to get past the fact that it&#x27;s Joey touching her. After Chandler mentions how natural it was for him and Monica to make the transition from friends to lovers, Joey and Rachel realize they are not on the same path and go back to being friends. At the end, when Chandler and Monica announce that they are moving into a house, Joey presents them with a housewarming gift of a chick and a duck, that are named Chick Jr. and Duck Jr. The pets remain in Joey&#x27;s apartment but were presumably given away to a shelter when Joey moved to LA.

Soon after Chandler and Monica move out, Joey moves to LA to focus on his acting career. That was the last time the six best friends are portrayed hanging out together.

==&quot;Joey&quot;==
After the final season of &quot;Friends&quot;, Joey becomes the main character of &quot;Joey&quot;, a spin-off/sequel series, where he moves to L.A. to polish his acting career. His sister Gina Tribbiani (Drea de Matteo) and his nephew Michael (Paulo Costanzo) are two other central characters in the show.

Joey turns down a role in a sitcom called &quot;Nurses&quot; to star in a different series pilot. His pilot does not get picked up, while &quot;Nurses&quot; becomes a huge hit. However, his acting career has had some better moments. In &quot;Joey&quot;, it is revealed that Joey&#x27;s character of Dr. Drake Ramoray dies again on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; where he is stabbed by a nurse (&quot;Joey and the Wrong Name&quot;). He wins a Daytime Soap Award for &quot;Best Death Scene&quot;. In later &quot;Joey&quot; episodes, Joey lands a starring role on the prime time soap &quot;Deep Powder&quot;. When he gets fired from that job, he bounces back by snagging a leading role in the big-budget action picture &quot;Captured&quot;. He also becomes close friends with fellow actor Zach Miller (Miguel A. Núñez Jr.), and at the premiere of &quot;Captured&quot;, he repairs his strained relationship with his father.

Throughout the series, Joey develops a complicated on-off relationship with Alex Garrett (Andrea Anders), his next-door neighbor and property manager. They become good friends upon meeting and Alex confides her problems with her marriage in Joey. At the end of season one, she and Joey become romantically involved during her separation from her husband. In season two she becomes romantically interested in Joey and has a crush on him for a long period. Gina tries to help her to get over Joey, but once Alex starts dating Joey&#x27;s friend Dean, Joey soon realizes that he is also in love with Alex, and they slowly form a committed relationship. In the series finale, Joey becomes concerned over believing that Alex is planning for marriage too early in their relationship, only to become upset when she says she does not want to marry again. When the two argue about the situation, Alex compares his attitude to him not wanting a piece of broccoli until the second she denies it from him. This argument culminates in them nearly marrying out of spite until they make up when he admits to her that she is the first girl he has ever wanted to marry. At the end of the episode, Alex gives Joey back the piece of broccoli, implying that she may be changing her mind about marrying again.

<text>Julian Lincoln Simon (February 12, 1932 – February 8, 1998) was an American economist. He was a professor of economics and business administration at the University of Illinois from 1963 to 1983 before later moving to the University of Maryland, where he taught for the remainder of his academic career.

Simon wrote many books and articles, mostly on economic subjects, from an optimistic viewpoint. He is best known for his work on population, natural resources, and immigration. Simon is sometimes associated with cornucopian views and as a critic of Malthusianism. Rather than focus on the abundance of nature, Simon focused on lasting economic benefits from continuous population growth, even despite limited or finite physical resources, primarily by the power of human ingenuity to create substitutes, and from technological progress.

He is also known for the famous Simon–Ehrlich wager, a bet he made with ecologist Paul R. Ehrlich. Ehrlich bet that the prices for five metals would increase over a decade, while Simon took the opposite stance. Simon won the bet, as the prices for the metals sharply declined during that decade.

== Early life and education ==
Simon was born in Newark, New Jersey, on February 12, 1932. He grew up in a Jewish family that migrated to Newark as part of a wave of Jews who moved into the suburbs. His grandparents owned a hardware store in the city&#x27;s downtown. In 1941, he moved with his parents to Millburn, New Jersey, where they experienced significant financial insecurity. At the age of 12, Simon became estranged from his father, who he saw as distant &quot;except when I did something that annoyed him.&quot; He developed a closer relationship with his mother and two aunts. Reflecting on his childhood, Simon later recalled that he had &quot;little joy&quot; and fewer &quot;celebrations and happy moments.&quot;

At age 14, Simon joined the Boy Scouts of America and became an Eagle Scout. His experience being hazed as a scout influenced a worldview which disliked elitism and sympathized with what he described as &quot;the struggling poor, the powerless, and those denied opportunity by circumstance.&quot; He was educated at the local Millburn High School. In his autobiography, &quot;A Life Against the Grain&quot;, Simon wrote that &quot;I first learned to say ‘Do you want to bet?’&quot; when arguing with his father. &quot;He would say outrageously wrong things in an authoritative fashion and refuse to hear any questions. There really was nothing I could say except ‘Do you want to bet?’&quot; 

Simon studied experimental psychology as an undergraduate at Harvard University, where he also took graduate courses in the subject and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in 1953. At Harvard, Simon was a member of its Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps program and attended on a full scholarship provided by the Holloway Plan. He was also active as a member of the university&#x27;s debate team. To help defray his expenses, Simon worked various jobs—including those as a salesman, clerk, and factory worker—and used his winnings from daily poker games. Among his close friends in college was sculptor Aristides Demetrios.

From 1953 to 1956, Simon served as an officer in the U.S. Navy on USS &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot;. He was also stationed at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina for the U.S. Marine Corps. In 1957, he began graduate studies at the University of Chicago, where he received a Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) in 1959 and a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in business economics in 1961. He came under the influence of economists Milton Friedman, Friedrich Hayek, and Theodore Schultz, who were all based at the university.

== Career ==
From 1961 to 1963, Simon operated Julian Simon Associates, an agency for mail-orders and advertising. He had moved to New York with his wife, Rita James, to start a business. However, he complained of his encounters with regulatory restrictions, which he called &quot;tyranny of bureaucracy.&quot; Simon resolved to write a book about direct mail and sought an academic position. During a time of rapid expansion among universities, he obtained a position as a professor of advertising at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. His time owning a personal business would have an effect on his economic perspectives.

Simon would spend most of his adult life in academia. He published widely on topics concerning advertising and marketing, later broadly researching subjects from library storage to suicide to airline overbooking. At the University of Illinois, he switched in 1966 to teach marketing there. His research focuses also shifted towards addressing population growth. Simon used his previous experience in marketing towards promoting birth control; articles he published recommended campaigns for family planning. He drew the attention of W. Parker Mauldin of the Population Council, who arranged for him to visit India to research possible ways to advertise birth control. His initial assumptions held that an increasing population were accompanied by serious economic threats. After calculating the costs and benefits of family planning, he concluded that countries could gain financially by averting births and advocated stronger investments in planning programs.

Essays by economists Simon Kuznets and Richard Easterlin in 1967 greatly influenced Simon, who began to be increasingly skeptical about the implications of population growth as he researched fertility rates. Kuznets and Easterlin argued that the historical data demonstrated that population growth had no negative effect on economic growth; Simon credited their findings as leading to his skeptic outlook. He also came to be influenced by Danish economist Ester Boserup, who found that, in contrast to Thomas Malthus, a growing population determined the most efficient agricultural practices. During a 1969 visit to Washington, D.C., Simon experienced an epiphany at the Marine Corps War Memorial. He later wrote: &quot;And then I thought, Have I gone crazy? What business do I have trying to help arrange it that fewer human beings will be born, each one of whom might be a Mozart or a Michelangelo or an Einstein—or simply a joy to his or her family and community and a person who will enjoy life?&quot;

In February 1970, Simon took the place of psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton to speak at a faculty forum in his home city of Urbana, Illinois. His talk was titled &quot;Science Does Not Show There Is Over-Population.&quot; He declared, &quot;I view the population explosion not as a disaster, but as a triumph for mankind. Whether population growth is too fast or too slow is a value judgment, not a scientific one.&quot; The talk gained attention among his colleagues, and he was invited to speak at the 1970 Earth Day in Urbana. Simon spoke to a large audience; after Planned Parenthood president Alan Frank Guttmacher finished giving his address, Simon delivered his skeptical view questioning whether growth and scarcity posed a threat to society. Biology professor and colleague Paul Silverman soon rose to the podium and denounced Simon&#x27;s remarks, while Simon was beside him. Silverman called him a &quot;false prophet&quot; who &quot;lacks scholarship or substance.&quot; The event stayed with Simon, who now held a grudge against Silverman. Two weeks later, he soused Silverman at a faculty party and the two scuffled. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote in 1985 that the incident launched Simon&#x27;s &quot;intellectual war.&quot;

In 1969, Simon was named as a professor of economics and business administration at the University of Illinois, and would remain in that position until 1983. From 1970–71 and 1974–75, he was a visiting professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In the early 1970s, Simon&#x27;s academic work largely concerned the relationship between population and fertility. He wrote primarily in economic, demographic, and developmental journals. By 1975, his published articles argued that there were economic gains from population growth, contrary to assumptions that growth lead to reduced investment. They came amid growing fears by environmental activists, who drew from biologist Paul R. Ehrlich&#x27;s 1968 book, &quot;The Population Bomb&quot;, and the Club of Rome&#x27;s 1972 report, &quot;The Limits to Growth&quot;. By then, the view of scarcity among economists such as Simon, Robert Solow, and William Nordhaus differed from ecologists. Economists posited that scarcity was a changing, dynamic variable rather than the more commonly espoused view among scientists that it was a constraint which caused an ecological collapse.

Simon took an aggressive approach in attacking what had been the dominant consensus on population growth. He issued rhetorical challenges that distinguished him from and went further than other economists. A stronger belief in the free market also set him apart from Nordhaus and Solow, who were part of the mainstream. Political progressives and environmentalists saw his views as being overly-optimistic. Even as environmental pessimists gained greater influence in policy decisions under President Jimmy Carter, Simon and other optimists intensified their criticisms of population control and environmental regulations.

Simon moved in 1983 to join the faculty of the University of Maryland, College Park, as a professor in its Robert H. Smith School of Business, where he remained for the rest of his academic career. He was a member of the American Economics Association, the American Statistics Association, and the Population Association of America.

==Wagers with Ehrlich==
Simon and Paul R. Ehrlich first directly encountered each other in the summer of 1980, when Simon vehemently debunked claims by &quot;Newsweek&quot; and the United Nations, both of which had overestimated the death toll caused by a drought in West Africa from 1968 to 1973. His rebuttals, published in &quot;Science&quot; journal and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, were also aimed at environmental doomers. Simon rejected Ehrlich&#x27;s claim in &quot;The Population Bomb&quot; that limited food supply may necessarily require population control and also rejected that humanity was reaching its ecological limit, a claim popularized by &quot;The Limits of Growth&quot;. He blamed the popularity for such exaggerated assertions as &quot;bad news sells books, newspapers, and magazines.&quot; Simon explained that technological advancements would alleviate scarcity because &quot;we find new lodes, invent better production methods, and discover new substitutes.&quot;

In December 1980, Ehrlich and his wife, Anne Ehrlich, along with colleagues John Holdren and John Harte, issued criticisms in &quot;Science&quot; of Simon&#x27;s rebuttals. Arguing that technology was not sufficient to replace essential ecological systems, they asserted that a scarcity of energy and minerals remained a present danger. They dismissed Simon&#x27;s writing as being a &quot;tired old argument&quot; with &quot;striking misconceptions&quot; which reflected economists &quot;who know nothing about geology.&quot; Biologist Wayne Davis at the University of Kentucky disputed a claim made by Simon&#x27;s article that oil prices would decrease, saying it &quot;defies logic.&quot; Ehrlich and Simon&#x27;s dispute would continue into the next year, with additional publications against each other in &quot;Social Science Quarterly&quot;. Simon wrote in 1981, &quot;How often does a prophet have to be wrong before we no longer believe that he or she is a true prophet?&quot;

Simon believed that Ehrlich&#x27;s assumptions about demographics were erroneous and that his public statements had not experienced the &quot;consequences of being wrong.&quot; In 1969, Ehrlich said that &quot;If I were a gambler, I would take even money that England will not exist in the year 2000.&quot; He predicted that in the absence of global population control, widespread nuclear war, disease, scarcity, or dire resource scarcity would occur as a result of overpopulation. Ehrlich garnered broad public attention for his views and disseminated his concerns in the &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;Penthouse&quot;, and on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, where he was a frequent guest and had at least 20 appearances. In 1970, Ehrlich delivered 100 public lectures and appeared on 200 radio and television shows. His highly publicized engagements earned him celebrity status as a scientist. Simon later recalled of Ehrlich: &quot;Here was a guy reaching a vast audience, leading his juggernaut of environmentalist hysteria, and I felt utterly helpless.&quot;

Wanting to &quot;put my money where my mouth is,&quot; Simon challenged Ehrlich to a scientific wager to test their theories regarding future resource abundance, betting on the future prices of raw material. If Ehrlich&#x27;s belief that population growth would increase scarcity was correct, then the prices of the metals would increase due to heightened demand. Simon believed that technological advancements would reduce scarcity and so he predicted a decrease in prices over time. Ehrlich agreed to the offer. He commented that he would accept Simon&#x27;s &quot;astonishing offer before other greedy people jump in.&quot; He consulted Harte and Holdren to devise a basket of five metals that they thought would rise in price with increasing scarcity and depletion. They chose chromium, copper, nickel, tin, and tungsten. Simon ultimately won the bet, with all five metals dropping in price.
* The price of tin went down because of an increased use of aluminium, a much more abundant, useful and inexpensive material.
* Better mining technologies allowed for the discovery of vast nickel lodes, which ended the near monopoly that was enjoyed on the market.
* Tungsten fell due to the rise of the use of ceramics in cookware.
* The price of chromium fell due to better smelting techniques.
* The price of copper began to fall due to the invention of fiber-optic cable (which is derived from sand), which serves a number of the functions once reserved only for copper wire.

In all of these cases, better technology allowed for either more efficient use of existing resources, or substitution with a more abundant and less expensive resource, as Simon predicted.

===Proposed second wager===
In 1995, Simon issued a challenge for a second bet. Ehrlich declined, and proposed instead that they bet on a metric for human welfare. Ehrlich offered Simon a set of 15 metrics over 10 years, victor to be determined by scientists chosen by the president of the National Academy of Sciences in 2005. There was no meeting of minds, because Simon felt that too many of the metric&#x27;s measured attributes of the world were not directly related to human welfare, e.g. the amount of nitrous oxide in the atmosphere. For such indirect, supposedly bad indicators to be considered &quot;bad&quot;, they would ultimately have to have some measurable detrimental effect on actual human welfare. Ehrlich refused to leave out measures considered by Simon to be immaterial.

Simon summarized the bet with the following analogy:

==Theory==
Simon&#x27;s 1981 book &quot;The Ultimate Resource&quot; is a criticism of what was then the conventional wisdom on resource scarcity, published within the context of the cultural background created by the best-selling and highly influential book &quot;The Population Bomb&quot; in 1968 by Paul R. Ehrlich and &quot;The Limits to Growth&quot; analysis published in 1972. &quot;The Ultimate Resource&quot; challenged the conventional wisdom on population growth, raw-material scarcity and resource consumption. Simon argues that our notions of increasing resource scarcity ignore the long-term declines in wage-adjusted raw material prices. Viewed economically, he argues, increasing wealth and technology make more resources available; although supplies may be limited physically they may be regarded as economically indefinite as old resources are recycled and new alternatives are assumed to be developed by the market. Simon challenged the notion of an impending Malthusian catastrophe—that an increase in population has negative economic consequences; that population is a drain on natural resources; and that we stand at risk of running out of resources through over-consumption. Simon argues that population is the solution to resource scarcities and environmental problems, since people and markets innovate. His ideas were praised by Nobel Laureate economists Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman, the latter in a 1998 foreword to &quot;The Ultimate Resource II&quot;, but they have also attracted critics such as Paul R. Ehrlich, Albert Allen Bartlett and Herman Daly.

Simon examined different raw materials, especially metals and their prices in historical times. He assumed that besides temporary shortfalls, in the long run prices for raw materials remain at similar levels or even decrease. E.g. aluminium was never as expensive as before 1886 and steel used for medieval armor carried a much higher price tag in current dollars than any modern parallel. A recent discussion of commodity index long-term trends supported his positions.

His 1984 book &quot;The Resourceful Earth&quot; (co-edited by Herman Kahn), is a similar criticism of the conventional wisdom on population growth and resource consumption and a direct response to the Global 2000 report. For example, it predicted that &quot;There is no compelling reason to believe that world oil prices will rise in the coming decades. In fact, prices may well fall below current levels&quot;. Indeed, oil prices trended downward for nearly the next 2 decades, before rising above 1984 levels in about 2003 or 2004. Oil prices have subsequently risen and fallen, and risen again. In 2008, the price of crude oil reached $100 per barrel, a level last attained in the 1860s (inflation adjusted). Later in 2008, the price again sharply fell, to a low of about $40, before rising again to a high around $125. Since mid-2011, prices were slowly trending downward until the middle of 2014, but falling dramatically until the end of 2015 to ca. $30. Since then prices were relatively stable (below $50).

Simon was skeptical, in 1994, of claims that human activity caused global environmental damage, notably in relation to CFCs, ozone depletion and climate change.

Simon also claimed that numerous environmental damage and health dangers from pollution were &quot;definitely disproved&quot;. These included lead pollution &amp; IQ, DDT, PCBs, malathion, Agent Orange, asbestos, and the chemical contamination at Love Canal. He dismissed such concerns as a mere &quot;value judgement.&quot;

===Influence===
Simon was one of the founders of free-market environmentalism.
An article entitled &quot;The Doomslayer&quot; profiling Julian Simon in &quot;Wired&quot; magazine inspired Danish Bjørn Lomborg to write the book &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot;.

Simon was also the first to suggest that airlines should provide incentives for travelers to give up their seats on overbooked flights, rather than arbitrarily taking random passengers off the plane (a practice known as &quot;bumping&quot;). Although the airline industry initially rejected it, his plan was later implemented with resounding success, as recounted by Milton Friedman in the foreword to &quot;The Ultimate Resource II&quot;. Economist James Heins said in 2009 that the practice had added $100 billion to the United States economy in the last 30 years. Simon gave away his idea to federal de-regulators and never received any personal profit from his solution.

Although not all of Simon&#x27;s arguments were universally accepted, they contributed to a shift in opinion in the literature on demographic economics from a strongly Malthusian negative view of population growth to a more neutral view. More recent theoretical developments, based on the ideas of the demographic dividend and demographic window, have contributed to another shift, this time away from the debate viewing population growth as either good or bad.

Simon wrote a memoir, &quot;A Life Against the Grain&quot;, which was published by his wife after his death.

== Criticism ==
Jared Diamond in his book &quot;Collapse&quot;, Albert Bartlett and Garrett Hardin describe Simon as being too optimistic and some of his assumptions being not in line with natural limitations.

Diamond claims that a continued stable growth rate of earth&#x27;s population would result in extreme over-population long before the suggested time limit. Regarding the attributed population predictions Simon did not specify that he was assuming a fixed growth rate as Diamond, Bartlett and Hardin have done. Simon argued that people do not become poorer as the population expands; increasing numbers produce what they needed to support themselves, and have and will prosper while food prices sink.

Diamond believes, and finds absurd, Simon implies it would be possible to produce metals, e.g. copper, from other elements. For Simon, human resource needs are comparably small compared to the wealth of nature. He therefore argued physical limitations play a minor role and shortages of raw materials tend to be local and temporary. The main scarcity pointed out by Simon is the amount of human brain power (i.e. &quot;The Ultimate Resource&quot;) which allows for the perpetuation of human activities for practically unlimited time. For example, before copper ore became scarce and prices soared due to global increasing demand for copper wires and cablings, the global data and telecommunication networks have switched to glass fiber backbone networks.

This and other quotations in &quot;Wired&quot; are supposed to be the reason for Bjørn Lomborg&#x27;s &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot;. Lomborg has stated that he began his research as an attempt to counter what he saw as Simons&#x27; anti-ecological arguments but changed his mind after starting to analyze the data.

Herman Daly, an American ecological and Georgist economist, criticized Simon for committing profound mistakes and exaggerations, for denial of resource finitude and for his views that neither ecology nor entropy exists.

==Legacy==
The Institute for the Study of Labor established the annual Julian L. Simon Lecture to honor Simon&#x27;s work in population economics. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign held a symposium discussing Simon&#x27;s work on April 24, 2002. The university also established the Julian Simon Memorial Faculty Scholar Endowment to fund an associate faculty member in the business school. India&#x27;s Liberty Institute also holds a Julian Simon Memorial Lecture. The Competitive Enterprise Institute gives the Julian Simon Memorial Award annually to an economist in the vein of Simon; the first recipient was Stephen Moore, who had served as a research fellow under Simon in the 1980s.

==Personal life==
Simon was remembered as a traditionalist Jew who did not work on the Sabbath. He emphasized empirical data in arguments and had a combative personality which enjoyed rhetorical exchanges. His wife, Rita James, was a former socialist activist; they met while students at the University of Chicago and married during that period. She was a longtime member of the faculty at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and later became a public affairs professor at American University. They had three children: David, Judith, and Daniel.

For a long time, Simon experienced debilitating depression, which allowed him to work only a few productive hours in a day. He also studied the psychology of depression and wrote a book on overcoming it. He died on February 8, 1998. The cause was a heart attack at his home in Chevy Chase in 1998; he died at age 65.

<text>Rachel Karen Green is a fictional character, one of the six main characters who appeared in the American sitcom &quot;Friends&quot;. Portrayed by Jennifer Aniston, the character was created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, and appeared in all of the show&#x27;s 236 episodes during its decade-long run, from its premiere on September 22, 1994, to its finale on May 6, 2004. Introduced in the show&#x27;s pilot as a naïve runaway bride who reunites with her childhood best friend Monica Geller and relocates to New York City, Rachel gradually evolves from a spoiled, inexperienced &quot;daddy&#x27;s girl&quot; into a successful businesswoman. During the show&#x27;s second season, the character becomes romantically involved with Monica&#x27;s brother, Ross, with whom she maintains a complicated on-off relationship throughout the series. Together, Ross and Rachel have a daughter, Emma.

The role of Rachel was originally offered to Téa Leoni, the producer&#x27;s first choice, and Courteney Cox, both of whom declined, Leoni in favor of starring in the sitcom &quot;The Naked Truth&quot;, and Cox in favor of playing Rachel&#x27;s best friend Monica in &quot;Friends&quot;. A virtually unknown actress at the time, who had previously starred in five short-lived sitcoms, Aniston auditioned for the role of Rachel after turning down an offer as a cast member on the sketch comedy show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. After acquiring the role and before &quot;Friends&quot; aired, Aniston was temporarily at risk of being recast because she had also been involved with another sitcom, &quot;Muddling Through&quot;, at the time, which was ultimately cancelled and allowed Aniston to remain on &quot;Friends&quot;.

Critical reception towards Rachel has remained consistently positive throughout &quot;Friends&quot;″ decade-long run, with &quot;The A.V. Club &quot;attributing much of the show&#x27;s early success to the character. However, some of her storylines have been criticized, specifically her romantic relationship with her friend Joey Tribbiani during season 10. Rachel&#x27;s popularity established her as the show&#x27;s breakout character, who has since been named one of the greatest television characters of all time, while the character&#x27;s second season haircut spawned an international phenomenon of its own. Named the &quot;Rachel&quot; after her, the character&#x27;s shag continues to be imitated by millions of women around the world and remains one of the most popular hairstyles in history, in spite of Aniston personally disliking it. Rachel is also regarded as a style icon due to her influence on womenswear during the 1990s. Meanwhile, the character&#x27;s relationship with Ross is often cited among television&#x27;s most beloved.

Rachel is considered to be Aniston&#x27;s breakout role, credited with making her the show&#x27;s most famous cast member and for spawning her successful film career. Praised for her performance as Rachel, Aniston won both an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series and a Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress In A Television Series – Comedy Or Musical.

== Role ==
Rachel Green is introduced in the pilot episode of &quot;Friends&quot; as a runaway bride who leaves her fiancé, Barry Farber, at the altar, and seeks refuge with her childhood friend Monica Geller (Courteney Cox) in New York City. Moving in with Monica, she meets Monica&#x27;s friends Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow), Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc), and Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry), while reacquainting with Monica&#x27;s brother Ross Geller (David Schwimmer), who has harbored romantic feelings for her since high school. Previously reliant on her parents’ wealth, Rachel begins her journey toward independence by working as a waitress at Central Perk, despite being notably unskilled at the job.

Rachel&#x27;s relationship with Ross is a central focus throughout the series. After learning Ross is in love with her at the end of the first season, she reciprocates but he has already begun dating someone else, initiating their on-again, off-again relationship that spans the entire show. Their relationship includes notable landmarks such as Ross choosing Rachel over his girlfriend at the time, Ross&#x27; frustration with Rachel&#x27;s busy work schedule and companionship with a male coworker, their breakup over a disagreement while they were on a &quot;break&quot; from dating each other, and several moments of both hostility towards each other and reconciliation. Ross marries his boss&#x27; niece Emily (Helen Baxendale) despite accidentally saying Rachel&#x27;s name during their wedding vows, but divorces Emily once she demands he stops being friends with Rachel. They drunkenly marry in Las Vegas during season five, eventually divorce after failing to have their marriage annulled, and later co-parent their daughter Emma, born in season eight following a one-night stand. In season nine, Rachel briefly dates Joey, but they end their relationship in season ten after realizing they are better as friends. Despite receiving a job offer in France, Rachel ultimately decides to stay in New York and rekindle her relationship with Ross in the series finale, de-boarding her flight at the last minute.

By the series&#x27; conclusion, Rachel achieves significant personal and professional growth. Her decision to reunite with Ross in the final episode brings her story full circle, solidifying her evolution from a dependent individual into a self-assured and independent woman. Post-series material, such as the spin-off &quot;Joey&quot;, suggests that she and Ross eventually remarry.

== Development ==
=== Conception and writing ===

After their short-lived television series &quot;Family Album&quot; was canceled, television writers David Crane and Marta Kauffman pitched &quot;Friends&quot; to then-NBC president Warren Littlefield as a sitcom about &quot;that special time in your life when your friends are your family,&quot; basing the show on their own experiences as young people living in New York; the main characters themselves were inspired by their own friends. Conceived as a young woman who is unprepared for adulthood, the character Rachel Green (occasionally spelled &quot;Greene&quot;) was originally named Rachel Robbins in the pilot. Although critics and audiences initially perceived Monica as the show&#x27;s main character when &quot;Friends&quot; premiered, the writers had actually given Rachel the pilot&#x27;s most prominent storyline. Before deciding that Rachel and Ross would be an item for the entire series, the writers had originally intended for the show&#x27;s defining couple to be Joey and Monica. However, after the success of the pilot, in which Rachel and Ross&#x27; developing romance is first hinted at, and witnessing Aniston and co-star David Schwimmer&#x27;s on-screen chemistry for the first time, Crane and Kauffman determined that the entire series relied on &quot;finding all the wonderful roadblocks for them to be with each other&quot;.

Audiences began rooting for Rachel and Ross&#x27; union from the very beginning of &quot;Friends&quot;, openly voicing their frustration with Rachel&#x27;s obliviousness to Ross&#x27; feelings for her. The episode that would ultimately transform the friends&#x27; relationship for the remainder of the series was the first-season finale &quot;The One Where Rachel Finds Out&quot;, in which Rachel finally learns of Ross&#x27; true feelings for her, at the same time discovering she actually feels the same. However, the episode nearly went unwritten because, at the time, few &quot;Friends&quot; writers were expecting the couple&#x27;s relationship to morph into the phenomenon that it ultimately became. The episode was first suggested by director James Burrows; the writers felt that it was time to alter the couple&#x27;s dynamic in order to avoid the repetitive &quot;he&#x27;s pining, she&#x27;s oblivious&quot; pattern, using the work of author Jane Austen as inspiration on how to finally shift the pining arc from Ross to Rachel. Because stakes for the episode were unprecedentedly high, &quot;The One Where Rachel Finds Out&quot; became &quot;Friends&quot;&#x27; most reworked episode. The couple&#x27;s first kiss at the end of season two&#x27;s &quot;The One Where Ross Finds Out&quot; was met with deafening applause from the studio audience. Crane admitted that keeping viewers interested in their relationship for ten years was challenging. Jonathan Bernstein of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; believes that they accomplished this by &quot;dangl[ing] the possibility of a Ross and Rachel recoupling through several cliffhangers without ever putting them back together&quot;. According to &quot;Encyclopedia of Television &quot;author Horace Newcomb, Ross and Rachel&#x27;s ever-changing relationship &quot;converted the traditional amnesic plotlines of the situation comedy into ones akin to episodic drama&quot;. Meanwhile, writing for &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, Elaine Blair agreed that &quot;Friends &quot; created &quot;a sense of chemistry between two characters while also putting obstacles in their way, setting us up for a long-deferred union&quot;.

After Rachel and Ross drunkenly get married while on vacation in Las Vegas during season five, Schwimmer had initially objected to the idea of having Ross divorce her – his third divorce – because he felt that it was taking it &quot;too far&quot;. The actor explained that &quot;The whole arc of the relationship was weird then ... because for [Ross] to be able to move on enough to marry someone else and then go back to being in love with Rachel later just went a bit too far.&quot; Rachel and Joey&#x27;s romantic storyline was conceived because the writers wanted to delay Ross and Rachel&#x27;s reunion further. Crane felt that pairing Rachel and Joey during season ten &quot;was for the greater good&quot; because &quot;it was inappropriate&quot;. However, the cast initially protested the idea, fearing that Rachel, Joey, and Ross would ultimately become unlikeable characters and audiences would either &quot;resent Joey for going after a pregnant woman, or resent Rachel for rejecting him, or resent Ross for standing between the two of them&quot;. Meanwhile, the writers also approached the concept of Rachel&#x27;s pregnancy and baby tentatively, worrying about how they would include it in the show because they did not want &quot;Friends&quot; &quot;to become a show about a baby&quot; while &quot;On the other hand, we don&#x27;t want to pretend that there isn&#x27;t one.&quot; According to Robert Bianco of &quot;USA Today&quot;, the critical success and popularity of Rachel&#x27;s pregnancy is ultimately responsible for &quot;propel[ling] the show to the top of the ratings&quot;. When it finally came time to write the series finale, &quot;The only thing [Crane and Kauffman] absolutely knew from very early on was that we had to get Ross and Rachel together,&quot; deciding, &quot;We had dicked the audience around for 10 years with their &#x27;will they or won&#x27;t they,&#x27; and we didn&#x27;t see any advantage in frustrating them&quot; any longer. However, at one point the writers had deliberated ending the series with Ross and Rachel in &quot;a gray area of where they aren&#x27;t together, but we hint there&#x27;s a sense that they might be down the road&quot;. Ultimately, Crane and Kauffman relented in favor of giving the audience what they wanted.

=== Casting ===
The final character to be cast, Rachel is portrayed by actress Jennifer Aniston, who auditioned for the role shortly after declining a position as a cast member on the sketch comedy show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Her decision was initially ridiculed by both her friends as well as actor Adam Sandler, a &quot;Saturday Night Live &quot;alum. Actress Téa Leoni, who at the time was being referred to by the media as &quot;the next Lucille Ball&quot;, was offered the role of Rachel as the studio&#x27;s first choice, but she declined in favor of starring in the sitcom &quot;The Naked Truth&quot;. Actress Elizabeth Berkley also auditioned for the role. Other actresses who auditioned for Rachel include Denise Richards, Melissa Rivers, Nicollette Sheridan, Parker Posey, and Jami Gertz. Originally, the producers wanted to cast actress Courteney Cox as Rachel, who Crane and Kauffman were particularly drawn to because of her &quot;cheery, upbeat energy&quot;. Additionally, Cox was the most famous cast member at the time amidst an ensemble of relatively unknown actors. However, the actress lobbied for the role of Rachel&#x27;s best friend Monica, as whom she was ultimately cast, because she felt that she was not &quot;quirky&quot; enough to play Rachel. At the same time, although unbeknownst to each other, Aniston was being considered for the role of Monica, but fought to play Rachel because she felt that the character suited her better. At one point, Cox had begun to regret her decision to play Monica until her own character&#x27;s storylines started improving.

&quot;Friends&quot; was Aniston&#x27;s sixth sitcom; each of her previous ventures had been canceled prematurely. Feeling vulnerable, Aniston had begun to doubt herself as an actress and personally approached Littlefield for reassurance on her career, who encouraged her to audition for &quot;Friends&quot;, which was being referred to as &quot;Friends Like These&quot; at the time. Crane and Kauffman had worked with Aniston prior to this. However, casting her as Rachel posed a challenge for the network because, at the time, Aniston was simultaneously starring in a developing CBS sitcom called &quot;Muddling Through&quot;, in which she plays a young woman whose mother is returning home from jail after two years. CBS was initially reluctant to release Aniston from her contract, which required the actress to balance both roles simultaneously, traveling back-and-forth between &quot;Muddling Through&quot; and &quot;Friends&quot; for two weeks. Meanwhile, NBC risked having to recast the role of Rachel, replace Aniston, and reshoot several episodes if CBS&#x27; series proved successful, which would have potentially cost the network millions of dollars. However, Littlefield remained confident that &quot;Muddling Through&quot; would fail. Essentially, the producers of &quot;Friends&quot; hoped that &quot;Muddling Through &quot;would be canceled before &quot;Friends&quot; premiered, while Aniston feared that &quot;Muddling Through &quot;would be the more successful of the two sitcoms in spite of her preference for &quot;Friends&quot;. During this time of uncertainty, Aniston was forced not to participate in several &quot;Friends&quot;-related promotions and photo shoots; the network excluded her from these in case she would be replaced. Aniston explained, &quot;When we were shooting the first grouping of cast photos ... I was asked to step out of a bunch because they didn&#x27;t know if I was going to be still playing Rachel.&quot; Director James Burrows admitted that Aniston had been cast in second position. The producers had already begun auditioning other actresses for the part, while Aniston also received phone calls from her own friends warning her, &quot;I&#x27;m auditioning for your part in &quot;Friends&quot;.&quot; Ultimately, &quot;Muddling Through&quot; was canceled after only three months and 10 episodes, two weeks before the pilot of &quot;Friends&quot; aired, thus allowing Aniston to keep her role on the show, becoming its second youngest cast member at the age of 25. Crane appreciated Aniston&#x27;s interpretation of Rachel because &quot;in the wrong hands Rachel is kind of annoying and spoiled and unlikable,&quot; commending the actress for &quot;breathing life into a difficult character&quot;.

Crane and Kauffman strongly envisioned &quot;Friends&quot; as an ensemble comedy, and Warner Bros. initially marketed the show as such by having the cast appear in their entirety for all press, interviews and photo shoots. One of few sitcoms at the time to be neither a workplace comedy, family sitcom or star a famous comedian, Elizabeth Kolbert of &quot;The New York Times &quot;explained that each of the show&#x27;s main characters are &quot;of equal importance&quot;. As a writer, Crane preferred it this way because &quot;utilizing six equal players, rather than emphasizing one or two, would allow for myriad story lines&quot;. Kauffman echoed that &quot;&quot;Friends&quot; worked best when the entire ensemble was onstage.&quot; The only reason Aniston is credited first during the show&#x27;s title sequence is because the cast is listed alphabetically. The show&#x27;s ensemble format is also believed to have prevented jealous conflicts among the cast. Famously, the &quot;Friends&quot; cast became the first in television history to negotiate as a group for equal salaries, refusing to work until their demands of $100,000 per episode were met during season three, which eventually increased to $1 million per episode by seasons nine and ten – approximately $25 million per year. Alongside Cox and actress Lisa Kudrow, who portrays Phoebe, Aniston became the highest-paid television actress of all time. By then, Aniston had surpassed Cox as the show&#x27;s most famous cast member due to having launched an international hair trend with the &quot;Rachel&quot; and successfully transitioning into a film career, combined with her high-profile relationship with her then-husband, actor Brad Pitt, who had once guest starred in an episode of the show. At times the producers would use the actress&#x27; popularity to boost the show&#x27;s ratings, notably her character&#x27;s seventh season kiss with actress Winona Ryder and pregnancy arc. Aniston had been telling the press that the show&#x27;s ninth season would be her last, and was initially hesitant to return to &quot;Friends&quot; to film its tenth and final season. She explained to NBC&#x27;s Matt Lauer, &quot;I wanted it to end when people still loved us and we were on a high. And then I was also feeling like, &#x27;How much more of Rachel do I have in me?&#x27;&quot; However, the actress ultimately agreed to complete the tenth season of &quot;Friends&quot;, which was reduced from 24 to 18 episodes to accommodate Aniston&#x27;s busy film schedule.

== Characterization and themes ==
Rachel is the youngest of &quot;Friends&quot; six main characters. She was brought up in Long Island, New York. The term &quot;spoiled&quot; is often used to describe the character&#x27;s personality during her early appearances. &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica &quot;describes Rachel as a spoiled and funny character. According to Rachel&#x27;s original character description, written by Crane and Kauffman themselves for the show&#x27;s pilot, the character is a spoiled yet courageous young woman who &quot;has worked for none of what she has&quot;, unlike best friend Monica, and is initially &quot;equipped to do nothing&quot;. James Endrst of the &quot;Hartford Courant &quot;identified her as &quot;a spoiled rich kid&quot;, while the &quot;Daily News&quot; dubbed Rachel an &quot;endearingly spoiled Daddy&#x27;s girl&quot;. Author Kim Etingoff wrote about Rachel in her book &quot;Jennifer Aniston: From Friends to Films &quot; that the character is &quot;spunky and sometimes spoiled&quot;, while TV Land called her &quot;naive&quot;. Citing the differences between Rachel and her two female friends, &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Ryan Gilbey observed that the character &quot;wasn&#x27;t insulated by self-regard, like Monica, or swaddled in gormlessness, like Phoebe&quot;. Frequently identified as fitting the &quot;girl next door&quot; archetype, Anne Bilson of &quot;The Telegraph &quot;described Rachel as &quot;funny but not too funny, pretty but not too pretty, sexy but not too sexy, scatterbrained but not too scatterbrained&quot;. TalkTalk&#x27;s Dominic Wills described the character as &quot;smart but ditzy, determined but undisciplined.&quot; Meanwhile, Liat Kornowski, writing for &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, wrote that Rachel is a &quot;beautiful, coveted, slightly neurotic, borderline egocentric&quot; character.

Observing that the show&#x27;s main characters are each based on a stereotype, Jonathan Bernstein of &quot;The Daily Telegraph &quot;identified Rachel as &quot;the self-absorbed one who goes from riches to rags&quot;. According to &quot;Reign Magazine&quot;, Rachel is &quot;a human being full of vulnerability, humor and strength while aesthetically donning an undeniable beauty and allure&quot;. Originally depicted as a character who is unprepared for &quot;the world as an adult&quot;, Rachel&#x27;s personality was gradually tailored to suit Aniston as the series progressed, becoming &quot;more self-sufficient and sympathetic&quot;. According to &quot;Shining in the&quot; &quot;Shadows: Movie Stars of the 2000s&quot; author Murray Pomerance, &quot;The more boundary collapsed between the &#x27;real&#x27; Jennifer Aniston and Rachel, the more &#x27;authentic&#x27; Aniston became.&quot; Pomerance also noted that the character&#x27;s &quot;well-roundedness, normalcy and relatability&quot; is similar to Aniston&#x27;s, while both the character and the actress herself are very expressive, talking &quot;with [their] hands a good deal.&quot; In her book &quot;How To Write For Television&quot;, author Madeline Dimaggio wrote that although &quot;Rachel grew within the context of the series ... she would always struggle with the spoiled, image-conscious Daddy&#x27;s girl who fled from her wedding in the pilot.&quot; Similarly, BuddyTV wrote that although Rachel &quot;eventually evolves into being less absorbed in later series, she [remains] the most image-centric among the six&quot;, while &quot;Vogue&quot;&#x27;s Edward Barsamian opined, &quot;She might have been self-centered and bratty, but Rachel Green was perhaps the most stylish and unabashedly fashion-obsessed character on the show.&quot; TV Land summarized the character&#x27;s arc and development in the website&#x27;s biography of her, writing, &quot;Rachel is a born shopper, but... she&#x27;s not necessarily a born worker. In fact, before moving in with Monica, she&#x27;s never had to work at all, thanks to the generosity of her parents. Luckily, Rachel is smart, resourceful and chic, so her future is bright, both as a member of the workforce and with her newfound tribe.&quot; Examining the character&#x27;s sexuality, Splitsider&#x27;s Mike D&#x27;Avria determined that Rachel has had the third most sexual partners, 14, as well as the highest percentage of serious monogamous relationships at 71%. D&#x27;Avria opined, &quot;Throughout the whole series Rachel is continually meeting men she wants to impress. Her flirtations typically fail, but she somehow winds up in a serious relationship with them.&quot; Additionally, Rachel is also the only female character to admit to having had a homosexual experience (Chandler having likewise admitted to kissing a man on season 7, episode 4).

In an interview with the&quot; Jewish Telegraph&quot;, Kauffman confirmed that Rachel is Jewish. On the character&#x27;s &quot;Jewish ties&quot;, Kauffman told &quot;J. The Jewish News of Northern California&quot; that Rachel had always been Jewish &quot;in our minds&quot;, explaining, &quot;You can&#x27;t create a character with the name &#x27;Rachel Green&#x27; and not from the get-go make some character choices&quot;. Prior to this, critics and fans had long speculated whether or not Rachel is Jewish. Vulture&#x27;s Lindsey Weber, who identifies herself as Jewish, observed several similarities and Jewish stereotypes she shares with the character, citing the facts that Rachel refers to her grandmother Ida Green as &quot;Bubbe&quot;, Long Island origin, and engagement to a Jewish doctor as allusions to the character&#x27;s Jewish culture. In her book &quot;Changed for Good: A Feminist History of the Broadway Musical&quot;, author Stacy Wolf identified Rachel as one of several popular female television characters who embodied Jewish stereotypes during the 1990s and often served as &quot;the butt of the shows&#x27; jokes&quot;. Meanwhile, JDate&#x27;s Rebecca Frankel cited Rachel as one of the earliest and most prominent examples of the Jewish American Princess stereotype on screen. Writing for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Alicia R. Korenman also acknowledged Rachel&#x27;s initial Jewish American Princess qualities, describing her as &quot;spoiled, dependent on her father&#x27;s money and her fiance&#x27;s, is horrified at the thought of working for a living and generally inept in her attempts to do so, and is eventually revealed to have had a nose job&quot;, which she eventually overcomes as they become less &quot;evident in later seasons of the show&quot;. In his article &quot;Princesses, Schlemiels, Punishers and Overbearing Mothers&quot;, Evan Cooper described Rachel as a &quot;de-semitized&quot; Jew because, aside from her name, &quot;there is never any discussion of experiences of growing up in a Jewish culture, no use of Yiddish, and few, if any, references to family members with distinctively Jewish surnames&quot;. Cooper continued to write that although Rachel possesses some Jewish American Princess traits, she is more similar to the &quot;little woman&quot; stereotype. The &quot;New York Post&quot;″s Robert Rorke labeled Rachel &quot;a rehabilitated Jewish American Princess&quot;, in contrast to her sister Amy (Christina Applegate) who remains &quot;selfish, condescending and narcissistic&quot;.

== Critical reception ==
Critical response towards Rachel remained mostly positive throughout the show&#x27;s ten-season run. Writing for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, John Reid believes that Rachel is responsible for the success of the pilot, explaining, &quot;The story of this group of friends &quot;must&quot; start with a stranger coming to town,&quot; describing Rachel as &quot;the perfect stranger for this plot&quot;. Reid also holds Rachel responsible for spurring character development in the show&#x27;s five other main characters, calling her arrival &quot;a catalyst for all of them to grow, because unlike the rest of them, Rachel is interested in finding meaning for her life&quot;. Also writing for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Sonia Saraiya enjoyed Rachel&#x27;s first awkward encounter with Ross because, for the first time, &quot;Rachel displays a moment of true empathy for another human being&quot;. Saraiya went on to hail Rachel as &quot;a model for women coming of age in the 1990s—the popular, pretty girl dissatisfied with where those illusions have taken her but also unwilling to embrace the more aggressively &#x27;feminist&#x27; career-woman strategy&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; Joseph Hanania enjoyed Rachel&#x27;s telephone conversation with her father during the pilot, describing it as &quot;hilarious&quot;. The&quot; Los Angeles Times&quot; Bob Shayne admitted his attraction towards Rachel, joking, &quot;my feelings for Rachel, I say with some embarrassment, mirror those of Gunther&quot;. &quot;Cosmopolitan &quot;touted Rachel &quot;the best fictional gal pal we&#x27;ve ever had&quot;. While &quot;People &quot;called her &quot;spoiled-but-lovable&quot;, &quot;TV Guide&quot; described Rachel as &quot;neurotic and adorable&quot;. Writing for &quot;Heat&quot;, Ellen Kerry hailed Rachel&#x27;s gradual transformation from waitress to businesswoman as arguably &quot;the best thing on tv&quot;.

&quot;USA Today&quot;&#x27;s Robert Bianco credits Rachel&#x27;s pregnancy storyline with saving &quot;Friends&quot;, observing that the arc increased the show&#x27;s ratings while ultimately &quot;reversing the show&#x27;s decline in ways ... that no one watching &#x27;The One with Monica and Chandler&#x27;s Wedding&#x27; could ever have imagined.&quot; Bianco concluded, &quot;Indeed, without that fortune-altering twist, &quot;Friends&quot; probably would have ended sooner&quot;. BDCwire ranked &quot;The One with the Ball&quot;, &quot;The One with Rachel&#x27;s Inadvertent Kiss&quot;, &quot;The One With The Football&quot;, &quot;The One with the Fake Party&quot; and &quot;The One In Vegas, Part One&quot; Rachel&#x27;s five strongest episodes. Meanwhile, TVLine criticized Rachel for sleeping with ex-fiancé Barry in season one&#x27;s &quot;The One With the Evil Orthodontist&quot;, panning the episode as &quot;cringeworthy&quot;. TVLine similarly criticized the character&#x27;s role in season four&#x27;s &quot;The One With The Fake Party&quot;. At times the character would generate mild controversy, specifically the second-season episode &quot;The One Where Dr. Ramoray Dies&quot;, during which Rachel and Monica argue over who will get to use the last remaining condom in the apartment, which Rachel ultimately wins via a game of rock-paper-scissors. Additionally, fans would often approach Aniston and scold her for decisions that Rachel makes within the show that they do not particularly agree with.

Within the first two seasons of &quot;Friends&quot;, the character became extremely popular among women. Viewers&#x27; perpetual desire to see Rachel succeed helped her remain a fan favorite throughout all ten seasons of the show. Writing for TalkTalk, Dominic Wills agreed that while Rachel established herself as &quot;the general favourite ... No one had a bad word to say about Jennifer Aniston&quot;, with whose performance audiences instantly fell in love. Aniston&#x27;s performance has been consistently praised since her debut in the pilot, about which &quot;Entertainment Weekly&#x27;s &quot;Ken Tucker wrote that the actress portrays Rachel with &quot;prickly intelligence&quot;&quot;.&quot; Writing for &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, David Zurawik cited Aniston among the show&#x27;s &quot;very strong cast&quot;, while &quot;Variety&quot;&#x27;s Tony Scott agreed that &quot;All six of the principals ... appear resourceful and display sharp sitcom skills&quot;; Robert Bianco of the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; praised the work of show&#x27;s female cast equally. &quot;TV Guide&quot; wrote that Aniston &quot;instantly charmed audiences with her perfect looks and endearingly flawed persona&quot;, while Kevin Fallon of &quot;The Daily Beast &quot;referred to Aniston&#x27;s tenure on &quot;Friends&quot; as not &quot;a leading lady performance&quot; but instead &quot;the work of a brilliant character actress&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&#x27;s&quot; Ryan Gilbey highlighted Aniston as the cast member &quot;least reliant on goofball caricature&quot;, observing that &quot;Playing the only character with whom a sane viewer might reasonably identify also meant that she got the lion&#x27;s share of attention&quot;. Writing that the actress &quot;quickly stole our hearts as the daddy&#x27;s girl and aspiring fashionista,&quot; Andrew Collins of &quot;Radio Times &quot;hailed Aniston as a &quot;natural comic performer, as adept with a subtle nose wrinkle as a full-on pratfall, and fluent in quick-fire patter&quot;. In 2002, Aniston won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. In 2003, the actress won the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress In A Television Series – Comedy Or Musical. Dominic Willis of TalkTalk believes that Aniston won these awards because of &quot;her brilliant comic performances in the show&quot;.

=== Relationships ===
Rachel has had several romantic relationships throughout &quot;Friends&quot; decade-long run, the most famous and prominent of which remains her on-again, off-again relationship with friend Ross. Although wildly popular among audiences, the couple has been met with mixed reviews from critics. Katherine Hassel of the &quot;Daily Express&quot; described the characters&#x27; relationship as &quot;the heart of the show&quot;. &quot;China Daily&quot; cited Ross and Rachel&#x27;s reunion during the series finale &quot;The Last One&quot; among the episode&#x27;s highlights, while Gary Susman of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; believes that audiences would not have been happy had the couple not ultimately reunited. Contrastingly, &quot;The Wire&#x27;s&quot; Joe Reid is of the opinion that the show&#x27;s second season is &quot;the only time Ross/Rachel was truly great&quot;. Virgin Media wrote that the couple&#x27;s dynamics &quot;had grown mightily tedious&quot; by season ten. E! cable network ranked Rachel and Ross the ninth greatest &quot;Friends&quot; couple, writing that their relationship gave &quot;&quot;Friends&quot; fans enough iconic quotes to fill a book&quot;, considering Phoebe&#x27;s line &quot;See? [Ross is] her lobster!&quot; to be among show&#x27;s most iconic. Ross and Rachel&#x27;s season three breakup has spawned a debate among &quot;Friends &quot;fans, who continue to argue over which of the two was at fault: Rachel for suggesting that they take a break from their relationship, or Ross for sleeping with another woman immediately afterwards. Writing for &quot;E!&quot;, Jenna Mullins ruled in favor of Rachel, elaborating, &quot;there is no excuse for Ross sleeping with someone else after his lobster suggested taking a break&quot;, concluding that Ross &quot;blew it&quot;. The Jewish community was particularly receptive to the fact that a Jewish-American couple existed on prime time television, described by &quot;Lilith&quot; magazine as &quot;a televisual first&quot;.

Rachel and Ross are considered to be among television&#x27;s greatest and most beloved couples. Ninemsn referred to them as &quot;everyone&#x27;s favourite on ... off ... on (a break!) duo,&quot; while &quot;Us Weekly&quot; and BuzzFeed ranked them the first and second best television couple, respectively. &quot;TV Guide &quot;ranked Ross and Rachel the third greatest television couple, dubbing them &quot;the most iconic TV couple in recent memory&quot;. &quot;Extra&quot; placed the couple at number eight, writing, &quot;Never did we want two people to get together more than Ross ... and Rachel&quot;. Refinery29 included Rachel and Ross in the website&#x27;s &quot;16 TV Couples We Want To Be Together Forever&quot; list. The pair is also often ranked among television&#x27;s greatest &quot;will they or won&#x27;t they&quot; couples. Naming Ross and Rachel the greatest &quot;will they, won&#x27;t they&quot; couple, Network Ten believes they defined the term, while Suggest dubbed them the &quot;quintessential will they/won&#x27;t they couple&quot;. According to Sarah Doran of &quot;Radio Times&quot;, the couple &quot;became synonymous with the phrase &#x27;we&#x27;re on a break&#x27;&quot;. Phoebe&#x27;s line, in which she refers to the couple as each other&#x27;s lobsters, has become one of the show&#x27;s most popular and oft-quoted. Kaitlin Reilly of Bustle magazine defined the term as &quot;the person of whom another is meant to be with forever&quot;. Tara Aquino of &quot;Complex&quot; magazine believes that &quot;Every other person can tell you what exactly a &#x27;Ross and Rachel&#x27; relationship means&quot;. Ultimately, Rachel&#x27;s season eight pregnancy arc is credited with reviving the show&#x27;s ratings and reviews.

During season ten, Rachel&#x27;s brief romance with friend Joey drew strong criticism from both critics and fans, although the contested relationship did not harm viewership. Joshua Kurp of Splitsider believes that the Rachel/Joey/Ross love triangle is the main reason the show&#x27;s final two seasons continued to perform well despite mediocre reviews. Eric Goldman of IGN referred to the Rachel-Joey storyline as &quot;questionable&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Tonight Canada&quot; ranked &quot;The One After Rachel and Joey Kiss&quot; among the show&#x27;s ten worst episodes at number five, with author I. P. Johnson panning it as &quot;desperate&quot;, concluding, &quot;Jeers for even conceiving this romantic plot; cheers for abandoning it&quot;. Contrarily, E! enjoyed Rachel and Joey as a couple because they brought out positive aspects in each other&#x27;s personalities and share a similar sense of humor. Their relationship also spawned a debate among fans, who argued over whether making Rachel and Joey a couple was a bad idea. Jenna Mullins of E! determined that it is because &quot;It was too far into the series to throw these two together. They didn&#x27;t make sense and their romantic scenes felt forced&quot;.

After Ross and Rachel&#x27;s break up, there were many hints that they would eventually reunite forever, especially seasons 8–10. In the final season, Rachel wants to sleep with Ross when her father has a heart attack and wants &quot;sympathy sex&quot;, which he turns down, not wanting to take advantage of her in the state she is in. However, Ross and Rachel do sleep together again the night before she leaves for Paris, which results in him admitting he still loves her and wants to get back together in the series finale. Rachel turns down the Paris job in order to be with Ross when she realizes she still loves him too, and the two agree &quot;this is it&quot;, getting back together for good. Jennifer Aniston, who played Rachel, confirmed that after the series finale, Ross and Rachel got remarried, happily and had at least one more child.

== Impact and legacy ==
Rachel&#x27;s popularity would establish her as the show&#x27;s breakout character; she is often ranked among the greatest characters in television history. &quot;Us Weekly&quot; ranked Rachel the most beloved television character of the past two decades, citing her as &quot;one of TV&#x27;s most endearing personalities&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly &quot;ranked the character sixth on a similar countdown, while AOL TV included Rachel among television&#x27;s hundred &quot;Greatest Women&quot; at number 23, with author Kim Potts observing that &quot;Rachel became one of viewers&#x27; favorite &quot;Friends&quot; because she grew from what could have been a one-note character ... into a more independent, caring pal&quot;. BuddyTV ranked Rachel the 15th funniest female character in sitcom history, while ChaCha collectively ranked Rachel, Monica and Phoebe 11th, 12th and 13th on the website&#x27;s list of the &quot;Top 16 Female TV Characters of All Time&quot;. According to &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, Hollywood professionals voted Rachel the 29th best female character in 2016. In 2019, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; ranked Rachel the third most influential &quot;female character who changed our TV screens&quot;. Author Olivia Blair wrote that Rachel &quot;promote ideals of female independence, unashamedly discuss sex and female pleasure, educate the men in their lives on how to treat women throughout the ten seasons.&quot; Writing for Entertainmentwise, Georgina Littlejohn believes Rachel inspired the character Penny in the sitcom &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, noting that the characters, both waitresses, are &quot;blonde, cute, funny, likeable girls-next-door&quot;. Several baby name books and websites commonly associate the name &quot;Rachel&quot; with the character.

Both Rachel and Aniston became fashion icons due to their combined influence on womenswear during the 1990s, particularly among British women. &quot;Vogue&quot;&#x27;s Edward Barsamian credits Rachel with inspiring &quot;the cool New York look&quot;. According to &quot;Stylist&quot;, Rachel &quot;revived [a] love of denim shirts and dungarees&quot;, while Mahogany Clayton of StyleBlazer believes that the character &quot;managed to dominate every fashion trend that passed by her radar in the most stylish ways possible&quot;. Hailing her as the &quot;Fash Queen&quot;, &quot;Heat&quot; magazine observed the character&#x27;s influence on plaid skirts, denim and overalls. Citing every costume the character wore during the first season of &quot;Friends&quot;, BuzzFeed determined that Rachel popularized the mullet dress. &quot;TV Guide&quot; published a list of &quot;The 17 Ways Rachel from Friends Changed &#x27;90s Fashion&quot;. Rachel is often considered to be one of television&#x27;s best dressed characters. &quot;Elle &quot;included Rachel in the magazine&#x27;s &quot;50 Best Dressed Women on TV&quot; list. PopSugar ranked &quot;Friends&quot; 15th on the website&#x27;s list of &quot;50 TV Shows That Changed the Way We Dress&quot;, citing Rachel&#x27;s &quot;impressive&quot; wardrobe. &quot;InStyle&quot; ranked &quot;Friends&quot; the 36th most fashionable television show of all time, praising Rachel, Monica and Phoebe&#x27;s costumes. &quot;StyleCaster&quot; ranked Rachel among &quot;The 50 Most Stylish TV Characters Of All Time&quot; at number 28. &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine compiled a list of &quot;16 things Rachel Green wore to work that we&#x27;d totally wear today&quot;, while Virgin Media ranked the character among television&#x27;s sexiest. &quot;Brides&quot; magazine ranked Rachel&#x27;s wedding dress among &quot;The Best TV Wedding Dresses&quot;, with contributor Jane Frankfort commending the dress with &quot;set[ting] the tone for the following 10 years together and the many milestones our favorite friends will bring&quot;.

Like her character, Aniston became the show&#x27;s breakout star. Karen Thomas of &quot;USA Today&quot; dubbed Aniston &quot;our favorite Friend&quot;. According to Turner Classic Movies, Aniston ultimately became &quot;One of the most popular television actresses of her era&quot;. According to &quot;Jennifer Aniston: From Friends to Films&quot; author Kim Etingoff, the actress&#x27; own fame &quot;outshone&quot; those of her co-stars, becoming the first cast member to &quot;rise to prominence&quot;; the actress continues to experience the most post-&quot;Friends &quot;success. Aniston&#x27;s performance in &quot;Friends&quot; led to a successful film career. According to &quot;The Inquisitr News&quot;, Rachel is &quot;the role that would end up launching [Aniston&#x27;s] success&quot;, while Bradford Evans of Splitsider believes &quot;that Jennifer Aniston likely wouldn&#x27;t have become a major movie star without &quot;Friends&quot;&quot;. While ranking Aniston the most attractive sitcom star of the 1990s, Josh Robertson of &quot;Complex&quot; magazine wrote that &quot;With the haircut, the TV fame, and a true gift for comedy ... combined, Aniston became a big star&quot;, replacing Cox as the show&#x27;s &quot;established hottie&quot;. According to Steve Charnock of Yahoo! Movies, Aniston is &quot;the series&#x27; only main cast member to become a bona fide movie star since the end of the show&quot;. While agreeing that Aniston&#x27;s film career has been successful, several critics believe that the actress&#x27; filmography remains limited to playing Rachel-like roles in romantic comedies, save for some exceptions. Ryan Gilbey of &quot;The Guardian &quot;noted that &quot;Consequently, many of Aniston&#x27;s movie roles ... have been Rachel in all but name.&quot; Andrew Collins of &quot;Radio Times &quot;agreed, writing that Aniston &quot;seems trapped, perpetually playing variations of Rachel&quot;. According to &quot;TV Guide&quot;, Aniston is &quot;usually called upon to play a variation of her neurotic and adorable &quot;Friends&quot; character&quot;. Aniston cites Rachel as one of three roles for which she is most grateful, to whom she &quot;owe[s] everything&quot;. On being typecast in the aftermath of Rachel, Aniston admits that at times it &quot;gives you more of a challenge, to shape people&#x27;s perceptions of you&quot;. as audiences struggle &quot;to lose the Rachel tag that has made her one of the world&#x27;s most recognisable faces&quot;.

=== Hair ===

Named after the character, the &quot;Rachel&quot; refers to a bouncy layered shag inspired by the way in which Aniston wore her hair on &quot;Friends&quot; between 1994 and 1996, during the first and second seasons of the series. The &quot;Rachel&quot; debuted in the show&#x27;s 20th episode, &quot;The One with the Evil Orthodontist&quot;. Aniston believes that her hair stylist, Chris McMillan, created the haircut while he was under the influence of marijuana. The &quot;Rachel&quot; immediately became popular among women, launching an international hair trend. The popularity of the &quot;Rachel&quot; coincided with the popularity of &quot;Friends&quot; during the mid-to-late-1990s. &quot;Marie Claire&quot; estimates that 11 million women donned the hairstyle throughout the decade, while the &quot;Daily Express&quot; determined that the hairstyle was most popular among British women, who went to hair salons &quot;clutching magazine pictures of Aniston&quot; and asking hairdressers to give them the look.

According to &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, the hairstyle&#x27;s &quot;widespread popularity ... in the show&#x27;s very first year cemented the sitcom early on as heavily influential when it came to style&quot;. The &quot;Rachel&quot; remains one of the most popular hairstyles in history, and became the most popular hairstyle in the United States since actress Farrah Fawcett&#x27;s. Hair stylists credit its appeal and popularity to its medium length and volume, combined with its tendency to frame the face flatteringly. Hairdresser Mark Woolley described it as &quot;a cut that flatters almost everyone, designed to make women look beautiful&quot;. The &quot;Rachel&quot; is often ranked among the greatest and most iconic hairstyles of all time, with &quot;Redbook&quot; placing it at number four and &quot;Time&quot; ranking it ninth. &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; determined that the hairstyle is one of &quot;The Most Famous TV Hairstyles Of All Time&quot;. &quot;US Weekly&quot; ranked the &quot;Rachel&quot; the 17th most iconic hairstyle. &quot;Glamour&quot; magazine ranked the &quot;Rachel&quot; fourth on the magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The 100 Best Hairstyles of All Time&quot;. The magazine also cited it among &quot;The very best hair to have graced the small screen&quot;, while ranking it the most memorable hairstyle in television history. &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald &quot;ranked it the second greatest television hairstyle, while &quot;Metro &quot;ranked the &quot;Rachel&quot; the character&#x27;s second-best hairstyle. Ranked sixth on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s list of the &quot;25 Fashion Moments That Changed Entertainment&quot;, the haircut was declared the most &quot;desired&quot; hairstyle of the Clinton era.

Zahra Barnes of &quot;Self&quot; joked that Rachel&#x27;s hair has always been the &quot;true star of the show&quot;. Lauding the &quot;Rachel&quot; as one of television&#x27;s greatest hairstyles, Sarah Carrillo of &quot;Elle&quot; magazine believed that its popularity &quot;helped make &quot;Friends&quot; the phenomenon it was&quot;. Opining that &quot;Friends&quot; spawned few memorable catchphrases in comparison to its contemporaries, Tom Jicha of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; attributes much of the show&#x27;s legacy to the hairstyle, calling it the show&#x27;s &quot;only cultural trend&quot;. Josh Robertson of &quot;Complex&quot; magazine felt that &quot;With the haircut, the TV fame, and a true gift for comedy ... combined, Aniston became a big star&quot;, replacing Courteney Cox. Hannah Lyons Powell of &quot;Glamour&quot; agreed that the hairstyle made Aniston &quot;the definitive hair icon of the &#x27;90s and the proud owner of arguably the most infamous and influential hairstyle of all time&quot;. According to Jim Vorel of &quot;Paste&quot; magazine, &quot;&#x27;the Rachel&#x27; hairstyle became the decade&#x27;s defining &#x27;do, calling it &quot;the definition of influence&quot;. However, Rebecca Cox of &quot;Glamour&quot; is grateful that the hairstyle remained in the 1990s.

In the second-season episode &quot;The One with the Lesbian Wedding&quot;, Rachel references the popularity of her haircut when she complains that her own overbearing mother is trying to reinvent her life after hers, lamenting, &quot;Couldn&#x27;t she just copy my haircut?&quot; Despite her association with the cut, Aniston disliked the hairstyle. She found maintaining the hairstyle without McMillan&#x27;s help difficult, stating &quot;I&#x27;d curse Chris every time I had to blowdry. It took three brushes—it was like doing surgery!&quot; and that she would rather shave her head than have to wear it for the rest of her life. Since Aniston, several other celebrities have worn variations of the &quot;Rachel&quot;, among them actresses Cameron Diaz, Rachel McAdams, Emma Watson, Reese Witherspoon, Julia Roberts, comedian Tina Fey, model Tyra Banks, and singer Lily Allen.

<text>Gérard Paul Francis Houllier (; 3 September 194714 December 2020) was a French professional football manager and player. Clubs he managed include Paris Saint-Germain, Lens and Liverpool, where he won the FA Cup, League Cup, FA Charity Shield, UEFA Cup and UEFA Super Cup in 2001. He then guided Lyon to two French titles, before announcing his resignation on 25 May 2007. He became manager of Aston Villa in September 2010. He also coached the France national team between 1992 and 1993. He assisted Aimé Jacquet in the 1998 FIFA World Cup, was part of UEFA&#x27;s and FIFA&#x27;s Technical Committee in the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cup finals, and technical director for the French Football Federation during the 2010 finals. In June 2011, he stepped down from club coaching, leaving his managerial role at Aston Villa, following frequent hospitalisation over heart problems.

From July 2012 until his death, Houllier had been head of global football for Red Bull. He was responsible for Austrian side Red Bull Salzburg, Germany&#x27;s RB Leipzig and American club New York Red Bulls, Red Bull Brasil, as well as the now dissolved Red Bull Ghana academies. He became the technical director of women&#x27;s football clubs Lyon Féminin and OL Reign in November 2020.

==Early life==
Born in Thérouanne, Houllier entered Lille University to pursue a degree in English, but in the first year his father&#x27;s serious illness forced him to drop out of full-time study and start work, eventually as a school teacher, while he completed his degree part-time. As part of his degree, he elected to spend a year in 1969–1970 in the city of Liverpool as an assistant at Alsop Comprehensive School, and while there he attended his first Liverpool F.C. match on 16 September 1969, a 10–0 thrashing of Irish club Dundalk. He also played for an amateur local side, Alsop. He was an enthusiastic footballer, but never threatened the professional ranks as a player. He was deputy headmaster of the École Normale d&#x27;Arras until reaching age 26 in 1973, when he began his full-time managerial career as player-manager of Le Touquet.

==Managerial career==
===Early career and France national team===
Between 1976 and 1982, Houllier was head coach of French amateur club Nœux-les-Mines. Despite limited resources, the team achieved promotion during his tenure, rising to the Division 2. He then moved to Lens in 1982, coaching them to promotion to the top division and qualification for the UEFA Cup, before moving to Paris Saint-Germain in 1985, where PSG won the French title the following year. In 1988, Houllier was appointed technical director and assistant to the France national team, under manager Michel Platini. Houllier became manager in 1992, but resigned in November 1993 after France failed to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup finals.

In the 2011 book &quot;Secrets de coachs&quot;, Houllier singled out winger David Ginola for blame in a crucial defeat to Bulgaria during the qualification campaign. Ginola filed a lawsuit against Houllier for defamation, but this was dismissed by a French court in 2012. Houllier remained as technical director for the national team until 1998, a role which included the coaching of France&#x27;s junior sides. In 1996, Houllier&#x27;s under-18 side won the European Under-18 Championship, and several members of his youth teams, such as David Trezeguet and Thierry Henry went on to form part of France&#x27;s victorious team in the 1998 FIFA World Cup.

===Liverpool===
In July 1998, Houllier was invited to become joint team manager of Liverpool, together with Roy Evans. The arrangement did not work out and Evans resigned in November after losing to Tottenham Hotspur 3–1 at home in the League Cup on 10 November 1998. Prior to the defeat, Liverpool were eliminated from the UEFA Cup by Spanish side Celta de Vigo. The departure of Evans left Houllier in sole charge of the team. 
Houllier began what he described as a five-year programme to rebuild the team, and restore discipline to a squad that had been labelled widely as &quot;Spice Boys&quot;, as well as begin a continental approach, both tactically and in terms of personnel, to the game starting in 1999. That summer, Paul Ince, David James, Jason McAteer, Rob Jones, Tony Warner and Steve Harkness were all sold, while Steve McManaman left on a free transfer. Simultaneously, eight new players were signed: Sami Hyypiä, Dietmar Hamann, Stéphane Henchoz, Vladimír Šmicer, Sander Westerveld, Titi Camara, Eric Meijer and Djimi Traoré. The club&#x27;s youth players such as Jamie Carragher, Michael Owen and Steven Gerrard also became a cornerstone of the team. Liverpool&#x27;s training facilities at Melwood were thoroughly overhauled.
The rebuilding continued in 2000 with the signings of Markus Babbel, Nicky Barmby, Pegguy Arphexad, Grégory Vignal, Emile Heskey, Gary McAllister, Igor Bišćan and Christian Ziege, as well as the departures of David Thompson, Phil Babb, Dominic Matteo, Steve Staunton, Brad Friedel and Stig Inge Bjørnebye. The efforts yielded a result in the successful 2000–01 season, when Liverpool won a cup treble of the League Cup, the FA Cup and the UEFA Cup and finished third in the Premier League, hence qualifying for Champions League. In August 2001, Liverpool won the Charity Shield against Manchester United and UEFA Super Cup against Bayern Munich.

In October 2001, after falling ill at half-time at Liverpool&#x27;s Premier League match with Leeds United, Houllier was rushed to hospital for an emergency operation due to the discovery of a heart condition, an aortic dissection. With the help of caretaker manager Phil Thompson, he guided Liverpool to a second-place finish in the 2001–02 FA Premier League season, at the time their best record in the Premiership. Houllier returned to active management of the club after five months, although significantly weakened by the heart condition.

In the 2002—03 season, Liverpool finished in the fifth place in the Premier League, failing to qualify for the following season&#x27;s UEFA Champions League after a final-day defeat to Chelsea. Critics blamed Houllier&#x27;s unsuccessful summer signings in 2002, namely El Hadji Diouf (Lens, £10 million), Salif Diao (Sedan, £5 million) and Bruno Cheyrou (Lille, £4 million), and his failure to make Nicolas Anelka&#x27;s loan move permanent in favour of signing the ineffective Diouf. Houllier&#x27;s failure to replace creative talents such as Gary McAllister and Jari Litmanen was also criticised. In March 2003, Liverpool defeated Manchester United 2–0 in the League Cup Final. In October 2003, Houllier appointed Steven Gerrard club captain. With Liverpool failing to mount a title challenge in his last two seasons despite substantial investment in players with what was perceived as negative one-dimensional tactics and unattractive football, a poor youth policy, his constant mention of &quot;turning corners&quot; and a lack of support from fans, these factors led to Houllier&#x27;s departure from Liverpool on 24 May 2004. Having qualified the club for the following season&#x27;s Champions League, Houllier left Liverpool by mutual consent, after reluctantly agreeing to a board request that he leave the club. He was replaced by Valencia coach Rafael Benítez.

===Lyon===
On 29 May 2005, it was announced that Houllier had signed a two-year contract as manager of the champions of Ligue 1, succeeding Paul Le Guen. Lyon had just won their previous fourth successive championship and Houllier was hired to convert this domestic dominance to the European stage. Despite continuing this dominance of Ligue 1, Lyon lost to Milan in the quarter-finals of the 2005–06 Champions League while they crashed out to the inexperienced Roma in the first knockout round of the 2006–07 Champions League. Houllier also suffered a cup final defeat (Coupe de la Ligue) to Bordeaux. However, in April 2007, Houllier won his second-straight (Lyon&#x27;s sixth-straight) Ligue 1 title after Toulouse&#x27;s loss to Rennes. The 2006–07 season proved to be his last with the club: on 25 May 2007, he stepped down due to a fractious relationship with outspoken chairman Jean-Michel Aulas, who was frustrated at the club&#x27;s inability to convert domestic dominance into European success. An official statement on Lyon&#x27;s website stated that Houllier asked to be released from the last season of his contract and that request was granted by the president. Houllier also said that he needed a break after experiencing two seasons with Lyon.

===Return to the France national team===
Houllier was reappointed to the role of technical director for the France national team in September 2007, replacing interim-incumbent Jean-Pierre Morlans. Despite the team&#x27;s poor performance during UEFA Euro 2008, Houllier advised French Football Federation president Jean-Pierre Escalettes to keep faith with manager Raymond Domenech. This decision attracted criticism as France went on to be eliminated in the first round of the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Escalettes resigned from his post after the tournament, but Houllier chose not to step down. In an interview with Stéphane Mandard of &quot;Le Monde&quot;, he denied responsibility for the failed campaign, stating that his responsibilities did not extend to the first team and that he was not Domenech&#x27;s line manager.

===Aston Villa===
On 8 September 2010, it was announced that English Premier League club Aston Villa had appointed Houllier as their new full-time manager, following the resignation of previous boss Martin O&#x27;Neill the month before. In his first press conference at the club, it was revealed Houllier had not yet signed a contract and would not take charge of the club until a later date due to commitments with the French Football Federation.

Houllier&#x27;s first match in charge was the League Cup match against Blackburn Rovers on 22 September. Villa won the match 3–1, coming back from a goal down to progress to the next round of the competition. It was announced on 18 September 2010 that Gary McAllister had agreed to become his assistant manager, with Gordon Cowans also taking a role in Houllier&#x27;s backroom staff. Two days after the Blackburn match, he signed a three-year contract. However, Houllier&#x27;s start at the club proved to be difficult. The side was hit with injuries to key players Gabriel Agbonlahor, Stiliyan Petrov, Nigel Reo-Coker and Emile Heskey, and managed just one win in ten Premier League matches. In November 2010, Houllier signed 37-year-old former Arsenal midfielder Robert Pires on a free transfer in an attempt to aid the club during its injury crisis. By January 2011, Villa had picked up just 21 points from 20 Premier League matches. The club had also been knocked out of the League Cup the previous month by local rivals Birmingham City. On 5 January, Villa were beaten 1–0 at home by Sunderland; this loss left Villa in 18th position in the league table, the first time they had been in the relegation zone since 2003. During the match, a selection of the home crowd targeted Houllier with chants of &quot;you&#x27;re getting sacked in the morning&quot; to vent their frustration at the club&#x27;s poor run of form. Despite this, Villa directors acted quickly to insist that Houllier&#x27;s job as manager was safe.

In the January transfer Window, Houllier signed Kyle Walker on loan from Tottenham Hotspur in a bid to improve Villa&#x27;s struggling defence. This signing was followed by the arrival of Jean Makoun from Houllier&#x27;s former club Lyon, before Sunderland&#x27;s Darren Bent was brought to Villa Park in a deal that broke the club&#x27;s transfer record. Villa&#x27;s January transfer window was rounded off with the loan signing of American international midfielder Michael Bradley from Borussia Mönchengladbach. In February 2011, Houllier criticised the commitment of Villa defenders Habib Beye and Stephen Warnock. The pair were forced to train with the club&#x27;s reserve side and were not selected by the Frenchman, even when the club faced even more injury concerns. After the defeat to Sunderland, Villa underwent a revival, winning five and drawing three of their next nine matches in the league and FA Cup, including defeating Manchester City 1–0 in a run which saw the team climb to 12th.

However, Villa were eliminated from the FA Cup by Manchester City via a 3–0 away loss in early March 2011. Houllier chose to rest a number of key first-team players, a move that was criticised by fans and the media alike. The club&#x27;s league form also failed to improve. During a team-bonding exercise at a health spa in Leicestershire, Villa defenders James Collins and Richard Dunne were involved in a confrontation with club staff. The players were each fined two weeks&#x27; wages. However, Houllier said the incident did not affect team morale. On 19 March, Villa faced local rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Premier League at Villa Park. Prior to the match, a banner reading, &quot;Had enough, Houllier out&quot; was unveiled by some supporters in the stadium&#x27;s Holte End stand. However, this was quickly removed by the club&#x27;s stewarding staff. The away side won 1–0 thanks to a goal from Matt Jarvis, claiming their first win against Aston Villa in 31 years. Towards the end of the match, the home fans once again verbally attacked Houllier with chants of &quot;we want Houllier out&quot; and &quot;you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing&quot;, before giving a chorus of boos at the final whistle.

On 20 April 2011, Houllier was admitted to hospital after falling ill during the night. His condition was said to be stable, but he was not able to be at Aston Villa&#x27;s training session the following day, and was not able to attend their match against Stoke City on 23 April, or any subsequent matches of the 2010–11 season. Gary McAllister took charge of all first team affairs in his stead. On 1 June 2011, Houllier stepped down as manager of Aston Villa by mutual consent. In Houllier&#x27;s only season, Villa finished ninth.

==Death==
Houllier died on 14 December 2020, aged 73, in Paris, after a heart operation. Former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard paid tribute to Houllier, saying, &quot;He was more than just a manager&quot; and that he shaped him into &quot;a better player, a better person, a better leader&quot;.

<doc id="335824" wikidata="Q729128" url="?curid=335824" title="Boule (ancient Greece)">
<text>In cities of ancient Greece, the boule (; : boulai, ) was a council (, &quot;bouleutai&quot;) appointed to run daily affairs of the city. Originally a council of nobles advising a king, &quot;boulai&quot; evolved according to the constitution of the city: In oligarchies &quot;boule&quot; positions might have been hereditary, while in democracies members were typically chosen by lot and served for one year. Little is known about the workings of many &quot;boulai&quot;, except in the case of Athens, for which extensive material has survived.

==Athenian &quot;boule&quot;==
The original council of Athens was the Areopagus. It consisted of ex-archons and was aristocratic in character.

===Solonian &quot;boule&quot;===
The Athenian &quot;boule&quot; under Solon heard appeals from the most important decisions of the courts. Those in the poorest class could not serve on the &quot;boule&quot; of 400. The higher governmental posts, archons (magistrates), were reserved for citizens of the top two income groups.

=== Cleisthenes&#x27; &quot;boule&quot; (after 508 BC) ===
Following the Athenian Revolution in 508 BC Cleisthenes formed a new government of Athens through a series of reforms. In strengthening the common Athenian identity Cleisthenes devised an artificial political division of Athens into ten tribes. The tribes would each include local &quot;demes&quot; from three different types of areas; the city trittys, the coastal trittys and inland trittys. The institution of the &quot;boule&quot; was reformed accordingly and would now be a council of 500 male citizens. Each of the ten tribes supplied 50 men to the council with each of the 50 adhering from its constituting demes and distributed according to the size of their population. Under Cleisthenes, the &quot;boule&quot; attained renewed political power as responsible for the agenda-setting of the legislative body of the Assembly (&quot;ekklesia&quot;) as well as the formal execution of the political decisions taken in the Assembly. The council was responsible for about half of the decrees ratified by the Assembly. The &quot;boule&quot; met every day except for festival days and ill-omened days. According to Aristotle, Cleisthenes introduced the bouleutic oath.

==== Selection process ====
Members of the Council under Cleisthenes were selected by lot. Not all citizens, however, were in the selection pool when selecting members by lot from each deme. Only male citizens age 30 or above and with no criminal charges, who had put themselves forward would be available for selection. Membership was restricted at this time to the top three of the original four property classes (the &quot;pentacosiomedimni&quot;, &quot;hippeis&quot; and &quot;zeugitae&quot;, but not the &quot;thetes&quot;) and to citizens over the age of thirty. The former restriction, though never officially changed, fell out of practice by the middle of the 5th century BC.

==== Accountability and responsiveness ====
The &quot;boule&quot; had a number of safeguarding principles that secured the accountability and responsiveness of the council to the larger public. Three of the main mechanisms in place were; monitoring by other governing institutions including the assembly (ekklesia) and the courts, the required rendering of a full account of the work undertaken upon leaving the council and not least the ability of the general citizenry and fellow council members to charge individual members with a vote of no confidence.

Members served for one year and no man could serve more than twice in his life, nor more than once a decade. The leadership of the &quot;boule&quot; (the &quot;prytany&quot;) rotated between the tribe delegations and a new &quot;prytany&quot; was chosen every month by lot. The man in charge of &quot;prytany&quot; was replaced every day from among the 50 members again chosen by lot.

===Ephialtes&#x27; &quot;boule&quot; (after 461 BC)===
After the reforms of Ephialtes and Pericles in the mid-5th century BC, the &quot;boule&quot; took on many of the administrative and judicial functions of the Areopagus, which retained its traditional right to try homicide cases. It supervised the state&#x27;s finances, navy, cavalry, sacred matters, building and shipping matters and care for invalids and orphans. Its own members staffed many boards that oversaw the finer points of these many administrative duties. It undertook the examination of public officials both before and after leaving office (most offices lasting one year) to ensure honest accounting and loyalty to the state. It heard some cases of impeachment of public officials for high crimes and mismanagement or serious dereliction of duties. At some point in the late 5th century, pay was instituted for those serving in the &quot;boule&quot;; this may have been a way to encourage poorer citizens to volunteer, who would otherwise be reluctant to serve. The &quot;boule&quot; was considered the cornerstone of the democratic constitution, providing a locus for day-to-day activities and holding together the many disparate administrative functions of the government. Because of the rotation of members, it was assumed that the &quot;boule&quot; was free from the domination of factions of any kind, although there is some evidence that richer citizens served out of proportion to poorer citizens. This may be due to the heavy investment of time required, time that poorer citizens would not have had to spare.

==&quot;Boulai&quot; in other Greek states==

===Kingdom of Macedonia===
In the Macedonian Kingdom, and later the Macedonian Empire, the body that assisted the king with running the kingdom was called the &quot;synedrion&quot;, literally translated as &quot;The Congress&quot;. This tradition continued to be in use in the years of Alexander the Great and its members were hereditary. Although not democratic, the members of the Synedrion, including the king, were considered equal to one another and had the right of the freedom of speech.

===Corinth===
The League of Corinth was a federation of Greek states created by king Philip II of Macedon during the winter of 338/337 BC to facilitate his use of unified Greek military forces in his war against Achaemenid Persia. The league guaranteed, among other things, that member states&#x27; constitutions in force at the time of joining were guaranteed and that a Synedrion, or congress of representatives, was to meet at Corinth.

===Epirus===
The Epirus, which became a federal republic in 231 BC, was ruled by the &quot;Synedrion&quot;, or &quot;The Congress&quot;. The Synedrion was dissolved when the Epirote federation fell apart due to internal upheaval during the Third Macedonian War.

== Modern Greece ==

The name &quot;boule&quot;, pronounced as &quot;Vouli&quot; in Modern Greek, is preserved in the Parliament of modern Greece; either as the name of the lower house of a bicameral parliament in 1844–1864 and 1927–1935, or the name of the unicameral Parliament in 1864–1927, 1935–1941, 1944–1967, and 1974–today.

<text>The Metropolitan Archdiocese of Philadelphia () is a Latin Church ecclesiastical territory, or diocese, of the Catholic Church in southeastern Pennsylvania in the United States.

The Archdiocese of Philadelphia originally included all of Pennsylvania and Delaware, along with seven counties and parts of three counties in New Jersey. The diocese was raised to an archdiocese in 1875.

In 2012, diocese priest William Lynn became the first Catholic official to be convicted in the United States of covering up abuses by other priests in his charge. In 2020, the ongoing sexual abuse scandal in the archdiocese was expected to result in payment of $126 million to victims.

The seat of the archbishop is the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul in Philadelphia. As of 2024, Nelson J. Pérez is the archbishop of Philadelphia.

== Territory ==
The Archdiocese of Philadelphia covers five Pennsylvania counties: Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery, and Philadelphia. It is the metropolitan see of the Ecclesiastical Province of Philadelphia.

The archdiocese includes the following suffragan dioceses:

* Allentown
* Altoona-Johnstown
* Erie 
* Greensburg
* Harrisburg 
* Pittsburgh 
* Scranton

==History==

The history of the Catholic Church in the area dates back to William Penn when Mass was said publicly as early as 1707.

===19th century===
In 1808, Pope Pius VII erected the suffragan dioceses of Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, and Bardstown, Kentucky, from the territory of the Diocese of Baltimore. The pope appointed Reverend Michael Francis Egan as the first bishop of Philadelphia.

In 1868, the Vatican erected the dioceses of Harrisburg, Scranton, and Wilmington, taking their territory from the Diocese of Philadelphia.

The Vatican elevated the Diocese of Philadelphia to the Archdiocese of Philadelphia on February 12, 1875.

===20th century===
In 1961, Pope John XXIII erected the Diocese of Allentown, taking several northern counties from the Archdiocese of Philadelphia.

By 1969, the archdiocese had grown to 1,351,704 parishioners, 1,096 diocesan priests, 676 priests of religious institutes and 6,622 religious women.

===21st century===
In February 2012, the diocese announced the largest reorganization of their elementary and high school education system, with numerous recommended school closings or mergers.

In August 2012, the archdiocese announced that the Faith in the Future Foundation would assume management of the 17 archdiocesan high schools and the four special education schools.

==Churches==
==Educational institutions==
Circa 1912 there were about 68,000 students in Catholic schools within the archdiocesan territory. This increased to 250,000 in 1961, but the figures decreased after that year. Enrollment was down to 68,000 in 2012. There were about 50,000 students in Catholic schools in the city of Philadelphia in 2000, and this figure decreased to 30,000 in 2010. In that span one Catholic high school and 23 Catholic elementary schools closed or merged, and the proliferation of charter schools in that period meant that the number of students combined in that type of school outnumbered that of the remaining Philadelphia Catholic schools.

In 2012 the archdiocese proposed closing or merging 18 schools in Philadelphia and 31 schools outside of Philadelphia; the &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; stated this would further weaken Philadelphia&#x27;s middle class. The proposal would affect 24% and 29% of the senior high and K-8 schools, respectively.

===Elementary schools===
The first Catholic school established in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia was at St. Mary Parish in Philadelphia during the late eighteenth century. During the nineteenth century, Bishop Kenrick encouraged the establishment of Catholic schools. Subsequently, John Neumann (1851–1860) made the establishment of parish elementary schools a priority and by 1860 there were seventeen parish elementary schools in Philadelphia. Between 1900 and 1930, Catholic elementary schools increased to 124 schools in Philadelphia and 78 schools in the four suburban counties. Between 1945 and 1965, 62 new Catholic elementary schools were established.

In 2012, about 25% of the students in Philadelphia Catholic elementary schools were not Catholic. In 2010 South Philadelphia Catholic elementary schools had 2,572 students, a decline by 27% from the 2006 figure.

===Special needs schools===
With the foundation of Archbishop Ryan School for Children with Deafness in 1912, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia school system began serving families of children with special needs. St. Katherine Day School and Our Lady of Confidence School, serving students with mental retardation, were opened in 1953 and 1954, respectively, after parent petitions to John Cardinal O&#x27;Hara. St. Lucy Day School for Children with Visual Impairment followed in 1955. Queen of the Universe Day Center was added in 1980 to serve students with mental retardation in Bucks County. These five schools are supported by the Catholic Charities Appeal.

===High schools within the archdiocese===
====Diocesan high schools====
Leadership within the Archdiocese of Philadelphia envisioned a continued comprehensive education for secondary students.

The first free Catholic high school in the United States was the &quot;Roman Catholic High School of Philadelphia&quot;, founded for the education of boys in 1890. (It is often referred to as &quot;Roman Catholic&quot;, occasionally as &quot;Catholic High&quot;, and most commonly as &quot;Roman&quot;.) The &quot;Catholic Girls High School&quot; was founded in 1912. Mary McMichan, one of the school&#x27;s founders, requested in her last will that the school be renamed in honor of her brother. The school became &quot;John W. Hallahan Catholic Girls High School&quot; after her death. Both schools are still in existence.

Between 1916 and 1927 West Catholic Boys and Girls and Northeast Catholic were opened. Despite the economic hardships of the 1930s and 1940s, seven more diocesan high schools were founded. Between 1945 and 1967, fifteen high schools were opened.

As of 2023, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia has 15 diocesan high schools.

===Seminaries===
*St. Charles Borromeo Seminary
*Redemptois Mater Archdiocesan Missionary Seminary

===Colleges and universities within the archdiocese===

== Catholic Social Services ==
The archdiocese has had a foster care agency for more than 100 years. It sued Philadelphia after the city stopped referring foster care cases to the agency after it refused to use same-sex couples to foster children. The case went to the Supreme Court with the name &quot;Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, Pa.&quot;

==Controversies==
===Sexual abuse scandals===

The Philadelphia abuses were substantially revealed through a grand jury investigation in 2005. Cardinal Justin Francis Rigali adopted the policy of laicizing those who were accused and confirmed by investigations. A second grand jury in 2011 said that as many as 37 priests were credibly accused of sexual abuse or inappropriate behavior toward minors. In 2012, a guilty plea by priest Edward Avery and the related trial and conviction of William Lynn and mistrial on charges against James J. Brennan followed from the grand jury&#x27;s investigations. In 2013, Charles Engelhardt and teacher Bernard Shero were tried, convicted and sentenced to prison. Lynn was the first official to be convicted in the United States of covering up abuses by other priests in his charge and other senior church officials have been extensively criticized for their management of the issue in the archdiocese.

On March 12, 2020, a new trial date was set for Lynn, who was released in 2016 and ordered to be retried after serving 33 months of his sentence. Jury selection was to start on March 16, 2020. However, the ongoing coronavirus pandemic forced Lynn&#x27;s retrial to be delayed until January 2021. Following his release from prison in 2016, Lynn was ordered to remain on supervised parole until his retrial. In 2019, it was reported that the 2011 grand jury report also resulted in Lynn being suspended from ministry. IN 2023 he was sentenced to 37 months in prison.

On May 5, 2020, Archdiocese of Philadelphia announced that it now expected to pay $126 million in reparations. The archdiocese also said its Independent Reconciliation and Reparations Program, which was established in 2018, has received a total of 615 claims, and had settled 208 of them for $43.8 million as of April 22, 2020. That averages out to about $211,000 per claim, which is in line with what other dioceses have been paying under similar programs. The same day, however, the total amount of money which the Archdiocese of Philadelphia expected to pay in sex abuse settlements was revised to $130 million by Archbishop of Philadelphia Nelson J. Perez. On August 14, 2020, it was revealed that the Archdiocese of Philadelphia and its suffragan dioceses of Pittsburgh, Allentown and Scranton were enduring the bulk of 150 new lawsuits filed against all eight Pennsylvania Catholic dioceses.

On December 3, 2020, William McCandless, a member of the Wilmington-based religious order Oblates de St. Francis De Sales who was formerly assigned to DeSales University in Lehigh County, was charged in Philadelphia for possession of child pornography.

===Firing of Margie Winters for same-sex marriage===

In 2015, it was reported that the school&#x27;s director of religious education, Margie Winters, had been fired from the Waldron Mercy Academy after a parent had reported her directly to the Archdiocese of Philadelphia for marrying her long-term lesbian partner in a civil ceremony in 2007. Winters had been upfront with school administrators at the time of her hiring and was advised to keep a low profile which she says she did. Many parents expressed anger and concern over the school&#x27;s decision. Principal Nell Stetser justified the decision by arguing that &quot;many of us accept life choices that contradict current Church teachings, but to continue as a Catholic school, Waldron Mercy must comply with those teachings.&quot; But she called for &quot;an open and honest discussion about this and other divisive issues at the intersection of our society and our Church.&quot; The Archbishop of Philadelphia, Charles Chaput, called the dismissal &quot;common sense.&quot;

<text>Trawling is an industrial method of fishing that involves pulling a fishing net through the water behind one or more boats. The net used for trawling is called a trawl. This principle requires netting bags which are towed through water to catch different species of fishes or sometimes targeted species. Trawls are often called towed gear or dragged gear.

The boats that are used for trawling are called trawlers or draggers. Trawlers vary in size from small open boats with as little as 30 hp (22 kW) engines to large factory trawlers with over 10,000 hp (7.5 MW). Trawling can be carried out by one trawler or by two trawlers fishing cooperatively (pair trawling).

Trawling can be contrasted with trolling. While trawling involves a net and is typically done for commercial usage, trolling instead involves a reel, rod and a bait or a lure and is typically done for recreational purposes. Trawling is also commonly used as a scientific sampling, or survey, method.

==Bottom vs. midwater trawling==

Trawling can be divided into bottom trawling and midwater trawling, depending on how high the trawl (net) is in the water column. Bottom trawling is towing the trawl along (benthic trawling) or close to (demersal trawling) the sea floor. Bottom trawling is an industrial fishing method in which a large net with heavy weights is dragged across the seafloor, scooping up everything in its path. Bottom trawling can be disadvantageous because it can stir up significant amounts of sediments that lie on the sea bed and can harm some marine species. It also causes water pollutants to mix with some plankton, which in turn will move into the food chain, which will then create harmful algae blooms leading to insufficient oxygen. A 2021 study estimated that greenhouse gas emissions from bottom trawling were as much as aviation. However, the estimation methods in the original article published in the journal Nature, have been criticized by other scientists, claiming that the green house gas emission estimates are uncertain. Pr 2024 there is an intense scientific debate going on about this and no final conclusion can yet be drawn. Newer, trial methods employing bottom trawling gear that do not touch the seabed could potentially have lower environmental impact than livestock or fed aquaculture if employed.
Midway trawling or pelagic trawling target fishes that are living in the upper water column of the ocean. The funnel shaped trawl nets are hauled by one or two boats. This method is generally used to catch fishes of a single species. Unlike bottom trawling, this type of trawl does not come into contact with the sea bed and hence is not involved in damage of marine habitat. Some species caught with this trawling method are mackerel, herring, and hoki. However there may be some disadvantages in using this method as in the process of catching the targeted species of fish, one may end up capturing non targeted fish accidentally and thus discarding of juvenile commercial species of fish may impact on the population. Still, bycatch level is typically lower.

Midwater trawling is also known as pelagic trawling. Midwater trawling catches pelagic fish, whereas bottom trawling targets both bottom-living fish (groundfish) and semi-pelagic fish.

The gear itself can vary a great deal. Pelagic trawls are typically much larger than bottom trawls, with very large mesh openings in the net, little or no ground gear, and little or no chaffing gear. Additionally, pelagic trawl doors have different shapes than bottom trawl doors, although doors that can be used with both nets do exist.

==Net structure==
When two boats are used (pair trawling), the horizontal spread of the net is provided by the boats, with one or in the case of pelagic trawling two attached to each boat. However, single-boat trawling is more common. Here, the horizontal spread of the net is provided by trawl doors (also known as &quot;otter boards&quot;). Trawl doors are available in various sizes and shapes and may be specialized to keep in contact with the sea bottom (bottom trawling) or to remain elevated in the water. In all cases, doors essentially act as wings, using a hydrodynamic shape to provide horizontal spread. As with all wings, the towing vessel must go at a certain speed for the doors to remain standing and functional. This speed varies, but is generally in the range of 2.5–4.0 knots.

The vertical opening of a trawl net is created using flotation on the upper edge (&quot;floatline&quot;) and weight on the lower edge (&quot;footrope&quot;) of the net mouth. The configuration of the footrope varies based on the expected bottom shape. The more uneven the bottom, the more robust the footrope configuration must be to prevent net damage. This is used to catch shrimp, shellfish, cod, scallops and many others. Trawls are funnel-shaped nets that have a closed-off tail where the fish are collected and is open on the top end as the mouth.

Trawl nets can also be modified, such as changing mesh size, to help with marine research of ocean bottoms.

==Environmental effects==

Although trawling today is heavily regulated in some nations, it remains the target of many protests by environmentalists. Environmental concerns related to trawling refer to two areas: the lack of selectivity and the physical damage which the trawl does to the seabed.

===Selectivity===
Since the practice of trawling started (circa 14th century), there have been concerns over trawling&#x27;s lack of selectivity. Trawls may be non-selective, sweeping both marketable and undesirable fish and fish of both legal and illegal size. Any part of the catch which cannot be used is considered by-catch, some of which is killed accidentally by the trawling process. By-catch commonly includes valued species such as dolphins, sea turtles, and sharks, and may also include sublegal or immature individuals of the targeted species.

Many studies have documented large volumes of by-catch that are discarded. For example, researchers conducting a three-year study in the Clarence River found that an estimated 177 tons of by-catch (including 77 different species) were discarded each year.

Size selectivity is controlled by the mesh size of the &quot;cod-end&quot; — the part of the trawl where fish are retained. Fishermen complain that mesh sizes which allow undersized fish to escape also allow some legally catchable fish to escape. There are a number of &quot;fixes&quot;, such as tying a rope around the &quot;cod-end&quot; to prevent the mesh from opening fully, which have been developed to work around technical regulation of size selectivity. One problem is when the mesh gets pulled into narrow diamond shapes (rhombuses) instead of squares.

The capture of undesirable species is a recognized problem with all fishing methods and unites environmentalists, who do not want to see fish killed needlessly, and fishermen, who do not want to waste their time sorting marketable fish from their catch. A number of methods to minimize this have been developed for use in trawling. By-catch reduction grids (typically made of stainless steel or plastic) or square mesh panels of net can be fitted to parts of the trawl, allowing certain species to escape while retaining others. In fish trawls, the grid is mounted so the smallest organisms (juvenile fish, shrimp) pass through the grid and enter the sea again. In shrimp trawls, the grid pushes the largest organisms (fish) through a hole in the roof of the net, reducing by-catch of fish. The latter type of grid is mandatory in Norway and has been in use for 20 years. The grids are typically equipped with sensors that measure the angle of the grid, so the fishermen can tell whether the grid is working correctly.

Studies have suggested that shrimp trawling is responsible for the highest rate of by-catch.

===Physical damage ===
Trawling is controversial because of its environmental impacts. Because bottom trawling involves towing heavy fishing gear over the seabed, it can cause large-scale destruction on the ocean bottom, including coral shattering, damage to habitats and removal of seaweed.

The primary sources of impact are the doors, which can weigh several tonnes and create furrows if dragged along the bottom, and the footrope configuration, which usually remains in contact with the bottom across the entire lower edge of the net. Depending on the configuration, the footrope may turn over large rocks or boulders, possibly dragging them along with the net, disturb or damage sessile organisms or rework and re-suspend bottom sediments. These impacts result in decreases in species diversity and ecological changes towards more opportunistic organisms. The destruction has been likened to clear-cutting in forests.

The primary dispute over trawling concerns the magnitude and duration of these impacts. Opponents argue that they are widespread, intense and long-lasting. Defenders maintain that impact is mostly limited and of low intensity compared to natural events. However, most areas with significant natural sea bottom disturbance events are in relatively shallow water. In mid to deep waters, bottoms trawlers are the only significant area-wide events.

Bottom trawling on soft bottoms stirs up bottom sediments, loading suspended solids into the water column. It is estimated that 21.87 gigatons of sediment from the sea floor is resuspended annually due solely to the activity of trawlers. For scale, the amount of sediment deposited into the ocean by all rivers in the world is estimated to be 17.8 to 20 gigatons annually. When the turbidity plumes from bottom trawlers are below a thermocline, the surface may not be impacted, but less visible impacts can still occur, such as persistent organic pollutant transfer into the pelagic food chain. Rototilling the sea floor and resuspending bottom sediment affects the nutrient levels and changes the entire chemistry of the ambient water, greatly reducing the photosynthesizing ability of plants and kelps while also impacting any animal living on the ocean floor. An article published in &quot;New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research&quot; determined that the resuspended sediment creates anaerobic turbid conditions capable of killing scallop larvae that use the ocean floor as a habitat as they mature. The study also revealed that for filter feeders, despite there being more particulate matter in the water after a trawl, the protein per unit weight of sediment decreased, meaning they have to filter much more water for the same nutritional value. A 2021 study estimated annual carbon emissions from bottom trawling at almost 1.5 billion tonnes (about 3% of the world total) and recommended that more marine protected areas be established. Both the findings and the conclusions in the study have been scrutinized in more recent scientific works that do not come to the same conclusions as the mentioned study does. 

Despite these scientific disputes that to a large extent are oriented around scientific modelling, other effects of trawling are not disputed. A vast array of species are threatened by trawling around the world. In particular, trawling can directly kill coral reefs by breaking them up and burying them in sediments. In addition, trawling can kill corals indirectly by wounding coral tissue, leaving the reefs vulnerable to infection. The net effect of fishing practices on global coral reef populations is suggested by many scientists to be alarmingly high. Published research has shown that benthic trawling destroys the cold-water coral &quot;Lophelia pertusa&quot;, an important habitat for many deep-sea organisms.

Midwater (pelagic) trawling is a much &quot;cleaner&quot; method of fishing, in that the catch usually consists of just one species and does not physically damage the sea bottom. However, environmental groups have raised concerns that this fishing practice may be responsible for significant volumes of by-catch, particularly cetaceans (dolphins, porpoises, and whales).

== Studies on population and trawling ==

The population of Alaska&#x27;s Bristol Bay red king crab experienced an abrupt collapse during a three-year time span after 1980. During the 1970s the Bristol Bay red king crab fishery represented Alaska&#x27;s most valuable single-species fishery until 1980, then in 1982 the catch had dropped to zero and was an incredible example of a population crash. The cause of this crash was controversial with U.S. and Alaskan crab managers and modelers, with some stating the phenomena was a natural occurrence due to Pacific decadal oscillation, a shift in the location of warm and cold waters at an irregular pattern, while other marine biologists questioned the involvement of the new trawling fishery targeting Yellowfin sole in the area. Subsequently, a study was conducted by C. Braxton Dew and Robert A. McConnaughey in 2005 using data from the yearly Bristol Bay bottom-trawl survey conducted by the National Marine Fisheries Service and from the North Pacific fishery-observer database (NORPAC), to determine the effect of trawling on the population collapse.

When the U.S. commercial harvest of the legal male red king crab reached its peak in 1980 after a 10-year increase, a trawl fishery for Yellowfin sole was introduced. The new trawl fishery was located in the same area as the Bristol Bay Pot Sanctuary, which was dissolved in 1976. The pot sanctuary was introduced to protect the brood stock of female king crab which congregate in Bristol Bay to lay their fertilized eggs. During the active years of the pot sanctuary the only catch allowed in the area was male red king crab of regulation size caught in crab pots. During the first year of the joint U.S.-Soviet Yellowfin sole fishery, 1980, the bycatch rates for red king crab in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands increased by 371% over the average rates from 1977-1979. The following year, in 1981, the bycatch rate increased again another 235% over the 1980 rate, with most of the bycatch being mature females. As more unmonitored domestic trawls, trawls where bycatch is not reported, began in the area that was formerly the sanctuary, anecdotal reports of &quot;red bags,&quot; trawl bags with the cod-end, the end the fish are retained, plugged with red king crab began. During this time the percentage of males in the population jumped from 25% in 1981 and 16% in 1982 to 54% in 1985 and 65% in 1986. Due to the sudden change in the sex ratio, Dew and McConnaughey concluded that sequential, sex-specific sources of fishing mortality were at work.

Analyzing the findings of their study, Dew and McConnaughey determined a strong correlation between trawling activity and the sex ratio change as well as the total population decline. Dew and McConnaughey hypothesize that since female crabs return to and linger in Bristol Bay to lay pre-fertilized eggs, the trawling in the area disproportionally impacted the female population more than the male population and contributed to the change in sex ratio, as crabs do not die after they spawn. To account for the total change in population, they concluded the bycatch in trawls of female crabs with fertilized eggs contributed to the overall population decline, as less crab eggs were laid. Dew and McConnaughey noted that dissolving the Bristol Bay Pot Sanctuary exposed a vulnerable time in the red king crab&#x27;s mating cycle to trawling. Dew and McConnaughey concluded that even though trawling contributed to altering the sex ratio and total population of red king crab, it cannot be declared the sole factor that led to the population collapse as additional factors, such as climate change, likely played a role.

== Bycatch ==

=== Bycatch reporting ===

To ensure a non-biased estimate of bycatch, a fisheries observer, an independent field biologist, is deployed to every US-based trawling vessel when required by the regulations of the fishery. The responsibilities of an observer are to collect data on fishing activity, including areas and depth fished, and gear set and retrieval times; determine catch estimates, including the amount of each species discarded; gather data on individual fish, such as sex, length, and weight; and to compile bycatch data of protected species like marine mammals and seabirds. During every trawl the observer is to stand on deck as the catch is sorted and actively estimate the catch weight of each species of bycatch using a standardized method. The data gathered by observers is shared with multiple organizations, including NOAA, which publishes its findings in the annual National Bycatch Reports, which is used to set bycatch limits for protected or regulated species and determine mortality estimates for endangered species. The observer lives aboard the vessel with the crew for the duration of the trip which can last for days or weeks. However, the observer method of monitoring trawls may not be entirely effective. Certain fisheries have bycatch limits that end a vessel&#x27;s season if exceeded, and anecdotal reports of observers being pressured by crew and captain to lower their estimates have emerged. These reports center around the financial repercussions that the crew, who get paid a percentage of the total catch profits, would face if their vessel is barred from fishing. Although the reports are unverifiable, the observers claim that they underestimated the bycatch at rates of up to 50%. In 2006, an electronic method of observing bycatch that does not require an in-person observer was introduced in Canada. The monitoring method utilizes video cameras that record the retention or discarding of all fish at the hauling site during all fishing events and log time and GPS information. The data gathered from the cameras is used in conjunction with the vessel&#x27;s logs and dockside monitoring of the catch as it is being unloaded to construct an estimate of the total bycatch. Each of three data sets are also used to verify one another and can alert fisheries management to dishonest practices.

Some fisheries, in the US and abroad, do not mandate an observer while the vessel operates. In these fisheries, the bycatch data is either self-reported or not reported at all. In some instances, fisherman voluntarily self-report their bycatch data to oversight bodies. The fisheries with unmonitored trawls often catch bycatch that is not as valuable as the bycatch monitored fisheries or utilize midwater trawling which yields less bycatch than the more standard bottom trawling. Fisheries that forgo bycatch reporting are encouraged by organizations such as NOAA to report their bycatch to aid the effort of tracking the health of the fishery. As the health of the ocean in the future is uncertain due to climate change and other factors, providing biologists with accurate data about a source of fish mortality is essential to preserve the renewable resource that is wild caught seafood.

=== Cost ===
Regardless of the ecological effects of trawling, the cost of bycatch as trawlers operate poses an economic issue. It is estimated by Oceana that, worldwide, fishermen lose at least $1 billion worth of potential catch annually due to the disposal of bycatch. Any animal that is caught and discarded as bycatch often dies and cannot reproduce, negatively impacting the stock of the species. Bycatch is not limited to only inexpensive species of fish. Often, well known and prized fish species are disposed of as bycatch due to size and sex restrictions or because the vessel&#x27;s permit does not include the species. The highest cost associated with the bycatch of a single species is Pacific halibut, worth an annual $58.7 million. For halibut the massive bycatch cost can be attributed to trawlers catching more halibut as bycatch than the halibut fishery catches total. In 2014, seven times as many halibut were caught and discarded as trawl bycatch then in the directed fishery. Additionally, other prized fish species have an immense bycatch cost, the most costly are Sea trout worth $45.5 million, Atlantic sea scallop worth $32.7 million, red snapper worth $27.2 million, summer flounder worth $7.2 million, red grouper worth $6.7 million, Atlantic and Pacific cod worth $6.7 million, Tanner crab worth $4.6 million, king mackerel worth $4.3 million, sole worth $3.9 million, bluefin tuna worth $3.4 million, Chinook (king) salmon worth $1.4 million, and swordfish worth $1.3 million. The aforementioned estimates were determined using the wholesale market price that fishing vessels sell their fish to processors for, which is often cents on the dollar compared to the price at a store and were determined using bycatch reports from observed vessels, which have a dedicated observer to estimate the amount of bycatch a vessel captures and could be less than the true values.

Current estimates from Oceana find that 10% of all fish caught worldwide is disposed as bycatch, with some vessels returning more bycatch than what they keep per trawl. This lost potential catch of fish equates to upwards of 60,000 potential jobs for fisherman that would be needed to catch the same amount of fish in a directed fishery. Due to regulation, generally trawlers are unable to land and sell protected or regulated species caught as bycatch. Those who oppose trawling assert that since bycatch rarely returns to the ocean alive, the practice does not promote sustainable economic behavior, as each fish caught as bycatch from trawling becomes a waste product rather than being sold and eaten. Often fishermen have the means and knowledge to reduce the amount of bycatch, yet they lack the economic incentives. Examples of strategies to economically incentivize reducing bycatch are individual or pooled bycatch quotas, landings fees, risk pooling, or assurance bonds that have been implemented in other countries to encourage fishermen to adopt better practices. However, in Alaska some bycatch is utilized in a food share program created by a non-profit organization called SeaShare that is partnered with food banks across America. A group ex-trawler fishermen founded SeaShare in 1994 after successfully introducing changes to the National Marine Fisheries Service regulations to allow for the retention of bycatch solely for use by hunger-relief agencies. Since its inception SeasShare has donated 250 million servings of wild caught Alaskan seafood, totaling of utilized bycatch.

==Regulation==

In light of the environmental concerns surrounding trawling, many governments have debated policies that would regulate the practice.

==Anti-trawling devices==
Besides the aforementioned environmental objections, trawlers also run afoul of international borders and exclusive economic zones. Sometimes more local fishermen look at particular waters as theirs even when there is no legal requirement being violated, so some environmental groups, fishermen, and even governments have deployed anti-trawling devices.

<doc id="335844" wikidata="Q241092" url="?curid=335844" title="Debbie Stabenow">
<text>Deborah Ann Stabenow ( ; née Greer; born April 29, 1950) is an American politician who served from 2001 to 2025 as a United States senator from Michigan. A member of the Democratic Party, she was Michigan&#x27;s first female U.S. senator.

Before her election to the Senate, Stabenow was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, representing Michigan&#x27;s 8th congressional district from 1997 to 2001. Previously, she served on the Ingham County Board of Commissioners and in the Michigan State Legislature.

Stabenow was reelected to Senate in 2006, 2012, and 2018. She became the state&#x27;s senior U.S. senator upon Carl Levin&#x27;s retirement in 2015. Stabenow chaired the Senate Agriculture Committee from 2011 to 2015 and again since 2021. She became chair of the Senate Democratic Policy Committee in 2017. At the start of the 118th Congress, Stabenow became the dean of the Michigan congressional delegation, upon the retirement of Representative Fred Upton. In January 2023, she announced that she would not seek reelection in 2024.
==Early life, education, and early career==
Stabenow was born in Gladwin, Michigan, the daughter of Anna Merle (née Hallmark) and Robert Lee Greer. She grew up in Clare, Michigan. She graduated from Clare High School, where she was president of her junior class, the first female class president at the school. She received a Bachelor of Arts from Michigan State University in 1972 and a Master of Social Work &quot;magna cum laude&quot; from Michigan State University in 1975.

==Early political career==

===Ingham County politics===
While a graduate student at Michigan State University in 1974, Stabenow ran for public office for the first time, inspired by the threatened closure of a local nursing home. She won her first election in November 1974, becoming just the third woman elected to the Ingham County Board of Commissioners, on which she served from 1975 to 1978. Stabenow was the first woman and youngest person to date to chair the board of commissioners in 1977 and 1978. She was preceded as chair by one of her political mentors, Ken Hope. She was also instrumental in establishing a women&#x27;s commission in Ingham County.

===State legislature===
In 1978, Stabenow challenged Michigan State Representative Tom Holcomb in a primary election. She won the primary and eventually the general election for the 58th House District. Stabenow served in the Michigan House of Representatives from 1979 to 1990. She became a force in state Democratic politics and the first woman in House leadership to preside over the House. In 1990, Stabenow ran for the Michigan Senate seat being vacated by William A. Sederburg. She won the election, taking office in 1991 and serving one term through 1994.

===1994 gubernatorial election===

In 1994, Stabenow ran in Michigan&#x27;s Democratic gubernatorial primary to challenge incumbent Republican John Engler in the general election. U.S. Congressman Howard Wolpe won the primary with a plurality of 35% of the vote to Stabenow&#x27;s 30%. After the primary, Wolpe chose Stabenow as his running mate, and she appeared on the general election ballot as the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor. Engler defeated the Wolpe–Stabenow ticket, 61%–38%.

===U.S. House of Representatives===
In 1996, Stabenow ran for a seat in the United States House of Representatives, challenging incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman Dick Chrysler for the opportunity to represent Michigan&#x27;s 8th congressional district. She defeated Chrysler 54%–44%. In 1998, she was reelected with 57% of the vote. In the House, Stabenow served on the Agriculture and Science Committees.

==U.S. Senate==
===Elections===

====2000====
Stabenow did not seek reelection to the House in 2000, choosing instead to challenge incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Spencer Abraham. She won the Democratic primary unopposed. In the general election, Stabenow defeated Abraham 49.5%–48% (a difference of 67,259 votes).

====2006====
Stabenow was challenged by Republican Michael Bouchard, Oakland County sheriff and former State Senate Majority Floor Leader. Stabenow defeated him 57%–41%.

====2012====
Stabenow was unopposed in the Democratic primary and defeated Republican nominee Pete Hoekstra, former U.S. representative, 59% to 38%.

==== 2018 ====
Stabenow was reelected to a fourth term, defeating Republican nominee John E. James, 52.3%–45.8%. The margin was 275,660 votes (6.50%), making this the closest U.S. Senate election in Michigan since 2000.

===Tenure===

Before her final committee assignments, Stabenow also served on the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee and the Special Committee on Aging.

Stabenow is only the second person from Michigan to have served in both houses of the Michigan State Legislature and both houses of the United States Congress, the other being Thomas W. Ferry. She is also the first person to have served as a Michigan state legislator to be popularly elected to the U.S. Senate (until enactment of the 17th Amendment in 1913, U.S. senators were selected by state legislatures).

Stabenow became the third-ranking Democrat in the Senate on November 16, 2004, when she was elected secretary of the Democratic caucus. As caucus secretary, she assisted Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid in setting the Democratic agenda and priorities. Senator Dick Durbin was elected minority whip, the second-ranking Democratic spot. In November 2006, Reid announced that Stabenow would leave the caucus secretary position to succeed Hillary Clinton as chair of the Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee, charged with &quot;engag[ing] Democratic Senators and community leaders across the country in an active dialogue&quot;.

After Tom Daschle, President Barack Obama&#x27;s nominee for United States Secretary of Health and Human Services, withdrew from consideration, the National Organization for Women urged the president to appoint Stabenow, citing her focus on health care and her background as a social worker.

Stabenow became chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee in 2011, following the defeat of Blanche Lincoln. A controversial item during Stabenow&#x27;s tenure was the renewal and reform of the 2012 U.S. Farm Bill. Reid reintroduced 2012&#x27;s Senate Farm Bill in the 113th Congress in January 2013, saying that it was on his top priority list, and Stabenow voiced support for Reid&#x27;s move, saying, &quot;Majority Leader Reid has demonstrated that the Senate will once again make supporting our nation&#x27;s agriculture economy while cutting spending a top priority.&quot;

On October 29, 2014, Stabenow introduced the Gun Lake Trust Land Reaffirmation Act (S. 1603; 113th Congress), a bill that would reaffirm the status of lands taken into trust by the Department of the Interior for the benefit of the Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band. The bill would clarify that the Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band&#x27;s land trust could not be challenged in court under the Supreme Court decision &quot;Carcieri v. Salazar&quot;.

Stabenow was participating in the certification of the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count when Trump supporters attacked the United States Capitol. Along with other senators and staff, she was evacuated from the Senate chamber through a stairwell and taken to a safe location. She called the experience &quot;heartbreaking&quot; and &quot;one of those things out of a movie&quot; and said she had not felt that much fear since her time at the Capitol during the September 11 attacks. After the Capitol was secure, Congress returned to session to certify the election. Stabenow supported the certification. The day after the attack, Stabenow called for Trump&#x27;s immediate removal from office through the invocation of the 25th Amendment or impeachment.

===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry (chair)
**As chairperson, Senator Stabenow was an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of all subcommittees.
*Committee on the Budget

==Political positions==
The American Conservative Union gave Stabenow a 6% lifetime conservative rating in 2020.

===Abortion===
Stabenow supports keeping abortion legal. She has voted to expand embryonic stem cell research, and against prohibiting minors crossing state lines for abortions, barring HHS grants to institutions that perform abortions, and criminal penalties for harm or death to a fetus in a violent crime.

===Cannabis legalization===
Stabenow supported Michigan Proposal 1 in 2018 to legalize cannabis for recreational use, though she would like to ensure law enforcement is involved so that the law is implemented correctly.

===Food assistance===
In 2013, Greg Kaufmann of &quot;The Nation&quot; wrote an article stating that Stabenow was prepared to cut $8 to $9 billion from the food stamp (SNAP) program. In a lengthy statement, Stabenow&#x27;s office rejected these accusations, maintaining that she &quot;strongly opposes any changes to food assistance that make cuts in benefits for people who need help putting food on the table&quot; and that she &quot;has been the number one defender against the House Republican proposal to cut food assistance by $40 billion.&quot; Kaufmann doubled down on his charges and challenged Stabenow&#x27;s office&#x27;s claims in detail.

In 2017, Stabenow fought to prevent the creation of additional work-requirement rules on SNAP recipients who were older or had smaller children and led a bipartisan effort to get the legislation passed.

===Foreign policy===
In October 2002, Stabenow was one of 23 senators who voted against authorization of the use of military force in Iraq.

In April 2019, Stabenow was one of 34 senators to sign a letter to President Donald Trump encouraging him &quot;to listen to members of your own Administration and reverse a decision that will damage our national security and aggravate conditions inside Central America&quot;, asserting that Trump had &quot;consistently expressed a flawed understanding of U.S. foreign assistance&quot; since becoming president and that he was &quot;personally undermining efforts to promote U.S. national security and economic prosperity&quot; by preventing the use of Fiscal Year 2018 national security funding. The senators argued that foreign assistance to Central American countries created less migration to the U.S. by helping to improve conditions in those countries.

===Flint water===
Stabenow secured $100 million to repair and replace the water lines in Flint, Michigan, which were contaminating the drinking water with lead. She also pushed to include a program that would provide fresh fruits and vegetables to Flint children as part of the Farm Bill.

===Economic issues===

Stabenow received low scores from free-market groups (Competitive Enterprise Institute, 2013, 0%; American Conservative Union, 2016, 0%; Americans for Prosperity, 2015–16, 0%) and high scores from fiscally liberal groups (Progressive Punch, 2015, 92%; NETWORK, A National Catholic Social Justice Lobby, 2012, 91%).

In 2007, Senator Stabenow joined the bipartisan (70-23) support of NOPEC in order to combat conspiratorial policies by foreign oil producers, extending Sherman Anti-Trust Act protection to include foreign cartels such as OPEC, and bring down US oil and gas costs for US consumers. In 2008, she voted against the Troubled Asset Relief Program proposed by President George W. Bush.

In 2009, Stabenow voted for President Barack Obama&#x27;s $787 billion stimulus plan.

In 2010, she introduced the China Fair Trade Act, saying it would &quot;prevent federal taxpayer dollars from being used to purchase Chinese products and services until they sign on to and abide by the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement.&quot; The bill would also require a report on Chinese industrial policies and require the Department of Energy to monitor the development of China&#x27;s renewable energy sector.

In October 2011, Stabenow called for tax breaks for firms developing bio-based products, using crops like soybeans and corn to create prescriptions drugs, plastics, and soaps.

In August 2012, Stabenow expressed support for &quot;strategic partnerships between farmers and industry&quot; and for a recent Obama directive to boost federal purchases of bio-based products.

In 2015, she introduced the Stabenow-Portman Amendment (SA 1299) to address currency manipulation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

In 2015, the International Economic Development Council gave Stabenow the Congressional Leadership Award &quot;for her significant contributions in the area of economic development.&quot; The IEDC cited her work on the 2014 Farm Bill, her sponsorship in 2013 of the New Skills for New Jobs Act, and her role in the federal bridge loan program.&quot;

In 2017, Stabenow introduced her American Jobs Agenda, which included two acts: the Make It In America Act and the Bring Jobs Home Act. The former, &quot;would close loopholes in a 1933 law designed to give American companies priority when the federal government purchases goods.&quot; She said the act would require that the U.S. government: &quot;buy American...If the federal agency says they need a waiver, they need to measure how many American jobs will be impacted by purchasing that product made overseas.&quot; The latter, &quot;would create a tax cut for companies bringing jobs and business activities back to America from another country.&quot;

In April 2017, Stabenow was one of eight Democratic senators to sign a letter to Trump noting government-subsidized Chinese steel had been placed into the American market in recent years below cost and had hurt the domestic steel industry and the iron ore industry that fed it, calling on him to raise the steel issue with President of China Xi Jinping in his meeting with him.

In May 2017, she and Senator Gary Peters announced a $210,000 EDA grant to the West Michigan Shoreline Regional Development Commission &quot;to help spur economic development in West Michigan.&quot; The same month, she said that owing to a major change in farmers&#x27; margins since the 2014 Farm Bill, the farm safety net needed to be strengthened, especially for dairy farmers.

At a July 13, 2017, economics roundtable, she said that the &quot;#1 request she gets in Michigan&quot; is for &quot;Professional technical jobs, building construction jobs—folks that can actually make things and do things.&quot; She said that Democrats can succeed in elections by &quot;going to our core. We are the party that are willing to take risks to make things better...We believe in our core in an economy that actually works for everybody. That is how you grow America.&quot;

The Biotechnology Industry Organization thanked Stabenow in 2017 for supporting development of a &quot;biobased economy,&quot; specifically for her introduction of the Renewable Chemicals Act of 2017, which would &quot;allow taxpayers to claim a production tax credit of 15 cents per pound of biobased content of each renewable chemical produced during the taxable year.&quot;

On October 3, 2017, Stabenow and Peters introduced the Small Business Access to Capital Act, designed to &quot;reauthorize and improve the State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) to help small businesses grow and create jobs.&quot; It built &quot;on the successful SSBCI initiative that both lawmakers championed in the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010&quot; and that &quot;funds the Michigan Economic Development Corporation and other state-led lending programs that leverage private financing to help small businesses access the capital they need.&quot;

===Immigration===
Stabenow received high marks from groups supporting immigration (American Immigration Lawyers Association, 2013–14, 100%; National Hispanic Leadership Agenda, 2013–14, 100%) and low marks from groups opposed to immigration: Federation for American Immigration Reform, 2014, 0%; Numbers USA, 2017, 0%.

During the two-day January 2018 government shutdown, Stabenow was among 81 senators who effectively ended the shutdown by approving a three-week stopgap spending bill that &quot;included reauthorizing the Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program for six years&quot;. This agreement was obtained after the Republican leadership &quot;pledged to soon take up immigration legislation&quot;. She said they had &quot;reached a bipartisan agreement that funds children&#x27;s health insurance and moves us closer to a solution that provides long-term certainty for Michigan families and our national defense&quot;.

In January 2017, she opposed Trump&#x27;s executive order temporarily limiting immigration from several Muslim majority countries, saying it: &quot;is ruining America&#x27;s reputation in the world, undermining our relationships with our most critical allies, and most heartbreakingly, destroying the lives of good and law-abiding people.&quot;

Stabenow voted against providing COVID-19 pandemic financial support to undocumented immigrants on February 4, 2021.

===International relations===
Stabenow supported Obama&#x27;s Iran deal that sought to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons for 10 years and attempted to halt their uranium production.

===Income inequality===
Recounting a 2014 Senate hearing on income inequality, George Packer singled out Stabenow as the only committee member who pushed back on the idea that it was caused largely by the withdrawal from the workforce of middle-aged people who preferred to collect welfare. Stabenow &quot;pointed out that almost all the voters she heard from in high-unemployment Michigan still wanted to work.&quot;

===Government spending===
She received low scores from low-spending advocates (Club for Growth, 2016, 8%; Council for Citizens against Government Waste, 2015, 0%; National Taxpayers Union, 2015, 9%).

===Education===

In 2011, Stabenow introduced the Reengaging Americans in Serious Education Act (RAISE UP Act), whereby the Labor Department would fund programs to help &quot;disconnected youth&quot; get diplomas, degrees, and job certifications. In 2012, she co-sponsored a bill to freeze student loan interest rates at 3.4 percent and make additional funds available for Pell Grants.

In 2016, Stabenow and others introduced the Reducing Educational Debt Act, which she promoted with the #InTheRed hashtag.

She expressed &quot;strong concerns&quot; about Trump&#x27;s nomination of Betsy DeVos as Education Secretary, saying: &quot;DeVos and her family have a long record of pushing policies that I believe have seriously undermined public education in Michigan and failed our children.&quot;

===Gun policy===
Stabenow supports gun control and supports a national assault weapons ban.
After the Orlando nightclub shooting, Stabenow participated in the Chris Murphy gun control filibuster. One month later, she supported bills to ban people on the terrorist watchlist from buying guns and to expand background checks. Neither bill passed the Senate. Stabenow blamed the National Rifle Association of America (NRA) for the bills&#x27; failure to pass.

In 2017, following the Las Vegas shooting, Stabenow and Debbie Dingell introduced a law that would make it illegal for people convicted of misdemeanor stalking to buy guns.

Stabenow has an &quot;A+&quot; rating from the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and an &quot;F&quot; rating from both the NRA and the Gun Owners of America.

===Health care===
Stabenow had helped open 10 community health centers in Detroit while in office.

She received high scores from Planned Parenthood (2017, 100%) and low scores from National Right to Life Committee, (2013, 0%).

In the 2000 campaign, she: &quot;promised to make the pharmaceutical industry lower prescription drug prices, to maintain Social Security benefits and to give Medicare a new prescription drug plan.&quot; She pledged to &quot;fight the pharmaceutical and insurance industries—the two industries that spend the most money lobbying federal officials&quot; and accused the pharmaceutical industry of &quot;making up to 20 percent net profit each year...on the backs of families, seniors and businesses.&quot; Her spokesperson said: &quot;In the last election, I think the pharmaceutical industry spent more campaigning against her than any other candidate...She was enemy number one.&quot; Stabenow voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in December 2009, and for the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. She also sponsored S. 2257, the Excellence in Mental Health Act.

On September 1, 2016, she said that approving money to combat Zika was a top congressional priority.

In August 2019, Stabenow was one of 19 senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin and United States Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar requesting data from the Trump administration in order to help states and Congress understand the potential consequences in the event that the Texas v. United States Affordable Care Act (ACA) lawsuit prevailed in courts, writing that an overhaul of the present health care system would form &quot;an enormous hole in the pocketbooks of the people we serve as well as wreck state budgets&quot;.

===Housing===
In April 2019, Stabenow was one of 41 senators to sign a bipartisan letter to the housing subcommittee praising the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development&#x27;s Section 4 Capacity Building program as authorizing &quot;HUD to partner with national nonprofit community development organizations to provide education, training, and financial support to local community development corporations (CDCs) across the country&quot; and expressing disappointment that Trump&#x27;s budget &quot;has slated this program for elimination after decades of successful economic and community development.&quot; The senators wrote of their hope that the subcommittee would support continued funding for Section 4 in Fiscal Year 2020.

===Defense===
In December 2011, Stabenow voted in favor of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012. The bill included highly controversial provisions, drafted by Senators Carl Levin and John McCain in closed session, that would allow for the indefinite military detention without trial of American citizens deemed potential terrorists and enemies of the state.

===Environment===

====Climate change====
On August 10, 2009, Stabenow was reported by &quot;The Detroit News&quot; as saying, &quot;Global warming creates volatility. I feel it when I&#x27;m flying. The storms are more volatile. We are paying the price in more hurricanes and tornadoes.&quot; She has, however, opposed regulation of greenhouse gases, enhanced fuel efficiency standards in California, and greenhouse gas emission reporting standards.

Stabenow voted for the SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act of 2011 (S.493). In March 2011, &quot;ThinkProgress&quot; accused her of joining &quot;the pro-polluter frenzy sweeping the U.S. Senate,&quot; saying that the legislation was: &quot;being used as a vehicle for senators who wish to prevent regulation of greenhouse pollution from oil refineries, coal-fired power plants, heavy industry, and other major emitters. Stabenow has added her amendment to three others intended to hamstring the Environmental Protection Agency on behalf of carbon polluters.&quot;

Stabenow&#x27;s proposed amendment to keep the EPA from regulating greenhouse gas emissions for two years also drew criticism. The amendment would have given “coal-fired power plants, oil refineries and other industrial sources a two year exemption” from rules requiring them to report greenhouse gas emissions. She defended her position by calling her amendment: &quot;a common-sense approach that allows protections from carbon pollution, determined by scientists and public health experts, to continue being developed while providing businesses the support and incentives they need as they reduce pollution, generate new clean energy technologies and create jobs.&quot;

In February 2019, in response to reports of the EPA intending to decide against setting drinking water limits for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) as part of an upcoming national strategy to manage the chemicals, Stabenow was one of 20 senators to sign a letter to Acting EPA Administrator Andrew R. Wheeler calling on the agency: &quot;to develop enforceable federal drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS, as well as institute immediate actions to protect the public from contamination from additional per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).&quot;

====Drilling in the Great Lakes====
In 2010, Stabenow called for a total ban on drilling in the Great Lakes. Critics noted that &quot;a U.S. federal ban on all oil and natural gas offshore drilling in the Great Lakes&quot; had already &quot;been in place since 2005&quot; and that Canada banned offshore oil drilling but had &quot;roughly 500 offshore gas wells in Lake Erie&quot; plus 23 &quot;slant wells&quot; that &quot;drill for oil on shore but extend under Lake Erie.&quot; In 2015, Stabenow and Gary Peters introduced the Pipeline Improvement and Preventing Spills Act &quot;to ban shipping of crude oil by vessel on the Great Lakes and require a comprehensive, top-to-bottom review of hazardous pipelines in the region.&quot;

In May 2017, Stabenow expressed support for the bipartisan effort to retain funding for The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.

In September 2016, Stabenow and Peters led an effort to link an aid package for the Flint water crisis to flood relief funds for Louisiana.

====Canadian waste disposal====
On August 31, 2006, Stabenow, Senator Carl Levin and Representative John Dingell announced an agreement that would completely cease Ontario&#x27;s dumping of solid waste in Michigan within four years. This had been an issue in Michigan for the past several years. Stabenow had previously introduced legislation in the Senate intended to reduce the dumping of Canadian trash in Michigan. In July 2006, the Senate unanimously passed a law sponsored by Stabenow requiring the payment of a $420 inspection fee for every truckload of Canadian trash brought into Michigan.

===Fairness doctrine===
Asked in 2009 by Bill Press whether she would support a return of the Fairness Doctrine, under which the federal government enforced an ideological &quot;balance&quot; on the airwaves, Stabenow said yes: &quot;I absolutely think it&#x27;s time to be bringing accountability to the airwaves.&quot; Asked whether she would push for Senate hearings on the subject, she said, &quot;I have already had some discussions with colleagues and, you know, I feel like that&#x27;s gonna happen. Yep.&quot; It has been noted that Stabenow&#x27;s then husband was Tom Athans, an executive in left-wing radio (Air America, Democracy Radio), whose career would have benefited from such legislation.

Stabenow is probably the most prominent politician to seriously support a new Fairness Doctrine.

===GMOs===
Stabenow, as Senate Agriculture Committee Chair, added an amendment to the 2013–14 Farm Bill that prohibited state laws requiring GMO labeling for foods. She has been criticized because this amendment aided Monsanto and other agribusinesses, which donated over three-quarters of a million dollars to her campaign during that election cycle. In 2016, she was again criticized for her role in the passage of a law that overruled state laws mandating GMO labeling.

===Trump nominations===
In January 2017, Stabenow opposed Trump&#x27;s nomination of Jeff Sessions as AG: &quot;Because of his record on civil rights and his votes against anti-domestic violence legislation, I cannot support him to be our nation&#x27;s highest law enforcement officer...Families in Michigan and across the country deserve an attorney general who will enforce the nation&#x27;s laws fairly and equally.&quot;

That March, she opposed Trump&#x27;s nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court: &quot;After reviewing Judge Gorsuch&#x27;s rulings, it is clear that he has a long record of siding with special interests and institutions instead of hard-working Americans. And, therefore, in my judgment, he does not meet this standard of balance and impartiality.&quot;

In July 2018, citing his past rulings on presidential powers, she opposed the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, furthermore stating that the FBI should perform a background check regarding multiple allegations of sexual assault.

She similarly opposed Trump&#x27;s 2020 nomination of Amy Coney Barrett, stating: &quot;It&#x27;s very clear from her writings, multiple writings, that she will be the vote that takes away health care for millions of Americans, including 130 million people and counting with pre-existing conditions...&quot; She voted against the nomination while wearing a face mask depicting Barrett&#x27;s predecessor Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

===Retirement===
On January 5, 2023, Stabenow announced her intention to retire from the Senate. Her announcement cited a desire to &quot;pass the torch&quot; to Michigan&#x27;s next generation of leadership: &quot;I have always believed it&#x27;s not enough to be the first unless there is a second and a third&quot;. She also noted time with family as a motivation for her retirement. If she serves in the Senate until her term ends in January 2025, she will have held elected office for 50 years. In February 2023, Michigan Representative Elissa Slotkin launched a campaign to succeed Stabenow in the Senate.

==Awards and honors==
In February 2023, a portrait of Stabenow by Michigan artist Joshua Adam Risner was unveiled in the Russell Senate Office Building. Congressional committee chairs traditionally receive portraits in their committee rooms. Stabenow&#x27;s portrait came due to her years as chair of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. It was commissioned by the Historical Society of Michigan.

On October 3, 2024, Washington Park in Lansing, Michigan was renamed Debbie Stabenow Park in her honor.

==Personal life==
Stabenow is a member of the United Methodist Church.

Stabenow was first married to Dennis Stabenow. The couple had two children and divorced in 1990.

In 2003, Stabenow married Tom Athans, co-founder of Democracy Radio and former executive vice president of Air America. She has a stepdaughter from this marriage. They divorced in 2010.

Stabenow had a cameo appearance in the 2016 film &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot; as governor of the unspecified state in which Metropolis is located. She was invited to appear because the scene was filmed in Michigan, and for her support for film-industry incentives.

In 2024, Stabenow declined to run for a fifth Senate term, citing a wish to spend more time with her family, including her 96-year-old mother.

<text>Carl Milton Levin (June 28, 1934 – July 29, 2021) was an American attorney and politician who served as a United States senator from Michigan from 1979 to 2015. A member of the Democratic Party, he was the chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee from 2001 to 2003 and again from 2007 to 2015.

Born in Detroit, Levin graduated from Swarthmore College and Harvard Law School. He worked as the general counsel of the Michigan Civil Rights Commission from 1964 to 1967, and as a special assistant attorney general for the Michigan Attorney General&#x27;s Office. Levin was a member of the Detroit City Council from 1969 to 1977, serving as the council&#x27;s president for the last four of those years.

In 1978, Levin ran for the United States Senate, defeating Republican incumbent Robert P. Griffin. Levin was re-elected in 1984, 1990, 1996, 2002, and 2008. On March 7, 2013, Levin announced that he would not seek a seventh term to the Senate. On March 9, 2015, Levin announced he was joining the Detroit-based law firm Honigman Miller Schwartz and Cohn LLP. At the same time, he founded the Levin Center at Wayne State University Law School, dedicated to &quot;strengthening the integrity, transparency, and accountability of public and private institutions by promoting and supporting bipartisan, fact-based oversight; advancing good governance, particularly with respect to the legislative process; and promoting civil discourse on current issues of public policy&quot;.

Levin became Michigan&#x27;s senior senator in 1995, and he was the longest-serving senator in the state&#x27;s history. At the time of his retirement Levin was the fourth longest-serving incumbent in the U.S. Senate. He released his memoir, &quot;Getting to the Heart of the Matter: My 36 Years in the Senate&quot;, in March 2021. It was published by Wayne State University Press.

==Early life, education, and career==
Levin was born in Detroit, the son of Jewish parents, Bess Rachel (née Levinson) and Saul R. Levin. Saul served on the Michigan Corrections Commission. Levin graduated from Detroit Central High School in 1952 and attended Swarthmore College. He graduated with his Bachelor of Arts in political science in 1956. During his student summers he worked as a taxi driver and on an auto factory line. He then attended Harvard Law School, where he earned his Juris Doctor in 1959. He also received an honorary degree from Swarthmore College in 1980, as well as honorary degrees from Michigan State University in 2004, Wayne State University in 2005, and Michigan Technological University in 2008.

After earning his Juris Doctor, Levin was admitted to the State Bar of Michigan. He entered private practice as a lawyer for Grossman, Hyman and Grossman and taught law at Wayne State University and the University of Detroit Mercy. Levin served as General Counsel for the Michigan Civil Rights Commission from 1964 to 1967, where he helped form the Detroit Public Defender&#x27;s Office and led the Appellate Division of that office, which has become the State Appellate Defender&#x27;s Office. He served as a special assistant attorney general for the state of Michigan and chief appellate defender for the city of Detroit from 1968 to 1969.

===Detroit City Council===

Levin was elected to the Detroit City Council (known then as the Detroit Common Council) in 1969, serving two four-year terms from 1970 to 1977. Levin served as president of the City Council throughout his entire second term, until the end of his tenure. During his time as council president, Levin became so frustrated with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development&#x27;s handling of repossessed houses in Detroit (leading neighborhoods to suffer from significant urban decay), that he and other members of the council, went out with a bulldozer &quot;to help raze some of the houses.&quot; He was close to Detroit Mayor Coleman Young, the city&#x27;s first African-American Mayor, and was described by &quot;Forbes&quot; as Mayor Young&#x27;s &quot;right hand man.&quot; During his time on the City Council, Levin practiced law part-time, working as a counsel for the Schlussel, Lifton, Simon, Rands and Kaufman law firm from 1971 to 1973. He later served as the general counsel at Jaffe, Snider, Raitt, Garratt and Heuer, from 1978 to 1979.

==United States Senate==

Levin was elected to the United States Senate in 1978, defeating incumbent Republican Senator Robert P. Griffin.

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Armed Services (chairman)
** As chairman of the full committee, Sen. Levin served as an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of all subcommittees
* Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs
** Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management, Government Information, Federal Services, and International Security
** Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, the Federal Workforce, and the District of Columbia (chair)
** Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (chair)
* Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship
* Select Committee on Intelligence

===Legislation sponsored===
Levin was the sponsor of 51 bills that became law.

==Political positions==
===Armed services===
Levin chaired the Armed Services Committee from 2001 to 2003 and from 2007 until his retirement in 2015. He became the Democratic ranking member on the committee on January 7, 1997, and served in that position when the Democratic Party was in the minority. Levin previously chaired the committee when the Democratic Party was the majority party in the Senate, January 3–20, 2001 and June 6, 2001 – January 6, 2003.

Levin joined the Armed Services Committee upon joining the Senate. Recalling when he was assigned the committee seat, he said that he wanted to learn more about the armed services. &quot;I had never served, and I thought there was a big gap in terms of my background and, frankly, felt it was a way of providing service.&quot;

He was a strong advocate for cost controls regarding military procurements. He has also pushed for less secrecy in government, working to declassify many documents, particularly where false and misleading claims of ties between Iraq and al-Qaeda are concerned.

Having believed that in order to improve the military the United States needed to shut down unneeded installations and get rid of excess infrastructure, Levin helped lead passage of the Defense Base Realignment and Closure Act, which closed some military bases.

Levin supported the Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, ensuring that all nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons from post-Soviet states, are secured and dismantled. Levin argued that Nunn-Lugar presented &quot;a chance to bury the new Hitlers and Stalins of that region before they have a chance to take root.&quot; After members of the U.S. House of Representatives and then-Senator Bob Smith (R-NH) threatened to redirect funds from the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Levin joined a bipartisan group of senators in opposition to the 20% reduction in funding. In 2003, he voted in favor of the Nunn-Lugar Expansion Act, expanding the provisions to non-Soviet countries, and in 2005 cosponsored Senate Amendment 1030, removing congressionally imposed restrictions that delay the implementations of 2003 expansion act.

In 1992, he voted to ratify the START I treaty, and for the ratification of START II in 1996, banning MIRV&#x27;s and Intercontinental ballistic missiles. In 2010, Levin voted in favor of the New START Treaty, extending the original treaty until 2021 and reducing both the U.S. and Russia&#x27;s deployed strategic nuclear arsenal, by almost two-thirds. In an op-ed in &quot;The Hill&quot;, Levin said that, &quot;This treaty is a strong statement that the United States is committed to reducing the dangers to the world that nuclear weapons present. That commitment makes it easier for us to work with the international community.&quot;

During the 2009 MDA/AIAA Annual Missile Defense Conference, Levin spoke in favor of the U.S.-Russian cooperation on missile defense: &quot;Leaders in both the U.S. and Russia have recently expressed interest in exploring missile defense cooperation. Did you ever believe that some of our missile defense engineers and experts might be working together with their Russian counterparts? It could happen and if it does, it could help address a major threat. The bottom line is simple: We have a new opportunity to seek a cooperative approach with Russia on missile defense, and we should seize it. The upside potential of such an effort is huge – a geopolitical game changer. The downside is minimal.&quot;

As Chair of the Armed Services Committee, Levin was instrumental in the enactment of the Matthew Shephard and James Byrd, Jr., Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 and the legislation ending &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell&quot; policy for gays in the military in 2010. He played a vital role in the enactment of legislation addressing the problem of sexual assault in the military in 2013 and 2014.

Levin led Senate investigations into the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and Abu Ghraib. He also played a key role in the enactment of the Detainee Treatment Act, which prohibited the torture of detainees in U.S. custody. Levin insisted on the inclusion of language that, as affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court, ensured that the legislation would not deprive detainees of their right to access to the federal courts under a writ of habeas corpus. Under Levin&#x27;s leadership, the Senate Armed Services Committee conducted oversight hearings ranging from counterfeit parts in the DOD procurement system to the use of private security contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan.

In 2014, Levin was recognized by the Jewish Community Center Association of North America with the Frank L. Weil Jewish Military Award for legislation that has benefitted Jews and other minorities serving in the military.

====Afghanistan war====

After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Levin voted in favor of Senate Joint Resolution 23, authorizing President George W. Bush the use of &quot;necessary and appropriate force&quot; against those who &quot;planned, authorized, committed or aided&quot; al-Qaeda and its affiliates.

Levin grew critical of the Bush administration&#x27;s handling of the Afghanistan War, saying in 2005 that they &quot;took their eye off the ball when we decided to go after Iraq instead of al-Qaeda, the people who had attacked us on 9/11, and their leader. In 2008, Levin became concerned that the United States and the international community lacked a strategy for success in Afghanistan, and that NATO failed to supply troops and equipment needed in emergency situations.

Levin was opposed to the 2009 Afghanistan troop surge (adding 30,000 U.S. combat troops), stressing the advancement of training and expanding the Afghan National Army; saying that the ANA should increase to 240,000 by 2012, from the original goal of 134,000, and the number of active members of the Afghan National Police should expand to 160,000, from the initial goal of 96,000. Though Levin advocated a &quot;surge of Afghan security forces,&quot; he said that he wouldn&#x27;t rule out temporarily expanding the number of combat forces, but stuck with his original position. He questioned top Obama administration officials including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates during a senate hearing on the Afghanistan surge, saying that, &quot;Where I have questions is whether the rapid deployment of a large number of U.S. combat forces, without an adequate number of Afghan security forces for our troops to partner with, serves that mission.&quot; Levin opposed setting a timetable for Afghanistan, voting against Senate Amendment 4204, requiring the President to submit a safe and orderly redeployment plan for combat troops and a plan to set a date for withdrawal, saying that, &quot;I don&#x27;t think we know enough about how these events are gonna unfold, for there to be a deadline.&quot; Levin supported the U.S. keeping a &quot;limited footprint&quot; in troops and in bases in Afghanistan, and said at that time he would focus the remainder of his senate tenure on the &quot;rapid transfer of responsibility for Afghan security to the Afghans.&quot;

====Iraq war====

Levin was an early opponent of using U.S. military force in Iraq, saying in August 2002 that &quot;if Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, he wouldn&#x27;t use them,&quot; and that &quot;he&#x27;s a survivalist, not a suicide bomber&quot;. Levin proposed the failed Multilateral Use of Force Authorization Act, as an alternative to the Iraq Resolution, pushing President George W. Bush to build an international coalition in conjunction with the United Nations, so that &quot;Saddam will be looking down the barrel of a gun, with the world at the other end rather than just the United States.&quot;

Levin was one of 23 Senators who voted against the Iraq Resolution, saying that &quot;If we are going to take on Saddam at some point, it is critical that we have the world with us, that there be a U.N. resolve that authorizes war, because the consequences are very, very severe. If we go without a declaration from the U.N. it is far better to have one, and that means that we&#x27;ve got to bring the world along here.&quot; Levin has strongly argued that the War in Iraq was a diversion from the War on Terror. On &quot;CNN&quot; on November 14, 2005, Levin said that &quot;before the war, the President was saying that you cannot distinguish between Saddam Hussein and Iraq. As a matter of fact, he said that so often that he tried to connect Saddam Hussein with the attackers on us, on 9/11, so often, so frequently and so successfully, even though it was wrong, that the American people overwhelmingly thought, because of the President&#x27;s misstatements that as a matter of fact, Saddam Hussein had participated in the attack on us on 9/11. That was a deception. That was clearly misinformation. It had a huge effect on the American people.&quot;

Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki hit back at senior U.S. politicians who have called for al-Maliki to be removed from office. He singled out Levin and Hillary Clinton, saying the Democratic senators were acting as if Iraq was &quot;their property&quot; and that they should &quot;come to their senses&quot; and &quot;respect democracy&quot;.

After the 2006 midterm elections, with the Democratic Party taking control of the Senate and Levin being reappointed Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, he was seen to have gained an influential position to oppose the Bush administration&#x27;s Iraq policy, initially proposing efforts for &quot;phased withdrawals&quot;. Though on January 10, 2007, after Bush announced intentions to send an additional 20,000 troops to Iraq, Levin said that he would support the plan if it were tied to a broader strategy of reducing the overall amount of U.S. troops; receiving opposition from his own party. In late January 2007, amid what was seen as the fiercest political battle over the Iraq strategy during the Iraq War, Levin joined a bipartisan group of senators, including then Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Joe Biden (D-DE), Susan Collins (R-ME), and Chuck Hagel (R-NE), to oppose any further escalation in Iraq; and in voting in March 2007, in favor of setting a withdrawal date for U.S. forces in Iraq. After continued criticism over the Iraq War troop surge, in August 2007, Levin and senator John Warner (R-VA), visited military bases in Mosul and Baghdad, saying that the surge brought &quot;credible and positive results,&quot; though it failed to bring the political reconciliation needed and urged the Iraqi Parliament to hold a &quot;no-confidence vote&quot; on the government of Prime Minister al-Maliki. In October 2011, Levin said that President Barack Obama made the &quot;right decision&quot; in withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq at the end of 2011, and not continuing a U.S. military presence.

====National Defense Authorization Act 2012====
As part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (the main annual bill used to fund the US military) Levin and Senator John McCain (ranking Republican on Armed Services Committee-AZ) included provisions that affirmed the authority of the United States military to detain captured individuals, including terrorists, in accordance with the law of war and required such detention for members of al Qaeda and others who planned or carried out the attacks against the United States. As initially proposed the provisions applied to American citizens. After objections were raised that such detention violates Americans&#x27; constitutional rights, Levin agreed to include language (to section 1032, later 1021, of the bill) which exempted American citizens from the requirement for military detention. The provision affirming the authority for military detention was modified to specify that it did not affect existing law or authorities relating to the detention of U.S. citizens or lawful resident aliens, but did not specifically exclude them from indefinite detention. Levin quoted the Supreme Court&#x27;s 2004 decision in &quot;Hamdi v. Rumsfeld&quot; in support of his language authorizing indefinite detention.

====National Defense Authorization Act 2015====
The 2015 National Defense Authorization Act was named the Carl Levin and Howard P. &quot;Buck&quot; McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015.

====Levin-Warner Legislative Affairs Suite====
In 2016, the Department of Defense named the office suite of the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs in honor of Levin and Sen. John Warner to honor their bipartisan legislative accomplishments.

====Acquisition====
Levin authored the Competition in Contracting Act, which has led to reductions in federal procurement costs. He played an instrumental role in the enactment of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, which cut red tape out of the federal procurement system and prioritized the purchase of commercial products over government-unique designs. He teamed with Senator John McCain to write the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act, which virtually eliminated cost overruns on major defense purchases for a period of several years after its enactment.

===Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations/Financial Oversight===
For 15 years, from 1999 to 2014, Senator Levin served in leadership positions on the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. During his tenure the senator led investigations into such matters as money laundering, offshore tax abuse, and corporate misconduct.

Highlights from his money laundering investigations included exposing money laundering via Citibank private bank accounts serving the wealthy and corrupt including Mexico&#x27;s Raúl Salinas de Gortari and Gabon&#x27;s late President Omar Bongo; correspondent accounts opened for high-risk offshore banks moving suspect funds; embassy and personal accounts opened for foreign leaders like Chile&#x27;s Augusto Pinochet and Equatorial Guinea&#x27;s dictator Teodoro Obiang; and accounts at a major global bank, HSBC, misused by Mexican drug traffickers, Russian fraudsters, and rogue regimes like Iran.

Levin also led tax investigations that attracted international attention for exposing tax misconduct by wealthy individuals and profitable corporations. Highlights included investigations that exposed abusive tax shelters designed and marketed by accounting firms like KPMG; a 13-year network of 58 offshore trusts and corporations established and used by wealthy Texas brothers, Sam and Charles Wyly, to evade paying their fair share; Swiss banks like UBS and Credit Suisse that helped U.S. tax cheats hide assets; and complex corporate tax schemes that enabled Apple, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, and Caterpillar to avoid paying millions, even billions in taxes.

His inquiries into corporate misconduct were equally famous. Levin&#x27;s highlights here included exposing Enron&#x27;s use of accounting deceptions, financial gimmicks, and executive pay schemes leading to its collapse into bankruptcy; unfair credit card practices that loaded up average U.S. families with debt; JPMorgan Chase&#x27;s $6 billion loss from hidden, reckless derivative trades by the so-called London Whale; and risky investments by the United States&#x27; largest banks to profit from physical commodities like oil, natural gas, aluminum, and electricity at the expense of American businesses and families.

===Education===
Levin was a strong supporter of the creation of the Department of Education. Over the years, Levin introduced legislation and amendments to improve education, including an amendment that greatly reduced class sizes to help teachers better focus on the needs of each specific child. Levin was a hesitant sponsor of the No Child Left Behind Act.

===Energy===
In 2009, Senator Levin directed the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to investigate whether Department of Energy policies caused a rise in the price in crude oil. He also led an investigation in 2001 to try to discover the cause of the spike in gasoline prices that summer.

Levin opposed raising mandatory automobile fuel efficiency standards.

Levin led opposition in the Senate to the Rahall Energy Policy Bill (H.R. 6), but lost 65–27.

===Environment===
On January 22, 2013, Levin introduced the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore Conservation and Recreation Act (S. 23; 113th Congress) into the Senate. The act designated as wilderness about of the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore in the state of Michigan. The newly designated lands and inland waterways comprise the Sleeping Bear Dunes Wilderness, a new component of the National Wilderness Preservation System.

Levin worked to prevent garbage from Canada from being disposed of in Michigan.

In 2011, the Detroit/Wayne County Port Authority (DWCPA), in conjunction with the City of Detroit and MDOT, and through the leadership of Senator Carl M. Levin, opened a 21,000-square-foot public dock and terminal on the riverfront. In 2013, the facility was named the Carl M. Levin Building in honor of the senator&#x27;s efforts to transform the Detroit riverfront.

As co-chair of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force, he fought to protect Michigan&#x27;s signature natural resource. His work included support for Great Lakes harbors, which are vital to Michigan&#x27;s economy and the nation&#x27;s; work to increase funding for Great Lakes environmental restoration; and to preserve the natural, historical, and cultural legacy of the lakes, including historic lighthouses. He played a leading role in helping found the Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary and Keweenaw National Historic Park (National Park Service), and in legislation to preserve Michigan wilderness areas.

===Ethics===
Levin authored the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, which established the first effective disclosure requirements for federal lobbyists and association provisions that significantly tightened the rules governing gifts to Members of Congress from lobbyists and others. Levin was the author of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 which prohibited gifts of honoraria to Members of Congress and significantly limited the use of expensive junkets. He also authored the Whistleblower Protection Act, which protected federal employees who expose wasteful and unnecessary practices.

===Health care===
Senator Levin supported a Patients&#x27; Bill of Rights to reduce the ability of managed care organizations to affect medical decisions.

Levin was an advocate for embryonic stem-cell research because of its potential to cure diseases like Alzheimer&#x27;s, diabetes, and Parkinson&#x27;s.

===Procedure===
Senator Levin was one of only three Democratic senators to dissent from Harry Reid&#x27;s leadership to vote against the nuclear option which switched the Senate away from operating on a supermajority basis, to requiring only a simple majority for certain decisions, on November 21, 2013. Levin supported changing the rules to a simple majority for confirmation votes, but did not support using the nuclear option to do so, saying in his speech on the floor on that day that this &quot;removes an important check on majority overreach&quot; and that he wished to &quot;preserve the rights of the Senate minority&quot;.

===Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act===
Levin initiated the &quot;Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act&quot; against alleged tax havens, for the state of the initiative against tax avoidance and tax evasion registered as S.506, and the complementary initiative H.R.1265.

===Miscellaneous===
Levin was a critic of the New Hampshire presidential primary&#x27;s first-in-the-nation status, saying a more diverse state, such as his own Michigan, should hold its contest first.

In June 1986, along with Paul Simon and John Melcher, Levin was one of three senators to oppose a tax reform bill.

In November 1998, Levin attended a White House reception for National Adoption Month.

In April 2006, Levin was selected by &quot;Time&quot; as one of &quot;America&#x27;s 10 Best Senators&quot;.

The American Civil Liberties Union gave Levin an 84% lifetime rating on civil liberties issues.

A strong gun control advocate, Levin was graded F by Gun Owners of America. He was one of the 16 senators who voted against the Vitter Amendment.

He was almost always seen wearing his glasses at the end of his nose, which drew a bounty of humorous attention. In response, he lightheartedly joked that the late Senator Strom Thurmond (while he was in office) would have never worn his glasses because they &quot;make him look old.&quot; &quot;Daily Show&quot; host Jon Stewart referred to him both as the &quot;kindly old shoemaker&quot;, and &quot;Grandpa Munster&quot;.

An avid supporter of the non-profit civil rights organization , Levin was instrumental in the procurement of equipment and funding for their Machinist Training Institute (MTI).

==Political campaigns==
Levin was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1978. In the Democratic primary, he defeated former U.S. Representative Richard Vander Veen. In the general election, he faced former Senate Minority Whip Robert P. Griffin, whom he defeated 52% to 48%. He won re-election five times before retiring from the Senate.

Levin faced a tough reelection bid in 1984 against former astronaut Jack R. Lousma, winning by only four percent. However, he routed Congressman Bill Schuette in 1990, and was reelected in 1996 and 2002 against only nominal Republican opposition. In 2002, Levin garnered 61% of the vote against Republican Andrew &quot;Rocky&quot; Raczkowski despite the then-high popularity of President George W. Bush and the GOP and a close gubernatorial race that year. In the 2008 election, Levin won by a comfortable margin against state representative Jack Hoogendyk.

<text>The Robert J. Collier Trophy is awarded annually &quot;for the greatest achievement in aeronautics or astronautics in America, with respect to improving the performance, efficiency, and safety of air or space vehicles, the value of which has been thoroughly demonstrated by actual use during the preceding year.&quot;

The Collier Trophy is administered by the National Aeronautic Association (NAA) the oldest national aviation organization in the United States. Founded in 1905, the NAA oversees America&#x27;s oldest and most prestigious aviation and aerospace recognitions. The Collier Trophy is the most coveted of all.

Robert J. Collier, publisher of &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot; magazine, was an air sports pioneer and president of the Aero Club of America. In 1910, he commissioned Baltimore sculptor Ernest Wise Keyser to make the &quot;Aero Club of America Trophy&quot;. First awarded in 1911 to Glenn H. Curtiss for his successful development of the hydro-aeroplane. Collier presented his namesake trophy several times before his death in 1918.

The award is presented once a year by the NAA president, with the trophy on permanent display at the National Air and Space Museum. 

The trophy was stolen briefly in 1978, but was recovered. The thieves left it at Fort Foote park and it was recovered 26 hours from the time it went missing.

==Production==
&quot;Crossing Jordan&quot; was created by Tim Kring and was produced by Tailwind Productions in association with NBCUniversal. Singer-songwriter duo Wendy and Lisa scored the music for the show. Eric Rigler&#x27;s pipes and whistles can be heard in most episodes. The scientific aspects of the show are comparable to &quot;&quot;, but &quot;Crossing Jordan&quot; is more character-driven and less graphic than the CSI franchise.

In the first season, Hennessy was the only cast member visible during the opening credits, which featured Eric Rigler&#x27;s arrangement of a traditional Irish tune &quot;The Boys on the Hilltop&quot; (a quicker tempo, but shorter version of &quot;Reels Part One -- The Boys on the Hilltop&quot; from the Bad Haggis CD &quot;Trip&quot;). Starting with the second season, the credits showed all the major players and used a more rock-like, less-Irish-sounding opening theme.

&quot;Crossing Jordan&quot; is set in the same fictional universe as fellow NBC series &quot;Las Vegas&quot;. In the season-four episode &quot;What Happens in Vegas Dies in Boston&quot;, a case takes Jordan and Woody to Las Vegas, where Woody became very well-acquainted with the Montecito&#x27;s casino host, Sam Marquez (Vanessa Marcil). They maintained a long-distance relationship for a while: O&#x27;Connell appeared in five episodes of &quot;Las Vegas&quot; and Vanessa Marcil appeared as Sam in two &quot;Crossing Jordan&quot; episodes.

==Reception==
&quot;USA Today &quot;gave the show a two-star review and said, &quot;What truly strains belief—and your viewing patience—are the absurd quirks Jordan adds to its plot and its characters to try to set itself apart.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;engaging and entertaining&quot; and &quot;Hennessy gives Jordan an appealing, loose-cannon attitude.&quot;

==Broadcast==
&quot;Crossing Jordan&quot; premiered in 2001 on NBC. It aired on Mondays, Fridays, Sundays and finally Wednesdays for its final episodes.

The show was put on hiatus for most of the 2003–2004 season to accommodate Hennessy&#x27;s real-life pregnancy. The series returned on March 9, 2004, with a shortened 13-episode season. Due to the season being broadcast out of order, the cliffhanger plotline from the season-two finale was aired as the last episode of the season instead of the first; instead, the first featured an unrelated story with a humorous subplot that paid homage to Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s 1954 film &quot;Rear Window&quot;.

A crossover episode of &quot;Las Vegas&quot; in which the &quot;Crossing Jordan&quot; cast appears was aired on November 17, 2006, though NBC was not airing new episodes of &quot;Crossing Jordan&quot; in autumn 2006.

Originally, the sixth season was slated for Sunday nights after the football season ended in January, but it was then scheduled to premiere on October 20, 2006, and to be on Friday nights with &quot;Medium&quot; being put into the after-football Sunday-night slot. It was scheduled to air at 8 pm Eastern/Pacific and 7 pm Central/Mountain, but NBC decided to avoid showing scripted programming at that hour. The season premiere was pre-empted in favor of &quot;1 vs. 100&quot;, a game show hosted by Bob Saget. The season premiere ran on January 14, 2007, at 10 pm Eastern/Pacific and 9 pm Central. Beginning March 7, 2007, the show moved to a new time slot, Wednesday 9/8C where it was promoted as a female empowerment block with &quot;Medium&quot;.

===Syndication===
NBC tried syndicating &quot;Crossing Jordan&quot; during its second season. Reruns are often shown on A&amp;E in the United States and Canada. Currently, it airs in syndication on CIN (Crime and Investigation Network) and Start TV. In January 2021, the Roku Channel in the United States released all episodes of &quot;Crossing Jordan&quot; to stream.

===Cancellation===
Originally, the finale for the sixth season was promoted as a cliffhanger. A plane crash which left all of the main characters (with the exception of Lily) stranded atop a mountain with little hope of being discovered was reported to end with no resolution, as the story would pick up at the onset of a subsequent season. Once NBC decided against renewing &quot;Crossing Jordan&quot; for a seventh year, though, fans were treated to a different ending: Jordan ultimately confronts her held-in feelings for Woody and finally professes her love, and all of the characters are rescued in the final moments of the series. The ending provided fuel to rumors that producers recorded two endings to the finale: one in case the series would be renewed, and another in case the series would not be.

The series was cancelled on May 14, 2007, two days before the season six finale aired.

=== DVD releases ===
NBC announced in January 2007 that it was making progress securing music rights to allow the show to be released on DVD. (&quot;Crossing Jordan&quot; relies heavily on pop music in its soundtrack.) The first season was released on DVD on May 6, 2008, and there is no notice of substitution of music on the DVD packaging. However, as of January 2018, the latter seasons were still not available via DVD in the US. In Germany, the second season was released on DVD and Blu-ray via Koch Media on September 10, 2015. Koch Media already re-released a remastered version of the first season in May 2015.

The complete 27-disc DVD collection is available in Australia from JB HI-FI, EzyDVD, Dymocks., Sanity and Via Vision Entertainment.

<text>The Volvo Sport (also known as P1900) is a Swedish fiberglass-bodied roadster of which sixty-eight units were built, first 19 by Glasspar Company in California, between 1956 and 1957 by Volvo Cars.

Assar Gabrielsson, Volvo&#x27;s president and founder, got the idea for the car when he saw a Chevrolet Corvette in the United States and wanted to make something similar. He asked Bill Tritt of Glasspar, an American boatbuilder in Santa Ana, California, to design and tool a fibreglass/reinforced polyester body, which was later produced in Sweden. Glasspar was a pioneer in building fiberglass auto bodies from 1951 to 1957.

Erik Quistgaard was appointed as development team leader.
The car was built on a tubular-steel chassis and used the Volvo PV444&#x27;s 1414 cc engine producing . The engines (B14A and B16B ) were fitted with twin SU carburetors, driving through a three-speed manual gearbox. Many other parts were taken also from the Volvo PV444.

Demand was low, and the build quality was not up to Volvo standards.&lt;ref name=&quot;volvoadventures.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Gunnar Engellau, who replaced Gabrielsson as president in 1956, took one for a drive on a holiday weekend and was dissatisfied enough that on returning to his office the following week cancelled the remaining production. &quot;I thought it would fall apart!&quot; is the legendary quote. The Volvo chassis design was far too flexible to accommodate a fiberglass body, and that Volvo resisted recommendations by Glasspar to alter the frame to address their concerns.

The total &quot;Volvo Sport&quot; production was sixty-eight cars, plus four or five prototypes. Forty-four were built in 1956, mostly for the Swedish market, and most still survive. The bulk of 1957&#x27;s production went to the U.S. and elsewhere, and fewer of these are still in existence.

The development of the P1900 led to the tuning of the B-16 engine however, which was later put into the PV 444 series, making this car powerful enough to enter the US market.

<doc id="335864" wikidata="Q2596062" url="?curid=335864" title="Restriction modification system">
<text>The restriction modification system (RM system) is found in bacteria and archaea, and provides a defense against foreign DNA, such as that borne by bacteriophages.

Bacteria have restriction enzymes, also called restriction endonucleases, which cleave double-stranded DNA at specific points into fragments, which are then degraded further by other endonucleases. This prevents infection by effectively destroying the foreign DNA introduced by an infectious agent (such as a bacteriophage). Approximately one-quarter of known bacteria possess RM systems and of those about one-half have more than one type of system.

As the sequences recognized by the restriction enzymes are very short, the bacterium itself will almost certainly contain some within its genome. In order to prevent destruction of its own DNA by the restriction enzymes, methyl groups are added. These modifications must not interfere with the DNA base-pairing, and therefore, usually only a few specific bases are modified on each strand.

Endonucleases cleave internal/non-terminal phosphodiester bonds. They do so only after recognising specific sequences in DNA which are usually 4–6 base pairs long, and often palindromic.

==History==
The RM system was first discovered by Salvatore Luria and Mary Human in 1952 and 1953. They found that a bacteriophage growing within an infected bacterium could be modified, so that upon their release and re-infection of a related bacterium the bacteriophage&#x27;s growth is restricted (inhibited; also described by Luria in his autobiography on pages 45 and 99 in 1984). In 1953, Jean Weigle and Giuseppe Bertani reported similar examples of host-controlled modification using different bacteriophage system. Later work by Daisy Roulland-Dussoix and Werner Arber in 1962 and many other subsequent workers led to the understanding that restriction was due to attack and breakdown of the modified bacteriophage&#x27;s DNA by specific enzymes of the recipient bacteria. Further work by Hamilton O. Smith isolated &quot;Hin&quot;DII, the first of the class of enzymes now known as restriction enzymes, while Daniel Nathans showed that it can be used for restriction mapping. When these enzymes were isolated in the laboratory they could be used for controlled manipulation of DNA, thus providing the foundation for the development of genetic engineering. Werner Arber, Daniel Nathans, and Hamilton Smith were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1978 for their work on restriction-modification.

==Types==

There are four categories of restriction modification systems: type I, type II, type III and type IV. All have restriction enzyme activity and a methylase activity (except for type IV that has no methylase activity). They were named in the order of discovery, although the type II system is the most common.

Type I systems are the most complex, consisting of three polypeptides: R (restriction), M (modification), and S (specificity). The resulting complex can both cleave and methylate DNA. Both reactions require ATP, and cleavage often occurs a considerable distance from the recognition site. The S subunit determines the specificity of both restriction and methylation. Cleavage occurs at variable distances from the recognition sequence, so discrete bands are not easily visualized by gel electrophoresis.

Type II systems are the simplest and the most prevalent. Instead of working as a complex, the methyltransferase and endonuclease are encoded as two separate proteins and act independently (there is no specificity protein). Both proteins recognize the same recognition site, and therefore compete for activity. The methyltransferase acts as a monomer, methylating the duplex one strand at a time. The endonuclease acts as a homodimer, which facilitates the cleavage of both strands. Cleavage occurs at a defined position close to or within the recognition sequence, thus producing discrete fragments during gel electrophoresis. For this reason, Type II systems are used in labs for DNA analysis and gene cloning.

Type III systems have R (res) and M (mod) proteins that form a complex of modification and cleavage. The M protein, however, can methylate on its own. Methylation also only occurs on one strand of the DNA unlike most other known mechanisms. The heterodimer formed by the R and M proteins competes with itself by modifying and restricting the same reaction. This results in incomplete digestion.

Type IV systems are not true RM systems because they only contain a restriction enzyme and not a methylase. Unlike the other types, type IV restriction enzymes recognize and cut only modified DNA.

==Function==

&quot;Neisseria meningitidis&quot; has multiple type II restriction endonuclease systems that are employed in natural genetic transformation. Natural genetic transformation is a process by which a recipient bacterial cell can take up DNA from a neighboring donor bacterial cell and integrate this DNA into its genome by recombination. Although early work on restriction modification systems focused on the benefit to bacteria of protecting themselves against invading bacteriophage DNA or other foreign DNA, it is now known that these systems can also be used to restrict DNA introduced by natural transformation from other members of the same, or related species.

In the pathogenic bacterium &quot;Neisseria meningitidis&quot; (meningococci), competence for transformation is a highly evolved and complex process where multiple proteins at the bacterial surface, in the membranes and in the cytoplasm interact with the incoming transforming DNA. Restriction-modification systems are abundant in the genus &quot;Neisseria&quot;. &quot;N. meningitidis&quot; has multiple type II restriction endonuclease systems. The restriction modification systems in &quot;N. meningitidis&quot; vary in specificity between different clades. This specificity provides an efficient barrier against DNA exchange between clades. Luria, on page 99 of his autobiography, referred to such a restriction behavior as &quot;an extreme instance of unfriendliness.&quot; Restriction-modification appears to be a major driver of sexual isolation and speciation in the meningococci. Caugant and Maiden suggested that restriction-modification systems in meningococci may act to allow genetic exchange among very close relatives while reducing (but not completely preventing) genetic exchange among meningococci belonging to different clonal complexes and related species.

RM systems can also act as selfish genetic elements, forcing their maintenance on the cell through postsegregational cell killing.

Some viruses have evolved ways of subverting the restriction modification system, usually by modifying their own DNA, by adding methyl or glycosyl groups to it, thus blocking the restriction enzymes. Other viruses, such as bacteriophages T3 and T7, encode proteins that inhibit the restriction enzymes.

To counteract these viruses, some bacteria have evolved restriction systems which only recognize and cleave modified DNA, but do not act upon the host&#x27;s unmodified DNA. Some prokaryotes have developed multiple types of restriction modification systems.

R-M systems are more abundant in promiscuous species, wherein they establish preferential paths of genetic exchange within and between lineages with cognate R-M systems. Because the repertoire and/or specificity of R-M systems in bacterial lineages vary quickly, the preferential fluxes of genetic transfer within species are expected to constantly change, producing time-dependent networks of gene transfer.

==Applications==

===Molecular biology===

(a) Cloning: RM systems can be cloned into plasmids and selected because of the resistance provided by the methylation enzyme. Once the plasmid begins to replicate, the methylation enzyme will be produced and methylate the plasmid DNA, protecting it from a specific restriction enzyme.

(b) Restriction fragment length polymorphisms: Restriction enzymes are also used to analyse the composition of DNA in regard to presence or absence of mutations that affect the REase cleavage specificity. When wild-type and mutants are analysed by digestion with different REases, the gel-electrophoretic products vary in length, largely because mutant genes will not be cleaved in a similar pattern as wild-type for presence of mutations that render the REases non-specific to the mutant sequence.

The bacteria R-M system has been proposed as a model for devising human anti-viral gene or genomic vaccines and therapies since the RM system serves an innate defense-role in bacteria by restricting tropism of bacteriophages. Research is on REases and ZFN that can cleave the DNA of various human viruses, including HSV-2, high-risk HPVs and HIV-1, with the ultimate goal of inducing target mutagenesis and aberrations of human-infecting viruses. The human genome already contains remnants of retroviral genomes that have been inactivated and harnessed for self-gain. Indeed, the mechanisms for silencing active L1 genomic retroelements by the three prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1) and excision repair cross complementing 1 (ERCC) appear to mimic the action of RM-systems in bacteria, and the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) that follows the use of ZFN without a repair template.

A major advance is the creation of artificial restriction enzymes created by linking the FokI DNA cleavage domain with an array of DNA binding proteins or zinc finger arrays, denoted now as zinc finger nucleases (ZFN). ZFNs are a powerful tool for host genome editing due to their enhanced sequence specificity. ZFN work in pairs, their dimerization being mediated in-situ through the FoKI domain. Each zinc finger array (ZFA) is capable of recognizing 9–12 base-pairs, making for 18–24 for the pair. A 5–7 bp spacer between the cleavage sites further enhances the specificity of ZFN, making them a safe and more precise tool that can be applied in humans. A recent Phase I clinical trial of ZFN for the targeted abolition of the CCR5 co-receptor for HIV-1 has been undertaken.

== Relation with mobile genetic elements ==
R-M systems are major players in the co-evolutionary interaction between mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and their hosts. Genes encoding R-M systems have been reported to move between prokaryotic genomes within MGEs such as plasmids, prophages, insertion sequences/transposons, integrative conjugative elements (ICEs) and integrons. However, it was recently found that there are relatively few R-M systems in plasmids, some in prophages, and practically none in phages. On the other hand, all these MGEs encode a large number of solitary R-M genes, notably MTases. In light of this, it is likely that R-M mobility may be less dependent on MGEs and more dependent, for example, on the existence of small genomic integration hotspots. It is also possible that R-M systems frequently exploit other mechanisms such as natural transformation, vesicles, nanotubes, gene transfer agents or generalized transduction in order to move between genomes.

<text>The Metropolitan Archdiocese of Baltimore () is the archdiocese of the Latin Church of the Catholic Church in northern and western Maryland in the United States. It is the metropolitan see of the Ecclesiastical Province of Baltimore.

The Archdiocese of Baltimore is the oldest archdiocese in the United States. Soon after the American Revolution, the diocese was erected to cover the United States, before the establishment of additional dioceses. The Vatican granted the archbishop of Baltimore the right of precedence in the nation at liturgies, meetings, and Plenary Councils in 1859. It is the premier episcopal see of the Catholic Church in the United States of America, as &quot;prerogative of place&quot;.

As of 2020, the archdiocese had an estimated Catholic population of 525,000 with 198 diocesan priests, 193 religious priests and 169 permanent deacons in 139 parishes.

The Archdiocese of Baltimore has two major seminaries: St. Mary&#x27;s Seminary and University in Baltimore and Mount St. Mary&#x27;s Seminary in Emmitsburg.

It was revealed in late 2016 that the Archdiocese of Baltimore had paid off numerous settlements since 2011 for abuse victims.

== Territory ==
The Archdiocese of Baltimore comprises the City of Baltimore and nine Maryland counties: Allegany, Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Carroll, Frederick, Garrett–Harford, Howard, and Washington.

==History==

=== 1600 to 1700 ===

The first Catholic presence in the original British colonies in America was the proprietary colony of Maryland, established by Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore in 1634. A Catholic himself, Calvert intended the colony to be open to English Catholics facing persecution at home.

In 1689, members of the growing Puritan population in Maryland staged a takeover of the colonial government and effectively outlawed Catholicism. In 1691, alarmed at the violent conflicts in Maryland, the British Crown took over the colony from the Calvert family.

=== 1700 to 1789 ===
The new royal governor in Maryland imposed less sweeping restrictions on Catholics than those of the Puritan regime. These restrictions would stay in place until after the end of the American Revolution.

During the British colonial period, the small Catholic communities in the American colonies were under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Apostolic Vicariate of the London District in England. The first Catholic church in Baltimore, St. Peter&#x27;s, was dedicated in 1770.

In November 1783, after the end of the Revolution, the Catholic clergy in Maryland petitioned the Vatican for permission to nominate a priest as superior of the missions for the United States. The superior would have some of the powers of a bishop and be in charge of the American Catholic Church. After receiving papal approval, the clergy nominated Reverend John Carroll to become superior. Pope Pius VI in June 1784 confirmed Carroll as superior of the missions. This papal act established an American hierarchy, removing the American Catholic Church from the authority of the British Catholic Church

In November 1784, Pius VI erected the Prefecture Apostolic of the United States encompassing the entire country. Since Maryland had the largest Catholic population, Pope Pius VI placed the prefecture see in Baltimore and appointed Carroll as its first prefect apostolic.

=== 1789 to 1800 ===

Four years later, Pius VI elevated the prefecture into the Diocese of Baltimore, making it the first diocese solely within the United States. St. Peter&#x27;s, the only Catholic church in Baltimore, was designated as the pro-cathedral (temporary cathedral). The new Diocese of Baltimore covered the entire nation.

To train priests for his new diocese, Carroll asked the Fathers of the Company of Saint Sulpice to come to Baltimore. They arrived in 1791 and started the nucleus of St. Mary&#x27;s College and Seminary in that city. Also in 1791, Carroll convened the first diocesan synod in the United States. Twenty-two priests attended the synod, setting national policies for baptism, confirmation, penance, the celebration of the liturgy in the mass, anointing of the sick, and mixed marriages.

The Vatican in 1795 appointed Reverend Leonard Neale as coadjutor bishop in Baltimore to assist Carroll. In 1798, Carroll won a civil case in Pennsylvania that acknowledged his position as leader of the American church. Carroll gave his approval to the founding of the Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary, who in 1799 established Visitation Academy in Georgetown.

=== 1800 to 1821 ===

Carroll ordained the first American-born Catholic priest, Reverend William Matthews, at St. Peter&#x27;s Pro-Cathedral in Baltimore in 1800. In 1806, Carroll started construction of the Cathedral of the Assumption in Baltimore As the Catholic population of the United States grew, the Vatican saw the need to create more dioceses. In 1808, Pope Pius VII erected four new dioceses from what now became the Archdiocese of Baltimore. The pope named Carroll as the first archbishop of Baltimore.

After Carroll died in 1815, Neale automatically succeeded him as archbishop of Baltimore. However, due to Neale&#x27;s bad health, Pope Pius VII in 1816 appointed Reverend Ambrose Maréchal as coadjutor archbishop. When Neale died in 1817, Maréchal succeeded him as archbishop of Baltimore.

Maréchal believed that his most pressing problem was a shortage of priests. It was aggravated by parish trustees who thought they had the power to assign these priests. In some Irish parishes, the trustees would demand Irish priests, even if they were not qualified. In 1820, Bishop Flaget of Bardstown warned Maréchal about a man claiming to be a priest who wanted to practice in the archdiocese. This individual produced positive letters of introduction from his bishop. However, when he was observed celebrating mass, it became clear that the so-called priest was incompetent. Maréchal later advised the Propaganda Fide (now the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples) in Rome about this problem.

=== 1821 to 1850 ===

Maréchal dedicated the completed Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary Cathedral in May 1821. Later in 1821, Maréchal went to Rome on archdiocese business. One problem he had faced in Maryland was the disputed ownership of the White Marsh plantation in Bowie. The Order of Jesus had received the plantation as a gift in 1728 and claimed it as their property. Maréchal said that the plantation actually belonged to the archdiocese. The Vatican gave the archdiocese ownership of White Marsh.

On January 8, 1828, Reverend James Whitfield of Baltimore was appointed coadjutor archbishop of the archdiocese by Pope Leo XII. Before Whitfield could be consecrated as coadjutor, Maréchal died on January 29, 1828. Whitfield was finally consecrated as archbishop in June 1828. He convened a synod for the diocesan clergy in 1831 and the Second Provincial Council of Baltimore in 1833. Throughout his tenure, Whitfield worked for the welfare of the African American community. He authorized the foundation of the Oblate Sisters of Providence, the first religious order of African-American women in the United States. Whitfield talked about how he would have liked to evangelize the hundreds of thousands of enslaved African-Americans in Virginia.

Pope Gregory XVI in March 1834 appointed Reverend Samuel Eccleston as coadjutor archbishop to assist Whitfield. When Whitfield died in October 1834, Eccleston automatically succeeded him as archbishop. Eccleston encouraged religious orders to establish mother houses in his diocese, particularly those orders that could provide social services to the growing number of Catholic immigrants in the industrializing cities. The Sisters of the Visitation increased the number of their academies in the city and the archdiocese, the Brothers of St. Patrick opened a trade school near Baltimore, and the Redemptorists provided services for German-speaking immigrants. The Brothers of the Christian Schools founded Calvert Hall School in 1845 in Baltimore.

In 1847, Eccleston was planning to disband the Oblate Sisters of Providence, but was dissuaded by Redemptorist Father Thaddeus Anwander. St. Charles College was established in 1848 in Howard County on land donated by the planter Charles Carroll. Between 1837 and 1849, Eccleston held five provincial councils in Baltimore. He also started several new parishes during his administration. Eccleston died in 1851.

=== 1850 to 1866 ===
The Vatican continued to erect new dioceses and vicariates out of the Archdiocese of Baltimore through the 19th century as the church evolved and grew in the United States.

Following the death of Eccleston, Bishop Francis Kenrick of Philadelphia was named the sixth archbishop of Baltimore by Pope Pius IX in 1851. He presided over the First Plenary Council of Baltimore in 1852. As archbishop, Kenrick expanded parochial schools throughout the archdiocese. Under his tenure, parochial schools were free for all students, and were supported directly by the parishes. Kenrick died in 1863. The next archbishop of Baltimore was Bishop Martin Spalding from the Diocese of Louisville, appointed by Pope Pius IX.

=== 1866 to 1900 ===

In 1866, Spalding founded St. Mary&#x27;s Industrial School in Baltimore, a boys reformatory. Spalding conducted a visitation of the archdiocese, during which he reportedly administered confirmation to 8,000 people. Spalding recruited priests for the archdiocese from All Hallows College in Ireland and the American College at Louvain in Belgium He also organized the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul as well as the Association of St. Joseph, a society for the care of impoverished girls.

After the end of the American Civil War in 1865, Spalding raised $10,000 in the archdiocese for relief efforts in the former Confederate States of America. He also took a special interest in the spiritual welfare of the African-Americans who had just been freed from slavery. Writing to Archbishop John McCloskey, Spalding said, &quot;Four million of these unfortunates are thrown on our charity, and they silently but eloquently appeal to us for help.&quot; He invited Reverend Herbert Vaughan and the Mill Hill Fathers from England to minister exclusively among freedmen. In October 1866, Spalding presided over the Second Plenary Council of Baltimore.

After Spalding died in 1871, Pius IX appointed bishop James Bayley from the Diocese of Newark as the next archbishop of Baltimore in 1872. He convened the Eighth Provincial Synod in 1875 and enacted new regulations on clerical dress, mixed marriages, and church music. Bayley consecrated the cathedral in 1876 and retired a large amount of archdiocesan debt. In May 1877, Pius IX selected Bishop James Gibbons of Richmond as coadjutor archbishop to assist the sick Bayley. After Bayley died in October 1877, Gibbons succeeded him as archbishop of Baltimore. In 1884, Gibbons founded the House of the Good Shepherd in Baltimore, a reformatory for female criminals.

=== 1900 to 1940 ===

After the end of World War I in 1919, Gibbons supported American participation in the new League of Nations. He was initially opposed to the women&#x27;s suffrage movement in the United States. However, when the nineteenth amendment to the US Constitution passed in 1920, allowing women to vote, Gibbons urged women to exercise that right, describing it &quot;...not only as a right but as a strict social duty.&quot; Gibbons died in 1921

Bishop Michael Curley of the Diocese of Saint Augustine was the next archbishop of Baltimore, named by Pope Benedict XV in 1921. His arrival in his new city was described in the press as &quot;one of the greatest welcomes ever tendered a new citizen of Baltimore.&quot; During his tenure in Baltimore, Curley established 66 schools, placing the importance of constructing schools over churches. In 1926, he declared, &quot;I defy any system of grammar school education in the United States to prove itself superior to the system that is being maintained in the Archdiocese of Baltimore.&quot; He also established diocesan offices for Catholic Charities in 1923 and for the Society for the Propagation of the Faith in 1925.

In 1939, Pope Pius XII erected the Archdiocese of Washington, taking the District of Columbia and five nearby Maryland counties from the Archdiocese of Baltimore. The pope selected Curley to serve as archbishop of Washington. The two archdioceses now shared the same archbishop. Curley used the title of Archbishop of Baltimore-Washington during this period, although the two archdioceses were separate entities.

=== 1940 to 1989 ===

After Curley died in 1947, Pius XII appointed Monsignor Patrick A. O&#x27;Boyle as archbishop of Washington and Bishop Francis Keough of the Diocese of Providence as archbishop of Baltimore. During the 14 years of Keough&#x27;s administration, the Catholic population of the archdiocese grew from 265,000 to 400,000. Keough dedicated the new Cathedral of Mary Our Queen in Baltimore in 1959; he also built many new schools, homes, and orphanages.

In July 1961, Pope John XXIII named Bishop Lawrence Shehan of the Diocese of Bridgeport to assist Keough as coadjutor archbishop. When Keough died in December 1961, Shehan automatically succeeded him as archbishop of Baltimore. Shehan was a strong supporter of the American Civil Rights movement. He banned racial segregation in all of the archdiocesan institutions in 1962 and participated in the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. Shehan also maintained good relations with the Jewish and Eastern Orthodox communities in the archdiocese. Shehan worked with his friend Harry Lee Doll, Episcopal Bishop of Maryland, on both civil rights and ecumenical issues. Along with the president of St. Mary&#x27;s Seminary and University, Shehan and Doll in 1968 founded the Ecumenical Institute at St. Mary&#x27;s.

Following Shehan&#x27;s retirement in 1974, Pope Paul VI named Bishop William Borders of the Diocese of Orlando as the 13th archbishop of Baltimore that same year.

During his 15-year tenure in Baltimore, Borders divided the archdiocese into three vicariates and appointed his auxiliary bishops as vicars over them. He reorganized the Archdiocesan Central Services, naming cabinet-level secretaries to carry out the administrative work of the archdiocese. Borders clarified and strengthened the role of the archdiocesan pastoral council, and combined the board of consultors and the priests senate to form the priests&#x27; council. He initiated a Department of Pastoral Planning and Management, an Office of Fund Development and an evangelization effort. Instead of residing at an apartment at the Basilica of the Assumption, Borders lived alone at the former sexton&#x27;s lodge. Borders became what &quot;Baltimore Magazine&quot; called the &quot;king of the soup kitchens&quot;. While he was archbishop, the budget for Catholic Charities grew from $2.5 million a year to $33 million a year, and its staff expanded from 200 to over 1,000. Borders retired in 1989.

=== 1989 to present ===

Pope John Paul II appointed Bishop William H. Keeler from the Diocese of Harrisburg as the next archbishop of Baltimore in 1989. Keeler was responsible for the restoration of the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary.

After Keeler retired in 2006, John Paul II replaced him with Archbishop Edwin O&#x27;Brien from the Archdiocese for the Military Services, USA. In 2008, O&#x27;Brien dedicated the Pope John Paul II Prayer Garden in Baltimore, which he called a &quot;sanctuary in a suffering city.&quot; In 2011, he became grand master of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem in Rome.

In 2012, Bishop William E. Lori of Bridgeport was appointed archbishop of Baltimore by Pope Benedict XVI. In 2019, Lori released “&quot;The Journey to Racial Justice: Repentance, Healing and Action.&quot;” The document acknowledged racism in the Catholic Church and suggested measures to combat it. That same year, Lori instituted an initiative for reporting allegations against any bishop in the archdiocese. The policy was drafted by the archdiocesan independent review board.

As of 2023, Lori is the current archbishop of Baltimore.

=== Plenary councils of Baltimore ===

The Plenary Councils of Baltimore were three national meetings of American Catholic bishops in the 19th century.
* First Plenary Council (1852) – The First Council published a decree requiring priests immigrating to the United States to provide letters of reference from their previous bishops before they could practise ministry in this country. The council also passed a requirement that Catholic engaged couples publish marriage banns.
* Second Plenary Council (1866) – The Second Council advocated the churching of women, a ceremony blessing women after childbirth, and setting age 10 as the age for first communion. 
* Third Plenary Council (1884) – The Third Council set six holy days of obligation for Catholics and appointed a commission to draft a catechism.

===Sexual abuse ===
In July 1995, John Merzbacher, a teacher at Catholic Community Middle School in south Baltimore, received four life sentences after being convicted of raping Elizabeth Ann Murphy at the school in the 1970s. At the time, prosecutors also found evidence that Marzbacher sexually abused 13 other male and female students when he taught there. Merzbacher died in prison in May 2023.

In 2016, the archdiocese confirmed that it had paid a total of $472,000 to settlements to 16 former students of Archbishop Keough High School. The plaintiffs claimed to have been sexually abused as children by Reverend A. Joseph Maskell from 1967 to 1975. After the archdiocese removed Maskell from ministry in 1994, he fled to Ireland. He was never charged with any crimes.&quot;

The archdiocese was featured in the 2017 Netflix documentary &quot;The Keepers,&quot; investigated sexual abuse by clergy at Archbishop Keough High School and the murder of Sister Catherine Cesnik in 1969.

A report released by Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro in August 2018, singled out Cardinal William Keeler for criticism. When Keeler was archbishop of Baltimore, he allowed Reverend Arthur Long to transfer from the Diocese of Harrisburg to the Archdiocese of Baltimore. Long had been accused of sexually abusing children during his time in Harrisburg when Keeler was bishop there . After the grand jury report was released, the archdiocese canceled plans to named a new elementary school after Keeler.

In February 2019, Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh launched an investigation into sexual abuse allegations against the archdiocese. Archbishop Lori provided Frosh with over 50,000 pages of internal documents dating back to 1965.

In March 2019, Lori banned former Auxiliary Bishop Gordon Bennett, then residing in the archdiocese, from practicing any form of ministry in the archdiocese or the suffragan Diocese of Wheeling–Charleston. Bennett had been accused of sexual abuse in 2006. In April 2019, the archdiocese added the names of 23 deceased clergy to a list of accused clergy which the archdiocese published in 2002. Long, a Jesuit, was among those added to the list.

The State of Maryland investigation concluded in November 2022, and its report was released in April 2023. The report named 156 archdiocesan employees and clergy as having credible accusations of sexually abusing more that 600 children between 1940 and 2002. At the same time as the release of the report, the Maryland General Assembly passed a bill to end a statute of limitations on abuse-related civil lawsuits. This bill was signed into law by Governor Wes Moore in April 2023.

On September 29, 2023, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore in the US filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy to evade large anticipated financial losses in upcoming lawsuits permitted by the Maryland Child Victims Act starting on October 1.

==Episcopate==
===Prerogative of place===
In 1858, the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith (&quot;Propaganda Fide&quot;), with the approval of Pius IX, conferred &quot;Prerogative of Place&quot; on the Archdiocese of Baltimore. This decree gave the archbishop of Baltimore precedence over all other American archbishops in councils, gatherings, and meetings. It did not matter if another archbishop had been elevated sooner or had been serving long. However, a cardinal still had precedence over the archbishop of Baltimore.

===Cathedrals===
The first cathedral for the archdiocese was St. Peter&#x27;s Pro-Cathedral, which is no longer standing. Today, like only a few other archdioceses in the United States, the Archdiocese of Baltimore has two cathedrals, both in Baltimore: the Cathedral of Mary Our Queen and the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The archbishop is considered the pastor of both co-cathedrals, appointing rectors to operate them.

==== St. Peter&#x27;s Pro-Cathedral ====
St. Peters served as the base for the archbishop of Baltimore from 1790 to 1821. Since it never met the physical criteria for a proper cathedral and was always considered temporary, St. Peter&#x27;s was termed a pro-cathedral. The building was razed in 1841.

==== Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary ====
Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary was constructed between 1806 and 1821. It was the first cathedral in the newly independent United States and is considered the mother church of the country. It is a co-cathedral of the archdiocese.

==== Cathedral of Mary Our Queen ====
Mary Our Queen was started in 1954 and completed in 1959. It is a co-cathedral of the archdiocese.

A year later, she opened the first free Catholic school for girls in the United States. In 1975, Seton became the first American-born person to be canonized a saint.
* Mother Mary Lange - Lange opened a free school in her Baltimore home for African American children who were denied access to other schools in the city. In 1828, Lange founded the Oblate Sisters of Providence, the first sustained religious order for African American women in the United States. She also opened what would later become St. Frances Academy, the first Catholic School for African-American children in the United States. In 1991, the Catholic Church opened a cause of sainthood for Lange, naming her a &quot;servant of God.&quot;

The archdiocese began to publish its diocesan newspaper, &quot;The Baltimore Catholic Review&quot; in 1913 as the successor to the earlier diocesan publication &quot;The Catholic Mirror&quot;, published 1833 to 1908. The name has since been shortened to &quot;The Catholic Review&quot;. It changed from weekly to biweekly publication in 2012 and transformed again to a monthly magazine in December 2015.

==Ecclesiastical province==
When the Archdiocese of Baltimore was erected in 1808, its ecclesiastical province covered the entire nation. In 1847, with the erected of the Archdiocese of St. Louis, the ecclesiastical province of Baltimore shrank.

<text>The Lingayats are a monotheistic religious denomination of Shaivism within Hinduism. Lingayats are also known as , , , . Lingayats are known for their unique practice of Ishtalinga worship, where adherents carry a personal linga symbolizing a constant, intimate relationship with Parashiva. A radical feature of lingayats is their staunch opposition to the caste system and advocacy for social equality, challenging societal norms of the time. Its philosophical tenets are encapsulated in Vachanas, a form of devotional poetry. The tradition also emphasizes Kayaka (work) and Dasoha (service) as forms of worship, underscoring the sanctity of labor and service to others. Unlike mainstream Hinduism, Lingayats reject scriptural authority of vedas, puranas, superstition, astrology, vedic priesthood ritualistic practices, and the concept of rebirth, promoting a direct, personal experience of the divine.

Lingayats are considered as a Shaiva tradition or Sampradaya (sect). because their beliefs include many Hindu elements. Worship is centered on Shiva as the universal god in the iconographic form of &quot;Ishtalinga&quot;. Lingayats emphasize qualified monism, with philosophical foundations similar to those of Ramanuja.

Contemporary Lingayats are influential in South India, especially in the state of Karnataka. Lingayats celebrate anniversaries (&quot;jayanti&quot;) of major religious leaders of their sect, as well as Hindu festivals such as Shivaratri and Ganesh Chaturthi. Lingayats have their own pilgrimage places, temples, shrines and religious poetry based on Shiva. Today, Lingayats, along with Shaiva Siddhanta followers, Naths, Pashupatas, Kapalikas and others constitute the Shaivite population.

==Etymology==
The word &#x27;Lingayat&#x27; is derived from the Sanskrit root &quot;lingam&quot; &quot;mark, symbol&quot; and the suffix &quot;ayta&quot;. The adherents of ishtalinga are known as &quot;Lingayats&quot;. In historical literature, they are sometimes referred to as Lingawants, Lingangis, Lingadharis, Sivabhaktas, Virasaivas or Veerashaivas. The term Lingayat is based on the practice of both genders of Lingayats wearing an contained inside a silver box with a necklace all the time. The is an oval-shaped emblem symbolising Parashiva, the absolute reality and icon of their spirituality.

Historically, Lingayats were known as &quot;Virashaivas&quot; or &quot;ardent, heroic worshippers of Shiva.&quot; According to Blake Michael, Veerashaivism refers both to a &quot;philosophical or theological system as well as to the historical, social and religious movement which originated from that system.&quot; Lingayats refer to the modern adherents of this religion. The term Lingayats came to be commonly used during the British colonial period.

The terms &quot;Lingayat&quot; and &quot;Veerashaiva&quot; have been used synonymously. &quot;Veerashaivism&quot; refers to the broader &quot;Veerashaiva&quot; philosophy and theology as well as the movement, states Blake Michael, while Lingayata refers to the modern community, sect or caste that adheres to this philosophy. In the contemporary era, some state that Veerashaiva is a (sub)tradition within Lingayats with Vedic influences, and these sources have been seeking a political recognition of Lingayats to be separate from Veerashaivas, and Lingayats to be a separate religious community. In contrast, Veerashaivas consider the two contemporary (sub)traditions to be &quot;one and the same community&quot; belonging to Hinduism.

==Origin==
The origins of Lingayats is traced to the 11th- and 12th-century CE in a region that includes northern Karnataka and nearby districts of South India. This region was a stronghold of Jainism and Shaivism. According to Iyer and other scholars, the Lingayat theology emerged as a definitive egalitarian movement in this theological milieu, growing rapidly beyond north Karnataka. The Lingayats, states Burjor Avari quoting Jha, were &quot;extremely anti-Jain&quot;. The Veerashaiva philosophy enabled Lingayats to &quot;win over the Jains to Shiva worship&quot;. The Lingayats were also anti-Brahmin as evidenced by the polemics against the Brahmins in early Veerashaiva literature.

According to a tradition which developed after Basava&#x27;s time, &quot;Veerashaivism&quot; was transmitted by five &quot;Panchacharyas&quot;, namely Renukacharya, Darukacharya, Ekorama, Panditharadhya, and Vishweswara, and first taught by Renukacharya to sage Agasthya, a Vedic seer. A central text in this tradition is Siddhanta Shikhamani, which was written in Sanskrit, and gives an elaboration of &quot;the primitive traits of Veerashaivism [found] in the Vedas and the Upanishads&quot; and &quot;the concrete features given to it in the latter parts (Uttarabhaga) of the Saivagamas.&quot; While Veerashaivas regard the &quot;Siddhanta Shikhamani&quot; to predate Basava, it may actually have been composed in the 13th or 14th century, post-dating Basava.

==History==

===Basava (12th century)===

The Sharana-movement, which started in the 11th century, is regarded by some as the start of Veerashaivism. It started in a time when Kalamukha Shaivism, which was supported by the ruling classes, was dominant, and in control of the monasteries. The Sharana-movement was inspired by the Nayanars, and emphasised personal religious experience over text-based dogmatism.

The traditional legends and hagiographic texts state that Basava was the founder of the Lingayats and its secular practices. Basava was a 12th-century Hindu philosopher, statesman, Kannada poet in the Shiva-focused Bhakti movement and a social reformer during the reign of the Kalachuri king Bijjala II (reigned 1157–1167) in Karnataka, India.

Basava grew up in a Brahmin family with a tradition of Shaivism. As a leader, he developed and inspired a new devotional movement named &quot;Virashaivas&quot;, or &quot;ardent, heroic worshippers of Shiva&quot;. This movement shared its roots in the ongoing Bhakti movement, particularly the Shaiva Nayanars traditions, over the 7th- to 11th-century. However, Basava championed devotional worship that rejected temple worship with rituals led by Brahmins, and emphasized personalised direct worship of Shiva through practices such as individually worn icons and symbols like a small linga.

Basavanna spread social awareness through his poetry, popularly known as &quot;Vachanaas&quot;. Basavanna rejected gender or social discrimination, and caste distinctions, as well as some extant practices such as the wearing of sacred thread, and replaced this with the ritual of wearing &quot;Ishtalinga&quot; necklace, with an image of the Shiva Liṅga, by every person regardless of his or her birth, to be a constant reminder of one&#x27;s bhakti (loving devotion) to god Shiva. As the chief minister of his kingdom, he introduced new public institutions such as the &quot;Anubhava Mantapa&quot; (or, the &quot;hall of spiritual experience&quot;), which welcomed men and women from all socio-economic backgrounds to discuss spiritual and mundane questions of life, in open.

After initially supporting Basava, king Bijjala II disagreed with Basava&#x27;s rejection of caste distinctions. In 1167 the Veerashaivas were repressed, and most of them left Kalyāna, Bijjala&#x27;s new capital, spreading Basava&#x27;s teachings into a wider area in southern India. The king was assassinated by the Veerashaivas in 1168.

===Consolidation (12th–14th century)===
After Basava&#x27;s death, Shaivism consolidated its influence in southern India, meanwhile adjusting to Hindu orthodoxy. Basava&#x27;s nephew Channabasava organised the community and systematised Virasaiva theology, moving the Virashaiva community toward the mainstream Hindu culture. Basava&#x27;s role in the origins of Shaivism was downplayed, and a mythology developed in which the origins of Veerashaivism were attributed to the five Panchacharyas, descending to earth in the different world-ages to teach Shaivism. In this narrative, Basava was regarded as a reviver of this ancient teaching.

Monasteries of the older Saiva schools, &quot;such as the Kalamukha,&quot; were taken over by the Virasaivas. Two kinds of monastic orders developed. Due to their roots in the traditional schools, the &quot;gurusthalada&quot; monasteries were more conservative, while the &quot;viraktas&quot; &quot;constituted the true Virasaiva monastic organisation, shaped by the ideals of Basava and his contemporaries.&quot;

===Vijayanagara Empire (15th–17th century)===
In the 14th-15th century, a Lingayat revival took place in northern Karnataka in the Vijayanagara Empire. The Lingayats likely were a part of the reason why Vijayanagara succeeded in territorial expansion and in withstanding the Deccan Sultanate wars. The Lingayat text &quot;Sunyasampadane&quot; grew out of the scholarly discussions in an Anubhava Mantapa, and according to Bill Aitken, these were &quot;compiled at the Vijayanagara court during the reign of Praudha Deva Raya&quot;. Similarly, the hagiographical epic poem &quot;Basava Purana&quot;, detailing the life of Basava, was expanded and translated into Kannada in 1369 during the reign of Vijayanagara ruler Bukka Raya I.

===Ikkeri Nayakas, Keladi dynasty (16th-18th century)===
The Virasaivas were an important part of the Vijayanagara empire army. They fought the Bijapur Sultans, and the Virasaiva leader Sadasiva Nayaka played a key role in leading the capture of Sultanate fortress such as at Gulbarga. This success led to Nayaka being appointed as the governor of the coastal Karnataka Kanara region. This emerged as a Lingayat dynasty, called the Nayakas of Keladi. Another group of Virasaivas merchants turned warriors of the Vijayanagara empire were successful in defeating the Deccan Sultanates in the Lepakshi region (Karnataka-Andhra Pradesh border region). After the collapse of the Vijayanagara empire, the Lingayat Keladi/Ikkeri dynasty ruled the coastal Karnataka till the invasion and their defeat by Hyder Ali seeking a Mysore-based Sultanate.

The Virasaiva dynasty Nayaka rulers built major 16th to 18th-century shrines and seminaries of Lingayats, repaired and built new Hindu and Jain temples, sponsored major Hindu monasteries such as the Advaita Sringeri matha as well as forts and temples such as at Chitradurga. They also started new towns and merchant centres in coastal and interior Karnataka.

===Varna-status debates (19th–20th century)===
In early decades of the 19th century, the Lingayats were described by British officials such as Francis Buchanan as a conglomeration of Hindu castes with enormous diversity and eclectic, egalitarian social system that accepted converts from all social strata and religions. However, the British officials also noted the endogamous tradition and hereditary occupations of many Lingayats, which made their classification difficult. In the 1871 and the 1881 colonial era census of British India, Lingayats were listed as &quot;shudras&quot;. According to the sociologist M. N. Srinivas, Lingayats traditionally believed themselves to be equal in status to Brahmins, and some orthodox Lingayats were so anti-Brahmin that they would not eat food cooked or handled by Brahmins. The egalitarian Lingayats, states Srinivas, had been a major force in Sanskritization of Kannada-speaking (Karnataka) and nearby regions but against elitism.

After being placed in the shudra category in the 1881 census, Lingayats demanded a higher caste status. This was objected and ridiculed by a Brahmin named Ranganna who said that Lingayats were not Shaiva Brahmins given their eclectic occupations that included washermen, traders, farmers and others, as well as their exogamous relationships with the royal family. Lingayats persisted in their claims for decades, and their persistence was strengthened by Lingayat presence within the government, and a growing level of literacy and employment in journalism and the judiciary. In 1926, the Bombay High Court ruled that &quot;the Veerashaivas are not Shudras.&quot;

According to Schouten, in the early 20th century Lingayats tried to raise their social status, by stressing the specific characteristics of their history and of their religious thought as being distinctive from the Brahmin-dominated Hindu-culture. In the 1910s, the narrative of Basava and Allama as the &quot;founding pillars&quot; of the Lingayats gained new importance for the identity of parts of the Lingayat-community, with other parts responded with rejection of this &quot;resurrection.&quot;

===Separate religious identity (21st century)===
According to Ramanujan, &quot;A modern attempt was made to show Lingayats as having a religion separate from Hindu when Lingayats received discrete entry in the Indian constitution of 1950.&quot; Individuals and community leaders have made intermittent claims for the legal recognition of either being distinct from Hinduism or a caste within Hinduism.

In 2000, the &quot;Akhila Bharatha (All India) Veerashaiva Mahasabha&quot; started a campaign for recognition of &quot;Veerashaivas or Lingayats&quot; as a non-Hindu religion, and a separate listing in the Census. Recognition as a religious minority would make Lingayats &quot;eligible for rights to open and manage educational institutions given by the Constitution to religious and linguistic minorities.&quot; In 2013, the &quot;Akhila Bharatha (All India) Veerashaiva Mahasabha&quot; president was still lobbying for recognition of Lingayats as a separate religious community, arguing that Lingayats rejects the social discrimination propagated by Hinduism.

In 2017, the demands for a separate religious identity gained further momentum on the eve of the 2018 elections in Karnataka. While the Congress party supports the calls for Lingayatism as a separate religion, the BJP regards Lingayats as Veerashaivas and Hindus. In August 2017, a rally march supporting Lingayatism as &quot;not Hinduism&quot; attracted almost 200,000 people, while the issue further divides the Lingayat and Veerashaiva communities, and various opinions exist within the Lingayat and Veerashaiva communities. According to India Today, &quot;Veerashaivas claim that the two communities are one and the same,&quot; while orthodox Lingayats claim that they are different. Veerashaivas further &quot;owe allegiance to various religious centres (mutts), [while] the Lingayats mostly follow their own gurus.&quot; Nevertheless, some mutts support the campaign for the status of a separate religion, while &quot;others content to be counted as a caste within Hinduism.&quot;

In March 2018, the Nagamohan Das committee advised &quot;to form a separate religion status for the Lingayats community.&quot; In response, the Karnataka government approved this separate religious status, a decision which was decried by Veerashaivas. It recommended the Indian government to grant the religious minority status to the sect. Central Government later declined this recommendation.

According to Shivsundar, associate of Gauri Lankesh and former columnist of the Gauri Lankesh Patrike, by the 15th century, Lingayats were absorbed into the Hindu order and associated with Veerashaivas, despite resistance. Over time, they were relegated to a subordinate status. In the 20th century, leaders like Bahu Halakatti revived the egalitarian Vachana philosophy, asserting Lingayat distinctiveness and challenging caste hierarchies. Demands during the British era, such as separate kitchens and Sanskrit education, reflected tensions between their egalitarian ideals and aspirations for higher social status.

Post-independence, Lingayats gained political and educational power but remained culturally tied to Veerashaivas. By the 1980s, a movement sought minority religion status, which gained momentum in 2017 with CM Siddaramaiah’s support. This sparked widespread mobilization among Lingayats but faced opposition from the BJP and RSS, while the Veerashaiva Mahasabha showed mixed reactions.

In the 1980s even the Ramakrishna Mission, which was under pressure from Bengal’s Communist government to reconstitute the governing bodies of some of the Mission-run colleges, claimed it was a non-Hindu minority institution and hence insulated from state interference under Article 30 of the Constitution. 

According to Gauri Lankesh, Veerashaivism is preserved and transmitted by five peethas (Rambhapuri, Ujjaini, Kedar, Shreeshail, Kashi), which play an essential role in the Veerashaiva tradition. In contrast, the monastic organisation upheld &quot;the ideals of Basava and his contemporaries.&quot; According to Bairy, the tradition criticised &quot;[t]he Panchacharya tradition, the Mathas which belonged to it and the (upper) castes which owed their allegiance to them&quot; for their support of Brahmins and their deviation from Basava&#x27;s ideals.

According to Sri Sharanbasava Devaru of Charanteshwar Mutt, interviewed in 2013, Lingayat is a separate religion, distinct from the Hindu cultural identity, while Veerashaivism is a Shaivite sect &quot;based on Vedic philosophy.&quot; Sri Sharanbasava Devaru further states that Veerashaivism &quot;started gaining importance only after 1904 with some mutts mixing Veerashaivas with Lingayats.&quot;

==Characteristics==
Lingayats consider themselves a Hindu sect. Ishtalinga worship is centred on Hindu god Shiva as the universal god in the iconographic form of &quot;Ishtalinga&quot;. They believe that they will be reunited with Shiva after their death by wearing the &quot;lingam&quot;.

===Ishtalinga===
Lingayat worship is centred on the Hindu god Shiva as the universal supreme being in the iconographic form of &quot;ishtalinga&quot;. The Lingayats always wear the &quot;ishtalinga&quot; held with a necklace. The &quot;istalinga&quot; is made up of a small blue-black stone coated with fine durable thick black paste of cow dung ashes mixed with some suitable oil to withstand wear and tear. It is viewed as a &quot;living, moving&quot; divinity of the Lingayat devotee. Every day, the devotee removes the &quot;ishtalinga&quot; from its box, places it the in left palm, offers &quot;puja&quot;, and then meditates about becoming one with the &quot;lingam&quot;, in their journey towards the &quot;atma-linga&quot;.

===Soteriology===

====Shatsthala====
Lingayat principle teaches a path to an individual&#x27;s spiritual progress, and describes it as a six-stage &quot;Satsthalasiddhanta&quot;. This concept progressively evolves:
* the individual starts with the phase of a devotee,
* the phase of the master,
* the phase of the receiver of grace,
* Linga in life breath (god dwells in his or her soul),
* the phase of surrender (awareness of no distinction in god and soul, self),
* the last stage of complete union of soul and god (liberation, mukti).

Thus bhakti progresses from external icon-aided loving devotional worship of Shiva to deeper fusion of awareness with abstract Shiva, ultimately to advaita (oneness) of one&#x27;s soul and god for &quot;moksha&quot;.

====Mukti====
While Lingayats accept the concept of transmigration of soul (metempsychosis, reincarnation), they believe that they are in their last lifetime and will be reunited with Shiva after their death by wearing the &quot;lingam&quot;. Lingayats are not cremated, but &quot;are buried in a sitting, meditative position, holding their personal linga in the right hand.&quot;

Indologist F. Otto Schrader was among early scholars who studied Lingayat texts and its stand on metempsychosis. According to Schrader, it was Abbe Dubois who first remarked that Lingayats rejects metempsychosis – the belief that the soul of a human being or animal transmigrates into a new body after death. This remark about &quot;rejecting rebirth&quot; was repeated by others, states Schrader, and it led to the question whether Lingayats make a religion distinct from other Indian religions such as Hinduism where metempsychosis and rebirth is a fundamental premise. According to Schrader, Dubois was incorrect and Lingayat texts such as &quot;Viramahesvaracara-samgraha&quot;, &quot;Anadi-virasaivasara-samgraha&quot;, &quot;Sivatattva ratnakara&quot; (by Basava), and &quot;Lingait Paramesvara Agama&quot; confirm that metempsychosis is a fundamental premise of Lingayats. According to Schrader, Lingayats believe that if they live an ethical life then this will be their last life, and they will merge into Shiva, a belief that has fed the confusion that they do not believe in rebirth. According to R. Blake Michael, rebirth and ways to end rebirth was extensively discussed by Basava, Allama Prabhu, Siddharameshawar and other religious saints of Lingayats.

===Shiva: non-dualism and qualified monism===

====Qualified non-dualism====
&quot;Shunya&quot;, in a series of Kannada language texts, is equated with the Virashaiva concept of the Supreme. In particular, the &quot;Shunya Sampadane&quot; texts present the ideas of Allama Prabhu in a form of dialogue, where &quot;shunya&quot; is that void and distinctions which a spiritual journey seeks to fill and eliminate. It is the described as state of union of one&#x27;s soul with the infinite Shiva, the state of blissful moksha.

This Lingayat concept is similar to &quot;shunya Brahma&quot; concept found in certain texts of Vaishnavism, particularly in Odiya, such as the poetic &quot;Panchasakhas&quot;. It explains the &quot;Nirguna Brahman&quot; idea of Vedanta, that is the eternal unchanging metaphysical reality as &quot;personified void&quot;. Alternate names for this concept of Hinduism, include &quot;shunya purusha&quot; and &quot;Jagannatha&quot; in certain texts. However, both in Lingayats and various flavors of Vaishnavism such as &quot;Mahima Dharma&quot;, the idea of &quot;Shunya&quot; is closer to the Hindu concept of metaphysical &quot;Brahman&quot;, rather than to the &quot;Śūnyatā&quot; concept of Buddhism. However, there is some overlap, such as in the works of Bhima Bhoi.

Sripati, a Veerashaiva scholar, explained Lingayat philosophy in &quot;Srikara Bhashya&quot;, in Vedanta terms, stating it to be a form of qualified non-dualism, wherein the individual Atman (soul) is the body of God, and that there is no difference between Shiva and Atman (self, soul), Shiva is one&#x27;s Atman, one&#x27;s Atman is Shiva. Sripati&#x27;s analysis places Lingayat philosophy in a form closer to the 11th century Vishishtadvaita philosopher Ramanuja, than to Advaita philosopher Adi Shankara.

====Qualified monism====
Other scholars state that Lingayat philosophy is more complex than the description of the Veerashaiva scholar Sripati. It united diverse spiritual trends during Basava&#x27;s era. Jan Peter Schouten states that it tends towards monotheism with Shiva as the godhead, but with a strong awareness of the monistic unity of the Ultimate Reality. Schouten calls this as a synthesis of Ramanuja&#x27;s Vishishtadvaita and Shankara&#x27;s Advaita traditions, naming it &quot;Shakti-Vishishtadvaita&quot;, that is monism fused with Shakti beliefs. But Basava&#x27;s approach is different than Adi Shankara, states Schouten, in that Basava emphasises the path of devotion, compared to Shankara&#x27;s emphasis on the path of knowledge—a system of monistic Advaita philosophy widely discussed in Karnataka in the time of Basava.

====Panchacharas====

The &quot;Panchacharas&quot; describe the five codes of conduct to be followed by the Lingayats. The &quot;Panchacharas&quot; include:
* Lingāchāra – Daily worship of the individual Ishtalinga icon, one to three times day.
* Sadāchāra – Attention to vocation and duty, and adherence to the seven rules of conduct issued by Basavanna:
** (Do not steal)
** (Do not kill or hurt)
** (Do not utter lies)
** (Do not praise yourself*, i.e., practice humility)
** (Do not criticize others)
** (shun anger)
** (Do not be intolerant towards others)
* Sivāchāra – acknowledging Shiva as the supreme divine being and upholding the equality and well-being of all human beings.
* Bhrityāchāra – Compassion towards all creatures.
* Ganāchāra – Defence of the community and its tenets.

====Ashtavarana====
The &quot;Ashtavaranas&quot;, the eight-fold armour that shields the devotee from extraneous distraction and worldly attachments. The &quot;Ashtavaranas&quot; include:
* Guru – obedience towards Guru, the Mentor;
* Linga – wearing the &quot;Ishtalinga&quot; on your body at all times;
* Jangama – reverence for Shiva ascetics as incarnations of divinity;
* Pādodaka – sipping the water used for bathing the Linga;
* Prasāda – sacred offerings;
* Vibhuti – smearing holy ash on oneself daily;
* Rudrāksha – wearing a string of &quot;rudraksha&quot; (holy beads, seeds of Elaeocarpus ganitrus);
* Mantra – reciting the mantra of &quot;Namah Shivaya: (salutation to Shiva)&quot;

====&quot;Kāyakavē Kailāsa&quot; doctrine and karma====

&quot;Kayakave kailasa&quot; is a slogan in Veerashaivism. It means &quot;work is heaven&quot; or &quot;to work [&quot;Kayakave&quot;] is to be in the Lord&#x27;s Kingdom [&quot;Kailasa&quot;]&quot;. Some scholars translate &quot;Kayaka&quot; as &quot;worship, ritual&quot;, while others translate it as &quot;work, labour&quot;. The slogan is attributed to Basava, and generally interpreted to signify a work ethic for all social classes.

Lingayat poet-saints accepted the concept of &quot;karma&quot; and repeatedly mention it in their Shiva poetry. For example, states Ramanujan, Mahadeviyakka mentions karma and resulting chain of rebirths that are cut short by bhakti to Shiva. Lingayats have the concepts of karma and dharma, but the Lingayat doctrine of karma is not one of fate and destiny. Lingayats believe in &quot;kayaka&quot; (work) and the transformative potential of &quot;one&#x27;s work in the here and now&quot;. According to Schouten, Siddharama and Allama debated the doctrine of karma as the law of work and merit, but Allama persuaded Siddharama that such merit is a low-level mechanism, and real mystical achievement transcends &quot;the sphere of works and rewards&quot; and is void of self-interest. These ideas, states Schouten, are similar to those found in Bhagavad Gita which teaches &quot;work must be done without any attachment to the results&quot;.

====Dāsoha doctrine====
&quot;Dasoha&quot; is the purpose and result of &quot;Kāyakavē Kailāsa&quot; in Lingayat philosophy. &quot;Dasoha&quot; means &quot;service&quot;, and more specifically &quot;service to other Lingayats&quot; including the &quot;Jangama&quot;. Regardless of one&#x27;s vocation, Lingayats suggest giving and donating a part of one&#x27;s time, effort and income to one&#x27;s community and to religious mendicants.

According to Virasaivism, skilful work and service to one&#x27;s community, without discrimination, is a means to experiencing the divine, a sentiment that continues to be revered in present-day Virasaivas. According to Jan Peter Schouten, this doctrine is philosophically rooted in the more ancient So&#x27;ham Sanskrit oneness mantra related to Shiva, and which means &quot;I am He&quot;. This social ethic is also found among other Hindu communities of South India, and includes community provisioning of grains and sharing other essentials particularly with poorer members of society and those affected by natural or other disasters.

===Lingadharane===
&quot;Lingadharane&quot; is the ceremony of initiation among Lingayats. Though &quot;lingadharane&quot; can be performed at any age, it is usually performed when a fetus in the womb is 7–8 months old. The family Guru performs pooja and provides the ishtalinga to the mother, who then ties it to her own ishtalinga until birth. At birth the mother secures the new ishtalinga to her child. Upon attaining the age of 8–11 years, the child receives &quot;Diksha&quot; from the family Guru to know the proper procedure to perform pooja of ishtalinga. From birth to death, the child wears the Linga at all times and it is worshipped as a personal ishtalinga. The &quot;Linga&quot; is wrapped in a cloth housed in a small silver and wooden box. It is to be worn on the chest, over the seat of the indwelling deity within the heart. Some people wear it on the chest or around the body using a thread.

===Vegetarianism===
Lingayats are strict vegetarians. Devout Lingayats do not consume meat of any kind including fish. The drinking of liquor is prohibited.

===Temples and rites of passage===
Lingayats believe that the human body is a temple. In addition, they have continued to build the community halls and Shaiva temple traditions of South India. Their temples include Shiva linga in the sanctum, a sitting Nandi facing the linga, with mandapa and other features. However, the prayers and offerings are not led by Brahmin priests but by Lingayat priests (Veerashaiva Jangama). The temple format is simpler than those of Jains and Hindus found in north Karnataka. In some parts of Karnataka, these temples are samadhis of Lingayat saints, in others such as the Veerabhadra temple of Belgavi – one of the important pilgrimage sites for Lingayats, and other historic temples, the Shiva temple is operated and maintained by Lingayat priests. Many rural Lingayat communities include the images of Shiva, Parvati and Ganesha in their wedding invitations, while Ganesha festivities are observed by both rural and urban Lingayats in many parts of Karnataka. Colonial-era reports by British officials confirm that Lingayats observed Ganesha Chaturthi in the 19th century.

===Festivals===
They celebrate most of the Hindu festivals and their own festivals;
* Ganesh Chaturthi
* Maha Shivaratri

==Literature==

===Lingayat literature===

Several works are attributed to the founder of Lingayat movement, Basava, and these texts are revered in the Lingayat community. In particular, these include various &quot;Vachana&quot; (literally, &quot;what is said&quot;) such as the &quot;Shat-sthala-vachana&quot;, &quot;Kala-jnana-vachana&quot;, &quot;Mantra-gopya&quot;, &quot;Ghatachakra-vachana&quot; and &quot;Raja-yoga-vachana&quot;. Saints and Sharanas like Allamaprabhu, Akka Mahadevi, Siddarama and Basava were at the forefront of this development during the 12th century.

Other important Lingayat literature includes:
* Shunyasampadane
* Mantra Gopya
* Shunya Sampadane
* Karana Hasuge

The &quot;Basava Purana&quot;, a Telugu biographical epic poem which narrates the life story of Basava, was written by Palkuriki Somanatha in 13th-century, and an updated 14th-century Kannada version was written by Bhima Kavi in 1369. Both are sacred texts for lingayats.

===Vedas and shastras===
Lingayat (Veerashaiva) thinkers rejected the custodial hold of Brahmins over the Vedas and the shastras, but they did not outright reject the Vedic knowledge. The 13th-century Telugu Virashaiva poet Palkuriki Somanatha, author of Basava Purana—a scripture of Veerashaivas, for example asserted, &quot;Virashaivism fully conformed to the Vedas and the shastras.&quot; Somanatha repeatedly stated that &quot;he was a scholar of the four Vedas&quot;.

Lingayats consider the Vedas as a means, but not the sanctimonious end. It rejected various forms of ritualism and the uncritical adherence to any text including the Vedas.

===Anubhava Mantapa===
The &quot;Anubhava Mantapa&quot; literally means the &quot;hall of spiritual experience&quot;. It has been a Lingayat institution since the time of Basava, serving as an academy of mystics, saints and poet-philosophers for discussion of spiritual and mundane questions of life, in open. It was the fountainhead of all religious and philosophical thought pertaining to the Lingayata. It was presided over by the mystic Allamaprabhu, and numerous sharanas from all over Karnataka and other parts of India were participants. This institution also helped propagate lingayat&#x27;s religious and philosophical thought. Akka Mahadevi, Channabasavanna and Basavanna himself were participants in the Anubhava Mantapa.

==Demographics==
Lingayats today are found predominantly in the state of Karnataka, especially in North and Central Karnataka with a sizeable population native to South Karnataka. Lingayats have been estimated to be about 16% of Karnataka&#x27;s population and about 6-7% of Maharashtra&#x27;s population.. Lingayat Vani community is present in marathwada and Kolhapur, Konkan region and were traders, Zamindars in medieval era. The Lingayat diaspora can be found in countries around the world, particularly the United States, Britain and Australia.

==Reservation status==

Today, the Lingayat community is a blend of various castes, consisting of OBC and SC. Currently, 16 castes of Lingayats have been accorded the OBC status by the Central Government. According to one of the estimates by a Lingayat politician around 7 per cent of people in Lingayat community come under SC and STs. Veerashaiva Lingayats get OBC reservation at state level in both Karnataka and Telangana.
