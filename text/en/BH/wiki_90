<text>Gap junctions are membrane channels between adjacent cells that allow the direct exchange of cytoplasmic substances. Substances exchanged include small molecules, substrates, and metabolites.

Gap junctions were first described as &quot;close appositions&quot; as other tight junctions, but following electron microscopy studies in 1967, they were renamed gap junctions to distinguish them from tight junctions. They bridge a 2-4 nm gap between cell membranes.

Gap junctions use protein complexes known as connexons to connect one cell to another. The proteins are called connexins. Gap junction proteins include the more than 26 types of connexin, and at least 12 non-connexin components that make up the gap junction complex or &quot;nexus&quot;. These components include the tight junction protein ZO-1—a protein that holds membrane content together and adds structural clarity to a cell, sodium channels, and aquaporin.

More gap junction proteins have become known due to the development of next-generation sequencing. Connexins were found to be structurally homologous between vertebrates and invertebrates but different in sequence. As a result, the term innexin is used to differentiate invertebrate connexins. There are more than 20 known innexins, along with unnexins in parasites and vinnexins in viruses.

An electrical synapse is a gap junction that can transmit action potentials between neurons. Such synapses create bidirectional continuous-time electrical coupling between neurons. Connexon pairs act as generalized regulated gates for ions and smaller molecules between cells. Hemichannel connexons form channels to the extracellular environment.

A gap junction or &quot;macula communicans&quot; is different from an ephaptic coupling that involves electrical signals external to the cells.

==Structure==
In vertebrates, gap junction hemichannels are primarily homo- or hetero-hexamers of connexin proteins. Hetero-hexamers at gap junction plaques, help form a uniform intercellular space of 2-4 nm. In this way hemichannels in the membrane of each cell are aligned with one another forming an intercellular communication path.

Invertebrate gap junctions comprise proteins from the innexin family. Innexins have no significant sequence homology with connexins. Though differing in sequence to connexins, innexins are similar enough to connexins to form gap junctions &quot;in vivo&quot; in the same way connexins do.

The more recently characterized pannexin family, which was originally thought to form intercellular channels (with an amino acid sequence similar to innexins) in fact functions as a single-membrane channel that communicates with the extracellular environment and has been shown to pass calcium and ATP. This has led to the idea that pannexins may not form intercellular junctions in the same way connexins and innexins do and therefore should not use the same hemi-channel/channel naming. Others have presented evidence based on genetic sequencing and overall functioning in tissues, that pannexins should still be considered part of the gap junction family of proteins despite structural differences. These researchers also note that there are still more groups of connexin orthologs to be discovered.

Gap junction channels formed from two identical hemichannels are called homotypic, while those with differing hemichannels are heterotypic. In turn, hemichannels of uniform protein composition are called homomeric, while those with differing proteins are heteromeric. Channel composition influences the function of gap junction channels, and different connexins will not necessarily form heterotypic with all others.

Before innexins and connexins were well characterized, the genes coding for the connexin gap junction channels were classified in one of three groups (A, B and C; for example, , ), based on gene mapping and sequence similarity. However, connexin genes do not code directly for the expression of gap junction channels; genes can produce only the proteins that make up gap junction channels. An alternative naming system based on the protein&#x27;s molecular weight is the most widely used (for example, connexin43=GJA1, connexin30.3=GJB4).

==Levels of organization==
In vertebrates, two pairs of six connexin proteins form a connexon. In invertebrates, six innexin proteins form an innexon. Otherwise, the structures are similar.
# The connexin genes (DNA) are transcribed to RNA, which is then translated to produce a connexin.
# One connexin protein has four transmembrane domains
# Six connexin proteins create one connexon channel a hemichannel. When identical connexin proteins join to form one connexon, it is called a homomeric connexon. When different connexin proteins join to form one connexon, it is called a heteromeric connexon.
# Two connexons, joined across a cell membrane, comprise a gap junction channel.When two identical connexons come together to form a gap junction channel, it is called a homotypic channel. When one homomeric connexon and one heteromeric connexon come together, it is called a heterotypic gap junction channel. When two heteromeric connexons join, it is also called a heterotypic gap junction channel.
# Tens to thousands of gap junction channels cluster in areas to enable connexon pairs to form. The macromolecular complex is called a gap junction plaque. Molecules other than connexins are involved in gap junction plaques including tight junction protein 1 and sodium channels.

==Properties of connexon pairs==
A connexon or innexon channel pair:
# Allows for direct electrical communication between cells, although different hemichannel subunits can impart different single channel conductances, from about 30 pS to 500 pS.
# Allows for chemical communication between cells through the transmission of small second messengers, such as inositol triphosphate () and calcium (), although different hemichannel subunits can impart different selectivities for particular molecules.
# Generally allows transmembrane movement of molecules smaller than 485 daltons (1,100 daltons through invertebrate gap junctions), although different hemichannel subunits may impart different pore sizes and different charge selectivity. Large biomolecules, including nucleic acids and proteins, are precluded from cytoplasmic transfer between cells through gap junction hemichannel pairs.
# Ensures that molecules and current passing through the gap junction do not leak into the intercellular space.

==Properties of connexons as hemichannels==
Unpaired connexons or innexons can act as hemichannels in a single membrane, allowing the cell to exchange molecules directly with the exterior of the cell. It has been shown that connexons would be available to do this prior to being incorporated into the gap junction plaques. Some of the properties of these unpaired connexons are listed below:
#Pore or transmembrane channel size is highly variable, in the range of approximately 8-20Å in diameter.
#They connect the cytoplasm of the cell to the cell exterior and are thought to be in a closed state by default in order to prevent leakage from the cell.
#Some connexons respond to external factors by opening up. Mechanical shear and various diseases can cause this to happen.
Establishing further connexon properties different to those of connexon pairs, proves difficult due to separating their effects experimentally in organisms.

==Occurrence and distribution==
Gap Junctions have been observed in various animal organs and tissues where cells contact each other. From the 1950s to 1970s they were detected in:

* Human islet of Langerhans, myometrium, and eye lens
* Rat pancreas, liver, adrenal cortex, epididymis, duodenum, muscle, and seminiferous tubules
* Rabbit cornea, ovary, and skin
* Monkey retina
* Chick embryos
* Frog embryos
* Fish blastoderm
* Crayfish nerves
* Lamprey and Tunicate heart
* Goldfish and hamster pressure-sensing acoustico-vestibular receptors
* &quot;Daphnia&quot; hepatic caecum
* Cephalopod digestive epithelium
* &quot;Hydra&quot; muscle
* Cockroach hemocyte capsules
* Reaggregated cells

Gap junctions have continue to be found in nearly all healthy animal cells that touch each other. Techniques such as confocal microscopy allow more rapid surveys of large areas of tissue. Tissues that were traditionally considered to have isolated cells such as in bone were shown to have cells that were still connected with gap junctions, however tenuously. Exceptions to this are cells not normally in contact with neighboring cells such as blood cells suspended in blood plasma. Adult skeletal muscle is a possible exception to the rule though their large size makes it difficult to be certain of this. An argument used against skeletal muscle gap junctions is that if they were present gap junctions may propagate contractions in an arbitrary way through cells making up the muscle. However, other muscle types do have gap junctions which do not cause arbitrary contractions. Sometimes the number of gap junctions are reduced or absent in diseased tissues such as cancers or the aging process.

Since the discovery of innexins, pannexins and unnexins, gaps in our knowledge of intercellular communication are becoming more defined. Innexins look and behave similarly to connexins and can be seen to fill a similar role to connexins in invertebrates. Pannexins also look individually similar to connexins though they do not appear to easily form gap junctions. Of the over 20 metazoan groups connexins have been found only in vertebrata and tunicata. Innexins and pannexins are far more widespread including innexin homologues in vertebrates. The unicellular Trypanosomatidae parasites presumably have unnexin genes to aid in their infection of animals including humans. The even smaller adenovirus has its own vinnexin, apparently derived from an innexin, to aid its transmission between the virus&#x27;s insect hosts.

The term &quot;gap junction&quot; cannot be defined by a single protein or family of proteins with a specific function. For example, gap junction structures are found in sponges, despite the absence of pannexins. While we are still at the early stages of understanding the nervous system of a sponge the &quot;gap junctions&quot; of sponges may as yet indicate intercellular communications pathways.

==Functions==
At least five discrete functions have been ascribed to gap junction proteins:
# Electrical and metabolic coupling between cells
# Electrical and metabolic exchange through hemichannels
# Tumor suppressor genes (Cx43, Cx32 and Cx36)
# Adhesive function independent of conductive gap junction channel (neural migration in neocortex)
# Role of carboxyl-terminal in signaling cytoplasmic pathways (Cx43)

In a more general sense, gap junctions may be seen to function at the simplest level as a direct cell to cell pathway for electrical currents, small molecules and ions. The control of this communication allows complex downstream effects on multicellular organisms.

===Embryonic, organ and tissue development===
In the 1980s, more subtle roles of gap junctions in communication have been investigated. It was discovered that gap junction communication could be disrupted by adding anti-connexin antibodies into embryonic cells. Embryos with areas of blocked gap junctions failed to develop normally. The mechanism by which antibodies blocked the gap junctions was unclear; systematic studies were undertaken to elucidate the mechanism. Refinement of these studies suggested that gap junctions were key in the development of cell polarity and the left-right symmetry in animals. While signaling that determines the position of body organs appears to rely on gap junctions, so does the more fundamental differentiation of cells at later stages of embryonic development.

Gap junctions were found to be responsible for the transmission of signals required for drugs to have an effect. Conversely, some drugs were shown to block gap junction channels.

===The bystander effect and disease===

====Cell death====
The &quot;bystander effect&quot; has its connotations of the innocent bystander being killed. When cells are dying or compromised due to disease or injury, messages are transmitted to neighboring cells by gap junctions. This can cause otherwise healthy bystander cells to also die. 

The bystander effect was later researched with regard to cells damaged by radiation or mechanical injury and in turn wound healing. Disease seems to have an effect on the ability of gap junctions to fulfill their roles in wound healing. The oral administration of gap junction blockers to reduce the symptoms of disease in remote parts of the body is slowly becoming a reality.

====Tissue restructuring====
While there has been a tendency to focus on the bystander effect in disease due to the possibility of therapeutic avenues, there is evidence that there is a more central role in normal development of tissues. Death of some cells and their surrounding matrix may be required for a tissue to reach its final configuration; gap junctions appear essential to this process. There are also more complex studies that try to combine our understanding of the simultaneous roles of gap junctions in both wound healing and tissue development.

====Disease====
Mutations in connexins have been associated with many diseases in humans, including deafness, heart atrial fibrillation (standstill) and cataracts. The study of these mutations has helped clarify some of the functions of connexins.

Hemichannels are thought to play a general role in the progression and severity of many diseases; this is in part due to hemichannels being an open door to the outside of each cell.

===Areas of electrical coupling===
Gap junctions electrically couple cells throughout the body of most animals. Electrical coupling can be relatively fast acting and can be used over short distances within an organism. Tissues in this section have well known functions observed to be coordinated by gap junctions, with intercellular signaling happening in time frames of microseconds or less.

====Heart====
Gap junctions are particularly important in cardiac muscle: the signal to contract is passed efficiently through gap junctions, allowing the heart muscle cells to contract in unison. The importance is emphasized by a secondary ephaptic pathway for the signal to contract also being associated with the gap junction plaques. This redundancy in signal transmission associated with gap junction plaques is the first to be described and involves sodium channels rather than connexins.

====Eye lens====
Precise control of light refraction, structural dimensions and transparency are key aspects of the eye lens structure that allow focusing by the eye. Transparency is aided by the absence of nerves and blood vessels from the lens, so gap junctions are left with a larger loading of intercellular communication than in other tissues reflected in large numbers of gap junctions. The crystallinity of the lens also means the cells and gap junctions are well ordered for systematic mapping of where the gap junction plaques are. As no cells are lost from the lens interior during the life of the animal, a complete map of the gap junctions is possible.

The associated figure shows how the size, shape, and frequency of gap junction plaques change with cell growth. With growth, fiber cells are progressively isolated from more direct metabolite exchange with the aqueous humor through the capsule and lens epithelium. The isolation correlates with the classical circular shape of larger plaques shown in the yellow zone being disrupted. Changing the fiber cells&#x27; morphology requires the movements of vesicles through the gap junction plaques at higher frequencies in this area.

====Neurons====
A gap junction located between neurons is often referred to as an electrical synapse. The electrical synapse was discovered using electrical measurements before the gap junction structure was described. Electrical synapses are present throughout the central nervous system and have been studied specifically in the neocortex, hippocampus, vestibular nucleus, thalamic reticular nucleus, locus coeruleus, inferior olivary nucleus, mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, ventral tegmental area, olfactory bulb, retina and spinal cord of vertebrates.

There has been some observation of coupling in the locus coeruleus between weak neurons and glial cells and in the cerebellum between Purkinje neurons and Bergmann glial cells. It appears that astrocytes are coupled by gap junctions, both to other astrocytes and to oligodendrocytes. Moreover, mutations in the gap junction genes Cx43 and Cx56.6 cause white matter degeneration similar to that observed in Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease and multiple sclerosis.

Connexin proteins expressed in neuronal gap junctions include mCX36, mCX57, and mCX45, with mRNAs for at least five other connexins (mCx26, mCx30.2, mCx32, mCx43, mCx47) detected but without immunocytochemical evidence for the corresponding protein within ultrastructurally-defined gap junctions. Those mRNAs appear to be downregulated or destroyed by micro interfering RNAs (miRNAs) that are cell-type and cell-lineage specific.
Astrocytes

An important feature of astrocytes is their high expression levels of the gap junction proteins connexin 30 (Cx30) and connexin 43 (Cx43). These proteins play crucial roles in regulating brain homeostasis through potassium buffering, intercellular communication, and nutrient transport. Connexins typically form gap junction channels that allow direct intercellular communication between astrocytes. However, they can also form hemichannels that facilitate the exchange of ions and molecules with the extracellular space.

Studies have highlighted channel-independent functions of connexins, involving intracellular signaling, protein interactions, and cell adhesion. Specifically, Cx30 has been shown to regulate the insertion of astroglial processes into synaptic clefts, which controls the efficacy of glutamate clearance. This, in turn, affects the synaptic strength and long-term plasticity of excitatory terminals, indicating a significant role in modulating synaptic transmission. Levels of Cx30 regulate synaptic glutamate concentration, hippocampal excitatory synaptic strength, plasticity, and memory. Astroglial networks have a physiologically optimized size to appropriately regulate neuronal functions.

Cx30 is not limited to regulating excitatory synaptic transmission but also plays a crucial role in inhibitory synaptic regulation and broader neuronal network activities. This highlights the importance of connexins in maintaining the intricate balance required for proper brain function.

====Retina====
Neurons within the retina show extensive coupling, both within populations of one cell type and between different cell types.

====Uterus====
The uterine muscle (myometrium) remains in a quiescent relaxed state during pregnancy to maintain fetal development. Immediately preceding labor, the myometrium transforms into an activated contractile unit by increasing expression of connexin-43 (CX43, a.k.a. Gap Junction Alpha-1 protein, GJA1) facilitating gap junction (GJ) formation between individual myometrial cells. Importantly, the formation of GJs promotes communication between neighbouring myocytes, which facilitates the transfer of small molecules such as secondary messengers, metabolites, and small ions for electrical coupling. Consistent with all species, uterine myometrial contractions propagate from spontaneous action potentials as a result of sudden change in plasma membrane permeability. This leads to an increase of intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration, facilitating action potential propagation through electrically coupled cells. It has more recently been discovered that uterine macrophages directly physically couples with uterine myocytes through CX43, transferring Ca²⁺, to promote uterine muscle contraction and excitation during labor onset.

===Hemichannel function===

Hemichannels contribute to a cellular network of gap junctions and allow the release of sdenosine triphosphate, glutamate, Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, and prostaglandin E2 from cells, which can all act as messengers to cells otherwise disconnected from such messaging. In this sense, a gap junction plaque forms a one-to-one relationship with the neighboring cell, daisy chaining many cells together. Hemichannels form a one to many relationship with the surrounding tissue.

On a larger scale, the one-to-many communication of cells is typically carried out by the vascular and nervous systems. This makes detecting the contribution of hemichannels to extracellular communication more difficult in whole organisms. With the eye lens, the vascular and nervous systems are absent, making reliance on hemichannels greater and their detection easier. At the interface of the lens with the aqueous humor (where the lens exchanges metabolites), both gap junction plaques and more diffused connexon distribution can be seen in the accompanying micrographs.

==Discovery==
===Form to function===
Well before the demonstration of the gap in gap junctions, they were seen at the junction of neighboring nerve cells. The close proximity of the neighboring cell membranes at the gap junction led researchers to speculate that they had a role in intercellular communication, in particular the transmission of electrical signals. Gap junctions were also found to be electrically rectifying in the early studies and referred to as an electrical synapse but are now known to be bidirectional in general. Later, it was found that chemicals could also be transported between cells through gap junctions.

Implicit or explicit in most of the early studies is that the area of the gap junction was different in structure to the surrounding membranes in a way that made it look different. The gap junction had been shown to create a micro-environment between the two cells in the extracellular space or &quot;gap&quot;. This portion of extracellular space was somewhat isolated from the surrounding space and also bridged by what we now call connexon pairs, which form even more tightly sealed bridges that cross the gap junction gap between two cells. When viewed in the plane of the membrane by freeze-fracture techniques, higher-resolution distribution of connexons within the gap junction plaque is possible.

Connexin free islands are observed in some junctions. The observation was largely without explanation until vesicles were shown by Peracchia using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) thin sections to be systematically associated with gap junction plaques. Peracchia&#x27;s study was probably also the first study to describe paired connexon structures, which he called a &quot;globule&quot;. Studies showing vesicles associated with gap junctions and proposing the vesicle contents may move across the junction plaques between two cells were rare, as most studies focused on connexons rather than vesicles. A later study using a combination of microscopy techniques confirmed the early evidence of a probable function for gap junctions in intercellular vesicle transfer. Areas of vesicle transfer were associated with connexin free islands within gap junction plaques. Connexin 43 has been shown to be necessary for the transfer of whole mitochondrias to neighboring cells, though whether the mitochondria is transferred directly through the membrane or within a vesicle has not been determined 

===Electrical and chemical synapses===
Because of the widespread occurrence of gap junctions in cell types other than nerve cells, the term &quot;gap junction&quot; became more generally used than terms such as electrical synapse or nexus. Another dimension in the relationship between nerve cells and gap junctions was revealed by studying chemical synapse formation and gap junction presence. By tracing nerve development in leeches with gap junction expression suppressed it was shown that the bidirectional gap junction (electrical nerve synapse) needs to form between two cells before they can grow to form a unidirectional &quot;chemical nerve synapse&quot;. The chemical nerve synapse is the synapse most often truncated to the more ambiguous term &quot;nerve synapse&quot;.

===Composition===

====Connexins====
The purification of the intercellular gap junction plaques enriched in the channel forming protein (connexin) showed a protein forming hexagonal arrays in x-ray diffraction. Because of this, the systematic study and identification of the predominant gap junction protein became possible. 
Refined ultrastructural studies by TEM showed protein occurred in a complementary fashion in both cells participating in a gap junction plaque. The gap junction plaque is a relatively large area of membrane observed in TEM thin section and freeze fracture (FF) seen filled with transmembrane proteins in both tissues and more gently treated gap junction preparations. With the apparent ability for one protein alone to enable intercellular communication seen in gap junctions the term gap junction tended to become synonymous with a group of assembled connexins though this was not shown in vivo. Biochemical analysis of gap junction isolated from various tissues demonstrated a family of connexins.

The ultrastructure and biochemistry of isolated gap junctions already referenced had indicated the connexins preferentially group in gap junction plaques or domains and connexins were the best characterized constituent. It has been noted that the organisation of proteins into arrays with a gap junction plaque may be significant. It is likely this early work was already reflecting the presence of more than just connexins in gap junctions. Combining the emerging fields of freeze-fracture to see inside membranes and immunocytochemistry to label cell components (Freeze-fracture replica immunolabelling or FRIL and thin section immunolabelling) showed gap junction plaques in vivo contained the connexin protein. Later studies using immunofluorescence microscopy of larger areas of tissue clarified diversity in earlier results. Gap junction plaques were confirmed to have variable composition being home to connexon and non-connexin proteins as well making the modern usage of the terms &quot;gap junction&quot; and &quot;gap junction plaque&quot; non-interchangeable. To summarize, in early literature the term &quot;gap junction&quot; referred to the regular gap between membranes in vertebrates and non-vertebrates apparently bridged by &quot;globules&quot;. The junction correlated with the cell&#x27;s ability to directly couple with its neighbors through pores in their membranes. Then for a while gap junctions were only referring to a structure that contains connexins and nothing more was thought to be involved. Later, the gap junction &quot;plaque&quot; was also found to contain other molecules that helped define it and make it function.

====The &quot;plaque&quot; or &quot;formation plaque&quot;====

Early descriptions of &quot;gap junctions&quot;, &quot;connexons&quot; or &quot;innexons&quot; did not refer to them as such; many other terms were used. It is likely that &quot;synaptic disks&quot; were an accurate reference to gap junction plaques. While the detailed structure and function of the connexon was described in a limited way at the time the gross &quot;disk&quot; structure was relatively large and easily seen by various TEM techniques. Disks allowed researchers using TEM to easily locate the connexons contained within the disk like patches in vivo and in vitro. The disk or &quot;plaque&quot; appeared to have structural properties different from those imparted by the connexons/innexons alone. It was thought that if the area of membrane in the plaque transmitted signals, the area of membrane would have to be sealed in some way to prevent leakage.
Later studies showed gap junction plaques are home to non-connexin proteins, making the modern usage of the terms &quot;gap junction&quot; and &quot;gap junction plaque&quot; non-interchangeable as the area of the gap junction plaque may contain proteins other than connexins. Just as connexins do not always occupy the entire area of the plaque, the other components described in the literature may be only long-term or short-term residents.

Studies allowing views inside the plane of the membrane of gap junctions during formation indicated that a &quot;formation plaque&quot; formed between two cells prior to the connexins moving in. They were particle free areas—when observed by TEM FF, indicated very small or no transmembrane proteins were likely present. Little is known about what structures make up the formation plaque or how the formation plaque&#x27;s structure changes when connexins and other components move in and out. One of the earlier studies of the formation of small gap junctions describes rows of particles and particle free halos. With larger gap junctions they were described as formation plaques with connexins moving into them. The particulate gap junctions were thought to form 4–6 hours after the formation plaques appeared. How the connexins may be transported to the plaques using tubulin is becoming clearer.

The formation of plaque and the non-connexin part of the classical gap junction plaque have been difficult for early researchers to analyse. It appears in TEM FF and thin section to be a lipid membrane domain that can somehow form a comparatively rigid barrier to other lipids and proteins. There has been indirect evidence for certain lipids being preferentially involved with the formation plaque, however this cannot be considered definitive. It is difficult to envisage breaking up the membrane to analyse membrane plaques without affecting their composition. By study of connexins still in membranes lipids associated with the connexins have been studied. It was found that specific connexins tended to associate preferentially with specific phospholipids. As formation plaques precede connexins these results still give no certainty as to what is unique about the composition of plaques themselves. Other findings show connexins associate with protein scaffolds used in another junction, the zonula occludens ZO-1. While this helps us understand how connexins may be moved into a gap junction formation plaque, the composition of the plaque itself is still somewhat sketchy. Some headway on the in vivo composition of the gap junction plaque is being made using TEM FRIL.

<text>Lieutenant General Stanisław Władysław Maczek (; 31 March 1892 – 11 December 1994) was a Polish tank commander of World War II, whose division was instrumental in the Allied liberation of France, closing the Falaise pocket, resulting in the destruction of 14 German Wehrmacht and SS divisions. A veteran of World War I, the Polish–Ukrainian and Polish–Soviet wars, Maczek was the commander of Poland&#x27;s only major armoured formation during the September 1939 campaign, and later commanded a Polish armoured formation in France in 1940. He was the commander of the famous 1st Polish Armoured Division, and later of the I Polish Army Corps under Allied Command in 1942–45.

==Family==
Stanisław Władysław Maczek was born on 31 March 1892 in the Lwów suburb of Szczerzec (now Ukrainian: Shchyrets), then in Austro-Hungarian Galicia. His father was a lawyer, who after retiring opened chambers in Drohobycz. His family was of distant Croatian extraction; he was a cousin of the Croatian politician Vladko Maček.

==Education==
After graduating from the grammar school at Drohobycz in 1910, he attended the philosophy faculty of Lwów University where he studied Polish philology (i.e. language and literature). Among his tutors were the renowned Polish philologists and Józef Kallenbach, He also attended lectures by Kazimierz Twardowski. During his studies he served in the Strzelec paramilitary organization, in which he received basic military training. After the outbreak of World War I, Maczek interrupted his studies, hoping to join Józef Piłsudski&#x27;s Polish Legions, but instead was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian Army.

==World War I==
After receiving a brief officer training, Maczek was sent to the Italian Front of World War I. Initially an NCO in the Tyrolean Regiment of the Imperial and Royal Army, he was promoted to second lieutenant in 1916 and then in 1918 to lieutenant. As the only Polish battalion commander in Austria-Hungary&#x27;s Alpine regiments, Maczek gained experience in mountain warfare, which proved valuable in his later career.

==Poland&#x27;s borders==
On 11 November 1918, after receiving news of the Armistice, Maczek disbanded his battalion and returned to the newly reborn Poland. Three days later he arrived at Krosno, where he joined the Polish Army. Assigned the command of a Krosno battalion, Maczek began a limited offensive against the forces of the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic (ZUNR) with the aim of relieving his besieged hometown. However, due to insufficient support, after initial successes at Ustrzyki, Chyrów and Felsztyn, the Polish offensive got bogged down and the Polish–Ukrainian War turned into trench warfare for the rest of the winter.

In April 1919 Maczek was withdrawn from his unit and became the organizer and commander of the so-called &#x27;flying&#x27; company (&quot;&quot;) as part of Gen. Aleksandrowicz&#x27;s 4th Infantry Division. This unit, created on Maczek&#x27;s initiative, was modelled after the German &quot;Sturmbataillone&quot; of World War I and was highly mobile, with horse-drawn vehicles (in the singular, &quot;taczanka&quot;, &quot;podwoda&quot;) from Austrian Army depots, and well-equipped with heavy machine guns. The unit was formed mostly from battle-hardened troops of the Krosno battalion, and its combat value was well above the average of the Polish Army of the time. Hence it served in a &quot;firefighter&quot; capacity, plugging holes that appeared in defensive lines, but also fighting with distinction in the Polish spring offensive. It took part in some of the heaviest fighting of the war, including the battles for Drohobycz, Stanisławów, Buczacz, and finally the ZUNR capital, Stryj.

After the end of the Polish–Ukrainian fighting, Maczek was confirmed in the rank of major with seniority from 1 June 1919. He was then attached to General &#x27;s Polish 2nd Army as a staff officer. Bored with staff duties, Maczek repeatedly asked his superiors to give him command over a front-line unit. His wish was fulfilled only after the start of the Polish–Bolshevik War, when the 2nd Army suffered a defeat in initial clashes with Semyon Budyonny&#x27;s 1st Cavalry Army. In Jarosław, Maczek formed a new &#x27;flying&#x27; rifle battalion, mostly composed of fresh recruits and horseless uhlans. Despite insufficient training, the unit was moved to the front and Maczek again acted as a &quot;firefighter&quot;, moving his unit quickly to wherever it was needed. His unit covered the retreat of the Polish forces at Mosty Wielkie, after which it was attached to Gen. Juliusz Rómmel&#x27;s 1st Cavalry Division. It took part in the Polish assault on Waręż near Zamość, a tactical counter-assault on the rear of Budyonny&#x27;s advancing Cossacks directly preceding the victorious battle of Komarów. After the end of hostilities, Maczek&#x27;s battalion was officially named after him, although it was disbanded shortly after the signing of the treaty of Riga.

==Interwar years==
Maczek decided not to resume his studies at Lwów University and remained in active service. Between 1921 and 1923 he commanded an infantry battalion within the Lwów-based 26th Infantry Regiment. On 1 August 1923 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and sent to the Higher Military School in Warsaw. He graduated the following year and served until 1927 as head of Section II (intelligence) in Lwów. Later that year he moved to Grodno, where he became deputy commander of the 76th Infantry Regiment. In 1929, after finishing his training, he became commander of the Grodno-based 81st Infantry Regiment, holding that post until 1934. During that time, on 1 January 1931, he was promoted to colonel. In 1935 he was transferred to Częstochowa, where he became commander of infantry (practically, deputy commander of the whole division) in the 7th Infantry Division.

In October 1938 Maczek&#x27;s experience as a commander of &quot;flying&quot; troops received recognition from his superiors, and he was given command of the Polish 10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade, the first fully motorized formation in the Polish Army.

==World War II==

===September 1939===
On the outbreak of war in September 1939, the 10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade was attached to the Kraków Army defending Lesser Poland and Silesia. Equipped with only light tanks and tankettes and with only one artillery battery of just eight heavy cannons, the brigade went into battle on the first day of war. After the Battle of Jordanów, Maczek&#x27;s unit faced the entire German XVIII Corps of Gen. Eugen Beyer and successfully shielded the southern flank of the Polish forces, along the Beskids. Supported by only a few battalions of Border Guards and National Defence troops, Maczek&#x27;s motorized brigade faced two Panzer divisions (4th Light Division under von Hubicki and 2nd Panzer Division under Veiel), as well as the 3rd Mountain Division under Eduard Dietl.

For five days Maczek&#x27;s brigade fought bravely and efficiently, slowing the pace of the German &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot; to a bloody crawl: despite numerical and technical superiority, the Germans were unable to make more than 10 kilometres headway per day. Maczek&#x27;s men took maximum advantage of the mountainous terrain, halting many German attacks and occasionally counter-attacking. However, after the front of the Kraków Army was broken to the north of the brigade&#x27;s position, Maczek&#x27;s formation was pulled out of the front line.

The brigade then fought as a screening unit, defending the bridges and fords in Lesser Poland, until it arrived at Lwów and joined the city&#x27;s defences. It formed a mobile reserve during the battle for Lwów, allowing other Polish units to withdraw towards the Romanian Bridgehead. However, the plan was made obsolete by the invasion of Poland by the Soviet Union on 17 September. After two days, Marshal of Poland Edward Rydz-Śmigły ordered the brigade to cross the Hungarian border. Maczek&#x27;s brigade was interned in Hungary. Although the unit had lost about half of its men, it had not been defeated in open combat, and therefore gained respect even from the enemy. It is considered to be the only Polish unit not to have lost a single battle in 1939. Maczek was not only esteemed by his superiors but also loved by his soldiers, who referred to him as &quot;&quot;, a traditional Polish highlanders&#x27; name for a shepherd.

===France, 1940===
After the end of the September campaign Maczek made it to France, where he joined the re-created Polish Army and was promoted to the rank of brigadier-general. He was made the commanding officer of the Polish military camp in Coëtquidan. He then prepared a detailed report on the workings of German &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot; tactics, and possible precautions against it. This report was, however, completely disregarded by the French general staff (the Germans captured it – unopened). He also started gathering any 10th Brigade veterans who had reached France in two camps in Paimpont and Campeneac. His aim was to preserve the integrity of his former unit and prevent the conscription of some of the best-trained Polish soldiers into standard infantry formations, where their experience would probably have been wasted. However, the French command was initially not interested in the formation of a Polish armoured unit and the Polish 10th Armoured Cavalry Brigade received almost no equipment. It was not until March 1940 that Maczek received a dozen obsolete FT-17 tanks for training, plus a few dozen cars and motorcycles.

Everything changed when Germany invaded France in the spring of 1940, by simply bypassing the Maginot Line. General Maczek&#x27;s unit suddenly received all the equipment it requested, under one condition: they had to go into action immediately. That proved impossible, because many of Polish soldiers had no experience with the new French equipment and there was no time for training exercises. General Maczek decided instead to lead a small force of his best-trained men, hoping that the rest of his unit would join them later. That small force was called the 10th Armoured Cavalry Brigade (&quot;&quot;) in honour of the &quot;Black Brigade&quot; from 1939. On 6 June, 10th Brigade had one tank battalion, two strong motorized cavalry squadrons, one anti-tank battery and one anti-aircraft battery. It was attached to the French 4th Army near Reims and ordered to cover its left flank. However, Maczek&#x27;s unit was much too weak to achieve success against German armoured divisions. Polish soldiers managed to cover only one retreating French infantry division by attacking German forces in Champaubert-Montgivroux. Later the brigade had to withdraw with the rest of the French troops and joined the French XXIII Corps. On 16 June the brigade attacked by night the town of Montbard over the Burgundy Canal. Maczek&#x27;s soldiers achieved complete surprise and took many German prisoners.

However, by then the brigade was fighting alone, with the French units on both flanks either routed or in retreat. There were no French forces to take advantage of that victory and the decimated Polish unit found itself surrounded and without fuel. On 18 June, Maczek decided to destroy unusable equipment and withdraw on foot. Later that day he had to split the remnants of his brigade into small groups, so they could pass through the enemy lines. Many of Maczek&#x27;s men, including the general himself, found their way through Vichy France, North Africa and Portugal to the United Kingdom, where a Polish armored unit was recreated, while others joined the Polish and French resistance organizations in France and Belgium. Maczek relocated to London. 

===Scotland===
Initially, the British high command wanted to use the recreated Polish Army solely for defence of the Scottish coastline between Aberdeen and Edinburgh, and the veterans of the Polish tank formations who arrived to the UK were pressed into the Polish 2nd Rifle Brigade under General Rudolf Orlicz-Dreszer. However, immediately on Maczek&#x27;s arrival the idea was abandoned and General Władysław Sikorski managed to persuade the British government to create instead a Polish armoured unit. After two years of training at the Blairgowrie training ground, in February 1942 General Maczek formed the 1st Polish Armoured Division. Initially serving in defence of the Scottish coast between Montrose and the Firth of Forth, the division was equipped by the British authorities with Churchill and M4 Sherman tanks in preparation for the Normandy landings.

===To Germany===
Towards the end of July 1944 the Polish 1st Armoured Division was transferred to Normandy, where it was to prove its worth during the 1944 invasion of Normandy. Attached to the First Canadian Army, Maczek&#x27;s men entered combat on 8 August, seeing service during Operation Totalize. The division twice suffered attacks of friendly fire from U.S. Army Air Force aircraft, yet achieved a brilliant victory against the Wehrmacht in the battles for Mont Ormel, Hill 262 and the town of Chambois. In this series of offensive and defensive operations, which came to be known as the Battle of Falaise, 14 German Wehrmacht and SS divisions were trapped in the huge Chambois pocket and destroyed. Maczek&#x27;s division had the crucial role of closing the pocket to block the escape route of the German divisions.

After this decisive battle, Maczek&#x27;s Division continued to spearhead the Allied drive across the battlefields of northern France, Belgium, the Netherlands and finally Germany. During its progress it liberated Ypres, Oostnieuwkerke, Roeselare, Tielt, Ruislede and Ghent in Belgium. (Coincidentally, the Polish word &quot;maczek&quot; means &quot;poppy&quot; in English, the symbol of remembrance associated with the area around Ypres in the First World War.) Thanks to an outflanking manoeuvre, it proved possible to free Breda in the Netherlands after a hard fight but without incurring losses in the town&#x27;s population. A petition on behalf of 40,000 inhabitants of Breda resulted in Maczek being made an honorary Dutch citizen after the war. The Division&#x27;s finest hour came when its forces accepted the surrender of the German naval base of Wilhelmshaven, taking captive the entire garrison, together with some 200 vessels of Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;.

Maczek commanded the 1st Armoured Division until the end of European hostilities and was promoted to major-general. After the capitulation of Germany he went on to command the Polish I Corps and became commanding officer of all Polish forces in the United Kingdom until their demobilization in 1947.

==Exile==

After the war, Maczek was stripped of Polish citizenship by the Communist government of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic, and thus had to remain in Britain. He left the army on 9 September 1948 but was denied a general&#x27;s pension by the British government as he had not been a member of the British armed forces. As a result, Maczek worked as a barman at an Edinburgh hotel until the 1960s.

Although living in the United Kingdom, General Stanisław Maczek had a strong connection to the Netherlands. Besides being a regional hero to the areas he liberated in World War II, he was awarded honorary citizenship of the city of Breda. Recently acquired archive documents show that the Polish general secretly received a yearly allowance from the Dutch government, for the rest of his life. He got his allowance, because Mayor Claudius Prinsen of Breda was worried in 1950, after receiving information that Maczek was in a &#x27;difficult financial situation&#x27;. The Polish general was doing unskilled labor to make ends meet. He also had to take care of a chronically ill daughter who needed costly treatment.

The mayor of Breda informed the Dutch national government that a war hero was in financial need. He made an appeal to the government to help the man that liberated the Netherlands. The government decided quickly and awarded Maczek an indexed general&#x27;s pension, which was paid for by the Ministry of Foreign affairs from a secret budget. The Dutch government did not want this to be made public, due to its sensitive nature. In the Cold War period, announcing that the Dutch were paying a non-communist Polish ex-general, would certainly strain diplomatic relations with the communist Polish government and the Soviet Union. Not to mention, it would confront the British government with a not so proud moment in their history. Uninformed about his improved financial situation, the Dutch public responded at once in 1965 when news came that his chronically ill daughter needed costly medical treatment in Spain. The Dutch population raised a substantial amount of money following a national radio broadcast for the Maczek family, helping out the general that liberated them.

In 1972 an appeal was made by the &quot;Poolse Katholieke Vereniging in Nederland&quot; to the Dutch Parliament. This organization became the voice for the remaining Polish veterans in the Netherlands and asked for compensation of pension lost due to the aftermath of the war. The Dutch Ministry of Defence did not meet this request, based upon the &quot;Algemene Militaire Pensioenwet&quot; (1966), which stipulates that non-Dutch persons needed to have been associated with the Dutch Armed Forces during the war period, in order to be entitled to a wartime pension.

In 1989, the last Polish Communist Government of Prime Minister Mieczysław Rakowski issued a public apology to the General, and in 1994 he was presented with Poland&#x27;s highest state decoration, the Order of the White Eagle.

Lieutenant General Stanisław Maczek died on 11 December 1994, at the age of 102. According to his last wish, he was laid to rest among his soldiers at the Polish military cemetery in Breda, the Netherlands. Next to the cemetery the Maczek Memorial Breda was opened in 2020. Each year during Liberation Day festivities, Breda is visited by a large Polish contingent and the city devotes part of the festivities to the fallen Polish soldiers.

Many artefacts and memorabilia belonging to Maczek and the 1st Polish Armoured Division are on display in the Polish Institute and Sikorski Museum in London.

In 2018 a bronze statue was unveiled in honour of General Maczek in the quadrangle of the Edinburgh City Chambers. A footpath crossing Bruntsfield Links which leads to the general&#x27;s former home in Arden Street in Marchmont, has been named General Maczek Walk.

==In popular culture==
Maczek, as the leader of the 10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade, is a historical figure in the novel &quot;A Witness to Gallantry: An American Spy in Poland 1939&quot;.

In &quot;The Death of the Fronsac&quot; by Neal Ascherson, a Polish officer, Maurycy Szczucki, serves with General Maczek in World War II. After the war, Szczucki returns to Edinburgh where he discovers the impoverished Maczek working as a barman in the Learmonth Hotel. The General is frequently visited by old comrades, who &quot;salute him before they order a whisky.&quot;

Maczek is referred to in Alexander McCall Smith&#x27;s short story, &quot;In Sandy Bell&#x27;s&quot;. The protagonist&#x27;s landlady tells of the general working in a bar in Edinburgh. &quot;He wasn&#x27;t too proud. His men saluted him when they ordered a drink.&quot;

<doc id="337178" wikidata="Q1227514" url="?curid=337178" title="Directoire style">
<text>Directoire style () was a period in the decorative arts, fashion, and especially furniture design in France concurrent with the Directory (November 2, 1795–November 10, 1799), the later part of the French Revolution. The style uses Neoclassical architectural forms, minimal carving, planar expanses of highly grained veneers, and applied decorative painting. It is a style transitional between Louis XVI and Empire.

The Directoire style was primarily established by the architects and designers Charles Percier (1764–1838) and Pier François Léonard Fontaine (1762–1853). In its use of Neoclassical architectural form and decorative motifs the style anticipates the slightly later and more elaborate Empire style, which was introduced after Napoleon established the First French Empire.

The Directoire style reflected the Revolutionary belief in the values of republican Rome: &quot;The stoic virtues of Republican Rome were upheld as standards not merely for the arts but also for political behaviour and private morality. &quot;Conventionels&quot; saw themselves as antique heroes. Children were named after Brutus, Solon and Lycurgus. The festivals of the Revolution were staged by Jacques-Louis David as antique rituals. Even the chairs in which the committee of &quot;Salut Publique&quot; sat were made on antique models devised by David... In fact Neo-classicism became fashionable&quot;.

==Furniture== 

The sources of inspiration are Etruscan, Roman and Louis XVI style. The main decorative motifs are: classical vases, carved urns, arrows, winged lions, dragons, mermaids, female busts and sphinxes.

<text>Mr. Met is the official mascot for Major League Baseball&#x27;s New York Mets. Mr. Met first appeared in 1963 as a cartoon drawing in programs. When the team moved to Shea Stadium the following year, he came to life in the form of a costumed mascothe is believed to be the first Major League Baseball mascot to appear in human form.

Mr. Met is a man with a large baseball for a head. He can be seen at Citi Field during Mets home games, has appeared in several commercials as part of ESPN&#x27;s This is &quot;SportsCenter&quot; campaign, and has been elected into the Mascot Hall of Fame. In 2012, &quot;Forbes&quot; Magazine listed Mr. Met as the number one mascot in all of sports.

==History==

Mr. Met was first introduced on the cover of game programs, yearbooks, and on scorecards in 1963, when the Mets were still playing at the Polo Grounds in northern Manhattan. Comic book artist Al Avison was at least one of the artists who contributed to the character&#x27;s design. When the Mets moved to Shea Stadium in 1964, fans were introduced to a live costumed version, portrayed by team ticket office employee, Daniel J. Reilly. Mr. Met is believed to have been the first mascot in Major League Baseball to exist in live-action (as opposed to artistically rendered) form. He was also the first person on the Mets to be represented by a bobblehead doll.

In the 1960s, Mr. Met occasionally appeared in print with a female companion, Mrs. Met (originally called &quot;Lady Met&quot;), and less frequently with a group of three &quot;little Mets&quot; children; the smallest was a baby in Lady Met&#x27;s arms. Mrs. Met was debuted in a short lived live costumed form in 1975 before being reintroduced in 2013.

In the mid-1970s, the Mets franchise began to abandon the Mr. Met mascot. In 1976, he appeared on the cover of the New York Mets Official Yearbook. In 1977 and 1978, Mr. Met and Lady Met appeared on the cover of the Mets Shea Stadium Official Schedule. After that time, he was not utilized in their advertising and he remained absent for almost 20 years. He was phased out prior to the upsurge in mascot popularity caused by The Famous Chicken and the Phillie Phanatic in the late &#x27;70s. In 1979, after the Mets discontinued use of Mr. Met, the team briefly experimented with a new mascot named &quot;Mettle the mule&quot; that was a living animal that would parade along the foul lines prior to a game.

In 1992, long time Mets fan, Lois Kaufmann of Queens, New York, wrote a compelling appeal for his reinstatement and asking the Mets to resurrect the mascot. The team did not act quickly or grant Lois her request to &quot;be&quot; Mr. Met. However, in 1994, they did follow her advice and revived Mr. Met as part of a promotion with Nickelodeon. After a long absence, Mr. Met was quickly re-embraced by New York Mets fans and has since remained a constant part of the franchise.
On April 14, 2002, the Mets held a birthday party for Mr. Met at Shea Stadium. It was attended by costumed mascots from all around Major League Baseball and by Sandy the Seagull, mascot of the Brooklyn Cyclones, a Mets farm team.

In the 2003 season, first baseman Tony Clark was the first Mets player ever to wear #00, Mr. Met&#x27;s number. In June of that season, he switched to #52 when Queens schoolchildren asked him what had happened to Mr. Met.

On September 14, 2007, Mr. Met was elected into the Mascot Hall of Fame.

Beginning on August 14, 2009, throughout their series against the San Francisco Giants, the Mets wore throwback jerseys featuring a Mr. Met patch on the right sleeve.

Currently, Mr. Met can be seen at Citi Field during and after games. He is usually found near Mr. Met&#x27;s Kiddie Field where fans can meet and pose for pictures with him. He can be hired for special events and private parties. Mr. Met is also featured on &quot;Mets Money&quot;, which are $1, $5 and $10 denomination gift certificates accepted at concession stands and souvenir shops at Citi Field. The design is somewhat reminiscent of standard U.S. currency, but instead features images of Mr. Met attired and posed similarly to the historical official (Washington, Lincoln or Hamilton) featured on the respective bill.

The second version of the Mr. Met head is now on display at the New York Mets Hall of Fame and Museum at Citi Field. 

In 2013, the Mets introduced batting practice caps featuring Mr. Met on the front. In 2014, a Mr. Met sleeve patch was featured on the Mets&#x27; blue alternate home and road jerseys. In 2015, a far more detailed Mr. Met backstory was written by a longtime fan in cooperation with the team and published by Mascot Books.

==Performers==
Mr. Met has been portrayed by many people over the years. Dan Reilly was the first person to wear the Mr. Met costume, starting in 1964. In 2007, Reilly wrote a book about his experiences with the team, called &quot;The Original Mr. Met Remembers&quot;.

Mr. Met was portrayed from 1994 through 1997 by AJ Mass, currently a fantasy sports writer for ESPN. Mass has written several books and articles on his experiences portraying Mr. Met. 

Matt Golden portrayed Mr. Met from 1999 to 2011.

On May 31, 2017, Mr. Met was heading back to the clubhouse after a Mets loss when he engaged in a heated exchange with an opposing fan. The argument ended with Mr. Met giving the finger towards the fan, which was caught on video. The Mets then changed performers for Mr. Met.

==Inside Baseball==
In a 2003 This is SportsCenter ad, when the show ends, everyone rushes out of the studio, creating a massive traffic jam. It then shows Mr. Met and Lady Met driving home on the freeway (with the Met children in the back), with Lady Met subtitled as saying they were glad to get out early. The New York Mets theme song, &quot;Meet the Mets&quot;, is on their car radio. (A shorter version with just the Mets family has Mrs. Met accusing Mr. Met of making eyes at one of the female ESPN sportscasters.)

In 2009, Mr. Met appeared in another This is SportsCenter ad, which Mr. Met is talking with Stuart Scott at a microwave. When Josh Hamilton shows up to use the microwave, Mr. Met angrily gestures at him and walks away. Hamilton is confused until Scott reveals that some of the balls Hamilton hit in the 2008 Home Run Derby were actually relatives of the mascot.

In 2007, Mr. Met became a spokesman for MTA New York City Transit, appearing on several advertisements and safety messages within the New York City Subways and buses.

He was also featured in commercials for &quot;MLB 06: The Show&quot;, a video game for Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 2, where a camera crew followed him around as he performed his daily duties, such as buying coffee and picking up his laundry. In 2010, he began appearing in commercials for Citi Bank that aired during Mets broadcasts, inducing Mets fans to join him in a &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Mets&quot; cheer during mundane activities such as business meetings.

He has his own Build-A-Bear Workshop store, but instead of at Citi Field, it&#x27;s located at the Mets&#x27; flagship store on Manhattan&#x27;s Fifth Avenue.

Mr. Met was featured on the remake of &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;. In it Oscar Madison was to throw out the first pitch. His estranged father (Garry Marshall) is with him and the senior Madison gets Oscar so mad that he hits Mr. Met in the head. The Mets get Oscar to, as a publicity stunt, apologize to Mr. Met.

In 2019, Mr. Met appeared in an episode of &quot;Madam Secretary&quot;. Newly elected President Elizabeth McCord, anxious about throwing a ceremonial pitch at a Mets game, dreams she knocks out Mr. Met instead.

Mr. Met and the Phillie Phanatic did a MasterCard commercial in 2013 to raise money for ending cancer. According to his 2019 Topps Opening Day Baseball Card, the &quot;hustling humanoid [still] loves getting selfies taken with fans and raising money for charitable causes.&quot;

<text>Cinderella (, &quot;Zolushka&quot;; ) Op. 87, is a ballet composed by Sergei Prokofiev to a scenario by Nikolai Volkov. It is one of his most popular and melodious compositions, and has inspired a great many choreographers since its inception. The piece was composed between 1940 and 1944. Part way through writing it Prokofiev broke off to write his opera &quot;War and Peace&quot;. The premiere of &quot;Cinderella&quot; was conducted by Yuri Fayer on 21 November, 1945, at the Bolshoi Theatre, with choreography by Rostislav Zakharov and Galina Ulanova in the title role. &quot;Cinderella&quot; is notable for its jubilant music, lush scenery, and for the comic double-roles of the stepmother and the two stepsisters (which can be performed in travesti), more mad than bad in this treatment.

==Story==

Act I

Cinderella, a young woman whose domineering stepmother forces her to act as a servant in her own home, helps her stepmother and two stepsisters to prepare for the Spring Ball, at which it is rumoured that the Prince will choose his bride-to-be. As the two stepsisters work together to produce a new shawl, they get into an argument over who will wear it, and end up tearing it in two through their bickering. The pair storm off, while the step-mother orders Cinderella to clear up the remnants and finish her chores, as her father returns home from business. Since her father&#x27;s remarriage, Cinderella has had to sleep by the kitchen fireplace, leaving her nothing to wear but rags covered in ashes. Her father has never moved past the grief of his first wife&#x27;s death, and though he is concerned for his only daughter Cinderella, he is just as much under the stepmother&#x27;s control as Cinderella herself is. Their brief peace is interrupted, however, as the stepmother and the two stepsisters reenter and begin ordering them about. During supper, a beggar woman turns up, asking for shelter. The two stepsisters and the stepmother try to chase her off, but Cinderella offers her a place by the kitchen fire and an old pair of slippers. The beggar thanks her for her kindness and departs, leaving the preparations for the ball to resume. After choosing dresses and a quick dancing lesson, the family finally sets off for the night with the father reluctantly in tow, leaving Cinderella behind.

Although lonely at first, she cheers herself up by dancing with her broom, imagining the Prince himself has asked her for a dance. She is surprised, however, when the old beggar woman appears out of nowhere, wishing to return the slippers with her thanks. To Cinderella&#x27;s amazement, the shoes have been transformed into dancing slippers of glass. The old beggar woman throws off her disguise and reveals herself as Cinderella&#x27;s fairy godmother, come to grant her wish of going to the ball. Summoning the fairies of Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter for assistance, she turns Cinderella&#x27;s rags into a beautiful dress, a pumpkin and mice into a carriage and horses, and grasshoppers and dragonflies into a retinue of footmen. As she is about to leave, however, the fairy godmother warns her that the magic will only last until midnight, at which time the spell will break, and everything will revert to its original form. Only the glass slippers will remain as a gift for her kindness. She then summons twelve dwarfs, who will appear to repeat her message if she has not left by midnight. With this warning in mind, Cinderella departs for the ball.

Act II

The Spring Ball is in full swing, with guests arriving from all over the kingdom and beyond to dance and pay respect to the Prince. The two stepsisters attempt to win favour with the royal court by showing off their dancing skills, but have less than successful results, much to their mother&#x27;s dismay. The Prince then joins the celebrations, but finding state events such as the Spring Ball dull, and being reluctant to enter a marriage without love, he declines any offers for a dance, particularly in the case of the obnoxious step-sisters.
Cinderella arrives at the palace, transformed beyond recognition into a beautifully dressed princess. The Prince, along with everyone else, is entranced by her beauty and charm, and for the first time, he asks for a dance. As the evening passes, Cinderella quickly becomes beloved by the entire court for her graciousness and charm, and the enamoured Prince spends the entire evening by her side. When refreshments are served, he gives her the honour of taking one of three oranges, a delicacy imported to the kingdom from a far-off land. Cinderella offers the other two oranges to her two stepsisters, who are so flattered by the attention that they do not recognize the beautiful stranger as their stepsister. The Prince takes Cinderella out to the royal gardens for an evening walk, where they dance and proclaim the love blossoming between them.

As they return to the ballroom for the next waltz, Cinderella has completely forgotten about the time in her happiness. However, at the first stroke of midnight, the twelve dwarfs spring from the great palace clock and remind Cinderella of her fairy godmother&#x27;s warning. Terrified of being unmasked as a lowly servant in rags, she flees from the ballroom to the astonishment of the other guests. Though the Prince pursues her, she vanishes into the night moments before the spell breaks, losing one of her glass slippers in her haste and panic. The Prince is heartbroken at the thought of losing his love so soon after discovering her, but upon finding the lost slipper, he vows not to rest until he is once again reunited with her.

Act III

The morning after the ball, the Prince summons every shoemaker in the kingdom, in order to find out who the slipper was made for. However, none of them claim to have crafted the shoe, or sold it to anybody recently, and he concludes that the princess must be from a foreign land. His desperate search brings him first to the Mediterranean, then to the Orient, and lands further beyond. After travelling across the world and meeting various beautiful princesses with no success, the Prince begins to search his own kingdom, trying the slipper on every maiden who attended the ball.

Back at Cinderella&#x27;s home, love has allowed the Prince to defy the laws of time and space; though she is only awakening the morning after the ball, he has already traveled the world and back again in search of his lost love. Upon waking, Cinderella initially believes that the events of the previous night were only a dream. As she relives some of the dances of the ball, she discovers the remaining glass slipper and realizes that it was all true. At breakfast, the two stepsisters reminisce about the ball, and argue about who made the greater impression on the Prince at the ball. Their fighting is interrupted when the father and the stepmother hurry in with the news that the Prince is on his way to their house, desperately trying a glass slipper on every girl he encounters. Upon his arrival, he tries the slipper on the two stepsisters, to no avail. The stepmother, however, demands to be given a chance and tries to force her foot into the shoe, ordering Cinderella to help her. As she bends down to assist, the remaining slipper falls from her pocket and the Prince finally recognizes Cinderella for who she is. As Cinderella successfully tries on both glass slippers, her stepfamily beg for her forgiveness, which she happily bestows upon them. Overjoyed to have rediscovered each other, Cinderella and the Prince are then transported away to a secret garden by the fairy godmother, where they confess their love for one another and are happily married.

<text>Thomas McGreevy (July 29, 1825 – January 2, 1897) was a Canadian politician and contractor.

Born in Quebec, he was the son of Robert McGreevy, a blacksmith, and Rose Smith. In 1867 he was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Quebec West (as a liberal conservative), and was re-elected in 1872, 1874, 1878, 1882, 1887 and 1891.

He was expelled from the House of Commons for corruption on September 29, 1891, and following his conviction for defrauding the government was sentenced to a year in prison. (The other MPs to be expelled from the Canadian House of Commons are Louis Riel [twice] and Quebec communist Fred Rose.) Following his release on March 1, 1894, he was re-elected to Parliament in 1895.

He was the contractor for the building of the Parliament of Canada.

He was married three times: to Mary Ann Rourke on July 13, 1857, to Bridget Caroline Nolan on February 4, 1861 and to Mary Georgina Woolsey on January 30, 1867. He had several children by Mary Georgina including Stella and Herbert. Mary Georgina Woolsey came from a wealthy Quebec family, now most famous for being the subject of William Berczy&#x27;s portrait of &quot;The Woolsey Family&quot; (1809).

<text>William von Moll Berczy (December 10, 1744 – February 5, 1813) was a German-born Upper Canada pioneer and painter. He is considered one of the co-founders of the Town of York, Upper Canada, now Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

==Biography==
Berczy was born in Wallerstein, Swabia, Electorate of Bavaria (part of the Holy Roman Empire and now in Germany) as a son of the &quot;Wirklicher Hofrat&quot; (Albrecht Theodor Moll) and Johanna Josepha Walpurga Moll (née Hefele). Berczy was originally named Johann Albrecht Ulrich Moll, but following marriage changed his name.

He studied at the Akademie der bildenden Künste in Vienna and at the University of Jena in Saxony. His early career was spent in several European countries, including Poland, Switzerland, and Italy. In 1792, Berczy sailed for the Americas, settling in Philadelphia, then setting up a business in York, Upper Canada (now Toronto). A few years later, his work took him to Lower Canada (Quebec).

Berczy married, on November 1, 1785, Jeanne-Charlotte Berczy née Allamand (1760–1839) of Lausanne (canton of Bern, now - since 1803 - canton of Vaud), Switzerland. They had two sons, William Bent Berczy and Charles Albert Berczy. His son Charles Albert Berczy became the second postmaster of Toronto.

Berczy helped John Graves Simcoe establish a settlement north of York, called German Mills with his migrants under the German Land Company, which later became the town of Markham.

Berczy built homes in York and Markham, including Russell Abbey in York.

Berczy painted. His two best-known pictures are a full-length portrait of the Mohawk chief Thayendanegea (Joseph Brant) () and a group portrait of the Woolsey Family (1809). Although best known for his portraits, he also carried out religious paintings and architectural work, including plans for Christ Church Cathedral in Montreal in 1803, and was a surveyor.

Berczy travelled to New York City during the War of 1812 and was stranded when attempting to travel. He first stayed in Middlebury, Vermont, with friends, then to Albany, New York, then to New York City from which he planned to travel to England. He fell ill while in New York and died while in the care of friends. He was buried in an unmarked grave at Trinity Church as William Burksay. His wife moved in with her son William and died on September 18, 1839, in Sainte-Mélanie, Lower Canada. Berczy was also survived by his other son, Charles Albert Berczy.

==Legacy==
An elementary school in central Markham(Unionville) is named William Berczy Public School in his honour. The school, founded in 1967, has approximately 600 students in grades K-8. Also in honour of this founder, the then Town of Markham named one of its densely populated neighbourhoods after him, the Berczy Village. Berczy Creek is a tributary of the Rouge River in Markham. A bronze statue of Berczy will be situated in at Berczy Square, a park to be built at Berczy Village near Kennedy Road and 16th Avenue in Markham. Within Berczy Village is William Berczy Settlement Historical Cemetery.

William Berczy Boulevard is a major road from Major Mackenzie Drive to 16th Avenue in Berczy Village, Berczy Gate is a short street near Highway 7 and Ninth Line and Berczy Creek Way is a short road near 16th Avenue and Warden Avenue in Markham. In Toronto a roadway called Leader Lane was renamed from Berczy Lane. There is also Berczy Street in Aurora running next to the train station.

Berczy Park is a small park located behind the Gooderham Building at Front Street and Wellington Street in Toronto, Ontario. The park had been vacant for many decades and once used as a parking lot after the buildings on the site were demolished. A tree-lined city park emerged after the late 1980s and has undergone renovations from 2015 to 2016.

Berczy Street Park and Berczy Street are found in Barrie, Ontario. Berczy-Strasse is a street named for him in Wallerstein, Bavaria.

In 2016, Berczy was named a National Historic Person.

===In fiction===
Berczy is the subject of John Steffler&#x27;s biographical novel &quot;German Mills: A Novel Pertaining to the Life and Times of William Berczy&quot; (Gaspereau Press, 2015).

<text>Neuroanatomy is the study of the structure and organization of the nervous system. In contrast to animals with radial symmetry, whose nervous system consists of a distributed network of cells, animals with bilateral symmetry have segregated, defined nervous systems. Their neuroanatomy is therefore better understood. In vertebrates, the nervous system is segregated into the internal structure of the brain and spinal cord (together called the central nervous system, or CNS) and the series of nerves that connect the CNS to the rest of the body (known as the peripheral nervous system, or PNS). Breaking down and identifying specific parts of the nervous system has been crucial for figuring out how it operates. For example, much of what neuroscientists have learned comes from observing how damage or &quot;lesions&quot; to specific brain areas affects behavior or other neural functions.

For information about the composition of non-human animal nervous systems, see nervous system. For information about the typical structure of the Homo sapiens nervous system, see human brain or peripheral nervous system. This article discusses information pertinent to the &quot;study&quot; of neuroanatomy.

== History ==

The first known written record of a study of the anatomy of the human brain is an ancient Egyptian document, the Edwin Smith Papyrus. In Ancient Greece, interest in the brain began with the work of Alcmaeon, who appeared to have dissected the eye and related the brain to vision. He also suggested that the brain, not the heart, was the organ that ruled the body (what Stoics would call the &quot;hegemonikon&quot;) and that the senses were dependent on the brain.

The debate regarding the &quot;hegemonikon&quot; persisted among ancient Greek philosophers and physicians for a very long time. Those who argued for the brain often contributed to the understanding of neuroanatomy as well. Herophilus and Erasistratus of Alexandria were perhaps the most influential with their studies involving dissecting human brains, affirming the distinction between the cerebrum and the cerebellum, and identifying the ventricles and the &quot;dura mater&quot;. The Greek physician and philosopher Galen, likewise, argued strongly for the brain as the organ responsible for sensation and voluntary motion, as evidenced by his research on the neuroanatomy of oxen, Barbary apes, and other animals.

The cultural taboo on human dissection continued for several hundred years afterward, which brought no major progress in the understanding of the anatomy of the brain or of the nervous system. However, Pope Sixtus IV effectively revitalized the study of neuroanatomy by altering the papal policy and allowing human dissection. This resulted in a flush of new activity by artists and scientists of the Renaissance, such as Mondino de Luzzi, Berengario da Carpi, and Jacques Dubois, and culminating in the work of Andreas Vesalius.

In 1664, Thomas Willis, a physician and professor at Oxford University, coined the term neurology when he published his text &quot;Cerebri Anatome&quot; which is considered the foundation of modern neuroanatomy. The subsequent three hundred and fifty some years has produced a great deal of documentation and study of the neural system.

== Composition ==
At the tissue level, the nervous system is composed of neurons, glial cells, and extracellular matrix. Both neurons and glial cells come in many types (see, for example, the nervous system section of the list of distinct cell types in the adult human body). Neurons are the information-processing cells of the nervous system: they sense our environment, communicate with each other via electrical signals and chemicals called neurotransmitters which generally act across synapses (close contacts between two neurons, or between a neuron and a muscle cell; note also extrasynaptic effects are possible, as well as release of neurotransmitters into the neural extracellular space), and produce our memories, thoughts, and movements. Glial cells maintain homeostasis, produce myelin (oligodendrocytes, Schwann cells), and provide support and protection for the brain&#x27;s neurons. Some glial cells (astrocytes) can even propagate intercellular calcium waves over long distances in response to stimulation, and release gliotransmitters in response to changes in calcium concentration. Wound scars in the brain largely contain astrocytes. The extracellular matrix also provides support on the molecular level for the brain&#x27;s cells, vehiculating substances to and from the blood vessels.

At the organ level, the nervous system is composed of brain regions, such as the hippocampus in mammals or the mushroom bodies of the fruit fly. These regions are often modular and serve a particular role within the general systemic pathways of the nervous system. For example, the hippocampus is critical for forming memories in connection with many other cerebral regions. The peripheral nervous system also contains afferent or efferent nerves, which are bundles of fibers that originate from the brain and spinal cord, or from sensory or motor sorts of peripheral ganglia, and branch repeatedly to innervate every part of the body. Nerves are made primarily of the axons or dendrites of neurons (axons in case of efferent motor fibres, and dendrites in case of afferent sensory fibres of the nerves), along with a variety of membranes that wrap around and segregate them into nerve fascicles.

The vertebrate nervous system is divided into the central and peripheral nervous systems. The central nervous system (CNS) consists of the brain, retina, and spinal cord, while the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is made up of all the nerves and ganglia (packets of peripheral neurons) outside of the CNS that connect it to the rest of the body. The PNS is further subdivided into the somatic and autonomic nervous systems. The somatic nervous system is made up of &quot;afferent&quot; neurons, which bring sensory information from the somatic (body) sense organs to the CNS, and &quot;efferent&quot; neurons, which carry motor instructions out to the voluntary muscles of the body. The autonomic nervous system can work with or without the control of the CNS (that&#x27;s why it is called &#x27;autonomous&#x27;), and also has two subdivisions, called sympathetic and parasympathetic, which are important for transmitting motor orders to the body&#x27;s basic internal organs, thus controlling functions such as heartbeat, breathing, digestion, and salivation. Autonomic nerves, unlike somatic nerves, contain only efferent fibers. Sensory signals coming from the viscera course into the CNS through the somatic sensory nerves (e.g., visceral pain), or through some particular cranial nerves (e.g., chemosensitive or mechanic signals).

=== Orientation in neuroanatomy ===

In anatomy in general and neuroanatomy in particular, several sets of topographic terms are used to denote orientation and location, which are generally referred to the body or brain axis (see Anatomical terms of location). The axis of the CNS is often wrongly assumed to be more or less straight, but it actually shows always two ventral flexures (cervical and cephalic flexures) and a dorsal flexure (pontine flexure), all due to differential growth during embryogenesis. The pairs of terms used most commonly in neuroanatomy are:

* Dorsal and ventral: Dorsal refers more or less to the top or upper side of the brain, which is symbolized by the floor plate, and ventral to the bottom or lower side. These descriptors originally were used for &quot;dorsum&quot; and &quot;ventrum&quot; – back and belly – of the body; the belly of most animals is oriented towards the ground; the erect posture of humans places our ventral aspect anteriorly, and the dorsal aspect becomes posterior. The case of the head and the brain is peculiar, since the belly does not properly extend into the head, unless we assume that the mouth represents an extended belly element. Therefore, in common use, those brain parts that lie close to the base of the cranium, and through it to the mouth cavity, are called ventral – i.e., at its bottom or lower side, as defined above – whereas dorsal parts are closer to the enclosing cranial vault. Reference to the roof and floor plates of the brain is less prone to confusion, also allow us to keep an eye on the axial flexures mentioned above. Dorsal and ventral are thus relative terms in the brain, whose exact meaning depends on the specific location.
* Rostral and caudal: &quot;rostral&quot; refers in general anatomy to the front of the body (towards the nose, or &quot;rostrum&quot; in Latin), and &quot;caudal&quot; refers to the tail end of the body (towards the tail; &quot;cauda&quot; in Latin). The rostrocaudal dimension of the brain corresponds to its length axis, which runs across the cited flexures from the caudal tip of the spinal cord into a rostral end roughly at the optic chiasma. In the erect Man, the directional terms &quot;superior&quot; and &quot;inferior&quot; essentially refer to this rostrocaudal dimension, because our body and brain axes are roughly oriented vertically in the erect position. However, all vertebrates develop a very marked ventral kink in the neural tube that is still detectable in the adult central nervous system, known as the cephalic flexure. The latter bends the rostral part of the CNS at a 180-degree angle relative to the caudal part, at the transition between the forebrain (axis ending rostrally at the optic chiasma) and the brainstem and spinal cord (axis roughly vertical, but including additional minor kinks at the pontine and cervical flexures) These flexural changes in axial dimension are problematic when trying to describe relative position and sectioning planes in the brain. There is abundant literature that wrongly disregards the axial flexures and assumes a relatively straight brain axis.
* Medial and lateral: &quot;medial&quot; refers to being close, or relatively closer, to the midline (the descriptor &quot;median&quot; means a position precisely at the midline). &quot;Lateral&quot; is the opposite (a position more or less separated away from the midline).
Note that such descriptors (dorsal/ventral, rostral/caudal; medial/lateral) are relative rather than absolute (e.g., a lateral structure may be said to lie medial to something else that lies even more laterally).

Commonly used terms for planes of orientation or planes of section in neuroanatomy are &quot;sagittal&quot;, &quot;transverse&quot; or &quot;coronal&quot;, and &quot;axial&quot; or &quot;horizontal&quot;. Again in this case, the situation is different for swimming, creeping or quadrupedal (prone) animals than for Man, or other erect species, due to the changed position of the axis. Due to the axial brain flexures, no section plane ever achieves a complete section series in a selected plane, because some sections inevitably result cut oblique or even perpendicular to it, as they pass through the flexures. Experience allows to discern the portions that result cut as desired.

* A mid-sagittal plane divides the body and brain into left and right halves; sagittal sections, in general, are parallel to this median plane, moving along the medial-lateral dimension (see the image above). The term &quot;sagittal&quot; refers etymologically to the median suture between the right and left parietal bones of the cranium, known classically as sagittal suture, because it looks roughly like an arrow by its confluence with other sutures (&quot;sagitta&quot;; arrow in Latin).
* A section plane orthogonal to the axis of any elongated form in principle is held to be transverse (e.g., a transverse section of a finger or of the vertebral column); if there is no length axis, there is no way to define such sections, or there are infinite possibilities. Therefore, transverse body sections in vertebrates are parallel to the ribs, which are orthogonal to the vertebral column, which represents the body axis both in animals and man. The brain also has an intrinsic longitudinal axis – that of the primordial elongated neural tube – which becomes largely vertical with the erect posture of Man, similarly as the body axis, except at its rostral end, as commented above. This explains that transverse spinal cord sections are roughly parallel to our ribs, or to the ground. However, this is only true for the spinal cord and the brainstem, since the forebrain end of the neural axis bends crook-like during early morphogenesis into the chiasmatic hypothalamus, where it ends; the orientation of true transverse sections accordingly changes, and is no longer parallel to the ribs and ground, but perpendicular to them; lack of awareness of this morphologic brain peculiarity (present in all vertebrate brains without exceptions) has caused and still causes much erroneous thinking on forebrain brain parts. Acknowledging the singularity of rostral transverse sections, tradition has introduced a different descriptor for them, namely &quot;coronal&quot; sections. Coronal sections divide the forebrain from rostral (front) to caudal (back), forming a series orthogonal (transverse) to the local bent axis. The concept cannot be applied meaningfully to the brainstem and spinal cord, since there the coronal sections become horizontal to the axial dimension, being parallel to the axis. In any case, the concept of &#x27;coronal&#x27; sections is less precise than that of &#x27;transverse&#x27;, since often coronal section planes are used which are not truly orthogonal to the rostral end of the brain axis. The term is etymologically related to the &quot;coronal suture&quot; of the craneum and this to the position where crowns are worn (Latin &quot;corona&quot; means crown). It is not clear what sort of crown was meant originally (maybe just a diadema), and this leads unfortunately to ambiguity in the section plane defined merely as coronal.
* A coronal plane across the human head and brain is modernly conceived to be parallel to the face (the plane in which a king&#x27;s crown sits on his head is not exactly parallel to the face, and exportation of the concept to less frontally endowed animals than us is obviously even more conflictive, but there is an implicit reference to the &quot;coronal suture&quot; of the cranium, which forms between the frontal and temporal/parietal bones, giving a sort of diadema configuration which is roughly parallel to the face). Coronal section planes thus essentially refer only to the head and brain, where a diadema makes sense, and not to the neck and body below.
* Horizontal sections by definition are aligned (parallel) with the horizon. In swimming, creeping and quadrupedal animals the body axis itself is horizontal, and, thus, horizontal sections run along the length of the spinal cord, separating ventral from dorsal parts. Horizontal sections are orthogonal to both transverse and sagittal sections, and in theory, are parallel to the length axis. Due to the axial bend in the brain (forebrain), true horizontal sections in that region are orthogonal to coronal (transverse) sections (as is the horizon relative to the face).

According to these considerations, the three directions of space are represented precisely by the sagittal, transverse and horizontal planes, whereas coronal sections can be transverse, oblique or horizontal, depending on how they relate to the brain axis and its incurvations.

== Tools ==
Modern developments in neuroanatomy are directly correlated to the technologies used to perform research. Therefore, it is necessary to discuss the various tools that are available. Many of the histological techniques used to study other tissues can be applied to the nervous system as well. However, there are some techniques that have been developed especially for the study of neuroanatomy.

=== Cell staining ===
In biological systems, staining is a technique used to enhance the contrast of particular features in microscopic images.

Nissl staining uses aniline basic dyes to intensely stain the acidic polyribosomes in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, which is abundant in neurons. This allows researchers to distinguish between different cell types (such as neurons and glia), and neuronal shapes and sizes, in various regions of the nervous system cytoarchitecture.

The classic Golgi stain uses potassium dichromate and silver nitrate to fill selectively with a silver chromate precipitate a few neural cells (neurons or glia, but in principle, any cells can react similarly). This so-called silver chromate impregnation procedure stains entirely or partially the cell bodies and neurites of some neurons -dendrites, axon- in brown and black, allowing researchers to trace their paths up to their thinnest terminal branches in a slice of nervous tissue, thanks to the transparency consequent to the lack of staining in the majority of surrounding cells. Modernly, Golgi-impregnated material has been adapted for electron-microscopic visualization of the unstained elements surrounding the stained processes and cell bodies, thus adding further resolutive power.

=== Histochemistry ===
Histochemistry uses knowledge about biochemical reaction properties of the chemical constituents of the brain (including notably enzymes) to apply selective methods of reaction to visualize where they occur in the brain and any functional or pathological changes. This applies importantly to molecules related to neurotransmitter production and metabolism, but applies likewise in many other directions chemoarchitecture, or chemical neuroanatomy.

Immunocytochemistry is a special case of histochemistry that uses selective antibodies against a variety of chemical epitopes of the nervous system to selectively stain particular cell types, axonal fascicles, neuropiles, glial processes or blood vessels, or specific intracytoplasmic or intranuclear proteins and other immunogenetic molecules, e.g., neurotransmitters. Immunoreacted transcription factor proteins reveal genomic readout in terms of translated protein. This immensely increases the capacity of researchers to distinguish between different cell types (such as neurons and glia) in various regions of the nervous system.

In situ hybridization uses synthetic RNA probes that attach (hybridize) selectively to complementary mRNA transcripts of DNA exons in the cytoplasm, to visualize genomic readout, that is, distinguish active gene expression, in terms of mRNA rather than protein. This allows identification histologically (in situ) of the cells involved in the production of genetically-coded molecules, which often represent differentiation or functional traits, as well as the molecular boundaries separating distinct brain domains or cell populations.

=== Genetically encoded markers ===
By expressing variable amounts of red, green, and blue fluorescent proteins in the brain, the so-called &quot;brainbow&quot; mutant mouse allows the combinatorial visualization of many different colors in neurons. This tags neurons with enough unique colors that they can often be distinguished from their neighbors with fluorescence microscopy, enabling researchers to map the local connections or mutual arrangement (tiling) between neurons.

Optogenetics uses transgenic constitutive and site-specific expression (normally in mice) of blocked markers that can be activated selectively by illumination with a light beam. This allows researchers to study axonal connectivity in the nervous system in a very discriminative way.

=== Non-invasive brain imaging ===
Magnetic resonance imaging has been used extensively to investigate brain structure and function non-invasively in healthy human subjects. An important example is diffusion tensor imaging, which relies on the restricted diffusion of water in tissue in order to produce axon images. In particular, water moves more quickly along the direction aligned with the axons, permitting the inference of their structure.

=== Viral-based methods ===
Certain viruses can replicate in brain cells and cross synapses. So, viruses modified to express markers (such as fluorescent proteins) can be used to trace connectivity between brain regions across multiple synapses. Two tracer viruses which replicate and spread transneuronal/transsynaptic are the Herpes simplex virus type1 (HSV) and the Rhabdoviruses. Herpes simplex virus was used to trace the connections between the brain and the stomach, in order to examine the brain areas involved in viscero-sensory processing. Another study injected herpes simplex virus into the eye, thus allowing the visualization of the optical pathway from the retina into the visual system. An example of a tracer virus which replicates from the synapse to the soma is the pseudorabies virus. By using pseudorabies viruses with different fluorescent reporters, dual infection models can parse complex synaptic architecture.

=== Dye-based methods ===
Axonal transport methods use a variety of dyes (horseradish peroxidase variants, fluorescent or radioactive markers, lectins, dextrans) that are more or less avidly absorbed by neurons or their processes. These molecules are selectively transported anterogradely (from soma to axon terminals) or retrogradely (from axon terminals to soma), thus providing evidence of primary and collateral connections in the brain. These &#x27;physiologic&#x27; methods (because properties of living, unlesioned cells are used) can be combined with other procedures, and have essentially superseded the earlier procedures studying degeneration of lesioned neurons or axons. Detailed synaptic connections can be determined by correlative electron microscopy.

=== Connectomics ===

Serial section electron microscopy has been extensively developed for use in studying nervous systems. For example, the first application of serial block-face scanning electron microscopy was on rodent cortical tissue. Circuit reconstruction from data produced by this high-throughput method is challenging, and the Citizen science game EyeWire has been developed to aid research in that area.

=== Computational neuroanatomy ===

Is a field that utilizes various imaging modalities and computational techniques to model and quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of neuroanatomical structures in both normal and clinical populations.

== Model systems ==
Aside from the human brain, there are many other animals whose brains and nervous systems have received extensive study as model systems, including mice, zebrafish, fruit fly, and a species of roundworm called &quot;C. elegans&quot;. Each of these has its own advantages and disadvantages as a model system. For example, the &quot;C. elegans&quot; nervous system is extremely stereotyped from one individual worm to the next. This has allowed researchers using electron microscopy to map the paths and connections of all of the 302 neurons in this species. The fruit fly is widely studied in part because its genetics is very well understood and easily manipulated. The mouse is used because, as a mammal, its brain is more similar in structure to our own (e.g., it has a six-layered cortex, yet its genes can be easily modified and its reproductive cycle is relatively fast).

=== &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot; ===
The brain is small and simple in some species, such as the nematode worm, where the body plan is quite simple: a tube with a hollow gut cavity running from the mouth to the anus, and a nerve cord with an enlargement (a ganglion) for each body segment, with an especially large ganglion at the front, called the brain. The nematode &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot; has been studied because of its importance in genetics. In the early 1970s, Sydney Brenner chose it as a model system for studying the way that genes control development, including neuronal development. One advantage of working with this worm is that the nervous system of the hermaphrodite contains exactly 302 neurons, always in the same places, making identical synaptic connections in every worm. Brenner&#x27;s team sliced worms into thousands of ultrathin sections and photographed every section under an electron microscope, then visually matched fibers from section to section, to map out every neuron and synapse in the entire body, to give a complete connectome of the nematode. Nothing approaching this level of detail is available for any other organism, and the information has been used to enable a multitude of studies that would not have been possible without it.

=== &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; ===

&quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; is a popular experimental animal because it is easily cultured en masse from the wild, has a short generation time, and mutant animals are readily obtainable.

Arthropods have a central brain with three divisions and large optical lobes behind each eye for visual processing. The brain of a fruit fly contains several million synapses, compared to at least 100 billion in the human brain. Approximately two-thirds of the &quot;Drosophila&quot; brain is dedicated to visual processing.

Thomas Hunt Morgan started to work with &quot;Drosophila&quot; in 1906, and this work earned him the 1933 Nobel Prize in Medicine for identifying chromosomes as the vector of inheritance for genes. Because of the large array of tools available for studying &quot;Drosophila&quot; genetics, they have been a natural subject for studying the role of genes in the nervous system. The genome has been sequenced and published in 2000. About 75% of known human disease genes have a recognizable match in the genome of fruit flies. &quot;Drosophila&quot; is being used as a genetic model for several human neurological diseases including the neurodegenerative disorders Parkinson&#x27;s, Huntington&#x27;s, spinocerebellar ataxia and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. In spite of the large evolutionary distance between insects and mammals, many basic aspects of &quot;Drosophila&quot; neurogenetics have turned out to be relevant to humans. For instance, the first biological clock genes were identified by examining &quot;Drosophila&quot; mutants that showed disrupted daily activity cycles.

<text>Razanne is a series of dolls designed and produced by Ammar Saadeh, a Palestinian expatriate living in Michigan, United States.

The dolls hit the consumer markets in 1996. Inspired by the American doll &quot;Barbie&quot;, &quot;Razanne&quot; is aimed, according to Saadeh, to help Muslim girls develop self-esteem and to dream. All Razanne dolls are equipped with hijab. The United States media already calls &quot;Razanne&quot; the &quot;Muslim Barbie&quot;. There are also some further toys and accessories featuring Razanne as a character including a colouring book.

Saadeh hopes the doll will sell well in countries such as Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, where it has been sold since 2004. The doll is expected to sell well in Saudi Arabia, where the doll also debuted in 2004.

Apart from sales in the United States, the dolls are also sold in the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany and Singapore.

Another current doll featuring a positive, but identifiably Islamic female character is the Fulla doll marketed in Saudi Arabia, Brazil, China, and Egypt. It is sold more profitably than Razanne.

<doc id="337198" wikidata="Q7552344" url="?curid=337198" title="Society of Actuaries">
<text>The Society of Actuaries (SOA) is a global professional organization for actuaries. It was founded in 1949 as the merger of two major actuarial organizations in the United States: the Actuarial Society of America and the American Institute of Actuaries. It is a full member organization of the International Actuarial Association.

Through education and research, the SOA promotes actuaries as leaders in the assessment and management of risk to enhance financial outcomes for individuals, organizations, and the public. The SOA&#x27;s vision is for actuaries to be highly sought-after professionals who develop and communicate solutions for complex financial issues. The SOA provides primary and continuing education for students and practicing actuaries, maintains high professional standards for actuaries, and conducts research on actuarial trends and public policy issues.

As a global organization, the SOA represents actuaries from all major areas of practice, including life and health insurance, retirement and pensions, investment and finance, enterprise risk management, and general insurance (property and casualty) insurance. The Casualty Actuarial Society also represents actuaries working with property and casualty.

==History==
The Society was founded as a merger of two major American actuarial associations, as reflected in its logo: the Actuarial Society of America and the American Institute of Actuaries.

The Actuarial Society of America was the first actuarial professional association in North America, founded in 1889 with only 38 members and headquartered in New York City. Initial members were included by invitation, but the organization soon adopted a system of examination for qualification, with the first Fellow to qualify via exams joining in 1900.

The American Institute of Actuaries was founded in 1909. Based in Chicago, it attracted members from life insurance companies in the midwestern and southern United States. The formation of the American Institute of Actuaries, which (like the Actuarial Society of America) was geared toward actuaries in the field of life insurance, was followed within the decade by the creation of two other specialized actuarial organizations: the Casualty Actuarial Society, which still exists today, and the Fraternal Actuarial Association, which dissolved in 1980.

Between the two organizations, which came to have some overlap in membership, the number of recognized professional actuaries climbed from the initial 38 to over 1,000 by the time the two organizations merged in 1949 to form the SOA. The SOA has seen continued growth since then, now recognizing over 30,000 professional actuaries as active members.

The SOA, along with its public relations firm Golin, won the &quot;PRWeek&quot; Corporate Branding Campaign of the Year award for 2008. The award was given for the SOA&#x27;s efforts to revitalize the actuarial profession&#x27;s brand in the U.S., including the slogan &quot;Risk is Opportunity. In 2024 SOA moved their headquarters to Rosemont, Illinois.

== Structure ==
=== Leadership ===
The SOA is headed by a board of directors, consisting of a president, president-elect, past president, and fifteen other board members. The employees of the SOA are headed by the chief executive officer, a salaried position appointed by the board of directors.

=== Elections ===
The board positions are filled by election. A member is eligible to vote in board elections if they are an FSA, or if they have been an ASA for at least five years. Only FSAs can be elected to the board.

The SOA holds its elections annually in late summer or early fall for its board of directors and the Section Councils. In the board of directors election, one president-elect, and five elected board members are elected. Elected board members serve three-year terms. The president-elect serves three one-year terms as president-elect, president, and past president.

In section elections, generally one-third of the council is elected each year as members serve three-year terms. Section councils select their officers (chair, vice chair, and secretary/treasurer).

According to the Section Bylaws, all members of a Section are entitled to vote in the Section Council election. This includes ASAs, FSAs, and members of co-sponsoring organizations who are also members of a Section. SOA members are emailed login credentials to vote online. Members without valid email addresses, or who notify the SOA of their request, receive paper ballots.

=== Membership ===
The SOA has more than 30,000 actuaries as members. The society&#x27;s members are involved in the life, health, pension, and general insurance areas of the actuarial profession. There are three classes of members. 

There are two designations offered by the SOA: the &quot;Associate of Society of Actuaries&quot; (ASA) and the &quot;Fellow of the Society of Actuaries&quot; (FSA). The SOA also issues one credential: the &quot;Chartered Enterprise Risk Analyst&quot; (CERA), which was introduced in 2007. The three micro-credentials (Pre-Actuarial Foundations, Actuarial Science Foundations, and Data Science for Actuaries) were introduced in 2022 along with affiliate membership.

Requirements for membership for the SOA include writing actuarial exams, a comprehensive series of competitive exams. Topics covered in the exams include mathematics, finance, insurance, economics, interest theory, life models, and actuarial science. Non-members working in the actuarial profession and taking exams are often referred to as actuarial students or candidates.

Members of the SOA who meet a professional experience requirement are eligible for membership in the American Academy of Actuaries, which represents United States actuaries from all practice areas.

== Education system ==
Professional designations of ASA or FSA are earned by completing a rigorous education system including examinations, courses, and e-learning modules. It is common for actuarial students to work full-time in the profession while studying for the exams.

=== Exams towards associateship ===
The associateship exams, commonly called preliminary exams, consist mostly of core mathematics related to actuarial science including probability, interest theory, life contingencies, risk models, statistical modeling, and predictive analytics. 
Preliminary exams are administered on computers at Prometric testing centers. The scores are reported on a scale of 0 to 10. The score is relative to the actual passing percentage formula_1.

The highest achievable grade for some exams can be 9. If formula_2, then formula_3, i.e. the requirement for a score of 10 is higher than formula_4.

The current form of preliminary exams were established in year 2000 and evolved over time. In 2018 and 2023, the preliminary exams have undergone another wave of significant changes to reflect an emphasis on predictive analytics, and also provides a curriculum balance between long-term and short-term insurance coverages. The rough equivalent of preliminary exams since year 2000 are listed according to the transition rules published by SOA. There are also differences in detail between exam syllabi over time.
=== Other components toward associateship ===
In addition to the exams, candidates also need to complete Validation by Educational Experience (VEE), a series of e-learning modules, and the Associateship Professionalism Course (APC).
In 2000, candidates may be admitted to associateship by completing Course 5 (Application of Basic Actuarial Principles), Course 6 (Finance and Investments), and APC in addition to the preliminary exams.

In 2005, the SOA introduced the VEE as the additional topics covered by actuarial education in addition to exams. The 3 VEE subjects were: applied statistical methods, corporate finance, and economics. The introduction of VEE also decreased the scope of preliminary exams. As a part of the education pathways reform, the SOA temporarily admitted candidates to associateship if they completed 2 courses from Course 5, 6, 7, 8, and Professional Development Requirement (PD). Note that Course 7 (Applied Actuarial Modeling), Course 8 (Advanced Specialized Actuarial Practice), and PD were part of the fellowship requirement.

In 2007, the Fundamentals of Actuarial Practice (FAP) were introduced to cover real-world topics such as insurance and professionalism with readings, case studies, and projects. The FAP modules superseded the former Course 5 (Application of Basic Actuarial Principles) and Course 7 (Applied Modeling). The FAP, which contained eight modules and two assessments, became the only option to attain associateship effective January 2007.

In 2018, the VEE subjects were amended to accounting and finance, economics, and mathematical statistics as part of preliminary exams reform.

In 2023, more e-learning modules were added to the education requirement as a part of educational pathway redesign, including the Pre-Actuarial Foundations (PAF), Actuarial Science Foundations (ASF), and Advanced Topics in Predictive Analytics (ATPA). The FAP has been reduced to five modules and one final assessment.

=== Fellowship exams and components ===
Upper-level exam topics for the FSA designation include plan design, risk classification, enterprise risk management, ratemaking, and valuation. Three fellowship exams are taken in one of six specialization tracks chosen by the candidate: Corporate Finance &amp; Enterprise Risk Management (CFE), Quantitative Finance &amp; Investments (QFI), Individual Life Insurance &amp; Annuities (ILA), Retirement Benefits (RB), Group &amp; Health Insurance (GH), or General Insurance (GI). The SOA updated the Fellowship tracks in 2018 and 2023. The SOA also plans to significantly change the structure of the FSA tracks in fall 2025.

In addition to the exams, candidates also need to complete three e-learning modules, the Decision Making and Communication (DMAC) module, and the virtual or in-person Fellowship Admissions Course (FAC).

<text>Philip Kenyon Chapman (5 March 1935 – 5 April 2021) was the first Australian-born American astronaut, serving for about five years in NASA Astronaut Group 6 (1967).

==Education==
Born in Melbourne, Australia, Chapman&#x27;s family moved to Sydney while he was a child. After attending the Fort Street Opportunity School (which Douglas Mawson also attended), Chapman attended Parramatta High School. He went on to earn a B.S. in physics and mathematics from the University of Sydney, in 1956. He then attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States, earning a M.S. in aeronautics and astronautics in 1964 and a Sc.D. in instrumentation in 1967. His doctoral thesis advisors included Nobel Laureates Steven Weinberg and Rainer Weiss.

==Work==
Chapman served with the Royal Australian Air Force Reserve from 1953 to 1955. He learned to fly (in a Tiger Moth) during Australian National Service.

From 1956 to 1957, he worked for Philips Electronics Industries Proprietary Limited in Sydney, Australia. He then spent 15 months at Mawson Station, Antarctica with the Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions (ANARE), for the International Geophysical Year (IGY), 1958, as an auroral/radio physicist. The work required that he spend most of the winter at a remote, 2-man base, near the world&#x27;s largest Emperor penguin rookery, near Taylor Glacier. Chapman explored the local area, being the first human to climb Chapman Ridge which he and his team members called Mount Rumdoodle.

From 1960 to 1961, he was an electro-optics staff engineer in flight simulators for Canadian Aviation Electronics Limited in Dorval, Quebec. His next assignment was as a staff physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he worked in electro-optics, inertial systems at the Experimental Astronomy Lab, under the direction of Charles Stark &quot;Doc&quot; Draper, and gravitational theory with Rainer Weiss until the summer of 1967.

After gaining U.S. citizenship, Chapman was selected as a scientist-astronaut by NASA in August 1967. He trained as an astronaut, including jet pilot training with the USAF and the US Navy Underwater School, and served as the Apollo 14 Mission Scientist.

Chapman resigned from the program near the close of the Apollo Program in July 1972, largely because he strongly disagreed with the decision to build the Space Shuttle. Publicly, he said, &quot;It appears that we have to make a choice between losing our competency as pilots or losing our competency as scientists.&quot;

After spending the next five years working on laser propulsion at Avco Everett Research Laboratory as the special assistant to Arthur Kantrowitz, he moved to Arthur D. Little to work with Peter Glaser, the inventor of the solar power satellite (SPS). Chapman was actively involved in the NASA/DOE SPS Concept Development and Evaluation Program (CDEP) in the late 1970s and early 1980s and has since continued to make contributions to the literature on power from space.

In the mid-1980s, Chapman shifted his focus to commercial space—building private companies that develop products and services for space-based, as well as Earth-oriented businesses. He served as president of the L5 Society (now the National Space Society) during the successful campaign to stop the US Senate from ratifying the Moon Treaty, which would have excluded any commercial activity on the Moon.

Chapman was a member of the Citizens&#x27; Advisory Council on National Space Policy, which has advised several US Presidents on space-related issues. In particular, a position paper by the council was instrumental in convincing Ronald Reagan that it was technically feasible to intercept ballistic missiles in flight. Opponents thought the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) was a fantasy, dubbing it &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

In 1989, Chapman led a privately funded scientific expedition by sea from Cape Town, South Africa to Enderby Land, Antarctica, to gather information about mineral resources before the Madrid Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty made prospecting illegal on the continent.

From 1989–1994, Chapman was the president of Echo Canyon Software in Boston which produced the first visual programming environment for Windows, before Microsoft introduced Visual Basic.

In 1998, Chapman was Chief Scientist of Rotary Rocket of San Mateo, California. Rotary Rocket built and flew atmospheric tests of the Roton, a novel crewed, re-usable space launch vehicle.

In 2004, Chapman presented two papers at the 55th International Astronautical Congress (Vancouver CANADA). The first, &quot;Luces in the Sky with Diamonds,&quot; presented a design for a gossamer, iso-inertial SPS using thin films of artificial diamond in thermionic conversion devices. The second paper, &quot;Power from Space and the Hydrogen Economy,&quot; discussed the implications of the recent discovery of vast deposits of methane hydrates under Arctic permafrost and on continental shelves, which may be sufficient to meet &quot;all&quot; world energy needs for many thousands of years. See the web address below for full text of this paper.

Chapman was Chief Scientist of Transformational Space Corporation, &quot;t/Space&quot; of Reston, VA. Under a $6 million contract from NASA, t/Space developed a plan and re-usable vehicle to support the International Space Station (ISS) for after the shuttle&#x27;s retirement in 2011. The Roton is a crewed spacecraft that is owned and operated by private enterprise. NASA has now adopted commercial support as its baseline plan for the ISS.

In 2009, Chapman formed the Solar High Study Group, &quot;a team of senior managers and technologists with directly relevant experience who believe that space-based solar power can solve the problem of bringing clean, affordable energy to people anywhere on Earth or in space.&quot; In July 2010, Chapman presented slides to the US Air Force on the topic of Tactical and Strategic Implications of Space-Based Solar Power (SBSP). Main conclusions include the US is able to deploy SBSP within 7 years with technologies now at Technology Readiness Level 6+ and that a study of national security implications of SBSP is urgently needed. Information from this event will contribute to a USAF policy paper on its energy strategy.

==Views on global warming==
On 23 April 2008, Chapman authored an op-ed in The Australian newspaper, noting a new ice age will eventually occur, that based on current low solar activity it might even be imminent, and &quot;It is time to put aside the global warming dogma, at least to begin contingency planning about what to do if we are moving into another little ice age, similar to the one that lasted from 1100 to 1850.&quot; A response by IPCC affiliated meteorologist David Karoly was published a few days later.

Chapman wrote a blog that included 17 entries categorized as Global Warming. Those entries presented much data and commentary to support his point of view.

==Biography==
Chapman&#x27;s career is chronicled in the book &quot;NASA&#x27;s Scientist-Astronauts&quot; by David Shayler and Colin Burgess, the book Shattered Dreams, and in many articles and books.

Chapman&#x27;s NASA years are also described in &quot;Australia&#x27;s Astronauts: Three Men and a Spaceflight Dream&quot;, 1999, by Colin Burgess.

Chapman died on 5 April 2021, at the age of 86. On January 8, 2024, a sample of Chapman&#x27;s cremated remains was launched aboard the maiden flight of ULA&#x27;s Vulcan Centaur. The payload included the lunar lander Peregrine with the ashes of Arthur C. Clarke to be deposited on the Moon. The third stage payload, Celestis&#x27; Enterprise, include the ashes of Philip K. Chapman and the DNA of 4 US presidents, including those of US President John F. Kennedy who launched NASA&#x27;s Apollo Program. On board were also remains of several members of the original cast of the TV program, Star Trek. The Enterprise will complete a 2.5 year mission to stabilize in a helio-centric orbit between the Earth and Venus and will remain there until the end of the Sun. When it has stabilized in its helio-centric orbit, the vehicle will be renamed Enterprise Station to signify its contents of the first ever human remains in deep space.

<doc id="337201" wikidata="Q14683220" url="?curid=337201" title="Lynbrook High School">
<text>Lynbrook High School (also referred to as Lynbrook or LHS) is a co-educational, public, four-year high school located in the West San Jose neighborhood of San Jose, California. It was founded in 1965 and graduated its first class in 1968.

Lynbrook is in the Fremont Union High School District along with Monta Vista High School, Cupertino High School, Fremont High School, and Homestead High School. It is fairly close to Miller Middle School. It is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges.

Several measures rank Lynbrook as one of the best high schools in the San Francisco Bay Area, California and the nation. In 2016, &quot;Newsweek&quot; ranked Lynbrook as the 29th best high school in the United States. Another report of public and private high schools by &quot;Business Insider&quot; and &quot;Niche&quot; ranked the students&#x27; average SAT/ACT scores as 7th nationwide. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; ranked Lynbrook first among all public high schools in California using a similar metric. Separately, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked the school as the 17th best in the nation for Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM). A larger percentage of its graduates are accepted into the University of California (UC) system than at any other school in the Fremont Union High School District.

==History==

Lynbrook High School opened on September 13, 1965, with an enrollment of 1,026 freshmen and sophomores. Because Cupertino High School had grown very large by that time, a new school in the West San Jose area was constructed. The District Board nominated Kendall Stanger as the first principal of the school. The school was technologically advanced around the time it was built and had closed-circuit television and air conditioning. During the first year, there was no gymnasium, locker room, or swimming pool. By the second school year, the gymnasium, locker room, and an Olympic-size swimming pool had been built.

==Campus==
Many of Lynbrook&#x27;s buildings and facilities are in their original state and have not been significantly renovated until 2019, when the quad and cafeteria was under construction for a year and finished renovations 2019. Construction for the gym and main student parking lot have been completed. However, the bleachers in the main gym were replaced between 2003 and 2006. Most of Lynbrook&#x27;s buildings are constructed of old red brick exteriors. New structures and facilities built since 1990 include the library, swimming pool, field house, and special education buildings. During the summer in 2009, the parking lot was renovated and solar panels were added. In the fall of 2012, the football field and track was renovated, including new lights. The library has also been redesigned.

Lynbrook has a football field with a synthetic track around it, a baseball field, and a field hockey/soccer field, also known as Stober field. Lynbrook&#x27;s Olympic-sized swimming pool is in excellent condition. During water polo season, Lynbrook&#x27;s nine-lane swimming pool devotes about half of its area to non-lane-divided deep-water areas. The deep-water area is used mainly for water polo competitions. The pool was renovated in the summer of 2009, and no longer has diving boards. The softball and field hockey areas were renovated in 2006-2007. In 2024, the Rocklin Science Center was constructed.

A new building that houses the new weight room and dance studio was added west of the Field House during the 2017-2018 school year and opened for use in May 2018. This construction is the first of three stages of campus renovation. Stage two began in the summer of 2018 with the demolition of the quad, cafeteria, and old dance studio building. The new quad and cafeteria have since opened and when they have completed stage 3 of the renovation will begin with an added gym lobby, new main office, and a widespread re-arranging of building usage.

The classroom wings are on the back (east) side of the school and are numbered from 101-615. The 100 and 200 wings are on the north side, and the 500 and 600 wings are on the south side. The gymnasium, swimming pool, and tennis and basketball courts are situated on the southwest side of Lynbrook&#x27;s campus. The western third of the campus consists of the Stober field (a large green lawn used primarily for field hockey practice and student events) and a football field. The visual and performing arts center is the school&#x27;s easternmost building. The school&#x27;s mural of the Viking, which faces the main parking lot, is painted on the building that houses the girls&#x27; locker rooms and the weight training room.

The quad is the hub of student life at Lynbrook and is surrounded by the cafeteria, classroom wings, auditorium, and the gym. School-wide homecoming skits were performed in the quad until it was demolished, during construction they take place on the blacktop near the tennis courts. Other student activities that took place in the old quad, including &quot;Club Food Day&quot; and homecoming skits, are also now held near the tennis courts. On Club Food Day, participating clubs set up tables and fundraise by selling food and drinks. Spirit Weeks, week-long events put on by the Associated Student Body (ASB), were also held in the quad. Spirit weeks culminate in a school-wide rally at the end of the week, located in the main gym. While the bleachers in the main gym were being replaced, rallies were held outdoors in the quad.

==Academics==
Lynbrook has widely been known for consistently being one of the top 20 academic high schools in California for several years. Lynbrook&#x27;s academic reputation has also influenced the real estate market in the surrounding neighborhood, causing home prices to rise higher than other neighborhoods in the San Jose area.

As of 2011, Lynbrook High School&#x27;s base Academic Performance Index (API) is 943, which is 201 points higher than the state average for high schools, and is similar to those of Saratoga, Mission San Jose, and Monta Vista. The API ranking for Lynbrook High School is 19 out of 19, which is the best rating possible for any school, and its similar-schools API ranking is 9 out of 10. In 2008, Lynbrook was ranked 6th out of all public schools in the state of California, excluding magnet schools, based on API scores.

In 2007, the school scored a 10 out of 10 in both API Statewide and Similar School ranking.

Lynbrook students consistently receive high marks on standardized exams, including the SAT and Advanced Placement Exams. A report of public and private high schools by &quot;Business Insider&quot; and &quot;Niche&quot; ranked the students&#x27; average SAT/ACT scores as 7th nationwide. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; ranked Lynbrook first among all public high schools in California using a similar metric. On the SAT Reasoning Test, the mean critical reading score for the class of 2012 was 636/800, the mean writing score was 668/800, and the mean mathematics score was 696/800. The mean composite score on the SAT was a 2000/2400. Out of 1585 tests taken by 672 students who took Advanced Placement Exams in May 2012, 57% scored a 5, the highest score possible, and 94% of the people passed by scoring a 3 or higher.

Lynbrook produced 62 National Merit semifinalists, and 93 commended students from the class of 2013, which is the highest proportion based on the size of the graduating class (431) out of all of the high schools in the Fremont Union High School District.

Lynbrook has a relatively high proportion of high student GPA&#x27;s, and the top 10 percent of students have a GPA from 3.97 to 4.00. More than half of all Lynbrook graduates attend the University of California, making Lynbrook one of the university&#x27;s largest feeders. Not all students attend four-year colleges; about one-fourth attend two-year colleges such as nearby De Anza College before transferring to other institutions.

In 2009–2010, Lynbrook had a total of 6 semifinalists, two finalists, and one 2nd-place student from the Intel Science Talent Search, one of the most prestigious science competitions in America.

Persky was recalled as a judge by Santa Clara County voters in 2018 for his handling of the Turner case (the first judge to be recalled in California since 1932).

The school made the following statement regarding Persky&#x27;s employment:
&quot;Mr. Persky is in his first year as an athletic coach in our District. He applied for the open coaching position over the summer and successfully completed all of the District’s hiring requirements before starting as a coach, including a fingerprint background check.

In addition to celebrating faculty and student accomplishments, this commission runs the Facebook and Instagram page known as Humans of Lynbrook High, featuring interviews from students and staff.

====Social====
Social commissioners are in charge of overseeing, publicizing, and planning events, such as school dances, movie nights, and the InDesign fashion show, for students to get together and socialize.

====Spirit====
Spirit Commissioners play the biggest role in rallies by organizing the themes, games, script, and presentation of sports teams. During the rallies, they may have the center stage as MCs. They also run several other events throughout the year aiming to increase student participation. During other events, they may introduce activities, classes, speakers, etc. They work closely with Tech in video production and will work to promote student involvement in all activities. Examples of this include Homecoming Week as well as Junior/Senior Prom.

====IDC====

Currently, the Residency Verification policy states that all students who are enrolled in Lynbrook High School must be physically residing within the district&#x27;s boundaries. The Residency Verification Anonymous Hotline is one of the district&#x27;s ways of helping to enforce the policy (&quot;see&quot; Fremont Union High School District). However, a small number of students live elsewhere but are allowed enrollment due to lottery enrollment or by exceptions from the district.

<text>Mirabel () is a suburb of Montreal, located on the North Shore in southern Quebec.

Mirabel is also the name of a territory equivalent to a regional county municipality (TE) and census division (CD) of Quebec, coextensive with the city of Mirabel. Its geographical code is 74. Prior to 2002, Mirabel was not only a city but also comprised the Mirabel Regional County Municipality.

The city is home to Montréal–Mirabel International Airport.

==History==

Mirabel was formed through the expropriation of private lands and the merger of 8 municipalities in 1971. The former municipalities were (with their individual founding dates in brackets): Saint-Augustin (1855); Saint-Benoît (1855); Saint-Hermas (1855); Saint-Janvier-de-Blainville (1855); Sainte-Scholastique (1855); Saint-Canut (1857); Sainte-Monique (1872), and Saint-Janvier-de-la-Croix (1959). Initially called Ville de Sainte-Scholastique but renamed Mirabel in 1973, the city was planned to become a vast transportation and industrial hub for Eastern Canada, with Montréal–Mirabel International Airport at its centre.

Montréal–Mirabel International Airport, which opened in 1975, never became a major aviation hub and the industrial parks never materialized, and in 2004, the airport closed to all scheduled commercial passenger traffic. It continues to operate as a cargo airport and handles a few charter passenger flights.

In 2000, about of Mirabel&#x27;s territory was annexed by Lachute.

<text>A personal identification number (PIN; sometimes redundantly a PIN code or PIN number) is a numeric (sometimes alpha-numeric) passcode used in the process of authenticating a user accessing a system.

The PIN has been the key to facilitating the private data exchange between different data-processing centers in computer networks for financial institutions, governments, and enterprises. PINs may be used to authenticate banking systems with cardholders, governments with citizens, enterprises with employees, and computers with users, among other uses.

In common usage, PINs are used in ATM or POS transactions, secure access control (e.g. computer access, door access, car access), internet transactions, or to log into a restricted website.

==History==
The PIN originated with the introduction of the automated teller machine (ATM) in 1967, as an efficient way for banks to dispense cash to their customers. The first ATM system was that of Barclays in London, in 1967; it accepted cheques with machine-readable encoding, rather than cards, and matched the PIN to the cheque. 1972, Lloyds Bank issued the first bank card to feature an information-encoding magnetic strip, using a PIN for security. James Goodfellow, the inventor who patented the first personal identification number, was awarded an OBE in the 2006 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours.

Mohamed M. Atalla invented the first PIN-based hardware security module (HSM), dubbed the &quot;Atalla Box,&quot; a security system that encrypted PIN and ATM messages and protected offline devices with an un-guessable PIN-generating key. In 1972, Atalla filed for his PIN verification system, which included an encoded card reader and described a system that utilized encryption techniques to assure telephone link security while entering personal ID information that was transmitted to a remote location for verification.

He founded Atalla Corporation (now Utimaco Atalla) in 1972, and commercially launched the &quot;Atalla Box&quot; in 1973. The product was released as the Identikey. It was a card reader and customer identification system, providing a terminal with plastic card and PIN capabilities. The system was designed to let banks and thrift institutions switch to a plastic card environment from a passbook program. The Identikey system consisted of a card reader console, two customer PIN pads, intelligent controller and built-in electronic interface package. The device consisted of two keypads, one for the customer and one for the teller. It allowed the customer to type in a secret code, which is transformed by the device, using a microprocessor, into another code for the teller. During a transaction, the customer&#x27;s account number was read by the card reader. This process replaced manual entry and avoided possible key stroke errors. It allowed users to replace traditional customer verification methods such as signature verification and test questions with a secure PIN system. In recognition of his work on the PIN system of information security management, Atalla has been referred to as the &quot;Father of the PIN&quot;.

The success of the &quot;Atalla Box&quot; led to the wide adoption of PIN-based hardware security modules. Its PIN verification process was similar to the later IBM 3624. By 1998 an estimated 70% of all ATM transactions in the United States were routed through specialized Atalla hardware modules, and by 2003 the Atalla Box secured 80% of all ATM machines in the world, increasing to 85% as of 2006. Atalla&#x27;s HSM products protect 250million card transactions every day as of 2013, and still secure the majority of the world&#x27;s ATM transactions as of 2014.

==Financial services==
=== PIN usage===
In the context of a financial transaction, usually both a private &quot;PIN code&quot; and public user identifier are required to authenticate a user to the system. In these situations, typically the user is required to provide a non-confidential user identifier or token (the &quot;user ID&quot;) and a confidential PIN to gain access to the system. Upon receiving the user ID and PIN, the system looks up the PIN based upon the user ID and compares the looked-up PIN with the received PIN. The user is granted access only when the number entered matches the number stored in the system. Hence, despite the name, a PIN does not &quot;personally&quot; identify the user. The PIN is not printed or embedded on the card but is manually entered by the cardholder during automated teller machine (ATM) and point of sale (POS) transactions (such as those that comply with EMV), and in card not present transactions, such as over the Internet or for phone banking.

=== PIN length===
The international standard for financial services PIN management, ISO 9564-1, allows for PINs from four up to twelve digits, but recommends that for usability reasons the card issuer not assign a PIN longer than six digits. The inventor of the ATM, John Shepherd-Barron, had at first envisioned a six-digit numeric code, but his wife could only remember four digits, and that has become the most commonly used length in many places, although banks in Switzerland and many other countries require a six-digit PIN.

=== PIN validation ===
There are several main methods of validating PINs. The operations discussed below are usually performed within a hardware security module (HSM).

==== IBM 3624 method====
One of the earliest ATM models was the IBM 3624, which used the IBM method to generate what is termed a &quot;natural PIN&quot;. The natural PIN is generated by encrypting the primary account number (PAN), using an encryption key generated specifically for the purpose. This key is sometimes referred to as the PIN generation key (PGK). This PIN is directly related to the primary account number. To validate the PIN, the issuing bank regenerates the PIN using the above method, and compares this with the entered PIN.

Natural PINs cannot be user selectable because they are derived from the PAN. If the card is reissued with a new PAN, a new PIN must be generated.

Natural PINs allow banks to issue PIN reminder letters as the PIN can be generated.

==== IBM 3624 + offset method====
To allow user-selectable PINs it is possible to store a PIN offset value. The offset is found by subtracting the natural PIN from the customer selected PIN using modulo 10. For example, if the natural PIN is 1234, and the user wishes to have a PIN of 2345, the offset is 1111.

The offset can be stored either on the card track data, or in a database at the card issuer.

To validate the PIN, the issuing bank calculates the natural PIN as in the above method, then adds the offset and compares this value to the entered PIN.

==== VISA method ====
The VISA method is used by many card schemes and is not VISA-specific. The VISA method generates a PIN verification value (PVV). Similar to the offset value, it can be stored on the card&#x27;s track data, or in a database at the card issuer. This is called the reference PVV.

The VISA method takes the rightmost eleven digits of the PAN excluding the checksum value, a PIN validation key index (PVKI, chosen from one to six, a PVKI of 0 indicates that the PIN cannot be verified through PVS) and the required PIN value to make a 64-bit number, the PVKI selects a validation key (PVK, of 128 bits) to encrypt this number. From this encrypted value, the PVV is found.

To validate the PIN, the issuing bank calculates a PVV value from the entered PIN and PAN and compares this value to the reference PVV. If the reference PVV and the calculated PVV match, the correct PIN was entered.

Unlike the IBM method, the VISA method does not derive a PIN. The PVV value is used to confirm the PIN entered at the terminal, was also used to generate the reference PVV. The PIN used to generate a PVV can be randomly generated, user-selected or even derived using the IBM method.

==PIN security==
Financial PINs are often four-digit numbers in the range 0000–9999, resulting in 10,000 possible combinations. Switzerland issues six-digit PINs by default.

Some systems set up default PINs and most allow the customer to set up a PIN or to change the default one, and on some a change of PIN on first access is mandatory. Customers are usually advised not to set up a PIN-based on their or their spouse&#x27;s birthdays, on driver license numbers, consecutive or repetitive numbers, or some other schemes. Some financial institutions do not give out or permit PINs where all digits are identical (such as 1111, 2222, ...), consecutive (1234, 2345, ...), numbers that start with one or more zeroes, or the last four digits of the cardholder&#x27;s social security number or birth date.

Many PIN verification systems allow three attempts, thereby giving a card thief a putative 0.03% probability of guessing the correct PIN before the card is blocked. This holds only if all PINs are equally likely and the attacker has no further information available, which has not been the case with some of the many PIN generation and verification algorithms that financial institutions and ATM manufacturers have used in the past.

Research has been done on commonly used PINs. The result is that without forethought, a sizable portion of users may find their PIN vulnerable. &quot;Armed with only four possibilities, hackers can crack 20% of all PINs. Allow them no more than fifteen numbers, and they can tap the accounts of more than a quarter of card-holders.&quot;

Breakable PINs can worsen with length, to wit:
===Implementation flaws===
In 2002, two PhD students at Cambridge University, Piotr Zieliński and Mike Bond, discovered a security flaw in the PIN generation system of the IBM 3624, which was duplicated in most later hardware. Known as the decimalization table attack, the flaw would allow someone who has access to a bank&#x27;s computer system to determine the PIN for an ATM card in an average of 15 guesses.

==Reverse PIN hoax==
Rumours have been in e-mail and Internet circulation claiming that in the event of entering a PIN into an ATM backwards, law enforcement will be instantly alerted as well as money being ordinarily issued as if the PIN had been entered correctly. The intention of this scheme would be to protect victims of muggings; however, despite the system being proposed for use in some US states, there are no ATMs currently in existence that employ this software.

==Mobile phone passcodes==
A mobile phone may be PIN protected. If enabled, the PIN (also called a passcode) for GSM mobile phones can be between four and eight digits and is recorded in the SIM card. If such a PIN is entered incorrectly three times, the SIM card is blocked until a personal unblocking code (PUC or PUK), provided by the service operator, is entered. If the PUC is entered incorrectly ten times, the SIM card is permanently blocked, requiring a new SIM card from the mobile carrier service.

The series, produced by Toei Animation, Asatsu and Asahi Broadcasting Corporation, consists of 52 half-hour episodes, which aired on ABC, TV Asahi and other ANN stations in Japan from January 19, 1986, to January 11, 1987.

The show focuses on the adventures of Patty Rabbit, Bobby Bear and their families, in a small city inhabited by anthropomorphic animals named Maple Town. The series was followed by a 50-episode sequel, &quot;New Maple Town Stories: Palm Town Chapter&quot;, which retained only Patty Rabbit (and her voice actor, Maya Okamoto) from both series, although Maple Town&#x27;s citizens made cameos from time to time. To date, this has not had an official English release.

The show was dubbed into English and syndicated in the United States in 1987. The program spawned collectable figurines with changeable clothing, as well as houses, furniture and vehicles. Tonka was the US licensee and manufacturer.

VHS compilations of &quot;Maple Town&quot; appeared in North America, Europe and Japan during the late 1980s and early 1990s. As of 2013, official DVDs of the show had surfaced in Japan, Spain and Hungary, with no release plans announced for other territories.

==Plot summary==
Patty Hoperabbit, along with her family, arrives in Maple Town, a small town inhabited by friendly animals, but in a train heist by the sly – if usually &quot;endearingly unsuccessful&quot; – thief, Wilde Wolf stole the mailbag from her father and escaped into the forest. Soon she followed after him to retrieve the mailbag. In the midst of getting the bag back from the thief, she befriends a boy of her age named Bobby Kumanoff who has the bag. After they escape from Wilde Wolf and outwit him, they deliver the mailbag safely to her father. Soon, the Rabbit Family settles in Maple Town as mail carriers and the bitter, yet sweet friendship of Patty and Bobby begins to blossom. At the same time they try to foil Wilde Wolf&#x27;s plans.

The series&#x27; setting is Canada around the 1920s, while the setting of &quot;Palm Town Chapter&quot; is based on the West Coast of the United States around the 1980s.

==Episodes==
==Production==
The series was produced by Toei Animation, Asatsu and Asahi Broadcasting. &quot;Maple Town&quot; was created by Chifude Asakura and directed by Junichi Sato. It served as one of the first projects for Kunihiko Ikuhara, who later joined the crew of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; and &quot;Revolutionary Girl Utena&quot;. Ikuhara served as an assistant director and production manager for some of the show&#x27;s later episodes.

===United States===
In October 1986, toy manufacturer Tonka acquired the rights for US$2.5–3 million and became its US licensee, launching a toy line and ad campaign early the following year. Tonka invested US$7 million on television ads for the toy line. An English-dubbed version, airing in tandem with the toy promotion, starred actress Karen Hartman (credited as Janice Adams), known previously for her other children&#x27;s TV role as Talkatoo Cockatoo on &quot;Zoobilee Zoo&quot;, as Mrs. Maple in its book-ending live-action segments. Mrs. Maple was the only human inhabitant of the title town in this version, and she offered each episode&#x27;s moral lesson. The voice cast included Reba West as Patty Rabbit and Steve Kramer as Wilde Wolf.

The English version of &quot;Maple Town&quot; was produced by Saban Entertainment and The Maltese Companies, the latter of which also produced &quot;Spiral Zone&quot;, another syndicated series with Tonka, and the 1988 animated feature &quot;Pound Puppies and the Legend of Big Paw&quot;.

==Broadcast history==
The original &quot;Maple Town&quot; series aired on Sunday mornings in Japan on TV Asahi, from January 19, 1986, until January 11, 1987. Following its 52nd episode, its follow-up, , aired in the same time slot.

The first ten episodes of the English dub by Saban Entertainment and The Maltese Companies premiered in barter syndication in 1987 as a trial run on US television, then sixteen more episodes premiered on Nickelodeon, where it aired until September 1, 1989. It then aired on The CBN Family Channel/The Family Channel from September 4, 1989 until September 13, 1990. A 65-episode run was originally announced, but only 39 ever reached US television.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, European stations aired &quot;Maple Town&quot; in their various native languages. In Spain, TVE aired the program under the title &quot;La aldea del arce&quot;, starting in 1987. In France, the series was distributed by IDDH and broadcast from May 3, 1987, on FR3 in the program Amuse 3 under the name &quot;Les Petits Malins&quot;. It also aired on RTL Veronique in the Netherlands (as &quot;Avonturen in Maple Town&quot;); in Finland under the title &quot;Seikkailumetsä&quot;; in Sweden as &quot;Äventyrsskogen&quot;; and on Hungary&#x27;s RTL Klub channel as &quot;Juharfalvi történetek&quot;.

As with Japan, several other countries aired both series of the &quot;Maple Town&quot; franchise. In Italy, Mediaset&#x27;s Italia 1 broadcast both iterations of &quot;Maple Town&quot; during the late 1980s (under the titles &quot;Maple Town: Un nido di simpatia&quot; and &quot;Evviva Palm Town&quot;). The combined series aired as &quot;Les petits malins&quot; on FR3 in France at the time. On Nasza TV&#x27;s showings in Poland, the show was known as &quot;Opowiesci z Klonowego Miasteczka&quot; and &quot;Opowiesci z Palmowego Miasteczka&quot;. In Hong Kong, &quot;Maple Town&quot; aired on the ATV network during 1991. Both shows also aired in Arabic speaking nations with the first series broadcast under أرنوبة ودبدوب (Arnoba Wa Dabdoob, Arnoba and Dabdood) and second airing under مدينة النخيل (Madina Al Nakheel, Palms Town).

==Home video==

During the 1990s, Toei Video released a ten-tape collection of &quot;Maple Town&quot;, each consisting of three episodes in their original airing order. In 2013, TC Entertainment released the original series in DVD box sets as part of Toei&#x27;s &quot;Recollection Anime Library&quot; lineup. The first box set was released on September 27, and the second set on October 30. &quot;Palm Town Chapter&quot; series was also released in the same label on November 27 for the first box set and on December 25 for the second box set.

Select episodes of Saban&#x27;s US dub were released on VHS from late 1987 until 1990 by Family Home Entertainment and Tonka Home Video. Each tape consisted of two stories each, except for the first release, &quot;Welcome to Maple Town&quot;. No less than eight English episodes were distributed in the UK by the now-defunct M.S.D. (Multiple Sound Distributors) label. Multicom Entertainment Group, who owns the US dub (by the way of their acquisition of The Kushner-Locke library in 2013), currently has no plans to release the entire series on home media or onto any streaming service, likely due to them having a hard time licensing the rights to use the cartoons from Toei.

In the Netherlands, CNR Video released a Dutch dub of the first two episodes in 1992. The stories were entitled &quot;De Overval op de Trein&quot; and &quot;Voor het eerst naar de nieuwe school&quot; in the Dutch language.

The entire original series was released on DVD in Spain by Divisa Home Video, in Japan by TC Entertainment, and Hungary&#x27;s Fümoto released some episodes onto that format.

<doc id="337238" wikidata="Q6016411" url="?curid=337238" title="Independent Baptist Fellowship of North America">
<text>The Independent Baptist Fellowship of North America (IBFNA) is a separatist fundamentalist independent Baptist fellowship for pastors and laymembers. Sometimes confused with the Independent Baptist Fellowship International (IBFI), the IBFNA is a northern-oriented fellowship formed by individuals who left the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches (GARBC) due to what they felt was a drift of the association away from their original separatist position. The Fellowship was organized in October 1990 at Oshkosh, Wisconsin. Its constitution was ratified in 1993 at Providence, Rhode Island. It is composed of individuals rather than churches. Individuals must renew their membership annually; churches are recognized as &#x27;supporting churches&#x27; by financially supporting the Fellowship. This body is very local church oriented, and all boards, institutions, and agencies remain in the hands of the churches. Articles of Faith have been adopted, containing statements on the Scriptures, the Triune God, Salvation, Sanctification, the Church, Biblical Separation, Civil Government, Creation, The Fall of Man, the Devil, and End times. &quot;The Review&quot; is a quarterly published by the IBFNA. A Conference is held annually.

In 1994, the individual members of the Fellowship were from 106 different churches, 60 of which were not affiliated with other bodies and 46 were dually aligned with the IBFNA and the GARBC. The greatest strength of this group is in Pennsylvania. A few members are located in Canada. The Independent Baptist Fellowship of North America is a member of the American Council of Christian Churches.

<text>Christ Church Cathedral in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, is the cathedral church of the Anglican Diocese of New Westminster of the Anglican Church of Canada, and the second church to have been the diocese&#x27;s cathedral. A place of worship in Greater Vancouver, the cathedral is located at 690 Burrard Street on the northeast corner of West Georgia Street, directly across from the Fairmont Hotel Vancouver in Downtown Vancouver.

== History ==
Christ Church is a daughter church of St. James&#x27; Anglican Church. The first service was held, without a church building, on December 23, 1888, at 720 Granville Street. On February 14, 1889, a building committee was formed to collect the necessary funds for the erection of the church. It would be located on land bought from the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR); Henry John Cambie, chief engineer of CPR&#x27;s Pacific Division and people&#x27;s warden of the new church, was a key negotiator in acquiring the property.

By October 1889, Christ Church&#x27;s basement was built and on October 6, the opening service was held for 52 parishioners. The joy of a new church was short-lived. By 1891 the CPR objected to the unfinished building that had quickly been nicknamed the root house. It was viewed an &quot;eyesore&quot; and the parishioners feared they would lose their location due to lack of funds to complete the building. The architect
Robert Mackay Fripp submitted a proposal for completion of the church in 1892.

A financing scheme was developed by a parishioner and the cornerstone was finally laid July 28, 1894, and the church dedicated on February 17, 1895. The church was built in the Gothic style with ceiling made of cedar planking and ceiling beams and floor constructed out of old growth Douglas fir. By 1909, the first expansion was done and by 1911, the first organ had already worn out. It used a human blower hired at $5 per month and was replaced by a new organ manufactured by Wurlitzer. 

In 1920, electricity replaced candles for lighting, and in 1930 the lanterns now in the church were installed.

In 1929, the Archbishop of New Westminster constituted Christ Church as the Cathedral Church of the diocese, replacing Holy Trinity Cathedral in the City of New Westminster. 

The church planned to build a bell tower, but in 1943, the city by-laws were changed to restrict church bells. In November 2016, a bell tower was inaugurated. Its four bells are rung daily at 8:00 am and 6:00 pm and before church services.

In 1949, after many building alterations, the Casavant organ was installed. Constructed partially of war surplus parts and remnants of the Wurlitzer, the instrument served well but had a problematic history. 2004 saw the installation of a Kenneth Jones tracker organ in the south gallery of the renovated cathedral. Comprising a three manual console and 2500 pipes, 1700 salvaged from the Casavant, it is the first Christ Church Cathedral organ custom built to speak with optimum effect in the sanctuary.

In 1971, the church membership voted to demolish the building and replace it with a hi-rise tower complex designed by Arthur Erickson. The redevelopment was opposed by the public and in 1976 after much lobbying, the cathedral was named a Class A Heritage building in the municipality of Vancouver and the Province of British Columbia. In 1995, an eleven-year program of restoration and renewal was begun. 

Christ Church Cathedral is the Regimental Church of the Seaforth Highlanders and is in the process of being designated Regimental Church of the BC Regiment, Duke of Connaught&#x27;s Own.

Bishop Michael Ingham authorized a liturgy for the celebration of lesbian and gay covenants in December 2002. Christ Church Cathedral&#x27;s Annual Vestry meeting in February 2003 gave approval for the ministry to be offered as part of the parish&#x27;s pastoral care for the community. On September 25, 2014, the parish submitted &quot;A Statement in Favour of the Solemnization of Same Sex Matrimony in the Anglican Church of Canada&quot; to the Anglican Church of Canada&#x27;s commission on the marriage canon. This statement was submitted by the cathedral&#x27;s clergy, wardens and parish council.

==Worship==

Holy Communion is celebrated using both the Book of Common Prayer and the Book of Alternative Services. Both a simple spoken celebration and a choral or sung Eucharist celebrated with congregational hymns featuring an eclectic mix of Mass settings, psalmody, anthems and instrumental music are practised. Music in worship ranges from plainsong to motets from the baroque and classical periods to contemporary and world music. Cathedral musician Rupert Lang is a prolific and respected composer and many of his sacred pieces debut during this liturgy.

The cathedral clergy share preaching duties at services with guest preachers booked throughout the year. Guest preachers in the recent past have included a former Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie, and the noted environmental scientist David Suzuki. It is also the church at which the royal family worships when in Vancouver.

In May 2014, the cathedral formed St. Brigid&#x27;s, a community rooted in the Emerging Church movement rooted in the Anglican tradition.

==Deans of New Westminster==
Holy Trinity Cathedral in New Westminster formerly housed the Dean of New Westminster, until that seat was moved to Christ Church Cathedral in Vancouver in 1929. The following is a list of deans of New Westminster since 1929: 
* Robert John Renison, 1927–1931, 1st dean (afterwards Bishop of Athabasca, 1931)
* Ramsay Armitage, 1936–1940
* Cecil Beresford Swanson, 1940–1953
* Northcote Richard Burke, 1953–1968
* Thomas Herbert O&#x27;Driscoll, 1968–1982
* James David Cruickshank, 1983–1993 (afterwards Bishop of the Diocese of the Cariboo) 
* Michael Ingham, 1993–1994 (afterwards Anglican Bishop of New Westminster, 1994–2013) 
* Peter Elliott, 1994–2019
* Christopher Pappas, 2020–present
==Heraldry==
The celtic cross, which is found on both the cathedral&#x27;s exterior and interior, represents the roots of the Anglican Communion in the British Isles. The spindle whorl and the three salmon in the style of the Coast Salish Nation, represent the First People of Canada and the original inhabitants of the west coast.

The Greek letters Chi (X) and Rho (P) in the centre are the initials of the words Christus Rex, Christ the King. The motto is &quot;I hold before you an open door&quot; (Revelation 3:8), the title of the first sermon preached in the cathedral by the rector, the Rev. H. B. Hobson, December 23, 1888.

<doc id="337248" wikidata="Q1419018" url="?curid=337248" title="Queen's Park (Toronto)">
<text>Queen&#x27;s Park is an urban park in Downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Opened in 1860 by Edward, Prince of Wales, it was named in honour of Queen Victoria. The park is the site of the Ontario Legislative Building, which houses the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. The phrase &quot;Queen&#x27;s Park&quot; is regularly used as a metonym for the Government of Ontario or the Legislative Assembly of Ontario.

The park is nearly an enclave of the University of Toronto, which occupies most of the surrounding lands. In 1859, the land was leased by the University of Toronto to the City of Toronto government for a 999-year term. In 1880, a &quot;portion of the Queen&#x27;s Park [was] selected [and given to] the Government of Ontario, as a site for the erection of new Legislative and Departmental buildings&quot;. The land that is occupied by the Legislative Assembly of Ontario is owned by the Government of Ontario. The north park is owned by the University of Toronto and leased to the city. Ministry buildings of the Ontario government occupy other properties to the east of the park, in an area between Wellesley Street and Grosvenor Street.

==History==
Shortly after King&#x27;s College (later renamed the University of Toronto) was established in 1827, the institution purchased from two farming estates north of the Town of York (present-day Toronto), including present day Queen&#x27;s Park.

This was part of the from portions of three park lots:

* North Half of Park Lot 11 from Mary Elmsley (John Elmsley&#x27;s estate was sold by his wife Mary Hallowell after his death in 1805)
* North half of Park Lot 12 from William Dummer Powell
* North half of Park Lot 13 from D&#x27;Arcy Boulton

The cornerstone for one of the college&#x27;s earliest buildings was laid at the site on 23 April 1842. The building was built on the present site of the east wing of the Ontario Legislative Building, and was completed in 1843; although it remained vacant until 1845. The building was initially planned to be the southeast wing for a larger building, although these additional wings were never built as a result of budget shortfalls. The building was situated within a landscaped park surrounded by tree-lined avenues, and was accessed through two gates to the north and south. While the university occupied the property it was known as &quot;University Park&quot;.

In 1853, the Parliament of the Province of Canada expropriated the building for its use; with the University of Toronto relocating classes held in that building to the Third Parliament Buildings of Upper Canada. The Parliament of the Province of Canada was based in Toronto from 1849 to 1853 and again from 1856 to 1858; having relocated several times within the Province of Canada during its existence.

Given the park&#x27;s popularity with local residents, the municipal government of Toronto entered negotiations with the university to lease the land for the purposes of creating a public park; with a 999-year lease for of land eventually formalized on 29 August 1858. The terms of the lease also outlined that the government had the right to build a legislative building on the property if they so desired.

On 11 September 1860, the property was officially dedicated as Canada&#x27;s first municipal park by Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII); and was named &quot;Queen&#x27;s Park&quot;, in honour of Queen Victoria. The park was originally planned to be opened the previous Saturday, although heavy rain led the dedication ceremony to be rescheduled to Tuesday. During the ceremony, he also laid a cornerstone for an eventual statue of Queen Victoria at the southern apex of the park. However, financial difficulties and delays would eventually see this spot be occupied by a statue of Sir John A. Macdonald, the first prime minister of Canada. The statue for Victoria would eventually be purchased and placed near the entrance to the legislative building in 1902.

In 1879, the provincial government acted on its option to construct a new legislature on the property and informed the city of its intention to do so. However, construction was delayed by inconclusive design competition, with the design commission finally awarded in 1886 to Richard A. Waite. Ownership of the southern portion of the park was also handed over to the provincial government in 1886. The Ontario Legislative Building was completed in 1892, and hosted its first legislative session on 4 April 1893. After the building&#x27;s completion, Russian cannons originally placed at the southern tip of the park in 1859 were moved to the legislature&#x27;s entrance. The Russian cannons were war prizes captured by British forces during the Crimean War, and gifted to the city of Toronto by Queen Victoria 1859.

Although the new legislative building split the park into two sections, local residents continued to congregate there for concerts, memorial services, military parades, and political gatherings. During the late-19th century, the northern portion of Queen&#x27;s Park also hosted a public speakers&#x27; forum on Sunday. During the First World War, the park was used as a gathering point for soldiers of the Canadian Expeditionary Force.

In 1984, Queen&#x27;s Park hosted two tree planting ceremonies for the eastern white pine, after it was declared the province&#x27;s official tree that year. The first tree planting ceremony took place on 25 May 1984 by Bob Welch, the deputy premier of Ontario in order to commemorate Arbour Day. The second tree planting ceremony also took place that year at the same location, with Queen Elizabeth II and the then-Duke of Edinburgh planting two eastern white pines on 29 September 1984. A plaque marks the spot of the tree plantings, and the trees that grew from it.

In the early 2000s, Canadian poet Dennis Lee and poet advocate Richard Griffin led a campaign to erect a statue of Al Purdy, another Canadian poet, on the grounds of Queen&#x27;s Park. The campaign specifically insisted that the statue should be located at Queen&#x27;s Park, in order to demonstrate the significance of poetry and the arts in Canada&#x27;s cultural life. The statue was eventually built and unveiled in 2008, making it the first statue at Queen&#x27;s Park that commemorates an individual that was not a political figure or monarch.

==Layout==

The shape of Queen&#x27;s Park is similar to an oval, although the southwestern edge of Queens Park &quot;kinks in&quot; somewhat. The &quot;kink&quot; in the southwestern edge formed the former bank of Taddle Creek, a waterway underground. The oval park is bounded by Queen&#x27;s Park Crescent East and West. These form part of a major through route consist of University Avenue (south of College Street), Queen&#x27;s Park Crescent East and West, Queen&#x27;s Park, and Avenue Road (north of Bloor Street).

Queen&#x27;s Park Crescent East and West carry northbound and southbound traffic respectively and are linked to make a complete counterclockwise loop around the park. University Avenue, Queen&#x27;s Park (with no suffix), and Avenue Road have two-way traffic and lie in essentially the same straight line. Wellesley Street bisects Queen&#x27;s Park Crescent slightly north of the loop&#x27;s centre.

The portion of the park north of Wellesley Street is maintained by the Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division and includes a number of benches along paving stones, and picnic tables. The section follows the traditional British design, dominated by large trees that provide extensive cover during summer. The pathways radiate outwards from an equestrian statue of Edward VII, which stands on a large mound at the centre of the northern section. The main north-south path runs between the equestrian statue and the 48th Highlanders of Canada Regimental Memorial at the park&#x27;s northern tip. The north section of Queen&#x27;s Park is the &#x27;saluting station&#x27; for the Province of Ontario. Gun salutes are conducted here to mark special occasions including Victoria Day (fired at 1200 EDT), Canada Day (fired at 1200 EDT), and Remembrance Day (fired at 1102 EST). Other salutes are also conducted here throughout the year as dictated by protocol.

The portion of Queen&#x27;s Park south of Wellesley Street is maintained by the provincial government and includes the Ontario Legislative Building south of Wellesley Street, the parking lot to the south of the building, and the remaining portions of the park. In contrast to the northern portion of the Queen&#x27;s Park, minimal landscaping was done to the southern portion of the park. However, the southern portion of the park includes the majority of the monuments and memorials in the park, and its gardens. 

The first portion of the Queen Elizabeth II rose gardens was dedicated in 1977, to mark the silver jubilee of Elizabeth II. An extension to the garden was added in 2003 to mark the Queen&#x27;s golden jubilee. A platinum jubilee garden featuring tobacco plants from Massey College&#x27;s Chapel Royal was unveiled in 2022 to mark the Queen&#x27;s platinum jubilee. The gardens also feature the first plaque in the park that recognizes the area as Treaty 13 territory. The southern portion of the park also includes the &quot;White Trillium Garden&quot;, a garden that is landscaped with white trilliums, the official floral emblem of the province. There also exists a native species garden, a garden primarily landscaped with vegetation native to the area, including eastern white cedars, hackberries, and some perennial flowers. The southern tip of the park facing University Avenue features the statue of Sir John A. Macdonald, the first prime minister of Canada.

===Geography===

Queen&#x27;s Park is situated on top of sandy sediment, having been deposited there when the area was the floor bed for Glacial Lake Iroquois. Initially, the area was covered with eastern white pine, northern red oak, and white oak trees. However, because a number of non-native trees from Europe were planted around the area during the early 19th century, the park presently holds a large variety of trees from Europe, as well as trees native to Toronto. Attempts have been made to restore the park to resemble how it appeared prior to the introduction of non-native species through the planting of additional trees native to the area.

===Transit access===
Line 1 Yonge-University of the Toronto subway runs below University Avenue, Queen&#x27;s Park (the park, to one side of the legislature), and Queen&#x27;s Park (the street), serving the area via its Queen&#x27;s Park and Museum stations. Other public transit access is provided by the 13 Avenue Road and 94 Wellesley bus routes, and the 506 Carlton streetcar route.

==Memorials and monuments==

Queen&#x27;s Park holds a number of monuments and war memorials to commemorate events and/or individuals. Most of them were erected during the late 19th- to early 20th century, although there are several memorials that were erected in the late-20th and early 21st century. Monuments at the park come in a variety of forms, including a number of full-length statues of persons. Several monuments are also located adjacent to Queen&#x27;s Park.

The park&#x27;s first memorial was the Canadian Volunteer Monument. Unveiled in 1870, it is the second oldest monument in Toronto. Sculpted by Robert Reid, it was dedicated to Toronto residents that fought during the Battle of Ridgeway. A second war memorial was erected in 1895, the Northwest Rebellion Monument. The monument commemorated members of the Canadian Militia and the North-West Mounted Police who fought during the North-West Rebellion. Near the northern apex of Queen&#x27;s Park is the 48th Highlanders of Canada Regimental Memorial, erected in 1923. In 1940, the Mackenzie monument was unveiled, commemorating William Lyon Mackenzie, as well as the establishment of responsible government in the Province of Canada. The monument and bust were sculpted by Walter Seymour Allward. In 1967, the government of Ontario unveiled the Post One Monument, commemorating the Canadian Centennial.

The Ontario Veterans&#x27; Memorial was unveiled on 17 September 2006 and commemorates Ontarians who participated in a military campaign with the Canadian military from Canadian Confederation to the present. The monument is tall on both ends, although it slopes into a central gathering area. The monument is a granite wall with 44 images depicting Canada&#x27;s military history etched into the 24 grey granite panels. Conflicts depicted in these images includes the Fenian raids, North-West Rebellion, Second Boer War, First World War, Second World War, Korean War, and various peacekeeping and support operations during the Cold War, and war in Afghanistan. The monument is topped-off by a black granite. A plaque situated next to the seating area provides a brief recount of Ontario&#x27;s military history, from the War of 1812 to the war in Afghanistan. The memorial was designed by Allan Harding Mackay and landscaping firm Phillips Farevaag Smallenberg; Ontarian-born historian Jack Granatstein wrote the historical text and choose the images, while Ontarian-born poet Jane Urquhart wrote the monumental inscription.

Near the southern tip of the park on the pathway towards the legislative building, there also exist two plaques affixed to boulders. The first boulder was installed in 1935, commemorating the silver jubilee of King George V; whereas the second boulder serves as a memorial for the victims of the Air India Flight 182 bombing in 1985. Another large boulder with a plaque affixed to it is situated northeast of the Mackenzie monument, and commemorates Canadian volunteers of the Mackenzie–Papineau Battalion. The battalion, which partly owes its namesake to William Lyon Mackenzie, fought during the Spanish Civil War as a part of the XV International Brigade.

===Statues of individuals===
In addition to memorials, a number of full-body statues that commemorate individuals are also situated at Queen&#x27;s Park. The majority of the statues are mounted on plinths. Most of the statues situated in the southern portion of the park face away from the legislative building, towards the south.

===Memorials adjacent to the park===
Several monuments are built adjacent to Queen&#x27;s Park, separated by roadways that surround the oval-shaped park. The Canadian Volunteer Monument is located west of Queen&#x27;s Park Crescent West. Three monuments have been commissioned by the government of Ontario and have been installed in locations adjacent to the southern portion of Queen&#x27;s Park. In 2000, the Siggy Puchta-designed Ontario Police Memorial was dedicated to police officers who lost their lives while serving the community. A similar memorial known as the Ontario Firefighters Memorial was also designed by Puchta and unveiled in 2005, honouring firefighters who died while serving the public. The Notre Place Monument commemorates the Franco-Ontarian community as well as the contributions the francophone community made to Ontario.

In addition to these monuments, a statue of Robert Raikes and Norman Bethune are also situated southwest of the park. The statue of Bethune was commissioned by the University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine and was unveiled in 2014.

<text>A Dutch oven, Dutch pot (US English), or casserole dish (international) is a thick-walled cooking pot with a tight-fitting lid. Dutch ovens are usually made of seasoned cast iron; however, some Dutch ovens are instead made of cast aluminium, or ceramic. Some metal varieties are enameled rather than being seasoned, and these are sometimes called French ovens. The international name casserole dish is from the French which means &quot;cooking pot&quot;. They are similar to both the Japanese and the , a traditional Balkan cast-iron oven, and are related to the South African , the Australian Bedourie oven and Spanish .

==History==
===Early European history===
During the 17th century, brass was the preferred metal for English cookware and domestic utensils, and the Dutch produced it at the lowest cost, which, however, was still expensive. In 1702, Abraham Darby was a partner in the Brass Works Company of Bristol, which made malt mills for breweries. Apparently in 1704, Darby visited the Netherlands, where he studied the Dutch methods of working brass, including the casting of brass pots. Darby learned that when making castings, the Dutch used molds made of sand, rather than the traditional loam and clay, and this innovation produced a finer finish on their brassware. In 1706 he started a new brass mill in the Baptist Mills section of Bristol. There, Darby realized that he could sell more kitchen wares if he could replace brass with a cheaper metal, namely, cast iron. Initial experiments to cast iron in sand molds were unsuccessful, but with the aid of one of his workers, James Thomas, a Welshman, he succeeded in casting iron cookware. In 1707 he obtained a patent for the process of casting iron in sand, which derived from the Dutch process. Thus, the term &quot;Dutch oven&quot; has endured for over 300 years, since at least 1710. The &quot;Merriam-Webster Dictionary&quot; and Researching Food History agree that several very different cooking devices were called &quot;Dutch ovens&quot; — a cast-iron pan with legs and a lid; a roughly rectangular box that was open on one side and that was used to roast meats, and a compartment in a brick hearth that was used for baking.

===American history===
American Dutch ovens changed over time during the colonial era. These changes included a shallower pot, legs to hold the oven above the coals, and a lid flange to keep the coals on the lid and out of the food. Paul Revere is credited with the design of the flat lid with a ridge for holding coals as well as the addition of legs to the pots.

Colonists and settlers valued cast-iron cookware because of its versatility and durability. Cooks used them to boil, bake, stew, fry, and roast. The ovens were so valuable that wills in the 18th and 19th centuries frequently spelled out the desired inheritor. For example, Mary Ball Washington (mother of President George Washington) specified in her will, dated 20 May 1788, that one-half of her &quot;iron kitchen furniture&quot; should go to her son-in-law, Fielding Lewis, and the other half to Betty Carter, a granddaughter. This bequest included several Dutch ovens.

Westward-bound settlers took Dutch ovens with them. A Dutch oven was among the gear Lewis and Clark carried when they explored the great American Northwest between 1804 and 1806. Mormon pioneers who settled the American West also took along their Dutch ovens. In fact, a statue raised to honor the Mormon handcart companies who entered Utah&#x27;s Salt Lake Valley in the 1850s proudly displays a Dutch oven hanging from the front of the handcart. The Dutch oven is also the official state cooking pot of Texas, Utah, and Arkansas.

Mountain men exploring the American frontier used Dutch ovens into the late 19th century. Chuckwagons accompanying western cattle drives also carried Dutch ovens from the mid-19th century into the early 20th century.

===Dutch history===

In the Netherlands, a Dutch oven is called a &quot;braadpan&quot;, which literally translates to roasting pan. Another name for it is &quot;sudderpan&quot;, which literally translates to &quot;simmerpan&quot; or &quot;simmering pot&quot;. The design most used today is a black enameled steel pan that is suitable for gas and induction heating. The model was introduced in 1891 by BK, a well-known Dutch manufacturer of cookware. Cheaper and lighter in weight than cast iron, it proved to be a revolution in the kitchen. A braadpan is mainly used for frying meat only, but it can also be used for making traditional stews, such as hachée. Cast-iron models exist, but are used less frequently.

==Types==
===Camping===
A camping, cowboy, or chuckwagon Dutch oven usually has three integral legs, a wire bail handle, and a slightly concave, rimmed lid so that coals from the cooking fire can be placed on top as well as below. This provides more uniform internal heat and lets the inside act as an oven. A Dutch oven without integral legs can be used as a conventional pot on a stove, or may be set on a separate welded steel or cast iron tripod stand or on small stones when cooking on hot coals. These ovens are typically made of bare cast iron, although some are aluminium. The bail handle facilitates lifting the Dutch oven onto and off the coals, using a metal hook. Dutch ovens are often used in Scouting outdoor activities.

===Bedourie oven===

In Australia, a bedourie camp oven is a steel cookpot, shaped and used like a Dutch oven. Named after Bedourie, Queensland, the Bedourie ovens were developed as a more robust, non-breakable alternative to the cast-iron Dutch ovens.

===Potjie===

In South Africa, a potjie ( ) directly translated &quot;pottle or little pot&quot; from Afrikaans or Dutch, is unlike most other Dutch ovens, in that it is round-bottomed. Traditionally it is a single cast, cast-iron pot, reinforced with external double or triple circumscribing ribs, a bail handle for suspending the pot, and three short legs for resting the pot. It is similar in appearance to a cauldron. It has a matching handled lid, which is recessed, and convex to allow for hot coals to rest on top, providing additional heat from above. When the vessel is to be stored long term, care must be taken to avoid rust forming by seasoning. &quot;Potjie&quot; can also refer to the technique of cooking &quot;potjiekos&quot;. Among the recipes that require a potjie, there is one for a type of bread called &quot;potbrood&quot;, which literally means &quot;pot bread&quot;.

Among the South African indigenous peoples, specifically Zulus, these pots also became known as phutu pots, after a popular food prepared in it. The larger pots are normally used for large gatherings, &quot;e.g.&quot;, funerals or weddings, to prepare large quantities of food. Wooden spoons called &quot;kombe&quot; in the Tsonga language are used for mixing and stirring.

This tradition persisted over the years and survives today as a traditional Southern African method of cooking.

===Chugunok===
In Eastern Europe, but mostly in Russia, a chugunok is a cast-iron pot used in a modern oven or in a traditional Russian oven, hearth, or a campfire. A chugunok is used in a variety of cooking methods, including high temperature cooking, low-temperature cooking, thermal cooking, slow cooking, smothering, roasting, baking, braising, and stewing.

The shape of a chugunok is similar to a traditional crock with a narrow top and bottom and wider in the middle. When used inside a traditional oven, a long handled holding tool called is used handle chugunok in the oven. Since a chugunok has no handles, it&#x27;s inconvenient to use a it on a kitchen stove.

==Use in cooking and baking==
Dutch ovens are well suited for long, slow cooking, such as roasts, stews, and casseroles. Virtually any recipe that can be cooked in a conventional oven can be cooked in a Dutch oven.

=== Outdoor Cooking ===
Traditional &quot;camping Dutch ovens,&quot; also known as lipped cast-iron Dutch ovens, are particularly effective as baking ovens over outdoor open fires. Smaller interchangable cooking inserts can be placed inside the oven to cook individual batches or dishes. Additionally, Dutch ovens&#x27; ability to simultaneously provide and retain conductive energy can be leveraged by directly stacking them over the open fire, permitting transfer of heat energy between and among each other.

=== Baking ===
Dutch ovens are known to be particularly useful in the baking of breads best produced at high temperatures and high, consistent humidity. Аs heated steam escapes the dough, the oven&#x27;s heavy lid prevents the vapor from escaping, providing a consistent, somewhat pressurized humid environment inside the oven. This humidity in turn provides essential convection transfer, encouraging a crispy, darker crust which is highly desirable for some breads including sourdoughs, ciabattas, sweet French bread, and the tool&#x27;s name sake, Dutch crunch. 

Dutch ovens also hold significantly more energy density than most cooking tools, such as traditional sauce pans or stock pots. The oven&#x27;s ability to retain energy while providing a consistent conductive transfer to the dough permits a desired carbonization nearly impossible from thinner, less energy dense materials. 

==Seasoning and care==

===Exposed cast iron===
Traditionally Dutch ovens are seasoned like other cast-iron cookware.

A cleaned and oiled Dutch oven should be stored in a clean, dry location with the oven&#x27;s interior open to prevent development of rancid oil. 

As with other cast iron cookware, consistent and appropriate care will eventually produce a shiny, non-stick surface, and may provide many decades of trusted service.

===Enameled ovens===
Enameled ovens provide the convenience of not requiring care needed with exposed cast iron. However, they lose some features such as the ability to tolerate extreme temperatures, especially for extended periods of time.

Enameled ovens are cleaned like other ceramic-lined cookware. Some brands are dishwasher safe, but the oven&#x27;s instructions should be consulted to confirm to prevent potential degradation of the oven&#x27;s ceramic integrity.

<text>Jeffrey Jacob Abrams (born June 27, 1966) is an American filmmaker and composer. He is best known for his works in the genres of action, drama, and science fiction. Abrams wrote and produced films such as &quot;Regarding Henry&quot; (1991), &quot;Forever Young&quot; (1992), &quot;Armageddon&quot; (1998), &quot;Cloverfield&quot; (2008), &quot;Star Trek&quot; (2009), &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; (2015), and &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot; (2019). Abrams&#x27; films have grossed over $4 billion worldwide, making him the tenth-highest-grossing film director of all time.

Abrams has created numerous television series, including &quot;Felicity&quot; (co-creator, 1998–2002), &quot;Alias&quot; (creator, 2001–2006), &quot;Lost&quot; (co-creator, 2004–2010), and &quot;Fringe&quot; (co-creator, 2008–2013). He won two Emmy Awards for &quot;Lost&quot; – Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series and Outstanding Drama Series.

His directorial film work includes &quot;&quot; (2006), &quot;Star Trek&quot; (2009), &quot;Super 8&quot; (2011), and &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot; (2013). He also directed, co-produced, and co-wrote &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;, the seventh episode of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Skywalker Saga and the first film of the sequel trilogy. The film is his highest grossing, the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time not adjusted for inflation, as well as the most expensive film ever made. He returned to &quot;Star Wars&quot; by executive producing &quot;The Last Jedi&quot; (2017), and directing and co-writing &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot; (2019).

Abrams&#x27; frequent collaborators include producer Bryan Burk; producer/directors Damon Lindelof and Tommy Gormley; actors Greg Grunberg, Simon Pegg, Amanda Foreman, and Keri Russell; composer Michael Giacchino; writers Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, cinematographers Daniel Mindel and Larry Fong; and editors Maryann Brandon and Mary Jo Markey.

==Early life==

Jeffrey Jacob Abrams was born on June 27, 1966, in New York City, New York to veteran television producer Gerald W. Abrams (born 1939) of Polish-Jewish descent and Carol Ann Abrams (née Kelvin; 1942–2012), a Peabody Award winning television executive producer as well as author and law academic. His sister is the screenwriter Tracy Rosen. His father worked at CBS in Midtown Manhattan the year prior to Abrams&#x27; birth. By 1971 the family had relocated to Los Angeles. His mother worked as a real estate agent while Abrams and his sister were at school.

Abrams attended Palisades High School and after graduation planned on going to art school rather than a traditional college but eventually enrolled at Sarah Lawrence College, in Bronxville, New York.

==Film career==

===Early career===
Abrams&#x27; first job in the movie business was at age 16 when he wrote the music for Don Dohler&#x27;s 1982 horror movie &quot;Nightbeast&quot;. During his senior year at college, he teamed with Jill Mazursky, the daughter of award-winning writer/director Paul Mazursky, to write a feature film treatment. Purchased by Touchstone Pictures, the treatment was the basis for &quot;Taking Care of Business&quot;, Abrams&#x27; first produced film, which starred Charles Grodin and James Belushi and was directed by Academy Award winner Arthur Hiller. He followed with &quot;Regarding Henry&quot;, starring Harrison Ford, and &quot;Forever Young&quot;, starring Mel Gibson. He also co-wrote with Mazursky the script for the comedy &quot;Gone Fishin&#x27;&quot; starring Joe Pesci and Danny Glover.

In 1994, he was part of the &quot;Propellerheads&quot; with Rob Letterman, Loren Soman, and Andy Waisler, a group of Sarah Lawrence alums experimenting with computer animation technology. They were contracted by Jeffrey Katzenberg to develop animation for the film &quot;Shrek&quot;. Abrams worked on the screenplay for the 1998 film &quot;Armageddon&quot; with producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay. That same year, he made his first foray into television with &quot;Felicity&quot;, which ran for four seasons on The WB Network, serving as the series&#x27; co-creator (with Matt Reeves) and executive producer. He also composed its opening theme music.

===2000s===

Under his production company, Bad Robot, which he founded with Bryan Burk in 2001, Abrams created and executive-produced ABC&#x27;s &quot;Alias&quot; and is co-creator (along with Damon Lindelof and Jeffrey Lieber) and was executive producer of &quot;Lost.&quot; As with &quot;Felicity,&quot; Abrams also composed the opening theme music for &quot;Alias&quot; and &quot;Lost&quot;. Abrams directed and wrote the two-part pilot for &quot;Lost&quot; and remained active producer for the first half of the season. Also in 2001, Abrams co-wrote and produced the horror-thriller &quot;Joy Ride&quot;. In 2006, he served as executive producer of &quot;What About Brian&quot; and &quot;Six Degrees&quot;, also on ABC. He also co-wrote the teleplay for &quot;Lost&quot;″s third-season premiere &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; and the same year, he made his feature directorial debut with &quot;&quot;, starring Tom Cruise. Abrams spoke at the TED conference in 2007.

In 2008, Abrams produced the monster movie &quot;Cloverfield&quot;, which Matt Reeves directed. In 2009, he directed the science fiction film &quot;Star Trek&quot;, which he produced with &quot;Lost&quot; co-creator Damon Lindelof. While it was speculated that they would be writing and producing an adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; series of novels, they publicly stated in November 2009 that they were no longer looking to take on that project. In 2008, Abrams co-created, executive produced, and co-wrote (along with Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman) the FOX science fiction series &quot;Fringe&quot;, for which he also composed the theme music. He was featured in the 2009 MTV Movie Awards 1980s-style digital short &quot;Cool Guys Don&#x27;t Look at Explosions&quot;, with Andy Samberg and Will Ferrell, in which he plays a keyboard solo. NBC picked up Abrams&#x27;s &quot;Undercovers&quot; as its first new drama series for the 2010–11 season. However, it was subsequently cancelled by the network in November 2010.

===2010s===

Abrams wrote and directed the Paramount science fiction thriller &quot;Super 8&quot;, starring Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning, while co-producing with Steven Spielberg and Bryan Burk; it was released on June 10, 2011.

Abrams directed the sequel to &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot;, released in May 2013. The film was interpreted as a loose remake of &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;. Critics generally reacted positively to the film, while Nicholas Meyer, the director of &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot;, called it a &quot;gimmick&quot;. Abrams was criticized for the film&#x27;s treatment of classic villain Khan Noonien Singh (Benedict Cumberbatch). Many felt that much of the character, originally played by Mexican actor Ricardo Montalbán, had been lost, especially his ethnic identity. Two years after the film&#x27;s release, Abrams said of the film, &quot;there were certain things I was unsure of. ... Any movie ... has a fundamental conversation happening during it. And [for &quot;Into Darkness&quot;,] I didn&#x27;t have it... [The weakness of the plot] was not anyone&#x27;s fault but mine. ... [The script] was a little bit of a collection of scenes that were written by my friends ... And yet, I found myself frustrated by my choices, and unable to hang my hat on an undeniable thread of the main story. So then I found myself on that movie basically tap-dancing as well as I could to try and make the sequences as entertaining as possible. ... I would never say that I don&#x27;t think that the movie ended up working. But I feel like it didn&#x27;t work as well as it could have, had I made some better decisions before we started shooting.&quot;

On January 25, 2013, Disney and Lucasfilm introduced Abrams as director and producer of &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot;, the seventh entry in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; film saga, with Bryan Burk and Bad Robot producing the film. Following this news, speculation arose as to Abrams&#x27;s future with Paramount Pictures, under which he had released all of his previous feature work as a director, and which had a first-look deal with his company, Bad Robot. Paramount vice-chairman Rob Moore stated that Abrams would continue to have a hand in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot; franchises going forward.

Abrams directed, produced, and co-wrote the screenplay for &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;, which opened in theaters on December 18, 2015. Despite its strong box office performance and positive reviews, the film was considered by some, including &quot;Star Wars&quot; creator George Lucas, to be too similar to the original 1977 film. In 2016, Abrams responded towards these complaints, stating: &quot;What was important for me was introducing brand new characters using relationships that were embracing the history that we know to tell a story that is new — to go backwards to go forwards&quot;.

Abrams returned as producer for &quot;Star Trek Beyond&quot;, released in 2016. And also produced &quot;The Cloverfield Paradox&quot;, a sequel to &quot;10 Cloverfield Lane&quot;. It was released on Netflix in February 2018. Also on 2018, Abrams produced &quot;Overlord&quot;, a horror film set behind German enemy lines in World War II and directed by Julius Avery. Abrams also produced the fourth, fifth, and sixth &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot; films.

In September 2017, Abrams returned to direct and co-write &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot; with Chris Terrio. The film was released in December 2019; it received mixed reviews from critics and fans, while audience reactions were also mixed.

===2020s===
In September 2019, Abrams and his Bad Robot company signed a $250 million five-year deal with WarnerMedia, including HBO and Warner Bros. Pictures. In April 2020, it was announced that Abrams would be developing three new shows for HBO Max: &quot;Duster&quot;, &quot;Overlook&quot;, and &quot;Justice League Dark&quot;. Since then, the latter two have been scrapped.

Abrams was one of the producers of an animated short film of &quot;The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse&quot;, shown on BBC One and BBC iPlayer at Christmas 2022.

Abrams served as executive producer and co-creator of a new Batman animated series titled &quot;&quot; alongside Matt Reeves and Bruce Timm. The production team created eleven episodes which premiered August 1, 2024.

On May 8, 2024, it was announced that Abrams would write and direct an untitled new film, with Glen Powell in early talks to star in the project with Bad Robot signing on as the production company. The company&#x27;s five-year deal with Warner Bros. was also extended in August 2024, although it was expected to be less expensive than the previous agreement with future projects having significant budget cuts.

Future projects include &quot;Flowervale Street&quot;, a &quot;Hot Wheels&quot; film adaptation, and an animated film based on Dr. Seuss&#x27; &quot;Oh, the Places You&#x27;ll Go!&quot;.

=== Unrealized projects ===
In 1989, Abrams met Steven Spielberg at a film festival, where Spielberg spoke about a possible &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; sequel, with Abrams as a possible writer and with Robert Zemeckis as producer. Nothing came up from this project, although Abrams has some storyboards for a &quot;Roger Rabbit&quot; short.

In July 2002, Abrams wrote a script for a possible fifth Superman film entitled &quot;&quot;. Brett Ratner and McG entered into talks to direct, although Abrams tried to get the chance to direct his own script. However, the project was finally cancelled in 2004 and instead &quot;Superman Returns&quot; was released in 2006.

In November 2009, Abrams and Bad Robot Productions along with Cartoon Network Movies, Warner Bros., Frederator Films and Paramount Pictures, reportedly were producing a film adaptation of &quot;Samurai Jack&quot;. However, the production of the film was scrapped after Abrams&#x27; departure from the project to direct &quot;Star Trek&quot;. For this and other reasons, series creator Genndy Tartakovsky made a new season instead of a feature film. Also in 2009, Abrams and Bad Robot were reportedly set to produce a film based on the Micronauts toy line. However, the film has never gone into production.

In February 2018, HBO ordered Abrams&#x27; sci-fi drama &quot;Demimonde&quot; to series. In June 2022, the project was cancelled.

===Bad Robot===
In 2001, Abrams founded his own production company, Bad Robot, in association with Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros. Pictures. Initially a television production company under Touchstone Television, Bad Robot would branch out into film production, with the first movie to be produced under the Bad Robot name being &quot;Joy Ride&quot; (2001). Bad Robot is well known for &quot;Lost&quot;, the &quot;Star Trek&quot; Kelvin timeline films, the &quot;&quot; films excluding &quot;&quot;, the &quot;Cloverfield&quot; franchise, and the &quot;Star Wars&quot; sequel trilogy.

==Other work==
===Video game===
As of November 2015, a video game called &quot;Spyjinx&quot; was in development, with Abrams in a collaboration with Bad Robot and Chair Entertainment. A beta test was launched on April 2, 2020, by Epic Games.

===Books and comics===
On October 29, 2013, &quot;S.&quot;, a novel written by Doug Dorst based on a concept by Abrams, was released.

In 2019, Abrams made his debut as a writer for Marvel Comics, co-authoring the company&#x27;s title Spider-Man from September of that year with his son Henry. The first issue of the comic includes the death of Mary Jane Watson, and a twelve-year time shift, with the series&#x27; protagonist being Ben Parker, son of Peter Parker and Mary Jane.

==Personal life==
Abrams is married to public relations executive Katie McGrath and has three children. His daughter, Gracie Abrams, is a pop singer-songwriter. He resides in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, California. He is Jewish and his wife is Catholic, and he sometimes takes his children to religious services on Jewish holidays.

Abrams serves on the Creative Council of Represent.Us, a nonpartisan anti-corruption organization and the Motion Picture &amp; Television Fund (MPTF) Board of Governors. It was also reported that he attended the 2024 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.

In September 2024, Abrams signed a letter along with over 125 other Hollywood professionals urging California Governor Gavin Newsom to sign AI safety bill SB 1047.

<text>Out of the Silent Planet is a science fiction novel by the British author C. S. Lewis, first published in 1938 by John Lane, The Bodley Head. Two sequels were published in 1943 and 1945, completing the &quot;Space Trilogy&quot;. 

==Plot==
While on a walking tour, the philologist Elwin Ransom is drugged and taken on board a spacecraft bound for a planet called Malacandra. His abductors are Devine, a former college acquaintance, and the scientist Weston. Wonder and excitement relieve his anguish at being kidnapped, but he is put on his guard when he overhears his captors discussing their plans to turn him over to the inhabitants of Malacandra as a sacrifice. 

Soon after the three land, Ransom escapes and then runs off in terror upon first seeing the vaguely humanoid but alien &quot;sorns&quot;. In his wanderings, he finds that all the lakes, streams, and rivers are warm, that gravity is significantly lower than on Earth, and that the plants and mountains are all extremely tall and thin. After meeting a &quot;hross&quot; named Hyoi, a civilised native of a different species, Ransom becomes a guest for several weeks in Hyoi&#x27;s village, where he uses his philological skills to learn the language. Discovering that gold (known as &quot;sun&#x27;s blood&quot;), is plentiful on Malacandra, he discerns Devine&#x27;s motive for making the voyage.

While out hunting, Ransom and his &quot;hrossa&quot; companions are told by an &quot;eldil&quot;, an almost invisible, angelic creature, that Ransom must go to meet Oyarsa, who is ruler of the planet, and indeed that he should already have done so. Shortly after, Hyoi is shot dead by Devine and Weston as they track Ransom and Ransom is directed by the &quot;hrossa&quot; to comply with the eldil&#x27;s instructions and cross the mountains to the cave of a &quot;sorn&quot; named Augray. 

On the way Ransom discovers that he has almost reached the limit of breathable air and has to be revived by Augray with a flask of oxygen. The next day, carrying Ransom on his shoulder, Augray takes him across the bleak tableland and down into another river valley to Meldilorn, the island home of Oyarsa. There Ransom meets another species, a &quot;pfifltrigg&quot; who tells him about the beautiful houses and works of art that his people make in their native forests. 

Ransom is led to Oyarsa, who explains that there is an Oyarsa for each of the planets in the solar system. However, the Oyarsa of Earth – which is known as Thulcandra, &quot;the silent planet&quot; – has become &quot;bent&quot;, or evil, and has been restricted to Earth after &quot;a great war&quot; on the authority of Maleldil, the ruler of the universe. Ransom is ashamed at how little he can tell the Oyarsa of Malacandra about Earth, and how foolish he and other humans seem to Oyarsa. 

While the two are talking, Devine and Weston are brought in, guarded by &quot;hrossa&quot;, because they have killed three members of that species. Weston does not believe that Oyarsa exists and he is incapable of conceiving that the Malacandrians are anything but ignorant natives, exploitable and expendable. This emerges in the course of a long speech in which Weston justifies his proposed invasion of Malacandra on &quot;progressive&quot; and evolutionary grounds. Weston&#x27;s motives are shown to be more complex than profit: he is bent on expanding humanity through the universe, abandoning each planet and star system as its resources are exhausted and it becomes uninhabitable. In Ransom&#x27;s attempts at translation, the brutality and crudity of Weston&#x27;s ambitions are laid bare. 

While acknowledging that Weston is acting out of a sense of duty to his species and does not share Devine&#x27;s greed for gold, Oyarsa tells Weston and Devine that he cannot tolerate their disruptive presence on Malacandra. He directs them to leave the planet immediately, despite very unfavourable orbital conditions. Oyarsa offers Ransom the option of staying on Malacandra, but Ransom decides he does not belong there either. The three men voyage back to Earth in the spaceship, and their 90 days&#x27; worth of air and other supplies nearly run out before they arrive. 

In the final chapter, Lewis introduces himself as a character into his own novel. He had written to Ransom enquiring whether he had come across the Latin word &quot;Oyarses&quot;, discovered in a mediaeval Neoplatonist work. This prompts Ransom to share his secret and the two resolve to hinder Weston from doing further evil in view of &quot;the rapid march of [contemporary] events&quot;.

== Characters ==
*Dr Elwin Ransom – A professor of philology at a college of the University of Cambridge. 
*Dr Weston – A thick-set physicist, ruthless and arrogant, who mocks &quot;classics and history and such trash&quot; in favour of the hard sciences.
*Dick Devine – Weston&#x27;s accomplice who &quot;was quite ready to laugh at Weston&#x27;s solemn scientific idealism. He didn&#x27;t give a damn, he said, for the future of the species or the meeting of two worlds.&quot; 
*Hyoi – Ransom&#x27;s first &quot;hross&quot; contact.
*Hnohra – An older &quot;hross&quot; who acts as Ransom&#x27;s language teacher.
*Augray – A mountain-dwelling &quot;sorn&quot;.
*Kanakaberaka – A &quot;pfifltrigg&quot; who carves Ransom&#x27;s portrait onto a stone at Meldilorn.
*Oyarsa – The spirit ruler of Malacandra whose demand to meet a human before allowing further exploration of his planet precipitates the kidnapping of Ransom.

==Hrossa, séroni, and pfifltriggi==
On Malacandra there are three native species of reasoning &quot;hnau&quot;.

The hrossa (singular hross) resemble bipedal otters or seals, and they are somewhat taller and thinner than humans. Ransom finds them beautiful: &quot;covered, face and all, with thick black animal hair, and whiskered like a cat ... glossy coat, liquid eye, sweet breath and whitest teeth&quot;. They live in the low river valleys (&quot;handramit&quot; in the speech of the eldila), which they travel by boat, and specialise in farming, fishing, and such performing arts as dancing and poetry. Their technical level is low, and they wear only pocketed loincloths. Their speech is characterised by adding an initial /h/ sound to the words in the planet&#x27;s common vocabulary. Their sense of humour is &quot;extravagant and fantastic&quot;.

The séroni (singular sorn; the plural is sometimes given as sorns) are thin, humanoids having coats of pale feathers and seven-fingered hands. They live in mountain caves of the high country (&quot;harandra&quot; in the speech of the eldila), though they often descend into the &quot;handramit&quot; where they raise giraffe-like livestock. They are the scholars and thinkers of Malacandra, specializing in science and abstract learning. Their technical level is high, and they design machinery, which is built by the &quot;pfifltriggi&quot;. Although they can write, they do not compose written works of history or fiction as they feel the hrossa are superior at it. Their sense of humour &quot;seldom got beyond irony&quot;.

The pfifltriggi (singular pfifltrigg) have tapir-like heads and frog-like bodies; they lean their elbows on the ground when at rest, and sometimes when working with their hands. Their movements are quick and insectlike. They are the builders and technicians of Malacandra. They build houses and gadgets thought up by the séroni. They are miners who especially like to dig up &quot;sun&#x27;s blood&quot; (gold) and other useful and beautiful minerals. Their sense of humour is &quot;sharp and excelled in abuse&quot;.

Members of the three races do not believe any one of the races to be superior to the others; they acknowledge, rather, that no single race can do everything.

==Background==
Lewis wrote &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot; during 1937 after a conversation with J. R. R. Tolkien in which both men lamented the state of contemporary fiction. They agreed that Lewis would write a space travel story and Tolkien would write a time travel story. In fact, Tolkien never completed his story, while Lewis went on to compose two others over the war years in Britain. These three books are now referred to as the Cosmic or Space Trilogy, or occasionally as The Ransom trilogy after the main character, Elwin Ransom. 

Lewis was an early reader of H. G. Wells and had been given a copy of &quot;The First Men in the Moon&quot; as a Christmas present in 1908. Ransom makes dismissive references to Wells&#x27;s conceptions in the course of the novel, but Lewis himself prefaced early editions of the novel with the disclaimer that &quot;Certain slighting references to earlier stories of this type which will be found in the following pages have been put there for purely dramatic purposes. The author would be sorry if any reader supposed he was too stupid to have enjoyed Mr. H. G. Wells&#x27;s fantasies or too ungrateful to acknowledge his debt to them.&quot; Another early work of space fiction which he later acknowledged was David Lindsay&#x27;s &quot;A Voyage to Arcturus&quot; (1920).

But there were other speculative works in answer to which &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot; was written as a decided reaction. In both Olaf Stapledon&#x27;s &quot;Last and First Men&quot; (1930) and an essay in J. B. S. Haldane&#x27;s &quot;Possible Worlds&quot; (1927), Lewis detected what he termed Evolutionism, an amoral belief that humanity could perfect from itself a master race that would spread through the universe. Such was the ideology that Weston championed in his debate with Oyarsa, only to have it travestied by Ransom&#x27;s translation of it into Malacandran. 

In the end, very few of the novel&#x27;s original reviewers even realised that Lewis&#x27;s intent was to substitute theological values through its means for those he deplored on the side of Scientism. Noting this omission, he pointed out to one of his correspondents that &quot;any amount of theology can now be smuggled into people’s minds under cover of romance without their knowing it&quot;. In the novel itself, Ransom proposes a similar but subtler approach in his letter to Lewis quoted in the postscript: &quot;What we need for the moment is not so much a body of belief as a body of people familiarized with certain ideas. If we could even effect in one per cent of our readers a change-over from the conception of Space to the conception of Heaven, we should have made a beginning.&quot;

What Lewis actually offers as substitute views are a series of reversals. His Malacandra is in fact the planet Mars which, named after the Roman god of war, was once viewed astrologically as the influencer of self-assertion and disruption. However, in place of Wells&#x27;s scenario in &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, in which the inhabitants of Mars come to Earth as invaders, Lewis portrays a world of different species living in harmony from which members of his own corrupted species are expelled as bringers of violence and exploitation. Again, the clock is turned back from the world view of the post-mediaeval Renaissance to that of the Renaissance of the 12th century with the novel&#x27;s vision of the universe as &quot;the field of Heaven&quot; peopled by aetheric angels. It had been the aim of Lewis&#x27;s scholastic study &quot;The Allegory of Love&quot; (1936) to revalidate the standpoint of the mediaeval literature flowing from that time and a reference to one of its key authors is introduced as the reason for Lewis to contact Ransom in the first place. In Lewis&#x27;s study, the authors of the Platonic School of Chartres are presented as &quot;pioneers of medieval allegorical poetry…For them, Nature was not opposed to Grace but, rather, an instrument of Grace in opposing the Unnatural&quot;, which is one of the transformative ideas with which the novel&#x27;s readers are to be familiarized. Bernardus Silvestris&#x27;s study of the creation underpins Oyarsa&#x27;s discussion with Ransom in the novel.

==Weston&#x27;s speech and its translation==

The speech which Weston delivers at the book&#x27;s climax (in Chapter 20), and Ransom&#x27;s effort to render it into the language of Malacandra, demonstrates the gulf in cultural and moral perceptions between the planetary mind sets and may be said to make a sort of social criticism.

<doc id="337256" wikidata="Q678233" url="?curid=337256" title="Northeast Corridor">
<text>The Northeast Corridor (NEC) is an electrified railroad line in the Northeast megalopolis of the United States. Owned primarily by Amtrak, it runs from Boston in the north to Washington, D.C., in the south, with major stops in Providence, New Haven, Stamford, New York City, Newark, Trenton, Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore. The NEC is roughly paralleled by Interstate 95 for most of its length. Carrying more than 2,200 trains a day, it is the busiest passenger rail line in the United States by ridership and service frequency.

The corridor is used by many Amtrak trains, including the high-speed &quot;Acela&quot; (formerly &quot;Acela Express&quot;), intercity trains, and several long-distance trains. Most of the corridor also has frequent commuter rail service, operated by the MBTA, CT Rail, Metro-North Railroad, Long Island Rail Road, New Jersey Transit, SEPTA, and MARC. While large through freights have not run on the NEC since the early 1980s, some sections still carry smaller local freights operated by CSX, Norfolk Southern, CSAO, Providence and Worcester, New York and Atlantic, and Canadian Pacific. CSX and NS partly own their routes.

Long-distance Amtrak services that use the Northeast Corridor include the &quot;Cardinal&quot;, &quot;Crescent&quot;, and &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; trains, which reach , as well as its &quot;Acela&quot; trains, which reach in parts of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New Jersey. Some express trains operated by MARC that reach also operate on the Northeast Corridor. &quot;Acela&quot; can travel the between New York City and Washington, D.C., in under three hours, and the between New York and Boston in under 3.5 hours.

In 2012, Amtrak proposed improvements to enable &quot;true&quot; high-speed rail on the corridor, which would have roughly halved travel times at an estimated cost of $151 billion.

==History==

===Origins===

Most of what is now called the Northeast Corridor was built, piece by piece, by several railroads constructed as early as the 1830s. Before 1900, their routes had been consolidated as two long and unconnected stretches, each of them a part of a major railroad. Anchored in Washington, D.C., the stretch owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad, approached New York City from the south. Anchored at Boston, the stretch owned by the New Haven Railroad entered New York State from Connecticut. The former terminated at New Jersey ferry slips across the Hudson River from Manhattan Island. The latter extended to the Bronx, where it continued into Manhattan via trackage rights on the New York and Harlem Railroad. It also reached the Bronx via the Harlem River and Port Chester Railroad, which extended to the Bronx from the New Haven at New Rochelle.

From 1903 to 1917, the two railroads undertook a number of projects that connected their lines and completed, in effect, the Northeast Corridor. These included the New York Tunnel Extension, which extended from New Jersey to Long Island (and was composed of the Manhattan Transfer station, the North River Tunnels, a new Pennsylvania Station, the East River Tunnels), the New York Connecting Railroad, and the Hell Gate Bridge. Combined, these constituted a stretch that started just outside of Newark, New Jersey, on the Pennsylvania Railroad side, and connected with the Harlem River and Port Chester Railroad (and thus New Rochelle) on the New Haven side. With the opening of the Hell Gate Bridge in 1917, this final connecting stretch, and thus the Northeast Corridor itself, was complete.

With the 1968 creation of Penn Central, which was a combination of those two railroads and the New York Central Railroad, the entire corridor was under the control of a single entity for the first time. After successor Penn Central’s 1970 bankruptcy, the corridor was almost entirely subsumed by the subsequently-created Amtrak on May 1, 1971.

===Electrification, 1905–38===

====New York section====

In 1899, William J. Wilgus, the New York Central Railroad (NYC)&#x27;s chief engineer, proposed electrifying the lines leading from Grand Central Terminal and the split at Mott Haven, using a third rail power system devised by Frank J. Sprague. Electricity was in use on some branch lines of the NYNH&amp;H for interurban streetcars via third rail or trolley wire. An accident in the Park Avenue Tunnel near the present Grand Central Terminal that killed 17 people on January 8, 1902, was blamed on smoke from steam locomotives; the resulting outcry led to a push for electric operation in Manhattan.

The NH announced in 1905 that it would electrify its main line from New York to Stamford, Connecticut. Along with the construction of Grand Central Terminal, which was opened in 1913, the NYC electrified its lines. On September 30, 1906, the NYC conducted a test of suburban multiple unit service to Highbridge station on the Hudson Line; regular service began on December 11. Electric locomotives began serving Grand Central on February 15, 1907, and all NYC passenger service into Grand Central was electrified on July 1, 1907. NH electrification began in July to New Rochelle, August to Port Chester and October the rest of the way to Stamford. Steam trains last operated into Grand Central on June 30, 1908: the deadline after which steam trains were banned in Manhattan. Subsequently, all NH passenger trains into Manhattan were electrified. In June 1914, the NH electrification was extended to New Haven, which was the terminus of electrified service for over 80 years.

The PRR was building its Pennsylvania Station and electrified approaches, which were served by the PRR&#x27;s lines in New Jersey and the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR). LIRR electric service began in 1905 on the Atlantic Branch from downtown Brooklyn past Jamaica, and in June 1910 on the branch to Long Island City: part of the main line to Penn Station. Penn Station opened on September 8, 1910, for LIRR trains and November 27 for the PRR; trains of both railroads were powered by DC electricity from a third rail. PRR trains changed engines (electric to/from steam) at Manhattan Transfer; passengers could also transfer there to H&amp;M trains to downtown Manhattan.

On July 29, 1911, NH began electric service on its Harlem River Branch: a suburban branch that would become a main line with the completion of the New York Connecting Railroad and its Hell Gate Bridge. The bridge opened on March 9, 1917, but was operated by steam with an engine change at Sunnyside Yard east of Penn Station until 1918.
&lt;br&gt;

Electrification north of New Haven to Providence and Boston had been planned by the NH, and authorized by the company&#x27;s board of directors shortly before the United States entered World War I. This plan was not carried out because of the war and the company&#x27;s financial problems. Electrification north of New Haven did not occur until the 1990s, by Amtrak, using a 60 Hz system.

====New York to Washington electrification====
In 1905, the PRR began to electrify its suburban lines at Philadelphia: an effort that eventually led to 11 kV, 25 Hz AC catenary from New York and Washington. Electric service began in September 1915, with multiple unit trains west to Paoli on the PRR Main Line (now the Keystone Corridor). Electric service to Chestnut Hill (now the Chestnut Hill West Line), including a stretch of the NEC, began on March 30, 1918. Local electric service to Wilmington, Delaware, on the NEC began on September 30, 1928, and to Trenton, New Jersey, on June 29, 1930.

Electrified service between Exchange Place, the Jersey City terminal, and New Brunswick, New Jersey, began on December 8, 1932, including the extension of Penn Station electric service from Manhattan Transfer. On January 16, 1933, the rest of the electrification between New Brunswick and Trenton opened, giving a fully-electrified line between New York and Wilmington. Trains to Washington began running under electricity to Wilmington on February 12, 1933, with the engine-change moved from Manhattan Transfer to Wilmington. The same was done on April 9, 1933, for trains running west from Philadelphia, with the change point moved to Paoli.

In 1933, the electrification south of Wilmington was stalled by the Great Depression, but the PRR got a loan from the Public Works Administration to resume work. The tunnels at Baltimore were rebuilt as part of the project. Electric service between New York and Washington began on February 10, 1935. On April 7, the electrification of passenger trains was complete, with 639 daily trains: 191 hauled by locomotives and the other 448 under multiple-unit power. New York–Washington electric freight service began on May 20, 1935, after the electrification of freight lines in New Jersey and Washington,DC. Extensions to Potomac Yard across the Potomac River from Washington, as well as several freight branches along the way, were electrified in 1937 and 1938. The Potomac Yard retained its electrification until 1981.

====Re-signaling====
In the 1930s, PRR equipped the New York–Washington line with Pulse code cab signaling. Between 1998 and 2003, this system was overlaid with an Alstom Advanced Civil Speed Enforcement System (ACSES), using track-mounted transponders similar to the Balises of the modern European Train Control System. The ACSES will enable Amtrak to implement positive train control to comply with the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008.

===Founding and operation of Amtrak===

====Reorganization and bankruptcy====

In December 1967, the UAC TurboTrain set a speed record for a production train: between New Brunswick and Trenton, New Jersey.

In February 1968, PRR merged with its rival New York Central Railroad to form the Penn Central (PC). Penn Central was required to absorb the New Haven in 1969 as a condition of the merger.

On September 21, 1970, all New York–Boston trains except the &quot;Turboservice&quot; were rerouted into Penn Station from Grand Central; the &quot;Turboservice&quot; moved on February 1, 1971, for cross-platform transfers to the Metroliners.

In 1971, Amtrak began operations, and various state governments took control of portions of the NEC for their commuter transportation authorities. In January, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts bought the Attleboro/Stoughton Line in Massachusetts, later operated by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. The same month, the New York State Metropolitan Transportation Authority bought, and Connecticut leased, from Penn Central their sections of the New Haven Line, between Woodlawn, New York, and New Haven, Connecticut.

In 1973, the Regional Rail Reorganization Act opened the way for Amtrak to buy sections of the NEC not already been sold to these commuter transportation authorities. These purchases by Amtrak were controversial at the time, and the Department of Transportation blocked the transaction and withheld purchase funds for several months until Amtrak granted it control over reconstruction of the corridor.

In February 1975, the Preliminary System Plan for Conrail proposed to stop running freight trains on the NEC between Groton, Connecticut, and Hillsgrove, Rhode Island, but this clause was rejected the following month by the U.S. Railway Association.

By April 1976, Amtrak owned the entire NEC except Boston to the RI state line, which is owned by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and New Haven to New Rochelle, New York, which is owned by the States of Connecticut and New York. Amtrak still operates and maintains the portion in Massachusetts, but the line from New Haven to New Rochelle, New York, is operated by the Metro-North Railroad, which has hindered the establishment of high-speed service.

====Northeast Corridor Improvement Project====

In 1976, Congress authorized an overhaul of the system between Washington and Boston. Called the Northeast Corridor Improvement Project (NECIP), it included safety improvements, modernization of the signaling system by General Railway Signal, and new Centralized Electrification and Traffic Control (CETC) control centers by Chrysler at Philadelphia, New York and Boston. It allowed more trains to run faster and closer together, and set the stage for later high-speed operation. NECIP also introduced the AEM-7 locomotive, which lowered travel times and became the most successful engine on the Corridor. The NECIP set travel time goals of 2 hours and 40 minutes between Washington and New York, and 3 hours and 40 minutes between Boston and New York. These goals were not met because of the low level of funding provided by the Reagan Administration and Congress in the 1980s.

Electrification between New Haven and Boston was to be included in the 1976 Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act.

The last grade crossings between New York and Washington were closed about 1985; eleven grade crossings remain in Connecticut.

====1990s implementation of high-speed rail====
In the 1990s, Amtrak upgraded the NEC north of New Haven, CT to get it ready for the high-speed &quot;Acela Express&quot; trains. Dubbed the Northeast High Speed Rail Improvement Program (NHRIP), the effort eliminated grade crossings, rebuilt bridges and modified curves. Concrete railroad ties replaced wood ties, and heavier continuous welded rail (CWR) was laid-down.

In 1996, Amtrak began installing electrification gear along the of track between New Haven and Boston. The infrastructure included a new overhead catenary wire made of high-strength silver-bearing copper, specified by Amtrak and later patented by Phelps Dodge Specialty Copper Products of Elizabeth, New Jersey.

====2000–present====

Service with electric locomotives between New Haven and Boston began on January 31, 2000. The project took four years and cost close to $2.3 billion: $1.3 billion for the infrastructure improvements and close to $1 billion for both the new Acela Express trainsets and the Bombardier–Alstom HHP-8 locomotives.

On December 11, 2000, Amtrak began operating its higher-speed &quot;Acela Express&quot; service. Fastest travel time by &quot;Acela&quot; is three and a half hours between Boston and New York, and two hours forty-five minutes between New York and Washington, D.C.

In 2005, there was talk in Congress of splitting the Northeast Corridor, which was opposed by then-acting Amtrak president David Gunn. The plan, supported by the Bush administration, would &quot;turn over the Northeast Corridor – the tracks from Washington to Boston that are the railroad&#x27;s main physical asset – to a federal-state consortium.&quot;

With the passage of the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008, the Congress established the Northeast Corridor Commission (NEC Commission) in the U.S. Department of Transportation to facilitate mutual cooperation and planning and to advise Congress on Corridor rail and development policy. The commission members include USDOT, Amtrak and the Northeast Corridor states.

In October 2010, Amtrak released &quot;A Vision for High-Speed Rail on the Northeast Corridor,&quot; an aspirational proposal for dedicated high-speed rail tracks between Washington, D.C., and Boston. Many of these proposals are unfunded.

In August 2011 the United States Department of Transportation committed $450 million to a six-year project to support capacity increases on one of the busiest segments on the NEC: a section between New Brunswick and Trenton, passing through Princeton Junction. The Next Generation High-Speed project is designed to upgrade electrical power, signal systems and overhead catenary wires to improve reliability and increase speeds up to , and, after the purchase of new equipment, up to . In September 2012, speed tests were conducted using &quot;Acela&quot; trainsets, achieving a speed of . The improvements were scheduled to be completed in 2016, but, due to delays, the project had not been completed until 2020.

In 2012, the Federal Railroad Administration began developing a master plan for bringing high-speed rail to the Northeast Corridor titled NEC FUTURE, and released the final environmental impact statement in December 2016. Multiple potential alignments north of New York City were studied. The proposed upgrades have not been funded.

=====2015 derailment=====
Eleven minutes after leaving 30th Street Station in Philadelphia on May 12, 2015, a year-old ACS-64 locomotive (#601) and all seven Amfleet I coaches of Amtrak&#x27;s northbound &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; (TR#188) derailed at 9:21pm at Frankford Junction in the Port Richmond section of the city, while entering a speed limited (but at the time non-ATC protected) 4° curve at , killing eight and injuring more than 200 (eight critically) of the 238 passengers and five crew on board as well as causing the suspension of all Philadelphia–New York NEC service for six days.

This was the deadliest crash on the Northeast Corridor since 16 died when Amtrak&#x27;s Washington–Boston &quot;Colonial&quot; (TR#94) rear-ended three stationary Conrail locomotives at near Baltimore on January 4, 1987. Frankford Junction curve was the site of a previous fatal accident on September 6, 1943, when an extra section of the PRR&#x27;s Washington to New York &quot;Congressional Limited&quot; derailed there, killing 79 and injuring 117 of the 541 on board.

== Infrastructure ==

The NEC is a cooperative venture between Amtrak and various state agencies. Amtrak owns the track between Washington and New Rochelle, New York, a northern suburb of New York City. The segment from New Rochelle to New Haven is owned by the states of New York and Connecticut; Metro-North Railroad commuter trains operate there. Amtrak owns the tracks north of New Haven to the border between Rhode Island and Massachusetts. The final segment from the border north to Boston is owned by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

===Electrification===

At just over , the Northeast Corridor is the longest electrified rail corridor in the United States. Most electrified railways in the country are for rapid transit or commuter rail use; the Keystone Corridor is the only other electrified intercity mainline.

Currently, the corridor uses three catenary systems. From Washington, D.C., to Sunnyside Yard (just east of New York Penn Station), Amtrak&#x27;s 25 Hz traction power system (originally built by the Pennsylvania Railroad) supplies 12 kV at 25 Hz. From Sunnyside to Mill River (just east of New Haven station), the former New Haven Railroad&#x27;s system, since modified by Metro-North, supplies 12.5 kV at 60 Hz. From Mill River to Boston, the much newer 60 Hz traction power system supplies 25 kV at 60 Hz. All of Amtrak&#x27;s electric locomotives can switch between these systems.

In addition to catenary, the East River Tunnels have 750 V DC third rail for Long Island Rail Road trains, and the North River Tunnels have third rail for emergency use only.

In 2006, several high-profile electric-power failures delayed Amtrak and commuter trains on the Northeast Corridor up to five hours. Railroad officials blamed Amtrak&#x27;s funding woes for the deterioration of the track and power supply system, which in places is almost a hundred years old. These problems have decreased in recent years after tracks and power systems were repaired and improved.

In September 2013, one of two feeder lines supplying power to the New Haven Line failed, while the other feeder was disabled for service. The lack of electrical power disrupted trains on Amtrak and Metro-North Railroad, which share the segment in New York State.

=== Stations ===
There are 109 active stations on the Northeast Corridor; 30 are used by Amtrak. All but three (, , and ) see commuter service. Amtrak owns Pennsylvania Station in New York, 30th Street Station in Philadelphia, Penn Station in Baltimore, and Union Station in Washington.

The main services of the Northeast Corridor are indicated using the following abbreviations. Other services are listed in the right-most column. Note that not all trains necessarily stop at all indicated stations.
* Amtrak corridor: A (&quot;Acela&quot;), KS (&quot;Keystone Service&quot;), NR (&quot;Northeast Regional&quot;), PA (), VT ()
* Amtrak long distance: CD (), CL (), CS (), PL (), SM (&quot;Silver Meteor&quot;)

===Grade crossings===

The entire Northeast Corridor has 11 grade crossings, all in southeastern New London County, Connecticut. The remaining grade crossings are along a part of the line that hugs the shore of Long Island Sound. Some of these crossings constitute the only points of access to waterfront communities and businesses otherwise disconnected from the road network. As such, eliminating them would require grade separation to maintain access. Six of the grade crossings have four-quadrant gates with induction loop sensors, which allow vehicles stopped on the tracks to be detected in time for an oncoming train to stop. The remaining five grade crossings, 3 near New London Union Station and two in Stonington, have dual gates.

FRA rules limit track speeds on the corridor to over conventional crossings and over crossings with four-quadrant gates and vehicle detection tied into the signal system.

====History====
The New York to New Haven line has long been completely grade-separated, and the last grade crossings between Washington and New York were eliminated in the 1980s. In 1994, during planning for electrification and high-speed &quot;Acela Express&quot; service between New Haven and Boston, a law was passed requiring USDOT to plan for the elimination of all remaining crossings (unless impractical or unnecessary) by 1997. Some lightly used crossings were simply closed, while most were converted into bridges or underpasses. Only thirteen remained by 1999, of which lightly used crossings in Old Lyme, Connecticut, and Exeter, Rhode Island, were soon closed.

Despite six nonfatal accidents in the previous sixteen years, there was substantial local opposition to closing the remaining 11 crossings. Outright closing the crossing would eliminate the sole access points to several of the places they served, while grade separation would be expensive and require land takings. Instead, the crossings were supplied with additional protections. In 1998, School Street in Groton was the first four-quadrant gate installation in the country with vehicle detection sensors tied into the line&#x27;s signal system. It cost $1 million rather than the $4 million for a bridge. Seven more crossings received similar installations in 1999 and 2000; only the three in New London (which are on a tight curve with speed limits under ) did not.

On September 28, 2005, a southbound &quot;Acela Express&quot; struck a car at Miner Lane in Waterford, Connecticut, the first such incident since the additional protections were implemented. The train was approaching the crossing at approximately when the car reportedly rolled under the lowered crossing gate arms too late for the sensor system to fully stop the train. The driver and one passenger were killed on impact; the other passenger died nine days later from injuries sustained in the crash. The gates were later inspected and declared to have been functioning properly at the time of the incident. The incident drew public criticism about the remaining grade crossings along the busy line.

===Intercity passenger services===

In 2003, Amtrak accounted for about 14% of intercity trips between the cities served by the NEC and its branches (the rest were taken by airline, automobile, or bus). A 2011 study estimated that in 2010 Amtrak carried 6% of the Boston–Washington traffic, compared to 80% for automobiles, 8–9% for intercity bus, and 5% for airlines. Amtrak&#x27;s share of the air or rail passenger traffic between New York City and Boston has grown from 20 percent to 54 percent since 2001, and 75 percent between New York City and Washington, D.C.

These Amtrak trains serve NEC stations and run at least partially on the corridor:
* &quot;Acela&quot;: high-speed rail Boston–Washington, D.C.
* &quot;Cardinal&quot;: New York–Chicago via Washington, D.C. (Wednesdays, Fridays, &amp; Sundays only)
* &quot;Carolinian&quot;: New York–Charlotte, North Carolina
* &quot;Crescent&quot;: New York–New Orleans
* &quot;Keystone Service&quot;: higher-speed rail Harrisburg, Pennsylvania – New York
* &quot;Northeast Regional&quot;: higher-speed rail (This service qualifies as high speed rail on the 125mph stretch between New Brunswick and Princeton Junction.) Boston/Springfield/New York–Washington D.C./Richmond/Newport News/Norfolk/Roanoke, Virginia
* &quot;Palmetto&quot;: Savannah, Georgia – New York
* &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot;: Pittsburgh–New York via NEC and Philadelphia to Harrisburg Main Line
* &quot;Silver Meteor&quot;: Miami–New York
* &quot;Vermonter&quot;: St. Albans, Vermont – Washington, D.C., via NEC and New Haven–Springfield Line

Seven other Amtrak trains terminate at NEC stations, but do not use any NEC infrastructure outside the terminus:

* Amtrak &quot;Hartford Line&quot;: operated in conjunction with ConnDOT, runs across Amtrak-owned New Haven–Springfield line from Springfield Union to New Haven Union, the latter of which uses NEC infrastructure.

Six Amtrak services operate via the Empire Corridor, a line largely owned by CSX, with other sections owned by Metro-North Railroad and Amtrak. It meets the NEC at New York Penn Station.
* &quot;Adirondack&quot;: runs from New York Penn to Montreal Central
* &quot;Berkshire Flyer&quot;: higher-speed rail from New York Penn to Albany–Rensselaer and the Joseph Scelsi Intermodal Transportation Center in Pittsfield, Massachusetts
* &quot;Empire Service&quot;: higher-speed rail from New York Penn to Albany–Rensselaer and Niagara Falls
* &quot;Ethan Allen Express&quot;: runs from Burlington Union to New York Penn
* &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot;: runs from Chicago Union to New York Penn; also has a branch to the NEC&#x27;s terminus at Boston South
* &quot;Maple Leaf&quot;: runs from New York Penn to Toronto Union

The , which travels between Chicago Union and Miami, intersects with the Northeast Corridor at Washington Union.

Due to the wide availability of the &quot;Northeast Regional&quot;, &quot;Keystone Service&quot;, and &quot;Acela&quot;, as well as commuter rail, most long- and medium-haul trains operating along the New York-Washington leg of the NEC do not allow local travel between NEC stations. In most cases, long- and medium-haul trains only stop to discharge passengers from Washington (and in some cases, Alexandria) northward, and to receive passengers from Newark to Washington. This policy is intended to keep seats available for passengers making longer trips. The &quot;Vermonter&quot; and &quot;Palmetto&quot; are the only medium- and long-haul trains that allow local travel in both directions between New York and Washington. The southbound &quot;Carolinian&quot; allows local travel daily, while the northbound &quot;Carolinian&quot; only allows local travel on Sundays, Thursdays, and Fridays. Additionally, the medium-haul &quot;Pennsylvanian&quot; allows local NEC travel, but this train leaves the corridor in Philadelphia and does not travel all the way to Washington.

===Commuter rail===

In addition to Amtrak, several commuter rail agencies operate passenger service using the NEC tracks:

====Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA)====
* Providence/Stoughton Line: Wickford Junction–Boston
* Franklin/Foxboro Line: Readville–Boston
* Needham Line: Forest Hills–Boston
* Framingham/Worcester Line: Back Bay Station–Boston

The only section north of New York that does not have commuter service is the 43 miles between Wickford Junction and New London.

==== CT Rail ====
* Hartford Line: New Haven Union Station–New Haven-State Street
*Shore Line East: Stamford–New London, Connecticut

==== Metro-North Railroad (MNRR) ====
* New Haven Line: New Rochelle, New York–New Haven, Connecticut
* Danbury Branch: Stamford–Norwalk, Connecticut
* Waterbury Branch: Bridgeport–Stratford, Connecticut

====Long Island Rail Road (LIRR)====
* City Terminal Zone: Sunnyside Yard, Queens–New York

====New Jersey Transit (NJT)====

* Northeast Corridor Line: Trenton, NJ–New York
* North Jersey Coast Line: Rahway, NJ–New York
* Morristown Line, Gladstone Branch, Montclair-Boonton Line: Kearny Connection–New York
* Raritan Valley Line: Hunter Connection–New York
* Atlantic City Line: 30th Street Station–Frankford Junction

====SEPTA====
* Trenton Line: Philadelphia–Trenton, New Jersey
* Airport Line: 30th Street Station–Southwest Philadelphia
* Media/Wawa Line: 30th Street Station–Arsenal Junction
* Chestnut Hill West Line: 30th Street Station–North Philadelphia Station
* Wilmington/Newark Line: Newark, Delaware–Philadelphia

====MARC Train====
* Penn Line: Washington, D.C.–Perryville, Maryland, via Baltimore Penn Station

===Freight services===

Freight trains operate on parts of the NEC through trackage rights. Prior to the 1970s when Amtrak took over all passenger service, the NEC routinely saw lengthy freight trains sometimes numbering over one hundred cars traversing great lengths of the corridor. All freight operations ultimately came under the control of Penn Central in the late 1960s and later Conrail upon its formation in 1976, however Amtrak, whose ridership was steadily increasing began demanding heavier taxes for longer trains. Ultimately Conrail began reducing freight service to only small, local trains on certain sections of the corridor where most needed once longer freights began causing congestion and bigger delays with passenger service.

Currently, Norfolk Southern Railway operates over the line south of Philadelphia. CSX Transportation has rights from New York to New Haven; in Massachusetts; and in Maryland from Landover, where its Landover Subdivision joins the NEC, to Bowie, where its Pope&#x27;s Creek Subdivision leaves it. Between Philadelphia and New York, Conrail Shared Assets Operations operates as a local switching and terminal company for CSX and Norfolk Southern. The Providence and Worcester Railroad operates local freight service from New Haven into Rhode Island and has overhead trackage rights from New Haven to New York over the Hell Gate Bridge to Fresh Pond Junction. Additionally, the Canadian Pacific Kansas City and the New York and Atlantic Railway both have trackage rights over the Hell Gate Bridge in order to connect with their own routes near New York. 
==Future NEC projects==

===Gateway Program===
In February 2011, Amtrak announced plans for the Gateway Project between Newark Penn Station and New York Penn Station. The planned project would create a high-speed alignment across the New Jersey Meadowlands and under the Hudson River, including the replacement of the Portal Bridge, a bottleneck.

===Harold Interlocking===

In May 2011, a $294.7-million federal grant was awarded to fix congestion at Harold Interlocking, the USA&#x27;s second-busiest rail junction after Sunnyside Yard. The work will lay tracks to the New York Connecting Railroad right of way, allowing Amtrak trains arriving from or bound for New England to avoid NJ Transit and Long Island Rail Road trains. Financing for the project was jeopardized in July 2011 by the House of Representatives, which voted to divert the funding to unrelated projects. The project was then funded by FRA and the MTA. , the interlocking is being reconstructed for LIRR&#x27;s East Side Access project.

=== New Brunswick–Trenton high-speed upgrade ===
In August 2011, Congress obligated $450 million to a six-year project to add capacity on one of the busiest segments on the NEC in New Jersey. The project is designed to upgrade electrical power, signal systems and catenary wires on a section between New Brunswick and Trenton to improve reliability, increase speeds up to , and support more frequent high-speed service. The improvements were scheduled to be completed in 2016, but have been delayed repeatedly. The track work is one of several projects planned for the &quot;New Jersey Speedway&quot; section of the NEC, which include a new station at North Brunswick, the Mid-Line Loop (a flyover for reversing train direction), and the re-construction of County Yard, to be done in coordination with NJ Transit. &quot;Acela&quot; trains began operating at speeds up to between Princeton Junction and New Brunswick in June 2022. With the planned introduction of the Avelia Liberty in 2025, speeds will increase to .

===New trains for Acela===

On August 26, 2016, Vice President Joe Biden announced a $2.45 billion federal loan package to pay for new &quot;Acela&quot; equipment and upgrades to the NEC. The loans will finance 28 trainsets to replace the existing fleet. The trains are being built by Alstom in Hornell and Rochester, New York. Passenger service using the new trains had been expected to begin in 2024, but as of December 2024 the start date had been pushed to the spring of 2025. The current fleet is expected to be retired when all the replacements have been delivered. Amtrak plans to repay the loans through increased NEC passenger revenue.

===Connecticut speed upgrade===
The Connecticut Department of Transportation plans to replace a three-mile stretch of track in Bridgeport, Stratford, and Milford, including the reconstruction of eight bridges (one in Bridgeport and seven in Stratford), catenary replacement, the reconstruction of one interlocking for high-speed track changes, and the construction of an additional new high-speed interlocking. These improvements will allow Metro-North and Amtrak trains to travel at instead of the current limit. The $385 million project is planned to begin in 2025, with completion estimated in December 2028.

===Replacement of bridge over Housatonic River===

In Milford and Stratford, Connecticut, the 1906 Devon Bridge over the Housatonic River causes delays and speed restrictions. The four-track bascule bridge is planned to be rehabilitated and eventually replaced, improving reliability and reducing travel times. The Connecticut Department of Transportation was awarded $119.3 million for interim repairs to the bridge in 2023. Repairs are scheduled to run from June 2025 until June 2027. A new bridge to replace the existing span is to be built from October 2030 to August 2036. Amtrak was awarded up to $246 million in Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act funds in November 2023 for the design of a replacement for the span. Amtrak will contribute an additional $16 million, while the state of Connecticut will provide $45 million. The replacement bridge is being designed for a top speed of , up from the current limit on the existing bridge.

===Replacement of bridge over Hutchinson River===

Amtrak is planning to replace the 1907 low-level movable rail Pelham Bay Bridge (just west of Pelham Bridge) over the Hutchinson River in the Bronx that has been limiting speed and train capacity. The goal is for a new bridge to support expanded service and speeds up to . Construction is anticipated to begin in 2029, with completion expected in 2034. Funding for the replacement bridge will be provided by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.

===Replacement of bridge over Norwalk River===

In May 2023, construction began to replace the 1896 Walk Bridge, a swing bridge over the Norwalk River in Norwalk, Connecticut. The current bridge is a frequent point of failure and a source of speed restrictions for Amtrak and Metro-North trains. The replacement bridge, a dual-span lift bridge, is expected to be completed in 2029. The replacement bridge is designed for a speed increase of . Amtrak was awarded $465 million in Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act funds in November 2023. Amtrak will contribute an additional $27 million, while the state of Connecticut will provide $87 million.

===Replacement of bridge over Saugatuck River===

In Westport, Connecticut, the 1905-built Saugatuck River Bridge over the Saugatuck River is planned to be replaced with a new span, as the current four-track bascule bridge is a source of delays and speed restrictions. Construction on the replacement bridge is expected to last from January 2030 to October 2033. The replacement bridge is being designed for a top speed of , up from the current limit on the existing bridge. Amtrak was awarded up to $23.2 million in Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act funds in November 2023 for early design of a replacement for the span. Amtrak will contribute an additional $1.6 million, while the state of Connecticut will provide $4.2 million.

<doc id="337261" wikidata="Q61292" url="?curid=337261" title="Far Eastern Republic">
<text>The Far Eastern Republic (; ), sometimes called the Chita Republic (, ), was a nominally independent state that existed from April 1920 to November 1922 in the easternmost part of the Russian Far East. Although nominally independent, it largely came under the control of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), which envisaged it as a buffer state between the RSFSR and the territories occupied by Japan during the Russian Civil War of 1917–1922. The Far Eastern Republic came to an end in November 1922 when it voluntarily merged with the RSFSR. Its first president was Alexander Krasnoshchyokov.

The Far Eastern Republic occupied the territory of modern Zabaykalsky Krai, Amur Oblast, the Jewish Autonomous Oblast, Khabarovsk Krai, and Primorsky Krai of Russia (the former Transbaikal and Amur oblasts and Primorsky krai). Its capital was established at Verkhneudinsk (now Ulan-Ude), but in October 1920 it moved to Chita.

The Red Army occupied Vladivostok on 25 October 1922. Three weeks later, on 15 November 1922, the Far Eastern Republic merged with the RSFSR.

==History==
===Establishment===
The Far Eastern Republic was established in the later stages of the Russian Civil War. During the Civil War local authorities generally controlled the towns and cities of the Russian Far East, cooperating to a greater or lesser extent with the White Siberian government of Alexander Kolchak and with the succeeding invading forces of the Japanese Army. When the Japanese evacuated the Trans-Baikal and Amur oblasts in the spring of 1920, a political vacuum resulted.

A new central authority was established at Chita to govern the Far Eastern Republic remaining in the Japanese wake. The Far Eastern Republic was established comprising only the area around Verkhneudinsk, but during the summer of 1920, the Soviet government of the Amur territory agreed to join.

The Far Eastern Republic was formed two months after Kolchak&#x27;s death with the tacit support of the government of Soviet Russia, which saw it as a temporary buffer state between the RSFSR and the territories occupied by Japan. Many members of the Russian Communist Party had disagreed with the decision to allow a new government in the region, believing that their approximately 4,000 members were capable of seizing power in their own right. However, Vladimir Lenin and other party leaders in Moscow felt that the approximately 70,000 Japanese and 12,000 American troops might regard such an action as a provocation, which might spur a further attack that the Soviet Republic could ill afford.

On 1 April 1920, the American Expeditionary Force, Siberia headed by General William S. Graves departed Siberia, leaving the Japanese the sole occupying power in the region with whom the Bolsheviks were forced to deal. This detail did not change the basic equation for the Bolshevik government in Moscow, however, which continued to see the establishment of a Far Eastern Republic as a sort of Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in the east, providing the regime with a necessary breathing space that would allow it to recover economically and militarily.

On 6 April 1920, a hastily convened Constituent Assembly gathered at Verkhneudinsk and proclaimed the establishment of the Far Eastern Republic. Promises were made that the republic&#x27;s new constitution would guarantee free elections under the principles of universal, direct, and equal suffrage and that foreign investment in the country would be encouraged.

The Far Eastern Republic, controlled by moderate socialists, was only grudgingly recognized by the various cities of the region towards the end of 1920. Violence, atrocities, and reprisals continued to erupt periodically for the next 18 months. One such example occurred at the Korean enclave Shinhanchon, where Korean civilians were massacred by Japanese soldiers.

Japan agreed to recognize the new buffer state in a truce with the Red Army signed on 15 July 1920, effectively abandoning Ataman Grigory Semenov and his Russia Eastern Outskirts. By October Semenov had been expelled from his base of operations in Chita. With Semenov out of the picture, the capital of the Far Eastern Republic moved to that city.

On 11 November 1920 a provisional national assembly for the Far East met in Vladivostok. The gathering recognized the government at Chita and set 9 January 1921 as the date for new elections for the Constituent Assembly of the Far Eastern Republic. A new constitution closely resembling the United States Constitution was written and approved on 27 April 1921.

===The 1921 coup===
However, right-wing elements rejected the idea of a fledgling democratic republic in the Russian Far East. On 26 May 1921 a White coup took place in Vladivostok, backed by Japanese occupying forces. A &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; of Japanese troops protected the insurgents, who established a new régime, the Provisional Government of the Priamur,
in the Primorskaya Oblast. Shortly after the coup, Kolchak&#x27;s designated successor, Ataman Semenov, arrived in Vladivostok and attempted to proclaim himself commander-in-chief—an effort which failed when his Japanese benefactors forsook him.

The new Provisional Government of the Priamur attempted—with little success—to rally the various anti-Bolshevik forces to its banner. Its leaders, two Vladivostok businessmen—the brothers Spiridon Merkulov and —found themselves left isolated when the Japanese Army announced on 24 June 1922 that it would remove all of its troops from Siberia by the end of October. A July 1922 &quot;Zemsky sobor&quot; deposed the Merkulov brothers and named a Russian general who had served with the Czechoslovak Legion, M.K. Dieterichs, as military dictator.

=== FER victory and demise, 1922 ===
With the Japanese exiting the country throughout the summer of 1922, panic swept through the White Russian insurgents. As the Red Army, thinly disguised as the , moved eastwards, thousands of Russians, including Dieterichs and his remaining troops, fled abroad to escape the new régime. The army of the Far Eastern Republic retook Vladivostok on 25 October 1922, effectively bringing the Russian Civil War to a close.

With the Civil War finally over, Soviet Russia absorbed the Far Eastern Republic on 15 November 1922. The government of the Far Eastern Republic dissolved itself and transferred all its authority and territory to the Bolshevik government in Moscow.

=== Aftermath ===
Japan retained the northern half of Sakhalin Island until 1925, ostensibly as compensation for Nikolayevsk incident - the massacre of about 700 Japanese civilians and soldiers at Nikolaevsk-na-Amure in May-June 1920. This &quot;compensatory&quot; motive for holding the territory belied the fact that Japanese retaliation for the actions of Russian partisans had taken between two and three times as many Russian lives.

==Territory and resources==
The Far Eastern Republic consisted of four provinces of the former Russian empire—Trans-Baikal, Amur, the Maritime Province, and the northern half of Sakhalin island. Primarily, it represented the boundaries of the regions of Transbaikal and Outer Manchuria. The frontiers of the short-lived nation followed the western coastline of Lake Baikal along the northern borders of Mongolia and Manchuria to the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk.

The total area of the Far Eastern Republic was reckoned at approximately and its population at about 3.5 million people. Of these an estimated 1.62 million were ethnic Russians and just over 1 million were of Asian extraction, with family lineages originating in China, Japan, Mongolia, and Korea.

The Far Eastern Republic was an area of substantial mineral wealth, including territory which produced about one-third of the entire Russian output of gold as well as that country&#x27;s only source of domestically produced tin. Other mineral reserves of the Far Eastern Republic included zinc, iron, and coal.

The fishing industry of the former Maritime Province was substantial, with a total catch exceeding that of Iceland and featuring ample stocks of herring, salmon, and sturgeon. The Republic also boasted extensive forestry resources, including over of harvestable pine, fir, cedar, poplar, and birch.

== People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army ==
Оn 20 July 1922, the 104th Balagansk Rifle Brigade was reorganized into the 1st Transbaikal Rifle Division of the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army of the Far Eastern Republic. The division defended the border with Manchuria from its formation, and between 4 and 25 October took part in the Primorsky operation to defeat the Zemskaya Rat, the last remnants of the Whites in the Far East. During the operation, the 1st Transbaikal Rifle Division fought in the capture of Grodekovo, Nikolsk-Ussuriysky, and Vladivostok. 

The 5th Army (fourth formation) was created by order of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee of the RSFSR of November 16, 1922 by renaming the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army of the Far Eastern Republic. The 1st Transbaikal Rifle Division came under its command. It was based at Vladivostok. In honor of its defeat of White troops on the shores of Pacific and basing on the Pacific coast, the division was redesignated the 1st Pacific Rifle Division () on 22 November 1922.

<text>John Christopher Pratt (December 9, 1935 – June 5, 2022) was one of Canada&#x27;s most prominent painters and printmakers. In addition to a body of highly acclaimed paintings, prints, drawings and writing, he designed the flag of Newfoundland and Labrador.

==Early life and education==
Pratt was born in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, on December 9, 1935. He first started painting watercolours in 1952 and won the provincial government&#x27;s Arts and Letters Competition for his piece titled &quot;Shed in a Storm&quot;. He initially studied pre-engineering at Memorial University of Newfoundland in the autumn of 1952 before relocating to New Brunswick the following year to study pre-medicine at Mount Allison University. However, he quickly became interested in Fine Arts, especially painting. He was encouraged to paint by Lawren P. Harris and Alex Colville.

From 1957 to 1959, Pratt studied at the Glasgow School of Art in Scotland. During the summers, he returned to Newfoundland to work as a construction surveyor at the American Naval Base at Argentia. The training he received in precise measuring was applied to his paintings. In 1959 Pratt returned to Mount Allison University to complete in 1961 a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. During this period he began to make silkscreen prints. The early screen print &quot;Boat in Sand&quot;, 1961 in the National Gallery&#x27;s collection was produced at this time and included in the Gallery&#x27;s fourth Biennial Exhibition. The praise it received from the biennial jury launched Pratt&#x27;s career.

==Career==
Pratt&#x27;s subjects included landscapes, architecture, and occasionally figure work. 
I have a profound sense of the power of ordinariness, and of ordinary things ... I mean ordinary in the sense that this is a person, place or thing that has nothing going for it but the fact of its own existence, the fact that it &quot;is&quot;...

In making prints, Pratt worked from studies to the silkscreen, using abstracted collages.

In 1961, Pratt accepted the position of curator at the newly opened Memorial University Art Gallery in St. John&#x27;s. He remained at the gallery for two and a half years before deciding to concentrate on his painting full-time, moving his family to Salmonier, Newfoundland.

His work was the subject of a major touring retrospective organized by the Vancouver Art Gallery in 1985, a touring print retrospective and catalogue raisonné, &quot;The Prints of Christopher Pratt: 1958-1991&quot; in 1992, a major traveling retrospective exhibition organized by the National Gallery of Canada in 2005, and a ten-year retrospective of his work at The Rooms in 2015.

Pratt&#x27;s work was also exhibited extensively outside Canada. The Mira Godard Gallery, in association with the Marlborough Gallery, exhibited his work in New York in 1976. In 1982, Mira Godard Gallery and the Canada House Cultural Centre Gallery in London, England, organized a show of Pratt&#x27;s paintings, prints and drawings; the show toured Paris, Brussels and Dublin. A collection of Pratt&#x27;s silkscreen prints, created between 1960 and 1982, traveled to Rome, Glasgow, Berkshire, Dublin and Vienna (1983 - 1985) and, in 1986, several of Pratt&#x27;s prints were featured by the American Associated Artists Gallery in New York. Two years later, a number of Pratt&#x27;s paintings were exhibited at the 49th Parallel Gallery in New York.

Pratt served on the Canadian government&#x27;s Stamp Design Advisory Committee from 1972 to 1975 and on the board of the Canada Council for the Arts from 1975 to 1981. In 1980, at the request of the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, Pratt designed the Provincial Flag of Newfoundland and Labrador. His work is found in the public collections of the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Vancouver Art Gallery, The Rooms, and the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia.

==Personal life==
Pratt met artist Mary West at Mount Allison University. They married in 1957 and had five children: John, Anne, Barbara, Ned, and David, who died in infancy. The couple divorced in 2004. He later married Jeanette Meehan, who was his studio assistant, in 2007; they divorced in 2016.

Pratt lived and worked in the community of St. Catherine&#x27;s, in a region often referred to simply as Salmonier, Mount Carmel at the head of St. Mary&#x27;s Bay, from 1963 until his death. He died on the morning of June 5, 2022, at his home on the bank of the Salmonier River. He was 86 years old.

==Awards and honours==
Pratt became an associate of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts (ARCA) and a member of the Canadian Society of Graphic Art in 1965, at the age of 30. Eight years later, he was appointed an officer of the Order of Canada, before becoming a companion of the Order in 1983. He was awarded the Order of Newfoundland and Labrador in 2018.

Pratt was awarded an honorary doctorate by Memorial University of Newfoundland in 1972.

In 2018, Pratt was the subject of Kenneth J. Harvey&#x27;s documentary film &quot;Immaculate Memories: The Uncluttered Worlds of Christopher Pratt&quot;.

<text>Mary Frances Pratt, D.Litt (née West) (March 15, 1935 – August 14, 2018) was a Canadian painter known for photo-realist still life paintings. Pratt never thought of her work as being focused on one subject matter: her early work is often of domestic scenes, while later work may have a darker undertone, with people as the central subject matter. She painted what appealed to her, being emotionally connected to her subject. Pratt often spoke of conveying the sensuality of light in her paintings, and of the &quot;erotic charge&quot; her chosen subjects possessed.

==Career==

===Painting===
Mary Pratt&#x27;s work focused on her relationship with domestic life in rural Newfoundland and common household items: jars of jelly, apples, aluminum foil, brown paper bags. Using photographic projections while painting, Pratt&#x27;s style was bold and flamboyant, rendering her subject vivid and realistic. Due to this transformation of the mundane into something aesthetic, &quot;she may have had more influence on shaping the way we see things than any Canadian painter since the Group of Seven&quot;. Pratt arrived at her signature style in the late 1960s, after discovering that light was her central subject and deciding to incorporate photography into her artistic process. Her paintings &quot;The Bed&quot; (1968) and &quot;Supper Table&quot; (1969) are the earliest examples of her characteristic style.

In 1978 Pratt&#x27;s painting &quot;Girl in a Wicker Chair&quot;, created that year, was published on the cover of &quot;Saturday Night&quot; magazine. This was the first of an extended series of paintings on Donna Meaney, who first served as a model for Pratt&#x27;s artist husband, Christopher Pratt and with whom he reportedly had a brief affair. Some of Pratt&#x27;s paintings of Donna were based on her husband&#x27;s photographs. These works are markedly different from those composed and photographed by Pratt herself. Pratt&#x27;s portraits of Meaney embody a noticeable tension that is absent in her husband&#x27;s paintings of her. However, Pratt always regarded Meaney as a friend.

In the 1980s Pratt continued exploring new subject matter and media. She created a series of paintings on weddings, including a portrait of her daughter Barbara, entitled &quot;Barby in the Dress She Made Herself&quot; (1986). Another series consists of paintings and mixed-media drawings of fires, which function as a metaphor for sacrifice. Using pastels and coloured pencils in this series enabled Pratt to work on a larger scale than she had previously done in oils.

In the early 1990s Pratt and her husband separated, which lent her paintings of that period a darker, angry tone. For example, &quot;Pomegranates in Glass on Glass&quot; (1993) depicts the fruit torn apart into pieces, exposing its blood-red seeds.

In a 2013 &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; article, responding to critics of her work as too commercial, she said, &quot;People will find out that in each one of the paintings there is something that ought to disturb them, something upsetting. That is why I painted them.&quot;

===Exhibitions===

Pratt&#x27;s paintings have been exhibited in most major galleries in Canada, reproduced in magazines such as &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, &quot;Chatelaine&quot;, and &quot;Canadian Art&quot;. Her work is found in many prominent public, corporate, and private collections, including those of the National Gallery of Canada, The Rooms, Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, the New Brunswick Museum, Beaverbrook Art Gallery, Vancouver Art Gallery, Art Gallery of Ontario, and Canada House in England.

Pratt&#x27;s first solo exhibition was held at the Memorial University Art Gallery in St. John&#x27;s in 1967. The first showing of her art outside Atlantic Canada was part of an exhibition at the Picture Loan Gallery in 1971 in Toronto. In 1973, Erindale College (Toronto) gave her a show of her own.

The big breakthrough for wider notice of Pratt&#x27;s work came when the National Gallery of Canada included many of her paintings and drawing in an exhibition in 1975 titled &quot;Some Canadian Women Artists&quot; curated by Mayo Graham. Her work also coincided with the upsurge of the women&#x27;s movement (International Women&#x27;s Year was in 1975 as well). Several colleges and universities began incorporating discussions of her works in their women&#x27;s studies programs. Public galleries began to show Pratt&#x27;s work, holding retrospectives, among them Museum London (1981) and the Robert McLaughlin Gallery, Oshawa (1983).

In 1995, the touring exhibition &quot;The Art of Mary Pratt: The Substance of Light&quot; was organized by the Beaverbrook Art Gallery in Fredericton, New Brunswick. The accompanying catalogue won numerous awards and was included in &quot;Great Canadian Books of the Century&quot;. Other recent shows at commercial galleries include &quot;Inside Light&quot; at the Equinox Gallery in Vancouver, Canada (May/June 2011) and &quot;New Paintings and Works on Paper&quot; at the Mira Godard Gallery in Toronto, Canada (May/June 2012). The exhibition was curated by Tom Smart.

The solo exhibition titled &quot;Mary Pratt&quot; toured throughout Canada from 2013 to January, 2015. It was organized by The Rooms Provincial Art Gallery and Art Gallery of Nova Scotia and curated by Mireille Eagan, Sarah Fillmore, and Caroline Stone. The accompanying catalogue was published by Goose Lane Editions. The tour traveled to the Art Gallery of Windsor in Windsor, Ontario; the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario; the MacKenzie Art Gallery in Regina, Saskatchewan; and the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

The solo exhibition &quot;Mary Pratt: This Little Painting&quot; was on display at the National Gallery of Canada, running from April 4, 2015, to January 4, 2016. It toured to the Owens Art Gallery at Mount Allison University from March 11 to May 22, 2016. The exhibition was co-organized by the National Gallery of Canada and The Rooms Provincial Art Gallery. It was curated by Jonathan Shaughnessy and Mireille Eagan.

===Advisory/Public Duty===
Pratt served on the government Task Force for Education in Newfoundland in 1973, on the Fishery Industry Advisory Board from 1978 to 1979, and on the Board of Management of the Grace General Hospital in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland. She also served on the Federal Cultural Policy Review Committee, which produced the Applebaum-Hébert Report in 1981. Pratt chaired a committee to advise on the creation of the School of Fine Arts at Sir Wilfred Grenfell College in Corner Brook, Newfoundland in 1985. Pratt held numerous other positions, including a seat on the Canada Council from 1987 to 1993, and on the Board of Regents of Mount Allison University from 1983 to 1991.

In the 1980s, Pratt began giving addresses and published essays in periodicals such as &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; and Glass Gazette.

==Personal life==
Pratt was the daughter of attorney William J. West, who served as the Minister of Justice of New Brunswick from 1952 to 1958 and Katherine E. MacMurray. From as young as the age of 2, Pratt was intrigued by the relationship of light meeting a subject and started taking paint lessons by the age of 10. She had a younger sister, Barbara West Cross. She was strongly influenced by her maternal grandmother, Edna McMurray, who was the co-founder of the first IODE chapter in New Brunswick and served as its activist president for over 20 years.

Pratt attended Mount Allison University, studying Fine Arts under Alex Colville, Ted Pulford, and Lawren P. Harris. completing her degree in 1961. In her second year, she met the artist Christopher Pratt while they were both students there; they married on September 12, 1957. Immediately after, they moved to Scotland, where Christopher had been accepted to the Glasgow School of Art.

In 1963, they moved to Salmonier at the head of St. Mary&#x27;s Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador. In 1964 the Memorial University Art Gallery mounted an exhibition of her work. She and Christopher had five children: John, Anne, Barbara, Ned, and David, who died in infancy. They divorced in 2005. The following year she married American artist Jim Rosen; they divorced in 2015. Mary Pratt died at home in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, on August 14, 2018.

==Awards and honours==
In 1996, Pratt was named Companion of the Order of Canada. In 1997, she was awarded the $50,000 Molson Prize for visual artists from the Canada Council for the Arts. In 2013, she was made a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. Pratt was also awarded nine honorary degrees from various universities throughout Canada, including from Dalhousie University (1985), Memorial University (D.Litt.) (1986), and St. Thomas University (2000).

In 2006, Pratt was awarded the Long Haul Award presented at the EVA Awards ceremony, which recognizes her as an influential artist in Newfoundland visual culture.

In 2007, Canada Post issued stamps in its &quot;Art Canada&quot; series in honour of Mary Pratt. The $0.52 (domestic rate) stamp featured her &quot;Jelly Shelf&quot; (1999). The souvenir sheet included the $0.52 stamp, as well as a $1.55 (international rate) stamp with her &quot;Iceberg in the North Atlantic&quot; (1991).

== Quotes ==
&quot;It can&#x27;t just be a painting of something, it has to be a painting that is something. A painting has to acquire a life of its own.&quot;&quot;I am not inspired by a person, but rather my relationship with the visual world.&quot;&quot;When I get in front of the easel and begin to paint, I sometimes burst into tears because I am so happy to be here. I am so glad it is just me, the canvas, the paint, and this dear little brush.&quot;&quot;I have found life very emotional and difficult to stay even. And I think that perhaps that comes out in the paintings - certainly I would never paint anything that didn&#x27;t strike me emotionally, something that didn&#x27;t physically bother me.&quot;&quot;People will find out that in each one of the paintings there is something that ought to disturb them, something upsetting. That is why I painted them.&quot;

<doc id="337269" wikidata="Q2928438" url="?curid=337269" title="French post offices in China">
<text>The French post offices in China were among the post offices maintained by foreign powers in China from the mid-19th century until 1922. The first civilian French Post Office in Shanghai, China opened in 1862. Initially, the French government used ordinary French postage stamps e.g. Napoleon III, Laureated Empire, Ceres and Sage issues for these offices. These forerunner stamps can be shown to have been sold or used in China only by a postmark. Stamps used at Shanghai prior to 1894, for example, can only be identified by diamond-shaped cancel made of a type referred to (in French) as a &quot;losange à gros chiffres&quot; with the numbers &quot;5104&quot; in the center of the cancel or a Shanghai c.d.s. There are actually two types of &quot;5104&quot; obliterators differ by the shape of the &quot;4&quot;, one straight and the other curved.

==Operation==
Unlike the other foreign post offices in China, the French operated two distinct types of post offices in China. Offices of the first type, typically located in French concessions and mostly in northern China, were run directly by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The offices of the second type, also referred to as the &quot;Indochinese Offices&quot; were located in southern China and operated under the direction of the postal administration of the nearby colony of French Indochina.

===Run by France===
The Paris-run Post Offices in China and their opening dates are as follows:

1862 
* Shanghai (spelled as &quot;Shang-haï&quot; in the French postmark of the period)

1889
* Tianjin (Tien-tsin)

1898
* Hankou (Han-kéou) 
* Zhifu (Tché-fou)

1900
* Arsenal Pagoda 
* Beijing (Pékin)
* Fuzhou (Fou-Tchéou)
* Ningbo (Ning-po)

1902
* Xiamen (Amoy)

For the above post offices, the French government issued stamps of the &quot;Peace and Commerce&quot; series overprinted with the word &quot;CHINE&quot; beginning in 1894. Stamp issues of the 20th century initially included overprints applied to some of the stamps issued for use in French Indochina, and continued with stamps printed specifically for use in China. Some earlier 20th century stamps were issued only with face values expressed in French francs, but all later issues were overprinted with the equivalent of the stamp’s Chinese currency face value expressed in both French and Chinese. 
In addition to ordinary postage stamps, France also issued postal stationery and postage due stamps for use at the Paris-run Chinese post offices.

===Run by French Indochina===

The post offices run by French Indochina differed from the other French Post Offices in China in a number of areas. Initially, the general issues of the Paris-run French Offices in China c. 1902–1904 were used, and these can be found with postmarks applied by the Indochinese offices. But shortly thereafter, stamps were issued with overprints specific to the office that issued them. For instance, the Canton office issued stamps overprinted &quot;CANTON&quot; rather than &quot;CHINE&quot;. Seven such Indochinese post offices had these overprints (here written as they appeared on the stamps) along with their opening dates:

1900
* Hoi Hao 
* Kouang Tchéou Wan 
* Yunnan Fou

1901
* Canton

1902
* Pakhoi
* Mongtze

1903
* Tchongking

One additional way that the Indochinese offices differed from the other French Post Offices in China was that their issues were all overprints applied to the then-current stamps of French Indochina, rather than to the stamps of France. The Paris-run offices would not accept mail franked with unoverprinted stamps of French Indochina, but the Indochinese run-offices are known to have done so. For this reason, French Indochina stamps are sometimes found legitimately used with cancels from one of their Chinese offices. Stamps from the Indochinese offices in China can likewise be found with cancels from Indochina proper, although these were likely applied at Hanoi or other locations through which mail had to pass, (i.e. these are essentially paquebot cancels.) From 1923, remainder stocks of the Indochinese office issues were used up in Indochina and Kouang Tchéou Wan, see below. 

The Indochinese Offices in France also sometimes opened sub-post offices within the area they served. For instance, the Canton office would eventually open six branches within the area it served. The specific branch a Canton stamp was used at can sometimes be seen in the postmark. Earlier Canton postmarks read &quot;Canton / Chine&quot; whereas later cancels include a code letter from A to F to show at which branch of the Canton office they were used. Although covers are uncommon to scarce with some index letters (code letter C being most common), on adhesives these cancels are quite common on the overprinted Indochina issues. Recently it has been suggested that these code letters could be time code instead of name of branch offices. Time coding was used by the British post office in Canton on its cancels at around this time. Code A was used in the morning shift and code B in the afternoon shift.

==Closure==
All foreign-run post offices in China permanently closed on 31 December 1922 if they had not been closed earlier.
- The remainder stocks of the Indochinese office issues were called back by the French Indochina postal authorities and used up in Indochina and Kouang Tchéou Wan. They are seen on commercially used covers, also used in mixed frank with regular issues, until the mid 1930s. Particular the stocks of high denomination stamps took a long time to be exhausted.

==Kwangchowan==
One notable exception to this were the post offices in Kouang Tchéou Wan (usually written in English as &quot;Kwangchowan&quot;) which was a territory leased by treaty to France for a 99-year period starting in 1898. This was an arrangement essentially similar to that covering Hong Kong’s &quot;New Territories&quot; from 1898 to 1997.

Due to its status as a leased territory still in existence after 1922, Kouang Tchéou was the only French postal entity in China to issue airmail stamps and semi-postal stamps, although most of these were issued by the government of Vichy France. Due to war-time conditions and to the fact that the colonial authorities in Kouang Tchéou did not recognize the Vichy government, Vichy-issued stamps for Kouang Tchéou were never placed in use there.

French postal operations in Kouang-Tchéou continued until 1943, when the colony was occupied by the Japanese army. Although France resumed sovereignty briefly over the colony for a few months at the end of the Second World War the territory was returned to China in early 1946.

<doc id="337279" wikidata="Q1638091" url="?curid=337279" title="Self-ionization of water">
<text>The self-ionization of water (also autoionization of water, autoprotolysis of water, autodissociation of water, or simply dissociation of water) is an ionization reaction in pure water or in an aqueous solution, in which a water molecule, H2O, deprotonates (loses the nucleus of one of its hydrogen atoms) to become a hydroxide ion, OH−. The hydrogen nucleus, H+, immediately protonates another water molecule to form a hydronium cation, H3O+. It is an example of autoprotolysis, and exemplifies the amphoteric nature of water.

==History and notation==
The self-ionization of water was first proposed in 1884 by Svante Arrhenius as part of the theory of ionic dissociation which he proposed to explain the conductivity of electrolytes including water. Arrhenius wrote the self-ionization as &lt;chem&gt;H2O &lt;=&gt; H+ + OH-&lt;/chem&gt;. At that time, nothing was yet known of atomic structure or subatomic particles, so he had no reason to consider the formation of an &lt;chem&gt;H+&lt;/chem&gt; ion from a hydrogen atom on electrolysis as any less likely than, say, the formation of a &lt;chem&gt;Na+&lt;/chem&gt; ion from a sodium atom.

In 1923 Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted and Martin Lowry proposed that the self-ionization of water actually involves two water molecules: &lt;chem&gt;H2O + H2O &lt;=&gt; H3O+ + OH-&lt;/chem&gt;. By this time the electron and the nucleus had been discovered and Rutherford had shown that a nucleus is very much smaller than an atom. This would include a bare ion &lt;chem&gt;H+&lt;/chem&gt; which would correspond to a proton with zero electrons. Brønsted and Lowry proposed that this ion does not exist free in solution, but always attaches itself to a water (or other solvent) molecule to form the hydronium ion &lt;chem&gt;H3O+&lt;/chem&gt; (or other protonated solvent).

Later spectroscopic evidence has shown that many protons are actually hydrated by more than one water molecule. The most descriptive notation for the hydrated ion is &lt;chem&gt;H+(aq)&lt;/chem&gt;, where aq (for aqueous) indicates an indefinite or variable number of water molecules. However the notations &lt;chem&gt;H+&lt;/chem&gt; and &lt;chem&gt;H3O+&lt;/chem&gt; are still also used extensively because of their historical importance. This article mostly represents the hydrated proton as &lt;chem&gt;H3O+&lt;/chem&gt;, corresponding to hydration by a single water molecule.

==Equilibrium constant==

Chemically pure water has an electrical conductivity of 0.055 μS/cm. According to the theories of Svante Arrhenius, this must be due to the presence of ions. The ions are produced by the water self-ionization reaction, which applies to pure water and any aqueous solution:

: H2O + H2O H3O+ + OH−

Expressed with chemical activities , instead of concentrations, the thermodynamic equilibrium constant for the water ionization reaction is:
:formula_1

which is numerically equal to the more traditional thermodynamic equilibrium constant written as:
:formula_2

under the assumption that the sum of the chemical potentials of H+ and H3O+ is formally equal to twice the chemical potential of H2O at the same temperature and pressure.

Because most acid–base solutions are typically very dilute, the activity of water is generally approximated as being equal to unity, which allows the ionic product of water to be expressed as:
:formula_3

In dilute aqueous solutions, the activities of solutes (dissolved species such as ions) are approximately equal to their concentrations. Thus, the &quot;ionization constant&quot;, &quot;dissociation constant&quot;, &quot;self-ionization constant&quot;, &quot;water ion-product constant&quot; or &quot;ionic product&quot; of water, symbolized by &quot;K&quot;w, may be given by:
:formula_4
where [H3O+] is the molarity (molar concentration) of hydrogen cation or hydronium ion, and [OH−] is the concentration of hydroxide ion. When the equilibrium constant is written as a product of concentrations (as opposed to activities) it is necessary to make corrections to the value of formula_5 depending on ionic strength and other factors (see below).

At 24.87 °C and zero ionic strength, &quot;K&quot;w is equal to . Note that as with all equilibrium constants, the result is dimensionless because the concentration is in fact a concentration relative to the standard state, which for H+ and OH− are both defined to be 1 molal (= 1 mol/kg) when molality is used or 1 molar (= 1 mol/L) when molar concentration is used. For many practical purposes, the molality (mol solute/kg water) and molar (mol solute/L solution) concentrations can be considered as nearly equal at ambient temperature and pressure if the solution density remains close to one (&quot;i.e.&quot;, sufficiently diluted solutions and negligible effect of temperature changes). The main advantage of the molal concentration unit (mol/kg water) is to result in stable and robust concentration values which are independent of the solution density and volume changes (density depending on the water salinity (ionic strength), temperature and pressure); therefore, molality is the preferred unit used in thermodynamic calculations or in precise or less-usual conditions, e.g., for seawater with a density significantly different from that of pure water, or at elevated temperatures, like those prevailing in thermal power plants.

We can also define p&quot;K&quot;w formula_6 −log10 &quot;K&quot;w (which is approximately 14 at 25 °C). This is analogous to the notations pH and p&quot;K&quot;a for an acid dissociation constant, where the symbol p denotes a cologarithm. The logarithmic form of the equilibrium constant equation is p&quot;K&quot;w = pH + pOH.

==Dependence on temperature, pressure and ionic strength==

The dependence of the water ionization on temperature and pressure has been investigated thoroughly. The value of p&quot;K&quot;w decreases as temperature increases from the melting point of ice to a minimum at c. 250 °C, after which it increases up to the critical point of water c. 374 °C. It decreases with increasing pressure

With electrolyte solutions, the value of p&quot;K&quot;w is dependent on ionic strength of the electrolyte. Values for sodium chloride are typical for a 1:1 electrolyte. With 1:2 electrolytes, MX2, p&quot;K&quot;w decreases with increasing ionic strength.

The value of &quot;K&quot;w is usually of interest in the liquid phase. Example values for superheated steam (gas) and supercritical water fluid are given in the table.
:&quot;Notes to the table. The values are for supercritical fluid except those marked: a at saturation pressure corresponding to 350 °C. b superheated steam. c compressed or subcooled liquid.&quot;

==Isotope effects==
Heavy water, D2O, self-ionizes less than normal water, H2O;
:D2O + D2O D3O+ + OD−

This is due to the equilibrium isotope effect, a quantum mechanical effect attributed to oxygen forming a slightly stronger bond to deuterium because the larger mass of deuterium results in a lower zero-point energy.

Expressed with activities &quot;a&quot;, instead of concentrations, the thermodynamic equilibrium constant for the heavy water ionization reaction is:
:formula_7

Assuming the activity of the D2O to be 1, and assuming that the activities of the D3O+ and OD− are closely approximated by their concentrations
:formula_8
The following table compares the values of p&quot;K&quot;w for H2O and D2O.

===Ionization equilibria in water–heavy water mixtures===
In water–heavy water mixtures equilibria several species are involved: H2O, HDO, D2O, H3O+, D3O+, H2DO+, HD2O+, HO−, DO−.

==Mechanism==
The rate of reaction for the ionization reaction
:2 H2O → H3O+ + OH−
depends on the activation energy, Δ&quot;E&quot;‡. According to the Boltzmann distribution the proportion of water molecules that have sufficient energy, due to thermal population, is given by

:formula_9
where &quot;k&quot; is the Boltzmann constant. Thus some dissociation can occur because sufficient thermal energy is available. The following sequence of events has been proposed on the basis of electric field fluctuations in liquid water. Random fluctuations in molecular motions occasionally (about once every 10 hours per water molecule) produce an electric field strong enough to break an oxygen–hydrogen bond, resulting in a hydroxide (OH−) and hydronium ion (H3O+); the hydrogen nucleus of the hydronium ion travels along water molecules by the Grotthuss mechanism and a change in the hydrogen bond network in the solvent isolates the two ions, which are stabilized by solvation. Within 1 picosecond, however, a second reorganization of the hydrogen bond network allows rapid proton transfer down the electric potential difference and subsequent recombination of the ions. This timescale is consistent with the time it takes for hydrogen bonds to reorientate themselves in water.

The inverse recombination reaction
:H3O+ + OH− → 2 H2O
is among the fastest chemical reactions known, with a reaction rate constant of at room temperature. Such a rapid rate is characteristic of a diffusion-controlled reaction, in which the rate is limited by the speed of molecular diffusion.

==Relationship with the neutral point of water==
Water molecules dissociate into equal amounts of H3O+ and OH−, so their concentrations are almost exactly at 25 °C and 0.1 MPa. A solution in which the H3O+ and OH− concentrations equal each other is considered a neutral solution. In general, the pH of the neutral point is numerically equal to p&quot;K&quot;w.

Pure water is neutral, but most water samples contain impurities. If an impurity is an acid or base, this will affect the concentrations of hydronium ion and hydroxide ion. Water samples that are exposed to air will absorb some carbon dioxide to form carbonic acid (H2CO3) and the concentration of H3O+ will increase due to the reaction H2CO3 + H2O = HCO3− + H3O+. The concentration of OH− will decrease in such a way that the product [H3O+][OH−] remains constant for fixed temperature and pressure. Thus these water samples will be slightly acidic. If a pH of exactly 7.0 is required, it must be maintained with an appropriate buffer solution.

<text>Nathaniel Rochester (February 21, 1752 – May 17, 1831) was an American Revolutionary War soldier and land speculator, most noted for founding the settlement which would become Rochester, New York.

==Early life==
Nathaniel Rochester was the fifth of six children born to John and Hester Thrift Rochester in Westmoreland County, Virginia on February 21, 1752. His father, who owned Rochester House, died in 1756. Five years later, Hester married Thomas Cricher. Cricher moved the family to Granville County, North Carolina in 1763, where Nathaniel attended the school of the Reverend Henry Pattillo. His grandfather William Rochester emigrated from England to the Americas.

At age 16, Rochester found a job with a local Hillsborough merchant, signing a two-year contract to be paid £5 per year, which after six months was revised to pay him £20 per year. Rochester would eventually become a partner in the business within five years. In his early working years, he also served as a clerk for the vestry of St. Matthew&#x27;s Parish, as a committee member for a civic organization, and, most notably, as a delegate to North Carolina&#x27;s first Provincial Congress.

==Career==
===Military, politics, and business===
In 1775, as the Revolution approached, Rochester was named to the Committee of Safety for Orange County. According to Rochester, his duties necessitated him to &quot;promote revolutionary spirit among the people, provide arms and ammunition, make collections for the people of Boston, and prevent the sale of East India teas.&quot; On August 20 of that year, he attended the Third Provincial Congress as a representative of Hillsborough. Rochester was appointed a major in the North Carolina militia, and served as justice of the peace and paymaster of the battalion of minutemen in the district of Hillsborough. The following year, he was assigned command of two infantry and one cavalry company. He was tasked with following Colonel James Thackston in pursuit of Tories marching to join the British at Wilmington. En route, his force captured five hundred Tories retreating from the Battle of Moore&#x27;s Creek Bridge.

In 1776, Rochester represented Orange County in the Fourth Provincial Congress and was elevated to the rank of colonel in the North Carolina Line. Due to illness, however, Rochester was rendered unfit for military duty and had to resign his command. His role in politics was not affected, and in 1777 he was elected to the North Carolina General Assembly, where he served as county clerk. In addition, Rochester was appointed Colonel of the North Carolina militia. Rochester was also made commissioner in charge of building and managing an arms factory and courthouse, and assisted in establishing an academy in the Hillsborough area.

In 1778 Rochester resigned and entered a mercantile venture with Colonel Thomas Hart, a notable and wealthy merchant and land speculator, and James Brown. Rochester began to invest his earnings into real estate, a practice he continued throughout his life. With the British Army&#x27;s imminent occupation of Hillsborough, Rochester moved to Philadelphia where he was almost immediately stricken with smallpox. After a lengthy recovery, he joined Hart in Hagerstown, Maryland, where the two became partners in a flour mill, a nail and rope factory, a bank, and a farm.

Rochester remained in Maryland for thirty years, where he served one term in the Maryland General Assembly and two years as postmaster. He was elected as a judge in 1797 but resigned, recognizing that he did not have the proper legal training. Rochester served as Washington County&#x27;s Sheriff from 1804 to 1806, a presidential elector, and vestryman of Saint John&#x27;s Church. In 1807, Rochester helped found the Hagerstown Bank, serving as its first president.

===Land speculation===

Two of the directors of the Hagerstown Bank, Colonel William Fitzhugh and Major Charles Carroll were, like Rochester, wealthy landowners interested in acquiring land in the new &quot;frontier&quot; of the U.S. In 1800, Fitzhugh and Carroll convinced Rochester to travel with them on a prospecting visit to the frontier lands of New York, specifically to the lands along the Genesee River. Their first trip took them to Dansville, where Rochester purchased a combined 520 acres, while Fitzhugh and Carroll purchased another 12,000 at $2 per acre.

In November 1803, the three men returned to Geneva to make payments. They were convinced by the land agent to visit the Genesee Falls further north, where they found an abandoned grist and saw mill—opened in 1789—once owned by Ebenezer “Indian” Allen. The men recognized a business opportunity as products traveling upriver toward Lake Ontario would need to be unloaded at the saw mill, and portage fees could be charged. On November 8, 1803, the three men signed a purchase agreement for a tract near the river&#x27;s Upper Falls. The final payment of $1,750 (~$ in ) was made on June 22, 1808.

===Life on the Genesee===
Rochester&#x27;s interest in the land he now owned along the Genesee prompted him to relocate his family to the river valley in May 1810. On June 10 of that year, the family reached Dansville and established a homestead.

Upon his arrival, Rochester quickly became a leading citizen of Dansville, establishing numerous businesses and mills and playing an active role in the early politics of the town. He offered to sell his share of the Upper Falls tract to Major Carroll, though Carroll convinced him to keep his interest. In January 1814, Rochester sold his property and holdings in Dansville—a grist mill, sawmill, 700 acres of land, interest in a wool carding shop, and the first paper mill in Western New York—for $24,000 (~$ in ) and moved to East Bloomfield in Ontario County.

===Rochesterville===

In 1811, Rochester began establishing a town on the Upper Falls tract. He laid out streets on a gridiron pattern and established plots of land for municipal, church, and business use. Later that year, he began to offer quarter-acre lots for sale on the two main roads—Buffalo Street running east to west and leading to a bridge across the river, and Mill Street running north to south. Lots were sold for $50, except for the northwest lot at Four Corners which sold for $200; lots on adjoining streets were sold for $30 and buyers were required to pay a $5 deposit and build a home or business twenty-by-sixteen feet within one year. Rochester reserved a large lot on Buffalo Street for public buildings. While the settlement had previously been called The Falls or Falls Town, the three partners agreed to the name &quot;Rochesterville.&quot; When later accused of vanity for the name Rochester quipped, &quot;Should I call [the village] Fitzhugh or Carroll, the slighted gentleman would certainly feel offended with the other; but if I called it by my name, they would most likely be angry with me; so, it is best to call it Rochester and serve both alike.&quot;

On May 1, 1812, the first settler Hamlet Scrantom arrived with his family. Work on their cabin at Four Corners was not yet finished, so the family stayed with Rochester&#x27;s land agent Enos Stone, who had been living in Allen&#x27;s former mill on the east side of the river, until its completion on July 4, 1812. Next came Jehiel Barnard, arriving on September 1 and erecting the settlement&#x27;s first tailor shop, which would also become its first meeting house and church. Other initial settlers included Abelard Reynolds, who established a pioneer saddlery and the village&#x27;s first post office, Silas O. Smith; Elisha and Hervey Eli; and Josiah Bissel, Jr. In 1814, it&#x27;s believed that Reynolds&#x27; son, Mortimer, was the first white child born in Rochester;

The War of 1812 helped Rochesterville grow as settlers living in Charlotte and other settlements along the shore of Lake Ontario sought to move farther inland. Furthermore, numerous skirmishes and war activities were taking place throughout western New York, and Rochesterville served as a waypoint and depot for military supplies. The exposure proved advantageous for the settlement, as many people who had traveled through purchased lots or tracts in or near the village. One lot, which sold for $200 in 1811, would eventually sell for $11,200 in January 1817.

In 1817, Rochester served on a committee to petition the state to build what would become the Erie Canal on a proposed northern route that included a crossing on the Genesee River at Rochesterville. The government eventually accepted this route, contributing to the growth of the future city. In late 1817, Rochester helped petition the state to incorporate Rochesterville. Although the first petition failed due to opposition from neighboring jurisdictions, a second petition passed, and the City of Rochester was incorporated on 21 April. The suffix -ville was dropped in 1822. Also in 1817, Rochester was part of a group that organized St. Luke&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Genesee Falls, with Rochester serving as its first Senior Warden. Eventually, Rochester gave land for the church building on Fitzhugh Street.

In 1821 Rochester played a pivotal role in the creation of Monroe County, which Rochester named after President James Monroe. When the county was officially formed, Rochester became its first county clerk and was elected its first representative to the New York State Assembly.

==Later years==
Rochester remained an active participant in the growth of the town and county he founded, playing many roles in developing its economy and status. He played an active role in politics, helped found churches and banks, and served as the first president of the Rochester Athenænum, which would later become Rochester Institute of Technology.

During the last two years of his life, Rochester made few public appearances but spent most of his time with his now rather large family, including his 28 grandchildren. Rochester died on May 17, 1831, suffering from a protracted and painful illness. He was interred at Mount Hope Cemetery in Rochester.

==Personal life==
In 1788, Rochester married Sophia Beatty (1768–1845) in Hagerstown, Maryland. Together they had twelve children, among them Judge and Congressman William B. Rochester and Mayor Thomas H. Rochester.

===Legacy===
The Rochester Institute of Technology had a dormitory named Nathaniel Rochester Hall, the third tallest of the campus&#x27; four dormitory towers. This dormitory was later renamed Fredericka Douglass Sprague Perry Hall. This change was made due to Nathaniel Rochester&#x27;s involvement with the slave trade. Nathaniel Square Park, at the intersection of South Avenue and Alexander Street in the South Wedge neighborhood, is home to a statue of Nathaniel Rochester sitting on a bench, sculpted by Pepsy Kettavong. There is also a school in the city of Rochester named Nathaniel Rochester Community School (School No. 3).

===Slavery===
A 1790 account book, purchased from Rochester&#x27;s descendants by the University of Rochester&#x27;s Rush Rhees Library, uncovered Nathaniel Rochester&#x27;s involvement in the slave trade. The ledger shows the purchase and subsequent sale of human beings by Rochester and his partners in that year, though it is unknown to what extent he participated in the slave trade in other years.

When Rochester, Fitzhugh, and Carroll made their initial journey to the Genesee Country in September 1800, there were accompanied by at least one enslaved person. When Rochester moved from Hagerstown to Dansville in 1810, he brought about half a dozen enslaved people with him.

According to an 1811 document, Rochester did free two of his slaves. A document of manumission states: &quot;... by those present doth manumit and make free from slavery my Negro Slave named Benjamin about sixteen years old and my Negro Slave Casandra about fourteen years old.&quot; Another document shows that, on the same day, another enslaved person, Casandra, was made an indentured servant who would learn to read and write and &quot;the art and mystery of a Cook...until the said apprentice shall accomplish her full age of eighteen years.&quot;

In the late 1810s, Rochester contemplated moving to Missouri because of New York&#x27;s gradual abolition laws. According to Rochester, &quot;Were slavery tolerated in New York, I would never go in quest of finer soil; the absence of this necessary evil, to a person of southern habits, is an insuperable objection to the country. I could brook the climate; could I have my negroes to work for me.” Ultimately, Rochester remained in New York because the move to Missouri seemed too daunting at his advanced age.

<doc id="337295" wikidata="Q4355525" url="?curid=337295" title="Elfwood">
<text>Elfwood was a web-based alternative art gallery and online community devoted to original science fiction and fantasy art and writing. It was started 1 May 1996 by Thomas Abrahamsson and claimed to be the largest science fiction and fantasy art site in the world. It was most popular in the Americas and Europe. Gradually overwhelmed by its competitor DeviantArt, Elfwood was eventually shut down in 2016.

==History==

===Early years===
Elfwood was founded on May 1, 1996, by Thomas Abrahamsson, heavily inspired by Massimilianno Bertuzzi and Robert Orta, under the name of the &quot;Lothlorien&quot; project, and was aimed at amateur high-fantasy artists. The site was hosted as a non-profit maintained by the academic computer club Lysator of Linköping University in Sweden, and run on the Roxen Software. At the time, its gallery consisted of three artists (including Abrahamsson), and all submissions and updates to the site were managed directly by Abrahamsson, with the individual users e-mailing Abrahamsson with their requested submissions or changes.

Abrahamsson stated his original intentions with the website could be described as the following: &quot;There are three major ideas behind this site: Showing pieces of art from the wonderful world of fantasy to the general public, letting all amateur fantasy artists show their work for free, helping them to get a name and reputation, and helping other artists with inspiration by giving a chance to look at fellow artists&#x27; art.&quot;As the Lothlorien membership and gallery expanded, Abrahamsson developed the site&#x27;s extranet in August 1997, allowing Elfwood members to manage their own individual art galleries and account information directly, without requiring webmaster assistance.

After a while, &quot;Zone 47&quot; was created for science fiction and modern fantasy art, and two years later the &quot;Wyvern&#x27;s Library&quot; was created for written science fiction and fantasy submissions. This expanded to include how-to guides and full range motifs. A few months later, FARP (Fantasy Art Resource Project) was created and their email list, WoodChat was designed.

In April 2000 the ERB (Elfwood Review Board) was founded. It was responsible for maintaining the rules on Elfwood.

=== Moderation ===
Originally, Elfwood was moderated by a small group of five, which included Thomas F. Abrahmsson as the founder, Mirar, as a software maintenance technician, Henrik &#x27;Hedda&#x27; Wallin as the systems engineer, Eliza M. Leahy as a recruitment co-ordinator for West Coast America, and Peter &#x27;ZinO&#x27; Bortas as an applications administrator and moderator, along with the Elfwood Review Board. 

By Early 2003, their team had grown, adding in Eline &#x27;Ellende&#x27; Spek, who became a moderation training assistant and media manager, as well as a core group of volunteer moderators.

===Temporary closing===
In June 2001, Elfwood was closed due to death threats after a man with the alias &quot;Assassin&quot; threatened to throw gasoline on the ERB crew and burn them alive. The site reopened a month later. In July the FanQuarter area was opened. At the end of 2001 changes to Elfwood were put on hold so a more manageable system could be created. Elfwood was reopened in February 2002 with a new moderating system. 

In January 2004 the sections known as Zone 47 and Lothlorien merged to create the current SF&amp;F Art area. Along with the change came a new layout for the whole site, as well as revisions to the rules. In November of that year, Elfwood artist Paul Cameron Bennett was charged in League City, Texas for kidnapping a 14-year-old girl, Margaret “Katy” Catherine Wilkerson, whom he met through a chat-room linked through Elfwood.

Elfwood had a major crash, dubbed &quot;the infamous April Fool&#x27;s Day Elfwood crash,&quot; on the first of April in 2005. All data was lost and the last backup was from February. The site came back with a timewarp to February and the rules were again revised and rewritten. Archived copies of the Elfwood statistics counter from the Wayback Machine show 8000 fewer images and 200 fewer stories between the 1st and 10 April 2005.

===Commercialization and afterwards===
After 11 years as an amateur website, Elfwood was transformed into a commercial community in September 2007, adding new features for creating user profiles also for visiting users, tagging of favorite members and works and much more. Founder Thomas Abrahamsson said, &quot;Cost for hosting and servers had become too high to handle as a hobby project.&quot; With this came the move of the servers from Linköping University. Before the move, Abrahamsson was frequently physically unable to access the servers to maintain the site due to their former location at the university grounds, which were locked down during the holidays.

In May 2009, Elfwood launched a completely revised set of simplified rules, accepting a much wider range of works and even out-of-genre items under a special &#x27;Other Works&#x27; tab. The Extranet was taken down its functions fully transferred to the main site, replaced by a more user friendly upload interface and simpler moderation process.

Later on Elfwood&#x27;s first Art Collaboration Club was born called &quot;Bitfrost Fantasy&quot;, founded by Paula Fletcher. The name Bifrost was taken from Norse Mythology, being the sparkling rainbow bridge that connects Aesgard (land of the gods) and Midgard (land of mortals). Bifrost&#x27;s goal was to &quot;build a bridge&quot; between fantasy artists and writers, from all over the world, in a creative and friendly atmosphere. 

==Site content==
Each piece was reviewed by moderators before being displayed in a gallery, and profanity and provocative language were not allowed. As of August 31, 2005 the rules were simplified, and in May 2009 they were further streamlined allowing also Non-Genre contents under a new &quot;Other Works&quot; tab. Members had to be 13 years or older to join with a real name. 
===Artistic Display Areas===
Elfwood had three main display areas for creative work:

* SciFi &amp; Fantasy Art is the main section (it was formerly divided in two sections, &quot;Lothlorien&quot; for high fantasy art and &quot;Zone 47&quot; for science fiction and modern/futuristic fantasy art).
* Wyvern&#x27;s Library is for sci-fi and fantasy themed stories and poetry, including short stories as well as longer novels broken up by chapters.
* FanQuarter is devoted to fan art based on sci-fi or fantasy themed visual media such as video games, movies, animated cartoons or TV shows.

As of August 16, 2010, there were 941 separate galleries in SciFi &amp; Fantasy Art and 148 galleries in FanQuarter.

====&quot;Woodworks&quot;====
The Elfwood ezine &quot;Woodworks&quot; was started in January 2002 by Georgette Tan, which featured articles, reviews, artwork and tutorials by Elfwood members. Tan later retired as Editor and Megan Larson took the position, leading Woodworks to its final issue in December 2004. It is now hosted in an inactive state at the main Elfwood site after the domain was finally shut down in late 2006.

==Statistics==
In 2003, Elfwood had 6700 artists and 1300 writers. It logged 14500 sessions per day, each averaging 35 minutes in length. Sixty percent of the users were in the USA and most of the rest in Canada and Europe.

==Reception==
Elfwood had been praised as an outlet for alternative beliefs. The community had been described as a &quot;very interactive place where people are very supportive,&quot; in a quote from the &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot;.

The FARP section of the site had been frequently recommended as a free resource for tutorials in a wide variety of creative topics. For example, TeachEngineering.org cited two of FARP&#x27;s tutorials as &quot;excellent guides&quot; for figure drawing and writing about action, &quot;Figure Drawing: Basic Pose and Construction&quot; by William Li and &quot;Writing Action&quot; by S. B. &quot;Kinko&quot; Hulsey.

<doc id="337301" wikidata="Q1431014" url="?curid=337301" title="National Ignition Facility">
<text>The National Ignition Facility (NIF) is a laser-based inertial confinement fusion (ICF) research device, located at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, California, United States. NIF&#x27;s mission is to achieve fusion ignition with high energy gain. It achieved the first instance of scientific breakeven controlled fusion in an experiment on December 5, 2022, with an energy gain factor of 1.5. It supports nuclear weapon maintenance and design by studying the behavior of matter under the conditions found within nuclear explosions.

NIF is the largest and most powerful ICF device built to date. The basic ICF concept is to squeeze a small amount of fuel to reach the pressure and temperature necessary for fusion. NIF hosts the world&#x27;s most energetic laser, which indirectly heats the outer layer of a small sphere. The energy is so intense that it causes the sphere to implode, squeezing the fuel inside. The implosion reaches a peak speed of , raising the fuel density from about that of water to about 100 times that of lead. The delivery of energy and the adiabatic process during implosion raises the temperature of the fuel to hundreds of millions of degrees. At these temperatures, fusion processes occur in the tiny interval before the fuel explodes outward.

Construction on the NIF began in 1997. NIF was completed five years behind schedule and cost almost four times its original budget. Construction was certified complete on March 31, 2009, by the U.S. Department of Energy. The first large-scale experiments were performed in June 2009 and the first &quot;integrated ignition experiments&quot; (which tested the laser&#x27;s power) were declared completed in October 2010.

From 2009 to 2012 experiments were conducted under the National Ignition Campaign, with the goal of reaching ignition just after the laser reached full power, some time in the second half of 2012. The campaign officially ended in September 2012, at about the conditions needed for ignition. Thereafter NIF has been used primarily for materials science and weapons research. In 2021, after improvements in fuel target design, NIF produced 70% of the energy of the laser, beating the record set in 1997 by the JET reactor at 67% and achieving a burning plasma. On December 5, 2022, after further technical improvements, NIF reached &quot;ignition&quot;, or scientific breakeven, for the first time, achieving a 154% energy yield compared to the input energy. However, while this was scientifically a success, the experiment in practice produced less than 1% of the energy the facility used to create it: while 3.15 MJ of energy was yielded from 2.05 MJ input, the lasers delivering the 2.05 MJ of energy took about 300 MJ to produce in the facility.

== Inertial confinement fusion basics ==

Inertial confinement fusion (ICF) devices use intense energy to rapidly heat the outer layers of a target in order to compress it. Nuclear fission provides the energy source for thermonuclear warheads, while sources such as laser beams and particle beams are used in non-weapon devices.

The target is a small spherical pellet containing a few milligrams of fusion fuel, typically a mix of deuterium (D) and tritium (T), as this composition has the lowest ignition temperature.

The lasers can either heat the surface of the fuel pellet directly – known as &quot;direct drive&quot; – or heat the inner surface of a hollow metal cylinder around the pellet – known as &quot;indirect drive&quot;. In the indirect drive case, the cylinder, called a &quot;hohlraum&quot; (German for &#x27;hollow room&#x27; or &#x27;cavity&#x27;), becomes hot enough to re-emit the energy as even higher frequency X-rays. These X-rays, which are more symmetrically distributed than the original laser light, heat the surface of pellet. 

In either case, the material on the outside of the pellet is turned into a plasma, which explodes away from the surface. The rest of the pellet is driven inward on all sides, into a small volume of extremely high density. The surface explosion creates shock waves that travel inward. At the center of the fuel, a small volume is further heated and compressed. When the temperature and density are high enough, fusion reactions occur. The energy must be delivered quickly and spread extremely evenly across the target&#x27;s outer surface in order to compress the fuel symmetrically.

The reactions release high-energy particles, some of which, primarily alpha particles, collide with unfused fuel and heat it further, potentially triggering additional fusion. At the same time, the fuel is also losing heat through x-ray losses and hot electrons leaving the fuel area. Thus the rate of alpha heating must be greater than the loss rate, termed &quot;bootstrapping&quot;. Given the right conditions—high enough density, temperature, and duration—bootstrapping results in a chain reaction, burning outward from the center. This is known as &quot;ignition&quot;, which fuses a significant portion of the fuel and releases large amounts of energy.

As of 1998, most ICF experiments had used laser drivers. Other drivers have been examined, such as heavy ions driven by particle accelerators.

== Design ==

=== System ===
NIF primarily uses the indirect drive method of operation, in which the laser heats a small metal cylinder surrounding the capsule inside it, which then emits X-rays that heat the fuel pellet. Experimental systems, including the OMEGA and Nova lasers, validated this approach. The NIF&#x27;s high power supports a much larger target than OMEGA or Nova; the baseline pellet design is about 2 mm in diameter. It is chilled to about 18 kelvin (−255 °C) and lined with a layer of frozen deuterium–tritium (DT) fuel. The hollow interior contains a small amount of DT gas.

In a typical experiment, the laser generates 3 MJ of infrared laser energy of a possible 4. About 1.5 MJ remains after conversion to UV, and another 15 percent is lost in the hohlraum. About 15 percent of the resulting x-rays, about 150 kJ, are absorbed by the target&#x27;s outer layers. The coupling between the capsule and the x-rays is lossy, and ultimately only about 10 to 14 kJ of energy is deposited in the fuel.

The fuels in the center of the target are compressed to a density of about 1000 g/cm3. For comparison, lead has a density of about 11 g/cm3. The pressure is the equivalent of 300 billion atmospheres.

Before NIF was constructed, it was expected based on simulations that 10–15 MJ of fusion energy would be released, resulting in a net fusion energy gain, denoted &quot;Q&quot;, of about 5–8 (fusion energy out/UV laser energy in). Due to the design of the target chamber, the baseline design limited the maximum possible fusion energy release to 45 MJ, equivalent to about 11 kg of TNT exploding.
When NIF was built and used in 2011, the fusion energy was far lower than expected – less than 1 kJ. Performance was gradually improved until, as of 2024, the fusion energy routinely exceeded 2 MJ.

To be useful for energy production, a fusion facility must produce fusion output at least an order of magnitude more than the energy used to power the laser amplifiers – 400 MJ in the case of NIF. Commercial laser fusion systems would use much more efficient diode-pumped solid state lasers, where wall-plug efficiencies of 10 percent have been demonstrated, and efficiencies 16–18 percent were expected with advanced concepts under development in 1996.

=== Laser ===

As of 2010 NIF aimed to create a single 500 terawatt (TW) peak flash of light that reaches the target from numerous directions within a few picoseconds. The design uses 192 beamlines in a parallel system of flashlamp-pumped, neodymium-doped phosphate glass lasers.

To ensure that the output of the beamlines is uniform, the laser is amplified from a single source in the Injection Laser System (ILS). This starts with a low-power flash of 1053-nanometer (nm) infrared light generated in an ytterbium-doped optical fiber laser termed Master Oscillator. Its light is split and directed into 48 Preamplifier Modules (PAMs). Each PAM conducts a two-stage amplification process via xenon flash lamps. The first stage is a regenerative amplifier in which the pulse circulates 30 to 60 times, increasing its energy from nanojoules to tens of millijoules. The second stage sends the light four times through a circuit containing a neodymium glass amplifier similar to (but much smaller than) the ones used in the main beamlines, boosting the millijoules to about 6 joules. According to LLNL, designing the PAMs was one of the major challenges. Subsequent improvements allowed them to surpass their initial design goals.

The main amplification takes place in a series of glass amplifiers located at one end of the beamlines. Before firing, the amplifiers are first optically pumped by a total of 7,680 flash lamps. The lamps are powered by a capacitor bank that stores 400 MJ (110 kWh). When the wavefront passes through them, the amplifiers release some of the energy stored in them into the beam. The beams are sent through the main amplifier four times, using an optical switch located in a mirrored cavity. These amplifiers boost the original 6 J to a nominal 4 MJ. Given the time scale of a few nanoseconds, the peak UV power delivered to the target reaches 500 TW.

Near the center of each beamline, and taking up the majority of the total length, are &quot;spatial filters&quot;. These consist of long tubes with small telescopes at the end that focus the beam to a tiny point in the center of the tube, where a mask cuts off any stray light outside the focal point. The filters ensure that the beam image is extremely uniform. Spatial filters were a major step forward. They were introduced in the Cyclops laser, an earlier LLNL experiment.

The end-to-end length of the path the laser beam travels, including switches, is about . The various optical elements in the beamlines are generally packaged into Line Replaceable Units (LRUs), standardized boxes about the size of a vending machine that can be dropped out of the beamline for replacement from below.

After amplification is complete the light is switched back into the beamline, where it runs to the far end of the building to the target chamber. The target chamber is a multi-piece steel sphere weighing . Just before reaching the target chamber, the light is reflected off mirrors in the switchyard and target area in order to hit the target from different directions. Since the path length from the Master Oscillator to the target is different for each beamline, optics are used to delay the light in order to ensure that they all reach the center within a few picoseconds of each other. 

One of the last steps before reaching the target chamber is to convert the infrared (IR) light at 1053 nm into the ultraviolet (UV) at 351 nm in a device known as a frequency converter. These are made of thin sheets (about 1 cm thick) cut from a single crystal of potassium dihydrogen phosphate. When the 1053 nm (IR) light passes through the first of two of these sheets, frequency addition converts a large fraction of the light into 527 nm light (green). On passing through the second sheet, frequency combination converts much of the 527 nm light and the remaining 1053 nm light into 351 nm (UV) light. Infrared (IR) light is much less effective than UV at heating the targets, because IR couples more strongly with hot electrons that absorb a considerable amount of energy and interfere with compression. The conversion process can reach peak efficiencies of about 80 percent for a laser pulse that has a flat temporal shape, but the temporal shape needed for ignition varies significantly over the duration of the pulse. The actual conversion process is about 50 percent efficient, reducing delivered energy to a nominal 1.8 MJ.

As of 2010, one important aspect of any ICF research project was ensuring that experiments could be carried out on a timely basis. Previous devices generally had to cool down for many hours to allow the flashlamps and laser glass to regain their shapes after firing (due to thermal expansion), limiting their use to one or fewer firings per day. One of the goals for NIF has been to reduce this time to less than four hours, in order to allow 700 firings a year.


=== Other concepts ===
NIF is also exploring new types of targets. Previous experiments generally used plastic ablators, typically polystyrene (CH). NIF targets are constructed by coating a plastic form with a layer of sputtered beryllium or beryllium–copper alloy, and then oxidizing the plastic out of the center. Beryllium targets offer higher implosion efficiencies from x-ray inputs.

Although NIF was primarily designed as an indirect drive device, the energy in the laser as of 2008 was high enough to be used as a direct drive system, where the laser shines directly on the target without conversion to x-rays. The power delivered by NIF UV rays was estimated to be more than enough to cause ignition, allowing fusion energy gains of about 40x, somewhat higher than the indirect drive system.

As of 2005, scaled implosions on the OMEGA laser and computer simulations showed NIF to be capable of ignition using a polar direct drive (PDD) configuration where the target was irradiated directly by the laser only from the top and bottom, without changes to the NIF beamline layout. 

As of 2005, other targets, called saturn targets, were specifically designed to reduce the anisotropy and improve the implosion. They feature a small plastic ring around the &quot;equator&quot; of the target, which becomes a plasma when hit by the laser. Some of the laser light is refracted through this plasma back towards the equator of the target, evening out the heating. NIF ignition with gains of just over 35 times are thought to be possible, producing results almost as good as the fully symmetric direct drive approach.

== History ==

=== Impetus, 1957 ===
The history of ICF at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, California, started with physicist John Nuckolls, who started considering the problem after a 1957 meeting arranged by Edward Teller there. During these meetings, the idea later known as PACER emerged. PACER envisioned the explosion of small hydrogen bombs in large caverns to generate steam that would be converted into electrical power. After identifying problems with this approach, Nuckolls wondered how small a bomb could be made that would still generate net positive power.

A typical hydrogen bomb has two parts: a plutonium-based fission bomb known as the &quot;primary&quot;, and a cylindrical arrangement of fusion fuels known as the &quot;secondary&quot;. The primary releases x-rays, which are trapped within the bomb casing. They heat and compress the secondary until it ignites. The secondary consists of lithium deuteride (LiD) fuel, which requires an external neutron source. This is normally in the form of a small plutonium &quot;spark plug&quot; in the center of the fuel. Nuckolls&#x27;s idea was to explore how small the secondary could be made, and what effects this would have on the energy needed from the primary to cause ignition. The simplest change is to replace the LiD fuel with DT gas, removing the need for the spark plug. This allows secondaries of any size – as the secondary shrinks, so does the amount of energy needed for ignition. At the milligram level, the energy levels started to approach those available through several known devices.

By the early 1960s, Nuckolls and several other weapons designers had developed ICF&#x27;s outlines. The DT fuel would be placed in a small capsule, designed to rapidly ablate when heated and thereby maximize compression and shock wave formation. This capsule would be placed within an engineered shell, the hohlraum, which acts like the bomb casing. The hohlraum did not have to be heated by x-rays; any source of energy could be used as long as it delivered enough energy to heat the hohlraum and produce x-rays. Ideally the energy source would be located some distance away, to mechanically isolate both ends of the reaction. A small atomic bomb could be used as the energy source, as in a hydrogen bomb, but ideally smaller energy sources would be used. Using computer simulations, the teams estimated that about 5 MJ of energy would be needed from the primary, generating a 1 MJ beam. To put this in perspective, a small (0.5 kt ) fission primary releases 2 TJ.

=== ICF program, 1970s ===
While Nuckolls and LLNL were working on hohlraum-based concepts, UCSD physicist Keith Brueckner was independently working on direct drive. In the early 1970s, Brueckner formed KMS Fusion to commercialize this concept. This sparked an intense rivalry between KMS and the weapons labs. Formerly ignored, ICF became a hot topic and most of the labs started ICF work. LLNL decided to concentrate on glass lasers, while other facilities studied gas lasers using carbon dioxide (e.g. ANTARES, Los Alamos National Laboratory) or KrF (e.g. Nike laser, Naval Research Laboratory).

Throughout these early stages, much of the understanding of the fusion process was the result of computer simulations, primarily LASNEX. LASNEX simplified the reaction to a 2-dimensional approximation, which was all that was possible with the available computing power. LASNEX estimated that laser drivers in the kJ range could reach low gain, which was just within the state of the art. This led to the Shiva laser project which was completed in 1977. Shiva fell far short of its goals. The densities reached were thousands of times smaller than predicted. This was traced to issues with the way the laser delivered heat to the target. Most of its energy energized electrons rather than the entire fuel mass. Further experiments and simulations demonstrated that this process could be dramatically improved by using shorter wavelengths.

Further upgrades to the simulation programs, accounting for these effects, predicted that a different design would reach ignition. This system took the form of the 20-beam 200 kJ Nova laser. During the construction phase, Nuckolls found an error in his calculations, and an October 1979 review chaired by former LLNL director John S. Foster Jr. confirmed that Nova would not reach ignition. It was modified into a smaller 10-beam design that converted the light to 351 nm and increase coupling efficiency. Nova was able to deliver about 30 kJ of UV laser energy, about half of what was expected, primarily due to optical damage to the final focusing optics. Even at those levels, it was clear that the predictions for fusion production were wrong; even at the limited powers available, fusion yields were far below predictions.

=== Halite and Centurion, 1978 ===
Each experiment showed that the energy needed to reach ignition continued to be underestimated. The Department of Energy (DOE) decided that direct experimentation was the best way to settle the issue, and in 1978 they started a series of underground experiments at the Nevada Test Site that used small nuclear bombs to illuminate ICF targets. The tests were known as Halite (LLNL) and Centurion (LANL).

The basic concept behind the tests had been developed in the 1960s as a way to develop anti-ballistic missile warheads. It was found that bombs that exploded outside the atmosphere gave off bursts of X-rays that could damage an enemy warhead at long range. To test the effectiveness of this system, and to develop countermeasures to protect US warheads, the Defense Atomic Support Agency (now the Defense Threat Reduction Agency) developed a system that placed the targets at the end of long tunnels behind fast-shutting doors. The doors were timed to shut in the brief period between the arrival of the X-rays and the subsequent blast. This saved the reentry vehicle (RV) from blast damage and allowed them to be inspected.

ICF tests used the same system, replacing the RVs by hohlraums. Each test simultaneously illuminated many targets, each at a different distance from the bomb to test the effect of varying of illumination. Another question was how large the fuel assembly had to be in order for the fuel to self-heat from the fusion reactions and thus reach ignition. Initial data were available by mid-1984, and the testing ceased in 1988. Ignition was achieved for the first time during these tests. The amount of energy and the size of the fuel targets needed to reach ignition was far higher than predicted. During this same period, experiments began on Nova using similar targets to understand their behavior under laser illumination, allowing direct comparison against the bomb tests.

This data suggested that about 10 MJ of X-ray energy would be needed to reach ignition, far beyond what had earlier been calculated. If those X-rays are created by beaming an IR laser to a hohlraum, as in Nova or NIF, then dramatically more laser energy would be required, on the order of 100 MJ.

This triggered a debate in the ICF community. One group suggested an attempt to build a laser of this power; Leonardo Mascheroni and Claude Phipps designed a new type of hydrogen fluoride laser pumped by high-energy electrons and reach the 100 MJ threshold. Others used the same data and new versions of their computer simulations to suggest that careful shaping of the laser pulse and more beams spread more evenly could achieve ignition with a laser powered between 5 and 10 MJ.

These results prompted the DOE to request a custom military ICF facility named the &quot;Laboratory Microfusion Facility&quot; (LMF). LMF would use a driver on the order of 10 MJ, delivering fusion yields of between 100 and 1,000 MJ. A 1989–1990 review of this concept by the National Academy of Sciences suggested that LMF was too ambitious, and that fundamental physics needed to be further explored. They recommended further experiments before attempting to move to a 10 MJ system. Nevertheless, the authors noted, &quot;Indeed, if it did turn out that a 100 MJ driver were required for ignition and gain, one would have to rethink the entire approach to, and rationale for, ICF&quot;.

=== Laboratory Microfusion Facility and Nova Upgrade, 1990 ===
As of 1992, the Laboratory Microfusion Facility was estimated to cost about $1 billion. LLNL initially submitted a design with a 5 MJ 350 nm (UV) driver that would be able to reach about 200 MJ yield, which was enough to attain the majority of the LMF goals.That program was estimated to cost about $600 million FY 1989 dollars. An additional $250 million would pay to upgrade it to a full 1,000 MJ. The total would surpass $1 billion to meet all of the goals requested by the DOE. 

The NAS review led to a reevaluation of these plans, and in July 1990, LLNL responded with the Nova Upgrade, which would reuse most of Nova, along with the adjacent Shiva facility. The resulting system would be much lower power than the LMF concept, with a driver of about 1 MJ. The new design included features that advanced the state of the art in the driver section, including multi-pass in the main amplifiers, and 18 beamlines (up from 10) that were split into 288 &quot;beamlets&quot; as they entered the target area. The plans called for the installation of two main banks of beamlines, one in the existing Nova beamline room, and the other in the older Shiva building next door, extending through its laser bay and target area into an upgraded Nova target area. The lasers would deliver about 500 TW in a 4 ns pulse. The upgrades were expected to produce fusion yields of between 2 and 10 MJ. The initial estimates from 1992 estimated construction costs around $400 million, with construction taking place from 1995 to 1999.

=== NIF, 1994 ===
Throughout this period, the ending of the Cold War led to dramatic changes in defense funding and priorities. The political support for nuclear weapons declined and arms agreements led to a reduction in warhead count and less design work. The US was faced with the prospect of losing a generation of nuclear weapon designers able to maintain existing stockpiles, or design new weapons. At the same time, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) was signed in 1996, which would ban all criticality testing and made the development of newer generations of nuclear weapons more difficult.
Out of these changes came the Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program (SSMP), which, among other things, included funds for the development of methods to design and build nuclear weapons without having to test them explosively. In a series of meetings that started in 1995, an agreement formed between the labs to divide up SSMP efforts. An important part of this would be confirmation of computer models using low-yield ICF experiments. The Nova Upgrade was too small to use for these experiments. A redesign matured into NIF in 1994. The estimated cost of the project remained almost $1 billion, with completion in 2002.

In spite of the agreement, the large project cost combined with the ending of similar projects at other labs resulted in critical comments by scientists at other labs, Sandia National Laboratories in particular. In May 1997, Sandia fusion scientist Rick Spielman publicly stated that NIF had &quot;virtually no internal peer review on the technical issues&quot; and that &quot;Livermore essentially picked the panel to review themselves&quot;. A retired Sandia manager, Bob Puerifoy, was even more blunt than Spielman: &quot;NIF is worthless ... it can&#x27;t be used to maintain the stockpile, period&quot;. Ray Kidder, one of the original developers of the ICF concept at LLNL, was also highly critical. He stated in 1997 that its primary purpose was to &quot;recruit and maintain a staff of theorists and experimentalists&quot; and that while some of the experimental data would prove useful for weapons design, differences in the experimental setup limit their relevance. &quot;Some of the physics is the same; but the details, &#x27;wherein the devil lies,&#x27; are quite different. It would therefore also be wrong to assume that NIF will be able to support for the long term a staff of weapons designers and engineers with detailed design competence comparable to that of those now working at the weapons design laboratories.&quot;

In 1997, Victor Reis, assistant secretary for Defense Programs within DOE and SSMP chief architect defended the program telling the U.S. House Armed Services Committee that NIF was &quot;designed to produce, for the first time in a laboratory setting, conditions of temperature and density of matter close to those that occur in the detonation of nuclear weapons. The ability to study the behavior of matter and the transfer of energy and radiation under these conditions is key to understanding the basic physics of nuclear weapons and predicting their performance without underground nuclear testing.&quot; In 1998, two JASON panels, composed of scientific and technical experts, stated that NIF is the most scientifically valuable of all programs proposed for science-based stockpile stewardship.

Despite the initial criticism, Sandia, as well as Los Alamos, supported the development of many NIF technologies, and both laboratories later became partners with NIF in the National Ignition Campaign.

=== Construction of first unit, 1994–1998 ===
Work on the NIF started with a single beamline demonstrator, Beamlet. Beamlet successfully operated between 1994 and 1997. It was then sent to Sandia National Laboratories as a light source in their Z machine. A full-sized demonstrator then followed, in AMPLAB, which started operations in 1997. The official groundbreaking on the main NIF site was on May 29, 1997.

At the time, the DOE was estimating that the NIF would cost approximately $1.1 billion and another $1 billion for related research, and would be complete as early as 2002. Later in 1997 the DOE approved an additional $100 million in funding and pushed the operational date back to 2004. As late as 1998 LLNL&#x27;s public documents stated the overall price was $1.2 billion, with the first eight lasers coming online in 2001 and full completion in 2003.

The facility&#x27;s physical scale alone made the construction project challenging. By the time the &quot;conventional facility&quot; (the shell for the laser) was complete in 2001, more than 210,000 cubic yards of soil had been excavated, more than 73,000 cubic yards of concrete had been poured, 7,600 tons of reinforcing steel rebar had been placed, and more than 5,000 tons of structural steel had been erected. To isolate the laser system from vibration, the foundation of each laser bay was made independent of the rest of the structure. Three-foot-thick, 420-foot-long and 80-foot-wide slabs required continuous concrete pours to achieve their specifications.

In November 1997, an El Niño storm dumped two inches of rain in two hours, flooding the NIF site with 200,000 gallons of water just three days before the scheduled foundation pour. The earth was so soaked that the framing for the retaining wall sank six inches, forcing the crew to disassemble and reassemble it. Construction was halted in December 1997, when 16,000-year-old mammoth bones were discovered. Paleontologists were called in to remove and preserve the bones, delaying construction by four days.

A variety of research and development, technology and engineering challenges arose, such as creating an optics fabrication capability to supply the laser glass for NIF&#x27;s 7,500 meter-sized optics. State-of-the-art optics measurement, coating and finishing techniques were developed to withstand NIF&#x27;s high-energy lasers, as were methods for amplifying the laser beams to the needed energy levels. Continuous-pour glass, rapid-growth crystals, innovative optical switches, and deformable mirrors were among NIF&#x27;s technology innovations developed.

Sandia, with extensive experience in pulsed power delivery, designed the capacitor banks used to feed the flashlamps, completing the first unit in October 1998. To everyone&#x27;s surprise, the Pulsed Power Conditioning Modules (PCMs) suffered capacitor failures that led to explosions. This required a redesign of the module to contain the debris, but since the concrete had already been poured, this left the new modules so tightly packed that in-place maintenance was impossible. Another redesign followed, this time allowing the modules to be removed from the bays for servicing. Continuing problems further delayed operations, and in September 1999, an updated DOE report stated that NIF required up to $350 million more and completion occur only in 2006.

=== Re-baseline and GAO report, 1999–2000 ===
Throughout this period the problems with NIF were not reported up the management chain. In 1999 then Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson reported to Congress that NIF was on time and budget, as project leaders had reported. In August that year it was revealed that neither claim was close to the truth. As the Government Accountability Office (GAO) would later note, &quot;Furthermore, the Laboratory&#x27;s former laser director, who oversaw NIF and all other laser activities, assured Laboratory managers, DOE, the university, and the Congress that the NIF project was adequately funded and staffed and was continuing on cost and schedule, even while he was briefed on clear and growing evidence that NIF had serious problems&quot;. A DOE Task Force reported to Richardson in January 2000 that &quot;organizations of the NIF project failed to implement program and project management procedures and processes commensurate with a major research and development project... [and that] ...no one gets a passing grade on NIF Management: not the DOE&#x27;s office of Defense Programs, not the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and not the University of California&quot;.

Given the budget problems, the US Congress requested an independent GAO review. They returned a critical report in August 2000 estimating that the cost was likely to be $3.9 billion, including R&amp;D, and that the facility was unlikely to be completed anywhere near on time. The report noted management problems for the overruns, and criticized the program for failing to budget money for target fabrication, including it in operational costs instead of development.

In 2000, the DOE began a comprehensive &quot;rebaseline review&quot; because of the technical delays and project management issues, and adjusted the schedule and budget accordingly. John Gordon, National Nuclear Security Administrator, stated &quot;We have prepared a detailed bottom-up cost and schedule to complete the NIF project... The independent review supports our position that the NIF management team has made significant progress and resolved earlier problems&quot;. The report revised their budget estimate to $2.25 billion, not including related R&amp;D which pushed it to $3.3 billion total, and pushed back the completion date to 2006 with the first lines coming online in 2004. A follow-up report the next year pushed the budget to $4.2 billion, and the completion date to 2008.
The project got a new management team in September 1999, headed by George Miller, who was named acting associate director for lasers. Ed Moses, former head of the Atomic Vapor Laser Isotope Separation (AVLIS) program at LLNL, became NIF project manager. Thereafter, NIF management received many positive reviews and the project met the budgets and schedules approved by Congress. In October 2010, the project was named &quot;Project of the Year&quot; by the Project Management Institute, which cited NIF as a &quot;stellar example of how properly applied project management excellence can bring together global teams to deliver a project of this scale and importance efficiently.&quot;

=== Tests and construction completion, 2003–2009 ===
In May 2003, the NIF achieved &quot;first light&quot; on a bundle of four beams, producing a 10.4 kJ IR pulse in a single beamline. In 2005 the first eight beams produced 153 kJ of IR, eclipsing OMEGA as the planet&#x27;s highest energy laser (per pulse). By January 2007 all of the LRUs in the Master Oscillator Room (MOOR) were complete and the computer room had been installed. By August 2007, 96 laser lines were completed and commissioned, and &quot;A total infrared energy of more than 2.5 megajoules has now been fired. This is more than 40 times what the Nova laser typically operated at the time it was the world&#x27;s largest laser&quot;.

In 2005, an independent review by the JASON Defense Advisory Group that was generally positive, concluded that &quot;The scientific and technical challenges in such a complex activity suggest that success in the early attempts at ignition in 2010, while possible, is unlikely&quot;. On January 26, 2009, the final line replaceable unit (LRU) was installed, unofficially completing construction. On February 26, 2009, NIF fired all 192 laser beams into the target chamber. On March 10, 2009, NIF became the first laser to break the megajoule barrier, delivering 1.1 MJ of UV light, known as 3ω (from third-harmonic generation), to the target chamber center in a shaped ignition pulse. The main laser delivered 1.952 MJ of IR.

=== Operations, 2009–2012 ===
On May 29, 2009, the NIF was dedicated in a ceremony attended by thousands. The first laser shots into a hohlraum target were fired in late June.

==== Buildup to main experiments, 2010 ====
On January 28, 2010, NIF reported the delivery of a 669 kJ pulse to a gold hohlraum, breaking records for laser power delivery, and analysis suggested that suspected interference by generated plasma would not be a problem in igniting a fusion reaction. Due to the size of the test hohlraums, laser/plasma interactions produced plasma-optics gratings, acting like tiny prisms, which produced symmetric X-ray drive on the capsule inside the hohlraum.

After gradually altering the wavelength of the laser, scientists compressed a spherical capsule evenly and heated it to 3.3 million kelvins (285 eV). The capsule contained cryogenically cooled gas, acting as a substitute for the deuterium and tritium fuel capsules to be used later. Plasma Physics Group Leader Siegfried Glenzer said that they could maintain the precise fuel layers needed in the lab, but not yet within the laser system.

As of January 2010, the NIF reached 1.8 megajoules. The target chamber then needed to be equipped with shields to block neutrons.

==== National Ignition Campaign 2010–2012 ====

With the main construction complete, NIF started its National Ignition Campaign (NIC) to reach ignition. At the time, articles appeared in science magazines stating that ignition was imminent. &quot;Scientific American&quot; opened a 2010 review article with the statement &quot;Ignition is close now. Within a year or two...&quot;

The first test was carried out on October 8, 2010, at slightly over 1 MJ. However, problems slowed the drive toward ignition-level laser energies in the 1.4–1.5 MJ range.

One problem was the potential for damage from overheating due to a greater concentration of energy on optical components. Other issues included problems layering the fuel inside the target, and minute quantities of dust on the capsule surface.

The power level continued to increase and targets became more sophisticated. Then minute amounts of water vapor appeared in the target chamber and froze to the windows on the ends of the hohlraums, causing an asymmetric implosion. This was solved by adding a second layer of glass on either end, in effect creating a storm window.

Shots halted from February to April 2011, to conduct SSMP materials experiments. Then, NIF was upgraded, improving diagnostic and measurement instruments. The Advanced Radiographic Capability (ARC) system was added, which uses 4 of the NIF&#x27;s 192 beams as a backlight for imaging the implosion sequence. ARC is essentially a petawatt-class laser with peak power exceeding a quadrillion (1015) watts. It is designed to produce brighter, more penetrating, higher-energy x rays. ARC became the world&#x27;s highest-energy short-pulse laser, capable of creating picosecond-duration laser pulses to produce energetic x rays in the range of 50–100 keV.

NIC runs restarted in May 2011 with the goal of more precisely timing the four laser shock waves that compress the fusion target.

In January 2012, Mike Dunne, director of NIF&#x27;s laser fusion energy program, predicted that ignition would be achieved at NIF by October. In the same month, the NIF fired a record high 57 shots. On March 15 NIF produced a laser pulse with 411 TW of peak power. On July 5, it produced a shorter pulse of 1.85 MJ and increased power of 500 TW.

=== DOE Report, July 19, 2012 ===
NIC was periodically reviewed. The 6th review, was published on July 19, 2012. The report praised the quality of the installation: lasers, optics, targets, diagnostics, and operations. However:
:The integrated conclusion based on this extensive period of experimentation, however, is that considerable hurdles must be overcome to reach ignition or the goal of observing unequivocal alpha heating. Indeed the reviewers note that given the unknowns with the present &#x27;semi-empirical&#x27; approach, the probability of ignition before the end of December is extremely low and even the goal of demonstrating unambiguous alpha heating is challenging.

Further, the report expressed deep concerns that the gaps between observed performance and simulation codes implied that the current codes were of limited utility. Specifically, they found a lack of predictive ability of the radiation drive to the capsule and inadequately modeled laser–plasma interactions. Pressure was reaching only one half to one third of that required for ignition, far below the predicted values. The memo discussed the mixing of ablator material and capsule fuel likely due to hydrodynamics instabilities in the ablator&#x27;s outer surface.

The report suggested using a thicker ablator, although this would increase its inertia. To keep the required implosion speed, they proposed that the NIF energy be increased to 2MJ. It questioned whether or not the energy was sufficient to compress a large enough capsule to avoid the mix limit and reach ignition. The report concluded that ignition within the calendar year 2012 was &#x27;highly unlikely&#x27;.

NIC officially ended on September 30, 2012. Media reports suggested that NIF would shift its focus toward materials research.

In 2008, LLNL began the Laser Inertial Fusion Energy program (LIFE), to explore ways to use NIF technologies as the basis for a commercial power plant design. The focus was on pure fusion devices, incorporating technologies that developed in parallel with NIF that would greatly improve the performance of the design. In April 2014, LIFE ended.

=== Fuel gain breakeven, 2013 ===
A NIF fusion shot on September 27, 2013, produced more energy than was absorbed by the deuterium–tritium fuel. This has been confused with having reached &quot;scientific breakeven&quot;, defined as the fusion energy exceeding the laser input energy. Using this definition gives 14.4 kJ out and 1.8 MJ in, a ratio of 0.008.

=== Stockpile experiments, 2013–2015 ===
In 2013, NIF shifted focus to materials and weapons research. Experiments beginning in FY 2015 used plutonium targets. Plutonium shots simulate the compression of the primary in a nuclear bomb by high explosives, which had not seen direct testing since CNTB took effect. Plutonium use ranged from less than a milligram to 10 milligrams.

In FY 2014, NIF performed 191 shots, slightly more than one every two days. As of April 2015 NIF was on track to meet its goal of 300 laser shots in FY 2015.

=== Back to fusion, 2016–present ===
On January 28, 2016, NIF successfully executed its first gas pipe experiment intended to study the absorption of large amounts of laser light within long targets relevant to high-gain magnetized liner inertial fusion (MagLIF). In order to investigate key aspects of the propagation, stability, and efficiency of laser energy coupling at full scale for high-gain MagLIF target designs, a single quad of NIF was used to deliver 30 kJ of energy to a target during a 13 nanosecond shaped pulse. Data return was favorable.

In 2018, improvements in controlling compression asymmetry was demonstrated in a shot with an output of 1.9×1016 neutrons, resulting in 0.054 MJ of fusion energy released by a 1.5 MJ laser pulse.

=== Burning plasma achieved, 2021 ===

Experiments in 2020 and 2021 yielded the world&#x27;s first burning plasmas, in which most of the plasma heating came from nuclear fusion reactions. This result was followed on August 8, 2021 by the world&#x27;s first ignited plasma, in which the fusion heating was sufficient to sustain the thermonuclear reaction. It produced excess neutrons consistent with a short-lived chain reaction of around 100 trillionths of a second.

The fusion energy yield of the 2021 experiment was estimated to be 70% of the laser energy incident on the plasma. This result slightly beat the former record of 67% set by the JET torus in 1997. Taking the energy efficiency of the laser itself into account, the experiment used about 477 MJ of electrical energy to get 1.8 MJ of energy into the target to create 1.3 MJ of fusion energy.

Several design changes enabled this result. The material of the capsule shell was changed to diamond to increase the absorbance of secondary x-rays created by the laser burst, thus increasing the efficacy of the collapse, and its surface was further smoothed. The size of the hole in the capsule used to inject fuel was reduced. The holes in the gold cylinder surrounding the capsule were shrunk to reduce energy loss. The laser pulse was extended.

=== Scientific breakeven achieved, 2022 ===

The NIF became the first fusion experiment to achieve scientific breakeven on December 5, 2022, with an experiment producing 3.15 megajoules of energy from a 2.05 megajoule input of laser light for an energy gain of about 1.5. In a public announcement on December 13, the Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm announced the facility had achieved ignition. While this was often characterized as a &quot;net energy gain&quot; from fusion, this was only true with respect to the energy delivered by the laser; reports sometimes omitted the ~400 MJ power input required to power the facility.

The feat required the use of a slightly thicker and smoother capsule surrounding the fuel and a 2.05 MJ laser (up from 1.9 MJ in 2021), yielding 3.15 MJ, a 54% surplus. They also redistributed the energy among the split laser beams, which produced a more symmetrical (spherical) implosion.

The NIF achieved breakeven for a second time on July 30, 2023 yielding 3.88 MJ, an 89% surplus. At least four of six shots performed after the first successful one in December 2022 achieved breakeven. These successes led the DOE to fund three additional research centers. An experiment in February 2024 yielded 5.2 MJ from 2.2 MJ of input, a 136% surplus.

<text>The squacco heron (Ardeola ralloides) is a small heron, long, of which the body is , with wingspan. It is of Old World origins, breeding in southern Europe and the Greater Middle East.

==Behaviour==

The squacco heron is a migrant, wintering in Africa. It is rare north of its breeding range. The species has been recorded in Fernando de Noronha islands, and more rarely in mainland South America, as a vagrant.

This is a stocky species with a short neck, short thick bill and buff-brown back. In summer, adults have long neck feathers. Its appearance is transformed in flight, when it looks very white due to the colour of the wings.

The squacco heron&#x27;s breeding habitat is marshy wetlands in warm countries. The birds nest in small colonies, often with other wading birds, usually on platforms of sticks in trees or shrubs. Three to four eggs are laid. They feed on fish, frogs and insects. The squacco heron is a host of the Acanthocephalan intestinal parasite &quot;Ardeirhynchus spiralis&quot;.
==Etymology==
The English common name &quot;squacco&quot; comes via Francis Willughby (c. 1672) quoting a local Italian name &quot;sguacco&quot;. The current spelling comes from John Hill in 1752.

The scientific name comes from Latin &quot;ardeola&quot;, a small heron (&quot;ardea&quot;), and &quot;ralloides&quot;, Latin &quot;rallus&quot;, a rail and Greek &quot;-oides&quot;, &quot;resembling&quot;.

== Breeding ==
The Squacco Heron uses freshwater localities throughout Europe and the Middle East as breeding grounds to later migrate south to the Sub-Saharan African region. Non-breeding Squacco Herons share similar traits with other heron species like the Indian Pond Heron and Malagasy Pond Heron which show tawny color plumage, lighter streaking, smaller bill, and narrower wing tips.

<text>Leonidas Raymond Young (March 7, 1914 – July 31, 2008) was an American jazz drummer and singer. His musical family included his father Willis Young and his older brother, saxophonist Lester Young. In 1944 he played with Norman Granz&#x27;s first &quot;Jazz at the Philharmonic&quot; concert.

==Early life and education==
Young was born in 1914 in New Orleans, Louisiana to Willis Young and Lizetta Teresa Johnson. His father was a musician, as were other relatives. His older brother Lester Young became a famed saxophonist. Lee began playing from an early age and the family had a band for several years.

==Career==
In 1944 Lee Young was the drummer at Norman Granz&#x27;s first &quot;Jazz at the Philharmonic&quot; concert, which also featured guitarist Les Paul, trombonist J.J. Johnson, and saxophonist Jean-Baptiste &quot;Illinois&quot; Jacquet.

Young played with such jazz and swing music notables as Mutt Carey, Fats Waller, Les Hite, Benny Goodman, and Lionel Hampton. In the 1950s Young played with Nat King Cole&#x27;s trio. From the 1960s on, he worked as an artist &amp; repertory man for such record labels as Vee-Jay and Motown. Lee Young never recorded as a session leader.

==Personal life==
Young was married to Louise Franklin and they had a son together.

<doc id="337307" wikidata="Q14902318" url="?curid=337307" title="Object file">
<text>An object file is a file that contains machine code or bytecode, as well as other data and metadata, generated by a compiler or assembler from source code during the compilation or assembly process. The machine code that is generated is known as object code.

The object code is usually relocatable, and not usually directly executable. There are various formats for object files, and the same machine code can be packaged in different object file formats. An object file may also work like a shared library.

The metadata that object files may include can be used for linking or debugging; it includes information to resolve symbolic cross-references between different modules, relocation information, stack unwinding information, comments, program symbols, and debugging or profiling information. Other metadata may include the date and time of compilation, the compiler name and version, and other identifying information.

The term &quot;object program&quot; dates from at least the 1950s: 

A linker is used to combine the object code into one executable program or library pulling in precompiled system libraries as needed.

== Object file formats ==
There are many different object file formats; originally each type of computer had its own unique format, but with the advent of Unix and other portable operating systems, some formats, such as ELF and COFF, have been defined and used on different kinds of systems.

Some systems make a distinction between formats which are directly executable and formats which require processing by the linker. For example, OS/360 and successors call the first format a &quot;load module&quot; and the second an &quot;object module&quot;. In this case the files have entirely different formats. DOS and Windows also have different file formats for executable files and object files, such as Portable Executable for executables and COFF for object files in 32-bit and 64-bit Windows.

Unix and Unix-like systems have used the same format for executable and object files, starting with the original a.out format. Some formats can contain machine code for different processors, with the correct one chosen by the operating system when the program is loaded.

The design and/or choice of an object file format is a key part of overall system design. It affects the performance of the linker and thus programmer turnaround while a program is being developed. If the format is used for executables, the design also affects the time programs take to begin running, and thus the responsiveness for users.

The GNU Project&#x27;s Binary File Descriptor library (BFD library) provides a common API for the manipulation of object files in a variety of formats.

===Absolute files===
Many early computers, or small microcomputers, support only an absolute object format. Programs are not relocatable; they need to be assembled or compiled to execute at specific, predefined addresses. The file contains no relocation or linkage information. These files can be loaded into read/write memory, or stored in read-only memory. For example, the Motorola 6800 MIKBUG monitor contains a routine to read an absolute object file (SREC Format) from paper tape. DOS COM files are a more recent example of absolute object files.

=== Segmentation ===
Most object file formats are structured as separate sections of data, each section containing a certain type of data. These sections are known as &quot;segments&quot; due to the term &quot;memory segment&quot;, which was previously a common form of memory management. When a program is loaded into memory by a loader, the loader allocates various regions of memory to the program. Some of these regions correspond to sections of the object file, and thus are usually known by the same names. Others, such as the stack, only exist at run time. In some cases, relocation is done by the loader (or linker) to specify the actual memory addresses. However, for many programs or architectures, relocation is not necessary, due to being handled by the memory management unit or by position-independent code. On some systems the segments of the object file can then be copied (paged) into memory and executed, without needing further processing. On these systems, this may be done &quot;lazily&quot;, that is, only when the segments are referenced during execution, for example via a memory-mapped file backed by the object file.

Types of data supported by typical object file formats:
* Header (descriptive and control information)
* Code segment (&quot;text segment&quot;, executable code)
* Data segment (initialized static variables)
* Read-only data segment (&quot;rodata,&quot; initialized static constants)
* BSS segment (uninitialized static data, both variables and constants)
* External definitions and references for linking
* Relocation information
* Dynamic linking information
* Debugging information

Segments in different object files may be combined by the linker according to rules specified when the segments are defined. Conventions exist for segments shared between object files; for instance, in DOS there are different memory models that specify the names of special segments and whether or not they may be combined.

The debugging data format of debugging information may either be an integral part of the object file format, as in COFF, or a semi-independent format which may be used with several object formats, such as stabs or DWARF.

<text>William Henry Joseph Bonaparte Bertholf Smith (November 23, 1893 – April 18, 1973), nicknamed &quot;the Lion&quot;, was an American jazz and stride pianist.

==Early life and education==
William Henry Joseph Bonaparte Bertholf, known as Willie, was born in 1893 in Goshen, New York. His mother and grandmother chose his names to reflect different parts of his heritage: Joseph after Saint Joseph (Bible), Bonaparte (French), and Bertholf (biological father&#x27;s last name). William and Henry were added for &quot;spiritual balance&quot;. When he was three, his mother married John Smith, and Smith was added as the boy&#x27;s surname, after his stepfather.

In his memoir Smith reports that his father, Frank Bertholf (incorrectly spelled &quot;Bertholoff&quot; in many sources), was Jewish. Smith&#x27;s New York birth record shows him as William H. Bertholf, with father, Frank Bertholf, an electrician from nearby Monroe, New York. Smith became at least somewhat conversant in Yiddish and studied Hebrew with children of a Jewish family who were clients of his mother&#x27;s. He made his bar mitzvah at age thirteen in Newark.

His mother, Ida Oliver, had &quot;Spanish, Negro, and Mohawk Indian blood&quot;. Her mother, Ann Oliver, was a banjo player and had been in Primrose and West minstrel shows (Smith also had two cousins who were dancers in the shows, Etta and John Bloom). According to Ida, &quot;Frank Bertholoff [sic] was a light-skinned playboy who loved his liquor, girls, and gambling.&quot; She threw Frank out of the house when their son Willie was two years old. After Frank Bertholf died in 1901, his mother married John Smith, a master mechanic from Paterson, New Jersey. When Willie was three, his mother and stepfather added the surname Smith to his legal name. He grew up in a large family with his mother and stepfather in Newark, New Jersey at 76 Academy Street.

John Smith worked for C.M. Bailey, Pork Packers, and he would leave the house around midnight to pick up freshly killed pigs and take them to the packing house. He was supposed to be home by 4 am, but would usually go to bars after work. Eventually, Ida tasked the boy Willie with accompanying his stepfather to work in order to encourage him to come straight home and not go drinking. Willie said he enjoyed this task, but most of the time he had to drive the horses home. He only worked on Fridays and Saturdays, as his mother did not want him to miss school.

He later wrote in his memoir about being at the slaughterhouse with his stepfather:

 I couldn&#x27;t stand to see what I saw at the slaughterhouse. I would watch wide-eyed as the squealing pigs slid down the iron rails to the cutter where they were slashed through the middle, with the two halves falling into a tank of hot water. The kill sometimes went to as many as four hundred pigs a night. It was a sickening sight to watch. But the cries from the pigs brought forth an emotional excitement. It was another weird but musical sound that I can still hear in my head. The squeaks, the squeals, the dipping them in hot water, they put them on a hook, take off the head, the legs, going down an aisle—I hear it on an oboe. That&#x27;s what you hear in a symphony: destruction, war, peace, beauty, all mixed.

In 1907, the family moved to 90 Bloome Street in Newark. They moved again around 1912, when his stepfather got a new job at Crucible Steel Company, across the Passaic River in Harrison, New Jersey. The job paid more, and Willie was assigned to get him away from work before his bosses got him drunk on his own money.

He attended the Baxter School, rumored to be a school for bad children. The school was notorious for brawls among the ethnic Irish, Italian, and African-American children. One day Willie was in Mrs. Black&#x27;s fruit store and was caught with his hand in her register. According to his memoir, Smith had wanted to borrow a dime to see S.H. Dudley&#x27;s traveling road show at Blaney&#x27;s Theater. The owner shocked Willie by turning him over to the police. Mrs. Black&#x27;s son-in-law was the number three tough guy in Newark; reportedly the family hated policemen and generally wouldn&#x27;t allow them into their store. Willie was charged in children&#x27;s court and sentenced to a ten dollar fine and probation.

After that incident, he was transferred to Morton School (which had a lot less brawling), and began sixth grade. He attended Barringer High School (then known as Newark High School). In an effort to get the attention of girls, he attempted a variety of sports, including swimming, skating, track, basketball, sledding, cycling, and boxing. He learned to swim in the Morris Canal.

Prizefighting was the sport he was most interested in. Smith has said that &quot;maybe that because I&#x27;ve known most of the great fighters from way back. They liked to visit the night . He got to kid around with Jack Johnson, Jack Dempsey, Battling Siki, Kid Chocolate, Sam Langford, Joe Gans, Bob Fitzsimmons, Harry Greb, Joe Louis, and Gene Tunney. Fitzsimmons owned a saloon on Market Street in Newark. It was where Smith learned about Stanley Ketchel, Kid McCoy, Benny Leonard, Jimmy Britt, and Charlie Warner.

Smith also joined a gang; their club was called The Ramblers (two members were Abner Zwillman and Niggy Rutman). He was one of two African Americans in the gang; the other was Louis Moss, who Smith called a &quot;sweet talker, who could take his foes apart&quot;. Moss later became known as &quot;Big Sue&quot; and owned a saloon in the Tenderloin, Manhattan. Moss acted as his own bouncer at his club (according to Smith, Moss was 6&#x27;4&quot; and about 240 pounds). Smith used to play piano in his back room to help him out.

==Music career==
When Willie was about six, he discovered an organ in the lower house, which his mother used to play. It had deteriorated and nearly half the keys were missing. After his mother saw he was interested in it, she taught him the melodies she knew. One of the first songs he learned was &quot;Home! Sweet Home!&quot;. His uncle Rob, a bass singer who ran his own quartet, taught Willie how to dance. The boy entered an amateur dance contest at the Arcadia Theater and won first place, including a prize of ten dollars. After that, he focused more on playing music at the clubs.

Willie had wanted a new piano very badly, but every time he thought his mother was able to afford it, there was a new mouth to feed. Willie got a job at Hauseman&#x27;s Footwear store shining shoes and running errands, where he was paid five dollars a week. &quot;Old Man&quot; Hauseman paid that much because he was pleased that Willie could speak Yiddish and also because Willie wanted to buy a piano with the money. As it turned out, piano sellers Marshall &amp; Wendell&#x27;s was holding a contest: the object was to guess how many dots there were in a printed circle in their newspaper advertisement. Willie used arithmetic to help guess the number, won, and was delivered an upright piano the next day. He played the piano from then on. He would play songs he heard in the clubs, including &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot; by Scott Joplin, &quot;Cannonball Rag&quot; by Joe Northrup, &quot;Black and White Rag&quot; by George Botsford, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Hit that Lady Dressed in Green&quot;, about which he said &quot;the lyrics to this song were a sex education, especially for a twelve year old boy.&quot; His other favorites picked up from the saloons were &quot;She&#x27;s Got Good Booty&quot; and &quot;Baby, Let Your Drawers Hang Low&quot;.

By the early 1910s, he was playing at clubs in New York City and Atlantic City, New Jersey. Smith served in World War I, where he saw action in France. He also played drum with the African-American regimental band led by Tim Brymn, called &quot;The Black Devils&quot;, and basketball with the regimental team. Legend has it that his nickname &quot;The Lion&quot; came from his reported bravery while serving as a heavy artillery gunner. Smith recalled:

When they asked for volunteers to fire the French 75, I stepped forward. French Captain-in-Charge told us: &quot;Well, I think it will take you a month to learn the mechanisms, and then we&#x27;ll shoot you up to the front.&quot; I learned that mechanism in six hours. They tabbed me as an A-1 gunner right off the bat. I shot those 75&#x27;s at the Fritzies for forty-nine days straight without a break or any relief. Word got back and the Colonel came up and said: &quot;Smith, you&#x27;re a lion with that gun.&quot; That name stuck with me ever since.

He was a decorated veteran of the 350th Field Artillery, a regiment of the Buffalo Soldiers.

Around 1915, he married Blanche Merrill (née Howard). Smith and Merrill are thought to have separated before Smith joined the army in 1917, where he served as a corporal. But they were listed in the 1920 census as living together in Newark, New Jersey. Merrill was white, and Smith was the only man in their apartment building who was classified as black on this census.

He returned to working in Harlem clubs and at &quot;rent parties&quot;. Smith and his contemporaries James P. Johnson and Fats Waller developed a new, more sophisticated piano style later called &quot;stride&quot;.

In the 1940s, his music found appreciation with a wider audience. Smith toured North America and Europe up to 1971. To leave the US, he needed a birth certificate. He went to the Orange County Courthouse and found it, but discovered that the birth certificate said he was born on November 25, in contradiction to his mother telling him he was born on November 23.

==Personal life==
Smith had 10 brothers and a sister (including half-siblings). His older brother Jerome died at the age of 15. His other older brother, George, became an officer in Atlantic City, and died in 1946. Willie said of George: &quot;Our paths didn&#x27;t cross very often in later life. His friends and connections were always on the other side of the fence from mine.&quot; His half-brother Robert owned a bar on West Street in Newark. His half-brother Melvin lived on Mulberry Street in Manhattan. Smith had no idea what became of his other two half-brothers, Norman and Ralph. His other siblings died as children, ranging from ages of three to seven.

As a boy, Smith delivered clean clothes to his mother&#x27;s clients, who included a prosperous Jewish family who invited him to sit in on Hebrew lessons on Saturday mornings. Willie made his bar mitzvah in Newark at age thirteen. Later in life he worked as a Hebrew cantor for a congregation in Harlem.

==Death==
In his later years, he received frequent honors for his life&#x27;s work including a Willie &quot;the Lion&quot; Smith Day in Newark, New Jersey. Smith died at the age of 79 on April 18, 1973, in New York.

==Legacy==
The liner notes of his 1958 LP &quot;The Legend of Willie &quot;The Lion&quot; Smith&quot; (Grand Awards Records GA 33-368) state: &quot;Duke Ellington has never lost his awe of the Lion&#x27;s prowess.&quot; It quotes Ellington as saying, &quot;Willie The Lion was the greatest influence of all the great jazz piano players who have come along. He has a beat that stays in the mind.&quot; This LP&#x27;s cover, features a painting of the Lion by Tracy Sugarman. Ellington attested to his admiration when he composed and recorded &quot;Portrait of the Lion&quot; in 1939.

Orange County (NY) Executive Edward Diana issued a proclamation declaring September 18 Willie &quot;the Lion&quot; Smith Day in Orange County, the date of the first Goshen Jazz Festival.

<text>The little bittern (Botaurus minutus) is a wading bird in the heron family, Ardeidae. This species was formerly placed in the genus &quot;Ixobrychus&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The little bittern was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1766 in the twelfth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Ardea minuta&quot;. Linnaeus specified the type locality as &quot;Helvetia, Aleppo&quot; but this is now restricted to Switzerland. The little bittern was formerly placed in the genus &quot;Ixobrychus&quot;. A molecular phylogenetic study of the heron family Ardeidae published in 2023 found that &quot;Ixobrychus&quot; was paraphyletic and to create monophyletic genera, &quot;Ixobrychus&quot; was merged into the genus &quot;Botaurus&quot; that had been introduced in 1819 by the English naturalist James Francis Stephens.

Three subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;B. m. minutus&quot; (Linnaeus, 1766) – breeds in central, south Europe to central Asia and northwest India; winters in Africa
* &quot;B. m. payesii&quot; (Hartlaub, 1858) – Africa south of the Sahara
* &quot;B. m. podiceps&quot; (Bonaparte, 1855) – Madagascar

The Australian black-backed bittern (&quot;Botaurus dubius&quot;) and the extinct New Zealand bittern (&quot;Botaurus novaezelandiae&quot;) were formerly considered subspecies of the little bittern.

==Description==
The little bittern has a length of and a wing span of . It is the smallest of the breeding herons of Europe and is characterised by its tiny size, long and sharp bill and thick neck. The males are distinctively patterned and both sexes show pale forewing panels. The males have black with a faint green sheen on the crown, nape, back, tail and scapulars. The underparts are pale buff and the wing has a pinkish buff oval shaped panel which contrasts with the otherwise black wings and is formed by the inner wing coverts. The underwing is completely whiteish in colour. The female is duller than the male and has brownish black upperparts with paler feather margins visible at close range. The underparts of the female are not as clean as those of the male and are streaked with dark buff and brown. The female&#x27;s wing panel is less obvious than the male&#x27;s. The juveniles are duller and more rufous than the females and are more heavily streaked on both their upperparts and underparts, including their wing coverts.

==Distribution==
The little bittern is native to the Old World, breeding in Africa, central and southern Europe, western and southern Asia, and Madagascar. Birds from temperate regions in Europe and western Asia are migratory, wintering in Africa and further south in Asia, while those nesting in the tropics are sedentary. It is rare north of its breeding range.

In Britain there were intermittent reports of breeding in the nineteenth century, and again in 1946 and 1957, but none of these records were proven. The first proven British breeding record is from Yorkshire in 1984, and the second from the Avalon Marshes in Somerset in 2010, by 2017 this species had been present in this area for nine consecutive years.

==Behaviour==
The little bittern is crepuscular, skulking and normally solitary. It feeds on fishes, amphibians and insects which are caught within reedbeds or at their edges by the bird slowly stalking the prey. The male claims a territory in the Spring, advertising his presence with a deep barking or croaking call and the monogamous pair remain together for at least one breeding season. Eggs are laid in a nest situated in dense reedbeds, rushes or bushes above the water from the middle of May and there is a single brood which is normally 5-6 eggs. These are incubated for 17–19 days and the chicks are fledged after 25–30 days.

In Europe the little bittern is a migratory species, crossing the Mediterranean from Africa in the early Spring and arriving in their breeding wetlands from mid April onwards. The return to Africa occurs in August and September and there are normally only a few juveniles left in Europe by October. The European breeders migrate as far south as the Eastern Cape and Transvaal.

The little bittern is a host of the Acanthocephalan intestinal parasite &quot;Ardeirhynchus spiralis&quot;.

==Conservation status==
Little Bitterns were once widespread in Central Europe. In the meantime it is a poorly distributed breeding bird of the lowlands, sporadically up to low mountain ranges. It occurs from Europe (without regular breeding in Great Britain, Ireland or Scandinavia) to West Siberia up to 56° N. It also occurs in North Africa and southern Iran and south of the Sahara to southern Africa. Isolated populations also exist in Madagascar and Australia. The total population of Europe is about 60,000-120,000 breeding pairs, with occurrences of&gt; 5000 breeding pairs in Russia, Ukraine, Romania and Turkey. In Central Europe (around 2000) about 5300-7800 pairs are breeding, most of it in Hungary. The formerly large population in Germany has decreased to just over 100 breeding pairs. However, inventory information is particularly unreliable for this very secret species.

The little bittern is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds applies.

<text>Aquaporins, also called water channels, are channel proteins from a larger family of major intrinsic proteins that form pores in the membrane of biological cells, mainly facilitating transport of water between cells. The cell membranes of a variety of different bacteria, fungi, animal and plant cells contain aquaporins through which water can flow more rapidly into and out of the cell than by diffusing through the phospholipid bilayer. Aquaporins have six membrane-spanning alpha helical domains with both carboxylic and amino terminals on the cytoplasmic side. Two hydrophobic loops contain conserved asparagine–proline–alanine (&quot;NPA motif&quot;) which form a barrel surrounding a central pore-like region that contains additional protein density. Because aquaporins are usually always open and are prevalent in just about every cell type, this leads to a misconception that water readily passes through the cell membrane down its concentration gradient. Water can pass through the cell membrane through simple diffusion because it is a small molecule, and through osmosis, in cases where the concentration of water outside of the cell is greater than that of the inside. However, because water is a polar molecule this process of simple diffusion is relatively slow, and in tissues with high water permeability the majority of water passes through aquaporin.

The 2003 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded jointly to Peter Agre for the discovery of aquaporins and Roderick MacKinnon for his work on the structure and mechanism of potassium channels.

Genetic defects involving aquaporin genes have been associated with several human diseases including nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and neuromyelitis optica.

== History ==
The mechanism of facilitated water transport and the probable existence of water pores has attracted researchers since 1957. In most cells, water moves in and out by osmosis through the lipid component of cell membranes. Due to the relatively high water permeability of some epithelial cells, it was long suspected that some additional mechanism for water transport across membranes must exist. Solomon and his co-workers performed pioneering work on water permeability across the cell membrane in the late 1950s. In the mid-1960s an alternative hypothesis (the &quot;partition–diffusion model&quot;) sought to establish that the water molecules partitioned between the water phase and the lipid phase and then diffused through the membrane, crossing it until the next interphase where they left the lipid and returned to an aqueous phase. Studies by Parisi, Edelman, Carvounis et al. accented not only the importance of the presence of water channels but also the possibility to regulate their permeability properties. In 1990, Verkman&#x27;s experiments demonstrated functional expression of water channels, indicating that water channels are effectively proteins.

== Discovery ==
It was not until 1992 that the first aquaporin, &#x27;aquaporin-1&#x27; (originally known as CHIP 28), was reported by Peter Agre, of Johns Hopkins University. In 1999, together with other research teams, Agre reported the first high-resolution images of the three-dimensional structure of an aquaporin, namely, aquaporin-1. Further studies using supercomputer simulations identified the pathway of water as it moved through the channel and demonstrated how a pore can allow water to pass without the passage of small solutes. The pioneering research and subsequent discovery of water channels by Agre and his colleagues won Agre the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2003. Agre said he discovered aquaporins &quot;by serendipity.&quot; He had been studying the Rh blood group antigens and had isolated the Rh molecule, but a second molecule, 28 kilodaltons in size (and therefore called 28K) kept appearing. At first they thought it was a Rh molecule fragment, or a contaminant, but it turned out to be a new kind of molecule with unknown function. It was present in structures such as kidney tubules and red blood cells, and related to proteins of diverse origins, such as in fruit fly brain, bacteria, the lens of the eye, and plant tissue.

However the first report of protein-mediated water transport through membranes was by Gheorghe Benga and others in 1986, prior to Agre&#x27;s first publication on the topic. This led to a controversy that Benga&#x27;s work had not been adequately recognized either by Agre or by the Nobel Prize Committee.

== Function ==

Aquaporins are &quot;the plumbing system for cells&quot;. Water moves through cells in an organized way, most rapidly in tissues that have aquaporin water channels. For many years, scientists assumed that water leaked through the cell membrane, and some water does. However, this did not explain how water could move so quickly through some cells.

Aquaporins selectively conduct water molecules in and out of the cell, while preventing the passage of ions and other solutes. Also known as water channels, aquaporins are integral membrane pore proteins. Some of them, known as aquaglyceroporins, also transport other small uncharged dissolved molecules including ammonia, CO2, glycerol, and urea. For example, the aquaporin 3 channel has a pore width of 8–10 Ångströms and allows the passage of hydrophilic molecules ranging between 150 and 200 Da. However, the water pores completely block ions including protons, essential to conserve the membrane&#x27;s electrochemical potential difference.

Water molecules traverse through the pore of the channel in single file. The presence of water channels increases membrane permeability to water. These are also essential for the water transport system in plants and tolerance to drought and salt stresses.

== Structure ==


Aquaporin proteins are composed of a bundle of six transmembrane α-helices. They are embedded in the cell membrane. The amino and carboxyl ends face the inside of the cell. The amino and carboxyl halves resemble each other, apparently repeating a pattern of nucleotides. This may have been created by the doubling of a formerly half-sized gene. Between the helices are five regions (A – E) that loop into or out of the cell membrane, two of them hydrophobic (B, E), with an asparagine–proline–alanine (&quot;NPA motif&quot;) pattern. They create a distinctive hourglass shape, making the water channel narrow in the middle and wider at each end.

Another and even narrower place in the AQP1 channel is the &quot;ar/R selectivity filter&quot;, a cluster of amino acids enabling the aquaporin to selectively let through or block the passage of different molecules.

Aquaporins form four-part clusters (tetramers) in the cell membrane, with each of the four monomers acting as a water channel. Different aquaporins have different sized water channels, the smallest types allowing nothing but water through.

X-ray profiles show that aquaporins have two conical entrances. This hourglass shape could be the result of a natural selection process toward optimal permeability. It has been shown that conical entrances with suitable opening angle can indeed provide a large increase of the hydrodynamic channel permeability.

=== NPA motif ===

Aquaporin channels appear in simulations to allow only water to pass, as the molecules effectively queue up in single file. Guided by the aquaporin&#x27;s local electric field, the oxygen in each water molecule faces forwards as it enters, turning around half way along and leaving with the oxygen facing backwards. The arrangement of opposite-facing electrostatic potentials in the two halves of the channel prevents the flow of protons but permits water to pass freely.

=== ar/R selectivity filter ===

The aromatic/arginine or &quot;ar/R&quot; selectivity filter is a cluster of amino acids that help bind to water molecules and exclude other molecules that may try to enter the pore. It is the mechanism by which the aquaporin is able to selectively bind water molecules and so to allow them through, and to prevent other molecules from entering. The ar/R filter is made of two amino acid groups from helices B (HB) and E (HE) and two groups from loop E (LE1, LE2), from the two sides of the NPA motif. Its usual position is 8 Å on the outer side of the NPA motif; it is typically the tightest part of the channel. Its narrowness weakens the hydrogen bonds between water molecules, enabling the arginines, which carry a positive charge, to interact with the water molecules and to filter out undesirable protons.

== Taxonomic distribution ==

=== In mammals ===

There are thirteen known types of aquaporins in mammals; six of these are located in the kidney, but the existence of many more is suspected. The most studied aquaporins are compared in the following table:

=== In plants ===

In plants, water is taken up from the soil through the roots, where it passes from the cortex into the vascular tissues. There are three routes for water to flow in these tissues, known as the apoplastic, symplastic and transcellular pathways. Specifically, aquaporins are found in the vacuolar membrane, in addition to the plasma membrane of plants; the transcellular pathway involves transport of water across the plasma and vacuolar membranes. When plant roots are exposed to mercuric chloride, which is known to inhibit aquaporins, the flow of water is greatly reduced while the flow of ions is not, supporting the view that there exists a mechanism for water transport independent of the transport of ions: aquaporins. Aquaporins can play a major role in extension growth by allowing an influx of water into expanding cells - a process necessary to sustain plant development. Plant aquaporins are important for mineral nutrition and ion detoxification; these are both essential for the homeostasis of minerals such as boron. 

Aquaporins in plants are separated into four main homologous subfamilies, or groups:
* Plasma membrane Intrinsic Protein (PIP)
* Tonoplast Intrinsic Protein (TIP)
* Nodulin-26 like Intrinsic Protein (NIP)
* Small basic Intrinsic Protein (SIP)

These five subfamilies have later been divided into smaller evolutionary subgroups based on their DNA sequence. PIPs cluster into two subgroups, PIP1 and PIP2, whilst TIPs cluster into 5 subgroups, TIP1, TIP2, TIP3, TIP4 and TIP5. Each subgroup is again split up into isoforms e.g. PIP1;1, PIP1;2. As isoforms nomenclature are historically based on functional parameters rather than evolutive ones, several novel propositions on plant aquaporines have been arisen with the study of the evolutionary relationships between the different aquaporins. Within the various selection of aquaporin isoforms in plants, there are also unique patterns of cell- and tissue-specific expression.

When plant aquaporins are silenced, the hydraulic conductance and photosynthesis of the leaf decrease. When gating of plant aquaporins occurs, it stops the flow of water through the pore of the protein. This may happen for various reasons, for example when the plant contains low amounts of cellular water due to drought. The gating of an aquaporin is carried out by an interaction between a gating mechanism and the aquaporin, which causes a 3D change in the protein so that it blocks the pore and, thus, disallows the flow of water through the pore. In plants, there are at least two forms of aquaporin gating: gating by the dephosphorylation of certain serine residues, in response to drought, and the protonation of specific histidine residues, in response to flooding. The phosphorylation of an aquaporin is involved in the opening and closing of petals in response to temperature.

=== In Heteroconts ===

Specific aquaporins called Large Intrinsic Proteins (LIP) have been found in Heterokonts, including diatoms and brown algae. LIPs contain an NPM-motif in place of the second conserved NPA-motif typical of the majority of MIPs.

=== In other organisms ===

Aquaporins have been discovered in the fungi &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; (yeast), &quot;Dictyostelium&quot;, &quot;Candida&quot; and &quot;Ustilago&quot; and the protozoans &quot;Trypanosoma&quot; and &quot;Plasmodium&quot;.

== Clinical significance ==

There have been two clear examples of diseases identified as resulting from mutations in aquaporins: mutations in the aquaporin-2 gene cause hereditary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in humans, while mice homozygous for inactivating mutations in the aquaporin-0 gene develop congenital cataracts. A small number of people have been identified with severe or total deficiency in aquaporin-1. They are, in general, healthy, but exhibit a defect in the ability to concentrate solutes in the urine and to conserve water when deprived of drinking water. Mice with targeted deletions in aquaporin-1 also exhibit a deficiency in water conservation due to an inability to concentrate solutes in the kidney medulla by countercurrent multiplication. Aquaporins play a key role in acquired forms of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, disorders that cause increased urine production. Aquaporin 2 is regulated by vasopressin which, when bound to the cell-surface receptor, activates the cAMP signaling pathway. This results in aquaporin-2 containing vesicles to increase water uptake and return to circulation. Mutation of the aquaporin 2 vasopressin receptor is a cause of acquired diabetes insipidus. In rats, acquired nephrogenic diabetes insipidus can be caused by impaired regulation of aquaporin-2 due to administration of lithium salts, low potassium concentrations in the blood (hypokalemia) and high calcium concentrations in the blood (hypercalcemia). Autoimmune reactions against aquaporin 4 in humans produce Devic&#x27;s disease. If aquaporin could be manipulated, that could potentially solve medical problems such as fluid retention in heart disease and brain edema after stroke.

In principle there is little difference between a high-performance IRBM and a low-performance ICBM, because decreasing payload mass can increase the range over the ICBM threshold. The range definition used here is used within the U.S. Missile Defense Agency.

==History==
The progenitor for the IRBM was the A4b rocket, winged for increased range and based on the famous V-2, Vergeltung, or &quot;Reprisal&quot;, officially called A4, rocket designed by Wernher von Braun. The V-2 was widely used by Nazi Germany at the end of World War II to bomb English and Belgian cities. The A4b was the prototype for the upper stage of the A9/A10 rocket. The goal of the program was to build a missile capable of hitting New York, when launched from France or Spain (see Amerika Bomber).

A4b rockets were tested a few times in December 1944 and January and February 1945. All of these rockets used liquid propellant. The A4b used an inertial guidance system, while the A9 would have been controlled by a pilot. They started from a non-mobile launch pad.

Following World War II, von Braun and other lead Nazi scientists were secretly transferred to the United States, to work directly for the U.S. Army through Operation Paperclip, developing the V-2 into the weapon for the United States.

IRBMs are currently operated by the People&#x27;s Republic of China, India, Israel, North Korea, and Russia. The United States, USSR, Pakistan, United Kingdom, and France were former operators.

==Nomenclature==
There is no clearly agreed-upon distinction between an intermediate-range and a medium range (MRBM) missile, and the categories overlap. Different sources classify missiles in different ways. They are both distinct from ICBMs, in that they have a range that is less than intercontinental, and hence must be based relatively close to the target. An IRBM, in general, is intended as a strategic weapon, while a MRBM, in general, is intended as a theatre ballistic missile.

<text>The collared pratincole (Glareola pratincola), also known as the common pratincole or red-winged pratincole, is a wader in the pratincole family, Glareolidae. As with other pratincoles, it is native to the Old World.

==Taxonomy==
The collared pratincole was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1766 in the twelfth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the swallows and swifts in the genus &quot;Hirundo&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Hirundo pratincola&quot;. The collared pratincole is now placed in the genus &quot;Glareola&quot; that was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The genus name is a diminutive of Latin &quot;glarea&quot;, &quot;gravel&quot;, referring to a typical nesting habitat for pratincoles. The species name &quot;pratincola&quot; means an inhabitant of meadows, from Latin &quot;pratum, prati&quot;, &quot;meadow&quot; and &quot;incola&quot;, &quot;inhabitant&quot;, from &quot;incolere&quot;, &quot;to inhabit&quot;.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;Glareola pratincola pratincola&quot;, – southern Europe &amp; North Africa to south Pakistan
* &quot;Glareola pratincola fuelleborni&quot;, – sub-Saharan Africa from Senegal to central Ethiopia and south Somalia south to east South Africa (includes &quot;erlangeri&quot; and &quot;riparia&quot;)

==Description==
This pratincole is long with a wingspan. It has short legs, long pointed wings, a long forked tail, and a short bill, which is an adaptation to aerial feeding. The back and head are brown, and the wings are brown with darker flight feathers. The belly is white. The underwings are chestnut, but look dark below.

Very good views are needed to distinguish this species from other pratincoles, such as the black-winged pratincole and the oriental pratincole, which may occur in its range. The latter species also has a chestnut underwing, but is shorter-tailed.

==Distribution and habitat==
The collared pratincole is a bird of open country, and is often seen near water in the evening, hawking for insects. It is found in the warmer parts of Europe, southwest Asia and Africa. It is migratory, wintering in tropical Africa, and is rare north of the breeding range.

==Behaviour==
===Feeding===
Pratincoles are unusual among waders in that they typically hunt their insect prey on the wing like swallows, although they can also feed on the ground.

===Breeding===

The nesting is colonial. The nest is a shallow scrape on open ground often near water. 
The clutch is 2–4 eggs which have a cream background with black or dark brown blotches, spots or streaks. On average the eggs measure and weigh . Beginning after the last egg is laid, they are incubated by both parents and hatch synchronously after 17-19 days. The young are precocial and nidifugous. They leave the nest after 2–3 days and are then cared for by both parents who feed them with regurgitated food for the first week. The young fledge when they are 25–30 days of age.

==Status and conservation==
The collared pratincole is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

<text>Fate Marable (December 2, 1890 – January 16, 1947) was an American jazz pianist and bandleader.

==Early life==
Marable was born in Paducah, Kentucky to James and Elizabeth Lillian (Wharton) Marable, a piano teacher. Fate had five siblings, including two brothers, Harold and James, and three sisters, Mabel, Juanita, and Neona. Elizabeth Marable, known as &quot;Lizzie,&quot; gave her son music lessons, both in reading music and playing piano.

==Music career==
At the age of 17, Marable began playing on the steam boats plying the Mississippi River. John and Joseph Streckfus hired him to replace their piano player, Charles Mills, who had accepted an engagement in New York City. There was a catch: Marable&#x27;s responsibilities would include playing a large steam calliope. Steam streamed through the brass pipes and whistles at 80 pounds of pressure, the keys were hot and they were hard to hold down. Pitch varied with steam pressure, so there was a challenge of playing in tune. The calliope was designed to be clearly heard on shore, so the volume was overwhelming to the musician who was manipulating it. To prepare himself for playing the loud machine that spewed steam and water, Marable wore gloves, stuffed his ears with cotton, and donned raingear.

Later in 1907, he became bandleader for a paddlewheeler on the Streckfus Line running between New Orleans, Louisiana and St. Paul, Minnesota, a position he retained for 33 years. Later, he spent late nights in New Orleans&#x27; clubs scouting for talent and playing at jam sessions. There he discovered Louis Armstrong blowing cornet, and recruited him to play for his band on evening riverboat excursions cruising around the Crescent City.

As a bandleader, Marable shared the lessons from his mother with his musicians. Many of the musicians he hired played by ear, and he augmented their skills by teaching them to read music, and expected them all to learn how to play from sheet music on sight. As his one-time drummer, Zutty Singleton put it: &quot;There was a saying in New Orleans. When some musician would get a job on the riverboats with Fate Marable, they&#x27;d say, &#x27;Well, you&#x27;re going to the conservatory.&#x27;&quot; While he was training these musicians to better perform the dance arrangements for the steamboat passengers, he also boosted many of their careers when they were ready to move on. Streckfus Steamers&#x27; alumni went on to play with bandleaders such as Cab Calloway, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Jimmie Lunceford, Fats Waller, and Chick Webb.

Members of Marable&#x27;s bands were expected to be able to play a wide variety of music, from hot numbers to light classics, playing by memory or ear, and from sheet music. Above all they were expected to keep the dancers happy. Marable was a strict bandleader, demanding musical proficiency and rigid discipline from all his bandmembers, yet allowing them to develop their individual strong points. For instance, Louis Armstrong&#x27;s gift for improvisation was recognised as such by Marable, and he allowed him to improvise his breaks rather than play them note for note. Marable&#x27;s band served as an early musical education for many other players who would later become prominent in jazz, including Red Allen, Baby Dodds, Johnny Dodds, Pops Foster, Erroll Garner, Narvin Kimball, Al Morgan, Jimmy Blanton, Elbert Pee Wee Claybrook, , and Zutty Singleton.

In 1916, Marable published the only original composition of his career, &quot;Barrell House Rag&quot;, co-written with Clarence Williams.

A young George Russell, later the deviser of the &quot;Lydian Concept&quot;, grew up listening to Marable&#x27;s music.

==Death==
Fate Marable died of pneumonia in St. Louis, Missouri. He was 56 years old. He is buried in Oak Grove Cemetery in Paducah, Kentucky.

<text>The Binary File Descriptor library (BFD) is the GNU Project&#x27;s main mechanism for the portable manipulation of object files in a variety of formats. , it supports approximately 50 file formats and 25 instruction set architectures.

==History==
When David Henkel-Wallace of Cygnus Support proposed developing the library as a way to open up new business opportunities for the company, Richard Stallman said that it would be difficult; David&#x27;s response was that it wasn&#x27;t such a &quot;Big Fucking Deal&quot;. Abbreviated to &quot;BFD&quot;, this became the library name. &quot;Binary File Descriptor&quot; was invented later as a backronym for &quot;BFD&quot;.

== Design ==

BFD works by presenting a common abstract view of object files. An object file has a &quot;header&quot; with descriptive info; a variable number of &quot;sections&quot; that each has a name, some attributes, and a block of data; a symbol table; relocation entries; and so forth.

Internally, BFD translates the data from the abstract view into the details of the bit/byte layout required by the target processor and file format. Its key services include handling byte order differences, such as between a little-endian host and big-endian target, correct conversion between 32-bit and 64-bit data, and details of address arithmetic specified by relocation entries.

BFD library can be logically divided into two parts. The front-end and the back-end. The front-end gives a common interface independent of underlying object file view. Users will be interacting with the object files with this interface. Even if the layout of the object files are not known to the user, the user would still be able to use the interface. This hiding of the detail is done with the help of the back-end. The back-end implements how the front-end interface interacts with the object files layout. Whenever a new object files type is introduced the back-end needs to register the type and implement it if it needs to be supported by the BFD application.

Although BFD was originally designed to be a generic library usable by a wide variety of tools, the frequent need to tinker with the API to accommodate new systems&#x27; capabilities has tended to limit its use; BFD&#x27;s main clients are the GNU Assembler (GAS), GNU Linker (GLD), and other GNU Binary Utilities (&quot;binutils&quot;) tools, and the GNU Debugger (GDB). As a result, BFD is not distributed separately, but is always included with releases of binutils and GDB. Nevertheless, BFD is a critical component in the use of GNU tools for embedded systems development.

The BFD library can be used to read the structured data out of a core dump.

==BFD library usage==
Eg: Print object file size using bfd library APIs.
#include &quot;bfd.h&quot;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
 bfd* abfd = bfd_openr(&quot;a.o&quot;,NULL); 
 printf(&quot;%llu\n&quot;, bfd_get_size(abfd));
 return 0;

<doc id="337346" wikidata="Q626510" url="?curid=337346" title="Blessing">
<text>In religion, a blessing (also used to refer to bestowing of such) is the impartation of something with grace, holiness, spiritual redemption, or divine will.

== Etymology and Germanic paganism ==
The modern English language term &quot;bless&quot; likely derives from the 1225 term , which developed from the Old English (preserved in the Northumbrian dialect around 950 AD). The term also appears in other forms, such as (before 830), from around 725 and &quot;&quot; from around 1000, all meaning to make sacred or holy by a sacrificial custom in the Anglo-Saxon pagan period, originating in Germanic paganism; to mark with blood. Due to this, the term is related to the term , meaning &#x27;blood&#x27;. References to this indigenous practice, Blót, exist in related Icelandic sources.

The modern meaning of the term may have been influenced in translations of the Bible into Old English during the process of Christianization to translate the Latin term meaning &#x27;to speak well of&#x27;, resulting in meanings such as &#x27;to praise&#x27; or &#x27;extol&#x27; or &#x27;to speak of&#x27; or &#x27;to wish well&#x27;.

==Abrahamic religions==
&#x27;To be blessed&#x27; means to be favored by God, the source of all blessing. Blessings, therefore, are directly associated with, and are believed to come from, God. Thus, to express a blessing is like bestowing a wish on someone that they experience the favor of God, and to acknowledge God as the source of all blessing.

A biblical damnation, in its most formal sense, is a negative blessing.

In the Bible, positive and negative blessings are related; the book of Deuteronomy prescribes that obedience to the Law of Moses brings God&#x27;s blessing. One of the first incidences of blessing in the Bible is in Genesis, where Abram is ordered by the God to leave his country and is told:

The Priestly Blessing is set forth at Numbers :

: May Adonai bless you, and guard you;
: May Adonai make His countenance shine upon you, and be gracious to you;
: May Adonai turn His countenance to you and grant you peace.

===Judaism===
In Rabbinic Judaism, a blessing (or &quot;berakhah&quot;) is recited at a specified moment during a prayer, ceremony or other activity, especially before and after partaking of food. The function of blessings is to acknowledge God as the source of all blessing. A &quot;berakhah&quot; of rabbinic origin typically starts with the words, &quot;Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe...&quot; Rabbinic Judaism teaches that food ultimately is a gift of the one great Provider, God, and that to partake of food legitimately one should express gratitude to God by reciting the appropriate blessing of rabbinic origin prior, while torah mandates an informal blessing afterwards. Jewish law does not reserve recitation of blessings to only a specific class of Jews; but it does mandate specific blessings to specific occasions, so that, for example since medieval times, Jewish women chiefly recite a rabbinic blessing after lighting two Shabbat candles.

===Christianity===

Blessings and curses of Christ appear in the New Testament, as recounted in the Beatitudes of Luke 6:20-22. Within Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Anglicanism, Lutheranism, and similar traditions, formal blessings of the church are performed by bishops, priests, and deacons. Particular formulas may be associated with episcopal blessings and papal blessings. In Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican, and Lutheran churches blessings are bestowed by bishops and priests in a liturgical context, raising their right hand and making the sign of the cross with it over persons or objects to be blessed. They also give blessings to begin divine services and at the dismissal at the end.

In the Eastern Orthodox Church liturgical blessings are performed over people, objects, or are given at specific points during divine services. A priest or bishop usually blesses with his hand, but may use a blessing cross, candles, an icon, the Chalice or Gospel Book to bestow blessings, always making the Sign of the Cross therewith. When blessing with the hand, a priest uses his right hand, holding his fingers so that they form the Greek letters IC XC, the monogram of Jesus Christ. A bishop does the same, except he uses both hands, or may hold the crozier in his left hand, using both to make the Sign of the Cross. A bishop may also bless with special candlesticks known as the dikirion and trikirion. When blessing an object, the rubrics often instruct Orthodox bishops and priests to make use of such substances as incense and holy water. Also, formal ecclesiastical permission to undertake an action is referred to as a &quot;blessing&quot;. The blessing may be bestowed by a bishop or priest, or by one&#x27;s own spiritual father. When an Orthodox layperson bestows a blessing, he or she will hold the thumb and first two fingers of the right hand together (the same configuration used when making the Sign of the Cross on themselves), and make the sign of the cross over the person or object they are blessing.

In Protestant liturgies such as those of Reformed churches or Evangelical churches, the minister blesses the congregation during the concluding part of the service of worship, known as the benediction. For example, the Orthodox Presbyterian Directory for Public Worship states that &quot;Unless necessary, none should depart until after the benediction,&quot; and &quot;by his Spirit working through the ministry of the Word, God addresses his people in the call to worship, in the salutation and benediction, in the reading and preaching of the Word, and in the 
sacraments.&quot; The Methodist &quot;The Book of Worship for Church and Home&quot; (1965) contains &quot;An Office for the Blessing of a Dwelling&quot;.

In the Roman Catholic Church a priest or bishop blesses the faithful with the Blessed Sacrament in the monstrance during Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament. According to the guidelines given by the Vatican&#x27;s Congregation for the Discipline of the Sacraments that govern the procedures for liturgical ceremonies, if a Roman Catholic layperson (a lay acolyte or parish administrator, for example) or any non-ordained religious (who is not the superior of the congregation) leads a Sunday service (other than a Mass, which requires a priest to celebrate), such as Eucharistic adoration, the Rosary, or celebration of the Liturgy of the Hours, he or she does not perform rites or sacraments reserved to the clergy and does not solemnly bless the people as a bishop, priest, or deacon would at the end of the service; an alternative format is used instead.

In the Lutheran Churches, priests are often asked to bless objects frequently used by or sacred to individuals, such as a cross necklace; in addition, Lutheran clergy also bless the homes of members of the congregations.

In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, blessings are given by worthy, male members who hold the Melchizedek priesthood.

===Islam===

Blessings in Islam have two aspects, according to major scholars of Islam. Blessings are given by Allah as a trial for mankind. Scholars of Islam believe that having fear of being gradually misled by blessings is an attribute of the pious, and not having fear from such even though one is constantly misbehaving is an attribute of the impious. Blessings can be a source of success in the afterlife if one is grateful to Allah for them and the same blessings can be a source for damnation in afterlife if a person is not constantly grateful to God for them.

Islam has no clerical caste, and therefore no blessings reserved to specific individuals. Muslims will frequently pronounce &quot;peace and blessings be upon him&quot; when mentioning the name of Muhammad or indeed, any of the prophets. Muslims will also greet one another with a blessing every time they meet and depart: (meaning &quot;may peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you&quot;).

==Dharma religions==
Indian religions, which includes Hinduism and other religions like Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, etc. are also called Dharmic religions, all of which are based on the different concept of dharma and karma and typical blessings are based on Adhiṣṭhāna, Añjali Mudrā, Darśana and Mudra, etc.

===Hinduism===

In Hinduism Puja is a religious ritual performed by Hindus as an offering to various deities, distinguished persons, or special guests. It is modeled on the idea of giving a gift or offering to a deity or important person and receiving their approval (). During the Puja involves an &#x27;Aarti plate&#x27; or &#x27;Aarti lamp&#x27; is circulating around a deity or person and is generally accompanied by the singing of songs in praise of that deity or person (many versions exist). In doing so, the plate or lamp is supposed to acquire the power of the deity. The priest circulates the plate or lamp to all those present. They cup their down-turned hands over the flame and then raise their palms to their forehead – the purificatory blessing, passed from the deity&#x27;s image to the flame, has now been passed to the devotee.

During the naivedya ritual, a devotee makes an offering of a material substance such as flowers, fruits, or sweets. The deity then &#x27;enjoys&#x27; or tastes a bit of the offering, which is then temporarily known as bhogya. This now-divinely invested substance is called prasāda, and is received by the devotee to be ingested, worn, etc. It may be the same material that was originally offered, or material offered by others and then re-distributed to other devotees. In many temples, several kinds of prasada (e.g. nuts, sweets) are distributed to the devotees.
&quot;Darshan&quot; is a term meaning &#x27;sight&#x27; (in the sense of an instance of seeing or beholding; from a root &#x27;to see&#x27;), vision, apparition, or glimpse. It is most commonly used for &quot;visions of the divine,&quot; e.g., of a god or a very holy person or artifact. One could &quot;receive &quot; of the deity in the temple, or from a great saintly person, such as a great guru. The touching of the feet () is a show of respect and it is often an integral part of . Children touch the feet of their family elders while people of all ages will bend to touch the feet of a great guru, murti (icon) of a Deva (God) (such as Rama or Krishna).

There is a special link between worshipper and guru during pujas, in which people may touch the guru&#x27;s feet in respect (Pranāma), or remove the dust from a guru&#x27;s feet before touching their own head.

Another tradition is (Hindi) or (Tamil ) &#x27;vehicle blessing&#x27;. This is a ritual that is performed when one purchases a new vehicle.
===Buddhism===
In &quot;Mangala Sutta&quot;, Lord Buddha describes &#x27;blessings&#x27; that are wholesome personal pursuits or attainments, identified in a progressive manner from the mundane to the ultimate spiritual goal.

Blessings in Buddhism, certain ceremonies are meant to provide blessings.

==Other uses==

&quot;Blessing&quot; is also a term used for marriage in the Unification Church, &quot;see:&quot; Blessing Ceremony of the Unification Church.

Clergy will normally receive a blessing from their ecclesiastical superiors to begin their ministry. In the Russian Orthodox Church pious laymen would go to a starets (elder) to receive his or her blessing before embarking upon any important work or making a major decision in their life. In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a member may receive a special blessing, known as a patriarchal blessing, as guidance.

In the U.S., there are sometimes ritual ceremonies to bless companion animals.

In Hawaii anything new (a new building, a new stretch of road to be opened, a new garden) receives a blessing by a Hawaiian practitioner (or Kahuna) in a public ceremony (involving also the unwinding of e.g. a maile lei).

In Spanish, there is a blessing which can be used as a tender , especially from a parent: (&#x27;Go with God&#x27;), also (, &#x27;to God&#x27;), similar to the French .

In the Kyrgyz people&#x27;s tradition, the blessing ( or , &#x27;the right blessing&#x27; or &#x27;white blessing&#x27;) might be a good wish to somebody by the oldest person or the person with the best reputation before the travel or launch of some activity of the person who seeks such a blessing and moral support. The procedure might be from the pre-Islamic local nomadic traditions with deep family values. Sometimes, older might give a negative blessing (so-called – &#x27;the opposite blessing&#x27; or &#x27;the black blessing&#x27;).

In commercial interactions, a seller&#x27;s good words about the product, such as &quot;I hope you enjoy it,&quot; could be considered to be blessings.

<doc id="337353" wikidata="Q222067" url="?curid=337353" title="Safety data sheet">
<text>A safety data sheet (SDS), material safety data sheet (MSDS), or product safety data sheet (PSDS) is a document that lists information relating to occupational safety and health for the use of various substances and products. SDSs are a widely used type of fact sheet used to catalogue information on chemical species including chemical compounds and chemical mixtures. SDS information may include instructions for the safe use and potential hazards associated with a particular material or product, along with spill-handling procedures. The older MSDS formats could vary from source to source within a country depending on national requirements; however, the newer SDS format is internationally standardized.

An SDS for a substance is not primarily intended for use by the general consumer, focusing instead on the hazards of working with the material in an occupational setting. There is also a duty to properly label substances on the basis of physico-chemical, health, or environmental risk. Labels often include hazard symbols such as the European Union standard symbols. The same product (e.g. paints sold under identical brand names by the same company) can have different formulations in different countries. The formulation and hazards of a product using a generic name may vary between manufacturers in the same country.

==Globally Harmonized System==

The Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals contains a standard specification for safety data sheets. The SDS follows a 16 section format which is internationally agreed and for substances especially, the SDS should be followed with an Annex which contains the exposure scenarios of this particular substance. The 16 sections are:
*SECTION 1: Identification of the substance/mixture and of the company/undertaking
**1.1. Product identifier
**1.2. Relevant identified uses of the substance or mixture and uses advised against
**1.3. Details of the supplier of the safety data sheet
**1.4. Emergency telephone number
*SECTION 2: Hazards identification 
**2.1. Classification of the substance or mixture
**2.2. Label elements
**2.3. Other hazards
*SECTION 3: Composition/information on ingredients 
**3.1. Substances
**3.2. Mixtures
*SECTION 4: First aid measures 
**4.1. Description of first aid measures
**4.2. Most important symptoms and effects, both acute and delayed
**4.3. Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed
*SECTION 5: Firefighting measures 
**5.1. Extinguishing media
**5.2. Special hazards arising from the substance or mixture
**5.3. Advice for firefighters
*SECTION 6: Accidental release measure 
**6.1. Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures
**6.2. Environmental precautions
**6.3. Methods and material for containment and cleaning up
**6.4. Reference to other sections

*SECTION 9: Physical and chemical properties
**9.1. Information on basic physical and chemical properties
**9.2. Other information
*SECTION 10: Stability and reactivity
**10.1. Reactivity
**10.2. Chemical stability
**10.3. Possibility of hazardous reactions
**10.4. Conditions to avoid
**10.5. Incompatible materials
**10.6. Hazardous decomposition products
*SECTION 11: Toxicological information

**14.7. Transport in bulk according to Annex II of MARPOL and the IBC Code
*SECTION 15: Regulatory information
**15.1. Safety, health and environmental regulations/legislation specific for the substance or mixture
**15.2. Chemical safety assessment
*SECTION 16: Other information
**16.2. Date of the latest revision of the SDS

==National and international requirements==

===Canada===

In Canada, the program known as the Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS) establishes the requirements for SDSs in workplaces and is administered federally by Health Canada under the Hazardous Products Act, Part II, and the Controlled Products Regulations.

===European Union===
Safety data sheets have been made an integral part of the system of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 (REACH). The original requirements of REACH for SDSs have been further adapted to take into account the rules for safety data sheets of the Global Harmonised System (GHS) and the implementation of other elements of the GHS into EU legislation that were introduced by Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 (CLP) via an update to Annex II of REACH.

The SDS must be supplied in an official language of the Member State(s) where the substance or mixture is placed on the market, unless the Member State(s) concerned provide(s) otherwise (Article 31(5) of REACH).

The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) has published a guidance document on the compilation of safety data sheets.

====Germany====
In Germany, safety data sheets must be compiled in accordance with REACH Regulation No. 1907/2006. The requirements concerning national aspects are defined in the Technical Rule for Hazardous Substances (TRGS) 220 &quot;National aspects when compiling safety data sheets&quot;. A national measure mentioned in SDS section 15 is as example the water hazard class (WGK) it is based on regulations governing systems for handling substances hazardous to waters (AwSV).

====The Netherlands====
Dutch Safety Data Sheets are well known as veiligheidsinformatieblad or Chemiekaarten. This is a collection of Safety Data Sheets of the most widely used chemicals. The Chemiekaarten boek is commercially available, but also made available through educational institutes, such as the web site offered by the University of Groningen.

=== South Africa ===
This section contributes to a better understanding of the regulations governing SDS within the South African framework. As regulations may change, it is the responsibility of the reader to verify the validity of the regulations mentioned in text.

As globalisation increased and countries engaged in cross-border trade, the quantity of hazardous material crossing international borders amplified. Realising the detrimental effects of hazardous trade, the United Nations established a committee of experts specialising in the transportation of hazardous goods. The committee provides best practises governing the conveyance of hazardous materials and goods for land including road and railway; air as well as sea transportation. These best practises are constantly updated to remain current and relevant.

There are various other international bodies who provide greater detail and guidance for specific modes of transportation such as the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) by means of the International Maritime Code and the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) via the Technical Instructions for the safe transport of dangerous goods by air as well as the International Air Transport Association (IATA) who provides regulations for the transport of dangerous goods.

These guidelines prescribed by the international authorities are applicable to the South African land, sea and air transportation of hazardous materials and goods. In addition to these rules and regulations to International best practice, South Africa has also implemented common laws which are laws based on custom and practise. Common laws are a vital part of maintaining public order and forms the basis of case laws. Case laws, using the principles of common law are interpretations and decisions of statutes made by courts. Acts of parliament are determinations and regulations by parliament which form the foundation of statutory law. Statutory laws are published in the government gazette or on the official website. Lastly, subordinate legislation are the bylaws issued by local authorities and authorised by parliament.

Statutory law gives effect to the Occupational Health and Safety Act of 1993 and the National Road Traffic Act of 1996. The Occupational Health and Safety Act details the necessary provisions for the safe handling and storage of hazardous materials and goods whilst the transport act details with the necessary provisions for the transportation of the hazardous goods.

Relevant South African legislation includes the Hazardous Chemicals Agent regulations of 2021 under the Occupational Health and Safety Act of 1993, the Chemical Substance Act 15 of 1973, and the National Road Traffic Act of 1996, and the Standards Act of 2008.

There has been selective incorporation of aspects of the Globally Harmonised System (GHS) of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals into South African legislation. At each point of the chemical value chain, there is a responsibility to manage chemicals in a safe and responsible manner. SDS is therefore required by law. A SDS is included in the requirements of Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1993 (Act No.85 of 1993) Regulation 1179 dated 25 August 1995.

The categories of information supplied in the SDS are listed in SANS 11014:2010; dangerous goods standards – Classification and information. SANS 11014:2010 supersedes the first edition SANS 11014-1:1994 and is an identical implementation of ISO 11014:2009. According to SANS 11014:2010:

===United Kingdom===
In the U.K., the Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations 2002 - known as CHIP Regulations - impose duties upon suppliers, and importers into the EU, of hazardous materials.

NOTE: Safety data sheets (SDS) are no longer covered by the CHIP regulations. The laws that require a SDS to be provided have been transferred to the European REACH Regulations.

The Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) Regulations govern the use of hazardous substances in the workplace in the UK and specifically require an assessment of the use of a substance. Regulation 12 requires that an employer provides employees with information, instruction and training for people exposed to hazardous substances. This duty would be very nearly impossible without the data sheet as a starting point. It is important for employers therefore to insist on receiving a data sheet from a supplier of a substance.

The duty to supply information is not confined to informing only business users of products. SDSs for retail products sold by large DIY shops are usually obtainable on those companies&#x27; web sites.

Web sites of manufacturers and large suppliers do not always include them even if the information is obtainable from retailers but written or telephone requests for paper copies will usually be responded to favourably.

===United Nations===
The United Nations (UN) defines certain details used in SDSs such as the UN numbers used to identify some hazardous materials in a standard form while in international transit.

===United States===
In the U.S., the Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires that SDSs be readily available to all employees for potentially harmful substances handled in the workplace under the Hazard Communication Standard. The SDS is also required to be made available to local fire departments and local and state emergency planning officials under Section 311 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. The American Chemical Society defines Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Numbers (CAS numbers) which provide a unique number for each chemical and are also used internationally in SDSs.

Reviews of material safety data sheets by the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board have detected dangerous deficiencies.
The board&#x27;s Combustible Dust Hazard Study analyzed 140 data sheets of substances capable of producing combustible dusts. None of the SDSs contained all the information the board said was needed to work with the material safely, and 41 percent failed to even mention that the substance was combustible.

As part of its study of an explosion and fire that destroyed the Barton Solvents facility in Valley Center, Kansas, in 2007, the safety board reviewed 62 material safety data sheets for commonly used nonconductive flammable liquids. As in the combustible dust study, the board found all the data sheets inadequate.

In 2012, the US adopted the 16 section Safety Data Sheet to replace Material Safety Data Sheets. This became effective on 1 December 2013. These new Safety Data Sheets comply with the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS). By 1 June 2015, employers were required to have their workplace labeling and hazard communication programs updated as necessary – including all MSDSs replaced with SDS-formatted documents.

==SDS authoring==
Many companies offer the service of collecting, or writing and revising, data sheets to ensure they are up to date and available for their subscribers or users. Some jurisdictions impose an explicit duty of care that each SDS be regularly updated, usually every three to five years. However, when new information becomes available, the SDS must be revised without delay. If a full SDS is not feasible, then a reduced workplace label should be authored.

<text>Cosmas Damian Asam (29 September 1686 – 10 May 1739) was a German painter and architect during the late Baroque period. Born in Benediktbeuern, he lived in Rome from 1711 to 1713 to study at the Accademia di San Luca with Carlo Maratta. In 1713, Asam won the Academy&#x27;s first prize for his drawing of &quot;Miracle of Saint Pio&quot;. In Germany, he worked with his brother Egid Quirin, a sculptor and stucco worker, on building and decorating entirely new churches (such as the Asam Church in Munich) or redesigning churches in the Baroque style (Regensburg—Benedictine Monastery Church of St. Emmeram). Their joint projects are often attributed to the &quot;Asam Brothers&quot;. Cosmas Damian died in Munich.

==Major works==

The Asam Brothers, singularly and together, were very prolific artists. They typically worked for Benedictine monasteries, though they occasionally took secular commissions. Cosmas Damian&#x27;s altar depicting The Vision of St. Benedict in Weltenburg—Monastery Church of St. George and St. Martin is thought to be the first realistic depiction of a solar eclipse in Western art history. Some of the major works of Cosmas Damian are the following.

<doc id="337362" wikidata="Q4921136" url="?curid=337362" title="Black Lake (Louisiana)">
<text>Black Lake is a reservoir located between Creston and Campti in North Louisiana. Water feeds into Black Lake from Black Lake Bayou, a watershed that extends from north of Gibsland in Bienville Parish and south to Clarence in Natchitoches Parish through the parishes of Claiborne, Webster, Bienville, Red River and Natchitoches. The elevation of the lake is . Louisiana Highway 9 runs across Black Lake. On the west side of Highway 9 the body of water is called Black Lake — the east is called Clear Lake or Clear Lake Bayou. The Clear Lake side is near another body of water: Saline Lake. Between Clear Lake and Saline Lake is the Alan Chiverly Dam, constructed in 1934. Road 1226 also extends between the lakes. The full area of the Black Lake is . Black Lake itself is shallow so in cold temperatures the fish head to Clear Lake and continue on towards Black Bayou as the weather gets colder so that in colder months the fish can be found only in deeper waters. Most of the crappie found at Black Lake are black crappie.

Residents about Black Lake use the Campti and Clarence ZIP Codes, 71411 and 71414, respectively. They are zoned to Lakeview Junior/Senior High School. There are boat launches and campgrounds for fishing and boating. Bell&#x27;s Camp, founded in 1936 by the late Albert and Eva Bell, is still operated by their daughter, Joy Bell Wimberly (born 1924). Nearby was a catfish and steak restaurant known as Sea and Sirloin, which opened in 1983.

==Landscape==
Black Lake is wide in some places such as at the Hwy 9 bridge and tight in other places because of the growth of cypress trees. There are channels cut into the lake that allow clearance for boats. Boats stay in the channels or risk grounding on tree stumps. The aquatic vegetation such as moss, seaweed and algae are visible at surface level.

==Geography==
The latitude and longitude coordinates for Black Lake are 31.9574, -93.0466 and the altitude is 102 feet (31 m).

== Notable Tournaments ==
Black Lake is home to the &quot;Branch Classic&quot; crappie fishing tournament. Anglers from Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi gather at Chandlers Camp annually during the final weekend of January to compete. The tournament utilizes over 10,000 &quot;yo-yo&quot; style fishing hooks. An average tournament will yield approximately 1,000-1,500 crappie and catfish. 15 time Branch Classic champion (Tanner Branch) is personally responsible for over 5,000 of the placed yo-yo style fishing hooks.

<text>The history of Melbourne details the city&#x27;s growth from a fledgling settlement into a modern commercial and financial centre as Australia&#x27;s second largest city, Melbourne, in the state of Victoria.

==Pre-European settlement==

The area around Port Phillip and the Yarra valley, on which the city of Melbourne now stands, was the home of the Kulin nation, an alliance of several language groups of Aboriginal Australians, whose ancestors had lived in the area for an estimated 31,000 to 40,000 years. At the time of European settlement the population of Indigenous inhabitants of what is now Victoria was estimated to be under 20,000, drawn from three peoples: the Wurundjeri, Boonwurrung (Bunurong) and Wathaurong.

The area was an important meeting place for the clans of the Kulin, as well as a vital source of food, water and a sheltered Bay Area for clan meetings and annual events. The Kulin lived by fishing, hunting and gathering, and made a good living from the rich food sources of Port Phillip and the surrounding grasslands.

Many of the Aboriginal people who live in Melbourne today are descended from Aboriginal groups from other parts of Victoria and Australia. However, there are still people who identify as Wurundjeri and Bunurong descendants of the original people who occupied the area of Melbourne prior to European settlement. While there are few overt signs of the Aboriginal past in the Melbourne area, there are a wealth of sites of cultural and spiritual significance.

In June 2021, the boundaries between the land of two of the traditional owner groups, the Wurundjeri and Bunurong, were agreed after being drawn up by the Victorian Aboriginal Heritage Council. The borderline runs across the city from west to east, with the CBD, Richmond and Hawthorn included in Wurundjeri land, and Albert Park, St Kilda and Caulfield on Bunurong land.

==Arrival of the penal colony==
In 1797 George Bass, in an open whaleboat with a crew of six, was the first European to enter what came to be called Bass Strait, the passage between the Australian mainland and Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (Tasmania). He sailed westwards along what is now the coast of the Gippsland region of Victoria, as far west as Western Port. In 1802, John Murray in the entered Port Phillip to conduct early mappings and exploration of the region, and he was followed shortly after by Matthew Flinders.

In 1803, Charles Grimes, the deputy surveyor-general of New South Wales, was sent to Port Phillip to survey the area. Sailing on , under the command of Acting Lieutenant Charles Robbins, the party entered Port Phillip on 20 January 1803. On 30 January, Grimes and his party landed at Frankston and met around thirty of the local inhabitants. A plaque at the site marks the event. On 2 February, he entered the mouth of the Yarra River. On the next day, Grimes rowed up the river in a boat and explored what is now the Maribyrnong River for several miles. Returning to the Yarra he explored the river for several miles until he reached Dights Falls on 8 February. The journal of another member of the party, James Flemming, has been preserved, and in it he several times refers to finding good soil. 
Although it was evidently a dry season Flemming, who was described by King as &quot;very intelligent&quot;, thought from the appearance of the herbage that &quot;there is not often so great a scarcity of water as at present&quot;. He suggested that the &quot;most eligible place for a settlement I have seen is on the Freshwater (Yarra) River&quot;. Grimes returned to Sydney on 7 March 1803 and, in spite of Flemming&#x27;s opinions, reported adversely against a settlement at Port Phillip.

Later in 1803 the British Governor of New South Wales, Captain Philip Gidley King, fearful that the French might try to occupy the Bass Strait area, sent Colonel David Collins with a party of 300 convicts to establish a settlement at Port Phillip. Collins arrived at the site of Sorrento, on the Mornington Peninsula, in October 1803, but was put off by the lack of fresh water. In May 1804 Collins moved the settlement to Tasmania, establishing Hobart. The northern shores of Bass Strait were then left to a few whalers and sealers. Among the convicts at Sorrento was a boy called John Pascoe Fawkner, who would later come back to settle in the Melbourne area.

In 1824 Hamilton Hume and William Hovell came overland from New South Wales, failing to find Western Port, their destination, but instead reaching Corio Bay, where they found good grazing land. But it was another ten years before Edward Henty, a Tasmanian grazier, established an illegal sheep-run on crown land at Portland, in what is now western Victoria, in 1834.

John Batman, a successful farmer in northern Tasmania, also desired more grazing land. He entered Port Phillip Bay on 29 May 1835, landing at Indented Head. Over the next week, he explored the area around the Bay, first at Corio Bay, near the present site of Geelong, and later moving up the Yarra and Maribyrnong rivers at the north of the Bay. He explored a large area in what is now the northern suburbs of Melbourne.

==Foundation of town==


On 6 June 1835, Batman, as part of a Tasmanian business syndicate known as the Port Phillip Association, signed a treaty with eight Wurundjeri elders in which he purported to buy of land around Melbourne and another around Geelong on Corio Bay to the south-west. On 8 June he wrote in his journal: &quot;So the boat went up the large river... and... I am glad to state about six miles up found the River all good water and very deep. This will be the place for a village.&quot; The last sentence later became famous as the &quot;founding charter&quot; of Melbourne.

Batman returned to Launceston in Tasmania (then known as Van Diemen&#x27;s Land) and began plans to mount a large expedition to establish a settlement on the Yarra. But John Fawkner, by now a businessman in Launceston, had the same idea. Fawkner bought a ship, the schooner &quot;Enterprize&quot;, which sailed on 4 August, with a party of intending settlers. When Batman&#x27;s party reached the Yarra on 2 September, they were dismayed and angry to find Fawkner&#x27;s people already in possession.

The two groups decided that there was plenty of land for everybody, and when Fawkner arrived on 16 October with another party of settlers, they agreed to parcel out land and not dispute who was there first. Both Batman and Fawkner settled in the new town.

Batman&#x27;s Treaty with the Aborigines was annulled by the New South Wales government (which at the time governed all of eastern mainland Australia) on 26 August 1835 (and the annulment confirmed by the Colonial Office on 10 October 1835), but provided for compensation to the Association. Although this meant the settlers were now trespassing on Crown land, the government reluctantly accepted the settlers&#x27; &quot;fait accompli&quot; and allowed the town to remain.

In September 1836, Governor Richard Bourke established the Port Phillip District of New South Wales, though the borders had still not been determined, with the settlement as its administrative centre. (Bourke was authorised by London to establish a settlement in April 1836.) Bourke also appointed Captain William Lonsdale as police magistrate, chief agent of the government and commandant of the district. Captain William Hobson (later Governor of New Zealand) was instructed to accompany Lonsdale, his family and public officers to Port Phillip. The presence of a warship together with the Governor&#x27;s agent indicated the Governor&#x27;s intention to re-take control of the situation in Port Phillip. Lonsdale arrived at Port Phillip with his wife Martha, 7-month-old daughter Alice and his one assigned servant, on board , commanded by Hobson. They anchored at the south end of the Bay on 27 September 1836, where Hobson despatched a cutter for survey work, and by the 29th had proceeded north and anchored off Point Gellibrand, Hobsons Bay, near the mouth of the Yarra River. Lonsdale landed unofficially, distributing the official proclamation of the establishment of the new settlement, and did the same the next day. On 1 October 1836 Lonsdale was formally rowed up the Yarra River and was met by John Batman and Dr Thompson and other assembled settlers.

Bourke also commissioned Robert Hoddle to make the first plan for the town, completed on 25 March 1837, which came to be known as the Hoddle Grid. The surveys were intended to prepare for land sales by public auction. Bourke visited Port Phillip in March 1837, confirmed Lonsdale&#x27;s choice of a site for the new town and named it Melbourne on 10 April 1837 after the then British prime minister William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, who resided in the village of Melbourne in Derbyshire. The General Post Office opened under that name on 13 April 1837.[16] Before being officially named, the town had several interim names – including Batmania, Bearbrass, Bareport, Bareheep, Barehurp and Bareberp. Public auctions for land began in June 1837. The compensation of the Port Phillip Association were only recognised to the extent of £7,000, allowed as a reduction on the purchase price of land bought by the association. Most of the members sold their entitlements to Charles Swanston.

George Gipps became Governor of New South Wales in 1838. In October 1839, he appointed Charles La Trobe as Superintendent of the district. He was a gifted man with artistic and scientific interests who did much to lay the foundations of Melbourne as a real city. La Trobe&#x27;s most lasting contribution to the city was to reserve large areas as public parks: today these are the Treasury Gardens, the Carlton Gardens, the Flagstaff Gardens, Royal Park and the Royal Botanic Gardens.

A Separation Association had been formed in 1840 wanting Port Phillip District to become a separate colony, and the first petition for the separation was drafted by Henry Fyshe Gisborne and presented by him to Governor Gipps. The entire population of Port Philip in 1841 was 11,738.

On 12 August 1842, Melbourne was incorporated as a &quot;town&quot; by Act 6 Victoria No. 7 of the Governor and Legislative Council of New South Wales. On 25 June 1847, the City of Melbourne was declared by letters patent of Queen Victoria.

In December 1842 Charles Dowling arrived in Melbourne and would soon be a merchant concentrating on &#x27;the settlers&#x27; trade&#x27;, providing merchandise for the squatters and buying their produce which he would ship to England. Richard Goldsbrough, a woolstapler, came to Melbourne in 1847. He bought a weatherboard building on the corner of William Street and Flinders Lane, and set up a business as a classer and packer of wool for sale in England. In 1850 he set up the first regular wool auction in Bourke Street.

In 1843 there was a panic which was attributed to an influx of British capital being used for land speculations, with the money being deposited in banks at interest, lent to squatters, and its sudden withdrawal for the purpose of remitting to London in payment for immigration and other demands. The panic was also caused by low wool prices and the cessation of transportation.

==Early colonisation and displacement==
Melbourne began as a collection of tents and huts on the banks of the Yarra River. The river was used for bathing and drinking water. The river had by the 1850s become quite polluted and was the cause of an epidemic of typhoid fever which hit the town resulting in many deaths. Though the Melbourne City Council opened the first Melbourne City Baths on 9 January 1860, people continued to swim and drink the river water.

Until the building boom which followed the gold rushes, most of Melbourne was built of timber, and almost nothing from this period survives. Two exceptions are St James Old Cathedral (1839) in Collins Street (now relocated to King Street opposite the Flagstaff Gardens), and St Francis Catholic Church (1841) in Elizabeth Street. Suburban development had already begun. The first sale of Crown lands in St Kilda took place on 7 December 1842, and the wealthy began building houses by the seashore, and a port developed at Williamstown. In 1844, a bridge was built to span the Yarra River at Swanston Street. The bridge replaced the privately operated punts. The bridge was a privately built wooden trestle toll bridge. In 1850, a government-built sandstone free bridge replaced the wooden bridge.

In 1848, Charles Perry became the first Anglican bishop for Melbourne, and James Alipius Goold became the Catholic Bishop of Melbourne.

With the arrival of Europeans in the area, the local indigenous people were hard hit by introduced diseases, and their decline was hastened by mistreatment, alcohol and venereal disease. There were also frontier conflicts such as the Battle of Yering in 1840, and the subsequent enforced removal of Aboriginal people from the Melbourne township during the Lettsom raid. Simon Wonga made moves to reclaim land for Kulin people to settle on in 1859, but they were not successful until 1863 when the surviving members of the Wurundjeri and other Woiwurrung speakers were given &#x27;permissive occupancy&#x27; of Coranderrk Station, near Healesville and forcibly resettled.

In July 1851 the successful agitation of the Port Phillip settlers led to the establishment of Victoria as a separate colony, and La Trobe became its first Lieutenant-Governor. In 1851 the white population of the whole Port Phillip District was still only 77,000, and only 23,000 people lived in Melbourne. Melbourne had already become a centre of Australia&#x27;s wool export trade.

A few months after separation, gold was discovered at several locations around the colony, most notably at Ballarat and Bendigo. The ensuing gold rush radically transformed Victoria, and particularly Melbourne. During land speculation of the 1850s many stone and brick public and financial buildings were built.

==1850s gold rush==

The discovery of gold led to a huge influx of people to Victoria, most of them arriving by sea at Melbourne. The town&#x27;s population doubled within a year. In 1852, 75,000 people arrived in the colony and this, combined with a very high birthrate, led to rapid population growth. The concurrent dispossession of the Aboriginal populations in those areas of inland Victoria which had not already been cleared for sheep runs was equally rapid.

In 1853 work began on the Yan Yean Reservoir to provide water for Melbourne. Piped water started to flow in 1857. Victoria&#x27;s population reached 400,000 in 1857 and 500,000 in 1860. As the easy gold ran out many of these people flooded into Melbourne or became a pool of unemployed in cities around Ballarat and Bendigo. There arose a huge wave of social unrest urging the opening of the lands in rural Victoria for small yeoman farming. In 1857 a Land Convention was held in Melbourne. Later a provisional government was formed by land hungry miners demanding land reform.

The accelerated population growth and the enormous wealth of the goldfields fuelled a boom which lasted for forty years, and ushered in the era known as &quot;marvellous Melbourne.&quot; The city spread eastwards and northwards over the surrounding flat grasslands, and southwards down the eastern shore of Port Phillip. Wealthy new suburbs like South Yarra, Toorak, Kew and Malvern grew up, while the working classes settled in Richmond, Collingwood and Fitzroy.

The influx of educated gold seekers from England led to rapid growth of schools, churches, learned societies, libraries and art galleries. Australia&#x27;s first telegraph line was erected between Melbourne and Williamstown in 1853. The first railway in Australia was built in Melbourne in 1854 between the city and Port Melbourne, then known as Sandridge. Also in 1854, the government offered four religious groups land on which to build schools. These included the Wesleyan Methodist Church, and the Anglican Church. These resulted in Wesley College and Melbourne Grammar School being built on St Kilda Road a few years later. The University of Melbourne was founded in 1855 and the State Library of Victoria in 1856. The foundation stone of St Patrick&#x27;s Catholic Cathedral was laid in 1858 and that of St Paul&#x27;s Anglican Cathedral in 1880. The Philosophical Institute of Victoria received a Royal Charter in 1859 and became the Royal Society of Victoria. In 1860 this Society assembled Victoria&#x27;s only organised attempt at inland exploration, the Burke and Wills expedition, with other exploration being more ad hoc.

A Melbourne Town Council had been created in 1847, and one by one other suburbs also gained town status, complete with town councils and mayors. In 1851 a party-elected Legislative Council, dominated by squatter interests, opposed the notion of universal suffrage and the role of the Legislative Assembly. In December 1854 discontent with the licensing system on the goldfields led to the rising at the Eureka Stockade, one of only two armed rebellions in Australian history (the other being the Castle Hill convict rebellion of 1804).

In November 1856, Victoria was given a constitution and in the following year full responsible government with a bicameral Parliament. For Melbourne, the major consequence was the magnificent edifice of Parliament House, Melbourne, which was started in December 1855 and extended to the present state between 1856 and 1929; it was not completed to the original design.

The boom fuelled by gold and wool lasted through the 1860s and &#x27;70s. Victoria suffered from an acute labour shortage despite its steady influx of migrants, and this pushed up wages until they were the highest in the world. Victoria was known as &quot;the working man&#x27;s paradise&quot; in these years. The Stonemasons Union won the eight-hour day in 1856 and celebrated by building the enormous Melbourne Trades Hall in Carlton.

==1880s and 1890s expansion==


Melbourne&#x27;s population reached 280,000 in 1880 and 445,000 in 1889. For a time it was the second-largest city in the British Empire, after London. During the boom, Melbourne had reputedly become the richest city in the world. In terms of area, Melbourne was already one of the largest cities in the world. Rather than building high-density apartment blocks like European cities, Melbourne expanded in all directions in the characteristic Australian suburban sprawl so Australians were afforded their Australian Dream of a &quot;quarter acre block&quot; in the suburbs, much like the American model.

The middle classes lived in detached villas on large blocks of land, while the working class lived in reasonably comfortable cottages in the northern and western suburbs, and older areas like Fitzroy and Collingwood became slums. Most of the new heavy industry was concentrated in the western suburbs. The wealthy built huge mansions beside the sea or in the picturesque Yarra Valley.

The new suburbs were serviced by networks of trains and trams which were among the largest and most modern in the world. Melbourne&#x27;s civic pride was demonstrated by the huge edifice of the Royal Exhibition Building, built in 1880 to house the Melbourne International Exhibition.

In the 1880s the long boom culminated in a frenzy of speculation and rapid inflation of land prices known as the Land Boom. Governments shared in the wealth and ploughed money into urban infrastructure, particularly railways. Huge fortunes were built on speculation, and Victorian business and politics became notorious for corruption. English banks lent freely to colonial speculators, adding to the mountain of debt on which the boom was built.

==1891 economic bust==
In 1891 the inevitable happened: a spectacular crash brought the boom to an abrupt end. Banks and other businesses failed in large numbers, thousands of shareholders lost their money, tens of thousands of workers were put out of work. Although there are no reliable statistics, there was probably 20 percent unemployment in Melbourne throughout the 1890s.

Melbourne had 490,000 people in 1890, and this figure scarcely changed for the next 15 years as a result of the crash and subsequent long slump. Immigration dried up, emigration to the goldfields of Western Australia and South Africa increased, and the high birthrate of the mid 19th century fell sharply and the city&#x27;s growth continued, but very slowly.

==&quot;Australia&#x27;s capital&quot;: 1901-1927==
Melbourne&#x27;s status as Australia&#x27;s largest city lasted long enough, however, for it to become the seat of government of the new Commonwealth of Australia when the six colonies federated in 1901. Parliament House in Spring St was lent to the Parliament of Australia, while Victoria&#x27;s Parliament found temporary accommodation in the Royal Exhibition Building.

The city&#x27;s growth stalled, and by 1905 Sydney had resumed its place as Australia&#x27;s largest city.

Economic growth slowly resumed from 1900, and Melbourne&#x27;s population reached 670,000 by 1914. But the boom years did not return, and the level of wages remained far lower than it had been in the 1880s. As a result, urban poverty became a feature of city life, and the slum areas of the inner suburbs spread.

Due to long delays in establishing a permanent capital at Canberra, Melbourne remained Australia&#x27;s capital until 1927, when the parliament finally moved to the &#x27;country capital&#x27;. Melbourne nevertheless remained the centre of the Commonwealth Public Service, the Australian Defence Forces, and as the location of the High Court of Australia for some time afterwards.

==Interwar period==
Melbourne&#x27;s mood was also darkened by the terrible sacrifices of World War I, in which 112,000 Victorians enlisted and 16,000 were killed. There were bitter political divisions during the war, with Melbourne&#x27;s Irish-born Catholic Archbishop Daniel Mannix leading opposition to conscription for the war and the Labor Party suffering a traumatic split. Another 4,000 Victorians died in the Spanish flu epidemic which followed the war. There was a modest revival of prosperity in the 1920s, and the population reached 1 million in 1930, but in 1929 the Wall Street crash ushered in the Great Depression, which lasted until a brief return to prosperity in the late 1930s, cut short by the outbreak of World War II.

In 1934 Melbourne celebrated its centenary and acquired another great landmark, the Shrine of Remembrance on St Kilda Road. The population stagnated again, and was still only 1.1 million in 1940.

==World War II==
During World War II, although Canberra was officially the capital, most of the military and civilian administration was centred in Melbourne, and the city&#x27;s economy benefited from wartime full employment and the influx of American service personnel (including General Douglas MacArthur, who briefly made his headquarters in Collins St before relocating to Brisbane).

==Post World War II==

After World War II, a new era of increasing prosperity arrived, fuelled by high prices for Victoria&#x27;s wool, increased government spending on transport and education, and the stimulus of renewed high immigration. Unlike prewar immigration, which had been mostly from the British Isles, the postwar program brought an influx of Europeans, at first mostly refugees from eastern and central Europe. A large proportion of these immigrants were Jews, and the Jewish population of Melbourne became the largest population proportionally of any Australian city, at about 1.4% in 1970. They were followed by migrants from Italy, Greece and the Netherlands.
Later, in the 1960s, migrants came from Yugoslavia, Turkey, Hungary and Lebanon. These inflows rapidly transformed the city&#x27;s demographic profile and many aspects of its life. This new growth required new spending on infrastructure such as roads, schools and hospitals, which had been neglected during the long decades of recession and low growth between 1890 and 1940. Henry Bolte, Premier from 1955 to 1972, was responsible for much of this rapid development of infrastructure. Under Bolte, some of the old inner-city slums were bulldozed and the dislocated tenants were housed in high-rise blocks of state-owned apartments.

Since the 1970s, the pace of change in Melbourne has been increasingly rapid. The end of the White Australia Policy brought the first significant Asian migration to Melbourne since the gold rushes, with large numbers of people from Vietnam, Cambodia and China arriving. For the first time, Melbourne acquired a large Muslim population, and the official policy of multiculturalism encouraged Melbourne&#x27;s various ethnic and religious minorities to maintain and celebrate their identities. At the same time, the practice of mainstream Christianity largely declined, leading to a secularisation of public life.

State patronage of the arts led to a boom in festivals, theatre, music and the visual arts. Tourism became a major industry, bringing still more foreign faces to Melbourne&#x27;s streets. In 1956, the city became the first in the Southern Hemisphere to host the Olympic Games. Two new universities opened, Monash University in 1961 and La Trobe University in 1967, followed by others in the 1980s, maintaining Melbourne&#x27;s place as a leader in tertiary education.

===1980s–1990s===

Increasing urban sprawl spread from Werribee in the south-west to Healesville in the north-east and encompassing much of the Mornington Peninsula and Dandenong Ranges to the south and east. A program of freeway construction was fast tracked in the 1970s and 1980s, while the expansion of rail and tram networks were neglected, aside from the opening of the City Loop in 1981. These factors led to the rapid growth of the number and use of private cars.

===1989 financial crash===
High interest rates and poor governance contributed to a financial crash in 1989. The collapse of merchant bank Tricontinental, Pyramid Building Society, businesses, property values and the forced sale of State Bank of Victoria led to a deep recession. Melbourne&#x27;s population growth slowed during the early 1990s as employment contracted, with a rise in migration to other states such as Queensland.

In turn this recession contributed to the fall of Joan Kirner&#x27;s Labor government and the election in 1992 of a radical free-market Liberal government under Jeff Kennett. Kennett&#x27;s team restored Victoria&#x27;s finances by making sweeping cuts to public expenditure, closing many schools, privatising the tramways and electricity infrastructure, reducing the size of the public service, and local government restructuring. These reforms came at a high social cost, but ultimately restored confidence in Melbourne&#x27;s economy and led to a resumption of growth. In 1999 Kennett was voted out of office, but key landmarks that his government commissioned, such as the Melbourne Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre and the new Melbourne Museum, remain, and many of his reforms have been maintained.

Partly as a result of the increasing difficulty of travelling across the city, the central business centre declined, and satellite suburbs such as Frankston, Dandenong and Ringwood, and further out Melton, Sunbury and Werribee, became centres of manufacturing, retailing and administration. As a result, industrial employment in the old working class inner suburbs declined, with these areas rapidly gentrifying in the 1990s and 2000s.

By the end of the 20th century Melbourne had a population of 3.8 million people.

==2000s==

In the early years of the 21st century, Melbourne entered a new period of high economic and population growth under the more cautious Labor government of Steve Bracks, which restored public expenditure on health and education. As the city&#x27;s suburbs continued to sprawl outwards, the Bracks government sought to restrict new suburban growth to designated growth corridors and encourage higher-density apartment living in the city&#x27;s main transport hubs.

The city&#x27;s Central Business District experienced a major resurgence in the 2000s, aided by a large increase in inner-city apartment living, the opening of new public spaces such as Federation Square and the new Southern Cross railway station, a determined marketing campaign by Lord Mayor John So&#x27;s City Council and continuing development of the Southbank and Docklands precincts.

Since the late 2000s, population growth in Melbourne has been accelerating. Since the early 20th century, the city has been expanding outwards with low-density suburban urban forms to accommodate population growth.
In 2009 the Victorian Government announced plans to extend the city&#x27;s urban growth boundary, potentially rezoning green wedges and agricultural land for housing development.

Since 1997, Melbourne has maintained significant population and employment growth. There has been substantial international investment in the city&#x27;s industries and property market. Major inner-city urban renewal has occurred in areas such as Southbank, Port Melbourne, Docklands and South Wharf. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Melbourne sustained the highest population increase and economic growth rate of any Australian capital city in the three years ended June 2004.

Despite lack of a progressive economy, general lack of government funding for public services such as public transport, and continued unsustainable urban growth, the city has seen sustained growth in its cultural institutions such as art, music, literature, performance, etc., as many contributors to and patrons of the arts relocate to Melbourne amongst excellent independent community support structures such as press and radio and a thriving cultural community. In 2003, Melbourne was named as a UNESCO City of Literature and the city hosts the majority of Australia&#x27;s contemporary festivals, events and institutions, new galleries, music venues, museums, of all shapes and sizes are opening across the city.

From 2006, the growth of the city extended into &quot;green wedges&quot; and beyond the city&#x27;s Urban growth boundary. Predictions of the city&#x27;s population reaching 5 million people pushed the state government to review the growth boundary in 2008 as part of its Melbourne @ Five Million strategy. Melbourne survived the 2007–2008 financial crisis better than any other Australian city. In 2009, more new jobs were created in Melbourne than any other Australian capital – almost as many as the next two fastest growing cities, Brisbane and Perth, combined. and Melbourne&#x27;s property market remained strong, resulting in historically high property prices and widespread rent increases.

==2010s–2020s==

Beginning in 2014 the State Government of Daniel Andrews initiated a number of major infrastructure projects designed to reduce congestion in Melbourne, improve public transport and encourage economic growth, including the Metro Tunnel, the West Gate Tunnel, the North East Link, and the Suburban Rail Loop. The Level Crossing Removal Project, a State Government program of works to remove 110 level crossings, reshaped suburbs across Melbourne by removing rail crossings, rebuilding stations and sometimes allowing for urban renewal. Other major infrastructure initiatives included the Victorian School Building Authority and the rebuilding of Footscray Hospital. Planning for a Melbourne Airport rail link was initiated in 2018 but paused in 2023 due to escalating costs.

Melbourne was voted the world&#x27;s most liveable city for seven consecutive years from 2011 to 2017 by the Economist Intelligence Unit.

New urban renewal zones were opened up in inner-city areas like Fisherman&#x27;s Bend and Arden, while suburban growth continued on the urban periphery in Melbourne&#x27;s outer west and east in suburbs like Wyndham Vale and Cranbourne. Middle suburbs like Box Hill became denser as a greater proportion of Melburnians began living in apartments. A construction boom resulted in 34 new skyscrapers being built in the central business district between 2010 and 2020. In 2020, Melbourne was classified as an Alpha city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.The COVID-19 pandemic recorded its first Australian case in Melbourne on 25 January 2020. Out of all major Australian cities, Melbourne was the worst affected by the pandemic and spent a long time under lockdown restrictions, with Melbourne experiencing six lockdowns totalling 262 days. The public health policies led to anti-lockdown protests and civil unrest in 2021. While this contributed to a net outflow of migration causing a slight reduction in Melbourne&#x27;s population over the course of 2020 to 2022, Melbourne is projected to be the fastest growing capital city in Australia from 2023–24 onwards, overtaking Sydney as the nation&#x27;s largest city in 2029–30 at just over 5.9 million, exceeding 6 million people the following year.

<text>XCOFF, for &quot;eXtended COFF&quot;, defined by IBM and used in AIX, is an improved and expanded version of the COFF object file format. Early versions of the PowerPC Macintosh also supported XCOFF, as did BeOS.

XCOFF additions include the use of [[IBM Basic assembly language#Machine instructions (mnemonic)|CSECTs]] to provide subsection granularity of cross-references, and the use of stabs for debugging. Information for the handling of shared libraries is also more elaborate than for plain COFF.

More recently, IBM defined an XCOFF64 version supporting 64-bit AIX, and used XCOFF32 to mean the original file format.
