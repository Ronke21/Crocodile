<text>The diaphragm is a barrier method of birth control. It is moderately effective, with a one-year failure rate of around 12% with typical use. It is placed over the cervix with spermicide before sex and left in place for at least six hours after sex. Fitting by a healthcare provider is generally required.
Side effects are usually very few. Use may increase the risk of bacterial vaginosis and urinary tract infections. If left in the vagina for more than 24 hours toxic shock syndrome may occur. While use may decrease the risk of sexually transmitted infections, it is not very effective at doing so. There are a number of types of diaphragms with different rim and spring designs. They may be made from latex, silicone, or natural rubber. They work by blocking access to and holding spermicide near the cervix.
The diaphragm came into use around 1882. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

==Medical use==
Before inserting or removing a diaphragm, one&#x27;s hands should be washed to avoid introducing harmful bacteria into the vaginal canal.

The rim of a diaphragm is squeezed into an oval or arc shape for insertion. A water-based lubricant (usually spermicide) may be applied to the rim of the diaphragm to aid insertion. One teaspoon (5 mL) of spermicide may be placed in the dome of the diaphragm before insertion, or with an applicator after insertion.

The diaphragm must be inserted sometime before sexual intercourse, and remain in the vagina for 6 to 8 hours after a man&#x27;s last ejaculation. For multiple acts of intercourse, it is recommended that an additional 5 mL of spermicide be inserted into the vagina (not into the dome—the seal of the diaphragm should not be broken) before each act. Upon removal, a diaphragm should be cleansed with mild soap and warm water before storage. The diaphragm must be removed for cleaning at least once every 24 hours and can be re-inserted immediately.

Oil-based products should not be used with latex diaphragms. Lubricants or vaginal medications that contain oil will cause the latex to rapidly degrade and greatly increases the chances of the diaphragm breaking or tearing.

Natural latex rubber will degrade over time. Depending on usage and storage conditions, a latex diaphragm should be replaced every one to three years. Silicone diaphragms may last much longer—up to ten years.

===Effectiveness===
The effectiveness of diaphragms, as of most forms of contraception, can be assessed two ways: &quot;method effectiveness&quot; and &quot;actual effectiveness&quot;. The method effectiveness is the proportion of couples correctly and consistently using the method who do not become pregnant. Actual effectiveness is the proportion of couples who intended that method as their sole form of birth control and do not become pregnant; it includes couples who sometimes use the method incorrectly, or sometimes not at all. Rates are generally presented for the first year of use. Most commonly the Pearl Index is used to calculate effectiveness rates, but some studies use decrement tables.

For all forms of contraception, actual effectiveness is lower than method effectiveness, due to several factors:

* mistakes on the part of those providing instructions on how to use the method
* mistakes on the part of the method&#x27;s users
* conscious user non-compliance with method

For instance, someone using a diaphragm might be fitted incorrectly by a health care provider, or by mistake remove the diaphragm too soon after intercourse, or simply choose to have intercourse without placing the diaphragm.

&quot;Contraceptive Technology&quot; reports that the method failure rate of the diaphragm with spermicide is 6% per year.

The actual pregnancy rates among diaphragm users vary depending on the population being studied, with yearly rates of 10% to 39% being reported.

Unlike some other cervical barriers, the effectiveness of the diaphragm is the same for women who have given birth as for those who have not.

===Advantages===
The diaphragm does not interfere with a woman&#x27;s menstrual cycle, therefore, no reversal or waiting time is necessary if contraception is no longer wanted or needed.

The diaphragm only has to be used during intercourse. Many women, especially those who have sex less frequently, prefer barrier contraception such as the diaphragm over methods that require some action every day.

Like all cervical barriers, diaphragms may be inserted several hours before use, allowing uninterrupted foreplay and intercourse. Most couples find that neither partner can feel the diaphragm during intercourse.

The diaphragm is less expensive than many other methods of contraception.

===Sexually transmitted infections===
There is some evidence that the cells in the cervix are particularly susceptible to certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Cervical barriers such as diaphragms may offer some protection against these infections. However, research conducted to test whether the diaphragm offers protection from HIV found that women provided with both male condoms and a diaphragm experienced the same rate of HIV infection as women provided with male condoms alone.

Because pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is caused by certain STIs, diaphragms may lower the risk of PID. Cervical barriers may also protect against human papillomavirus (HPV), the virus that causes cervical cancer, although the protection appears to be due to the spermicide used with diaphragms and not the barrier itself.

Diaphragms are also considered a good candidate as a delivery method for microbicides (preparations that, used vaginally, protect against STIs) that are currently in development.

==Side effects==
Women (or their partners) who are allergic to latex should not use a latex diaphragm.

Diaphragms are associated with an increased risk of urinary tract infection (UTI) Urinating before inserting the diaphragm, and also after intercourse, may reduce this risk.

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) occurs at a rate of 2.4 cases per 100,000 women using diaphragms, almost exclusively when the device is left in place longer than 24 hours.

The increase in risk of UTIs may be due to the diaphragm applying pressure to the urethra, especially if the diaphragm is too large, and causing irritation and preventing the bladder from emptying fully. However, the spermicide nonoxynol-9 is itself associated with increased risk of UTI, yeast infection, and bacterial vaginosis. For this reason, some advocate use of lactic acid or lemon juice based spermicides, which might have fewer side effects.

In the early 1920s, Marie Stopes claimed that when wearing a diaphragm, the vagina is stretched such that certain movements made by the woman for the benefit of the man were restricted by the diaphragm spring. In later years there was some discussion of this, with two authors supporting this concept and one opposed. One of them argued in the later 1920s-1930s that while the muscle movement by women is restricted it does not make all that much difference since most &quot;women (in the 1920s) are not able to operate their pelvic muscles voluntarily to the best advantage&quot; (during sex). However, Stopes anticipated this rebuttal, and in so many words classified it as a lame excuse.

== Use without spermicide ==
It has been suggested that, for women who experience side effects from the spermicide nonoxynol-9, it may be acceptable to use the diaphragm without any spermicide. One study found an actual pregnancy rate of 24% per year in women using the diaphragm without spermicide; however, all women in this study were given a 60 mm diaphragm rather than being fitted by a clinician. Other studies have been small and given conflicting results. Insufficient studies have been conducted to conclusively determine effectiveness without spermicide. The current recommendation is still for all diaphragm users to use spermicide with the device. 

==Types==
Diaphragms are available in diameters of 50 mm to 105mm (about 2–4 inches). They are available in two different materials: latex and silicone. Diaphragms are also available with different types of springs in the rim.

An &quot;arcing spring&quot; folds into an arc shape when the sides are compressed. This is the strongest type of rim available in a diaphragm, and may be used by women with any level of vaginal tone. Unlike other spring types, arcing springs may be used by women with mild cystocele, rectocele, or retroversion. Arcing spring diaphragms may be easier to insert correctly than other spring types.

A &quot;coil spring&quot; flattens into an oval shape when the sides are compressed. This rim is not as strong as the arcing spring, and may only be used by women with average or firm vaginal tone. If an arcing spring diaphragm is uncomfortable for a woman or, during intercourse, her partner, a coil spring may prove more satisfactory. Unlike the arcing spring diaphragms, coil springs may be inserted with a device called an introducer.

A &quot;flat spring&quot; is much like a coil spring, but thinner. This type of rim may only be used by women with firm vaginal tone. Flat spring diaphragms may also be inserted with an introducer for women uncomfortable using their hands. Ortho used to manufacture a flat-spring diaphragm called the Ortho White. Reflexions also manufactured a flat-spring diaphragm up until 2014.

There are a number of variations. The SILCS diaphragm is made of silicone, has an arcing spring, and a finger cup is molded on one end for easy removal. The Duet disposable diaphragm is made of dipped polyurethane, pre-filled with BufferGel (BufferGel is currently in clinical trials as a spermicide and microbicide). Both the SILCS and Duet diaphragms come in only one size.

===Fitting===

Diaphragms usually come in different sizes and require a fitting appointment with a health care professional to determine which size a woman should wear. Single size diaphragms that do not require fitting also exist.

A correctly fitting diaphragm will cover the cervix and rest snugly against the pubic bone. A diaphragm that is too small might fit inside the vagina without covering the cervix, or might become dislodged from the cervix during intercourse or bowel movements. It is also more likely that a woman&#x27;s partner will feel the anterior rim of a diaphragm that is too small during intercourse. A diaphragm that is too large will place pressure on the urethra, preventing the bladder from emptying completely and increasing the risk of urinary tract infection. A diaphragm that is too large may also cause a sore to develop on the vaginal wall.

Diaphragms should be re-fitted after a weight change of 4.5 kg (10 lb) or more. The traditional clinical guideline is that a decrease in weight may cause a woman to need a larger size, although the strength of this relationship has been questioned.

Diaphragms should also be re-fitted after any pregnancy of 14 weeks or longer. Full-term vaginal delivery especially will tend to increase the size diaphragm a woman needs, although the changes to the pelvic floor during pregnancy mean even women who experience second-trimester miscarriage, or deliver by C-section, should be refitted.

&quot;Vaginal tenting&quot;, an increase in the length of the vagina, occurs during arousal. This means that during intercourse, the diaphragm will not fit snugly against the pubic bone because it is carried higher up the vaginal canal by the movement of the cervix. If the diaphragm is inserted after arousal has begun, extra care must be taken to ensure the device is covering the cervix.

A woman might be fitted with a different size diaphragm depending on where she is in her menstrual cycle. It is common for a woman to wear a larger diaphragm during menstruation. It has been speculated that a woman may be fitted with a larger size diaphragm when she is near ovulation. The correct size for a woman is the largest size that she can wear comfortably throughout her cycle.

In the United States, diaphragms are available by prescription only. Many other countries do not require prescriptions.

==Mechanism of action==
The spring in the rim of the diaphragm forms a seal against the vaginal walls. The diaphragm covers the cervix, and physically prevents sperm from entering the uterus through the os.

Traditionally, the diaphragm has been used with spermicide, and it is widely believed that the spermicide is a significant factor in the effectiveness of the diaphragm. However, some have asserted that the diaphragm&#x27;s mechanism of action is primarily as a physical barrier and that a diaphragm is effective without spermicides, but insufficient studies have been conducted to prove this.

It is widely taught that additional spermicide must be placed in the vagina if intercourse occurs more than six hours after insertion. However, there has been very little research on how long spermicide remains active within the diaphragm. One study found that spermicidal jelly and creme used in a diaphragm retained its full spermicidal activity for twelve hours after placement of the diaphragm.

It has long been recommended that the diaphragm be left in place for at least six or eight hours after intercourse. No studies have been done to determine the validity of this recommendation, however, and some medical professionals have suggested intervals of four hours or even two hours are sufficient to ensure efficacy. One manufacturer of contraceptive sponges recommends leaving the sponge in place for only two hours after intercourse. However, such use of the diaphragm (removal before 6 hours post-intercourse) has never been formally studied, and cannot be recommended.

It has been suggested that diaphragms be dispensed as a one-size-fits-all device, providing all women with the most common size (70 mm). However, only 33% of women fitted for a diaphragm are prescribed a 70 mm size, and correct sizing of the diaphragm is widely considered necessary.

==History==
The idea of blocking the cervix to prevent pregnancy is thousands of years old. Various cultures have used cervix-shaped devices such as oiled paper cones or lemon halves, or have made sticky mixtures that include honey or cedar resin to be applied to the cervical opening. However, the diaphragm—which stays in place because of the spring in its rim, rather than hooking over the cervix or being sticky—is of more recent origin.

An important precursor to the invention of the diaphragm was the rubber vulcanization process, patented by Charles Goodyear in 1844. In the 1880s, a German gynecologist, Wilhelm P. J. Mensinga, published the first description of a rubber contraceptive device with a spring molded into the rim. Mensinga wrote first under the pseudonym C. Hasse, and the Mensinga diaphragm was the only brand available for many decades. In the United States, the physician Edward Bliss Foote designed and sold an early form of occlusive pessary under the name &quot;womb veil&quot; starting in the 1860s.

American birth control activist Margaret Sanger fled to Europe in 1914 to escape prosecution under the Comstock laws, which prohibited sending contraceptive devices, or information about contraception, through the mail. Sanger learned about the diaphragm in the Netherlands and introduced the product to the United States when she returned in 1916. Sanger and her second husband, Noah Slee, illegally imported large quantities of the devices from Germany and the Netherlands. In 1925, Slee provided funding to Sanger&#x27;s friend Herbert Simonds, who used the funds to found the first diaphragm manufacturing company in the U.S., the Holland-Rantos Company.

Diaphragms played a role in overturning the federal Comstock Act of 1873. In 1932, Sanger arranged for a Japanese manufacturer to mail a package of diaphragms to a New York physician who supported Sanger&#x27;s activism. U.S. Customs confiscated the package and Sanger helped file a lawsuit. In 1936, in the court case &quot;United States v. One Package of Japanese Pessaries&quot;, a federal appellate court ruled that the package could be delivered.

Although in Europe, the cervical cap was more popular than the diaphragm, the diaphragm became one of the most widely used contraceptives in the United States. In 1940, one-third of all U.S. married couples used a diaphragm for contraception. The number of women using diaphragms dropped dramatically after the 1960s introduction of the intrauterine device and the combined oral contraceptive pill. In 1965, only 10% of U.S. married couples used a diaphragm for contraception. That number has continued to fall, and in 2002 only 0.2% of American women were using a diaphragm as their primary method of contraception.

In 2014 Janssen Pharmaceuticals announced the discontinuation of the Ortho-All Flex Diaphragm, making it very difficult for women in the U.S. to have that option as a birth-control method.

The single-sized, silicone diaphragm was developed by PATH during the late 2000s. It was licensed to Kessel Marketing &amp; Vertriebs GmbH of Frankfurt, Germany, which began to market it as the Caya Diaphragm. The diaphragm was approved for contraception in Europe in 2013 and in the United States the following year. Since then, Kessel has also developed a traditionally circular, multi-sized diaphragm made from the same materials that they released in Germany in 2020 under the name Singa.

== Society and culture ==
=== Economics ===
In the United Kingdom, they cost the National Health Service less than £10 each. In the United States, they cost about US$15 to $75 and are the birth control method of 0.3% of women. These costs do not include that of spermicide.

<doc id="338190" wikidata="Q1105305" url="?curid=338190" title="Cockfosters tube station">
<text>Cockfosters () is a London Underground station. It is located on Cockfosters Road (A111) approximately nine miles () from central London and serves Cockfosters. It is on the boundary of the London Borough of Barnet and the London Borough of Enfield. It is the northern terminus of the Piccadilly line and the next station towards south is Oakwood. The station is in Travelcard Zone 5.

==History==
The station opened on 31 July 1933, the last of the stations on the extension of the line from Finsbury Park to do so and four months after Oakwood station (then called Enfield West) opened. Prior to its opening, &quot;Trent Park&quot; and &quot;Cock Fosters&quot; (an early spelling of the area&#x27;s name) were suggested as alternative station names. The original site hoarding displayed the name as a single word.

The station was designed by Charles Holden in a modern European style using brick, glass and reinforced concrete. Compared with the other new stations Holden designed for the extension, Cockfosters&#x27; street buildings are modest in scale, lacking the mass of Oakwood or Arnos Grove or the avant-garde flourish of Southgate. Holden&#x27;s early design sketches show the station with two towers. The most striking feature of the station is the tall concrete and glass trainshed roof and platform canopies, which are supported by portal frames of narrow blade-like concrete columns and beams rising from the platforms and spanning across the tracks. The trainshed roof constructed at Uxbridge from 1937 to 1938 was built to a similar design. Cockfosters station is a Grade II listed building.

The station has three tracks with platforms numbered 1 to 4, the centre track being served from both sides by platforms 2 and 3. This is an example of the so-called Spanish solution. Most eastbound Piccadilly trains terminate here, although some terminate at Arnos Grove or Oakwood, particularly in peak hours or in the evenings. Some trains may even terminate at Wood Green; however, this is only used very early in the morning or in emergency situations. Cockfosters depot is located between Oakwood and Cockfosters and trains can enter or leave it from either direction.

In September 2020, works to provide step-free access were completed with a lift providing access to the platform, making Cockfosters the 80th accessible Tube station.

== Future property development ==
In the late 2010s, the station car park at Cockfosters was proposed by Transport for London&#x27;s property arm Places for London for property development, as part of TfL&#x27;s plans to increase the amount of income generated from land in their ownership. By September 2020, it was proposed that over 350 new homes (with 40% affordable homes) would be built on the current car park at the station by TfL and Grainger. The plans also included new public space, cycle parking and dedicated disabled car parking spaces. The proposal was criticised due to the loss of Tube car parking and the amount of new homes proposed on the site. 

Despite approval from the local council, the development was blocked by Conservative Transport Secretary Grant Shapps in 2022, following campaigning by local residents and MP Theresa Villiers. In September 2024, Labour Transport Secretary Louise Haigh approved the development.

Cockfosters tube station features prominently in the novel &quot;While England Sleeps&quot; by American author David Leavitt. One of the novel&#x27;s protagonists is writing a book entitled &quot;The Train to Cockfosters&quot;.

A commercial for Foster&#x27;s lager shown on UK television in the 1980s features Paul Hogan sitting in an Underground station near to a Japanese man who is looking at the Tube map on the wall. The man asks Hogan, &quot;Can you tell me the way to Cockfosters?&quot;, to which Hogan replies, &quot;Drink it warm, mate&quot;.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 298, 299, 384, school routes 692, 699 and night bus N91 serve the station.

<text>FLOX is a flameless combustion process developed by &quot;WS Wärmeprozesstechnik GmbH&quot;.

== History ==
In experiments with industrial gasoline engines conducted in April 1990, Joachim Alfred Wünning found that when combustion occurred at a temperature greater than 850 °C, the flames were blown away. Although this observation was initially thought to be an error, it turned out to be a discovery which led to the invention of what he called FLOX-Technology, a name derived from the German expression &quot;flammenlose Oxidation&quot; (flameless oxidation). The advantages of this technology attracted funding for a project at Stuttgart University called FloxCoal, a programme aiming to engineer a flameless atomizing coal burner. The reduced pollutant emission in FLOX combustion has been considered a promising candidate for use in coal pollution mitigation and the higher efficiency combustion in FLOX received increased interest as a result of the 1990 oil price shock. FLOX burners have since been used within furnaces in the steel and metallurgical industries.

== Technology ==
FLOX requires the air and fuel components to be mixed in an environment in which exhaust gases are recirculated back into the combustion chamber. Flameless combustion also does not display the same high energy peaks as the traditional combustion observed within a swirl burner, resulting in a more smooth and stable combustion process.

When combustion occurs, NOx is formed at the front of the flame: suppression of peak flame offers the theoretical possibility of reducing NOx production to zero. Experiments with FLOX-Technology have established that it can reduce the amount of NOx generated by 20% in the case of Rhenisch brown coal, and by 65% in the case of Polish black coal. 

The role of combustion temperature in NOx formation has been understood for some time. Reduction of the combustion temperature in gasoline engines, by reducing the compression ratio, was among the first steps taken to comply with the U.S. clean air act in the 1970s. This lowered the NOx emissions by lowering the temperature at the flame front.

<doc id="338192" wikidata="Q2754887" url="?curid=338192" title="Common-ion effect">
<text>In chemistry, the common-ion effect refers to the decrease in solubility of an ionic precipitate by the addition to the solution of a soluble compound with an ion in common with the precipitate. This behaviour is a consequence of Le Chatelier&#x27;s principle for the equilibrium reaction of the ionic association/dissociation. The effect is commonly seen as an effect on the solubility of salts and other weak electrolytes. Adding an additional amount of one of the ions of the salt generally leads to increased precipitation of the salt, which reduces the concentration of both ions of the salt until the solubility equilibrium is reached. The effect is based on the fact that both the original salt and the other added chemical have one ion in common with each other.

== Examples of the common-ion effect ==

===Dissociation of hydrogen sulfide in presence of hydrochloric acid===

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a weak electrolyte. It is partially ionized when in aqueous solution, therefore there exists an equilibrium between un-ionized molecules and constituent ions in an aqueous medium as follows:

:H2S H+ + HS−

By applying the law of mass action, we have

:formula_1

Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a strong electrolyte, which nearly completely ionizes as

:HCl → H+ + Cl−

If HCl is added to the H2S solution, H+ is a common ion and creates a common ion effect. Due to the increase in concentration of H+ ions from the added HCl, the equilibrium of the dissociation of H2S shifts to the left and keeps the value of Ka constant. Thus the dissociation of H2S decreases, the concentration of un-ionized H2S increases, and as a result, the concentration of sulfide ions decreases.

===Solubility of barium iodate in presence of barium nitrate===
Barium iodate, Ba(IO3)2, has a solubility product Ksp = [Ba2+][IO3−]2 = 1.57 x 10−9. Its solubility in pure water is 7.32 x 10−4 M. However in a solution that is 0.0200 M in barium nitrate, Ba(NO3)2, the increase in the common ion barium leads to a decrease in iodate ion concentration. The solubility is therefore reduced to 1.40 x 10−4 M, about five times smaller.

==Solubility effects==

A practical example used very widely in areas drawing drinking water from chalk or limestone aquifers is the addition of sodium carbonate to the raw water to reduce the hardness of the water. In the water treatment process, highly soluble sodium carbonate salt is added to precipitate out sparingly soluble calcium carbonate. The very pure and finely divided precipitate of calcium carbonate that is generated is a valuable by-product used in the manufacture of toothpaste.

The salting-out process used in the manufacture of soaps benefits from the common-ion effect. Soaps are sodium salts of fatty acids. Addition of sodium chloride reduces the solubility of the soap salts. The soaps precipitate due to a combination of common-ion effect and increased ionic strength.

Sea, brackish and other waters that contain appreciable amount of sodium ions (Na+) interfere with the normal behavior of soap because of common-ion effect. In the presence of excess Na+, the solubility of soap salts is reduced, making the soap less effective.

== Buffering effect==

A buffer solution contains an acid and its conjugate base or a base and its conjugate acid. Addition of the conjugate ion will result in a change of pH of the buffer solution. For example, if both sodium acetate and acetic acid are dissolved in the same solution they both dissociate and ionize to produce acetate ions. Sodium acetate is a strong electrolyte, so it dissociates completely in solution. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it only ionizes slightly. According to Le Chatelier&#x27;s principle, the addition of acetate ions from sodium acetate will suppress the ionization of acetic acid and shift its equilibrium to the left. Thus the percent dissociation of the acetic acid will decrease, and the pH of the solution will increase. The ionization of an acid or a base is limited by the presence of its conjugate base or acid.

: NaCH3CO2(s) → Na+(aq) + CH3CO2−(aq)

: CH3CO2H(aq) H+(aq) + CH3CO2−(aq)

This will decrease the hydronium concentration, and thus the common-ion solution will be less acidic than a solution containing only acetic acid.

==Exceptions==
Many transition-metal compounds violate this rule due to the formation of complex ions, a scenario not part of the equilibria that are involved in simple precipitation of salts from ionic solution. For example, copper(I) chloride is insoluble in water, but it dissolves when chloride ions are added, such as when hydrochloric acid is added. This is due to the formation of soluble CuCl2− complex ions.

== Uncommon-ion effect ==
Sometimes adding an ion other than the ones that are part of the precipitated salt itself can increase the solubility of the salt. This &quot;salting in&quot; is called the &quot;uncommon-ion effect&quot; (also &quot;salt effect&quot; or the &quot;diverse-ion effect&quot;). It occurs because as the total ion concentration increases, inter-ion attraction within the solution can become an important factor. This alternate equilibrium makes the ions less available for the precipitation reaction. This is also called odd ion effect.

<doc id="338197" wikidata="Q6384276" url="?curid=338197" title="Keith Douglas">
<text>Keith Castellain Douglas (24 January 1920 – 9 June 1944) was a poet and soldier noted for his war poetry during the Second World War and his wry memoir of the Western Desert campaign, &quot;Alamein to Zem Zem&quot;. He was killed in action during the invasion of Normandy.

==Poetry==
Douglas described his poetic style as &quot;extrospective&quot;; that is, he focused on external impressions rather than inner emotions or feelings. The result is a poetry which, according to his detractors, can be cold, even callous, in the midst of war&#x27;s atrocities. For others, Douglas&#x27;s work is powerful and unsettling because its exact descriptions eschew egotism and shift the burden of emotion from the poet to the reader. His best poetry is generally considered to rank alongside the 20th century&#x27;s finest soldier-poetry.

In his poem, &quot;Desert Flowers&quot; (1943), Douglas mentions World War I poet Isaac Rosenberg, claiming that he is only repeating what Rosenberg has already written.

==Early life==
Douglas was born in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, the son of Capt. Keith Sholto Douglas, MC (retired) and Marie Josephine Castellain. His mother became unwell and collapsed in 1924 of encephalitis lethargica, never to fully recover. By 1926, the chicken farm business set up by his father had failed. Douglas was sent to Edgeborough School, a preparatory school in Guildford, the same year. The family became increasingly poor, and his father had to leave home in early 1928 to seek better employment in Wales. The persistent ill-health of Marie led to the collapse of the marriage of his parents by the end of that year, and his father remarried in 1930. Douglas was deeply hurt by his father not communicating with him after 1928, and when Capt. Douglas did write at last in 1938, Keith did not agree to meet him. In one of his letters written in 1940 Douglas looked back on his childhood: &quot;I lived alone during the most fluid and formative years of my life, and during that time I lived on my imagination, which was so powerful as to persuade me that the things I imagined would come true.&quot;

===Education===
Marie Douglas faced extreme financial distress, so much so that only the generosity of the Edgeborough headmaster Mr. James permitted Douglas to attend school in 1930–1931, his last year there. Douglas sat in 1931 for the entrance examination to Christ&#x27;s Hospital, where education was free and there was monetary assistance to cover all other costs. He was accepted, and joined Christ&#x27;s Hospital, near Horsham, in September 1931, studying there till 1938. It was at this school that his considerable poetic talent and artistic ability were recognised. So was his cavalier attitude to authority and property, which nearly led to expulsion in 1935 over a purloined training rifle. In surprising contrast, he excelled as a member of the school&#x27;s Officers Training Corps, particularly enjoying drill, although he was philosophically opposed to militarism.

===University===
After his bruising brush with authority in 1935, Douglas settled down to a less troubled and more productive period at school, during which he excelled both at studies and games, and at the end of which he won an open exhibition to Merton College, Oxford, in 1938 to read History and English. The First World War-veteran and well-known poet Edmund Blunden was his tutor at Merton, and regarded his poetic talent highly. Blunden sent his poems to T. S. Eliot, the doyen of English poetry, who found Douglas&#x27;s verses &#x27;impressive&#x27;. Douglas became the editor of &quot;Cherwell&quot;, and one of the poets anthologised in the collection &quot;Eight Oxford Poets&quot; (1941), although by the time that volume appeared he was already in the army. He does not seem to have been acquainted with somewhat junior but contemporary Oxford poets such as Sidney Keyes, Drummond Allison, John Heath-Stubbs and Philip Larkin, who would make names for themselves. At Oxford, he was good friends with the poet J. C. Hall who became his literary executor.

At Oxford, Douglas entered a relationship with a sophisticated Chinese student named Yingcheng, or Betty Sze, the daughter of a diplomat. Her own sentiments towards him were less intense, and she refused to marry him. Yingcheng remained the unrequited love of Douglas&#x27;s life and the source of his best romantic verse, despite his involvements with other women later, most notably Milena Guiterrez Penya.

==Military service==

Within days of the declaration of war he reported to an army recruiting centre with the intention of joining a cavalry regiment, but like many others keen to serve he had to wait, and it was not until July 1940 that he started his training. After attending the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, he was commissioned on 1 February 1941 into the 2nd Derbyshire Yeomanry at Ripon. He was posted to the Middle East in July 1941 and transferred to the Nottinghamshire (Sherwood Rangers) Yeomanry. Posted initially at Cairo and Palestine, he found himself stuck at headquarters twenty miles behind El Alamein as a camouflage officer as the Second Battle of El Alamein began. 

At dawn on 24 October 1942, the Regiment advanced, and suffered numerous casualties from enemy anti-tank guns. Chafing at the inactivity, Douglas took off against orders on 27 October, drove to the Regimental HQ in a truck and reported to the C.O., Colonel E. O. Kellett, lying that he had been instructed to go to the front (luckily this escapade did not land him in serious trouble; in a reprise of 1935, Douglas got off with an apology). Desperately needing officer replacements, the Colonel posted him to A Squadron, and gave him the opportunity to take part as a fighting tanker in the Eighth Army&#x27;s victorious sweep through North Africa, vividly recounted in his memoir &quot;Alamein to Zem Zem&quot;, which was illustrated with his own drawings.

===Death===
Captain Douglas returned from North Africa to England in December 1943 and took part in the D-Day invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944. On 9 June Douglas&#x27;s armoured unit was pinned down on high ground overlooking Tilly-sur-Seulles. Concerned by the lack of progress, Douglas dismounted his tank to undertake a personal reconnaissance during which he was killed by a German mortar. The regimental chaplain Captain Leslie Skinner buried him by a hedge, close to where he had died on &quot;forward slopes point 102&quot;. Shortly after the war his remains were reburied at Tilly-sur-Seulles War Cemetery (14 km south of Bayeux) in plot 1, row E, grave number 2.

==Play==
A one-man play about Douglas and his work, entitled &quot;Unicorns, almost&quot;, written by Owen Sheers, premiered at the Hay Festival in May 2018.

<doc id="338199" wikidata="Q901446" url="?curid=338199" title="Hasse diagram">
<text>In order theory, a Hasse diagram (; ) is a type of mathematical diagram used to represent a finite partially ordered set, in the form of a drawing of its transitive reduction. Concretely, for a partially ordered set formula_1 one represents each element of formula_2 as a vertex in the plane and draws a line segment or curve that goes &quot;upward&quot; from one vertex formula_3 to another vertex formula_4 whenever formula_4 covers formula_3 (that is, whenever formula_7, formula_8 and there is no formula_9 distinct from formula_3 and formula_4 with formula_12). These curves may cross each other but must not touch any vertices other than their endpoints. Such a diagram, with labeled vertices, uniquely determines its partial order.

Hasse diagrams are named after Helmut Hasse (1898–1979); according to Garrett Birkhoff, they are so called because of the effective use Hasse made of them. However, Hasse was not the first to use these diagrams. One example that predates Hasse can be found in an 1895 work by Henri Gustave Vogt. Although Hasse diagrams were originally devised as a technique for making drawings of partially ordered sets by hand, they have more recently been created automatically using graph drawing techniques.

In some sources, the phrase &quot;Hasse diagram&quot; has a different meaning: the directed acyclic graph obtained from the covering relation of a partially ordered set, independently of any drawing of that graph.

==Diagram design==

Although Hasse diagrams are simple, as well as intuitive, tools for dealing with finite posets, it turns out to be rather difficult to draw &quot;good&quot; diagrams. The reason is that, in general, there are many different possible ways to draw a Hasse diagram for a given poset. The simple technique of just starting with the minimal elements of an order and then drawing greater elements incrementally often produces quite poor results: symmetries and internal structure of the order are easily lost.

The following example demonstrates the issue. Consider the power set of a 4-element set ordered by inclusion formula_13. Below are four different Hasse diagrams for this partial order. Each subset has a node labelled with a binary encoding that shows whether a certain element is in the subset (1) or not (0):

The first diagram makes clear that the power set is a graded poset. The second diagram has the same graded structure, but by making some edges longer than others, it emphasizes that the 4-dimensional cube is a combinatorial union of two 3-dimensional cubes, and that a tetrahedron (abstract 3-polytope) likewise merges two triangles (abstract 2-polytopes). The third diagram shows some of the internal symmetry of the structure. In the fourth diagram the vertices are arranged in a 4×4 grid.

==Upward planarity==


If a partial order can be drawn as a Hasse diagram in which no two edges cross, its covering graph is said to be &quot;upward planar&quot;. A number of results on upward planarity and on crossing-free Hasse diagram construction are known:
*If the partial order to be drawn is a lattice, then it can be drawn without crossings if and only if it has order dimension at most two. In this case, a non-crossing drawing may be found by deriving Cartesian coordinates for the elements from their positions in the two linear orders realizing the order dimension, and then rotating the drawing counterclockwise by a 45-degree angle.
*If the partial order has at most one minimal element, or it has at most one maximal element, then it may be tested in linear time whether it has a non-crossing Hasse diagram.
*It is NP-complete to determine whether a partial order with multiple sources and sinks can be drawn as a crossing-free Hasse diagram. However, finding a crossing-free Hasse diagram is fixed-parameter tractable when parametrized by the number of articulation points and triconnected components of the transitive reduction of the partial order.
*If the &quot;y&quot;-coordinates of the elements of a partial order are specified, then a crossing-free Hasse diagram respecting those coordinate assignments can be found in linear time, if such a diagram exists. In particular, if the input poset is a graded poset, it is possible to determine in linear time whether there is a crossing-free Hasse diagram in which the height of each vertex is proportional to its rank.

==Use in UML notation==

In software engineering / Object-oriented design, the classes of a software system and the inheritance relation between these classes is often depicted using a class diagram, a form of Hasse diagram in which the edges connecting classes are drawn as solid line segments with an open triangle at the superclass end.

<text>Filipino [[orthography]] () specifies the correct use of the writing system of the Filipino language, the national and co-official language of the Philippines.

In 2013, the Komisyon sa Wikang Filipino released the &quot;Ortograpiyang Pambansa&quot; (“National Orthography”), a new set of guidelines for writing the Filipino language.

==Alphabet==
The modern Filipino alphabet introduced since 1987 consists of 28 letters (20 if you only count native letters).

==Notes on Filipino orthography==
* C, F, J, Ñ, Q, V, X, and Z are used mostly for loanwords, regional words and proper nouns.
* The vowels are A, E, I, O, and U.
* Usual diacritic marks are acute , grave , circumflex , diaeresis which are optional, and only used with the vowels. Grave and circumflex may only appear at the end of a word ending in a vowel. Diacritics have no impact on collation or alphabetical order. Possible combinations include: &quot;á, à, â, é, è, ê, ë, ë́, í, ì, î, ó, ò, ô, ú, ù, û&quot;. Historically, the tilde was used with &lt;g&gt; (&quot;g̃&quot;) in many Philippine languages. It was notably used to shorten the words &quot;nang&quot; (ergative case marker) and &quot;man͠gá&quot; (pluralization particle) into &quot;ng̃&quot; and &quot;mg̃á&quot; respectively. Today, these two words are usually just simply written as &quot;ng&quot; and &quot;mga&quot;.
* Ñ is considered as a separate letter, instead of a letter-diacritical mark combination.
* The alphabet also uses the Ng digraph, even originally with a large tilde that spanned both n and g (as in n͠g) when a vowel follows the digraph. This tilde indicates that the &quot;&quot;n͠g&quot; and the vowel should be pronounced as one syllable, such as &quot;n͠ga&quot; in the three-syllable word &quot;pan͠galan&quot;&quot; (&quot;name&quot;) – syllabicated as [pa-n͠ga-lan], not [pan-ga-lan]. The use of the tilde over the two letters is now rare. Due to technical constraints, machine-printed variants of &quot;&quot;n͠ga&quot; emerged, which included &quot;ñga&quot;, &quot;ng̃a&quot;, and even &quot;gña&quot;&quot; (as in the case of Sagñay, Camarines Sur).
* The Ng digraph letter is similar to, but not the same as, the prepositional word &quot;ng&quot; (&quot;of&quot;/&quot;of the&quot;), originally spelled &quot;ng̃&quot; (with a tilde over the &quot;g&quot; only). The words &quot;ng&quot; and &quot;ng̃&quot; are shortened forms of the word &quot;nang&quot;.
* &quot;Ë&quot; is a new variant of &quot;e&quot; introduced in 2013 to represent in Austronesian words of non-Tagalog origin.
* D and R are commonly interchangeable depending on the letter&#x27;s location: &quot;D&quot; becomes &quot;R&quot; if there is a preceding vowel, e.g. dagat&quot; (&quot;sea&quot;) to &quot;mandaragat&quot; (&quot;seafarer&quot;), dunong&quot; (&quot;intelligence&quot;) to &quot;marunong&quot; (&quot;knowledgeable&quot;). This does not, however, apply to some words such as &quot;dumadagundong&quot; (&quot;booming&quot;) as well as loanwords and proper nouns.

==History==

===Pre-Hispanic scripts===


During the Pre-Hispanic Era, most of the languages of the Philippines were written in abugida, an ancient segmental writing system. Examples of this ancient Philippine writing system which descended from the Brāhmī script are the Kawi, Baybayin, Buhid, Hanunó&#x27;o, Tagbanwa, Butuan, Kulitan and other Brahmic family of scripts known to antiquity. A controversial and debatable script of the Philippines is the Eskayan script.

Baybayin script began to decline in the 17th century and became obsolete in the 18th century. The scripts that are still in use today by the indigenous Mangyan groups of the Philippines are the Buhid and the Hanunó&#x27;o script.

===Adoption of the Latin script===

When the Spaniards arrived in 1521 and began to colonize the islands of the Philippines in 1565, they introduced the Latin script to the Catholicized Filipinos. When most of the Philippine languages were first written in the Latin script, they used the Spanish alphabet. This alphabet was called the Abecedario, the original alphabet of the Catholicized Filipinos, which variously had either 28, 29, 31, or 32 letters. Until the first half of the 20th century, most Philippine languages were widely written in a variety of ways based on Spanish orthography.

The writing system of the Muslim Filipinos in the different independent sultanates of Mindanao during the Spanish colonization shifted from abugida script to Arabic alphabet while the writing system of most of the Catholicized Chinese Filipinos shifted from Written Chinese to Abecedario alphabet.

Virtually unutilized from the Abecedario were the letters &quot;K&quot; and &quot;W&quot;, which are both used extensively in most Philippine languages today due to the imposition of the Abakada alphabet. Relics of this Abecedario alphabet can still be seen in the way &quot;Castilianized&quot; indigenous and Chinese-origin surnames are written. Some examples of indigenous Filipino surnames are &quot;Macasáquit&quot;, &quot;Guintô&quot;, &quot;Bañaga&quot;, &quot;Guipit&quot;, &quot;Abucajo&quot;, &quot;Abueg&quot;, &quot;Bangachon&quot;, &quot;Dagohoy&quot;, &quot;Valarao&quot; and &quot;Dimaculañgan&quot;. Some examples of Chinese-origin surnames are &quot;Guanzón&quot;, &quot;Cojuangco&quot;, &quot;Siapuatco&quot;, &quot;Yapchulay&quot;, &quot;Locsín&quot;, &quot;Quisumbing&quot;, &quot;Tuazon&quot; and &quot;Yuchengco&quot;. Many indigenous place names are also written using Spanish orthography, often either coexisting or competing with their indigenized forms if they exist (&quot;Bulacán&quot; or &quot;Bulakán&quot;, &quot;Caloocan&quot; or &quot;Kalookan&quot;, &quot;Taguig&quot; or &quot;Tagig&quot;, etc.). &quot;Parañaque&quot; would be written in the indigenized system as &quot;Paranyake&quot;, but the latter spelling is so far unaccepted and not known in use. &quot;Marikina&quot; on the other hand gained acceptance over the older &quot;Mariquina&quot;.

Quite notable are proper nouns wherein the letter &quot;Y&quot; is written before consonants and is pronounced &quot;I&quot;. Iloilo and Ilocos were spelled archaically as &quot;Yloylo&quot; or &quot;Yloílo&quot; and &quot;Ylocos&quot;. Surnames in the Philippines such as &quot;Ybañez&quot;, &quot;Ysagan&quot;, &quot;Ybarra&quot;, &quot;Yldefonso&quot; and &quot;Ylagan&quot; are evidences of the Old Spanish writing system. &quot;Ylang Ylang&quot;, a native Philippine tree valued for its perfume, is another example. The use of the letter &quot;Y&quot; at the beginning of words, however, gradually shifted to the letter &quot;I&quot; reflecting revisions in Spanish orthography.

The representation of certain sounds were largely derived from Spanish orthography but differed in several ways. The letter &quot;H&quot; was utilized to represent the voiceless glottal fricative () in the orthographies of most Philippine languages during the Spanish period in contrast to the orthography of Spanish which uses the letter &quot;J&quot; (the letter &quot;H&quot; in Spanish is silent). Spanish loanwords like &quot;Jesús&quot;, &quot;Justicia&quot;, or &quot;Jardín&quot;, however, often retained their original spelling in Spanish. Archaic use of the letter &quot;X&quot; in the Old Spanish writing system that is pronounced in a guttural way (quite similar phonetically to &quot;H&quot; in English even though the sound is different) is evident in surnames such as &quot;Roxas&quot;. Another example is &quot;México, Pampanga&quot;.

To represent , &quot;c&quot; was used before the vowels &quot;a&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, and &quot;u&quot; (i.e. cayo, cong, culang) and at final positions (pumasoc) while a silent &quot;u&quot; was used between &quot;q&quot; and &quot;e&quot; or &quot;i&quot; (i.e. &quot;aquing&quot;, &quot;quilala&quot;) reflecting Spanish orthography. This is because should &quot;c&quot; be utilized before either &quot;i&quot; or &quot;e&quot;, the sound produced would instead be representing (like Spanish &quot;ciudad&quot;). These two combination of letters (&quot;ci&quot; and &quot;ce&quot;) were not used in native words and &quot;s&quot; was used in all cases to represent . Likewise, in representing , &quot;g&quot; was used before &quot;a&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;u&quot; (i.e. &quot;gamit&quot;, &quot;tago&quot;, &quot;gutom&quot;) and at final positions while a silent &quot;u&quot; was used between &quot;g&quot; and &quot;e&quot; or &quot;i&quot; to (i.e. &quot;guitna&quot;) so that &quot;gue&quot; represents and &quot;gui&quot; represents .

The letter W as used today was absent. Instead, &quot;u&quot; was utilized (&quot;gaua&quot;, &quot;aua&quot;, &quot;uala&quot;) and diphthongs written as &quot;aw&quot; today (araw) was written with &quot;ao&quot; (arao). Words like &quot;huwag&quot; and &quot;kapwa&quot; were written as houag and capoua.

A common practice in the orthography of some of the Philippine languages during the Spanish colonial period up to the 1960s was the use of tilde written over &quot;g̃&quot;, a letter which was notably used to shorten the words &quot;nang&quot; (ergative case marker) and &quot;man͠gá&quot; (pluralization particle) into &quot;ng̃&quot; and &quot;mg̃á&quot; respectively. No literature could be found that pertained to the rules that governed the usage of this letter or that explained its disappearance. Today, these two words are usually just simply written as &quot;ng&quot; and &quot;mga&quot;.

Originally, there was a large tilde that spanned both &quot;n&quot; and &quot;g&quot; (as in n͠g) when a vowel follows the Ng digraph. This tilde indicates that the &quot;n͠g&quot; and the vowel should be pronounced as one syllable, such as &quot;n͠ga&quot; in the three-syllable word &quot;pan͠galan&quot; () – syllabicated as [pa-n͠ga-lan], not [pan-ga-lan]. The use of the tilde over the two letters is now virtually non-existent.

Due to technical constraints, machine-printed variants of &quot;n͠ga&quot; emerged, which included &quot;ñga&quot;, &quot;ng̃a&quot;, and even &quot;gña&quot; as in the case of Sagñay – syllabicated as [sa-ngay]. The Ng digraph letter is similar to, but not the same as, the prepositional word &quot;ng&quot; (), originally spelled &quot;ng̃&quot; with a tilde over the &quot;g&quot; only. The words &quot;ñg&quot; and &quot;ng̃&quot; are shortened forms of the word &quot;nang&quot;. There are some words with no tilde written over the &quot;ng&quot; digraph as in the case of barangay ( ) from the Tagalog word &quot;balan͠gay&quot; since it is syllabicated as [ba-rang-gay]. Ilonggo used to be written as &quot;Ylongo&quot; or &quot;Ilongo&quot; without a tilde over the &quot;ng&quot; since it is syllabicated as [i-long-go]. Another example is Zamboanga syllabicated as [zam-bo-ang-ga]. Words that end in &quot;ng&quot; digraph such as &quot;ang&quot; (), &quot;utang&quot; () and &quot;saguing&quot; () also didn&#x27;t have tildes over the &quot;n&quot; or &quot;g&quot; or both &quot;ng&quot;.

Contraction of certain words were indicated by two commas such as &quot;iba&quot; and &quot;at&quot; → &quot;iba, t,&quot;; Indicated today by a single quotation mark as in English (i.e. iba&#x27;t).

Diacritic marks were also utilized. Acute ( ´ ), grave ( ` ) and circumflex ( ˆ ) were required and only used with the vowels. The latter two may only appear at the end of a word ending in a vowel. Diacritics had no impact on the primary alphabetical order. Possible combinations include: &quot;á, à, â, é, è, ê, í, ì, î, ó, ò, ô, ú, ù and û&quot;.

Punctuation marks were also borrowed from Spanish. Quotation marks like &quot;« »&quot; instead of the quotation marks (&quot; &quot;) were used. The inverted question mark (¿) and inverted exclamation mark (¡) were also utilized at the beginning of phrases ending with either the regular question mark/exclamation mark. 

The vowels were pronounced in a short vowel length &quot;[A (ah), E (eh), I (ih), O (oh), U (uh)]&quot; while the consonants were pronounced as &quot;B (be), C (se), Ch (che), D (de), F (efe), G (he), H (ache), J (hota), K (ka), L (ele), LL (elye), M (eme), N (ene), NG (nang), Ñ (enye), Ñg or Ng̃ or N͠g or Gñ (ñga or ng̃a or n͠ga or gña), P (pe), Q (ku), R (ere), RR (er-re), S (ese), T (te), V (ve), W (wa), X (ekis), Y (ya or i griega or ye), Z (zeta).&quot; This alphabet gradually fell out of use since 1940 due to the imposition of the Abakada alphabet.

=== Late 19th-century orthographic reforms ===
Filipino doctor and student of languages Trinidad Pardo de Tavera in his 1887 essay &quot;El Sanscrito en la lengua Tagalog&quot; made use of a new Tagalog orthography rather than what had then been in use. In 1889, the new bilingual &quot;La España Oriental&quot;, of which Isabelo de los Reyes was an editor, newspaper began publishing using the new orthography stating in a footnote that it would &quot;use the orthography recently introduced by ... learned Orientalis&quot;. This new orthography, while having its supporters, was also not initially accepted by several writers. Soon after the first issue of &quot;La España&quot;, Pascual H. Poblete&#x27;s &quot;Revista Católica de Filipina&quot; began a series of articles attacking the new orthography and its proponents. A fellow writer, Pablo Tecson was also critical. The attacks included that the letters &quot;k&quot; and &quot;w&quot; were of German origin and foreign in nature, thus those promoting it were deemed &quot;unpatriotic&quot;. These two publications would eventually merge as &quot;La Lectura Popular&quot; in January 1890 and would eventually make use of both spelling systems in its articles.

Pedro Laktaw, a schoolteacher, published the first Spanish-Tagalog dictionary using the new orthography in 1890. In April 1890, Jose Rizal authored an article &quot;Sobre la Nueva Ortografia de la Lengua Tagalog&quot; in the Madrid-based periodical La Solidaridad. In it, he addressed the logicality, in his opinion, of the new orthography and its criticisms, including those by Pobrete and Tecson. Rizal described the orthography promoted by Tavera as &quot;more perfect&quot; than what he himself had developed. José Rizal had also suggested a reform of the orthography of the Philippine languages by replacing the letters &quot;C&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; with &quot;K&quot;. Rizal got the idea after reading an 1884 essay by Trinidad Pardo de Tavera about the ancient Baybayin script. The new orthography was however not broadly adopted initially and was used inconsistently in the bilingual periodicals of Manila.

The revolutionary society Kataás-taasan, Kagalang-galang Katipunan ng̃ mg̃á Anak ng̃ Bayan or Katipunan made use of the k-orthography and the letter k featured prominently on many of its flags and insignias.

===Filipino as the national language, the Abakada, and expanded alphabet (1940–1987)===
Article XIII, section 3 of the 1935 Constitution of the Philippines provided for the &quot;...development and adoption of a common national language based on one of the existing native languages&quot;. For this purpose, the Institute of National Language (INL) was subsequently set-up. After numerous debates among the different language representatives of the Philippines, the NLI passed a resolution dated November 9, 1937 recommending that Tagalog serve as basis for the national language. President Manuel L. Quezon issued Executive Order 134 in December 1937 officially proclaiming this decision.

In 1940, the &quot;Balarílà ng Wikang Pambansâ&quot; () of grammarian Lope K. Santos introduced the Abakada alphabet. This alphabet consists of 20 letters and became the standard alphabet of the national language. The alphabet was officially adopted by the Institute for the Tagalog-Based National Language to “indigenize&quot; the writing system (The Latin script itself (the alphabet) was introduced by the Catholic missionaries of Spain, leaving nothing really to &quot;indigenize&quot;).

The Spanish-based orthographies of other Philippine languages that were still using its old orthography began to be gradually replaced with the propagation of the new K-orthographies as more people became familiar with it. The Spanish-based orthographies were gradually wiped out since 1940, due to the imposition of Abakada. The Abakada orthography gradually influenced the languages of the Philippines.

The Abakada orthography was guided by the &quot;Balarilà&quot; of Santos. Vowels were pronounced with a short vowel length, while consonants were pronounced by appending short &quot;A&#x27;s&quot; at the end. Hence, the name Abakada, from the first 4 letters of the alphabet.

Collation of the &quot;Abakada&quot; (20 letters):
The &quot;Wikang pambansa&quot; (national language) was designated as &quot;Pilipino&quot; in 1959. In 1971, the alphabet was expanded to 31 letters: a, b, c, ch, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, ll, m, n, ñ, ng, o, p, q, r, rr, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z.

===Modern Filipino alphabet (1987–present)===
In 1987, the official language called Pilipino was renamed to Filipino. Article XIV Section 6 of the 1987 Constitution states that &quot;the National language of the Philippines is Filipino. As it evolves, it shall be further developed and enriched on the basis of existing Philippine and other languages&quot;.

The Pilipino alphabet was reduced to 28 letters, with the Spanish &quot;Ch&quot;, &quot;Ll&quot; and &quot;Rr&quot; digraphs being dropped from being considered as distinct letters (The Association of Spanish Language Academies itself abandoned the use of &quot;Ch&quot; and &quot;Ll&quot; as separate listings in alphabetical collations in 1994. Since 2010, &quot;ch&quot; and &quot;ll&quot; are no longer considered distinct letters. Each digraph is now treated as a sequence of two distinct characters, finding occasional use as conjoined pairs.).

The Modern Filipino alphabet is primarily English alphabet plus the Spanish &quot;Ñ&quot; and Tagalog &quot;Ng&quot; digraph; these are alphabetised separately in theory. Today, the Modern Filipino alphabet is used, and may also serve as the alphabet for all autochthonous Philippine languages.

==The Orthography of the National Language==
In August 2007, the Commission on the Filipino Language made available a draft version of Filipino orthography open for comment. This document is a result of a series of consultations with various teachers, instructors, linguists and others in the field that took place between 2006 and 2007.

The document begins by detailing the letters of the alphabet, their order and their names. One set of names is based on English letter names; the other, similar to the former &quot;Abakada&quot;. Some exceptional names are those letters which were not part of the &quot;Abakada&quot;: &quot;C&quot;, &quot;se&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;kwa&quot; and &quot;X&quot;, &quot;eksa&quot;.

It goes on to name punctuation marks, and describes the use of the acute, grave and circumflex accents in Filipino. Words that already exist in the language are preferred over a borrowed term, for example, &quot;tuntunin&quot; vs. &quot;rul&quot; (derived from English &quot;rule&quot;). In terms of spelling, issues concerning the use of &quot;y-/iy-&quot; and &quot;w-/uw-&quot; are codified according to the number of preceding consonants and the origin of the word if it is borrowed.

Lastly, it provides spelling guidelines for words of foreign origin. It focuses mainly on the two languages that have provided a large number of lexical items to the Filipino language, namely Spanish and English. In short, regarding borrowings from these two languages, Spanish words of common usage are written in a manner consistent with Filipino phonology. These words are already in common usage, thus they will not revert to their Spanish spelling. On the other hand, if the words come from English or another foreign source or if the term is derived from Spanish that does not already have a phonetic spelling, it should be spelled phonetically and the use of the 8 new letters is allowed.

Examples:

*Spanish teléfono = telépono NOT *teléfono
*English psychology = saykoloji
*Spanish psicología or sicología = sikolohíya
*Spanish silla = silya
*Spanish cuchara = kutsara
*Spanish caballo = kabayo

== Evolution example ==
Below is an example of orthography between the Tagalog (Early Spanish-style system) and Filipino (derived from multiple tribe coalitions.) The text used for comparison is the Filipino version of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer. The phrase in square brackets is the doxology &quot;for thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory forever&quot;.

: Early Tagalog System (taken from &quot;Doctrina Christiana&quot;,)
: &quot;Ama namin, nasa Lan͠gitca,&quot;
: &quot;Ypasamba Mo ang N͠galanmo.&quot;
: &quot;Mouisaamin ang pagcaharimo.&quot;
: &quot;Ypasonor mo ang loob mo&quot;
: &quot;Dito sa lupa para sa Lan͠git.&quot;
: &quot;Bigya mo cami n͠gaion ng amin cacanin para nang sa arao-arao.&quot;
: &quot;At patauarin Mo ang amin casalanã,&quot;
: &quot;Yaiang uinaualan bahala namĩ sa loob&quot;
: &quot;Ang casalanan nang nagcacasala sa amin.&quot;
: &quot;Houag Mo caming æwan nang dicami matalo ng tocso,&quot;
: &quot;Datapouat yadia mo cami sa dilan masama.&quot;
: [&quot;Sapagcat iyo an caharian at capaniarihan&quot;
: &quot;At caloualhatian, magpacailan man.&quot;]
: &quot;Amen Jesús.&quot;
: Modern Filipino orthography
: &quot;Amá namin, sumasalangit Ka,&quot;
: &quot;Sambahín ang Ngalan Mo.&quot;
: &quot;Mapasaamin ang kaharián Mo.&quot;
: &quot;Sundín ang loób Mo&quot;
: &quot;Dito sa lupà, para nang sa langit.&quot;
: &quot;Bigyán Mo kamí ngayón ng aming kakanin sa araw-araw.&quot;
: &quot;At patawarin Mo kamí sa aming mga salà,&quot;
: &quot;Para nang pagpápatawad namin&quot;
: &quot;Sa mga nagkakasalà sa amin.&quot;
: &quot;At huwág Mo kamíng ipahintulot sa tuksô,&quot;
: &quot;At iadyâ Mo kamí sa lahát ng masamâ.&quot;
: [&quot;Sapagkát sa Iyó ang kaharián, at ang kapangyarihan,&quot;
: &quot;At ang kaluwálhatian, magpakailanmán.&quot;]
: &quot;Amen&quot; &quot;Hesús&quot;.

<text>Sidney Arthur Kilworth Keyes (27 May 1922 – 29 April 1943) was an English poet of World War II.

== Life ==

=== Early years and education ===
Keyes was born on 27 May 1922 at the family home, only child of Reginald Keyes, of The Homestead, West Hill, Dartford, Kent, a flour miller who had been a captain in the Queen&#x27;s Own Royal West Kent Regiment, and his second wife, Edith Mary, daughter of Rev. Arthur Blackburn, rector of St Paul&#x27;s, Bradford. His mother died of peritonitis when he was six weeks old, and he was raised by his paternal grandparents. His grandfather, Sidney Kilworth Keyes, was a wealthy farmer and dominant figure in the family. Keyes started writing poetry when still very young, with Wordsworth, Rilke and Jung among his main influences. He attended Dartford Grammar School and then boarded at Tonbridge School (Hillside, 1935-1940), after which he won a history scholarship to Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford. While at college, Keyes wrote the only two books of his lifetime, &quot;The Cruel Solstice&quot; and &quot;The Iron Laurel&quot;. During his time in Oxford, Keyes fell in love with the young German artist Milein Cosman, but his love was not returned. He also befriended fellow poets John Heath-Stubbs and Michael Meyer, edited &quot;The Cherwell&quot; magazine, and formed a dramatic society.

&quot;The Iron Laurel&quot; was published during World War II in 1942, when Keyes was 20 years old. His poetry was also published in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, &quot;The Listener&quot; and other poetry journals.

=== Military service ===
Keyes left Oxford and joined the British Army in April 1942, entering active service that same year. He was soon commissioned in the Queens Own Royal West Kent Regiment and served with his regiment&#x27;s 1st Battalion, part of the 4th Division, to fight in the final stages of the Tunisian campaign in March 1943. Prior to his service, Keyes had already written more than half of the 110 poems that would later be gathered in &quot;The Collected Poems of Sidney Keyes&quot;. During combat, he was reported to have continued writing poetry. However, these works have not survived.

=== Death ===
Keyes was killed in action on 29 April 1943, covering his platoon&#x27;s retreat during a counter-attack, shortly before his 21st birthday. It has also been stated that he died at the hands of the enemy, following his capture.

== Recognition ==
In 1943, Keyes was awarded the Hawthornden Prize for &quot;The Cruel Solstice&quot; and &quot;The Iron Laurel&quot;. He has been described as one of the outstanding poets of the Second World War.

<doc id="338206" wikidata="Q1946484" url="?curid=338206" title="Monty Cantsin">
<text>Monty Cantsin is a multiple-use name that anyone can adopt, but has close ties to Neoism. Monty Cantsin was originally conceived as an &quot;open pop star.&quot; In a philosophy anticipating that of free software and open source, anyone could perform in his name and thus contribute to and participate in his fame and achievements.

==History==
The name was coined in 1978 by the critic, prankster and Mail Artist David Zack as a pen name for the Latvian-born poet and singer Maris Kundzins. It further alludes to:

* Martial Canterel, the wizard-hero of Raymond Roussel&#x27;s novel &quot;Locus Solus&quot;;
* Monte Capanno, a Northern Italian villa near Perugia where Zack had taught a San Jose State College study and living community in 1970;
* Monte Cazazza, a Californian performance artist and industrial music performer;
* Istvan Kantor, the second bearer of the name;
* &quot;Monty can&#x27;t sing&quot;;
* &quot;Monty can&#x27;t sin&quot;, a reference to religious free spirit movements which collectively adopted the names of Jesus or saints.

Zack called upon his correspondents to adopt the name Monty Cantsin. His suggestion was taken up in 1979 by the Hungarian-Canadian performance artist Istvan Kantor, who amalgamated the name into Neoism. As the shared identity of all Neoists, Monty Cantsin was transformed from a &quot;pop star&quot; to a radical identity experiment occupying the everyday life of Neoists and culminating in frequently extremist ways at Neoist Apartment Festivals (&quot;APTs&quot;). The &quot;open pop star&quot; concept lived on in a series of electropop and industrial music albums and performances of, mainly, Istvan Kantor.

==Influences==
Later multiple names like Karen Eliot and Luther Blissett drew inspiration from Monty Cantsin and Neoism, but intentionally avoided association with physical persons, being conceived either as mere signatures (Eliot), collective media phantoms (Blissett) or multiple single collective experiments.

==Publications==
* (as editor): &quot;Neoist Book&quot;, Canada, 1984.

<doc id="338207" wikidata="Q9228" url="?curid=338207" title="Burmese language">
<text>Burmese (; ) is a Tibeto-Burman language spoken in Myanmar, where it is the official language, lingua franca, and the native language of the Bamar, the country&#x27;s largest ethnic group. Burmese is also spoken by the indigenous tribes in Bangladesh&#x27;s Chittagong Hill Tracts, India&#x27;s Mizoram, Manipur, Tripura states and the Burmese diaspora. The Constitution of Myanmar officially refers to it as the Myanmar language in English, though most English speakers continue to refer to the language as &quot;Burmese&quot;, after &quot;Burma&quot;—a name with co-official status until 1989 (see Names of Myanmar). Burmese is the most widely-spoken language in the country, where it serves as the lingua franca. In 2019, Burmese was spoken by 42.9 million people globally, including by 32.9 million speakers as a first language, and an additional 10 million speakers as a second language. A 2023 World Bank survey found that 80% of the country&#x27;s population speaks Burmese.

Burmese is a tonal, pitch-register, and syllable-timed language, largely monosyllabic and agglutinative with a subject–object–verb word order. Burmese is distinguished from other major Southeast Asian languages by its extensive case marking system and rich morphological inventory. It is a member of the Lolo-Burmese grouping of the Sino-Tibetan language family. The Burmese alphabet is ultimately descended from a Brahmic script, either the Kadamba or Pallava alphabets.

== Classification ==
Burmese belongs to the Southern Burmish branch of the Sino-Tibetan languages. Burmese is the most widely spoken of the non-Sinitic Sino-Tibetan languages. Burmese was the fifth of the Sino-Tibetan languages to develop a writing system, after Classical Chinese, Pyu, Old Tibetan and Tangut.

=== Dialects ===
The majority of Burmese speakers, who live throughout the Irrawaddy River Valley, use variants of standard Burmese, while a minority speak non-standard dialects found in the peripheral areas of the country. These dialects include:
* Tanintharyi Region: Merguese (Myeik, Beik), Tavoyan (Dawei), and Palaw
* Magway Region: Yaw
* Shan State: Intha, Taungyo, and Danu

Arakanese in Rakhine State and Marma in Bangladesh are also sometimes considered dialects of Burmese and sometimes as separate languages.

Burmese dialects mostly share a common set of tones, consonant clusters, and written script. Several Burmese dialects differ substantially from standard Burmese with respect to vocabulary, lexical particles, and rhymes. Below is a summary of lexical similarity between major Burmese dialects:
==== Irrawaddy River valley ====
Spoken Burmese is remarkably uniform among Burmese speakers, particularly those living in the Irrawaddy valley, all of whom use variants of Standard Burmese. The standard dialect of Burmese (the Mandalay-Yangon dialect continuum) originates from the Irrawaddy River valley. Regional differences between speakers from Upper Burma (e.g., Mandalay dialect), called &quot;anya tha&quot; () and speakers from Lower Burma (e.g., Yangon dialect), called &quot;auk tha&quot; (), largely occur in vocabulary choice, not in pronunciation. Minor lexical and rhyme differences exist throughout the Irrawaddy River valley. For instance, for the term , &quot;food offering [to a monk]&quot;, Lower Burmese speakers use instead of , which is the pronunciation used in Upper Burma.

The standard dialect is typified by the Yangon dialect because of the modern city&#x27;s media influence and economic clout. In the past, the Mandalay dialect represented standard Burmese. The most noticeable feature of the Mandalay dialect is its continued use of the first-person pronoun , &quot;kya.nau&quot; by both men and women. In Yangon, only male speakers use the same pronoun, while female speakers use , &quot;kya.ma.&quot; . Moreover, with regard to kinship terminology, Upper Burmese speakers differentiate the maternal and paternal sides of a family, whereas Lower Burmese speakers do not.

Mon has also influenced subtle grammatical differences between the varieties of Burmese spoken in Lower and Upper Burma. In Lower Burmese varieties, the verb ပေး (&#x27;to give&#x27;) is colloquially used as a permissive causative marker, similar to other Southeast Asian languages, but unlike in most Tibeto-Burman languages. This usage is hardly used in Upper Burmese varieties, and is considered a sub-standard construct.

==== Outside the Irrawaddy basin ====
More distinctive non-standard varieties of Burmese emerge as one moves farther away from the Irrawaddy River valley toward peripheral areas of the country. These varieties include the Yaw, Palaw, Myeik (Merguese), Tavoyan and Intha dialects. Despite substantial vocabulary and pronunciation differences, there is mutual intelligibility among most Burmese dialects, especially with language convergence.

Dialects in Tanintharyi Region, including Palaw, Merguese, and Tavoyan, are especially conservative in comparison to Standard Burmese. The Tavoyan and Intha dialects have preserved the medial, which is only found in Old Burmese inscriptions. These dialects also often reduce the intensity of the glottal stop. Beik has 250,000 speakers while Tavoyan has 400,000. The grammatical constructs of Burmese dialects in Southern Myanmar show greater Mon influence than Standard Burmese.

The most pronounced feature of the Arakanese language of Rakhine State is its retention of the sound, which has become in standard Burmese. Moreover, Arakanese features a variety of vowel differences, including the merger of the and vowels. Hence, a word like &quot;blood&quot; is pronounced in standard Burmese and in Arakanese.

== History ==
The Burmese language&#x27;s early forms include Old Burmese and Middle Burmese. Old Burmese dates from the 11th to the 16th century (Pagan to Ava dynasties); Middle Burmese from the 16th to the 18th century (Toungoo to early Konbaung dynasties); modern Burmese from the mid-18th century to the present. While Burmese phonology has evolved significantly, word order, grammatical structure, and vocabulary have remained markedly stable well into Modern Burmese, with the exception of lexical content (e.g., function words).

=== Old Burmese ===

The earliest attested form of the Burmese language is called Old Burmese, dating to the 11th and 12th century stone inscriptions of Pagan. The earliest evidence of the Burmese alphabet is dated to 1035, while a casting made in the 18th century of an old stone inscription points to 984.

Owing to the linguistic prestige of Old Pyu in the Pagan Kingdom era, Old Burmese borrowed a substantial corpus of vocabulary from Pali via the Pyu language. These indirect borrowings can be traced back to orthographic idiosyncrasies in these loanwords, such as the Burmese word &quot;to worship&quot;, which is spelt ပူဇော် () instead of ပူဇာ (), as would be expected by the original Pali orthography.

In the mid-15th century, bilingual Pali-Burmese texts called &quot;nissaya&quot; (နိဿယ) emerged. These texts played a significant role in shaping the standard language, leading Burmese postpositional markers to be reinterpreted as equivalents of Pali inflections, giving them new grammatical roles that were compatible with their original use but not inherent to them. Over time, these markers became integral to the morphological structure of Burmese and were seen as more obligatory in literary Burmese, and to a lesser extent, colloquial Burmese.

=== Middle Burmese ===

The transition to Middle Burmese occurred in the 16th century. The transition to Middle Burmese included phonological changes (e.g. mergers of sound pairs that were distinct in Old Burmese) as well as accompanying changes in the underlying orthography.

From the 1500s onward, Burmese kingdoms saw substantial gains in the populace&#x27;s literacy rate, which manifested itself in greater participation of laymen in scribing and composing legal and historical documents, domains that were traditionally the domain of Buddhist monks, and drove the ensuing proliferation of Burmese literature, both in terms of genres and works. During this period, the Burmese alphabet began employing cursive-style circular letters typically used in palm-leaf manuscripts, as opposed to the traditional square block-form letters used in earlier periods. The orthographic conventions used in written Burmese today can largely be traced back to Middle Burmese.

=== Modern Burmese ===
Modern Burmese emerged in the mid-18th century. By this time, male literacy in Burma stood at nearly 50%, which enabled the wide circulation of legal texts, royal chronicles, and religious texts. A major reason for the uniformity of the Burmese language was the near-universal presence of Buddhist monasteries (called &quot;kyaung&quot;) in Burmese villages. These &quot;kyaung&quot; served as the foundation of the pre-colonial monastic education system, which fostered uniformity of the language throughout the Upper Irrawaddy valley, the traditional homeland of Burmese speakers. The 1891 Census of India, conducted five years after the annexation of the entire Konbaung Kingdom, found that the former kingdom had an &quot;unusually high male literacy&quot; rate of 62.5% for Upper Burmans aged 25 and above. For all of British Burma, the literacy rate was 49% for men and 5.5% for women (by contrast, British India more broadly had a male literacy rate of 8.44%).

The expansion of the Burmese language into Lower Burma also coincided with the emergence of Modern Burmese. As late as the mid-1700s, Mon, an Austroasiatic language, was the principal language of Lower Burma, employed by the Mon people who inhabited the region. Lower Burma&#x27;s shift from Mon to Burmese was accelerated by the Burmese-speaking Konbaung Dynasty&#x27;s victory over the Mon-speaking Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom in 1757. By 1830, an estimated 90% of the population in Lower Burma self-identified as Burmese-speaking Bamars; huge swaths of former Mon-speaking territory, from the Irrawaddy Delta to upriver in the north, spanning Bassein (now Pathein) and Rangoon (now Yangon) to Tharrawaddy, Toungoo, Prome (now Pyay), and Henzada (now Hinthada), were now Burmese-speaking. The language shift has been ascribed to a combination of population displacement, intermarriage, and voluntary changes in self-identification among increasingly Mon–Burmese bilingual populations in the region.

Standardized tone marking in written Burmese was not achieved until the 18th century. From the 19th century onward, orthographers created spellers to reform Burmese spelling, because of ambiguities that arose over transcribing sounds that had been merged. British rule saw continued efforts to standardize Burmese spelling through dictionaries and spellers.

Britain&#x27;s gradual annexation of Burma throughout the 19th century, in addition to concomitant economic and political instability in Upper Burma (e.g., increased tax burdens from the Burmese crown, British rice production incentives, etc.) also accelerated the migration of Burmese speakers from Upper Burma into Lower Burma. British rule in Burma eroded the strategic and economic importance of the Burmese language; Burmese was effectively subordinated to the English language in the colonial educational system, especially in higher education.

In the 1930s, the Burmese language saw a linguistic revival, precipitated by the establishment of an independent University of Rangoon in 1920 and the inception of a Burmese language major at the university by Pe Maung Tin, modeled on Anglo Saxon language studies at the University of Oxford. Student protests in December of that year, triggered by the introduction of English into matriculation examinations, fueled growing demand for Burmese to become the medium of education in British Burma; a short-lived but symbolic parallel system of &quot;national schools&quot; that taught in Burmese, was subsequently launched. The role and prominence of the Burmese language in public life and institutions was championed by Burmese nationalists, intertwined with their demands for greater autonomy and independence from the British in the lead-up to the independence of Burma in 1948.

The 1948 Constitution of Burma prescribed Burmese as the official language of the newly independent nation. The Burma Translation Society and Rangoon University&#x27;s Department of Translation and Publication were established in 1947 and 1948, respectively, with the joint goal of modernizing the Burmese language in order to replace English across all disciplines. Anti-colonial sentiment throughout the early post-independence era led to a reactionary switch from English to Burmese as the national medium of education, a process that was accelerated by the Burmese Way to Socialism. In August 1963, the socialist Union Revolutionary Government established the Literary and Translation Commission (the immediate precursor of the Myanmar Language Commission) to standardize Burmese spelling, diction, composition, and terminology. The latest spelling authority, named the &quot;Myanma Salonpaung Thatpon Kyan&quot; (), was compiled in 1978 by the commission.

== Registers ==
===Diglossia===
Burmese is a diglossic language with two distinguishable registers (or diglossic varieties):
# Literary High (H) form ( &quot;mranma ca&quot;): the high variety (formal and written), used in literature (formal writing), newspapers, radio broadcasts, and formal speeches
# Spoken Low (L) form ( &quot;mranma ca.ka:&quot;): the low variety (informal and spoken), used in daily conversation, television, comics and literature (informal writing)

The literary form of Burmese retains archaic and conservative grammatical structures and modifiers (including affixes and pronouns) no longer used in the colloquial form. Most verbs and some nouns also have longer forms in literary Burmese. Literary Burmese, which has not changed significantly since the 13th century, is the register of Burmese taught in schools. Case marking is highly developed and consistently used in literary Burmese, covering markers for subjects, direct objects, indirect objects, the ablative and locative. Spoken Burmese also uses case markers, but does so less consistently, particularly for subjects and direct object marking. The equivalent affixes used in Literary and Spoken Burmese are totally unrelated to each other. Examples of this phenomenon include the following lexical terms:

Historically the literary register was preferred for written Burmese on the grounds that &quot;the spoken style lacks gravity, authority, dignity&quot;. In the mid-1960s, some Burmese writers attempted to abandon the literary form in favour of the spoken vernacular form. Some Burmese linguists such as Minn Latt, a Czech academic, proposed moving away from the high form of Burmese altogether. Although the literary form is heavily used in written and official contexts (literary and scholarly works, radio news broadcasts, and novels), the recent trend has been to accommodate the spoken form in informal written contexts. Nowadays, television news broadcasts, comics, and commercial publications use the spoken form or a combination of the spoken and simpler, less ornate formal forms.

Burmese uses also distinct spoken and written forms for question pronouns. The following examples demonstrate significant differences in the pronouns, verbs, and other markers used between the literary and spoken forms (contrasts in bold):

===Honorific terms===

Burmese has politeness levels and honorifics that take into account the speaker&#x27;s status and age in relation to the audience. The suffix (&quot;pa&quot;) is frequently used after a verb to express politeness. Moreover, Burmese pronouns relay varying degrees of deference or respect. Polite speech (e.g., addressing teachers, officials, or elders) employs feudal-era third person pronouns or kinship terms in lieu of first- and second-person pronouns. 

Honorific vocabulary is used in Burmese to distinguish Buddhist clergy from the laity (householders), especially when speaking to or about bhikkhus (monks). Distinct honorific vocabulary (often euphemistic in nature) is also employed to distinguish commoners from royals. The honorific markers (&quot;daw&quot;) and - (&quot;dawmu&quot;) are suffixed to nouns and verbs respectively, in relation to Buddhist clergy and royals. Lexical items from standard Burmese, royal vocabulary, and clerical vocabulary are shown side by side in the table below:
== Vocabulary ==
Burmese has primarily inherited its monosyllabic vocabulary from Sino-Tibetan stock. The language has also adopted polysyllabic loanwords from Indo-European languages like Pali and English, as well as sesquisyllabic words from Mon, an Austroasiatic language. Burmese loanwords are overwhelmingly in the form of nouns.

Of the Indo-European languages, Pali, the liturgical language of Theravada Buddhism, had the most profound influence on enriching the Burmese vocabulary. Burmese has readily adopted words of Pali origin; this may be due to phonotactic similarities between the two languages, and the Burmese script&#x27;s inherent ability to reproduce Pali spellings with complete accuracy. Pali loanwords are often related to religion, government, arts, and science. Burmese loanwords from Pali primarily take four forms:
# Direct loan: direct import of Pali words with no alteration in orthography
# Abbreviated loan: import of Pali words with accompanied syllable reduction and alteration in orthography, usually by means of a placing a diacritic, called &quot;athat&quot; (l) atop the last letter in the syllable to suppress the consonant&#x27;s inherent vowel
# Double loan: adoption of two different terms derived from the same Pali word
# Hybrid loan (e.g., neologisms or calques): construction of compounds combining native Burmese words with Pali or combine Pali words

Burmese has also adapted numerous words from Mon, traditionally spoken by the Mon people of Lower Burma. Most Mon loanwords are so well assimilated that they are not distinguished as loanwords, as Burmese and Mon were used interchangeably for several centuries in pre-colonial Burma. Mon loans are often related to flora, fauna, administration, textiles, foods, boats, crafts, architecture, and music.

As a natural consequence of British rule in Burma, English has been another major source of vocabulary, especially with regard to technology, measurements, and modern institutions. English loanwords tend to take one of three forms:
# Direct loan: adoption of an English word, adapted to the Burmese phonology
#* &quot;democracy&quot;: English &quot;democracy&quot; → Burmese 
# Neologism or calque: translation of an English word using native Burmese constituent words
#* &quot;human rights&quot;: English &#x27;human rights&#x27; → Burmese ( &#x27;human&#x27; + &#x27;rights&#x27;)
# Hybrid loan: construction of compound words by joining native Burmese words to English words
#* &#x27;to sign&#x27;: ← (English, &quot;sign&quot;) + (native Burmese, &#x27;inscribe&#x27;).

To a lesser extent, Burmese has also imported words from Sanskrit (religion), Hindi (food, administration, and shipping), and Chinese (games and food). Burmese has also imported a handful of words from other European languages such as Portuguese.

Here is a sample of loan words found in Burmese:
Since the end of British rule, the Burmese government has attempted to limit usage of Western loans (especially from English) by coining new words (neologisms). For instance, for the word &quot;television&quot;, Burmese publications are mandated to use the term () in lieu of , a direct English transliteration. Another example is the word &quot;vehicle&quot;, which is officially (derived from Pali) but (from English &quot;car&quot;) in spoken Burmese. Some previously common English loanwords have fallen out of use with the adoption of indigenous neologisms. An example is the word &quot;university&quot;, formerly , from English &quot;university&quot;, now , a Pali-derived neologism recently created by the Burmese government and derived from the Pali spelling of Taxila ( &quot;Takkasīla&quot;), an ancient university town in modern-day Pakistan.

Some words in Burmese may have many synonyms, each having certain usages, such as formal, literary, colloquial, and poetic. One example is the word &quot;moon&quot;, which can be (native Tibeto-Burman), (derivatives of Pali &quot;canda&quot; &#x27;moon&#x27;), or (Sanskrit).

== Phonology ==
=== Consonants ===
The consonants of Burmese are as follows:

According to , contrary to their use of symbols θ and ð, consonants of are dental stops (), rather than fricatives () or affricates. These phonemes, alongside , are prone to merger with .

An alveolar can occur as an alternate of in some loanwords.

The final nasal is the value of the four native final nasals: , , , , as well as the retroflex (used in Pali loans) and nasalisation mark anusvara demonstrated here above ka (က → ကံ) which most often stands in for a homorganic nasal word medially as in &#x27;door&#x27;, and &#x27;bridge&#x27;, or else replaces final &quot;-m&quot; in both Pali and native vocabulary, especially after the OB vowel *u e.g. &#x27;salty&#x27;, သုံး &quot;thóum&quot; (&#x27;three; use&#x27;), and ဆုံး &#x27;end&#x27;. It does not, however, apply to which is never realised as a nasal, but rather as an open front vowel or .
The final nasal is usually realised as nasalisation of the vowel. It may also allophonically appear as a homorganic nasal before stops. For example, in (&#x27;storm&#x27;), which is pronounced .

=== Vowels ===
The vowels of Burmese are:

The monophthongs , , , and occur only in open syllables (those without a syllable coda); the diphthongs , , and occur only in closed syllables (those with a syllable coda). only occurs in a minor syllable, and is the only vowel that is permitted in a minor syllable (see below).

The close vowels and and the close portions of the diphthongs are somewhat mid-centralized () in closed syllables, i.e. before and . Thus (&#x27;two&#x27;) is phonetically and (&#x27;cat&#x27;) is phonetically .

=== Tones ===
Burmese is a tonal language, which means phonemic contrasts can be made on the basis of the tone of a vowel. In Burmese, these contrasts involve not only pitch, but also phonation, intensity (loudness), duration, and vowel quality. However, some linguists consider Burmese a pitch-register language like Shanghainese. Spoken Burmese exhibits tone sandhi in the form of a shift from a low to an induced creaky tone, to indicate possession.

There are four contrastive tones in Burmese. In the following table, the tones are shown marked on the vowel as an example.
For example, the following words are distinguished from each other only on the basis of tone:
* Low &quot;shake&quot;
* High &quot;be bitter&quot;
* Creaky &quot;to wait upon; to attend on&quot;
* Checked &quot;to beat; to strike&quot;

In syllables ending with , the checked tone is excluded:
* Low &quot;undergo&quot;
* High &quot;dry up (usually a river)&quot;
* Creaky &quot;appoint&quot;

In spoken Burmese, some linguists classify two real tones (there are four nominal tones transcribed in written Burmese), &quot;high&quot; (applied to words that terminate with a stop or check, high-rising pitch) and &quot;ordinary&quot; (unchecked and non-glottal words, with falling or lower pitch), with those tones encompassing a variety of pitches. The &quot;ordinary&quot; tone consists of a range of pitches. Linguist L. F. Taylor concluded that &quot;conversational rhythm and euphonic intonation possess importance&quot; not found in related tonal languages and that &quot;its tonal system is now in an advanced state of decay.&quot;

Spoken Burmese exhibits tone sandhi in the form of a shift from a low to an induced creaky tone: to indicate possession and to pronounce low-toned numerals in conjunction with other digits. For the former, this does not occur in literary Burmese, which uses ၏ as postpositional marker for possessive case instead of . Examples include the following:



=== Syllable structure ===
The syllable structure of Burmese is C(G)V((V)C), which is to say the onset consists of a consonant optionally followed by a glide, and the rime consists of a monophthong alone, a monophthong with a consonant, or a diphthong with a consonant. The only consonants that can stand in the coda are and . Some representative words are:

A minor syllable has some restrictions:
* It contains as its only vowel
* It must be an open syllable (no coda consonant)
* It cannot bear tone
* It has only a simple (C) onset (no glide after the consonant)
* It must not be the final syllable of the word

The Mon language is attributed with the development of frequent sesquisyllabic reduction in Burmese words, a pattern that does not appear in other Burmic languages. Some examples of words containing minor syllables:
* &#x27;switch, button&#x27;
* &#x27;flute&#x27;
* &#x27;mock&#x27;
* &#x27;be wanton&#x27;
* &#x27;rice-water&#x27;

== Writing system ==

The Burmese alphabet consists of 33 letters and 12 vowels and is written from left to right. It requires no spaces between words, although modern writing usually contains spaces after each clause to enhance readability. Characterized by its circular letters and diacritics, the script is an abugida, with all letters having an inherent vowel &quot;a.&quot; or . The consonants are arranged into six consonant groups (called &quot;vag&quot;) based on articulation, like other Brahmi scripts. Tone markings and vowel modifications are written as diacritics placed to the left, right, top, and bottom of letters.

Orthographic changes subsequent to shifts in phonology (such as the merging of the and medials) rather than transformations in Burmese grammatical structure and phonology, which by contrast, has remained stable between Old Burmese and modern Burmese. For example, during the Pagan era, the medial was transcribed in writing, which has been replaced by medials and in modern Burmese (e.g. &quot;school&quot; in old Burmese → in modern Burmese). Likewise, written Burmese has preserved all nasalized finals , which have merged to in spoken Burmese. (The exception is , which, in spoken Burmese, can be one of many open vowels .) Similarly, other consonantal finals have been reduced to . Similar mergers are seen in other Sino-Tibetan languages like Shanghainese, and to a lesser extent, Cantonese.

Written Burmese dates to the early Pagan period. Burmese orthography originally followed a square block format, but the cursive format took hold from the 17th century when increased literacy and the resulting explosion of Burmese literature led to the wider use of palm leaves and folded paper known as &quot;parabaiks&quot; ().

== Grammar ==
The basic word order of the Burmese language is subject-object-verb. Pronouns in Burmese vary according to the gender and status of the audience, although pronouns are often omitted. Affixes are used to convey information. Verbs are almost always suffixed and nouns declined.

===Case affixes===

Burmese is an agglutinative language with an extensive case system in which nouns are suffixed to determine their syntactic function in a sentence or clause. Sometimes the case markers are different between the two registers.

The case markers are:
=== Adjectives ===
Burmese does not have adjectives per se. Rather, it has verbs that carry the meaning &quot;to be X&quot;, where X is an English adjective. These verbs can modify a noun by means of the suffix &quot;tai.&quot; in colloquial Burmese (literary form: &quot;sau:&quot; ), which is suffixed as follows:

Adjectives may also form a compound with the noun (e.g. &quot;lu hkyau:&quot; &#x27;person&#x27; + &#x27;be beautiful&#x27;).

Comparatives are usually ordered: X + &quot;htak pui&quot; + adjective, where X is the object being compared to. Superlatives are indicated with the prefix &quot;a.&quot; + adjective + &quot;hcum:&quot; .

=== Verbs ===
The roots of Burmese verbs almost always have affixes which convey information like tense, aspect, intention, politeness, mood, etc. Many of these affixes also have formal/literary and colloquial equivalents. In fact, the only time in which no suffix is attached to a verb is in imperative commands.

The most commonly used verb affixes and their usage are shown below with an example verb root &quot;ca:&quot; (&#x27;to eat&#x27;). Alone, the statement is imperative.

The affix &quot;tai&quot; (literary form: &quot;sany&quot; ) can be viewed as an affix marking the present tense and/or a factual statement:

The affix &quot;hkai.&quot; denotes that the action took place in the past. However, this affix is not always necessary to indicate the past tense such that it can convey the same information without it. But to emphasize that the action happened before another event that is also currently being discussed, the affix becomes imperative. The affix &quot;tai&quot; in this case denotes a factual statement rather than the present tense:

The affix &quot;ne&quot; is used to denote an action in progression. It is equivalent to the English &#x27;-ing&#x27;.

This affix &quot;pri&quot; , which is used when an action that had been expected to be performed by the subject is now finally being performed, has no equivalent in English. So in the above example, if someone had been expecting the subject to eat, and the subject has finally started eating, the affix is used as follows:

The affix &quot;mai&quot; (literary form: &quot;many&quot; ) is used to indicate the future tense or an action which is yet to be performed:

The affix &quot;tau.&quot; is used when the action is about to be performed immediately when used in conjunction with . Therefore, it could be termed as the &quot;immediate future tense suffix&quot;.

When is used alone, however, it is imperative:

Verbs are negated by the prefix &quot;ma.&quot; . Generally speaking, there are other suffixes on verb, along with .

The verb suffix &quot;nai.&quot; (literary form: &quot;hnang.&quot; ) indicates a command:

The verb suffix &quot;bhu:&quot; indicates a statement:

=== Nouns ===
Nouns in Burmese are pluralized by suffixing &quot;twe&quot; (or if the word ends in a glottal stop) in colloquial Burmese or &quot;mya:&quot; in formal Burmese. The suffix &quot;tou.&quot; , which indicates a group of persons or things, is also suffixed to the modified noun. An example is below:

Plural suffixes are not used when the noun is quantified with a number.

Although Burmese does not have grammatical gender (e.g. masculine or feminine nouns), a distinction is made between the sexes, especially in animals and plants, by means of suffix particles. Nouns are masculinized with the following suffixes: &quot;hti:&quot; , &quot;hpa&quot; , or &quot;hpui&quot; , depending on the noun, and feminized with the suffix &quot;ma.&quot; . Examples of usage are below:
* &quot;kraung hti:&quot; &quot;male cat&quot;
* &quot;kraung ma.&quot; &quot;female cat&quot;
* &quot;krak hpa.&quot; &quot;rooster/cock&quot;
* &quot;htan: hpui&quot; &quot;male toddy palm plant&quot;

==== Numerical classifiers ====

Burmese uses numerical classifiers (also called measure words) when nouns are counted or quantified. This is similar to neighbouring languages like Thai, Bengali, and Chinese. This approximately equates to English expressions such as &quot;two slices of bread&quot; or &quot;a cup of coffee&quot;. Classifiers are required when counting nouns, so &quot;hka.le: nga:&quot; () is incorrect, since the measure word for people &quot;yauk&quot; is missing; it needs to suffix the numeral.

The standard word order of quantified words is: quantified noun + numeral adjective + classifier, except in round numbers (numbers that end in zero), in which the word order is flipped, where the quantified noun precedes the classifier: quantified noun + classifier + numeral adjective. The only exception to this rule is the number 10, which follows the standard word order.

Measurements of time, such as &quot;hour&quot;, &quot;day&quot;, or &quot;month&quot;, do not require classifiers.

Below are some of the most commonly used classifiers in Burmese.

=== Affixes ===
The Burmese language makes prominent usage of affixes (called in Burmese), which are untranslatable words that are suffixed or prefixed to words to indicate tense, aspect, case, formality etc. For example, is a suffix used to indicate the imperative mood. While (&#x27;work&#x27; + suffix indicating politeness) does not indicate the imperative, (&#x27;work&#x27; + suffix indicating imperative mood + suffix indicating politeness) does. Affixes are often stacked next to each other

Some affixes modify the word&#x27;s part of speech. Among the most prominent of these is the prefix , which is prefixed to verbs and adjectives to form nouns or adverbs. For instance, the word means &quot;to enter&quot;, but combined with , it means &quot;entrance&quot; . Moreover, in colloquial Burmese, there is a tendency to omit the second in words that follow the pattern + noun/adverb + + noun/adverb, like , which is pronounced and formally pronounced .

=== Pronouns ===

Burmese exhibits pronoun avoidance, where pronouns are avoided for politeness. In Burmese, speakers account for social distinctions linguistically, reflecting gender, relative age, kinship, social status, and intimacy. Burmese uses &quot;negative politeness,&quot; whereby speakers avoid directly addressing people. Instead, Burmese relies on status and kinship terms, titles, personal names, and other terms of address, rather than regular pronouns. Burmese kinship terms are commonly substituted as pronouns. For example, an older person may use &quot;dau le:&quot; (&#x27;aunt&#x27;) or &quot;u: lei:&quot; (&#x27;uncle&#x27;) to refer to himself, while a younger person may use either &quot;sa:&quot; (&#x27;son&#x27;) or &quot;sa.mi:&quot; (&#x27;daughter&#x27;).

Burmese has developed an elaborate hierarchical system of pronouns that are grammatically underspecified, but highly marked for the complex relation between speaker and addressee according to their relative position in the society. In Burmese, the polite forms of first-person pronouns (&quot;kya. nau&quot; , ) for males, and (&quot;kya. ma.&quot; , ) for females humble the speaker, while the polite forms of second-person pronouns (&quot;min&quot; ; ), (&quot;khang bya:&quot; ; ) or (&quot;hrang&quot; ; ) elevate the addressee. The original pronouns &quot;nga&quot; (&#x27;I/me&#x27;) and &quot;nang&quot; (&#x27;you&#x27;) have been relegated to use with people of higher or equivalent status, although most speakers prefer to use third person pronouns.

Burmese also uses case markers to mark subject pronouns ( in colloquial, in formal) and object pronouns ( in colloquial, in formal), although these are generally dropped in spoken Burmese.

The basic pronouns are:
:* The basic particle to indicate plurality is &quot;tui.&quot;, colloquial &quot;dui.&quot;.
:‡ Used by male speakers.
:† Used by female speakers.

Other pronouns are reserved for speaking with bhikkhus (Buddhist monks). When speaking to a bhikkhu, pronouns like &quot;bhun: bhun:&quot; (from &quot;phun: kri:&quot; &#x27;monk&#x27;), &quot;chara dau&quot; (&#x27;royal teacher&#x27;), and &quot;a.hrang bhu.ra:&quot; (&#x27;your lordship&#x27;) are used depending on their status . When referring to oneself, terms like &quot;ta. pany. tau&quot; (&#x27;royal disciple&#x27;) or &quot;da. ka&quot; , (&#x27;donor&#x27;) are used. When speaking to a monk, the following pronouns are used:
:† The particle &quot;ma.&quot; is suffixed for women.
:‡ Typically reserved for the chief monk of a kyaung (monastery).

=== Kinship terms ===

Kinship terms vary across Burmese dialects. Upper Burmese dialects still differentiate maternal and paternal sides of a family, unlike Lower Burmese dialects:
1 The youngest (paternal or maternal) aunt may be called , and the youngest paternal uncle .

In a testament to the power of media, the Yangon-based speech is gaining currency even in Upper Burma. Upper Burmese-specific usage, while historically and technically accurate, is increasingly viewed as distinctly rural or regional speech. In fact, some usages are already considered strictly regional Upper Burmese speech and are likely to die out. For example:
In general, the male-centric names of old Burmese for familial terms have been replaced in standard Burmese with formerly female-centric terms, which are now used by both sexes. One holdover is the use of (&#x27;younger brother to a male&#x27;) and (&#x27;younger brother to a female&#x27;). Terms like (&#x27;elder brother to a male&#x27;) and (&#x27;younger sister to a male&#x27;) now are used in standard Burmese only as part of compound words like (&#x27;brothers&#x27;) or (&#x27;brother and sister&#x27;).

=== Reduplication ===
Reduplication is prevalent in Burmese and is used to intensify or weaken adjectives&#x27; meanings. For example, if &quot;beautiful&quot; is reduplicated, then the intensity of the adjective&#x27;s meaning increases. Many Burmese words, especially adjectives with two syllables, such as &quot;beautiful&quot;, when reduplicated ( → ) become adverbs. This is also true of some Burmese verbs and nouns (e.g. &#x27;a moment&#x27; → &#x27;frequently&#x27;), which become adverbs when reduplicated.

Some nouns are also reduplicated to indicate plurality. For instance, (&#x27;country&#x27;), but when reduplicated to , it means &quot;many countries&quot;, as in (&#x27;international&#x27;). Another example is , which means &quot;a kind&quot;, but the reduplicated form means &quot;multiple kinds&quot;.

A few measure words can also be reduplicated to indicate &quot;one or the other&quot;:
* (measure word for people) → (&#x27;someone&#x27;)
* (measure word for things) → (&#x27;something&#x27;)

==Numerals==

Burmese digits are traditionally written using a set of numerals unique to the Mon–Burmese script, although Arabic numerals are also used in informal contexts. The cardinal forms of Burmese numerals are primarily inherited from the Proto-Sino-Tibetan language, with cognates with modern-day Sino-Tibetan languages, including the Chinese and Tibetan. Numerals beyond &#x27;ten million&#x27; are borrowed from Indic languages like Sanskrit or Pali. Similarly, the ordinal forms of primary Burmese numerals (i.e., from first to tenth) are directly borrowed from Pali. Ordinal numbers beyond ten are suffixed ().

Burmese numerals follow the nouns they modify, with the exception of round numbers, which precede the nouns they modify. Moreover, numerals are subject to several tone sandhi and voicing rules that involve tone changes (low tone → creaky tone) and voicing shifts depending on the pronunciation of surrounding words. A more thorough explanation is found on Burmese numerals.

== Romanization and transcription ==

There is no official romanization system for Burmese. There have been attempts to make one, but none have been successful. Replicating Burmese sounds in the Latin script is complicated. There is a Pali-based transcription system in existence, MLC Transcription System which was devised by the Myanmar Language Commission (MLC). However, it only transcribes sounds in formal Burmese and is based on the Burmese alphabet rather than the phonology.

Several colloquial transcription systems have been proposed, but none is overwhelmingly preferred over others.

Transcription of Burmese is not standardized, as seen in the varying English transcriptions of Burmese names. For instance, a Burmese personal name like may be variously romanized as Win, Winn, Wyn, or Wynn, while may be romanized as Khaing, Khine, or Khain.

== Computer fonts and standard keyboard layout ==
The Burmese alphabet can be entered from a standard QWERTY keyboard and is supported within the Unicode standard, meaning it can be read and written from most modern computers and smartphones.

Burmese has complex character rendering requirements, where tone markings and vowel modifications are noted using diacritics. These can be placed before consonants (as with ), above them (as with ) or even around them (as with ). These character clusters are built using multiple keystrokes. In particular, the inconsistent placement of diacritics as a feature of the language presents a conflict between an intuitive WYSIWYG typing approach, and a logical consonant-first storage approach.

Since its introduction in 2007, the most popular Burmese font, Zawgyi, has been near-ubiquitous in Myanmar. Linguist Justin Watkins argues that the ubiquitous use of Zawgyi harms Myanmar languages, including Burmese, by preventing efficient sorting, searching, processing and analyzing Myanmar text through flexible diacritic ordering.

Zawgyi is not Unicode-compliant, but occupies the same code space as Unicode Myanmar font. As it is not defined as a standard character encoding, Zawgyi is not built in to any major operating systems as standard. However, allow for its position as the &quot;de facto&quot; (but largely undocumented) standard within the country, telcos and major smartphone distributors (such as Huawei and Samsung) ship phones with Zawgyi font overwriting standard Unicode-compliant fonts, which are installed on most internationally distributed hardware. Facebook also supports Zawgyi as an additional language encoding for their app and website. As a result, almost all SMS alerts (including those from telcos to their customers), social media posts and other web resources may be incomprehensible on these devices without the custom Zawgyi font installed at the operating system level. These may include devices purchased overseas, or distributed by companies who do not customize software for the local market.

Keyboards which have a Zawgyi keyboard layout printed on them are the most commonly available for purchase domestically.

Until recently, Unicode compliant fonts have been more difficult to type than Zawgyi, as they have a stricter, less forgiving and arguably less intuitive method for ordering diacritics. However, intelligent input software such as Keymagic and recent versions of smartphone soft-keyboards including Gboard and ttKeyboard allow for more forgiving input sequences and Zawgyi keyboard layouts which produce Unicode-compliant text.

A number of Unicode-compliant Burmese fonts exist. The national standard keyboard layout is known as the Myanmar3 layout, and it was published along with the Myanmar3 Unicode font. The layout, developed by the Myanmar Unicode and NLP Research Center, has a smart input system to cover the complex structures of Burmese and related scripts.

In addition to the development of computer fonts and standard keyboard layout, there is still a lot of scope of research for the Burmese language, specifically for Natural Language Processing (NLP) areas like WordNet, Search Engine, development of parallel corpus for Burmese language as well as development of a formally standardized and dense domain-specific corpus of the Burmese language.

The Myanmar government has designated 1 October 2019 as &quot;U-Day&quot; to officially switch to Unicode. The full transition is estimated to take two years.

== Example text ==
Article 1 of the &quot;Universal Declaration of Human Rights&quot; in Burmese:The romanization of the text into the Latin alphabet:Article 1 of the &quot;Universal Declaration of Human Rights&quot; in English:All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.

<text>James Beaton (or Bethune) (1473–1539) was a Roman Catholic Scottish church leader, the uncle of David Cardinal Beaton and the Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland.

==Life==

James Beaton was the sixth and youngest son of John Beaton of Balfour, in Fife. He graduated as Master of Arts at St. Andrews University in 1493, was appointed Precentor of Dornoch Cathedral (Diocese of Caithness) in 1497 and in 1503 was appointed Provost of the Collegiate Church of Bothwell. In 1504 he became Prior of Whithorn and Abbot of Dunfermline and in 1505 was made Lord High Treasurer of Scotland by James IV.

In 1508 he was elected as Bishop of Galloway, in succession to George Vaus, but before his consecration he was chosen to succeed Robert Blackadder as Archbishop of Glasgow and was consecrated at Stirling on 15 April 1509. With the archbishopric he held the commendatory Abbeys of Arbroath and Kilwinning, and in 1515 he became Lord Chancellor of Scotland. King James V was at this time a child and Beaton, as one of the Council of Regency, was one of the most important people in the kingdom during the minority of the young king.

In 1522 Beaton was transferred to St. Andrews bishopric, vacant by the death of Archbishop Forman. As primate he threw all his powerful influence into the scale against the intrigues of Henry VIII to obtain predominance in Scotland. 
He was chiefly responsible for the king&#x27;s action in allying himself with France and not with England. The English ambassador described him as &quot;greatest man both of lands and experience within this realm, and noted to be very crafty and dissimulating&quot;.

His residence in the capital, Edinburgh, was at the foot of Blackfriars Wynd on the Cowgate. This had a courtyard form and the coat-of-arms of the Bethune family over the entrance.

In 1528 he ordered Patrick Hamilton burned at the stake for the alleged heresy of Lutheranism. The Regent Albany&#x27;s jealousy had deprived Beaton of the chancellorship some years previously, and he was never reappointed, though he enjoyed the full favour of the king. A few months after the second marriage of James to Mary of Guise, the primate got his nephew Cardinal Beaton appointed his coadjutor with right of succession. Archbishop James Beaton died in the autumn of 1539 in his castle at St. Andrews.

<text>Kronach is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the east and clockwise) the districts of Hof, Kulmbach, Lichtenfels and Coburg, and the state of Thuringia (districts of Sonneberg, Saalfeld-Rudolstadt and Saale-Orla).

==History==

Kronach was ruled by the bishopric of Bamberg from 1102 until 1803, when the clerical states of Germany were dissolved. Afterwards it fell to Bavaria, where the districts of Kronach and Teuschnitz were established on the territory of the present district. In 1931, these districts were merged to form the district of Kronach.

==Geography==

A large portion of the district is part of the Franconian Forest nature park. The Franconian Forest (German &quot;Frankenwald&quot;) is a hill chain rising to To the southwest the country is sloping away. Several narrow rivers run southwards through the district in order to join the river Main beyond the district&#x27;s borders, among them the Kronach.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms displays:
* the heraldic lion of Bamberg
* the heraldic lion of Orlamünde (a Thuringian family owning Lauenstein castle in the very north of the district)
* the wheel symbolising watermills in the rivers of the district

<doc id="338228" wikidata="Q16526" url="?curid=338228" title="Hieracium">
<text>Hieracium (),
known by the common name hawkweed and classically as  (from ancient Greek ἱέραξ, &#x27;hawk&#x27;), 
is a genus of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae, and closely related to dandelion (&quot;Taraxacum&quot;), chicory (&quot;Cichorium&quot;), prickly lettuce (&quot;Lactuca&quot;) and sow thistle (&quot;Sonchus&quot;),
which are part of the tribe Cichorieae. Hawkweeds, with their 10,000+ recorded species and subspecies, do their part to make Asteraceae the second largest family of flowering plants.
Some botanists group all these species or subspecies into approximately 800 accepted species, while others prefer to accept several thousand species. Since most hawkweeds reproduce exclusively asexually by means of seeds that are genetically identical to their mother plant (apomixis or agamospermy), clones or populations that consist of genetically identical plants are formed and some botanists (especially in UK, Scandinavia and Russia) prefer to accept these clones as good species (arguing that it is impossible to know how these clones are interrelated) whereas others (mainly in Central Europe and USA) try to group them into a few hundred more broadly defined species. What is here treated as the single genus &quot;Hieracium&quot; is now treated by most European experts as two different genera, &quot;Hieracium&quot; and &quot;Pilosella&quot;, with species such as &quot;Hieracium pilosella&quot;, &quot;Hieracium floribundum&quot; and &quot;Hieracium aurantiacum&quot; referred to the latter genus. Many members of the genus &quot;Pilosella&quot; reproduce both by stolons (runners like those of strawberries) and by seeds, whereas true &quot;Hieracium&quot; species reproduce only by seeds. In &quot;Pilosella&quot;, many individual plants are capable of forming both normal sexual and asexual (apomictic) seeds, whereas individual plants of &quot;Hieracium&quot; only produce one kind of seeds. Another difference is that all species of &quot;Pilosella&quot; have leaves with smooth (entire) margins whereas most species of &quot;Hieracium&quot; have distinctly dentate to deeply cut or divided leaves.

==Description==

===Flowers and flower-heads===
&quot;Hieracium&quot; or hawkweeds, like others in the family Asteraceae, mostly have yellow, 
tightly packed flower-heads of numerous small flowers
but, unlike daisies and sunflowers in the same family, they have not two kinds of florets but only strap-shaped (spatulate) florets, each one of which is a complete flower in itself, not lacking stamens,
and joined to the stem by leafy bracts. As in other members of the tribe Cichorieae, each ray corolla is tipped by 3 to 5 teeth.

===Bracts, stems and leaves===
Erect single, glabrous or hairy stems, sometimes branched away from the point of attachment, sometimes branched throughout.

The hairiness of hawkweeds can be very complex: from surfaces with scattered to crowded, tapered, whiplike, straight or curly, smooth to setae; &quot;stellate-pubescent&quot; or surfaces with scattered to crowded, branched (often called, but seldom truly, &quot;stellate&quot;) hairs; and &quot;stipitate-glandular&quot; or surfaces with scattered to crowded gland-tipped hairs mostly. Surfaces of stems, leaves, peduncles, and phyllaries may be glabrous or may bear one, two, or all three of the types of hairs mentioned above.

Like the other members of the Chicory tribe, hawkweeds contain a milky latex.

==Ecology==
The large yellow underwing moth (&quot;Noctua pronuba&quot;) feeds on &quot;Hieracium&quot; species.

==Distribution==
&quot;Hieracium&quot; species are native to Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Central America and South America.

==Species==

The classification of &quot;Hieracium&quot; into species is notoriously difficult. One reason is the apomictic reproduction (in which plants asexually produce seeds), which tends to produce a lot of minor geographical variation. Over 9000 species names have been published in &quot;Hieracium&quot; but some botanists regard many of those as synonyms of larger species.

===Europe===
*&quot;Hieracium attenboroughianum&quot; – Attenborough’s hawkweed
*&quot;Hieracium bakerianum&quot;
*&quot;Hieracium hethlandiae&quot; – Cliva Hill hawkweed
*&quot;Hieracium lepidulum&quot; Stenstr. ex Dahlst. – tussock hawkweed

==Plant pest==
All species of the genus &quot;Hieracium&quot; are classed as invasive species throughout New Zealand. They are banned from sale, propagation and distribution under the National Pest Plant Accord. &quot;Hieracium&quot; is a pasture weed that reduces available feed for livestock and displaces the indigenous plants. It is a particular threat in alpine ecosystems previously dominated by native tussocks, though it will colonise habitats from bare ground, to exotic pine forest, to native Southern Beech forest.

In the United States, many species of &quot;Hieracium&quot; have been introduced and all species present are considered noxious weeds in one or more states.

In Australia, hawkweeds are invasive pests in alpine regions, all species of &quot;Hieracium&quot; are listed or declared under various State Acts.

<text>William Taylor (7 November 1765 – 5 March 1836), often called William Taylor of Norwich, was a British essayist, scholar and polyglot. He is most notable as a supporter and translator of German romantic literature.

==Early life==
He was born in Norwich, Norfolk, England on 7 November 1765, the only child of William Taylor (died 1819), a wealthy Norwich merchant with European trade connections, by his wife Sarah (died 1811), second daughter of John Wright of Diss, Norfolk. William Taylor was taught Latin, French and Dutch by John Bruckner, pastor of the French and Dutch Protestant churches in Norwich, in preparation for continuing his father&#x27;s continental trading in textiles. In 1774 he was transferred to Palgrave Academy, Suffolk, by Rochemont Barbauld, whose wife Anna Letitia Barbauld Taylor regarded as a strong influence. For three years his school companion was Frank Sayers, who was to be a lifelong friend.

In August 1779 his father took him from school. During the next three years he spent much of his time abroad. Firstly he visited the Netherlands, France, and Italy, learning languages and business methods. In 1781, he left home again, and spent a year in Detmold, staying with an Alsatian Protestant pastor called Roederer, and absorbing German literature under the influence of . Roederer gave him introductions to August Ludwig von Schlözer the historian at Göttingen, and to Goethe at Weimar. After further German travels he returned to Norwich on 17 November 1782.

==Intellectual and political radical==
Taylor was a Unitarian who attended the Octagon Chapel, Norwich. He became the leading figure of Norwich&#x27;s literary circles, and a political radical. He applauded the French Revolution and argued for universal suffrage and the end of all governmental intervention in the affairs of religion. He wrote in the 18th century tradition of liberal and latitudinarian criticism of the Bible (which Sayers thought heretical, at least in part). In the period 1793 to 1799 he wrote over 200 reviews in periodicals, following his concept of &quot;philosophical criticism&quot;.

From 1783 Taylor was engaged in his father&#x27;s business. In May and June 1784 he was in Scotland with Sayers, who had begun medical studies at Edinburgh; there he met James Mackintosh. A second journey to Edinburgh in 1788 followed a breakdown in Sayers&#x27; health.

In November 1789 Taylor&#x27;s father was made secretary of a Revolution Society in Norwich, formed to commemorate the Glorious Revolution of 1688. In May 1790 Taylor made a visit to France, and spent time at the National Assembly. He returned somewhat sceptical whether its members&#x27; rhetoric matched their intentions, but translated a number of its decrees for the Revolution Society. Before the end of 1790 two new clubs were formed in Norwich, of which Taylor became a member, the &quot;Tusculan School&quot; for political discussion, and the Speculative Society, founded by William Enfield for philosophical debate. Taylor became a leader of the Speculative Club. It lasted to 1797, dissolving after Enfield died.

Around this point in time, Taylor persuaded his father to retire on his fortune. The firm was dissolved in 1791; his father employed part of his capital in underwriting, not very successfully. Taylor resisted his father&#x27;s wish to put him into a London bank. William Taylor senior gave up his position as secretary to the Revolution Society by early 1792. In May 1794 government repression of radicals meant the Norwich Revolution Society closed down officially; and Taylor added &quot;junior&quot; to its written records, wherever his father&#x27;s name appeared.

In late 1794 a Norwich periodical, &quot;The Cabinet&quot;, was set up, publishing articles taking an anti-government view. It was supposed to be the work of a &quot;Society of Gentlemen&quot;, the group behind it being closely related to the Tusculan School, which dissolved or went underground in mid-1794: it was edited by Charles Marsh, and Taylor contributed, along with other like-minded young radicals, such as Thomas Starling Norgate and Amelia Alderson. They had tacit support from older citizens, including Enfield and Edward Rigby. It appeared for a year from September 1794, proposing in fact a tame and moderate intellectual line.

==Reputation==
Taylor was nicknamed &quot;godless Billy&quot; for his radical views by Harriet Martineau. Martineau, born in 1802, was a child when Taylor was in his intellectual prime. Thirty-three years junior to Taylor, she petulantly said of him:

:&quot;his habits of intemperance kept him out of the sight of ladies, and he got round him a set of ignorant and conceited young men, who thought they could set the whole world right by their destructive propensities&quot;.

David Chandler writes in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; that Taylor was probably homosexual.

==Later life==
Taylor&#x27;s friendship with Robert Southey began early in 1798, when Southey, having placed his brother Henry Herbert Southey with George Burnett at Great Yarmouth, visited Norwich as Taylor&#x27;s guest; Southey revisited him at Norwich in February 1802. Much of their correspondence to 1821 is given by John Warden Robberds in his &quot;Memoir&quot; of Taylor; it is frank on both sides.

In 1802, during the Peace of Amiens, Taylor embarked on another tour of Europe, visiting France, Italy and Germany, partly on business; Henry Southey joined him at Paris. He stayed with Lafayette at Lagrange, where he met Frances d&#x27;Arblay. In Paris he met Thomas Holcroft, Thomas Paine, and Thomas Manning.

From 1811 American and other business losses made money tight. Taylor applied in 1812, at Southey&#x27;s suggestion, for the post of keeper of manuscripts in the British Museum, on the resignation of Francis Douce; but the vacancy was already filled.
Unmarried, Taylor lived with his parents. He had a daily routine of studying in the morning, walking in the afternoon followed by bathing in the River Wensum, from a bath house upstream from the city and its pollution. In the evening he liked to socialise, drink (heavily) and discuss linguistics, literature and philosophy in society.

==Works==
Three early poetic translations from German brought him to notice. Georg Herzfeld wrongly assigned to him the political song, &quot;The Trumpet of Liberty&quot;, first published in the &quot;Norfolk Chronicle&quot; on 16 July 1791, having been sung on 14 July at a dinner commemorating the fall of the Bastille; Edward Taylor claimed it for his father, John Taylor, of the unrelated Norwich family. William Taylor&#x27;s name was made by his translation of Gottfried August Bürger&#x27;s &quot;Lenore&quot; into English ballad metre. This was written in 1790, and bore the title &quot;Lenora&quot;; sent it to his friend Benzler from Detmold (then in Wernigerode); a previous version had been made in 1782 by Henry James Pye, but was not published till 1795, and was unknown to Taylor. The translation, circulated in manuscript, was made the foundation of a ballad (1791) by John Aikin, and was read by Anna Barbauld in 1794 at a literary gathering in the house of Dugald Stewart in Edinburgh. Stewart&#x27;s brother-in-law, George Cranstoun (Lord Corehouse) gave his recollection of it to Walter Scott, who produced his own version (1796) of the poem, entitled &quot;William and Helen&quot;. The announcement of the almost simultaneous publication of Scott&#x27;s version and three others had led Taylor to publish his in the &quot;Monthly Magazine&quot; in March 1796; he then published it separately as &quot;Ellenore&quot;, revised with some input from the version by William Robert Spencer.

To 1790 belong also his translations of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing&#x27;s &quot;Nathan the Wise&quot; and Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Iphigenia in Tauris&quot;. The former was first published in 1805. The &quot;Iphigenia&quot; was submitted to Benzler before September 1790, but was not printed till 1793 (for private distribution); and published 1794. In 1795 Taylor sent a copy to Goethe, through Benzler. A volume of Christoph Martin Wieland&#x27;s &#x27;Dialogues of the Gods,’ 1795, contained four dialogues; five more dialogues were included in his &#x27;Historic Survey&#x27; (1828–30).

Taylor&#x27;s career as a prolific literary critic began in April 1793 with an article in the &quot;Monthly Review&quot; on his friend Frank Sayers&#x27;s &quot;Disquisitions&quot;. To this review (with a break, 1800–1809) he contributed till 1824; to the &quot;Monthly Magazine&quot; from its start till 1824; to the &quot;Annual Review&quot; from 1802 to 1807; to the &quot;Critical Review&quot;, 1803–4 and 1809; to the &quot;Athenæum&quot;, 1807–8, making a total of 1754 articles. He wrote also for the &quot;Cambridge Intelligencer&quot;, conducted by Benjamin Flower, from 20 July 1793 to 18 June 1803, and was concerned in two short-lived Norwich magazines, the &quot;Cabinet&quot; (October 1794–5), issued in conjunction with Sayers, and the &quot;Iris&quot; (5 February 1803 – 29 January 1804), to which Robert Southey was a contributor. To the &quot;Foreign Quarterly&quot; (1827) he contributed one article. His friends teased him on the peculiarities of his diction, which James Mackintosh styled the Taylorian language: he coined words such as &#x27;transversion,’ &#x27;body-spirit,’ and &#x27;Sternholdianism&#x27;. Some of his terms, ruled out by the editor of the &quot;Monthly Review&quot; as &#x27;not English,’ have since become accepted —for instance, &#x27;rehabilitated.&#x27; He forecast steam navigation (1804); advised the formation of colonies in Africa (1805); and projected the Panama Canal (1824).

Taylor suggested to Southey the publication of an annual collection of verse, on the plan of the &quot;Almanach des Muses&quot;, and contributed to both volumes of this &quot;Annual Anthology&quot; (1799–1800), using the signatures &#x27;Ryalto&#x27; (an anagram) and &#x27;R. O.&#x27; To the second volume he contributed specimens of English hexameters, which he had first attempted in the &quot;Monthly Magazine&quot;, 1796. As editor of &quot;A Voyage to the Demerary&quot; (1807) by Henry Bolingbroke, he expressed himself in favour of a regulated slave trade.

His family financial affairs were not prospering, and he wrote more for money. His &#x27;Tales of Yore,’ 1810, 3 vols. (anon.), was a collection of prose translations from French and German, begun in 1807. On the basis of his magazine articles he issued his &#x27;English Synonyms Described,’ 1813, a work from which his old schoolfellow George Crabb borrowed much (1824) without specific acknowledgment; it was reissued in 1850 and subsequently; a German translation appeared in 1851. In 1823 he edited the works of his friend Sayers, prefixing an elaborate biography.

His major work, the &#x27;Historic Survey of German Poetry,’ 1828–30, 3 vols., was behind the times. It is a patchwork of previous articles and translations, with digressions. His last publication was a &#x27;Memoir,’ 1831, of Philip Meadows Martineau, a Norwich surgeon, written in conjunction with F. Elwes.

==Influence==
William Taylor was England&#x27;s first advocate of and enthusiast for German Romantic literature, and leader in its assimilation until the return of Coleridge from Germany in 1799. English writers were indebted to his enthusiastic if free translations. In 1828 the author Thomas Carlyle reminded Goethe that:

:&quot;A Mr.Taylor of Norwich who is at present publishing &#x27;Specimens of German Poetry&#x27;, is a man of learning and long ago gave a version of your &quot;Iphigenie auf Tauris&quot; (&quot;Iphigenia in Tauris&quot;)&quot;

Taylor is depicted as a mentor in George Borrow&#x27;s semi-autobiographical novel &quot;Lavengro&quot;. Borrow described his philological teacher as:

:&quot; the Anglo-German... a real character, the founder of the Anglo-German school in England, and the cleverest Englishman who ever talked or wrote encomiastic nonsense about Germany and the Germans&quot;. (&quot;Romany Rye&quot;)

<text>The A7 is a major road, partly a trunk road, that connects Edinburgh in Central Scotland to Carlisle in North West England. The A7 meets the M6 motorway close to Carlisle, which connects to the English motorway network.

==Route description==

===Edinburgh to Hawick===

The northern terminus of the A7 is the junction at North Bridge with Princes Street in Edinburgh, also the northern terminus of the A1 and the southern terminus of the A900. The road passes Cameron Toll, before meeting the Edinburgh City Bypass at the Sheriffhall Roundabout. South of the bypass, the A7 continues through Midlothian past Newtongrange and Gorebridge. Continuing from Midlothian into the Scottish Borders, the road bypasses Heriot then passes through Stow to reach Galashiels. The A7 becomes a trunk road at the southern boundary of Galashiels. It continues south to Selkirk; a bypass here has been proposed for years but not implemented. This section of the A7 runs parallel to the Borders Railway which opened in 2015; Network Rail and MPs met during construction to mitigate the effect of works traffic on the road.

===Hawick to Langholm===

In Hawick the A7 continues along the north bank of the River Teviot to cross the river at the Albert Bridge and follows the south bank of the river towards Langholm, then bypasses Canonbie. South of Langholm the road has been improved, allowing for overtaking.

===England===

Continuing across the English border, the A7 goes through Longtown, before meeting the A689 and the M6 at the Greymoorhill Roundabout. The A7 becomes a dual carriageway close to the Kingstown Industrial Estate on the northern fringe of Carlisle. Continuing as a single carriageway road, the A7 crosses the River Eden over Eden Bridge. At Hardwicke Circus Roundabout in the centre of Carlisle, the A7 meets the A595 to the west and southern Cumbria, then continues to form part of Carlisle&#x27;s one way system through the city centre, meeting the A69 and finally becoming the A6 near Carlisle railway station. The English section was detrunked in 2005.

==Safety==
In the late 1970s, the A7 was described as being slow and tortuous. It was the 28th most dangerous UK road in 2017. The A7 Action Group was founded in 1990, and continues to lobby for safety improvements to the road, including a bypass of Selkirk.

==Major junctions==
Note: Junctions are listed northbound from Carlisle to Edinburgh.

<text>Johann Nepomuk Karl Maria Rott (1 August 1858 – 25 June 1884) was an Austrian composer and organist. His music is little-known today, though he received high praise in his time from Gustav Mahler and Anton Bruckner. He left a symphony and &quot;Lieder&quot;, among other works.

==Life==

Rott was born in Braunhirschengrund, a suburb of Vienna. His mother Maria Rosalia (1840–1872; née Lutz) was an actress and singer. His father Carl Mathias Rott, who married her in 1862 (born 1807; né Roth), was a famous comic actor in Vienna who was crippled in 1874 by a stage accident which led to his death two years later.

===Studies===
Hans was left alone to continue his studies at the Conservatory. Fortunately, both his skill and financial need were recognized and he was excused from paying tuition. While studying, he briefly roomed with Gustav Mahler and . He studied piano with Leopold Landskron and Josef Dachs, harmony with Hermann Graedener, counterpoint and composition—like Mahler—with Franz Krenn.

He studied organ with Bruckner, starting in 1874, and graduating from Bruckner&#x27;s organ class in 1877, with honors. Bruckner said that Rott played Bach very well, and even improvised wonderfully (a high compliment since Bruckner himself was a great improviser). Rott was also influenced by the works of Wagner; he attended the very first Bayreuth Festival in 1876.

===Compositions===
During that time Rott was also organist at the Piarist church &quot;Maria Treu&quot; in Vienna. For the final year of his studies in 1878, Rott submitted the first movement of his Symphony in E major to a composition contest. The jury, except for Bruckner, was very derisive about the work. After completing the Symphony in 1880, Rott showed the work to both Brahms and Hans Richter, in order to get it played. His efforts failed. Brahms did not like the fact that Bruckner exerted great influence on the Conservatory students, and even told Rott that he had no talent whatsoever and that he should give up music. Unfortunately, Rott lacked Mahler&#x27;s inner resolve, and whereas Mahler was able to overcome many of the obstacles in his life, Rott was brought down by mental illness.
The symphony has been recorded by the Deutsche Grammophon, BIS, CPO, Acousence, Hyperion, Ondine, RCA, Arte Nova, &amp; Oehms record labels. Hans Rott also wrote a Symphony for String Orchestra in A flat major, in three movements, (1874–75), and a String Quartet in C minor, a student work in five movements. They have both been recorded on the Acousence Records label #ACO-CD 20205 (2005).

===Final years===
Rott began to evidence persecutory delusions. In October 1880, while on a train journey, he reportedly threatened another passenger with a revolver, claiming that Brahms had filled the train with dynamite.
Rott was committed to a mental hospital in 1881, where despite a brief recovery he sank into depression. By the end of 1883 a diagnosis recorded &quot;hallucinatory insanity, persecution mania—recovery no longer to be expected.&quot; He died of tuberculosis in 1884, aged 25. Many well-wishers, including Bruckner and Mahler, attended Rott&#x27;s funeral at the Zentralfriedhof in Vienna.

==Legacy==
Mahler wrote of Rott a musician of genius ... who died unrecognized and in want on the very threshold of his career. ... What music has lost in him cannot be estimated. Such is the height to which his genius soars in ... [his] &quot;Symphony [in E major]&quot;, which he wrote as 20-year-old youth and makes him ... the Founder of the New Symphony as I see it. To be sure, what he wanted is not quite what he achieved. … But I know where he aims. Indeed, he is so near to my inmost self that he and I seem to me like two fruits from the same tree which the same soil has produced and the same air nourished. He could have meant infinitely much to me and perhaps the two of us would have well-nigh exhausted the content of new time which was breaking out for music.

Thanks to Rott&#x27;s friends, some of his music manuscripts have survived in the music collection of Vienna&#x27;s national library. This includes Rott&#x27;s &quot;Symphony in E major&quot;, and sketches for a second Symphony that was never finished. The completed symphony is remarkable in the way it anticipates some of Mahler&#x27;s musical characteristics. In particular, the third movement prefigures the second movement of Mahler&#x27;s First Symphony, as well as Mahler&#x27;s Second Symphony. The Finale includes references to Brahms&#x27;s First Symphony. Mahler also spoke well of Rott&#x27;s Lieder, of which all eight surviving complete songs have been performed in concert since 2002 and four sung by Dominik Wörner were recorded in 2009 on the Ars label. We also know of a &quot;Sextet&quot;, which Mahler never heard and has also been lost. In his last years, Rott wrote a lot of music, only to destroy what he wrote soon after writing it, saying it was worthless.

Bruckner and Mahler were the first to recognise Rott&#x27;s talent. Mahler himself included references to Rott&#x27;s work in his own music. Rott&#x27;s music was largely forgotten after his death. His Symphony No. 1 in E major was not premiered until 1989; it was played by the Cincinnati Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by , in a performing edition prepared by Paul Banks. A CD recording followed.

Other recordings of the symphony have since been issued, and other Rott works have been occasionally revived, including his &quot;Julius Caesar Overture&quot;, &quot;Pastoral Overture&quot; and &quot;Prelude for Orchestra&quot;.

He figures in the murder mystery &quot;Requiem in Vienna&quot; by J. Sydney Jones.

<text>The A8 is a major road in Scotland, connecting Edinburgh to Greenock via Glasgow. Its importance diminished following the construction of the M8 motorway which also covers the route between Edinburgh and Glasgow.

==Route and relationship to M8==
===Edinburgh===
The A8 begins at the West End of Edinburgh, in the New Town. The road originally also included Princes Street, but this stretch was declassified, as Princes Street is no longer open to all traffic.

The road continues westwards into the suburbs of the city passing Murrayfield and Corstorphine, often with an accompanying bus lane. Only once the road reaches the A720 City Bypass does it become a primary route, leading out past the Royal Highland Showground at Ingliston, and Edinburgh Airport.

At Newbridge, the A8 meets the start of the M8 and M9 motorways. From here the A8 is interrupted; it has been renumbered A89 until Bathgate, A7066 to Whitburn and then B7066 Harthill, until it resumes at Newhouse.

===Glasgow===
From Newhouse it runs parallel to the M8. Until recently there was no road of motorway standard between Newhouse and Baillieston in the eastern suburbs of Glasgow, and the A8 still carried all through traffic here, having been progressively upgraded to meet demand. However it was finally replaced in 2017 by the last section of the M8. It is now the principal non-motorway access between the Eurocentral business park and the settlements of Chapelhall and Calderbank, south of Airdrie.

Just prior to Junction 8 of the M8 it diverges from the motorway, and meets the A89 at Bargeddie while co-existing as the interchange for the M8 and M73. At a roundabout near Swinton it briefly merges with the A89 and heads towards central Glasgow. The A8 now passes through suburban Garrowhill, Barlanark, Wellhouse, Springboig, Cranhill and Carntyne as Edinburgh Road – much of which is a two/three-lane dual-carriageway, but an urban restriction is still applied – then past Haghill and Dennistoun as Alexandra Parade into the city centre at Glasgow Royal Infirmary and Glasgow Cathedral, where it follows the High Street and then the Saltmarket running north–south – meeting the A89 (Gallowgate) and the A749 (London Road) at Glasgow Cross. It splits for the complex one-way system, recombining prior to the junction at the start of the A814 that heads west along the Clyde, before crossing the river near The Gorbals, where it meets the end of the A74.

From there the A8 leads out of town through Tradeston, Kingston (passing under the M8&#x27;s Kingston Bridge) Kinning Park, Cessnock and Ibrox as Paisley Road West, changing to Edmiston Drive past Ibrox Stadium, then through Drumoyne and Shieldhall as Shieldhall Road, Braehead as Renfrew Road and the town centre of Renfrew as Glasgow Road, Glebe Street and Inchinnan Road, passing to the rear of Glasgow Airport at Inchinnan, crossing over the M8 east of Bishopton and meeting it again at the motorway&#x27;s western end, Junction 31 between Bishopton and Langbank.

The A8 becomes the primary route again and takes traffic through Port Glasgow. Its terminus is in Greenock at a large roundabout with the A78 road and the A770 to Gourock, which was the former terminus of the A8.

==Euroroute designations==
Three short stretches of the A8 are part of three different Euroroutes, as follows:

* The stretch from the western end of the M8 into Greenock is part of the E05.
* Between M8 Junctions 6 and 7 is part of the E16.
* A very short stretch linking the A720 and A902 is part of the E15.

<text>The A9 is a major road in Scotland running from the Falkirk council area in central Scotland to Scrabster Harbour, Thurso in the far north, via Stirling, Bridge of Allan, Perth and Inverness. At , it is the longest road in Scotland and the fifth-longest A-road in the United Kingdom. Historically it was the main road between Edinburgh and John o&#x27; Groats, and has been called &quot;the spine of Scotland&quot;. It is one of the three major north–south trunk routes linking the Central Belt to the Highlands – the others being the A82 and the A90.

The road&#x27;s origins lie in the military roads building programme of the 18th century, further supplemented by the building of several bridges in later years. The A9 route was formally designated in 1923, and originally ran from Edinburgh to Inverness. The route was soon extended north from Inverness up to John O&#x27;Groats. By the 1970s the route was hampered by severe traffic congestion, and an extensive upgrading programme was undertaken on the section between Bridge of Allan and Inverness. This involved the bypassing of numerous towns and villages on the route, and the building of several new bridges, notably the Kessock Bridge which shortened the route north out of Inverness by .

In the south the road&#x27;s importance has been eclipsed by:
# the A90 across the Forth Road Bridge and the M90 motorway, which now link Edinburgh more directly with Perth, bypassing Stirling and Bridge of Allan as formerly important bridge points, and
# the M9, which is now the main road between Edinburgh and Stirling/Bridge of Allan.

Between Edinburgh and Falkirk the old A9 route has been reclassified into the A803 and the B9080 amongst others; part of the route between Kirkliston and Maybury no longer exists as the area is now part of Edinburgh Airport. Between Falkirk and Bridge of Allan, the A9 survives as a more or less parallel road to the M9.

The link between the M9 and the A9, by Bridge of Allan, is the Keir Roundabout.

A major project is underway to upgrade the A9 between Perth and Inverness.

==History==
 The A9&#x27;s origins lie in the military roads building programme carried out by General Wade in the 18th century to allow deployment of forces in key locations within the Highlands. At this time there was already an existing road between Perth and Dunkeld, and between 1727 and 1730 a roadway was constructed between Dunkeld in Perthshire and Inverness.

However, Wade had still to bridge the River Tay at Aberfeldy. Construction began in 1733 to a design by William Adam. The bridge, named Wade&#x27;s Bridge, was completed within the year, but Wade wrote &quot;The Bridge of Tay... was a work of great difficulty and also much more expensive than was calculated.&quot; At a cost of over £4,000, the bridge became the most expensive item on Wade&#x27;s road building programme. For most of its length between Perth and Inverness, the route was identical to the A9 prior to the commencement of the major upgrading works in the 1970s.

 In 1802, Thomas Telford was requested by the Lords of the Treasury to carry out a survey of the interior of the Scottish Highlands. In his report, he highlighted the inadequacy of the old military roads to meet the requirements of the general population. In particular, he noted the difficulties caused by the absence of bridges over some of the principal rivers. As part of the improvements to the road system that were carried out in the following years, a bridge was built at Dunkeld, designed by Telford. The original cost estimate was £15,000 with costs to be split between the government and the landowner, the 4th Duke of Atholl. However, costs spiralled up to around £40,000. The government refused to increase their financial contribution, so the Duke of Atholl had to finance the extra cost. As a result, tolls were placed on the completed bridge to recoup costs. The realigned road north out of Dunkeld would evolve eventually into the A9, and the bridge carried the bulk of the traffic into the Highlands until the new A9 by-pass was opened in 1977.
The formal scheme of classification of roads in Great Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales) was first published on 1 April 1923. The original route of the designated A9 began in Edinburgh at the Corstorphine junction in the west of the city, branching north off the A8. The route went through Kirkliston and onwards to Polmont and Falkirk. The road then followed the now familiar route to Stirling and then up to Perth and onwards to Inverness, going through numerous villages en route. The original A9 terminated at Inverness, but in the years that followed it was extended to include the roadway all the way up to John O&#x27;Groats. By the 1970s, the A9 went north-west out of Inverness in what had originally been classified as the A88, following the Beauly Firth coast westwards through Kirkhill, Beauly and Muir of Ord. Continuing north through Dingwall, the road then began to follow the Cromarty Firth coast, where it followed largely the modern alignment, going through Alness and Tain (both now bypassed). The A9 from here followed west along the south side of the Dornoch Firth coast before reaching Bonar Bridge where the road turned sharply eastwards on the north side of the Dornoch Firth. On reaching the village of Dornoch, the A9 headed north along the coast, going through several villages before reaching the town of Wick. The final stretch continued north along the coast before it finally reached John O&#x27;Groats.

==Improvements==
===A9 dualling Perth to Inverness===

Between Perth and Inverness, a project is underway to upgrade the A9 from a single carriageway to a dual carriageway. This was due to the response in which overtaking can be dangerous and because a head-on collision can occur due to the lack of crash barriers. This started in 2015 and was due to be finished in 2025, but delays to the project meant that meeting the original deadline was going to be impossible. This project was announced in 2011. Only two out of the eleven sections have been completed as of December 2023. In October 2024, preparatory works began on the six mile section between Tomatin and Moy, with an expected cost of £308 million. Full construction work is to begin in spring 2025 and due to finish in three years time. A similar scheme is in place for the A96 between Aberdeen and Inverness. Tay Crossing to Ballinluig sections (close to Perth) is under tender and should start construction in 2025.

The section between Bridge of Allan and Inverness, via Perth, was substantially rebuilt during the 1970s and 80s, including the creation of the Jubilee Bridge in 1977. The improved A9 route follows essentially the same route as the initial road except where it bypasses towns and villages instead of running through their centres. Between Perth and Inverness, the road has been dubbed &quot;Killer A9&quot;, because of accidents and fatalities where dual-carriageway sections merge into a single-carriageway – the principal cause being motorists driving at excessive speeds to overtake lines of slower-moving vehicles before the dual carriageway ends.

Average speed cameras were installed and became operational in 2014. At the same time, the HGV speed limit also increased from 40 to 50 mph.

===Hairpin turn===
In 2014, Transport Scotland has announced a plan to improve Berriedale Braes&#x27; hairpin turn. A fatal collision has occurred on that turn in September 2014 due to brake failure from a lorry. One month earlier, a lorry caught fire, causing a 77-mile (123-km) diversion, though no one was hurt. The improved hairpin turn opened to traffic on 21 August 2020.

==Route==

The original starting section of the A9 between Edinburgh and Polmont no longer exists as such, having been reclassified over the years in a variety of ways; part of the original route between Kirkliston and Maybury no longer exists at all as the area is now part of Edinburgh Airport. The modern A9 begins at the M9 junction 5 (Cadgers Brae) on the outskirts of Polmont, just east of Falkirk, and continues through Falkirk itself and on though Larbert, Stirling and Bridge of Allan. It then becomes a primary route dual carriageway at the Keir Roundabout, just south of Dunblane, and continues north as a dual carriageway to Perth bypassing Dunblane, Blackford and Auchterarder.

At Broxden Junction on the outskirts of Perth, the A9 meets the M90 motorway which carries traffic from Fife and the Forth Road Bridge. Broxden Junction is one of the busiest and most important road junctions in Scotland, with links to all eight Scottish cities.

The section between Perth and Inverness is often cited as being the most dangerous section of the road, and regularly appears in lists of Scotland&#x27;s most dangerous roads. This portion of the road is mostly single-carriageway, however there are intermittent short sections of dual carriageway from Perth to Birnam, Pitlochry to Killiecrankie, south of Drumochter Summit, Slochd Summit to Tomatin and south of Inverness as well as shorter three lane overtaking sections to reduce frustration and accidents. All the towns on this section of the route have now been bypassed.

The section from Keir Roundabout to Inverness had average speed cameras installed in 2014 and at the same time the single carriageway speed limit for HGVs was increased from to .

In the north, beyond Inverness, the A9 designation has been transferred in response to construction of new bridges across the Moray Firth (the Kessock Bridge), the Cromarty Firth and the Dornoch Firth; and so that the A9 leads not to John o&#x27; Groats but to Scrabster Harbour, Thurso, where a government-supported ferry service takes traffic to and from Stromness in Orkney. Therefore, various towns and villages which were on the A9 are now seriously distanced from this trunk road.

Between Perth and Inverness, the A9 forms part of Euroroute E15. Inverness is the northern terminus of this route.

From Falkirk to Bridge of Allan the A9 runs through or near Bannockburn, Plean, Torwood, Larbert and Stirling.

From Bridge of Allan to Inverness the A9 runs through or near Lecropt, Dunblane, Blackford, Auchterarder, Gleneagles, Broxden Junction, Perth, Birnam, Dunkeld, Pitlochry, Blair Atholl, the Grampian Mountains, Dalwhinnie, Newtonmore, Kingussie, Aviemore, Carrbridge, Tomatin and Moy.

From Inverness the A9 runs across, through or near the Moray Firth, the Black Isle, Tore, Muir of Ord, Conon Bridge, the Cromarty Firth, Easter Ross, Dingwall, Evanton, Alness, Invergordon, Nigg Bay, Fearn, Tain, the Dornoch Firth, Sutherland, Dornoch, The Mound, Golspie, Dunrobin Castle, Brora, Helmsdale, Caithness, Berriedale (and the Berriedale Braes), Badbea, Dunbeath, Latheron, Mybster,
Georgemas and Thurso. The road ends at Scrabster Harbour, Thurso.

<text>Therese of Lisieux (born Marie Françoise-Thérèse Martin; 2 January 1873 – 30 September 1897), in religion Therese of the Child Jesus and the Holy Face, was a French Discalced Carmelite who is widely venerated in modern times. She is popularly known in English as the Little Flower of Jesus, or simply the Little Flower, and in French as (&quot;Little Therese&quot;).

Therese has been a highly influential model of sanctity for Catholics and for others because of the simplicity and practicality of her approach to the spiritual life. She is one of the most popular saints in the history of the church, although she was obscure during her lifetime. Pope Pius X called her &quot;the greatest saint of modern times&quot;.

Therese felt an early call to religious life and, after overcoming various obstacles, in 1888, at age 15, she became a nun and joined two of her elder sisters in the cloistered Carmelite community of Lisieux, Normandy (another sister, Céline, also later joined the order). After nine years as a Carmelite nun, having fulfilled various offices such as sacristan and assistant to the novice mistress, in her last eighteen months in Carmel she fell into a night of faith, in which she is said to have felt Jesus was absent and been tormented by doubts that God existed. Therese died at the age of 24 from tuberculosis.

After her death, Therese became known globally through her spiritual memoir, &quot;The Story of a Soul&quot;, which explains her theology of the &quot;Little Way&quot;. As a result of her immense popularity and reputation for holiness, she was quickly beatified and canonized by Pope Pius XI, who completed the process just 28 years after her death. In 1997, Pope John Paul II declared her a Doctor of the Church. Her feast day in the General Roman Calendar was 3 October from 1927 until it was moved in 1969 to 1 October. She is well known throughout the world, with the Basilica of Lisieux being the second most popular place of pilgrimage in France after Lourdes.

==Life==
===Family background===

Therese was born on Rue Saint-Blaise, in Alençon, France on 2 January 1873, and was the daughter of Marie-Azélie Guérin (usually called Zélie), and Louis Martin who was a jeweler and watchmaker. Both her parents were devout Catholics who would eventually become the first (and to date only) married couple canonized together by the Roman Catholic Church (by Pope Francis in 2015).

Louis had tried to become a canon regular, wanting to enter the Great St Bernard Hospice, but had been refused because he did not know Latin. Zélie, possessed of a strong, active temperament, wished to serve the sick, and had also considered entering consecrated life, but the prioress of the canonesses regular of the Hôtel-Dieu in Alençon had discouraged her outright. Disappointed, Zélie learned lacemaking instead. She excelled in it and set up her own business on Rue Saint-Blaise at age 22.

Louis and Zélie met in early 1858 and married on July 13 of that same year at the Basilica of Notre-Dame d&#x27;Alençon. At first they decided to live as brother and sister in a perpetual continence, but when a confessor discouraged them in this, they changed their lifestyle and had nine children. From 1867 to 1870, they lost 3 infants and five-year-old Hélène. All five of their surviving daughters became nuns. In addition to Therese, they were:

* (February 22, 1860, a Carmelite in Lisieux, in religion Sister Marie of the Sacred Heart, d. January 19, 1940),
* Marie-Pauline (September 7, 1861, a Carmelite in Lisieux, in religion Mother Agnes of Jesus, d. July 28, 1951),
* Léonie (June 3, 1863, a Visitandine at Caen, in religion Sister Françoise-Thérèse, d. June 16, 1941), and
* (April 28, 1869, a Carmelite in Lisieux, in religion Sister Geneviève of the Holy Face, d. February 25, 1959).

&quot;A dreamer and brooder, an idealist and romantic, [the father] gave touching and naïve pet names [to his daughters]: Marie was his &#x27;diamond&#x27;, Pauline his &#x27;noble pearl&#x27;, Céline &#x27;the bold one&#x27;. But Therese was his &#x27;little queen&#x27;, to whom all treasures belonged.&quot;

===Birth and infancy===
Soon after her birth in January 1873, the outlook for the survival of Therese Martin was uncertain. Because of her frail condition, she was entrusted to a wet nurse, Rose Taillé, who had already nursed two of the Martin children. Rose had her own children and could not live with the Martins, so Therese was sent to live with her in the forests of Semallé.

On 2 April 1874, when she was 15 months old, she returned to Alençon where her family surrounded her with affection. &quot;I hear the baby calling me &quot;Mama!&quot; as she goes down the stairs. On every step, she calls out &quot;Mama!&quot; and if I don&#x27;t respond every time, she remains there without going either forward or back.&quot; (Madame Martin to Pauline, 21 November 1875) She was educated in a very Catholic environment, including Mass attendance at 5:30a.m., the strict observance of fasts, and prayer to the rhythm of the liturgical year. The Martins also practiced charity, visiting the sick and elderly and welcoming the occasional vagabond to their table. Even if she was not the model little girl her sisters later portrayed, Therese was very responsive to this education. She played at being a nun. Described as generally a happy child, she also manifested other emotions, and often cried: &quot;Céline is playing with the little one with some bricks […] I have to correct poor baby who gets into frightful tantrums when she can&#x27;t have her own way. She rolls in the floor in despair believing all is lost. Sometimes she is so overcome she almost chokes. She&#x27;s a nervous child, but she is very good, very intelligent, and remembers everything.&quot; At 22, Therese, then a Carmelite, admitted: &quot;I was far from being a perfect little girl&quot;.

From 1865 Zélie had complained of breast pain and in December 1876 a doctor told her of the seriousness of the tumour. In June 1877 she left for Lourdes hoping to be cured, but the miracle did not happen. On 28 August 1877, Zélie died, aged 45. Her funeral was conducted in the Basilica of Notre-Dame d&#x27;Alençon. Therese was barely four and a half years old. She wrote: &quot;Every detail of my mother&#x27;s illness is still with me, specially her last weeks on earth.&quot; She remembered the bedroom scene where her dying mother received the last sacraments while Therese knelt and her father cried. She wrote: &quot;When Mummy died, my happy disposition changed. I had been so lively and open; now I became diffident and oversensitive, crying if anyone looked at me. I was only happy if no one took notice of me… It was only in the intimacy of my own family, where everyone was wonderfully kind, that I could be more myself.&quot;
Three months after Zélie died, Louis Martin left Alençon, where he had spent his youth and marriage, and moved to Lisieux in the Calvados Department of Normandy, where Zélie&#x27;s pharmacist brother, Isidore Guérin, lived with his wife and their two daughters, Jeanne and Marie. In her last months Zélie had given up the lace business. After her death, Louis sold it. Louis leased a pretty, spacious country house, , situated in a large garden on the slope of a hill overlooking the town. Looking back, Therese would see the move to as the beginning of the &quot;second period of my life, the most painful of the three: it extends from the age of four-and-a-half to fourteen, the time when I rediscovered my childhood character, and entered into the serious side of life&quot;. In Lisieux, Pauline took on the role of Therese&#x27;s &quot;Mama&quot;. She took this role seriously, and Therese grew especially close to her, and to Céline, the sister closest to her in age.

===Early years===

Therese was taught at home until she was eight and a half, and then entered the school kept by the Benedictine nuns of the Abbey of Notre Dame du Pre in Lisieux. Therese, taught well and carefully by Marie and Pauline, found herself at the top of the class, except for writing and arithmetic. However, because of her young age and high grades, she was bullied. The one who bullied her the most was a girl of fourteen who did poorly at school. Therese suffered very much as a result of her sensitivity, and she cried in silence. Furthermore, the boisterous games at recreation were not to her taste. She preferred to tell stories or look after the little ones in the infants class. &quot;The five years I spent at school were the saddest of my life, and if my dear Céline had not been with me I could not have stayed there for a single month without falling ill.&quot; Céline informs us, &quot;She now developed a fondness for hiding, she did not want to be observed, for she sincerely considered herself inferior&quot;.
On her free days she became more and more attached to Marie Guérin, the younger of her two cousins in Lisieux. The two girls would play at being anchorites, as the great Teresa had once played with her brother. And every evening she plunged into the family circle. Yet the tension of the double life and the daily self-conquest placed a strain on Therese. Going to school became more and more difficult.

When she was nine years old, in October 1882, her sister Pauline entered the Carmelite convent at Lisieux. Therese was devastated. She understood that Pauline was cloistered and that she would never come back. &quot;I said in the depths of my heart: Pauline is lost to me!&quot; She also wanted to join the Carmelites, but was told she was too young. Yet, Therese so impressed Mother Marie Gonzague, the prioress that she wrote to comfort Therese around the turn of the year 1882/83, calling her &quot;my little daughter Therese of the Child Jesus&quot;.

===Illness===
At this time, Therese was often sick. She began to suffer from nervous tremors. The tremors started one night after her uncle took her for a walk and began to talk about Zélie. Assuming that she was cold, the family covered Therese with blankets, but the tremors continued. She clenched her teeth and could not speak. The family called Dr. Notta, who could make no diagnosis. In 1882, Dr. Gayral diagnosed that Therese &quot;reacts to an emotional frustration with a neurotic attack&quot;.

Alarmed, but cloistered, Pauline began to write letters to Therese and attempted various strategies to intervene. Eventually Therese recovered after she had turned to gaze at the statue of the Virgin Mary placed in Marie&#x27;s room, where Therese had been moved. She reported on 13 May 1883 that she had seen the Virgin smile at her. She wrote: &quot;Our Blessed Lady has come to me, she has smiled upon me. How happy I am.&quot; However, when Therese told the Carmelite nuns about this vision at the request of her eldest sister Marie, she found herself assailed by their questions and she lost confidence. Self-doubt made her begin to question what had happened. &quot;I thought I &quot;had lied&quot; – I was unable to look upon myself without a feeling of &quot;profound horror&quot;.&quot; &quot;For a long time after my cure, I thought that my sickness was deliberate and this was a real martyrdom for my soul&quot;. Her concerns over this continued until November 1887.

In October 1886, her oldest sister, Marie, entered the same Carmelite monastery, adding to Therese&#x27;s grief. Therese was angry and shed &quot;bitter tears&quot; as Marie did not wait for her.

Therese also suffered from scruples, a condition experienced by other saints such as Alphonsus Liguori, also a Doctor of the Church, and Ignatius Loyola, the founder of the Jesuits. She wrote: &quot;One would have to pass through this martyrdom to understand it well, and for me to express what I experienced for a year and a half would be impossible&quot;.

===Complete conversion===

Christmas Eve of 1886 was a turning point in the life of Therese; she called it her &quot;complete conversion&quot;. Years later she stated that on that night she overcame the pressures she had faced since the death of her mother and said that &quot;God worked a little miracle to make me grow up in an instant[...] On that blessed night[...] Jesus, who saw fit to make Himself a child out of love for me, saw fit to have me come forth from the swaddling clothes and imperfections of childhood&quot;.

That night, Louis Martin and his daughters, Léonie, Céline and Therese, attended Midnight Mass at the cathedral in Lisieux – &quot;but there was very little heart left in them. On 1 December, Léonie, covered in eczema and hiding her hair under a short mantilla, had returned to after just seven weeks of the Poor Clares regime in Alençon&quot;, and her sisters were helping her get over her sense of failure and humiliation. Back at as every year, Therese &quot;as was the custom for French children, had left her shoes on the hearth, empty in anticipation of gifts, not from Father Christmas but from the Child Jesus, who was imagined to travel through the air bearing toys and cakes.&quot; When looking at Therese&#x27;s shoes on the fireplace she heard her father saying, &quot;Well, fortunately, this will be the last year!&quot; Therese had begun to cry and Céline advised her not to go back downstairs immediately. Then, suddenly, Therese pulled herself together and wiped her tears. She ran down the stairs, knelt by the fireplace and unwrapped her surprises as jubilantly as ever. In her account, nine years later, of 1895: &quot;The work I had been unable to do in ten years was done by Jesus in one instant, contenting himself with my good will which was never lacking.&quot; She discovered the joy in self-forgetfulness and added, &quot;I felt charity enter into my soul, and the need to forget myself and to please others; since then I&#x27;ve been happy!&quot; &quot;Since that night I have never been defeated in any combat, but rather walked from victory to victory, beginning, so to speak, &#x27;to run as a giant&#x27;!&quot;

According to Ida Görres, &quot;Therese instantly understood what had happened to her when she won this banal little over her sensitivity, which she had borne for so long;[...] freedom is found in resolutely looking away from oneself[...] and the fact that a person can cast himself away from himself reveals again that being good, is pure grace, a sudden gift[...] It cannot be coerced, and yet it can be received only by the patiently prepared heart&quot;. Biographer Kathryn Harrison: &quot;After all, in the past she tried to control herself, had tried with all her being and had failed. Grace, alchemy, masochism: through whatever lens we view her transport, Therese&#x27;s night of illumination presented both its power and its danger. It would guide her steps between the mortal and the divine, between living and dying, destruction and apotheosis. It would take her exactly where she intended to go&quot;.

Therese&#x27;s character and the early experiences that shaped her have been the subject of analysis, particularly in recent years. The Catholic author Ida Görres, whose formal studies had focused on church history and hagiography, wrote a psychological analysis of Therese&#x27;s character. Some authors suggest that Therese had a strongly neurotic aspect to her personality for most of her life. Harrison concluded that, &quot;her temperament was not formed for compromise or moderation[...] a life spent not taming but directing her appetite and her will, a life perhaps shortened by the force of her desire and ambition.&quot;

===Rome and entry to Carmel===

Before she was fourteen, when she started to experience a period of calm, Therese started to read &quot;The Imitation of Christ&quot;. She read the &quot;Imitation&quot; intently, as if the author traced each sentence for her: &quot;The Kingdom of God is within you… Turn thee with thy whole heart unto the Lord; and forsake this wretched world: and thy soul shall find rest.&quot; She kept the book with her constantly and wrote later that this book and parts of another book of a very different character, lectures by Abbé Charles Arminjon on &quot;The End of This World, and the Mysteries of the World to Come&quot;, nourished her during this critical period. Thereafter she began to read other books, mostly on history and science.

In May 1887, Therese approached her 63-year-old father Louis, who was recovering from a small stroke, while he sat in the garden one Sunday afternoon and told him that she wanted to celebrate the anniversary of &quot;her conversion&quot; by entering Carmel before Christmas. Louis and Therese both broke down and cried, but Louis got up, gently picked a white flower and gave it to her, explaining the care with which God brought it into being and preserved it until that day. Therese later wrote: &quot;While I listened I believed I was hearing my own story, so great was the resemblance between what Jesus had done for the little flower and little Thérèse&quot;. To Therese, the flower seemed a symbol of herself, &quot;seemed destined to live on in another soil more fertile than the tender moss where it had spent its first days.&quot; Therese renewed her attempts to join the Carmel, but the Father Superior of Carmel would not allow it on account of her youth.
During the summer, French newspapers were filled with the story of , convicted of the brutal murder of two women and a child. To the outraged public Pranzini represented all that threatened the decent way of life in France. In July and August 1887 Thérèse prayed hard for the conversion of Pranzini, so his soul could be saved, yet Pranzini showed no remorse. At the end of August, the newspapers reported that just as Pranzini&#x27;s neck was placed on the guillotine, he had grabbed a crucifix and kissed it three times. Thérèse was ecstatic and believed that her prayers had saved him. She continued to pray for Pranzini after his death.

In November 1887, Louis took Céline and Therese on a diocesan pilgrimage to Rome for the priestly jubilee of Pope Leo XIII. On 20 November 1887, during a general audience with Leo XIII, Therese, in her turn, approached the Pope, knelt, and asked him to allow her to enter Carmel. The Pope said: &quot;Well, my child, do what the superiors decide… You will enter if it is God&#x27;s Will&quot; and he blessed her. She refused to leave his feet, and the Noble Guard had to carry her out of the room.

The trip continued: they visited Pompeii, Naples, Assisi before going back via Pisa and Genoa. The pilgrimage of nearly a month was timely. During it she &quot;learnt more than in many years of study&quot;. For the first and last time in her life, she left her native Normandy. Notably she &quot;who only knew priests in the exercise of their ministry was in their company, heard their conversations, not always edifyingand saw their shortcomings for herself&quot;.

She had understood that she had to pray and give her life for sinners like Pranzini. But Carmel prayed especially for priests and this had surprised her since their souls seemed to her to be &quot;as pure as crystal&quot;. A month spent with many priests taught her that they are &quot;weak and feeble men&quot;. She wrote later: &quot;I met many saintly priests that month, but I also found that in spite of being above angels by their supreme dignity, they were none the less men and still subject to human weakness. If the holy priests, &#x27;the salt of the earth&#x27;, as Jesus calls them in the Gospel, have to be prayed for, what about the lukewarm? Again, as Jesus says, &#x27;If the salt shall lose its savour, wherewith shall it be salted?&#x27; I understood my vocation in Italy.&quot; For the first time too she had associated with young men. &quot;In her brotherless existence, masculinity had been represented only by her father, her Uncle Guérin and various priests. Now she had her first and only experiences. Céline declared at the beatification proceedings that one of the young men in the pilgrimage group &quot;developed a tender affection for her&quot;. Therese confessed to her sister, &quot;It is high time for Jesus to remove me from the poisonous breath of the world […] I feel that my heart is easily caught by tenderness, and where others fall, I would fall too. We are no stronger than the others&quot;. Soon after that, the Bishop of Bayeux authorized the prioress to receive Therese. On 9 April 1888 she became a postulant in the Carmel of Lisieux.

=== The Carmel of Lisieux ===
The convent Therese entered was an old-established house with a long tradition. In 1838 two nuns from the Carmel at Poitiers had been sent out to found the convent of Lisieux. One of them, Mother Geneviève of St Teresa, was still living. When Therese entered the second wing, containing the cells and sickrooms in which she was to live and die, which had been standing only ten years, &quot;What she found was a community of very aged nuns, some odd and cranky, some sick and troubled, some lukewarm and complacent. Almost all of the sisters came from the petty bourgeois and artisan class. The Prioress and Novice Mistress were of old Normandy nobility. Probably the Martin sisters alone represented the new class of the rising bourgeoisie&quot;.

The Carmelite order had been reformed in the sixteenth century by Teresa of Ávila, essentially devoted to personal and collective prayer. The nuns of Lisieux followed strict constitutions that allowed for only one meal a day for seven months of the year, and little free time. Only one room of the building was heated. The times of silence and of solitude were many but the foundress had also planned for time for work and relaxation in commonthe austerity of the life should not hinder sisterly and joyful relations. Founded in 1838, the Carmel of Lisieux in 1888 had 26 nuns, from very different classes and backgrounds. For the majority of the life of Therese, the prioress would be Mother Marie de Gonzague, born Marie-Adéle-Rosalie Davy de Virville. When Therese entered the convent Marie de Gonzague was 54, a woman of changeable humour, jealous of her authority, used sometimes in a capricious manner; this had for effect, a certain laxity in the observance of established rules. &quot;In the sixties and seventies of the [nineteenth] century an aristocrat in the flesh counted for far more in a petty bourgeois convent than we can realize nowadays ... the superiors appointed Marie de Gonzague to the highest offices as soon as her novitiate was finished ... in 1874 began the long series of terms as prioress&quot;.

===Postulancy===
Therese&#x27;s time as a postulant began with her welcome into the Carmel, Monday, 9 April 1888. She felt peace after she received communion that day and later wrote: &quot;At last my desires were realized, and I cannot describe the deep sweet peace which filled my soul. This peace has remained with me during the eight and a half years of my life here, and has never left me even amid the greatest trials.&quot;

From her childhood, Therese had dreamed of the desert to which God would some day lead her. Now she had entered that desert. Though she was now reunited with Marie and Pauline, from the first day she began her struggle to win and keep her distance from her sisters. Right at the start Marie de Gonzague, the prioress, had turned the postulant Therese over to her eldest sister Marie, who was to teach her to follow the Liturgy of the Hours. Later she appointed Therese assistant to Pauline in the refectory. When her cousin Marie Guerin also entered, she employed her and Therese to be sacristans.

Therese adhered strictly to the rule which forbade all superfluous talk during work. She saw her sisters together only in the hours of common recreation after meals. At such times she would sit down beside whomever she happened to be near, or beside a nun whom she had observed to be downcast, disregarding the tacit and sometimes expressed sensitivity and even jealousy of her biological sisters. &quot;We must apologize to the others for our being four under one roof&quot;, she was in the habit of remarking. &quot;When I am dead, you must be very careful not to lead a family life with one another ... I did not come to Carmel to be with my sisters; on the contrary, I saw clearly that their presence would cost me dear, for I was determined not to give way to nature.&quot;

Although the novice mistress, Marie of the Angels, found Therese slow, the young postulant adapted well to her new environment. She wrote, &quot;Illusions, God gave me the grace not to have a single one when entering Carmel. I found the religious life to be exactly as I had imagined it, no sacrifice astonished me and yet ... my first steps met with more thorns than roses!&quot;

She chose a spiritual director, Almire Pichon SJ. At their first meeting, 28 May 1888, she made a general confession going back over all her past sins. She came away from it profoundly relieved. The priest who had himself suffered from scruples, understood her and reassured her. A few months later, he left for Canada, and Therese would only be able to ask his advice by letter and his replies were rare. (On 4 July 1897, she confided to Pauline, &quot;Father Pichon treated me too much like a child; however, he also did me good by telling me that I had not committed a mortal sin.&quot; During her time as a postulant, Therese had to endure some bullying from other sisters because of her lack of aptitude for handicrafts and manual work. Sister St Vincent de Paul, the finest embroiderer in the community, made her feel awkward and even called her &quot;the big nanny goat&quot;. Therese was in fact the tallest in the family at .

Like all nuns Therese discovered the ups and downs related to differences in temperament, character, problems of sensitivities or infirmities. But the greatest suffering came from outside Carmel. On 23 June 1888, Louis Martin disappeared from his home and was found days later, in the post office in Le Havre. The incident marked the onset of her father&#x27;s decline. He died on July 29, 1894.

===Novitiate===
The end of Therese&#x27;s time as a postulant arrived on the January 10, 1889, with her taking of the habit. From that time she wore the &quot;rough homespun and brown scapular, white wimple and veil, leather belt with rosary, woollen &#x27;stockings&#x27;, rope sandals&quot;. Her father&#x27;s health having temporarily stabilized he was able to attend, though twelve days after her ceremony her father suffered a stroke and was taken to a private sanatorium, the Bon Sauveur at Caen, where he remained for three years before returning to Lisieux in 1892. In this period Therese deepened the sense of her vocation; to lead a hidden life, to pray and offer her suffering for priests, to forget herself, to increase discreet acts of charity. She wrote, &quot;I applied myself especially to practice little virtues, not having the facility to perform great ones […] In her letters from this period of her novitiate, Therese returned over and over to the theme of littleness, referring to herself as a grain of sand, an image she borrowed from Pauline… &#x27;Always littler, lighter, in order to be lifted more easily by the breeze of love&#x27;. The remainder of her life would be defined by retreat and subtraction&quot;.

She absorbed the work of John of the Cross, spiritual reading uncommon at the time, especially for such a young nun. &quot;Oh! what insights I have gained from the works of our holy father, St. John of the Cross! When I was seventeen and eighteen, I had no other spiritual nourishment…&quot; She felt a kinship with this classic writer of the Carmelite Order (though nothing seems to have drawn her to the writing of Teresa of Ávila), and with enthusiasm she read his works, &quot;The Ascent of Mount Carmel&quot;, the &quot;Way of Purification&quot;, the &quot;Spiritual Canticle&quot;, the &quot;Living Flame of Love&quot;. Passages from these writings are woven into everything she herself said and wrote. The fear of God, which she found in certain sisters, paralyzed her. &quot;My nature is such that fear makes me recoil, with LOVE not only do I go forward, I fly&quot;.

With the new name a Carmelite receives when she enters the order, there is always an epithet – for example, Teresa of Jesus, Elizabeth of the Trinity, Anne of the Angels. The epithet singles out the Mystery which she is supposed to contemplate with special devotion. &quot;Therese&#x27;s names in religion – she had two – must be taken together to define their religious significance&quot;. The first name was promised to her at nine, by Mother Marie de Gonzague, &quot;of the Child Jesus&quot;, and was given to her on her entry to the convent. In itself, veneration of the childhood of Jesus was a Carmelite heritage of the seventeenth century – it concentrated upon the staggering humiliation of divine majesty in assuming the shape of extreme weakness and helplessness. The French Oratory of Jesus and Pierre de Bérulle renewed this old devotional practice. Yet when she received the veil, Therese took the second name &quot;of the Holy Face&quot;.

During the course of her novitiate, contemplation of the Holy Face was said to have nourished her inner life. This is an image representing the disfigured face of Jesus during the Passion. She meditated on certain passages from the prophet Isaiah (Chapter 53). Six weeks before her death she remarked to Pauline, &quot;The words in Isaiah: &#x27;no stateliness here, no majesty, no beauty, […] one despised, left out of all human reckoning; How should we take any account of him, a man so despised ( 53:2–3) – these words were the basis of my whole worship of the Holy Face. I, too, wanted to be without comeliness and beauty, unknown to all creatures.&quot; On the eve of her profession she wrote to Sister Marie, &quot;Tomorrow I shall be the bride of Jesus &#x27;whose face was hidden and whom no man knew&#x27; – what a union and what a future!&quot;. The meditation also helped her understand the humiliating situation of her father.

Usually the novitiate preceding profession lasted a year. Sister Therese hoped to make her final commitment on or after 11 January 1890 but, considered still too young for a final commitment, her profession was postponed. She would spend eight months longer than the standard year as an unprofessed novice. As 1889 ended, her old home in the world, , was dismantled, the furniture divided among the Guérins and the Carmel. It was not until 8 September 1890, aged 17-and-a-half, that she made her religious profession. The retreat in anticipation of her &quot;irrevocable promises&quot; was characterized by &quot;absolute aridity&quot; and on the eve of her profession she gave way to panic. She worried that &quot;What she wanted was beyond her. Her vocation was a sham&quot;.

Reassured by the novice mistress and mother Marie de Gonzague, the next day her religious profession went ahead, &quot;an outpouring of peace flooded my soul, &quot;that peace which surpasseth all understanding&quot; (Phil. 4:7)&quot;. Against her heart she wore her letter of profession written during her retreat. &quot;May creatures be nothing for me, and may I be nothing for them, but may You, Jesus, be everything! Let nobody be occupied with me, let me be looked upon as one to be trampled underfoot […] may Your will be done in me perfectly… Jesus, allow me to save very many souls; let no soul be lost today; let all the souls in purgatory be saved…&quot; On September 24, the public ceremony followed filled with &#x27;sadness and bitterness&#x27;. &quot;Thérèse found herself young enough, alone enough, to weep over the absence of Bishop Hugonin, Père Pichon, in Canada; and her own father, still confined in the asylum&quot;. But Mother Marie de Gonzague wrote to the prioress of Tours, &quot;The angelic child is seventeen and a half, and she has the judgment of one of thirty, the religious perfection of an old perfected novice, and possession of herself; she is a perfect nun.&quot;

===Life as a Carmelite===

The years which followed were a maturation. Therese prayed without great sensitive emotions, she increased the small acts of charity and care for others, doing small services. She accepted criticism in silence, even unjust criticisms, and smiled at the sisters who were unpleasant to her. She always prayed for priests, and in particular for Hyacinthe Loyson, a priest who had been a Sulpician and a Dominican novice, then a Carmelite for ten years, but had withdrawn from the Catholic Church in 1870. Two years later he married a Protestant widow whom he had brought to Catholicism years ago. After his excommunication, he continued to travel around France giving lectures. While clerical papers called Loyson a &quot;renegade&quot; and Léon Bloy lampooned him, Therese prayed throughout her religious life for the conversion of this former Carmelite whom she called &quot;our brother, a son of the Blessed Virgin&quot;. She offered her last communion, 19 August 1897, for Loyson.

The chaplain to the Carmel, Father Youf, insisted a lot on the fear of Hell. The preachers during spiritual retreats at that time emphasised sin, the sufferings of purgatory, and those of hell. This did not help. Therese who in 1891 experienced, &quot;great inner trials of all kinds, even wondering sometimes whether heaven existed&quot;. One phrase heard during a sermon made her weep: &quot;No one knows if they are worthy of love or of hate.&quot; However the retreat of October 1891 was preached by Father Alexis Prou, a Franciscan from Saint-Nazaire. &quot;He specialized in large crowds (he preached in factories) and did not seem the right person to help Carmelites. Just one of them found comfort in his words, Sister Thérèse of the Child Jesus […] [his] preaching on abandonment and mercy expanded her heart&quot;.

This confirmed her own intuitions. She wrote, &quot;My soul was like a book which the priest read better than I did. He launched me full sail on the waves of confidence and love which held such an attraction for me, but upon which I had not dared to venture. He told me that my faults did not offend God.&quot; Her spiritual life drew more and more on the Gospels that she carried with her at all times. The piety of her time was fed more on commentaries, but Therese had asked Céline to get the Gospels and the Epistles of St Paul bound into a single small volume which she could carry on her heart. She said, &quot;But it is especially the Gospels which sustain me during my hours of prayer, for in them I find what is necessary for my poor little soul. I am constantly discovering in them new lights, hidden and mysterious meanings.&quot;

Over time Therese realised that she felt no attraction to the exalted heights of &quot;great souls&quot;. She looked directly for the word of Jesus, which shed light on her prayers and on her daily life. Therese&#x27;s retreat in October 1892 pointed to a &quot;downward&quot; path for her. If asked where she lived, she would pause and quote, &quot;The foxes have their lairs, the birds of heaven their nests, but I have no place to rest my head.&quot; (Matthew 8:20). She wrote to Céline (letter 19 October 1892), &quot;Jesus raised us above all the fragile things of this world whose image passes away. Like Zacchaeus, we climbed a tree to see Jesus and now let us listen to what he is saying to us. Make haste to descend, I must lodge today at your house. Well, Jesus tells us to descend?&quot; &quot;A question here of the interior,&quot; she qualified in her letter, lest Céline think she meant renouncing food or shelter. &quot;Thérèse knew her virtues, even her love, to be flawed, flawed by self, a mirror too clouded to reflect the divine.&quot; She continued to seek to discover the means, &quot;more efficiently to strip herself of self&quot;. &quot;No doubt, [our hearts] are already empty of creatures, but, alas, I feel mine is not entirely empty of myself, and it is for this reason that Jesus tells me to descend.&quot;

===Election of Mother Agnes===
On 20 February 1893, Pauline was elected prioress of Carmel and became &quot;Mother Agnes&quot;. She appointed the former prioress as novice mistress and made Therese her assistant. The work of guiding the novices would fall primarily to Therese.

Over the next few years she revealed a talent for clarifying doctrine to those who had not received as much education as she. A kaleidoscope, whose three mirrors transform scraps of coloured paper into beautiful designs, provided an inspired illustration for the Holy Trinity. &quot;As long as our actions, even the smallest, do not fall away from the focus of Divine Love, the Holy Trinity, symbolized by the three mirrors, allows them to reflect wonderful beauty. Jesus, who regards us through the little lens, that is to say, through Himself, always sees beauty in everything we do. But if we left the focus of inexpressible love, what would He see? Bits of straw […] dirty, worthless actions&quot;. &quot;Another cherished image was that of the newly invented elevator, a vehicle Therese used many times over to describe God&#x27;s grace, a force that lifts us to heights we can&#x27;t reach on our own&quot;. Martha of Jesus, a novice who spent her childhood in a series of orphanages and who was described by all as emotionally unbalanced, with a violent temper, gave witness during the beatification process of the &#x27;unusual dedication and presence of her young teacher. &quot;Thérèse deliberately &#x27;sought out the company of those nuns whose temperaments she found hardest to bear.&#x27; What merit was there in acting charitably toward people whom one loved naturally? Thérèse went out of her way to spend time with, and therefore to love, the people she found repellent. It was an effective means of achieving interior poverty, a way to remove a place to rest her head&quot;.

In September 1893, Therese, having been a temporarily professed for the standard three years, asked not to be promoted but to continue a novice indefinitely. As a novice she would always have to ask permission of the other sisters with perpetual vows. She would never be elected to any position of importance. Remaining closely associated with the other novices, she could continue to care for her spiritual charges. In 1841 Jules Michelet devoted the major part of the fifth volume of his &quot;History of France&quot; to a favourable presentation of the epic of Joan of Arc. Félix Dupanloup worked relentlessly for the glorification of Joan who, on 8 May 1429 had liberated Orléans, the city of which he became bishop in 1849. Therese wrote, among others, two plays in honour of her childhood heroine, the first about Joan&#x27;s response to the heavenly voices calling her to battle, the second about her resulting martyrdom.

1894 brought a national celebration of Joan of Arc. On 27 January, Leo XIII authorized the introduction of her cause of beatification, declaring Joan, the shepherdess from Lorraine venerable. Therese used Henri-Alexandre Wallon&#x27;s history of Joan of Arc – a book her uncle Isidore had given to the Carmel – to help her write two plays, &quot;pious recreations&quot;, &quot;small theatrical pieces performed by a few nuns for the rest of the community, on the occasion of certain feast days&quot;. The first of these, &quot;The Mission of Joan of Arc&quot;, was performed at the Carmel on 21 January 1894, and the second, &quot;Joan of Arc Accomplishes her Mission&quot;, exactly one year later, on 21 January 1895. In the estimation of one of her biographers, Ida Görres, they &quot;are scarcely veiled self-portraits&quot;. On 29 July 1894, Louis Martin died.

===The &quot;little way&quot;===
Therese entered the Carmel of Lisieux with the determination to become a saint. However, by the end of 1894, six years as a Carmelite made her realize how small and insignificant she felt. She saw the limitations of all her efforts. She remained small and very far off from the unfailing love that she would wish to practice. She is said to have understood then that it was from insignificance that she had to learn to ask God&#x27;s help. Along with her camera, Céline had brought notebooks with her, passages from the Old Testament, which Therese did not have in Carmel. (The Louvain Bible, the translation authorized for French Catholics, did not include the Old Testament.) In the notebooks Therese found a passage from Proverbs that struck her with particular force: &quot;Whosoever is a little one, let him come to me&quot; (Proverbs 9:4).

She was struck by another passage from the Book of Isaiah: &quot;you shall be carried at the breasts, and upon the knees they shall caress you. As one whom the mother caresseth, so will I comfort you&quot;. (Isaiah 66:12–13) She concluded that Jesus would carry her to the summit of sanctity. The smallness of Therese, her limits, became in this way grounds for joy, rather than discouragement. Not until Manuscript C of her autobiography did she give this discovery the name of &quot;little way&quot;, &quot;&quot;.

In her quest for sanctity and in order to attain holiness and to express her love of God, she believed that it was not necessary to accomplish heroic acts or great deeds. She wrote, &quot;Love proves itself by deeds, so how am I to show my love? Great deeds are forbidden me. The only way I can prove my love is by scattering flowers and these flowers are every little sacrifice, every glance and word, and the doing of the least actions for love.&quot;

The &quot;little way&quot; of Therese is the foundation of her spirituality. Within the Catholic Church Therese&#x27;s way was known for some time as &quot;the little way of spiritual childhood&quot;, but Therese actually wrote &quot;little way&quot; only three times, and she never wrote the phrase &quot;spiritual childhood.&quot; It was her sister Pauline who, after Therese&#x27;s death, adopted the phrase &quot;the little way of spiritual childhood&quot; to interpret Therese&#x27;s path. In May 1897, Therese wrote to Father Adolphe Roulland, &quot;... my way is entirely one of trust and love ...&quot; and:

===&quot;Merciful love&quot;===
At the end of the second play that Therese had written on Joan of Arc, the costume she wore almost caught fire. The alcohol stoves used to represent the stake at Rouen set fire to the screen behind which Therese stood. Therese did not flinch but the incident marked her. The theme of fire would assume an increasing importance in her writings. On 9 June 1895, during a Mass celebrating the feast of the Holy Trinity, Therese had a sudden inspiration that she must offer herself as a sacrificial victim to the merciful love. At this time some nuns offered themselves as a victim to God&#x27;s justice. In her cell she drew up an &quot;Act of Oblation&quot; for herself and for Céline, and on 11 June, the two of them knelt before the miraculous Virgin and Therese read the document she had written and signed. &quot;In the evening of this life, I shall appear before You with empty hands, for I do not ask You Lord to count my works.&quot;

According to biographer Ida Görres, the document echoed the happiness she had felt when Father Alexis Prou, the Franciscan preacher, had assured her that her faults did not cause God sorrow. In the Oblation she wrote, &quot;If through weakness I should chance to fall, may a glance from Your Eyes straightway cleanse my soul, and consume all my imperfections – as fire transforms all things into itself&quot;.

In August 1895 the four Martin sisters were joined in the convent by their cousin, Marie Guerin, who became Sister Marie of the Eucharist. Léonie, after several attempts, became Sister Françoise-Thérèse, a nun in the Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary in Caen, where she died in 1941.

At age 14, Therese understood her vocation was to pray for priests, to be &quot;an apostle to apostles&quot;. In September 1890, at her canonical examination before she professed her religious vows, she was asked why she had come to Carmel. She answered &quot;I came to save souls, and especially to pray for priests&quot;. Throughout her life she prayed fervently for priests, and she corresponded with and prayed for a young priest, Adolphe Roulland, and a young seminarian, Maurice Bellière. She wrote to her sister &quot;Our mission as Carmelites is to form evangelical workers who will save thousands of souls whose mothers we shall be.&quot;

In October 1895 a young seminarian and subdeacon of the White Fathers, Maurice Bellière, asked the Carmel of Lisieux for a nun who would support – by prayer and sacrifice – his missionary work, and the souls that were in the future to be entrusted to him. Mother Agnes designated Therese. She never met Bellière but ten letters passed between them.

A year later Adolphe Roulland (1870–1934) of the Paris Foreign Missions Society requested the same service of the Carmel of Lisieux, before entering the mission field of Sichuan, West China. Once more Therese was assigned the duties of &quot;spiritual sister&quot;. &quot;It is quite clear that Therese, in spite of all her reverence for the priestly office, in both cases felt herself to be the teacher and the giver. It is she who consoles and warns, encourages and praises, answers questions, offers corroboration, and instructs the priests in the meaning of her little way&quot;.

===Final years===

Therese&#x27;s final years were marked by a steady decline that she bore resolutely and without complaint. Tuberculosis was the key element of Therese&#x27;s final suffering, but she saw that as part of her spiritual journey. After observing a rigorous Lenten fast in 1896, she went to bed on the eve of Good Friday and felt a joyous sensation. She wrote: &quot;Oh! how sweet this memory really is! […] I had scarcely laid my head upon the pillow when I felt something like a bubbling stream mounting to my lips. I didn&#x27;t know what it was.&quot; The next morning her handkerchief was soaked in blood and she understood her fate. Coughing up of blood meant tuberculosis, and tuberculosis meant death. She wrote, &quot;I thought immediately of the joyful thing that I had to learn, so I went over to the window. I was able to see that I was not mistaken. Ah! my soul was filled with a great consolation; I was interiorly persuaded that Jesus, on the anniversary of His own death, wanted to have me hear His first call!&quot;

Therese corresponded with a Carmelite mission in what was then French Indochina and was invited to join them, but, because of her sickness, could not travel. Tuberculosis slowly devoured her flesh. When she was near death, &quot;her physical suffering kept increasing so that even the doctor himself was driven to exclaim, &#x27;Ah! If you only knew what this young nun was suffering!&#x27;&quot; During the last hours of Therese&#x27;s life, she said, &quot;I would never have believed it was possible to suffer so much, never, never!&quot; In July 1897, she made a final move to the monastery infirmary. On 19 August 1897, she received her last communion. She died on 30 September 1897, aged 24. On her deathbed, she is reported to have said, &quot;I have reached the point of not being able to suffer any more, because all suffering is sweet to me.&quot; Her last words were, &quot;My God, I love you!&quot;

Therese was buried on 4 October 1897, in the Carmelite plot, in the municipal cemetery at Lisieux, where her parents had been buried. Her body was exhumed in September 1910 and the remains placed in a lead coffin and transferred to another tomb. In March 1923, however, before she was beatified, her body was returned to the Carmel of Lisieux, where it remains. The figure of Therese in the glass coffin is not her actual body but a &quot;gisant&quot; statue based on drawings and photos by Céline after Therese&#x27;s death. It contains her ribcage and other remnants of her body.

==Spirituality==
Therese of Lisieux is one of the most popular Roman Catholic saints since apostolic times. She is approachable, due in part to her historical proximity. Barbara Stewart, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, once called Therese &quot;the Emily Dickinson of Roman Catholic sainthood&quot;.

As a Doctor of the Church, she is the subject of much theological comment and study, and, as a young woman whose message has touched the lives of millions, she remains the focus of much popular devotion. She was a highly influential model of sanctity for Catholics in the first half of the twentieth century because of the simplicity and practicality of her approach to the spiritual life.

Therese was devoted to Eucharistic adoration and on 26 February 1895, shortly before she died wrote from memory and without a rough draft her poetic masterpiece &quot;To Live by Love&quot; which she had composed during Eucharistic adoration. During her life, the poem was sent to various religious communities and was included in a notebook of her poems.

Therese lived a hidden life and &quot;wanted to be unknown&quot;, yet became popular after her death through her spiritual autobiography. She also left letters, poems, religious plays, prayers, and her last conversations were recorded by her sisters. Paintings and photographs – mostly the work of her sister Céline – further led to her becoming known.

Therese said on her death-bed, &quot;I only love simplicity. I have a horror of pretence&quot;, and she spoke out against some of the claims made concerning the lives of saints written in her day, &quot;We should not say improbable things, or things we do not know. We must see their real, and not their imagined lives&quot;. The depth of her spirituality, of which she said, &quot;my way is all confidence and love&quot;, has inspired many believers up to the current day. In the face of her littleness she trusted to God her sanctity. She wanted to go to heaven by an entirely new little way. &quot;I wanted to find an elevator that would raise me to Jesus&quot;. The elevator, she wrote, would be the arms of Jesus lifting her in all her littleness.

=== &quot;Story of a Soul&quot; ===

Therese is best known today for her spiritual memoir, (&quot;Story of a Soul&quot;). It is a compilation of three separate manuscripts. The first, in 1895 is a memoir of her childhood, written under obedience to the Prioress, Mother Agnes of Jesus, her older sister Pauline. Mother Agnes gave the order after being prompted by their eldest sister, Sister Marie of the Sacred Heart.

The second is a three-page letter, written in September 1896, at the request of her eldest sister Marie, who, aware of the seriousness of Therese&#x27;s illness, asked her to set down her &quot;little doctrine&quot;. In June 1897, Mother Agnes asked Mother Marie de Gonzague, who had succeeded her as prioress, to allow Therese to write another memoir with more details of her religious life (ostensibly as a help in the later composition of an anticipated obituary).

While on her deathbed Therese made a number of references to the book&#x27;s future appeal and benefit to souls. She authorized Pauline to make any changes deemed necessary. It was heavily edited by Pauline (Mother Agnes), who made more than seven thousand revisions to Therese&#x27;s manuscript and presented it as a biography of her sister. Aside from considerations of style, Mother Marie de Gonzague had ordered Pauline to alter the first two sections of the manuscript to make them appear as if they were addressed to Mother Marie as well. The book was sent out as the customary &quot;circular&quot; advising other Carmels of a nun&#x27;s death and requesting their prayers. However, it received a much wider circulation, as copies were lent out and passed around.

Since 1973, two centenary editions of Terese&#x27;s original, unedited manuscripts, including &quot;The Story of a Soul&quot;, her letters, poems, prayers and the plays she wrote for the monastery recreations have been published in French. ICS Publications has issued a complete critical edition of her writings: &quot;Story of a Soul&quot;, &quot;Last Conversations&quot;, and the two volumes of her letters were translated by John Clarke, OCD; &quot;The Poetry of Saint Thérèse&quot; by Donald Kinney, OCD; &quot;The Prayers of St. Thérèse&quot; by Alethea Kane, OCD; and &quot;The Religious Plays of St. Thérèse of Lisieux&quot; by David Dwyer and Susan Conroy.

===Holy Face of Jesus devotion===
The devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus was promoted by another Carmelite nun, Sister Marie of St Peter in Tours, France in 1844. Then by Leo Dupont, also known as the Apostle of the Holy Face who formed the Archconfraternity of the Holy Face in Tours in 1851. Therese joined this confraternity on 26 April 1885. Her parents, Louis and Zélie Martin, had also prayed at the Oratory of the Holy Face, originally established by Dupont in Tours. This devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus was based on images of the Veil of Veronica, as promoted by Dupont, rather than the Shroud of Turin, which image first appeared on a photographic negative in 1898.

On 10 January 1889, she was given the habit and received the name Therese of the Child Jesus. On 8 September 1890, Therese made her vows. The ceremony of &quot;taking the veil&quot; followed on the 24th, when she added to her religious name &quot;of the Holy Face&quot;, an attribute which was to become increasingly important in the development and character of her inner life. In his , Bishop Guy Gaucher emphasizes that Therese saw the devotions to the Child Jesus and to the Holy Face as so completely linked that she signed herself &quot;Thérèse de l&#x27;Enfant Jesus de la Sainte Face&quot;. In her poem &quot;My Heaven down here&quot;, composed in 1895, Therese expressed the notion that by the divine union of love, the soul takes on the semblance of Christ. By contemplating the sufferings associated with the Holy Face of Jesus, she felt she could become closer to Christ.

Therese composed a &quot;Consecration to the Holy Face&quot;, August 6, 1896 for herself and two other nuns in the Carmel: Geneviève of St Teresa (her biological sister Céline) and Sr Marie of the Trinity. The introduction to the consecration begins, &quot;For a little of this &quot;pure Love&quot; is more beneficial to the church than all these other works put together... Thus it is of the greatest importance that our souls be exercised much in &quot;Love&quot; so that being consumed quickly we do not linger long here on earth but soon attain to the vision of &quot;Jesus, Face to Face&quot;.&quot; This consecration greatly affected these 3 nuns, who added &quot;...and the Holy Face&quot; to their religious names. Sister Marie Agnès changed her name to Sister Marie of the Trinity and of the Holy Face and Céline years later (on November 14, 1916) received permission (from Mother Agnes of Jesus (Pauline)) to change her name to &quot;Sister Genevieve &quot;of the Holy Face&quot; and of Saint Teresa&quot; and is now most commonly known as Sr Genevieve of the Holy Face.

Therese wrote several prayers expressing her draw to Christ&#x27;s Holy Face in his passion, reflecting her desire to be like Jesus and suffer for the sake of love. She wrote a &quot;Canticle to the Holy Face&quot; in August 1895 (2 years before her death) saying: &quot;Jesus, Your ineffable image is the star that guides my steps. Ah! You know, Your sweet Face is for me Heaven on earth. My love discovers the charms of Your Face adorned with tears. I smile through my own tears when I contemplate Your sorrows.&quot;

Therese emphasized God&#x27;s mercy in both the birth (Child Jesus) and the passion (Holy Face) narratives in the Gospel. She wrote, &quot;He sees it [his face] disfigured, covered with blood! … unrecognizable! … And yet the divine Child does not tremble; this is what He chooses to show His love&quot;.

She composed the &quot;Holy Face Prayer for Sinners&quot;: &quot;Eternal Father, since Thou hast given me for my inheritance the adorable Face of Thy Divine Son, I offer that face to Thee and I beg Thee, in exchange for this coin of infinite value, to forget the ingratitude of souls dedicated to Thee and to pardon all poor sinners.&quot; Over the decades, her poems and prayers helped to spread the devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus.

==Recognition==
===Canonization===

The impact of &quot;The Story of a Soul&quot;, a collection of her autobiographical manuscripts, printed and distributed a year after her death to an initially very limited audience, was significant. Pope Pius XI made her the &quot;star of his pontificate&quot;.

Pius X signed the decree for the opening of the process of canonization on 10 June 1914. Pope Benedict XV, in order to hasten the process, dispensed with the usual fifty-year delay required between death and beatification. On 14 August 1921, he promulgated the decree on the heroic virtues of Therese declaring her venerable. She was beatified on 29 April 1923.

Therese was canonized on 17 May 1925 by Pope Pius XI, only 28 years after her death. She was declared a saint five years and a day after Joan of Arc. However, the 1925 celebration for Therese &quot;far outshone&quot; that for the legendary heroine of France. At the time, Pope Pius XI revived the old custom of covering St. Peter&#x27;s with torches and tallow lamps. According to one account, &quot;Ropes, lamps and tallows were pulled from the dusty storerooms where they had been packed away for 55 years. A few old workmen who remembered how it was done the last time – in 1870 – directed 300 men for two weeks as they climbed about fastening lamps to St. Peter&#x27;s dome.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; ran a front-page story about the occasion titled, &quot;All Rome Admires St. Peter&#x27;s Aglow for a New Saint&quot;. According to the &quot;Times&quot;, over 60,000 people, estimated to be the largest crowd inside St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica since the coronation of Pope Pius X, 22 years before, witnessed the canonization ceremonies. In the evening, 500,000 pilgrims pressed into the lit square.

She rapidly became one of the most popular saints of the twentieth century. Her feast day was added to the General Roman Calendar in 1927 for celebration on 3 October. In 1969, 42 years later, Pope Paul VI moved it to 1 October, the day after her &quot;dies natalis&quot; (birthday to heaven).

Therese of Lisieux is the patron saint of aviators, florists, illness(es) and missions. Pope Pius XI made her also the patron saint of Russian Catholics, as he declared her the co-patroness of Sant&#x27;Antonio Abate all&#x27;Esquilino – which had been attributed to the Russian Catholics – and established Therese&#x27;s feast day to be celebrated there in the Slavic rite on the anniversary of her canonization on 17 May. In 1927, Pope Pius XI named Saint Therese co-patron of the missions, with Saint Francis Xavier. In 1944, Pope Pius XII decreed her a co-patron of France with Joan of Arc.

By the apostolic letter &quot;Divini Amoris Scientia&quot; &quot;(The Science of Divine Love)&quot; of 19 October 1997, Pope John Paul II declared Therese Doctor of the Church, one of four women so named, the others being Teresa of Ávila, Catherine of Siena and Hildegard of Bingen.

Devotion to Therese has developed around the world. According to some biographies of Édith Piaf, in 1922 the singer – at the time, an unknown seven-year-old girl – was cured from blindness after a pilgrimage to the grave of Therese, who at the time was not yet formally canonized.

===Canonization of her parents===

Zélie and Louis Martin were the first spouses to be proposed for canonization as a couple and the first to be canonized together. In 2004, the Archbishop of Milan accepted the unexpected cure of Pietro Schiliro, an Italian child born near Milan in 2002 with a lung disorder, as a miracle attributable to their intercession. Announced by Cardinal Saraiva Martins on 12 July 2008, at the ceremonies marking the 150th anniversary of the marriage of the Venerable Zélie and Louis Martin, their beatification as a couple took place on 19 October 2008, in Lisieux.

In 2011, the letters of Blessed Zélie and Louis Martin were published in English as &quot;A Call to a Deeper Love: The Family Correspondence of the Parents of Saint Therese of the Child Jesus, 1863–1885&quot;. On 7 January 2013, in Valencia, Spain, the diocesan process opened to examine a &quot;presumed miracle&quot; attributed to their intercession: the healing of a newborn girl, Carmen Pérez Pons, who was born prematurely four days after their beatification and who inexplicably recovered from severe bleeding of the brain and other complications.

On 21 May 2013, the diocesan process to examine the miracle closed and the dossier was sent to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome. Louis and Zélie Martin were canonized on 18 October 2015.

===Canonization cause of her sister Léonie===
Therese&#x27;s older sister, Léonie Martin, the only one of the five sisters who did not become a Carmelite, is also a candidate for sainthood. Léonie attempted the religious life three times before her fourth and final entrance in 1899 to the convent of the Visitation in Caen. She took the name Sister Françoise-Thérèse and was a fervent disciple of Therese&#x27;s way. She died in 1941 in Caen, where her tomb in the crypt of the Visitation Monastery may be visited by the public. On 25 March 2012, Mgr Jean-Claude Boulanger, Bishop of Bayeux and Lisieux, granted the imprimatur for a prayer asking that Léonie might be declared venerable. On 2 July 2015, the diocesan inquiry into Léonie&#x27;s life and possible sanctity was opened at the chapel of the Monastery of the Visitation at Caen. She is now styled &quot;Léonie Martin, Servant of God&quot;.

===Episcopal veneration===
In 2022, Therese was officially added to the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church with a feast day on 1 October.

== Iconography ==
===Symbols===
The roses are the most traditional attribute associated with the iconography Therese of Lisieux. She is often depicted holding roses or surrounded by roses, or throwing roses from heaven, or holding a crucifix covered with roses.

In her writings, Therese often used flowers and roses as metaphors, either to refer to herself or to the acts of love she wanted to do. She referred to herself as the &quot;little flower of Jesus&quot; in the garden of God. She often referred to roses as a metaphor for the acts of love she tried to accomplish for God. Novices of the convent reported that Therese said: &quot;After my death, I will let fall a shower of roses&quot;, with roses being the symbols of the graces and blessings that she would be able to send to earth when she would be in heaven.

===Artwork===
As Céline Martin, one of Therese&#x27;s sisters who also entered the Carmel of Lisieux as Sister Genevieve, was an artist, she painted several portraits of her sister to help spread her devotion. Céline&#x27;s portraits of Therese were widely reproduced in devotional images and objects, such as prayer cards. They were also used as illustrations in several editions of &quot;Story of a Soul&quot;, her autobiography, and in books about Therese published by the Carmel of Lisieux.

Céline&#x27;s artwork include a famous portrait of Therese holding a crucifix and a bouquet of roses, made in 1912 and called &quot;Thérèse aux roses&quot; (&quot;Therese with roses&quot;). She drew this portrait because she remembered Therese unpetalling roses on her crucifix when she was lying in bed in the infirmary. It was almost considered as an &quot;official portrait&quot; as it was spread on a very large scale, with huge success among devotees, establishing Therese&#x27;s iconography.

===Photographs===
When Céline Martin joined her younger sister Therese and their two older sisters in the Carmel of Lisieux in 1894, she obtained permission to bring her photographic equipment with her and to take pictures. Between 1894 and 1897, she took 41 known photographs of Therese, both alone and with other Carmelites, being the only known photographs of her during the last years of her life. All other photographs of Therese were taken earlier, four during her childhood and two as a novice. All these photographs have been kept in the archives of the Carmel of Lisieux.

Only highly retouched photographs were made public until the death of Céline Martin, as the Carmel of Lisieux wanted Therese&#x27;s iconography to be more consistent with the traditional representation of saints. Céline, who was also the main artist creating images of her sister, believed that her artwork was a more accurate portrayal of her sister than the photographs she had taken and considered that the photos needed to be edited to better reflect Therese&#x27;s face and soul. After Céline died in 1959, all the photographs she had taken of Therese in the Carmel were released unedited, finally showing Therese&#x27;s &quot;real face&quot;.

===Statues===
After Therese was beatified in 1923, her veneration was authorized, making it possible for the Carmel of Lisieux to sell statues of Therese to churches and individuals. The Carmel commissioned a statue to Father Marie-Bernard, born Louis Richomme, inspired from the &quot;Thérèse aux roses&quot; portrait drawn by Céline Martin. It is estimated that over 300,000 copies of this statue have been distributed all over the world.

Louis Richomme was also commissioned by the Carmel for over a dozen of other sculptures of Therese, among them the original sculpture for the gisant of Therese, a &quot;Therese and the shower of roses&quot; located in the crypt of the Lisieux Basilica, and a &quot;Therese with her father&quot; in the garden of her family house in Lisieux.

==Veneration==
===Posthumous devotion===
Céline Martin entered the Lisieux convent on 14 September 1894. With Mother Agnes&#x27; permission, she brought her camera to Carmel, and developing materials. &quot;The indulgence was not by any means usual. Also outside of the normal would be the destiny of those photographs Céline would make in the Carmel, images that would be scrutinized and reproduced too many times to count. Even when the images are poorly reproduced, her eyes arrest us. Described as blue, described as gray, they look darker in photographs. Céline&#x27;s pictures of her sister contributed to the extraordinary cult of personality that formed in the years after Thérèse&#x27;s death&quot;.

In 1902, the Polish Carmelite Father Raphael Kalinowski translated her autobiography, &quot;The Story of a Soul&quot;, into Polish. As early as 1912 Father Thomas N. Taylor, a teacher at the Diocese of Glasgow seminary, wrote a short hagiography on Therese, two years before the case for her canonization would be opened. Taylor went on to become a significant proponent of devotion to &quot;The Little Flower&quot; in Scotland. As pastor of St. Francis Xavier Church in Carfin, Lanarkshire, he built a replica of the Grotto at Lourdes and included a small shrine honoring Therese with a statue donated by the Legion of Mary. Carfin became a site of pilgrimages.

===Memorial sites in Lisieux===

The city of Lisieux, where Thérèse Martin lived for the greater part of her life, is now a pilgrimage center visited by around one million visitors each year.

The Basilica of St. Thérèse in Lisieux was consecrated on 11 July 1954 and has become a centre for pilgrims from all over the world. It was originally dedicated in 1937 by Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli, later Pope Pius XII. The basilica can seat 3,000 people.

In addition to the Basilica of St. Thérèse, several places throughout the city commemorate the life of Therese, forming together with the basilica the &quot;sanctuary of Lisieux&quot;. The main places of the sanctuary include the Carmel of Lisieux, where her relics were kept, the &quot;Buissonnets&quot; family house where Therese grew up, St. Peter&#x27;s Cathedral of Lisieux where Therese used to go as a child with her family, the cemetery of Lisieux where Therese was buried before being exhumed when she was beatified. Additionally, there are several buildings in the sanctuary intended to welcome and accommodate pilgrims.

===Pilgrimage of the relics===
The relics of Saint Therese have been on an international pilgrimage since 1994. The tour included not only first-class relics, but also the saint&#x27;s religious habit, her rosary, and several other items. They were brought to Ireland in the summer of 2001. That same year they travelled to Canada. Although Cardinal Basil Hume had declined to endorse proposals for a tour in 1997, her relics finally visited England and Wales in late September and early October 2009, including an overnight stop at the Anglican York Minster on her feast day, 1 October. A quarter of a million people venerated them.

Ron Garan, who was on the May 31–June 14 &quot;Discovery&quot; shuttle mission in 2008, took a relic of Saint Therese with him, which had been given to him by the Carmelites of New Caney, Texas. The Carmelites based this on the wish of Therese &quot;to preach the Gospel on all five continents simultaneously and even to the most remote isles&quot;.

On 27 June 2010, relics of Saint Therese went on their first visit to South Africa in conjunction with the 2010 FIFA World Cup. They remained in the country until October 5, 2010.

The writing-desk Therese used at Carmel (an artifact as opposed to a relic) toured the United States in September and October 2013, sponsored by the Pontifical Mission Societies in the United States.

In November 2013, a new reliquary containing the relics of Saint Therese and of her parents, was presented to the Archdiocese of Philadelphia by the Magnificat Foundation. It was first exposed for veneration at the Magnificat Day on 9 November 2013.

The National Shrine of St. Therese in Darien, Illinois, has the largest collection of relics and personal artifacts of the saint outside of Lisieux.

Over the years, a number of prominent people have become devotees of Saint Therese of Lisieux. These include (but are not limited to) the following names listed in alphabetical order (either &quot;name in religion&quot; or &quot;first name + surname&quot;).

====Religious personalities====
Women
* Alphonsa of the Immaculate Conception or Saint Alphonsa – Poor Clare. She was canonized in 2008 by Pope Benedict XVI.
*Marie of Saint Cecilia of Rome – a Canadian member of the Religious of Jesus and Mary. Feeling very close to Therese of Lisieux, whom she considers a model, she followed her in the &quot;little way&quot;. She was beatified in 1993 by Pope John Paul II.
*Maria Candida of the Eucharist – was inspired by reading &quot;The Story of a Soul&quot;.
*Mother Teresa of Calcutta, explained her choice of the religious name Teresa as follows: &quot;I chose Therese as my namesake because she did ordinary things with extraordinary love&quot; She and Therese were both deeply drawn by the words of Christ on the Cross: &quot;I thirst&quot;.
Men
*Cardinal Francis Bourne: &quot;I love St Thérèse of Lisieux very much because she has simplified things: in our relationship with God she has done away with the mathematics&quot;.
*Daniel Brottier – the former military chaplain already had great devotion to the little Carmelite. At the time of his appointment in Auteuil Paris, he decided to build a chapel in honor of Therese who had just been beatified a few months earlier, so that the orphans could pray ... in a sanctuary worthy of her.&quot;
*Pope Francis – &quot;When I have a problem I ask the saint, not to solve it, but to take it in her hands and help me accept it.&quot;
*Albino Luciani, the future Pope John Paul I wrote a letter to Therese that was published in the Catholic newspaper in his diocese. He wrote that he was only seventeen when he read her Story of the soul who appeared to him &quot;like a bolt from the blue&quot;.
*Maximilian Kolbe offered his first Mass for the intention of the beatification and canonization of Therese of the Child Jesus and the Holy Face. He also dedicated his Asian missions to Therese.
*Marie-Joseph Lagrange – founder of Biblical School in Jerusalem
*Alfredo Obviar – Filipino bishop and founder of the Missionary Catechists of St. Therese of the Infant Jesus. Pope Francis named him as venerable in 2018. 
*Marcel Van, Servant of God, a Vietnamese Redemptorist. He reported visions of Therese. He was influenced by her spirituality. He is called &quot;The apostle of love&quot;, continuing the teachings of Therese of Lisieux&#x27;s &quot;little way&quot;. 
*Bishop William A. Wack, CSC of Pensacola-Tallahassee placed a rose in his episcopal coat of arms to signify his devotion to St. Therese.

====Laypersons====
Women
* Benedetta Bianchi Porro – Italian mystic, whose reliquary in Dovadola includes a quote of Therese, writing: &quot;I am not dying, but I am entering life&quot;, and who was read the Act of Oblation to Merciful Love on her own birthday on January 23, 1964. She was beatfied by Pope Francis in 2019.
*Louise Brooks – American dancer and actress: &quot;Her spiritual trek was guided by two New York City priests ... and by a book about the life of Saint Therese of Lisieux, &quot;Storm of Glory&quot; by John Beevers. So enamored of Saint Therese was Louise that she spent one entire Sunday propped up in bed with her easel, fashioning a portrait in charcoal on canvas from a small photo of Therese at eight. It was the best and most haunting of her dozen works of art.&quot;
*Lucie Delarue-Mardrus – French writer: &quot;the Carmelite-apparition ... appeared, roses in hand, in the midst of an era which grieves and terrifies poets ... Therese is my fellow-countrywoman, and almost my contemporary. I do not wish to let her glorious entry into sanctity pass by without honoring her in my own way. And besides, she is henceforth public property.&quot; (Introducing her book, 1926).
*Gwen John – Welsh painter &quot;Some of her final paintings were in fact of religious subjects [including] countless (over 700) tiny ink copies after a photograph of Therese of Lisieux and the saint&#x27;s elder sister&quot;.
*Édith Piaf – French singer: &quot;Shortly after her birth Édith developed a cataract. She was blind for almost three years. Her grandmother, Louise, took her to Lisieux. She saw. It was a real miracle for Édith. She always believed this. Since that time she had a real devotion to St Therese of the Child Jesus … she always had a small picture of the saint on her bedside table.&quot; (Simone Berteaut, Édith Piaf&#x27;s closest friend).
* Marthe Robin – French mystic. She said that on October 3, 1926, the first liturgical feast of Therese of Lisieux, she appeared to her three times, telling her that she would not die, that she would live and that she would continue her mission through foundations throughout the world. She was declared venerable by Pope Francis in 2014.
*Vita Sackville-West, author of &quot;The Eagle and the Dove&quot; a study of Therese of Lisieux and Teresa of Avila – admired the &quot;tough core of heroism&quot; she found in the pages of &quot;Histoire d&#x27;une âme&quot;.
* Anna Schäffer – German mystic. She was canonized by Pope Benedict XVI in 2012.
*Delia Smith – British writer: &quot;Thérèse ... not only personified the first beatitude but is, I am deeply convinced, the supreme teacher in regard to the spiritual life.&quot;
* Danica Širola - Croatian school teacher and poet, known as &quot;Croatian Little Flower&quot;

Men
*Henri Bergson – Nobel prize winner: &quot;One reason why the philosopher Henri Bergson esteemed Therese so highly was that he was fascinated by the qualities of character which prompted her to confront the Pope of her day, Leo XIII, in pursuit of her own desires ... explicitly forbidden by the chaplain to address Leo XIII, Therese flouted the injunction ... she was dragged away by two papal guards. This is hardly the simpering and docile saint which Therese&#x27;s statuary too often suggests.&quot;
*Georges Bernanos – &quot;A few months before her death, Therese wrote of &#x27;a wall rising up as far as the heavens … when I sing of the happiness of Heaven, I feel no joy, because I am simply singing of what I WANT TO BELIEVE&#x27; (Manuscripts, 248) ... Bernanos, a devotee of Therese, employs the same image in his novel &quot;The Diary of a Country Priest&quot;, where the priest confides to his diary, &quot;Behind me there was nothing, and in front of me a wall, a black wall&quot;.
* Gilbert Cesbron – French novelist. In 1952 he wrote a play called &quot;Breaking the statue&quot;, telling the story of Therese.
* Jacques Fesch – murderer of a French police officer. He was sentenced to death and executed in 1957. While in prison, he became a devout Roman Catholic.
* Henri Ghéon – French playwright, poet, writer and critic, wrote a book entitled &quot;Sainte Thérèse&quot; (1934).
* Jean Guitton – French Catholic philosopher and theologian. He expressed his attachment to Therese of Lisieux in several of his works, notably in &quot;Portrait de Marthe Robin&quot;
* Jack Kerouac – American novelist, had a boyhood habit of praying to Saint Therese and was an altar boy.
* Charles Maurras – French author, journalist, poet and political philosopher. Initially agnostic, his conversion to Catholicism was the subject of much controversy, but his attachment to Saint Therese seems to have been sincere: &quot;In some ways, Maurras was a very modern &#x27;Catholic&#x27;: he was sensitive to the &quot;little way&quot; of Therese of Lisieux.
*Alain Mimoun – Algerian-French Olympic marathon champion. He converted from Islam to Roman Catholicism in 1955. A few weeks before the 1956 Summer Olympics, he had doubts about his ability to win. In desperation, following the advice of one of his friends, he went to Lisieux to the Basilica of St. Thérèse. One month later, he won the marathon. From that day on, he was convinced that he owed this victory to the help of Saint Therese. Since then, every year on the feast day of the Saint, he has made the pilgrimage to Lisieux. He said: &quot;St Therese of Lisieux is my patron Saint. The white roses which I planted in front of her [her statue in the garden] flower almost all the year round.&quot;
* Giuseppe Moscati – Italian physician and university professor, known for his piety. He was canonised in 1987 by Pope John Paul II.
* Emmanuel Mounier – French writer and philosopher wrote about Therese of Lisieux: &quot;At a time when the petit-bourgeois spirit cannot fail to appear as the dullest antipode of the Christian life, would it not be a ruse of the Holy Spirit, [the coming of Therese], a paradox of Mercy to have hidden under these banal appearances the mysteries of the highest flame of love?&quot;.
* Giovanni Papini – Italian journalist, novelist, poet and philosopher, initially anti-clerical, he converted to Catholicism. He wrote about Therese of Lisieux in the posthumously published book &quot;Il muro dei gelsomini&quot; (&quot;The Wall of the Jasmine&quot;), published in 1957. One of the stories is entitled &quot;The Smile of the Saint&quot;. He says that as a child he was marked by the smile of a statue of a young girl, in one of the chapels of the church Santa Maria Maddalena dei Pazzi in Florence. A few years later, he discovered that this girl was in fact Therese of Lisieux, who had come on a pilgrimage to the same church in 1887 with her parents.
*Marc Sangnier – founder of Le Sillon, a social Catholic movement
* Fernando del Valle – American operatic tenor
* Maxence Van der Meersch – French Flemish writer of Catholic inspiration. He wrote a religious biography about Therese of Lisieux, entitled &quot;La petite Sainte Thérèse&quot; (1943).

<text>Sea-Doo is a Canadian brand of personal watercraft (PWC) and boats manufactured by Bombardier Recreational Products (BRP). All Sea-Doo models are driven by an impeller-driven waterjet. All Sea-Doo PWC models are produced at BRP&#x27;s plants in Querétaro and Juárez, Mexico. Its Rotax engines are produced at BRP&#x27;s plant in Gunskirchen, Austria. In 2016, Sea-Doo had a 45.8% share of the PWC market in the US.

==History==

Bombardier introduced its first personal watercraft in 1968, called the Bombardier Sea-Doo. It was designed by Clayton Jacobson II, who would later develop the more successful Kawasaki Jet Ski watercraft. Also heavily involved was Bombardier&#x27;s Laurent Beaudoin, who was interested in expanding the success of the Ski-Doo snowmobile to the PWC market. Advertised as the &quot;Jet-powered Aqua Scooter&quot;, the original yellow Sea-Doo was 5 feet wide and 7.5 feet long, somewhat resembling a flying saucer. In 1968, it was powered by an air-cooled, 320cc engine with a top speed of 25 mph. Following complaints of overheating and inefficiency, it was replaced in 1969 with a water-cooled 372cc engine. There were common complaints about discomfort from its flat seat and minimally-padded Ski-Doo supplied stainless steel handlebars. After only two years on the market, it was discontinued.

The Sea-Doo was re-introduced in 1988 as its own brand under Bombardier. By 1995, annual sales for the Sea-Doo reached over 100,000 units, signaling a turnaround in the company&#x27;s declining sales. By 1997 the company had $212 million in sales, recapturing over half of the PWC market. In 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Sea-Doo personal watercraft converted into explosive unmanned surface vehicles were used to attack Russian naval vessels at the Sevastopol Naval Base.

==Models== 
There are five categories of Sea-Doo models: Recreation, Tow Sports, Touring, Sport Fishing, and Performance.

The Sea-Doo jet-powered sport boats included a four-seater Sportster 150 with 155 hp or 215 hp, a four-seater Speedster 150 with 255 hp, and a seven-seater Speedster 200 with 310 hp, and a Speedster 230 with space for up to twelve people. The Wake 200 model was made for wakeboarding and the two Challenger models were less sporty and more luxurious: a smaller Challenger 180 and a larger Challenger 210. In 2012, BRP discontinued sport boat production, citing a decline in global sales in the marine industry. This meant the loss of 350 jobs, including most of those at a plant in Benton, Illinois.

The Sea-Doo Spark which was released in 2014 was aimed to attract new buyers to the decreasing PWC market. This model was in development for eight years and was code-named CAFE (clean, affordable, fun, and easy to use). It used a unique polytec hull and deck structure to cut costs and weight. The Spark quickly became the best-selling Sea-Doo model.

In August 2021 they released a Pontoon boat style boat called the Switch.

<doc id="338266" wikidata="Q7203250" url="?curid=338266" title="Player's Ball">
<text>&quot;Player&#x27;s Ball&quot; is the debut single from hip hop duo Outkast. Originally released two weeks prior on the compilation &quot;A LaFace Family Christmas&quot;, the single was released on November 19, 1993, to promote the forthcoming debut album, &quot;Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik&quot;. The song itself discusses the nature of living in the South of the United States, and growing up within a hip hop culture. The accompanying music video was directed by Sean &quot;Puff Daddy&quot; Combs.

The title refers to a traditional gathering of pimps in Atlanta. The song is referenced at least three times within other songs by the duo, including the final track on the debut album, the title track of the debut album, and a later single, &quot;Elevators (Me &amp; You)&quot;. The song peaked at #37 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, making it the highest-charting single from the group&#x27;s debut album.

When Outkast made a guest appearance on &quot;Martin&quot; in the February 1995 episode &quot;All The Players Came&quot;, they also performed the song during the credits. The song was later featured in the 2002 film &quot;8 Mile&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
The single was certified gold on May 12, 1994, selling over 500,000 copies.

<text>Victoria station, also known as London Victoria, is a central London railway terminus and connected London Underground station in Victoria, in the City of Westminster, managed by Network Rail. Named after the nearby Victoria Street, the mainline station is a terminus of the Brighton Main Line to and and the Chatham Main Line to and Dover via . From the main lines, trains can connect to the Catford Loop Line, the Dartford Loop Line, and the Oxted line to and . Southern operates most commuter and regional services to south London, Sussex and parts of east Surrey and south-east Hampshire while Southeastern operates trains to south-east London and Kent, alongside limited services operated by Thameslink. Gatwick Express trains run direct to Gatwick. The London Underground station is served by three lines: Circle, District and Victoria. On the Circle and District lines, the station is between and stations. On the Victoria line, it is between and stations. The area around the station is an important interchange for other forms of transport: a local bus station is in the forecourt and Victoria Coach Station is nearby, which serves national and international coaches.

Victoria was built to serve both the Brighton and Chatham Main Lines, and has always had a &quot;split&quot; feel of being two separate stations. The Brighton station opened in 1860 with the Chatham station following two years later. It replaced a temporary terminus at Pimlico, and construction involved building the Grosvenor Bridge over the River Thames. It became immediately popular as a London terminus, causing delays and requiring upgrades and rebuilding. It was well known for luxury Pullman train services and continental boat-train trips, and became a focal point for soldiers during World War I.

As at other London termini, steam trains were phased out of Victoria by the 1960s, to be replaced by suburban electric and diesel multiple-unit services; all services from the station are currently operated using third rail electric multiple units. Despite the end of international services following the opening of the Channel Tunnel, Victoria still remains an important London terminal station. The connected Underground station, in particular, suffered from overcrowding, until a major upgrade was completed in the late 2010s. Gatwick Express provides half-hourly non-stop direct services between London Victoria and Gatwick Airport. However Southern services run more frequent semi-fast services to Gatwick Airport.

==Location==
The station complex is in Victoria in the City of Westminster, immediately south of the London Inner Ring Road. It is located south of Victoria Street, east of Buckingham Palace Road and west of Vauxhall Bridge Road. Several railways lead into the station line by way of Grosvenor Bridge from the south west, south and south east. It is in Travelcard Zone 1 and is one of 19 stations managed by Network Rail. It has been a Grade II listed building since 1970.

Victoria Coach Station is about 300 metres south-west of the railway stations. It is the main London coach terminal and serves all parts of the UK and mainland Europe.

London Buses routes 2, 3, 6, 11, 13, 24, 26, 36, 38, 44, 52, 148, 170, 185, 390, C1, C10 and night routes N2, N11, N26, N32, N38, N44 and N136 serve the station at Victoria bus station or neighbouring streets.

==History==

===Background===

By 1850, railways serving destinations to the south of London had three termini available – , and Waterloo. All three were inconvenient for Central London as they terminated south of the river Thames, whereas the main centres of population, business and government were north of the river in the City of London, the West End and Westminster.

Victoria Station was designed in a piecemeal fashion to help address this problem for the London Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&amp;SCR) and the London Chatham and Dover Railway (LC&amp;DR). It consisted of two adjacent main line railway stations which, from the viewpoint of passengers, were unconnected.

===Early history===

The London and Brighton Railway terminus at London Bridge provided reasonable access to the City of London but was inconvenient for travellers to and from Westminster. As early as 1842 John Urpeth Rastrick had proposed that the railway should build a branch to serve the West End, but his proposal was unsuccessful.

However, the transfer of the Crystal Palace from Hyde Park to Sydenham Hill between 1851 and 1854 created a major tourist attraction in the then rural area south of London, and the LB&amp;SCR opened a branch line from the Brighton Main Line at Sydenham to the site in 1854. While this was under construction the West End of London and Crystal Palace Railway also planned a line from Crystal Palace, to a new station at Battersea Wharf, at the southern end of the new Chelsea Bridge. Despite its location, the new station was called Pimlico. It opened on 27 March 1858, but was very much regarded as a temporary terminus, composed of a small number of wooden huts, and positioned immediately next to a proposed bridge over the Thames. Shortly afterwards the LB&amp;SCR leased most of the lines of the new railway, and built a further connection from Crystal Palace to the Brighton Main Line at Norwood Junction, thereby providing itself with a route into west London, although it was recognised that a terminus would be needed on the north side of the river.
During the summer of 1857 a scheme for an independent &quot;Grosvenor Basin Terminus&quot; in the West End of London, &quot;for the use of the Southern Railways of England&quot; was mooted. The station was originally referred to as the &quot;Grosvenor Terminus&quot; but later renamed Victoria as it was sited at the end of Victoria Street. Three other railway companies were also seeking a terminus in Westminster: the Great Western (GWR), the London &amp; North Western (LNWR), and the East Kent Railway (EKR). The first two already had rail access to Battersea through their joint ownership of the West London Line with the LB&amp;SCR. In 1858, the EKR leased the remaining lines of the West End of London and Crystal Palace Railway from Shortlands railway station, and also negotiated temporary running powers over the lines recently acquired by the LB&amp;SCR, pending the construction of its own line into west London. On 23 July 1859 these four companies together formed the Victoria Station and Pimlico Railway (VS&amp;PR) company, with the object of extending the railway from Stewarts Lane Junction, Battersea across the river to a more convenient location nearer the West End, and the following month the EKR changed its name to the London Chatham and Dover Railway.

The new line followed part of the route of the Grosvenor Canal with Victoria station on the former canal basin. It required the construction of a new bridge over the Thames, originally known as Victoria Bridge and later as Grosvenor Bridge. The bridge was long, which was required so that it could clear all river traffic. It was designed by John Fowler. The line was built as mixed gauge from Longhedge Junction, Battersea, to cater for GWR trains. It required a 1-in-50 climb and a turn from the LSWR main line to reach the bridge. The LB&amp;SCR had hoped to amalgamate with the VS&amp;PR, and introduced a parliamentary bill to allow it to do so in 1860. This was opposed by the GWR and LC&amp;DR and rejected. By way of compromise the LB&amp;SCR was permitted to lease Victoria station from the VS&amp;PR, but agreed to accommodate the other railways until a terminus could be built for them on an adjoining site.
The LB&amp;SCR side of Victoria station opened on 1 October 1860, the temporary terminus in Battersea having closed the day before. The station was designed by Robert Jacomb Hood. It consisted of six platforms and ten tracks, with an entrance on Victoria Street. The site then covered and was long and wide. The roof was built on a set of wrought iron girders, with an additional safety row that would allow the main girders to withstand a train strike. On the northwest corner of the station was the 300-bedroom Grosvenor Hotel. It was designed by J. T. Knowles, and run independently of the station itself. It opened in 1861. The LCDR and GWR opened their own station on 25 August 1862, occupying a less imposing wooden-fronted building with an entrance on Wilton Road. The Chatham line station had eight platforms, five of which were of mixed gauge, shared by broad-gauge trains of the GWR from Windsor via Southall.

===Post-opening===
Victoria station proved to be unexpectedly popular for both the main companies, and by 1862 there were frequent delays due to congestion at Stewarts Lane Junction. In March 1863 the LB&amp;SCR and the LC&amp;DR jointly funded a new high-level route into Victoria, avoiding Stewarts Lane and requiring the widening of Grosvenor Bridge, including the replacement of the broad-gauge rails with a third LB&amp;SCR line. The work was completed during 1867/8. The South Eastern Railway (SER) wanted to use Victoria as a London terminus as it was more convenient than London Bridge, but were advised they would need to pay extensive tolls and expenses to do so. Consequently, the SER constructed a station at instead.

The GWR began services on 1 April 1863, connecting Victoria to Southall, and later some services to Uxbridge, , and Windsor. From 13 August 1866 the LB&amp;SCR ran services from Victoria to London Bridge along the newly completed South London Line. The Great Northern Railway began a service from Victoria to Barnet (via ) on 1 March 1868, with other cross-London services running via Victoria in the 1870s.

In 1898 the LB&amp;SCR decided to demolish its station and replace it with an enlarged red-brick Renaissance-style building, designed by Charles Langbridge Morgan. Since widening of the station was prevented by the LC&amp;DR station and Buckingham Palace Road, increased capacity was achieved by lengthening the platforms and building crossovers to allow two trains to use each platform simultaneously. Work was completed in 1908, and included the rebuilding of the Grosvenor Hotel at the same time. The site then covered with of platforms. Overhead electric trains began to run into Victoria on 1 December 1909, to London Bridge. The line to Crystal Palace was electrified on 12 May 1911.

Victoria became well known for its Pullman services during the late 19th century. The LB&amp;SCR introduced the first Pullman first-class service to Brighton on 1 November 1875, followed by the first all-Pullman train in the UK on 1 December 1881. Another all-Pullman service was introduced in 1908 under the name of the Southern Belle, then described as &quot;... the most luxurious train in the world...&quot;. The SECR began Pullman continental services on 21 April 1910 and on domestic services to the Kent coast on 16 June 1919. The Golden Arrow, another all-Pullman train began services in 1924, and remained in service until 30 September 1972.

The LC&amp;DR and GWR jointly leased the &#x27;Chatham&#x27; portion of the station for 999 years from 28 June 1860, with the GWR responsible for 6.67%. The LC&amp;DR completed its main line as far as Canterbury on 3 December 1860 and began to use the LB&amp;SCR station on that day.
From 1899 the LC&amp;DR entered a working union with its rival, the South Eastern Railway, to form the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR). As a result, services from its station at Victoria began to be rationalised and integrated with those from the other SECR termini.

The LC&amp;DR station began to be reconstructed in the late 19th century after several properties on Buckingham Palace Road, and the hotel, were bought by the company. Work began in 1899 with the removal of the old roof. The rebuilt station was partially opened on 10 June 1906, with additional platforms and cab exit on 10 February the following year, along with a new annexe to the hotel. It was formally re-opened on 1 July 1908. As a consequence of the rebuilding, boat trains become more popular from Victoria compared to Charing Cross and Cannon Street. Services increased to serve Ostend and Calais via Dover and Rotterdam via Gravesend. The LB&amp;SCR part of the station also served Dieppe via Newhaven.

Victoria has since seen more visits from royalty and heads of state than any other London station. During the funeral of Edward VII, seven kings, over 20 princes and five archdukes were greeted here.

In the early 20th century, the development and improvement of the London Underground, meant that Victoria could not compete as a cross-London service. GNR trains stopped running on 1 October 1907, with Midland ones following in June the next year. The GWR ceased to use the station for scheduled services on 21 March 1915, partly due to World War I in addition to the new Underground lines. Victoria was used as the main station for drafted soldiers, and those returning from action in the war. By the middle of the war, the station served twelve trains a day running between Victoria and Folkestone, with additional trains serving Dover. The station was regularly served with a voluntary buffet for departing soldiers, who served up to 4,000 men a day. Victoria itself did not suffer significant damage during the war, but a section of Grosvenor Bridge was destroyed after an anti-aircraft shell struck a gas main underneath it.

Following the war, memorials were built on both parts of the station. The Southern Railway side marks 626 soldiers killed or missing, while the Chatham side marks 556. A plaque marks the arrival of the body of The Unknown Warrior at Victoria on 10 November 1920.

The service to Ostend via Dover was re-introduced on 18 January 1919. Civilian trains to Boulogne via Folkestone restarted on 3 February. Boat train services to Newhaven started on 1 June, and a connection with Paris started on 15 July. On 8 January 1920, Victoria replaced Charing Cross as the main station for continental services, as it had more facilities and closer locomotive and carriage facilities. The service to Paris via Calais and Dover began on the same day.

===Southern Railway===

The two stations at Victoria came largely under single ownership in 1923 with the formation of the Southern Railway (SR) as part of the Big Four grouping. The following year steps were taken to integrate the two stations. The platforms were renumbered in a single sequence, openings were made in the wall separating them to allow passengers to pass from one to the other without going into the street, and alterations were made to the tracks to allow for interchangeable working. The work was completed in 1925, and all platforms were renumbered in a contiguous sequence. Electric suburban services to Herne Hill and Orpington first ran on 12 July that year, followed by South London line services on 17 June 1928, and electric services to Crystal Palace and (via ) on 3 March 1929. The SR also concentrated continental steamer traffic at Victoria, introducing the Golden Arrow, in 1924, and the Night Ferry in 1936.
The station had a news cinema (later a cartoon cinema) that showed a continuous programme. The cinema was designed by Alister MacDonald, son of the Prime Minister Ramsay, and was in operation from 1933 until it was demolished in 1981. The GWR remained part-owner of the station until 1932 thereafter retaining running powers, although it does not appear to have used them.

Night-train services stopped running from Victoria on 4 September 1939 after World War II was declared, and other services were terminated following the German invasion of France in May 1940. Though the station was bombed several times in 1940 and 1941, there was not enough damage to prevent operations. A plane crashed into the eastern side of the station on 15 September 1940 and a flying bomb caused partial damage on 27 June 1944.

The greatest change to the station during the 1920s and 1930s was the introduction of third-rail electrification for all suburban and many main-line services, replacing the original LB&amp;SCR overhead scheme by 1929 and largely replacing steam traction, except on Chatham Section main-line and Oxted line trains. Services to were electrified in 1925 and to Epsom the following year. By 1932 the Brighton Main Line was electrified, quickly followed by those to other Sussex coastal towns and Portsmouth by 1938. The brand name &quot;Southern Electric&quot; was applied to all these services. The Brighton Belle, the first electric all-Pullman service in the world, ran from Victoria from 29 June 1934 until its withdrawal in 1972.

===Nationalisation===

British Railways (BR) took over the station on 1 January 1948. A new set of offices for Continental trains opened on 14 June, while the eastern booking hall was renovated, opening on 5 February 1951.

During the 1950s and early 1960s British Railways (Southern Region) completed its Kent Coast Electrification schemes, which meant that most of the remaining services from the station were electrified, including boat trains. Some minor services were withdrawn, and the few remaining steam services, to Oxted and beyond, were replaced by diesel-electric multiple units. Various plans were proposed at this time to redevelop Victoria, including new offices, hotels and a helicopter station. The last steam service left Victoria on 8 January 1964 to , after which it was replaced by diesel-electric multiple units.

The station was redeveloped internally in the 1980s, with the addition of shops within the concourse, and above the western platforms as the &quot;Victoria Place&quot; shopping centre and of office space. Platforms 16 and 17 opened on the site of the former taxi rank on 21 December 1987. A major re-signalling scheme was carried out during the works. The station was managed by Network SouthEast also under British Rail.
The other major change to the station under BR was the gradual development of services to Gatwick Airport station after its opening on 28 May 1958. A dedicated rail-air terminal opened on top of platform 15 on 1 May 1962, designed by Clive Pascall.

Several long-standing services from Victoria ended during the BR era. The &quot;Brighton Belle&quot;&#x27;s final service was on 30 April 1972, followed by the last &quot;Golden Arrow&quot; on 30 September. The &quot;Night Ferry&quot; lasted until 31 October 1980, though the Venice-Simplon Orient Express, a luxury Pullman service, has been running intermittently since 1982.

In 1984 the non-stop Gatwick Express service was started, aiming for a 30-minute journey time. This was coupled with the provision of an airport lounge and check-in facilities at first-floor level, with dedicated escalators down to the Gatwick Express platforms. British Airways and other major airlines had their own check-in desks there. British Rail operated an International Travel Centre within the main station, separate from the domestic travel centre. At the time, Victoria was still a major departure point for international travel, with boat trains to Dover and Folkestone for France and Belgium and beyond. This ceased with the introduction of Eurostar in 1994, which did not serve Victoria, and the International Travel Centre closed.

==Services==
In 2019/20, Victoria was the second-busiest station in the UK, with an estimated 73.6 million passenger entries/exits. However, as with other stations, patronage dropped dramatically as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The estimated usage figure fell 81% in 2020/21 to 13.8 million, although Victoria retained its rank in second place, behind .

Operationally, there are two separate main line termini:

* The eastern (Chatham) side, comprising platforms 1–8, is the terminus for Southeastern services to Kent on the Chatham Main Line and its branches. This is also the London terminus for the Venice-Simplon Orient Express, from Platform 2, the longest platform. It was used for boat trains to Dover and Folkestone until these were made redundant by the introduction of Eurostar trains to the continent in 1994.
* The western (Brighton) side, comprising platforms 9–19, is the terminus for Southern and Gatwick Express services to Surrey, Sussex and parts of southern Hampshire including Gatwick Airport and Brighton on the Brighton Main Line and the East Grinstead branch on the Oxted Line.

Services are operated by Southeastern and Southern, owned by the Department for Transport and Govia respectively. All services at Victoria use electric multiple unit trains.

To help passengers choose the correct service, the floor of the main concourse at Victoria was marked with different coloured lines. Passengers could then follow the line marked with the specific colour for that service to arrive at their intended departure point.

===Southeastern===
Southeastern services at Victoria use platforms 1–8. The station is served by a mixture of metro and long distance (mainline) services. Metro services are operated using Class 465 and 466 EMUs whilst mainline services are operated using Class 375 and 377 EMUs.

As of December 2024, the typical off-peak service run by Southeastern in trains per hour (tph) is:

* 4 tph to via Beckenham Junction 
* 2 tph to via 
* 1 tph to via Faversham
* 1 tph to via Faversham
* 1 tph to Gillingham via 
* 1 tph to Ashford International via Maidstone East

===Southern===
Southern services at Victoria use platforms 9-12 and 15-19 as of August 2022. The station is served by a mixture of metro and long-distance (mainline) services. Southern metro and mainline services are both operated by Class 377 EMUs and Gatwick Express is serviced by Class 387 EMUs.

From 4 September, the typical off-peak service run by Southern in trains per hour (tph) is:
* 2 tph to London Bridge via 
* 2 tph to via Sutton and 
* 2 tph to West Croydon via Crystal Palace
* 2 tph to via Epsom and Sutton of which 1 continues to 
* 2 tph to via 
* 2 tph to via 
* 2 tph to and , dividing at Horsham
* 2 tph to via 
* 2 tph to via of which 1 continues to 

During the suspension of the Gatwick Express, Southern services at Victoria began to use Platforms 13 and 14 as well as operating the Gatwick Express fleet of Class 387 units. Gatwick Express services were reinstated in March 2022.

===Gatwick Express===
Gatwick Express, formerly a separate franchise but now operated by Southern, runs services from platforms 13 and 14. Ticket barriers were installed on these platforms in 2011.

As of September 2022, the typical off-peak service run by Gatwick Express in trains per hour (tph) is:

* 2 tph to Brighton (calling only at Gatwick Airport and Haywards Heath)

In the peak hours, Gatwick Express services call at intermediate stations between Haywards Heath and Brighton such as Preston Park, Hassocks and Burgess Hill.





==Accidents and incidents==

On 26 February 1884, an explosion occurred in the cloakroom of the Brighton side injuring seven staff, as part of the Fenian dynamite campaign.

On 27 August 1910, an empty LB&amp;SCR stock train derailed due to inadequate signalling arrangements, leading to four injuries.

On 26 July 1939, as part of the IRA&#x27;s S-Plan, bombs exploded in the luggage office at King&#x27;s Cross and then in the cloakroom at Victoria. Five were wounded at Victoria; at King&#x27;s Cross, one man was killed and 17 people severely wounded.

In the early 1940s, a German Nazi plane crashed into the station courtyard but there were no deaths. The plane was later displayed at the Imperial war museum.

On 17 July 1946, a light engine collided with a passenger train; several people were injured.

On 15 December 1959, a passenger train collided with a rake of parcels vans. At least eleven people were injured.

On 8 September 1973, a Provisional Irish Republican Army bomb exploded at the ticket office, injuring four people.
On the afternoon of 23 March 1988, Deborah Linsley was found brutally stabbed to death on a train arriving at platform 2 at Victoria. She had boarded the Orpington-Victoria service at Petts Wood. A French au pair heard screaming from the compartment next to her on the final leg of the journey between Brixton and Victoria. Several people, including the au pair, reported seeing a suspicious blond or ginger-haired man walking from the train and washing cuts on his face in the toilet of the station, while there were also sightings of a man seen staring at women boarding the train at Orpington and changing compartments at Penge East, possibly into Linsley&#x27;s compartment. Despite the killer&#x27;s DNA being known since 2002, the murder remains unsolved as of August 2022. There remains a £10,000 reward on offer for information leading to the capture of the killer.

On 18 February 1991, an IRA bomb exploded in a litter bin, killing David Corner, and injuring 38. A general bomb warning for all main-line stations had been received by telephone at 0700, but the Metropolitan Police Anti-Terrorist Branch chose not to close the stations.

In 2009 a woman was found by a Police Community Support Officer (PCSO) acting suspiciously. When approached she produced a gun and pointed it at a passing young child. Unarmed PCSO George McNaught of the Metropolitan Police wrestled the gun out of the woman&#x27;s hands before overpowering and detaining her. The woman was arrested and PCSO McNaught was awarded the commendation of the High Sheriff of Greater London for his brave actions. He is the first PCSO to receive the award.

In March 2010, a youth was stabbed to death in Victoria Underground station, in front of numerous witnesses. Eight people were convicted of the killing in 2013. Three defendants were found guilty of murder and five were convicted of manslaughter.

The former British ambassador to the US, Sir Christopher Meyer, said he was attacked on a Tube platform at the station in July 2018. Two teenagers were arrested and then bailed by police. However, a witness subsequently claimed that Meyer was injured after accidentally falling over.

On 8 May 2019, Class 377 electric multiple unit 377 142 collided with the buffer stops.

On 22 March 2020, during the global COVID-19 pandemic, a ticket office worker, Belly Mujinga along with another female staff member, were repeatedly coughed and spat on by a male member of the public, who claimed to have COVID-19. A few days later, both Mujinga and the fellow worker fell ill with the virus. Mujinga had underlying respiratory issues and was eventually admitted to Barnet General Hospital and put on a ventilator. She died on 5 April 2020, aged 47. The police interviewed a 57-year-old man, who tested negative for the virus. No further action was taken as it was discovered that the incident was not a cause of Mujinga&#x27;s death, as well as senior detectives concluding that &quot;there is no evidence to substantiate any criminal offences having taken place&quot;.

==London Underground station==
There are two connected Underground stations at Victoria, on different levels and built more than a century apart. The older one, on the north side of the bus station, serves the Circle and District lines, constructed by &#x27;cut and cover&#x27; methods just below road level. The newer station, closer to the main line station, serves the Victoria line, a deep-level tube. Each has its own ticket hall, and the two are connected by a pedestrian passage beneath the bus station.

Victoria is currently the station on the London Underground with million passengers using the station in . The station was not built for this number of passengers, which resulted in overcrowding requiring crowd control measures to be implemented at busy times. A £700 million upgrade of the station was completed in 2018, which doubled the size of the existing station, as well as providing step-free access.

===Circle and District lines===
The first part of the station was opened on 24 December 1868 by the District Railway (DR, now the District line) when the company opened the first section of its line, between and . The DR connected to the Metropolitan Railway (MR, later the Metropolitan line) at South Kensington and, although the two companies were rivals, each company operated trains over the other&#x27;s tracks in a joint service known as the &quot;Inner Circle&quot;. The line was operated by steam locomotives, creating the necessity to leave periodic gaps open to the air.

On 1 February 1872, the DR opened a northward branch from to the West London Extension Joint Railway (WLEJR, now the West London Line) at Addison Road (now Kensington (Olympia)). From that date the &quot;Outer Circle&quot; service began running over the DR. The service was run by the North London Railway (NLR) from Broad Street (now demolished) in the City of London via the North London Line to , then the West London Line to Addison Road and the DR to , the new eastern terminus of the DR.

From 1 August 1872, the &quot;Middle Circle&quot; service also began operation through Victoria, from Moorgate along the MR on the north side of the Inner Circle to Paddington, then over the Hammersmith &amp; City Railway (H&amp;CR) to Latimer Road and then to Mansion House. On 30 June 1900, the Middle Circle service was withdrawn between Earl&#x27;s Court and Mansion House. On 31 December 1908 the Outer Circle service was also withdrawn.

The original DR station was rebuilt at the beginning of the 20th century, initially as a single-storey structure to the design of architect George Campbell Sherrin. An office building was built above it later. The line was electrified in 1905. In 1949, the Inner Circle route was given its own identity on the tube map as the Circle line.

===Victoria line===

Plans for the route that eventually became the Victoria line date from the 1940s. A proposal for a new underground railway line linking north-east London with the centre was included in the &quot;County of London Plan&quot; in 1943. Between 1946 and 1954, a series of routes were proposed by different transport authorities to connect various places in south and north or north-east London. Each of these connected the three main-line termini at King&#x27;s Cross, Euston and Victoria. A route was approved in 1955 with future extensions to be decided later, though funding for the construction was not approved by the government until 1962.

As part of the construction of the Victoria line, a new ticket hall was constructed just outside the main railway building. From the ticket hall, a set of escalators led down to the new Victoria line. The Victoria line station opened on 7 March 1969, when the third phase of the line began operating, south of . Victoria was the terminus while the final phase was under construction to . This opened on 23 July 1971.

There are two sidings to the south of the Victoria line platforms plus another crossover to the north to enable trains to terminate and turn back north.

===Station upgrade and expansion===
Following growth in passenger numbers in the 2000s, Victoria Underground station became one of the busiest on the Underground, with around 80 million passengers a year. At rush hour, more than 30,000 passengers entered the station between 8 and 9am, and entrances to the station were frequently closed due to dangerous levels of overcrowding at platform level.

TfL subsequently upgraded and expanded the station at a cost of £700m between 2011 and 2018 to alleviate overcrowding and to provide step-free access. The work included expansion of the existing south &quot;Victoria line&quot; ticket hall, an additional entrance and ticket hall under Bressenden Place, new and replaced escalators, renovation and expansion work throughout the existing station, and step-free access. Overall, the work expanded the station by 110%, with 9 new escalators and 7 new lifts.

Although contributors to the public inquiry into the upgrade criticised that access to platforms was long and/or indirect compared to the direct access using the existing escalators, the work was permitted in July 2009. Construction began in 2011, and tunnelling for the project was completed in 2015 after complex work; tunnelling took place 60 cm from the existing District and Circle line tunnels.

The first phase of the project opened in January 2017, with a new entrance leading to a North Ticket Hall underneath Bressenden Place, linked to the Victoria line by new escalators and lifts. The work was undertaken by a joint venture of BAM Nuttall and Taylor Woodrow Construction. In January 2018, the second phase of the project opened, with a new entrance at Wilton Road in front of the mainline station and the expanded Victoria line ticket hall. The main project was completed in October 2018, when step free access between all lines was completed. Work to reinstate the bus station and the historic Duke of York public house continued until 2019.

===Future===
Victoria is a proposed stop on Crossrail 2, the route of which has been safeguarded since 1991. The project would involve the construction of two new long platforms, and new entrances onto Ebury Street and the main National Rail station. The District and Circle line ticket hall would be expanded and include a direct connection to the new Crossrail station. Crossrail 2 trains would also be able to reverse at Victoria. The service proposes to run 30 additional trains per hour through the station, which is expected to reduce crowding in Victoria by 25%.

The Docklands Light Railway has also been proposed to be linked with Victoria. This would be a continuation of the line from via , with another branch to . As of 2020, these extensions of the DLR are not being progressed.

In January 2020, Victoria BID – the local Business improvement district – proposed removing the bus station from the mainline station forecourt to create a new &quot;Station Square&quot;. Bus stops would be relocated to nearby streets.

==Cultural references==
Victoria station is mentioned in Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; as the location where Jack Worthing was found by Thomas Cardew. In describing this to Lady Bracknell, Jack clarifies he was named because Cardew had a ticket to , and clarifies this as &quot;the Brighton line&quot; (that is, the LB&amp;SCR station, as opposed to the LC&amp;DR one).

The station is mentioned in the Sherlock Holmes short story &quot;The Final Problem&quot;, when Dr Watson catches a Continental Express train from Victoria to avoid Moriarty and his henchmen.

The Harold Pinter short play &quot;Victoria Station&quot; has the station as the intended destination that the driver never reaches.

<text>In biology, setae (; seta ; ) are any of a number of different bristle- or hair-like structures on living organisms.

==Animal setae==

===Protostomes===
Annelid setae are stiff bristles present on the body. They help, for example, earthworms to attach to the surface and prevent backsliding during peristaltic motion. These hairs make it difficult to pull a worm straight from the ground. Setae in oligochaetes (a group including earthworms) are largely composed of chitin. They are classified according to the limb to which they are attached; for instance, notosetae are attached to notopodia; neurosetae to neuropodia.

Diptera setae are bristles present throughout the body and function as mechanoreceptors.

Crustaceans have mechano- and chemosensory setae. Setae are especially present on the mouthparts of crustaceans and can also be found on grooming limbs. In some cases, setae are modified into scale like structures. Setae on the legs of krill and other small crustaceans help them to gather phytoplankton. It captures them and allows them to be eaten.

Setae on the integument of insects are unicellular, meaning that each is formed from a single epidermal cell of a type called a trichogen, literally meaning &quot;bristle generator&quot;. They are at first hollow and in most forms remain hollow after they have hardened. They grow through and project through a secondary or accessory cell of a type called a tormogen, which generates the special flexible membrane that connects the base of the seta to the surrounding integument. Depending partly on their form and function, setae may be called hairs, macrotrichia, chaetae, or scales. The setal membrane is not cuticularized and movement is possible. Some insects, such as &quot;Eriogaster lanestris&quot; larvae, use setae as a defense mechanism, as they can cause dermatitis when they come into contact with skin.

===Deuterostomes===
====Vertebrates====

The pads on a gecko&#x27;s feet are small hair-like processes that play a role in the animal&#x27;s ability to cling to vertical surfaces. The micrometer-scale setae branch into nanometer-scale projections called spatulae. A Tokay gecko&#x27;s two front feet can sustain 20.1 N of force parallel to the surface using approximately 14,400 setae per mm2. This equates to ~ 6.2 pN per seta, but does not sufficiently account for the overall stickiness behavior shown by the foot pads.

=== Classification uncertain ===
In 2017, a description of a new species of basal deuterostome called &quot;Saccorhytus&quot; was published. This animal appears to have seta in the pores along the side of its body. However, in 2022, &quot;Saccorhytus&quot; is considered to be an early ecdysozoan, and was described as having &quot;lacked setae&quot;.

==Fungal setae==
In mycology, &quot;setae&quot; refer to dark-brown, thick-walled, thornlike cystidia found in corticioid and poroid fungi in the family Hymenochaetaceae. Though mainly microscopic, the setae of some species may be sufficiently prominent to be visible with a hand lens.

==Plant setae==
In botany, &quot;seta&quot; refers to the stalk supporting the capsule of a moss or liverwort (both closely related in a clade called &quot;Setaphyta&quot;), and supplying it with nutrients. The seta is part of the sporophyte and has a short foot embedded in the gametophyte on which it is parasitic. Setae are not present in all mosses, but in some species they may reach 15 to 20 centimeters in height.

==Chaetoceros setae==
In the diatom family Chaetocerotaceae, &quot;seta&quot; refers to the hairlike outgrowths of the valve, i.e. of the face of the cells. These setae have a different structure than the valve. Such setae may prevent rapid sinking and also protect the cells from grazing.

==Synthetic setae==
Synthetic setae are a class of synthetic adhesives that detach at will, sometimes called resettable adhesives, yet display substantial stickiness. The development of such synthetic materials is a matter of current research.

* Chaeta
*Synthetic setae
* Van der Waals force

<text>Mila 18 is a historical novel by Leon Uris set in German-occupied Warsaw, Poland, before and during World War II. &quot;Mila 18&quot; debuted at #7 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list and peaked at #2 in August 1961. Leon Uris&#x27;s work, based on real events, covers the Nazi occupation of Poland and the atrocities of systematically dehumanising and eliminating the Jewish people of Poland. The name &quot;Mila 18&quot; is taken from the headquarters bunker of Jewish resistance fighters underneath the building at &quot;ulica Miła 18&quot; (18 Mila Street, in English, 18 Pleasant Street). (See Miła 18.)
The term &quot;ghetto&quot; takes on a clearer meaning as the courageous Jewish leaders fight a losing battle against not only the Nazis and their henchmen, but also profiteers and collaborators among themselves. Eventually, as the ghetto is reduced to rubble, a few courageous individuals with few weapons and no outside help assume command of ghetto defence, form a makeshift army and make a stand.

==Summary==
As in many other books by Uris, the story is largely told from the standpoint of a newspaperman; in this case, an American-Italian journalist, Christopher de Monti, who is assigned to Warsaw after covering the Spanish Civil War. Although meant to be a dispassionate and neutral observer, he meets and becomes intimate with both the Nazi hierarchy and the Jews of Warsaw. He has a passionate affair with the wife of one of the Jewish community leaders, while also dealing with prostitutes provided by the Nazis.

As the ghetto is surrounded and reduced to rubble, he throws in his lot with the gallant defenders. He is one of the few survivors and manages to escape with a young woman, Gabriela Rak, who is pregnant with the child of one of the defenders, Andrei Androfski, a former Polish army officer.

===Characters===
*Andrei Androfski is a Polish army Ulany Brigade officer, and a Jew. He is hot-headed and several other characters comment that he is best at leading cavalry charges – i.e. hopelessly fighting until the end. He remains in the ghetto after the fall of the bunker at Mila 18 and is presumed dead afterwards.
*Gabriela Rak is Andrei Androfski&#x27;s girlfriend, although they decide not to marry due to Andrei&#x27;s Jewish descent. She worked at the American Embassy in Warsaw before the war and at the end of the book was carrying Andrei&#x27;s child.
*Christopher de Monti is a journalist whose father is Italian and mother is American. While opposed to fascism and being determined to bring out the truth to the world, he does not aid the fighters on the ghetto until he is compelled to enter the ghetto by the Nazi propaganda officer in Poland. He is the only person to know the location of all the ghetto&#x27;s diaries.
*Alexander Brandel is one of the leaders of the uprising and the father of Wolf Brandel. He started a diary, which was later expanded to 24 volumes by members of the ghetto. Loosely based on Emanuel Ringelblum.
*Wolf Brandel is the son of Alexander and one of the leaders of the uprising. He escapes the ghetto with a handful of survivors including his girlfriend Rachael Bronski. At the end of the book Christopher de Monti writes that Rachael and Wolf are off fighting in another Jewish resistance group.
*Rachael Bronski is the daughter of Paul and Deborah Bronski and the girlfriend of Wolf Brandel. Along with being a talented musician and an excellent soldier she assists Wolf with the command of his part of the army. When the uprising comes to an end Rachael and Wolf escape with a few others out of the sewers and to safety.
*Deborah Bronski is Christopher de Monti&#x27;s lover and the wife of Paul Bronski. She is also the sister of Andrei Androfski. While Deborah does not feel any love for Paul, especially after he opposes the resistance in the ghetto, she refuses to leave him until he dies. Deborah has two children – Rachael and Stephan Bronski.
*Paul Bronski is the husband of Deborah Bronski and, although a Jew, does not wish to be associated with other Jews in any way. He works at the Jewish Council and believes in cooperating with the Germans and opposing the Jewish resistance. He commits suicide eventually after not being able to cope with the pressure from both sides. Loosely based on Adam Czerniaków.
*Franz Koenig is an ethnic German living in Poland who receives higher and higher status after the Nazi invasion. As the war progresses, Koenig becomes more and more corrupted. He succeeds Paul Bronski in leading the Warsaw Medical Institute.

==Planned movie==

In August 2017, it was announced by film producer and Miramax co-founder Harvey Weinstein that he would produce a movie based on the novel, appointing himself as director. However, after the news of the producer&#x27;s sexual misconduct against several women, his future in the business was put into question.

<text>The Tramp (&quot;Charlot&quot; in several languages), also known as the Little Tramp, was English actor Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s most memorable on-screen character and an icon in world cinema during the era of silent film. &quot;The Tramp&quot; is also the title of a silent film starring Chaplin, which Chaplin wrote and directed in 1915.

The Tramp, as portrayed by Chaplin, is a childlike and bumbling but generally good-hearted character who is most famously portrayed as a mischievous vagrant. He endeavours to behave with the manners and dignity of a gentleman despite his actual social status. However, while the Tramp is ready to take what paying work is available, he also uses his cunning to get what he needs to survive and escape the authority figures who will not tolerate his antics.

Chaplin&#x27;s films did not always portray the Tramp as a vagrant, however. The character (&quot;The little fellow&quot;, as Chaplin called him) was rarely referred to by any names on-screen, although he was sometimes identified as &quot;Charlie&quot; and rarely, as in the original silent version of &quot;The Gold Rush&quot;, &quot;The little funny tramp&quot;.

==History==

The character of the Tramp was originally created by accident while Chaplin was working at Mack Sennett&#x27;s Keystone Studios, when dressing up for the 1914 short film &quot;Mabel&#x27;s Strange Predicament&quot; starring Mabel Normand and Chaplin. In a 1933 interview, Chaplin explained how he came up with the look of the Tramp:


That was actually the first film featuring the Tramp but a different film, shot later but with the same character, happened to be released two days earlier. The Tramp debuted to the public in the Keystone comedy &quot;Kid Auto Races at Venice&quot; (released on 7 February 1914; &quot;Mabel&#x27;s Strange Predicament&quot;, shot earlier, was released on 9 February 1914). Chaplin, with his Little Tramp character, quickly became the most popular star in Keystone director Mack Sennett&#x27;s company of players. Chaplin continued to play the Tramp through dozens of short films and, later, feature-length productions. (In only a handful of other productions did he play characters other than the Tramp.)

The Tramp was closely identified with the silent era, and was considered an international character. The 1931 sound production &quot;City Lights&quot; featured no dialogue. Chaplin officially retired the character in the film &quot;Modern Times&quot; (1936), which ended with the Tramp walking down a highway toward the horizon. The film was only a partial talkie and is often called the last silent film. The Tramp remains silent until near the end of the film when, for the first time, his voice is finally heard, albeit only as part of a French/Italian-derived gibberish song.

In &quot;The Great Dictator&quot;, Chaplin&#x27;s first film after &quot;Modern Times&quot;, Chaplin plays the dual role of a Hitler-esque dictator, and a Jewish barber. Although Chaplin emphatically stated that the barber was not the Tramp, he retains the Tramp&#x27;s moustache, hat, and general appearance. Despite a few silent scenes, including one where the barber is wearing the Tramp&#x27;s coat and bowler hat and carrying his cane, the barber speaks throughout the film (using Chaplin&#x27;s own English accent), including a passionate plea for peace that has been widely interpreted as Chaplin speaking as himself.

In 1959, having been editing &quot;The Chaplin Revue&quot;, Chaplin commented to a reporter regarding the Tramp character, &quot;I was wrong to kill him. There was room for the Little Man in the atomic age.&quot;

A vaudeville performer named Lew Bloom created a similar tramp character. Bloom argued he was &quot;the first stage tramp in the business&quot;. In an interview with the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; in 1957, Chaplin recalled being inspired by the tramp characters Weary Willie and Tired Tim, a long-running hobo comic strip from &quot;Illustrated Chips&quot; that he had read as a boy in London:

The wonderfully vulgar paper for boys [&quot;Illustrated Chips&quot;] ... and the &#x27;Adventures of Weary Willie and Tired Tim,&#x27; two famous tramps with the world against them. There&#x27;s been a lot said about how I evolved the little tramp character who made my name. Deep, psychological stuff has been written about how I meant him to be a symbol of all the class war, of the love-hate concept, the death-wish and what-all. But if you want the simple Chaplin truth behind the Chaplin legend, I started the little tramp simply to make people laugh and because those other old tramps, Weary Willie and Tired Tim, had always made me laugh.
== Characteristics ==
The personality of the Tramp in the early Keystone one-reelers is a pleasure-seeking anti-authoritarian and a flirt. The Tramp is also known for his mischievousness. The physical attributes of the Tramp include a pair of large baggy pants, a tight coat, a bowler hat, a large pair of shoes, a springy and flexible cane, and a toothbrush moustache—a mass of contradictions, as Chaplin wanted it to be.

Two films made in 1915, &quot;The Tramp&quot; and &quot;The Bank&quot;, created the characteristics of Chaplin&#x27;s screen persona. While in the end the Tramp manages to shake off his disappointment and resume his carefree ways, the pathos lies in the Tramp&#x27;s having hope for a more permanent transformation through love and his failure to achieve this.

The Tramp was usually the victim of circumstances and coincidences, but sometimes the results work in his favour. In &quot;Modern Times&quot;, he picks up a red flag that falls off a truck and starts to wave it at the truck in an attempt to return it, and by doing so, unknowingly and inadvertently becomes the leader of a group of protesting workers, and ends up in jail because of it. While in jail, he accidentally eats &quot;nose powder&quot; (i.e., cocaine), which causes him to not return to his jail cell; but when he eventually does, he fights off some jailbreakers attempting to escape, thus saving the life of the warden. Because of this, the warden offers to let him go, but the Tramp would rather stay in jail because it is better than the outside world.

==Significance==
Chaplin&#x27;s social commentary, while critical of the faults and excesses created by industrialisation, also shows support for and belief in the &quot;American Dream&quot;. In &quot;Modern Times&quot;, Chaplin creates a &quot;portrayal consistent with popular leftist stereotypes of wealthy business leaders and oppressed workers in the 1930s.&quot; While the Tramp and his fellow workers sweat on the assembly line, the president of the Electro Steel Company works on a puzzle and reads comic strips in the newspaper. The obsession of working with efficiency and assembly-line productivity ultimately drives the Tramp mad. This could be seen as &quot;an attack on the capitalist rationalization of production.&quot; However, &quot;the film also guardedly affirms American middle-class, particularly its optimism.&quot; For example, one sequence depicts the Tramp&#x27;s dream in which he and the gamine live a traditional middle-class lifestyle.

The Tramp and the gamine find a rundown shack to live in. The gamine cooks a cheap breakfast, and then the Tramp is off to work, while the gamine stays to maintain the home—an allusion to a middle-class setting. By the ending of &quot;Modern Times&quot;, &quot;the film seems tailored to please the middle-class optimist.&quot; Due to all of their failings the final scene had the gamine stating, &quot;What&#x27;s the use of trying?&quot;, and the Tramp replying &quot;Buck up—never say die.&quot; In his silent films, Chaplin uniquely deployed critical social commentary. &quot;What makes &quot;Modern Times&quot; decidedly different from Chaplin&#x27;s previous three films are the political references and social realism that keep intruding into Charlie&#x27;s world.&quot; &quot;No comedian before or after him has spent more energy depicting people in their working lives.&quot; &quot;Though there had been films depicting the lives of immigrants and urban workers, no filmmaker before Chaplin had created their experience so humanly and lovingly.&quot;

Chaplin used not one but two similar-looking characters to the Tramp in &quot;The Great Dictator&quot; (1940); however, this was an all-talking film (Chaplin&#x27;s first). The film was inspired by the noted similarity between Chaplin&#x27;s Tramp, most notably his small moustache and that of Adolf Hitler. Chaplin used this similarity to create a dark version of the Tramp character in parody of the dictator. In his book &quot;My Autobiography&quot;, Chaplin stated that he was unaware of the Holocaust when he made the film; if he had been, he writes, he would not have been able to make a comedy satirising Hitler. In his autobiography, Chaplin identifies the barber as the Tramp. A noticeable difference is that the barber has a streak of grey in his hair, whereas the Tramp had always been depicted as having dark hair. Also, the barber lacks the ill-fitting clothes of the Tramp and is clearly portrayed as having a profession. His character does share much of the Tramp&#x27;s character, notably his idealism and anger on seeing unfairness.

==List of films featuring the Tramp==

=== Keystone ===
Chaplin appeared in 36 films for Keystone Studios; 25 of them featured the Tramp character, all produced by Mack Sennett. Except where noted, all films were one reel in length.

=== Essanay ===
Chaplin wrote, directed, and starred in 15 films for the Essanay Film Manufacturing Company, 13 of them featuring the Tramp character, all produced by Jesse T. Robbins. Except where noted, all films are two-reelers.


=== Mutual ===
Chaplin wrote, produced, directed, and starred in 12 films for the Mutual Film Corporation, ten of which had Chaplin dressed as the character, while the remaining two were pseudo-Tramp films where he wore the mustache but dressed in different clothes. Mutual formed Lone Star Studios solely for Chaplin&#x27;s films. All of the Mutual releases are two reels in length. In 1932, Amadee J. Van Beuren of Van Beuren Studios purchased Chaplin&#x27;s Mutual comedies for $10,000 each, added music by Gene Rodemich and Winston Sharples and sound effects, and re-released them through RKO Radio Pictures.

=== First National ===
Chaplin wrote, produced, directed, and starred in nine films for his own production company between 1918 and 1923. In all but one of them Chaplin dressed as the character, the exception being &quot;The Pilgrim&quot;. These films were distributed by First National.

=== United Artists ===
Chaplin wrote, produced, directed, and/or starred in eight films for United Artists, though only four of them featured the Tramp character, five if &quot;The Great Dictator&quot; is included. Chaplin also wrote the musical scores, beginning with &quot;City Lights&quot;.


== Impersonations ==
In the 1910s, due to the desire for more Chaplin films than Chaplin could make, many created their own character like the Tramp or even just played the Tramp. This has continued, though to a much lesser degree, after the 1910s due to people admiring Chaplin. Some films have been animated and obviously do not need an actor to play the character, who is portrayed as mute.

Gloria Swanson (as Norma Desmond) did a burlesque of The Tramp in &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;. The most famous impersonation is that by Billy West.

==Legacy==
*At the peak of Chaplin&#x27;s popularity, in 1915, a song was made about him, titled &quot;Those Charlie Chaplin Feet&quot;, which describes his funny character, the Tramp.
*The Tramp character of Chaplin, according to Walt Disney, was one of the inspirations for the character of Mickey Mouse, saying &quot;We wanted something appealing, and we thought of a tiny bit of a mouse that would have something of the wistfulness of Chaplin ... a little fellow trying to do the best he could&quot;. Ub Iwerks, the artist who helped Disney designing Mickey, said about the character &quot;People accepted him as a symbolic character, and though he looked like a mouse, he was accepted as dashing and heroic.&quot;
*Numerous works cite the Tramp as an icon of the Great Depression, of Charlie Chaplin himself, and of the downtrodden hero, from Chaplin&#x27;s films with similar characters (such as &quot;The Great Dictator&quot;), to Playboy Penguin, the dapper, silent penguin rescued by Bugs Bunny.
*The Tramp made a cameo appearance in the 1974 Rankin/Bass stop motion holiday special &quot;The Year Without a Santa Claus&quot;.
*In 1978, a year after Chaplin&#x27;s death, the Peter, Sue, and Marc band took part in the German finals with their song &quot;Charlie Chaplin&quot; as their entry.
*In the 1980s, the character was portrayed in advertising for the IBM PC personal computer.
*The cartoon character &quot;Baggy Pants&quot; presents an imitation of the Tramp.
*From 1973 to 1990, the children&#x27;s educational television series &quot;Sesame Street&quot; occasionally featured cast member Sonia Manzano, who played Maria, in character as the Tramp for some skits. Manzano was often accompanied by fellow cast member Linda Bove, who would play a second Tramp or a supporting character, typically a pretty lady.
*Indian filmmaker-actor Raj Kapoor was inspired by Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;tramp&quot; character, adopting a similar &quot;tramp&quot; persona in a number of his films, such as &quot;Awaara&quot; (1951) and &quot;Shree 420&quot; (1955).
*In 2003, the &quot;AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Heroes &amp; Villains&quot; list ranked the Tramp as the 38th greatest hero.
*In 2006, &quot;Premiere&quot; issued its list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Performances of all Time&quot;, putting Chaplin&#x27;s performance as the Tramp in &quot;City Lights&quot; at No. 44.
*The Tramp is the main character in the CGI TV series &quot;Chaplin &amp; Co&quot;. The show places the character in the 21st century and features him meeting up with numerous characters (one of them being a modern version of the Kid) while retaining the humor from Chaplin&#x27;s original films.
*Homer Simpson dresses up as the Tramp in the opening couch gag in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; 2002 episode &quot;Jaws Wired Shut&quot;.
*The 1995 musical &quot;Little Tramp&quot; is based on the life of Chaplin and includes the creation of the Tramp.

<text>Frederick Andrew Seaton (December 11, 1909 – January 16, 1974) was an American newspaperman and politician. He represented the U.S. state of Nebraska in the U.S. Senate and served as U.S. Secretary of the Interior during Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s administration.

== Early life ==
Seaton was born in Washington, D.C., on December 11, 1909, the son of Dorothea Elizabeth (&quot;née&quot; Schmidt) and Fay Noble Seaton. He attended the Manhattan High School in Manhattan, Kansas. He graduated from Kansas State University in 1931, and married Gladys Hope Dowd (November 5, 1910 – January 5, 1999) in the same year. They had four children: Donald Richard, Alfred Noble, Johanna Christine, and Monica Margaret Seaton. In 1937, Seaton moved to Hastings, Nebraska, where he was for many years the publisher of the &quot;Hastings Tribune&quot;.

== Political career ==

Seaton was active in Republican politics. He served in the unicameral Nebraska Legislature from 1945 to 1949. He was appointed to the U.S. Senate on December 10, 1951, by Gov. Val Peterson to fill the vacancy created by the death of Kenneth S. Wherry. A Rockefeller Republican, Seaton was senator for less than a year; he had to vacate the post on November 4, 1952, when Dwight Griswold won the 1952 special election to complete the Senate term. He was the second of six Senators to serve during the fifteenth Senate term for Nebraska&#x27;s Class 2 seat, from January 3, 1949, to January 3, 1955.

Seaton served in various White House and subcabinet posts in Eisenhower&#x27;s administration, including Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs, before he was appointed as the U.S. Secretary of the Interior. He served in that office from June 8, 1956, until January 20, 1961. During his tenure, Alaska and Hawaii became the 49th and 50th states admitted to the Union. He was instrumental in the passing of the Alaska Statehood Act, appointing and recommending pro-Alaska politicians to high positions, such as Ted Stevens to Senior Counsel to the Secretary of Interior (later becoming Solicitor in 1960) and Mike Stepovich to Governor of the Territory of Alaska.

He ran for governor of Nebraska in 1962 but was defeated by the incumbent Democrat, Gov. Frank B. Morrison (Olson, p. 335). Following his defeat, Seaton became a strong advocate for campaign finance reform in Nebraska.

Seaton died in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on January 16, 1974, and is interred in Parkview Cemetery in Hastings, Nebraska.

<doc id="338296" wikidata="Q1267683" url="?curid=338296" title="Duke Wen of Eastern Zhou">
<text>Duke Wen of Eastern Zhou () (?–249 BC), personal name Jī Jié, reigned as King Hui of Zhou over the remaining rump state of the Zhou dynasty from 255 BC to 249 BC, when he was captured and executed by the army of Qin. Wen was the last member of the Zhou dynasty who claimed the throne of China, though he was never recognized as king outside his own small domain at Chengzhou. Forced to spend his entire reign fighting against the state of Qin, Wen&#x27;s death meant the final end of the Zhou dynasty.

== Biography ==
Jī Jié was born into the large royal Jī family that ruled China since 1046 BC, though by his time the dynasty had become effectively powerless. Their remaining crown land was embroiled in infighting and succession disputes, so that it was split into two factions, led by rival nobles: Western Zhou and Eastern Zhou. Jié, as Duke Wen, ruled over the East from Chengzhou, and largely ignored the authority of King Nan of Zhou who resided in Wangcheng and was supported by the western nobles. In 256 BC, however, war broke out between West Zhou under Nan and the state of Qin under King Zhaoxiang of Qin. Qin annexed the West, deposed King Nan and forcibly ended the Zhou dynasty. Many citizens and members of the royal family then fled to East Zhou, where they proclaimed Wen as the King of China (Son of Heaven) in 255 BC.

Allied with Ji Zhao, son of King Nan, Wen organized a resistance against Qin, and managed to preserve the last Zhou holdouts for six years. Ji Zhao&#x27;s forces were defeated in 251 BC, and two years later the army of Qin took Chengzhou. Wen was executed, and the city given to Lü Buwei for his services to King Zhuangxiang of Qin. The remaining Jī family members fled to the State of Wey.

<text>Constantine&#x27;s Sword: The Church and the Jews: A History (2001) is a book by James Carroll, a former priest, which documents the role of the Roman Catholic Church in the long European history of religious antisemitism as a precursor to racial antisemitism. The primary source of anti-Jewish violence is the perennial obsession with converting the Jews to Christianity; an event which some theologians believed would usher in the Second Coming.

==Description==
Carroll disclaims the notion that Christian anti-Judaism leads inevitably to the Holocaust committed by Nazi Germany, but he argues that Church&#x27;s long history of &quot;Jew-hatred&quot; laid the foundation for Hitler&#x27;s crimes. Carroll also points out the many &quot;turning points,&quot; as he labels them, where the Church&#x27;s attitudes and actions toward Jews could have been shifted. Just one example cited in the book is that of Pierre Abelard (1079–1142), the French theologian and philosopher, whose teachings, had they been accepted, would have radically changed the direction and cast of Christian dogma.

The book also analyzes, in detail, the actions of numerous popes and other prominent figures of Catholic Church history, especially those who advocated anti-Jewish policies and those who tried to rein in official antisemitism, including St. Augustine, Bernard of Clairvaux, Nicholas of Cusa, Innocent III, Paul IV, Pius IX, Pius XII, John XXIII, and John Paul II.

The book&#x27;s title refers to Constantine&#x27;s transformation of the cross, which Carroll claims, was not a symbol used by Christians in the first three centuries of the Church&#x27;s existence, into a symbolic sword infusing a spirit of violent intolerance into the development of Christianity. The claim by Carroll might be false as the first historic evidence for the cross being a symbol used by Christians and depicted in Christian art is dated to be end of second or beginning of third century, about 100 years before Constantine I. 
A documentary film based on the book was shown at film festivals in August 2007. Although exploring the same themes as the book, the documentary also focuses on events which occurred subsequent to the book&#x27;s publication, especially the controversy surrounding evangelical proselytizing at the United States Air Force Academy. The movie was directed by Oren Jacoby, who is also listed as a producer, and written by James Carroll and Oren Jacoby. It was released by the production company, Storyville Films.

<doc id="338298" wikidata="Q5674252" url="?curid=338298" title="Hart Stores">
<text>Hart Stores Inc. is a mid-sized value-driven department store in Eastern Canada. It was founded in 1960 by Harry Hart, in Rosemère, Quebec. Hart Stores is based in the provinces of Quebec, New Brunswick, and Ontario. The head office used to be in the Montreal borough of Anjou but moved to Laval, Quebec, a northern suburb of Montreal, in early 2006.

The company operates 128 stores across Canada, branded as &quot;Hart&quot;, primarily in smaller and suburban markets. Before running into financial difficulties in 2011, the chain had 92 stores under the Hart and Bargain Giant banners, extending as far east as Newfoundland.

The average store is approximately . The company positions itself within the market as a niche marketer. The target customer is low-to-average income consumers. Hart&#x27;s pricing strategy is to implement everyday low prices and a high/low strategy. The company does not emphasize a private label within their stores.

==Hartco==
The Hart clothing retail operation was one of several diverse retail and inside-sales businesses that operated under the Hart family umbrella. Computer retail and corporate IT services fell under their Hartco brands (managed independently from Hart Stores), included Metafore, Northwest Digital, CompuSmart, MicroAge and their original Compucentre chain of stores. The Telephone Booth/Cabine Téléphonique, a chain of stores that sells wired, cordless and cellular phones, was operated by Hartco until its purchase by Glentel.

During the annual shareholders meeting held on June 15, 2000, the shareholders approved a plan of arrangement to distribute its wholly owned subsidiaries of computer and IT services to the company&#x27;s common shareholders. The arrangement resulted in the formation of a separate publicly traded company operating under Hartco Inc. (). The department store division operated as Hart Stores and was listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

In fiscal 2006 the company reported net profits of $7.0 million.

==Bankruptcy reorganisation==
In August 2011, Hart Stores company had run into financial difficulties, and was granted bankruptcy protection under the Companies&#x27; Creditors Arrangement Act in Canadian law. The court appointed receiver was RSM Richter Inc., also in August 2011. the Company announced the return of Robert Farah as Chief Operating Officer.

In October 2011, Hart Stores announced the liquidation of 32 stores of the company&#x27;s 92 Canadian stores and appointed Tiger Capital Group LLC as the liquidator to conduct the liquidation sales at the 32 closing stores.

Hart filed its bankruptcy through the Quebec Superior Court (Commercial Division) in the District of Montreal. The court-appointed monitor of this case was granted to Richter Advisory Group Inc.

Eight of the former Newfoundland Bargain Giant locations were converted in 2012 to Rossy stores.

==Private acquisition==
In 2015, Hart Stores were bought by Mr. Paul Nassar who became the new President of the Company.

<text>Patrick O&#x27;Brien (1947 – July 16, 2014) was an American guitarist and lutenist born in New York. He was a recording artist, but was best known as a pedagogue in the field of early plucked instruments in America, and an expert in musicians&#x27; hand anatomy. He has worked with musicians on many instruments, reworking their technique around repetitive stress injuries and breakdowns of coordination.

==Biography==
Patrick O&#x27;Brien was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1947. He was an admirer and a student of many American folk and jazz musicians, in particular Reverend Gary Davis.

O&#x27;Brien taught early, classical, and other guitars, lute, archlute, theorbo and early harp in his native New York City for over fifty years. He was active as a continuo lutenist, guitarist, citternist and theorbist, and performed throughout Europe and North America with the Harp Consort, Baltimore Consort, Schola Antiqua, New York City Opera; and at the Caramoor, Spoleto and Boston Early Music festivals. He served on the faculties of the Mannes College of Music, the State and City Universities of New York and the annual Lute Society of America&#x27;s Seminar. He was a plucked instrument instructor for the Baroque program at Juilliard.

His students included, among others, Jozef van Wissem, Andrew Rutherford, Mara Galassi, and Roman Turovsky who in 2014 composed a tombeau on O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s death.

==Discography ==
Patrick O&#x27;Brien has made several recordings with the Harp Consort, The King&#x27;s Noyse and Paul O&#x27;Dette.

<doc id="338307" wikidata="Q7265382" url="?curid=338307" title="QB VII">
<text>QB VII by Leon Uris is a dramatic courtroom novel published in 1970. The four-part novel highlights the events leading to a libel trial in the United Kingdom. The novel was Uris&#x27;s second consecutive #1 &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller and third overall. The novel is loosely based on a court case for defamation (&quot;Dering v Uris&quot;) that arose from Uris&#x27;s earlier best-selling novel &quot;Exodus&quot;.

==Title==
&quot;QB VII&quot; is an abbreviation of Queen&#x27;s Bench Courtroom Number Seven.

==Plot==
A famous author, Abraham Cady, stands trial for libel. In his book &quot;The Holocaust&quot;, he named eminent surgeon Sir Adam Kelno as one of the Jadwiga concentration camp&#x27;s most sadistic inmates/doctors. Cady wrote the book after discovering the Jadwiga concentration camp was the site of his family&#x27;s extermination.

Kelno has denied his involvement in sadistic practices, and asserts he worked hard to save prisoners, at great personal risk. Furious at his depiction by Cady, Kelno brings libel charges against him. 

In the end, Kelno wins his case but is awarded one half-penny, the smallest coin of the realm, because his past actions were found to have been so bad that the minor inaccuracies in the book could not have damaged his reputation further.

The book was loosely based on a libel case involving the author and brought by Polish doctor Wladislaw Dering. Dering alleged that Uris had defamed him in his book &quot;Exodus&quot;.

== Reception ==
A review in &quot;TIME&quot; magazine called &quot;QB VII&quot; a &quot;vulgar affront&quot; and a &quot;rather gratuitous endurance test&quot;.

==Television miniseries==
The book was adapted into an Emmy-winning American television miniseries &quot;QB VII&quot; which aired on ABC on April 29 and 30, 1974.

<doc id="338314" wikidata="Q5175316" url="?curid=338314" title="Personal watercraft">
<text>A personal watercraft (PWC), also called Jet Ski or water scooter, is a primarily recreational watercraft that is designed to hold only a small number of occupants, who sit or stand on top of the craft, not within the craft as in a boat.

Prominent brands of PWCs include Jet Skis and Sea-Doos.

PWCs have two style categories. The first and the most popular is a compact runabout, typically holding no more than two or three people, who mainly sit on top of the watercraft as one does when riding an ATV or snowmobile. The second style is a &quot;stand-up&quot; type, typically built for only one occupant who operates the watercraft standing up as in riding a motorized scooter; it is used more for doing tricks, racing, and in competitions. Both styles have an inboard engine driving a pump-jet that has a screw-shaped impeller to create thrust for propulsion and steering. Most are designed for two or three people, though four-passenger models exist. Many of today&#x27;s models are built for more extended use and have the fuel capacity to make long cruises, in some cases even beyond .

Personal watercraft are often referred by the trademarked brand names of Kawasaki (Jet Ski), Yamaha (WaveRunner), Bombardier (Sea-Doo), Elaqua (E-PWC) and Honda (AquaTrax).

Personal watercraft boat conversion kits exist as Waveboats.

The United States Coast Guard defines a personal watercraft, amongst other criteria, as a jet-drive boat less than long. There are many larger &quot;jetboats&quot; not classed as PWCs, some more than long.

==History==
Water scooters—as they were originally termed—were first developed in the United Kingdom and Europe in the mid-1950s, with models such as the British 200cc propeller-driven Vincent &quot;Amanda&quot;, and the German &quot;Wave Roller&quot;. Two thousand Vincent Amandas were exported to Australia, Asia, Europe and the United States.

The Sea Skimmer was introduced in 1961 as a highly maneuverable version of a propelled surfboard. It was long, powered by an inboard/outboard motor and reached speeds up to . The rider lay on the boat, controlling the speed with hand throttles and using the feet as rudders. Originally manufactured in Kansas City, operations moved to Boynton, Florida, in 1962, and the name was changed to Aqua-Skimmer. Aqua-Skimmer ceased operations in 1962 and sold its inventory to the military. Renamed Aqua Dart (Aqua Dart INC), the Sea Skimmer, Aqua Skimmer, Aqua Dart was modified for military requirements, and saw service in 1962 river reconnaissance missions in Vietnam and other military missions until the 1970s.

In the 1960s, the idea was developed further by Clayton Jacobson II of Lake Havasu City, Arizona, USA. Originally a motocross enthusiast, Jacobson&#x27;s idea was designed in the mid-1960s, powered by an internal pump-jet rather than an outboard motor, made of all aluminum, and had a fixed, upright handle. Jacobson eventually quit his job in banking to devote himself to developing the idea, and had a working prototype by 1965. It differed slightly from modern personal watercraft but had definite similarities. He completed a second prototype a year later made of fiberglass.
The first Clayton-type PWC to reach the market was designed by Bombardier in the late 1960s. Bombardier&#x27;s original designs were not very popular and Bombardier left the business before 1970.

In Greece, an inventor named Dimitrios T. Moraitidis, built a prototype and submitted a patent to the government of the Kingdom of Greece on the 5th June 1970, with serial number 40056. He never exploited the invention commercially. He died on March 5, 2022.

Stand-up PWCs were first produced by the Japanese company Kawasaki (under the Jet Ski brand) in 1972, and appeared on the US market in 1973. These were mass-produced boats to be used by only one rider. While they are still produced today, the more popular design is the sit-down variety of PWC. These sit-down runabouts have been produced by Kawasaki (Jetski), Bombardier (Sea-Doo), Yamaha (WaveRunner), Honda (AquaTrax), Polaris (Sealion) and Arctic Cat (Tigershark). As of 2010, the major manufacturers of PWCs were Kawasaki, Bombardier and Yamaha. Both Yamaha and Kawasaki continue to sell stand-up models but it is a small percentage of the overall market.

Electric PWCs were commercialized in the early 2020s. Electric watercraft are increasing in popularity as gasoline engines produce greenhouse gases and can eject motor oil and gasoline directly into waterways.

== Sports ==

PWC racing competitions take place around the world. There are several disciplines: closed circuit speed races, offshore speed races (offshore), endurance races, freestyle (freestyle) and freeride events. For all these types of events, with the exception of freestyle, there are at least two categories: saddle jets and stand-up jets. For speed races, gear is generally classified according to the degree of authorized modifications: minor modifications fall into the so-called &quot;stock&quot; category, intermediate modifications into the so-called &quot;limited&quot; category, and more extensive modifications into the category. known as &quot;F1&quot;. In freestyle and freeride, these categories do not exist; rather, the competitors are classified according to the type of watercraft used (with stand-up or saddle).

The sport is ruled by the World Powerboating Federation (Union Internationale Motonautique, U.I.M.) recognised by the International Olympic Committee. The current official world series, established in 1996, is the Aquabike World Championship. The sport is also established at the national level and is ruled by each national federation&#x27;s member of the U.I.M. Aquabike World Championship is known among the motorsports with most different national entries for each competition, reaching up to 32 nationalities and 140 riders registered to compete in Italy in 2018.

Other private competitions also exist, such as P1 AquaX, which is a personal watercraft racing series, first launched in the UK in May 2011 by London-based sports promoter Powerboat P1. The series attracted a mix of new and current racers to a new type of racing and in 2013, P1 rolled out a second series in the USA. Such was the uptake that the original format needed revising to cope with the influx of new riders and by the end of 2015 over 400 riders from 11 countries had registered to compete in an AquaX event.

In the United States, the main sanctioning bodies are the International Jet Sport Boating Association (IJSBA) and Pro Watercross (PWX). As of 2022, the sport is experiencing exceeding levels of fragmentation and conflict due to poor management of the sanctioning bodies and non-constructive competition between organizations. The IJSBA World Finals competition is traditionally held in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, in early October. The Pro Watercross World Finals are typically held in Naples, Florida, in November.

== Non-recreational uses ==

PWCs are small, fast, easily handled, fairly easy to use, and affordable, and their propulsion systems do not have external propellers, making them in some respects safer than small motorboats for swimmers and wildlife. For these reasons, they are used for fishing, one of the PWC industry&#x27;s fastest-growing segments.

Lifeguards use PWCs equipped with rescue platforms to rescue water users from trouble, as well as flood survivors, and carry them to safety. Police and rangers use them to enforce laws in coastal waters, lakes and rivers. A PWC combined with a wash-reduction system, carrying waterproof loudspeaker equipment and GPS for instructions and distance measurement, has reportedly been used by assistant coaches for rowing sports on the River Tyne.

Further, PWCs are used by the U.S. Navy as surface targets. When equipped with GPS, electronic compass, radar reflector, and a radio modem, the PWC can be controlled remotely with a two-way link. Its small shipboard footprint allows it to be stored in and deployed from the smallest of vessels, and it has been used for target practice for armaments of sizes from cannon to small arms.

==Hazards==

Apart from the obvious hazards of collisions and mechanical breakdowns common to all vehicles, operating or riding a PWC can involve a risk of orifice injuries. These injuries are typical of the kinds of injuries that waterskiers experience as a result of falling into the water at speed. Such injuries can occur from simply falling in the water at speed or they can occur from the output end of the pump jet. A rider who falls (or is ejected) off the back can land directly in the path of the PWC&#x27;s high-pressure jet of water. Unless a rider is appropriately dressed in garments made out of a strong, thick substance like neoprene (as is commonly found in wetsuits), the jet may penetrate any orifice it reaches. All major PWC manufacturers warn about this risk and recommend that passengers wear wet suit bottoms or equivalent protection. The American Waterski Racing Association recommends that all of their racers wear wet suit bottoms for this same reason.

Such orifice injuries can result in permanent disability or death. For example, in 2006, the California Court of Appeal for the First Appellate District upheld a $3.7 million Napa County jury verdict against Polaris Industries arising out of one such incident (which had devastating effects on the victim&#x27;s lower abdomen). 
It is also possible for multiple riders on the same PWC to sustain orifice injuries in a single accident, as actually occurred in a 2007 accident at Mission Bay which resulted in a San Diego County jury verdict affirmed in full on appeal in 2014.

Another noteworthy risk of injury is known as off throttle steering, which results from the lack of steering capability while off throttle in certain models of PWCs. This can result in death or serious bodily injuries.

While also rare, spinal injuries can occur while surf jumping and, potentially, wake jumping. The PWC manufacturers&#x27; owner&#x27;s manuals all include warnings regarding jumping at excessive heights, or operating a PWC if there is a prior history of back injury. The current on-product labels say &quot;Jumping wakes or waves can increase the risk of spinal/backbone injuries (paralysis)&quot;. The current Kawasaki owner&#x27;s manual provides: &quot;Slow down before crossing waves. Do not ride if you have a back condition. High speed operation in choppy or rough water may cause back injuries.&quot;

Another rare, but unique injury risk with jetboats, is being sucked into the intake side of the pump jet. Current PWC products contain on-product warnings that state: &quot;&quot;Keep away from Intake Grate&quot; while the engine is on. Items such as long hair, loose clothing, or PFD straps can become entangled in moving parts and result in severe injury or drowning&quot;.

There have been fatal accidents involving PWCs. In a notable case, U.S. astronaut Alan G. Poindexter died in 2012 from injuries sustained in a Jet Ski accident in Florida.

<doc id="338315" wikidata="Q7990502" url="?curid=338315" title="Whale Island, Hampshire">
<text>Whale Island is a small island in Portsmouth Harbour, close by Portsea Island. It is home to HMS &quot;Excellent&quot;, the oldest shore training establishment within the Royal Navy, and the location of the Navy Command Headquarters. The island is linked to Portsea Island and thence to the mainland by road bridges.

==Early history==
Ordnance Survey maps of Portsmouth Harbour from 1862 show Whale Island as a narrow strip: its east-to-west dimensions were similar to present times, but north to south it measured only tens of yards. To its northwest was Little Whale Island. Modern Whale Island is predominantly reclaimed land, using the deposits dredged from Portsmouth harbour during the 19th century, increasing the land area by about 125%. It was constructed with the help of the many prisoners taken in the Napoleonic Wars.

==Expansion==
During 1867 a viaduct was constructed from the north wall of the dockyard to the south-east corner of Big Whale Island which allowed spoil to be moved from dredging the docks (part of the expansion of HMNB Portsmouth), reclaiming the land between Big Whale Island and Little Whale Island, forming the basis of the island as it is today.

The railway which ran on the viaduct was extended around the island to help with the distribution of the spoil and much of the track is still present today, buried under the roads. Manual construction work was mostly undertaken by convicts; a favourable assignment because of the extra food.

By 1885 the island had five rifle ranges, but three of these were soon decommissioned to make room for the Gun Drill Battery and Drill Ground (today this is the Summer Parade Ground).

Photos on display in Whale Island Quarterdeck (constructed 1888) show that a footbridge to Stamshaw, Portsea Island, was added sometime before 1898 (incorporating a swing-bridge). A small road-bridge now joins the islands at the same point.

From September 1916, the island was home to the Anti-Aircraft Experimental Section.

Before World War II Whale Island was home to a zoo which gave a home to several animals presented to British representatives by friendly countries.

==Ceremony==
The gun carriage that carries the coffin in British state funerals is maintained on Whale Island.

==Visiting==
HMS &quot;Excellent&quot; is an active naval base so it is not open to the general public, but there are occasional open days and prospective visitors are advised to contact the base.

<text>Jet Ski is the brand name of a personal watercraft (PWC) manufactured by Kawasaki, a Japanese company. The term is often used generically to refer to any type of personal watercraft used mainly for recreation, and it is also used as a verb to describe the use of any type of PWC.

A runabout-style PWC typically carries one to three people seated in a configuration like a typical bicycle or motorcycle.

==Kawasaki Jet Ski ==
&quot;Jet Ski&quot; is a proper noun and registered trademark of Kawasaki. Released in 1972, the stand-up Kawasaki Jet Ski was the first commercially successful personal watercraft in America (after reaching a license agreement with the inventor of the Sea-Doo, Clayton Jacobson II when his license agreement with Bombardier expired). The Kawasaki Jet Ski was the only commercially successful PWC for almost 16 years, from the introduction of the WSAA in October 1972 through the reintroduction of the sit-down, runabout-style Bombardier Sea-Doo in 1988.
With the introduction of the Jet Ski, Kawasaki helped create the United States Jet Ski Boating Association (USJSBA), in cooperation with aftermarket companies and enthusiasts. In 1982 the name was changed to the International Jet Sports Boating Association (IJSBA). At the start, only JS440 stand-ups were raced. After Kawasaki introduced the runabout-style X2 in 1986, it gained its own class, later to be renamed the &quot;Sport Class&quot;.

==Stand-up model history==
===1972–1976===
Kawasaki introduced the first production stand-up PWC in October 1972. The WSAA and follow-on WSAB were powered by modified 400cc 2-stroke twin-cylinder engines. The WSAA was designed with a flat hull and the WSAB came with a convex v-hull design. The design concept distinctive of these original craft included a fully enclosed impeller for safety, self-righting, and self-circling features. Without a lanyard the self-circling allowed the rider to swim back to the idling craft after falling off. Kawasaki called them &quot;Water Jet&quot; and &quot;Power Skis&quot; before they settled on the name &quot;Jet Ski&quot;.

===1976–1982===
The 1976 JS400 was popular among thrill-seeking recreational riders and racers. The 1977 JS440 offered more power and performance. It was one of Kawasaki&#x27;s longest-selling models. In 1982, Kawasaki introduced the JS550, which had better performance. The 550 featured a newly designed high-capacity mixed-flow pump, driven by a 531cc engine. The 550 introduced an automatic rev limiter to prevent engine damage when the pump cavitates. The JS550 also introduced underwater exhaust for quieter operation.

===1982–1986===
While the JS550 continued to be improved, in 1986, Kawasaki introduced the JS300. The JS300 was a single-cylinder 294cc two-stroke engine featuring automatic oil injection. They also added the 650 X2, their first sit-down Jet Ski, and originator of the Sport Class for PWC racing.

===1987–1992===
Kawasaki introduced the JS650SX. It featured a higher capacity axial flow pump and a powerful 635cc two-stroke twin engine in a modified V-hull design for increased maneuverability and stability.

In 1992, the company introduced a stand-up JS750-A. The engine was a twin-cylinder 743 cc two-stroke with reed valves and automatic oil injection. The redesigned hull was lighter in weight and more maneuverable.

===1995===
The 750 SXI (JS750-B) was introduced and became the first stand-up Jet Ski with dual carburetors.

===2003===
Kawasaki introduced the SX-R 800 (JS800A), which increased displacement to 781cc, in the form of an in-line twin 2-stroke engine, generating 80hp. The SX-R also moved to a fiberglass-reinforced plastic (FRP) hull and top deck.

===2006===
Kawasaki introduced the X2 800 (JF800A), which used the JS800A engine, jet unit and lower hull.
This was released as an updated version similar to the 650cc X2 previously released in the 1980s.
===2011===
Due to US EPA restrictions, Kawasaki released their final two-stroke stand-up, and discontinued the JS800 SX-R. The model was designated the JS800ABF.

===2017===
On October 6, 2016, Kawasaki reintroduced the stand-up Jet Ski. The SX-R 1500 shared little with its predecessors. It was , , powered by a inline 4-cylinder four-stroke engine.

==Jet ski==
Kawasaki produced various models of the Jet Ski starting in 1972, beginning with the JS400 and leading up to the current JS1500.

<text>Polaris Inc. is an American automotive manufacturer headquartered in Medina, Minnesota, United States. Polaris was founded in Roseau, Minnesota, where it still has engineering and manufacturing facilities. The company manufactured motorcycles through its Victory Motorcycles subsidiary until January 2017, and currently produces motorcycles through the Indian Motorcycle subsidiary, which it purchased in April 2011. Polaris produced personal watercraft from 1994 to 2004. The company was originally named Polaris Industries Inc. and was renamed in 2019 to Polaris Inc.

Robin (a subsidiary of Subaru Corporation) previously developed and supplied all-terrain vehicle (ATV) and snowmobile engines for Polaris Inc. Starting in 1995 with the Polaris Magnum 425 4-stroke ATV and in 1997, with the introduction of the &quot;twin 700&quot; snowmobile engine Polaris started the development and production in house of the &quot;Liberty&quot; line of engines, now found in many models across their current production lines. Since that time Polaris has continued to develop their in-house engine production capacity, now designing and manufacturing all of their own power plants, while maintaining the partnership with Subaru.

In 2010, Polaris relocated a portion of its utility and sport vehicle assembly to Mexico. Components are manufactured in Osceola, Wisconsin and the vehicle assembly is done in Roseau, Minnesota. The vast majority of powertrain and vehicles for the off-road line are manufactured in the Osceola and Roseau facilities, respectively. Both the Victory and Indian motorcycle brands are American made with complete powertrains and vehicle assembly located in Osceola, Wisconsin, and Spirit Lake, Iowa, respectively.

==History==
Edgar Hetteen (later described by the Snowmobile Hall of Fame in St. Germain, Wisconsin as the father of the snowmobile), David Johnson, and Edgar&#x27;s brother Allan Hetteen were partners in Hetteen Hoist and Derrick in Roseau, Minnesota. Edgar had dropped out of school after the eighth grade in 1934. David Johnson and company employees Paul Knochenmus and Orlen Johnson, who was the first person to ride a Polaris, decided to create a vehicle that could travel through snow. These vehicles&#x27; primary use was to make hunting locations more accessible. David Johnson and several employees created the prototype in 1954 while Edgar was on a business trip. Edgar returned to Roseau to discover the snow machine and was furious the employees had used their time and company resources on the machine. This first machine used a grain silo conveyor belt as a track, a Briggs and Stratton motor, and an old Chevy bumper for skis. Edgar was skeptical of its value, and the No. 1 sled was soon sold to Roseau lumberyard owner &quot;Silver Pete&quot; H.F. Peterson for $465 in order to meet company payroll.

However, the employees continued to focus on building snowmobiles and soon a second model was created, with Allan Hetteen leading the way; it was called the Polaris Sno Traveler. The first production model rolled off the assembly line in Minnesota in 1956. The original models weighed close to and moved at a speed of about . As Polaris snowmobiles gained sales traction, Edgar Hetteen became an advocate of the new product line. In order to promote the new snowmobile and prove its reliability and usefulness, in 1960 Edgar led a three-snowmobile, 1,200-mile trek across the Alaskan wilderness, starting from Bethel, Alaska. The trip took three weeks, and much of the time, Edgar struggled to maintain 10 mph over the snow. The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner put them on its front page. However, Edgar&#x27;s absence caused problems for him with the Roseau bank&#x27;s board of directors. Soon after completing the trip, Edgar left the company in June and started a competing company called Polar Manufacturing in Thief River Falls, Minnesota. The company name later changed to Arctic Enterprises; in the mid-1980s it filed for bankruptcy amid declining industry snowmobile sales with a recession and overproduction in a poor winter which continued the demise of many manufacturers. The company emerged from bankruptcy and continues on today as Arctic Cat.

Polaris began developing a smaller consumer-sized, front-engine snowmobile to compete with the Ski-Doo in the early 1960s. In 1964, Polaris released the Comet. However, the Comet soon ran into problems as it could not travel in all types of snow conditions. Polaris then recalled the sleds and quickly developed a new prototype to avoid bankruptcy. The new model, the 1965 Mustang, became a hit as a family snowmobile and boosted Polaris sales. Polaris continued to develop snowmobiles similar to this model throughout the 1960s-1970s, and went on to become one of the leaders in the snowmobile industry.

In the early 1980s, Polaris started creating an Indy style snowmobile with IFS and a wider stance. They continued with the Indy style sled in the 90s with the Storm, XLT, XCR, Ultra, RMK, and Trail lines, within the last few years Polaris has re-introduced the INDY model name. In 1985, Polaris introduced the Scrambler ATC and Trail Boss, which are considered to be the first American-made production all-terrain vehicles (ATV). In the early 1990s, Polaris introduced the Polaris Rocky Mountain King (RMK)- a snowmobile specific for mountain terrain. In May 2009, Polaris announced the creation of an On-Road Vehicle Division. The new division will be devoted to the growth of Victory motorcycles and other on-road products and brands. In 2010, Polaris introduced the Polaris Rush snowmobile which had a new suspension system and better trail handling capabilities. This snowmobile is also available with retro graphics on the Rush and Iq models. In late 2005, Polaris announced that it would purchase a portion of KTM Motorcycles. Through this venture KTM has developed their own ATV and Polaris has developed Sport ATVs which utilize the KTM 525 and 450 powerplants.

On May 21, 2010, Polaris announced that it was opening a new manufacturing plant in Mexico. The sister facility in Osceola, Wisconsin still remains in full operation. The opening of the Monterrey, Mexico facility is anticipated to save the company $30 million annually, with most of that savings coming from lower wages. The Monterrey facility has 3 assembly lines devoted to production of Ranger side-by-sides for global markets. The original intent of the Monterrey facility was to serve markets in the Southern US plus Mexico and North America.

In October 2011, Polaris announced an investment in Brammo, Inc., an electric vehicle company based in Ashland, Oregon, United States. Its first production electric motorcycle, the Brammo Enertia, is assembled in Ashland and sold at dealerships. Polaris continued its investment in Brammo when it participated in the $13 million opening tranche of Brammo&#x27;s Series C funding round in July 2012. Polaris had been showing interest in electric propulsion, producing an electric version of its Ranger Side-by-Side and more recently buying Global Electric Motorcars (GEM). As one publication put it, &quot;This latest move likely signals the addition of clean and quiet drivetrains to ATVs and motorcycles under the global giant&#x27;s brand umbrella – snowmobiles may have to wait on battery breakthroughs before they become commercially feasible.&quot; On January 15, 2015, Polaris announced that it had purchased the entire electric motorcycle business from Brammo. Production of electric motorcycles was slated to commence at Polaris&#x27; factory in Spirit Lake, Iowa during the second half of 2015. Polaris also manufactures Victory and Indian motorcycles at the Spirit Lake factory.

In 2012, production restarted on the Indy-named sleds (stopped in 2004 with the Indy 500) with the release of the 2013 Indy 600 and Indy 600 SP. For 2014, Polaris will expand the Indy name and provide model variants for nearly all categories (the one exception being the &quot;Mountain&quot; class).

On April 11, 2013, Polaris announced that it acquired Aixam-Mega, a French quadricycle manufacturer.

On January 9, 2015, Polaris announced it will be opening a new 600,000-square-foot facility in Huntsville, Alabama that will employ at least 1,700 workers. Construction on the new manufacturing plant is set to start in early 2015 and should be opened by the spring of 2016. The plant will support several core processes including, vehicle assembly, chassis and body painting, welding, fabrication and injection molding.

On March 7, 2016, Polaris acquired Taylor-Dunn, a manufacturer of industrial vehicles based in Anaheim, CA.

On January 9, 2017, Polaris Chairman and CEO Scott Wine announced they would be shutting down Victory Motorcycles. They announced they will continue to honor warranties and produce parts for Victory Motorcycles for the next 10 years.

In April 2018, Polaris Industries agreed to pay a record $27.25 million civil penalty for failing to report defective off-road vehicles.

In May 2018, Polaris reentered the production of boats by purchasing the Indiana-based Boat Holdings LLC for $805 million. The company invested further in its boating division in January 2019 with the acquisition of Marquis-Larson Boat Group out of Pulaski, Wisconsin. Production of Marquis-Larson moved to a facility in Syracuse, Indiana. They then went on to make the Polaris Slingshot, a three-wheeler.

On July 29, 2019, the company changed its name from Polaris Industries Inc. to Polaris Inc. and commenced trading with the new name on August 8, 2019.

On July 20, 2023, Polaris bought Walker Evans Racing.

In 2023, the company launched the all-electric Ranger XP Kinetic (electric motor and electric transmission). In 2022, Godfrey&#x27;s Mighty G Pontoon was launched, compatible with either electric or gas propulsion, with consumers favoring electric rigs.

Polaris Inc. has been recognised by Ethisphere as one of the 2023 World&#x27;s Most Ethical Companies. The 2023 award has 135 recipients representing 19 countries and 46 industries. In 2024, the company also made the Ethisphere list (36 recipients, 20 countries, 44 industries). To qualify for the World&#x27;s Most Ethical Companies, an applicant must provide more than 240 different pieces of evidence of the company&#x27;s culture, from environmental and social management practices to compliance with inclusion requirements.

==Polaris Government and Defense==

Polaris Government and Defense (formerly Polaris Defense) is a division of Polaris Industries founded in 2005 and re-branded in 2017. The division was created after years of successful implementation of the company&#x27;s off-road vehicles in military theater. The division produces a range of vehicles to serve the United States and allied forces. Products include the MRZR platform, MVRS, MV700, RZR-SW and the DAGOR.

===MRZR===
In November 2016, the U.S. Marine Corps signed a $6.5 million contract with Polaris to deliver 145 MRZR-D ATVs. Called the Utility Task Vehicle (UTV), it is a version of the vehicle already in use by U.S. Special Operations Command, but is designed to be diesel-powered and can run on JP-8 fuel. The Marines bought the unarmored ATVs because they can fit inside an MV-22 Osprey, enabling them to be deployed from long distances, to provide logistics support to ground combat units, assisting them to travel and transport supplies quicker and easier than previously on foot. The vehicles can carry four troops and have a small cargo bed capable of carrying of payload. It is planned to field 18 MRZR-Ds per infantry regiment. The vehicles are to be delivered from late-January to April 2017.

===DAGOR===
DAGOR (Deployable Advanced Ground Off-road) is a purpose-built military off-road vehicle that is designed for rapid external and internal air transportability and that incorporates commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components and driveline system with spares available worldwide. The DAGOR was developed under contract from elements of the United States Special Operations Command and international Special Operations Forces (SOF). The vehicle was designed in partnership with Roush Industries over two years who are also responsible for production. The DAGOR was unveiled at the 2014 Association of the United States Army Annual Meeting in October 2014. The DAGOR can accommodate up to nine soldiers: four in the cabin, four in the bed, and a roof gunner who has a seat suspended from the roll cage in the cabin.

The vehicle can be configured in up to 48 different weapon configurations using the weapons ring and multiple pintle mounts. The vehicle is powered by a light weight, commercial off-the-shelf turbo diesel / JP8 engine. The vehicle can transport a maximum payload of more than 1,400 kg. It has high mobility with high speeds over rough terrain. The vehicle is certified for air drop and internal air transport by CH-47 Chinook heavy-lift helicopter, and sling load under UH-60 Black Hawk utility helicopters. The vehicle supports low velocity air drop (LVAD) method.

In March 2018, Polaris unveiled the DAGOR A1, which can carry 20% more payload than the original DAGOR, and also has increased ride height.

<text>Colonization is a trilogy of alternate history books by American writer Harry Turtledove. It is a series continuation of the situation set up in the &quot;Worldwar&quot; tetralogy, projecting the situation between humanity and The Race (the bipedal lizard-like invaders and settlers from &quot;Worldwar&quot;) nearly twenty years afterward, in the mid-1960s.

The Race has settled and plans to colonize nearly half the surface of the Earth, including Africa, Australia, China, southern Asia, Mexico, Central America, South America, Spain, Portugal, and Poland (prewar Poland and East Prussia). The United States, Canada, the Soviet Union, the Greater German Reich (Germany and the territories that it occupied during World War II), the United Kingdom, and Japan are the only other powers when the Race&#x27;s colonization fleet of 80–100 million settlers arrives. Humanity and The Race still jockey for advantages over each other.

==Novels==
Books of the Colonization trilogy are:

* &quot;&quot; (1999)
* &quot;&quot; (2000)
* &quot;&quot; (2001)

A follow-up novel to this series, &quot;Homeward Bound&quot;, was released in 2004.

==Political situation==
The Race has taken over half of the planet. With the exception of the Greater German Reich, the Soviet Union, the Japanese Empire, the British Isles, the US, and some nations that are allied to the major powers, mostly in the Northern Hemisphere, the Race rules most of the Earth. The Race spends its time trying to adapt to conditions on Earth (for example, the aliens release species from Home on Earth, causing environmental trouble). The Soviet Union supplies weapons to Mao Zedong&#x27;s Communist Party. The Greater German Reich attacks Race-held Poland and fails, resulting in the death of Führer Ernst Kaltenbrunner, his top officials, the nuclear destruction of much of Greater Germany, the removal of Nazi space installations, the German capital being relocated to Flensburg, and Walter Dornberger becoming the new Führer. France regains its independence under a new Fourth Republic. The United States is led by President Earl Warren. The Soviet Union is ruled by ex-Foreign Commissar Vyacheslav Molotov.

==Technology==
The Race&#x27;s initial invasion has benefited the technology of humanity. With the end to the second round of fighting, alien technology is being rapidly absorbed by humanity. Although the Race remains superior in technology, it is swiftly losing ground as human technology advances.

By the end of &quot;Colonization: Aftershocks&quot;, the United States and the Greater German Reich already have spacecraft floating among the asteroid belt. The Americans have also launched two human starships. The Soviet Union, the United States, and the Greater German Reich have established a Moon base, and Germany then the US put a man on Mars.

==Literary criticism and reception==
A writer from the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; called the &quot;Colonization series&quot; one of the best of Turtledove&#x27;s works.

<doc id="338327" wikidata="Q831359" url="?curid=338327" title="Positive liberty">
<text>Positive liberty is the possession of the power and resources to act in the context of the structural limitations of the broader society which impacts a person&#x27;s ability to act, as opposed to negative liberty, which is freedom from external restraint on one&#x27;s actions.

The concepts of structure and agency are central to the concept of positive liberty because in order to be free, a person should be free from inhibitions of the social structure in carrying out their ambitions. Structurally, classism, sexism, ageism, ableism and racism can inhibit a person&#x27;s freedom. As positive liberty is primarily concerned with the possession of sociological agency, it is enhanced by the ability of citizens to participate in government and have their voices, interests, and concerns recognized and acted upon.

Isaiah Berlin&#x27;s essay &quot;Two Concepts of Liberty&quot; (1958) is typically acknowledged as the first to explicitly draw the distinction between positive and negative liberty.

== Overview ==
Charles Taylor works to resolve one of the issues that separate &#x27;positive&#x27; and &#x27;negative&#x27; theories of freedom, as these have been distinguished in Isaiah Berlin&#x27;s seminal essay, &quot;Two concepts of liberty&quot;. He sees it as undeniable that there are two such families of conceptions of political freedom.

Thus, Taylor clarifies that there are two competing theories. One aims to define freedom exclusively in terms of the independence of the individual from interference by others, be these governments, corporations, or private persons; this theory is challenged by those who believe that freedom resides at least in part in collective control over the common life.

Negative liberty is a concept that is often used in political philosophy. It is the idea that freedom means being able to do what you want, without any external obstacles. This concept has been criticized for being too simplistic and not taking into account the importance of individual self-realization.

Taylor suggests that negative liberty is little more than a philosophical term and that real liberty is achieved when significant social and economic inequalities are also considered. He proposed dialectical positive liberty as a means to gaining both negative and positive liberty, by overcoming the inequalities that divide us.

Further, Taylor argues that the Hobbes–Bentham view is indefensible as a view of freedom. Faced with this two-step process, it seems safer and easier to stop it at the first step, to insist firmly that freedom is just a matter of the absence of external obstacles, that it, therefore, involves no discrimination of motivation and permits in principle no second-guessing of the subject by anyone else. This is the essence of the Maginot Line strategy, and it is very tempting; (here, Taylor is referring to ways in which one can &quot;fortify&quot; an argument). But, he claims this is wrong; we cannot defend a view of freedom that does not involve at least some qualitative discrimination as to motive, that is, which does not put some restrictions on motivation among the necessary conditions for freedom, and hence which could rule out second-guessing in principle.

Therefore, Taylor argues for a distinction between negative and positive liberty that highlights the importance of social justice.

== History ==
Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s theory of freedom, according to which individual freedom is achieved through participation in the process whereby one&#x27;s community exercises collective control over its own affairs in accordance with the &quot;general will&quot;. He wrote: &quot;The mere impulse to appetite is slavery, while obedience to law &quot;we prescribe ourselves&quot; is liberty.&quot; For him, the passage from the state of nature to the civil state substitutes justice for instinct gives his actions the morality they had formerly lacked.

G.W.F Hegel wrote in his &quot;Elements of the Philosophy of Right&quot; (in the part in which he introduced the concept of the sphere of abstract right) that &quot;duty is not a restriction on freedom, but only on freedom in the abstract&quot; and that &quot;duty is the attainment of our essence, the winning of positive freedom&quot;.

== Examples ==
In the description of positive liberty from the &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot;,

In &quot;Recovering the Social Contract&quot;, Ron Replogle made a metaphor that is helpful in understanding positive liberty. &quot;Surely, it is no assault on my dignity as a person if you take my car keys, against my will, when I have had too much to drink. There is nothing paradoxical about making an agreement beforehand providing for paternalistic supervision in circumstances when our competence is open to doubt.&quot; In this sense, positive liberty is the adherence to a set of rules agreed upon by all parties involved, all of whom must agree to any alterations to the rules. Therefore, positive liberty is a contractarian philosophy.

Isaiah Berlin opposed any suggestion that paternalism and positive liberty could be equivalent. He stated that positive liberty could only apply when the withdrawal of liberty from a person was in pursuit of a choice that he or she made, not a general principle of society or any other person&#x27;s opinion. In the case where a person removes a driver&#x27;s car keys against their will because they have had too much to drink, this constitutes positive freedom only if the driver has made, of their own free will, an earlier decision not to drive drunk. Thus, by removing the keys, the other person facilitates this decision and ensures that it will be upheld in the face of paradoxical behaviour (i.e., drinking) by the driver. For the remover to remove the keys in the absence of such an expressed intent by the driver, because the &quot;remover&quot; feels that the driver &quot;ought not to&quot; drive drunk, is paternalism, and not positive freedom by Berlin&#x27;s definition.

Erich Fromm sees the distinction between the two types of freedom emerging alongside humanity&#x27;s evolution away from the instinctual activity that characterizes lower animal forms. This aspect of freedom, he argues, &quot;is here used not in its positive sense of &#x27;freedom to&#x27; but in its negative sense of &#x27;freedom from&#x27;, namely freedom from instinctual determination of his actions.&quot; For Fromm, freedom from animal instinct implicitly implies that survival now hinges on the necessity of charting one&#x27;s own course. He relates this distinction to the biblical story of man&#x27;s expulsion from Eden:

Positive freedom, Fromm maintains, comes through the actualization of individuality in balance with the separation from the whole: a &quot;solidarity with all men&quot;, united not by instinctual or predetermined ties, but on the basis of a freedom founded on reason.

<doc id="338330" wikidata="Q936263" url="?curid=338330" title="Gosport">
<text>Gosport ( ) is a town and non-metropolitan district with borough status in Hampshire, England. At the 2021 Census, the town had a population of 70,131 and the district had a population of 81,952. Gosport is situated on a peninsula on the western side of Portsmouth Harbour, opposite the city of Portsmouth, to which it is linked by the Gosport Ferry. 

Until the last quarter of the 20th century, Gosport was a major naval town associated with the defence and supply infrastructure of His Majesty&#x27;s Naval Base (HMNB) Portsmouth. As such over the years extensive fortifications were created. Gosport is still home to and a Naval Armament Supply Facility, as well as a helicopter repair base. 

As part of the &quot;Renaissance of Portsmouth Harbour&quot; Millennium project, a large sundial, known as the Millennium Timespace, was installed on the harbour front in 2000. Alongside this sundial, a long meandering path of designed paving stones can be found, known as the Millennium Path; this can also be seen across the Solent in Portsmouth.

==Name==
Though there are multiple theories which point towards the etymology of Gosport, it is widely purported to derive its name from &quot;goose&quot;. An alternative etymology of &quot;gorse&quot; (from the bushes growing on local heathland) is not supported by the regional name for the plant, &quot;furze&quot;. A third theory, claiming a derivation from &quot;God&#x27;s Port&quot; is believed to be a 19th-century invention. This is, however, the slogan of Gosport as demonstrated on its emblem.

==Geography==
The Town area of the Borough, including Newtown, consists of the High Street, Stoke Road shopping area, Walpole Park, Royal Clarence Yard and three modern marinas: Royal Clarence, Gosport Marina and Haslar Marina.

South of the centre is Haslar Creek, which flows into Portsmouth Harbour near the harbour mouth. The lowest part of Haslar Creek is called Haslar Lake; at its western end, the creek splits into two branches. These are called Workhouse Lake (the northern branch) and Stoke Lake (the southern branch). South East of Stoke Lake and along Gilkicker Point is the area of Clayhall.

West, Northwest and South of Stoke Lake is the district and village of Alverstoke. To the west of which is Browndown, where the River Alver flows into The Solent at Stokes Bay. Further west from Browndown point is the district of Lee-on-the-Solent with the former RNAS &quot;Daedalus&quot; which is now home to a hovercraft museum and several marine related businesses, and CEMAST College (Fareham College). It is also used as a base for glider clubs, light aeroplanes, HM Coastguard heliport and police aircraft.

In the west of Gosport is the naval base HMS &quot;Sultan&quot;. West of &quot;Sultan&quot; is the district of Rowner, which includes Alver Village.

There are several districts north, northwest and west of the town centre. These include areas that extend to the inland areas of the peninsula, Hardway (including Priddy&#x27;s Hard and Forton Lake) Elson, Brockhurst, Bridgemary and Rowner. Hoeford (A32 Gosport Road) is the most northwesterly area within Gosport, and ends at the boundary with the Borough of Fareham.

===Climate===
The climate of Gosport is milder than that of the surrounding areas, winter frosts being light and short-lived and snow quite rare. Temperatures rarely drop much below freezing, because the peninsula has water to the south and east. Portsdown Hill also protects the town from the cold northerly winds during the winter months. Located on the south coast, Gosport also receives more sunshine per annum than most of the UK. The average maximum temperature in January is 8C with the average minimum being 3C. The average maximum temperature in July is 21C, with the average minimum being 14C. The record high temperature is 32C and record low is -9C.

The Met Office has a weather station at the M.R.S.C. in Lee-on-the-Solent.

==History==
The Rowner area of the peninsula was settled by the Anglo-Saxons, and is mentioned in the &quot;Anglo Saxon Chronicle&quot; as Rughenor (&quot;rough bank or slope&quot;). Both Rowner and Alverstoke, the name coming from the point where the River Alver entered the Solent at Stokes Bay, were included in the Domesday Book. Rowner was the earliest known settlement of the peninsula, with many Mesolithic finds and a hunting camp being found, and tumuli on the peninsula investigated. Bronze Age items found in a 1960s construction in included a hoard of axe heads and torcs. A three-celled dwelling unearthed during construction of the Rowner naval Estate in the 1970s points to a settled landscape. Next to the River Alver which passes the southern and western edge of Rowner is a Norman motte and bailey, the first fortification of the peninsula, giving a vantage point over the Solent, Stokes Bay, Lee-on-the-Solent and the Isle of Wight.

Gosport Town Hall, designed by W. H. Saunders and Sons, was completed in 1964.

The former Rowner naval married quarters estate, now mostly demolished, and HMS &quot;Sultan&quot; were built on a former military airfield, known first as RAF Gosport and later as HMS &quot;Siskin&quot;, which gives its name to the local infant and junior schools. The barracks at Browndown (Stokes Bay) were used in the ITV series &quot;Bad Lads&#x27; Army&quot;.

== Government and politics ==
The borough is administered by Gosport Borough Council.

In the House of Commons, Gosport has been represented by Caroline Dinenage of the Conservative Party since 2010.

==Naval and military==

Until the last quarter of the 20th century, Gosport was a major naval town associated with the defence and supply infrastructure of His Majesty&#x27;s Naval Base (HMNB) Portsmouth. As such over the years extensive fortifications were created. 

The first fortifications were in 1678 during the reign on Charles II. These consisted of two forts, Fort James and Fort Charles, and a series of bastions and double ditches to encircle the town, known as the Gosport Lines. During the Georgian period in 1751 and 1752 they were rebuilt, enlarged and extended. Further additions were made in response to the French invasion threat of 1779. By 1860, the Gosport Lines had 58 guns. No.1 Bastion, for example, had mounted 14 guns in brick lined emplacements firing over the parapet. The 1859 Royal Commission on the Defences of the United Kingdom proposed the completion of a line of forts to protect the outer approach to Gosport town, making the earlier defences redundant. However, they were retained to constrain any expansion of the town towards the new line of forts. From the 1890s road widening meant some parts of the ramparts and gates were demolished. Further sections were demolished in the 1920s and 1960s. Today, the little that remain are protected ancient monuments.

The town is still home to and a Naval Armament Supply Facility as well as a Helicopter Repair base; however, Gosport&#x27;s naval history is very long, and the town has several buildings of historic interest as well as connections with many people who became famous. Most of the former naval and military installations have closed since the Second World War, leaving empty sites and buildings. In response to this, museums have opened, and many of the fortifications and installations (such as Fort Brockhurst, Priddy&#x27;s Hard (formerly an Armament Depot, now the Explosion! Museum of Naval Firepower) and the Royal Navy Submarine Museum in Haslar Road) have been opened to the public as tourism and heritage sites. One of the more recent additions is the Diving Museum at No 2 Battery at Stokes Bay which is bidding to become the National Diving Museum for the British Isles.

Several sites have also been redeveloped to provide housing, including the New Barracks (opened 1859, renamed St George Barracks in 1947, having served as HMS &quot;St George&quot; during the Second World War; closed 1991), the Royal Clarence Victualling Yard (opened 1828 on the site of an earlier victualling facility, closed 1992) and Royal Hospital Haslar (formerly the last military hospital of the UK: opened as a Royal Naval Hospital in 1753, later served other armed forces personnel and latterly the wider community of Gosport; closed as a military hospital in March 2007, the NHS withdrew in 2009 and the hospital closed). Forton Barracks (opened 1811, closed 1923, re-opened as in 1923, closed 1969) was part-demolished and is now St Vincent College.

There has also been extensive redevelopment of the harbour area as a marina.

=== Graves of Turkish sailors 1850–51 ===
In November 1850, two ships of the Ottoman Navy, &quot;Mirat-ı Zafer&quot; and &quot;Sürağ-ı Bahri Briki&quot;, anchored off the Hardway near Gosport. The visit lasted several months and during this time some of the members of the crew contracted cholera and were admitted to Haslar Hospital for treatment, where most of them died. In addition, some other sailors died because of training accidents. In total 26 died and were laid to rest in the grounds of Haslar. At the turn of the 20th century the bodies were exhumed and transferred to the R.N. Military Cemetery, Clayhall Road, in Alverstoke.

=== Preparations for the D Day Landings ===

In the first week of June 1944, tanks, scout cars and wheeled vehicles of the Sherbrooke Fusilier Regiment, Canadian Army loaded Landing craft tanks in Gosport. Convoys of vehicles had been carefully concealed from German discovery in the areas further inland, and in daylight on 3 June moved through Titchfield and Stubbington to G3 Hard on the Gosport waterfront. There, the M4 Sherman tanks were backed into position in preparation for the Channel crossing. The initial plan was for the invasion to begin on 5 June, but bad weather, with the various vessels riding at anchor off Calshot in the Solent, delayed the plans by one day.

==Transport==
Gosport has no railway station. However, it may be considered that the town does not require a railway station due to the ferry connection to Portsmouth Harbour. The Gosport Ferry provides quick access to Portsmouth Harbour railway station, terminus of the Portsmouth Direct Line to London. Due to heavy traffic (see below) this ferry is very well used. At one time the Gosport Ferry Company operated steam ferries, until the arrival in 1966 of two identical (and then very modern) diesel ferries, named &quot;Gosport Queen&quot; and &quot;Portsmouth Queen&quot;. In 1971 a third ferry called &quot;Solent Enterprise&quot; joined the fleet. She was a slightly larger, more luxurious version of the &quot;Queens&quot;. The company now operates two new modern ferries along with the two 1966 veterans. The first was built in 2001 and is named &quot;Spirit of Gosport&quot;. After the retirement of the &quot;Solent Enterprise&quot; in 2003, a second modern and slightly larger ferry was added to the fleet and was named the &quot;Spirit of Portsmouth&quot;. All ferries have been able to carry cycles and motorcycles.

Gosport received its railway before Portsmouth, but it closed to passengers in 1953. In 1841 a railway opened between the London and Southampton Railway at via to Gosport, where a terminus was built to an Italianate design of Sir William Tite. Gosport railway station was intended to serve Portsmouth across the water, but was sited at Gosport away from the harbour because the railway company was not allowed to breach either the Hilsea Lines, defences at the northern end of Portsea Island protecting Portsmouth, or the Gosport Lines protecting depots such as Royal Clarence Yard.

An extension to Royal Clarence Yard was opened in 1846, and branch lines to Stokes Bay (open from 1863 to 1915), and to Lee-on-the-Solent (open to passengers 1894 to 1931). Due to declining traffic, the connection to Fareham was closed for passenger services in 1953 and to freight traffic in 1969, although trains to the armament depot in Frater ran until the late 1970s.

The trackbed of the former Gosport – Fareham railway is now an exclusive fast bus route and cycle lane. Tite&#x27;s station building has been retained for its historical and architectural value and has been converted into a small number of residential properties and offices. The main gate in Spring Garden Lane has been opened up for vehicle access. A further development of six terraced homes has been built at the north western end of the site linking with George Street.

Being a peninsula town without a railway system, Gosport relies heavily upon the major A32 road in and out of the town. Plans existed in the 1970s to widen the road to accommodate expected increases in traffic flow, but this did not take place. In the early 1990s a computerised system controlling traffic lights along the route was installed to improve the rate of flow of traffic but this failed to work and had to be switched off since it could not cope with the traffic volumes. Now, in the 21st century, the A32 is much the same as it was thirty years ago and the traffic using it has increased to such an extent that the journey time to the nearby M27, about , can routinely take anything from 45 minutes and often longer at peak times between 07:30 &amp; 09:00 and 16:00 &amp; 18:30.

The station site was linked with the South Hampshire Rapid Transit scheme, which would have made use of the former railway route. However, due to Government refusal to fund the scheme, it was formally abandoned in November 2006. During 2010, construction started on the same route to provide a rapid bus route between the Holbrook area of Gosport and the town of Fareham. Now completed, regular service buses between Gosport and Fareham divert onto the new route avoiding lengthy queues on the A32 and speeding up commuting time between the towns for bus passengers. Gosport bus station serves the town.

===Proposed tunnel===
In 1999, a study was undertaken by the Light Rail Transit Association in regard to a proposed tunnel connecting Gosport to Portsmouth, crossing under Portsmouth Harbour. The study proposed a 670m Immersed tube which would not require long closures of the harbour to construct, and would alleviate traffic congestion in Gosport and the surrounding area. The tunnel was intended for construction in 2002, but financial problems delayed the project. The government declined to fund the initiative in 2005.

==Present day==
The 2001 Census recorded 54,854 people in Gosport of working age between the ages of 16 and 74. The economic activity of the residents in the Gosport Borough was 46.7% were in full-time employment, 12.9% were in part-time employment, 6.1% were self-employed, 2.7% were unemployed, 2.5% were students with jobs, 2.5% were students without jobs, 14% were retired, 6.2% were looking after the home or family and 3.8% were permanently sick or disabled.

As part of the &quot;Renaissance of Portsmouth Harbour&quot; Millennium project, a large sundial, known as the Millennium Timespace, was installed on the harbour front in 2000. Its timekeeping is partially restricted each day by shadowing caused by large tower blocks either side of the &#x27;timespace&#x27;. These towers, Seaward Tower and Harbour Tower, were built in 1963. Their surfaces are covered in mosaic murals designed by Kenneth Barden that rise the full height of the buildings and are illuminated at night. They were controversial initially but are now a tourist attraction. The tiles were produced by Poole Pottery. The International Festival of the Sea drew over 250,000 tourists to the Portsmouth Harbour area in 1998, 2001 and 2005. The most recent festival was held in 2007.

The Royal Navy maintains a presence in Gosport at HMS &quot;Sultan&quot;, which is the home of the Defence School of Marine Engineering (DSMarE) and the Royal Naval Air Engineering and Survival School (RNAESS). The &quot;Sultan&quot; site occupies of land within a perimeter and is the largest of the Royal Navy&#x27;s training establishments, with around 3,000 service and civilian personnel when working at full capacity.

There are public libraries at Bridgemary, Elson, and at Gosport Discovery Centre. In 2020, Hampshire County Council announced plans to close the council-run Elson library. Following this, a bid was made to save the library from closure, following consultations with the community. The library reopened on 12 May 2021, operating as Elson Community Library and Hub, registered as a charity.

==Culture==

In November 2022 the Gosport Museum and Art Gallery opened in the old Gosport Grammar School building. The building had previously been the Gosport Museum from 1975, and then the Gosport Gallery and reference library. The museum is run by Hampshire Cultural Trust. It is part of the council&#x27;s urban regeneration plans. One of the aims of Hampshire Cultural Trust is to get &quot;the community back in. We want to get the building back into use and the public back into the High Street ... [and to attract people] who do not normally go to museums&quot;.

The town has a theatre, Thorngate Hall, which was opened in 1960. It is named after an earlier Thorngate Hall, on a different site in South Street, which was destroyed by bombing in the Second World War. The earlier hall was built in 1885 and funded by the Thorngate Trust.

<text>In computer science and software programming, a value is the representation of some entity that can be manipulated by a program. The members of a type are the values of that type. 

The &quot;value of a variable&quot; is given by the corresponding mapping in the environment. In languages with assignable variables, it becomes necessary to distinguish between the &quot;r-value&quot; (or contents) and the &quot;l-value&quot; (or location) of a variable.

In declarative (high-level) languages, values have to be referentially transparent. This means that the resulting value is independent of the location of the expression needed to compute the value. Only the contents of the location (the bits, whether they are 1 or 0) and their interpretation are significant.

== Value category ==
Despite its name, in the C++ language standards this terminology is used to categorize expressions, not values.

=== Assignment: l-values and r-values ===
Some languages use the idea of l-values and r-values, deriving from the typical mode of evaluation on the left and right-hand side of an assignment statement. An l-value refers to an object that persists beyond a single expression. An r-value is a temporary value that does not persist beyond the expression that uses it.

The notion of l-values and r-values was introduced by Combined Programming Language (CPL). The notions in an expression of r-value, l-value, and r-value/l-value are analogous to the parameter modes of input parameter (has a value), output parameter (can be assigned), and input/output parameter (has a value and can be assigned), though the technical details differ between contexts and languages.

===R-values and addresses===
In many languages, notably the C family, l-values have storage addresses that are programmatically accessible to the running program (e.g., via some address-of operator like &quot;&amp;&quot; in C/C++), meaning that they are variables or de-referenced references to a certain memory location. R-values can be l-values (see below) or non-l-values—a term only used to distinguish from l-values. Consider the C expression . When executed, the computer generates an integer value of 13, but because the program has not explicitly designated where in the computer this 13 is stored, the expression is a non l-value. On the other hand, if a C program declares a variable x and assigns the value of 13 to x, then the expression has a value of 13 and is an l-value.

In C, the term l-value originally meant something that could be assigned to (hence the name, indicating it is on the left side of the assignment operator), but since the reserved word (constant) was added to the language, the term is now &#x27;modifiable l-value&#x27;. In C++11 a special semantic-glyph exists ( not to be confused with the codice_1 operator used for logical operations ), to denote the &quot;use/access of the expression&#x27;s address for the &quot;compiler&quot; only&quot;; i.e., the address cannot be retrieved using the address-of operator during the &quot;run-time&quot; of the program (see the use of move semantics). The addition of move semantics complicated the value classification taxonomy by adding to it the concept of an xvalue (expiring value) which refers to an object near the end of its lifetime whose resources can be reused (typically by moving them). This also lead to the creation of the categories glvalue (generalized lvalue) which are lvalues and xvalues and prvalues (pure rvalues) which are rvalues that are not xvalues.

This type of reference can be applied to &quot;all&quot; r-values including non-l-values as well as l-values. Some processors provide one or more instructions which take an immediate value, sometimes referred to as &quot;immediate&quot; for short. An immediate value is stored as part of the instruction which employs it, usually to load into, add to, or subtract from, a register. The other parts of the instruction are the opcode, and destination. The latter may be implicit. (A non-immediate value may reside in a register, or be stored elsewhere in memory, requiring the instruction to contain a direct or indirect address [e.g., index register address] to the value.)

The l-value expression designates (refers to) an object. A non-modifiable l-value is addressable, but not assignable. A modifiable l-value allows the designated object to be changed as well as examined. An r-value is any expression, a non-l-value is any expression that is not an l-value. One example is an &quot;immediate value&quot; (see above) and consequently not addressable.

== In assembly language ==
A value can be virtually any kind of data by a given data type, for instance a string, a digit, a single letter.

Processors often support more than one size of immediate data, e.g. 8 or 16 bit, employing a unique opcode and mnemonic for each instruction variant. If a programmer supplies a data value that will not fit, the assembler issues an &quot;Out of range&quot; error message. Most assemblers allow an immediate value to be expressed as ASCII, decimal, hexadecimal, octal, or binary data. Thus, the ASCII character is the same as or . The byte order of strings may differ between processors, depending on the assembler and computer architecture.

<doc id="338332" wikidata="Q485538" url="?curid=338332" title="Samguk yusa">
<text>Samguk yusa (; ) or Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms is a collection of legends, folktales, and historical accounts relating to the Three Kingdoms of Korea (Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla), as well as to other periods and states before, during, and after the Three Kingdoms period. It was compiled by the Buddhist monk Il-yeon in the late Goryeo dynasty, around 1280. It is the earliest extant record of the Dangun legend, which records the founding of Gojoseon as the first Korean nation. &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; is National Treasure No. 306.

&quot;Samguk yusa&quot; is a history record composed of five volumes divided into nine parts. It documents various tales and legends which are categorized into two parts: historical events and Buddhist narratives. The text contains various historical narratives such as tales of the Three Kingdoms period, myths, legends, genealogies, histories, and Buddhist tales, which have helped maintain folklore from medieval Korea. &quot;Yusa&quot; is a term used to describe a text that is supplementary to an earlier work. &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; is intended to provide additional information to texts such as the &quot;Samguk Sagi.&quot; The beginning of &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; describes Dangun Wanggeom, a mythological ancestor of all Koreans, founding the first nation of Korea, named &quot;Gojoseon.&quot; The text also contains several well-known tales such as &quot;Choshin&#x27;s Dream&quot; and &quot;Lady Suro&quot;.

== Background ==

&quot;Samguk yusa&quot; was written in the Ingak Temple in the 13th century. The author, Il-yeon, became a monk at the age of eight in 1214, working as an abbot in various temples, attending royal conferences at the king&#x27;s command, and hosting important Buddhist events until his death in 1289. 

The book was written during the Mongol conquest of Europe and East Asia, including China and Korea. Mongols invaded Korea for the first time in 1231. The invasion devastated the lives of Koreans by destroying valuable cultural properties, recordings, and literature. This invasion motivated Il-yeon to protect all of the folklore and stories handed down. Il-yeon collected and analyzed many works of Korean culture for a long period of time prior to the writing of &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;. The Korean peninsula was not yet united when the &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; was composed, so one of the &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; myths, Dangun, which is regarded as the root of all Koreans, has long been believed to have contributed to the idea of &quot;one blood, one nation&quot; among Koreans, as well as helping them to characterize themselves as a &quot;common blood race&quot;. 

However, there is also criticism that the sense of &quot;one blood&quot; could marginalize those who are not regarded as &quot;genuinely Korean&quot;, as well as restrict the different ways that people could consider themselves Korean by eliminating diverse and possible viewpoints that are not rooted in this conservative mythology. In order to honor and pass down Il-yeon&#x27;s achievements and life, the Inagak Temple holds annual festivals such as the Cultural Festival of Il-yeon Samguk Yusa under the assistance of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, and the festival activities include an academic seminar for academics, a writing contest for poems or essays, and poem recitation.

== Contents ==

&quot;Samguk yusa&quot; consists of two books containing a total of five volumes, divided into nine parts (fascicles): Wangryeok, Gii, Heungbeop, Tapsang, Uihae, Sinju, Gamtong, Pieun, and Hyoseon.

Wangnyeok is a brief chronology of the Three Kingdoms, Garakguk, Later Goguryeo, and Later Baekje. Gii contains the archive from Gojoseon to the late Three Kingdoms Period; it opens with an introductory passage explaining why it was written. Heungbeop is about the rise of Buddhism in the Three Kingdoms, and Tapsang includes pagodas and Buddhist images. Uihae contains narratives of famous monks during the Silla period. Sinju includes the tales about miracles that happened through esoteric Buddhism during the Silla dynasty. Gamtong is about stories of devotion. Pieun contains the legends of solitary heroes. Hyoseon contains folktales of filial piety and Buddhist virtues. Although it is divided into many parts, the composition of the entire book can be briefly described below:
==Authorship and dating==

The text was written in Classical Chinese, which was used by literate Koreans at the time of its composition. The earliest version of the text is believed to have been compiled in the 1280s, and the earliest extant publication of the text is from 1512.

20th-century Korean scholars such as Choe Nam-seon established the Buddhist monk Il-yeon (1206–1289) as the main compiler of the text, on the basis that his name (and full official title) was indicated in the fifth fascicle. This view is widely accepted among modern scholars. The compilation is believed to have been expanded by Il-yeon&#x27;s disciple Muguk (1250–1322) and several others prior to the definitive 1512 recension.

Ha Chongnyong and Yi Kunjik produced a critical edition of &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; in 1997. According to Ha Chongnyong, Il-yeon wrote only the fifth fascicle, since his name is mentioned only in that section of the text.

The 1512 edition of the text mentions a dynastic chronology at the beginning, which has several discrepancies with the information that appears later in the text. According to Robert Buswell, Jr. and Donald S. Lopez, Jr., this chronology may have been a 14th-century addition to Il-yeon&#x27;s compilation.

== National heritage ==
&quot;Samguk yusa&quot; is considered an extremely important cultural heritage representing ancient Korean history and culture. It includes ancient literary works about history, Buddhism, and legends, most of which does not exist in modern times.

Moreover, the &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; is one of a limited number of sources for the study of ancient Korean language systems. In particular, its fourteen pieces of &quot;hyangga&quot; (ancient Korean folk songs) are especially important in the study of classical Korean literature. Additionally, Il-yeon uses different styles of writing, including ones from the Sinitic Buddhist Culture.

The book also includes plenty of information on Buddhist art, the dominant type of art in ancient Korean art history. In particular, Tapsang (part 4), &quot;which mainly focuses on the founding of pagodas, Buddhist images and temples, is an essential source for the study of various remains and relics of both historical and archeological value.&quot; Lastly, the book includes various written records about young soldiers during the Silla dynasty.

== Comparison with &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; ==
&quot;Samguk sagi&quot; and &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; are often compared in terms of Korean history books, both holding a prominent place in Korean history. In terms of similarity, both of them were written by Koryo scholars who believed they were descended from Silla rather than Koguryo. This belief contributed to the emphasis of Silla history as the main focus of both the &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; and &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;. However, the two works differ in authorship: while the author of &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; was a devoted Buddhist monk, &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; was written by a Confucian scholar-statesman, Kim Pu-shik, allowing readers to access the two different historical works from the differing perspectives of Buddhist monk or Confucian official.

According to the Cultural Heritage Administration of Korea, &quot;the book contains a wide range of records about young soldiers of the Silla Period, which are more religious and poetical than those written in &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;.&quot; On the other hand, studies have found that &quot;&quot;Samguk Sagi&quot; was almost immediately accepted as one of the most definitive histories of its time and within several decades was read even in China.&quot; Therefore, it can be considered that even though the &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; was written a century later, Il-yeon considerably relied on the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;. Moreover, the &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; contains the historical elements not found in the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;. Since it is also the same in reserve, it is found that the two works complement each other.

Kim Pu-shik attempted a more rational and logical approach towards the historical writings, whereas the romantic Buddhism approach of &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; of the Koryo dynasty allowed the readers to experience the old historical cultures such as superstitions, folklore, and mythical stories. Both of the historical books are also generally focused on certain backgrounds in terms of religion. Despite the reasonable writing of the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, nationalist historians and scholars refer to it as a Chinese Confucian-centered book, arguing that it instils a subordinate attitude (&quot;sadae&quot;), with the ancient tradition ignored. In contrast, in the case of &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;, the majority of the text is dedicated to Buddhism, tailored to the Korean style under the author&#x27;s influence; the only occurrence of Confucianism is in Hyoseon (part 9), which expresses filial piety as a way of Buddhism. Naturally, the contents of &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; were influenced more greatly by Il-yeon&#x27;s Buddhist values than was the case for &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;. Il-yeon&#x27;s work provides four bizarre stories depicting the discovery of archaeological artifacts to demonstrate the existence of Buddhism in the pre-modern era, the time of the tale&#x27;s telling.

Buddhist stories, including both the principles of Buddhism and various Buddhist monks, account for nearly half (49.5%) of the total writing in &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;. In terms of adequate factual delivery, &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; conveys relatively insufficient historical information, such as about the explanation of &quot;kwallogup&quot; (officials&#x27; land) and &quot;sigup&quot; (the land for producing food), which are well described in &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; in detail. Nonetheless, the &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; and &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; are mutually regarded as complementary regarding uncompleted ancient recordings among Koreans today.

==Historical reliability==
Many of the founding legends of the various kingdoms in Korean history are recorded in &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;. The text covers legends from many Korean kingdoms, including Gojoseon, Wiman Joseon, Buyeo, Goguryeo, Baekje, Silla, and Gaya. Unlike the more factually oriented &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, the &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; focuses on various folktales, legends, and biographies from early Korean history. Given its mythical narratives, the reliability of &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; is questionable.

The author attempted to keep original phrases drawn from various sources—including Chinese Buddhist literature, Korean historical literature, and languages written in epigraphy—and he sometimes omitted unnecessary phrases or paraphrased several expressions with the intention of integrating them into the whole story. In terms of Il-yeon&#x27;s research approach, he regarded the quality and quantity of the resources as crucial elements for his work, used the &quot;inserted textual commentary&quot; in order to seriously evaluate his resources, allowed readers to access comparative information about the history, and even expressed concerns about the reliability when there was insufficient information to depict. Moreover, Il-yeon attempted to use various versions of the same story when he recorded folktales and myths. For instance, he comments that the story of Tangun was quoted from both the &quot;Wei-shu&quot; (&quot;&quot;Wei Dynasty History&quot;) and &quot;Tangun Kogi&quot; (&quot;Ancient Record of Tangun&quot;&quot;). This comment is valuable because both these source history books are not accessible now. The inscription of &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; is also a relatively credible source, but its contents are mainly confined to the mobilization of the peasantry for dike construction and the description of land property for the temple. 

There is also skepticism surrounding &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;. It would not have been able to precisely interpret and explain the detailed picture of Silla, as it was written in the Koryo period, roughly twelve centuries after the Three Kingdoms Period. Significantly, stories of the other nations of the three-kingdom period (Koguryo and Paekche) are excluded. The overwhelming bulk are Silla stories, especially the stories that came from Korea&#x27;s south-eastern region of &quot;Kyngsang&quot;, known as Il-yeon&#x27;s place of birth. With regard to religion, Confucianism—highly influential in both China and Korea—was marginally dealt with in the Buddhism-dominant &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; tales as a subjugated religion. For example, in the &quot;Tale of the Monk Chinjong&quot;, Chinjong&#x27;s filial reasons for not wanting to enter the monastic life are countered by his mother, suggesting that monastic life is regarded as even more filial behaviour than ignoring filial piety. 

One bias of the &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; is that it chiefly relays stories of the upper class of Silla instead of the ordinary people. The aristocracy and members of the upper class constitute over half of the total number of narrative protagonists, with the figures correlated with Buddhist monks or nuns making up approximately twenty-five percent, and commoners only making up around eight percent of the contexts. Although historical interpretations of the content of the &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; are dependent on the resources Il-yeon chose to include, the book is nonetheless worthwhile in comprehending the overall landscape of Silla. 

== Influences on Korean Buddhism tradition ==
The Three Kingdom Period is the age of the start of various institutions, teachings, religious practices, and cults. As the tales in &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; describes the birth of these traditions, these tales are both descriptive and prescriptive—they have been the source of the Korean Buddhist tradition up to the present day. The places mentioned in the book are also important religious points in modern-day South Korea. For instance: &quot;The naming of mountains in &quot;Samguk Yusa&quot; connects Korea with China and India and symbolically recreates the actual sacred places of Buddhism in Korea.&quot;

Many stories in &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; contain a common topos, wherein sacred remains of temples and statues are located or revealed at important locations. In Korean tradition, this hierophany almost exclusively takes place at or on mountains. As an example, tales describe Odaesan (五臺山) to be the home of a bodhisattva, in direct symbolic emulation of the Chinese Wutaishan Mountain (五臺山). The mountains were later changed into one large religious area encompassing multiple temples and shrines. In another story, &quot;The Sixteen-foot Buddha Statue at Hwangnyongsa (皇龍寺丈六)&quot;, Korea is presented &quot;as a country with the best karmic conditions in the world for building a large statue of the Buddha, even more suitable than India, the home of Buddhism.&quot; The king selects &quot;a piece of high and clear ground&quot; for the creation and enshrinement of the large statue, and it is successfully cast on the first attempt. Here, Korea is painted to be &quot;the true home of Buddhism&quot;.

== Legends and tales ==
The text covers a wide range of subjects, including geography, literature, religion, art, and folklore, as well as ancient history. The stories naturally came from the lives of Goryeo people under the extreme suffering in the Mongol-dominant era in order to strengthen both a sense of national identity and descendance from a common ancestor. Among them, there are representative stories.

=== &quot;Lady Suro&quot; ===
When Soon Jeong-gong has lunch at Imhaejeong Pavilion while taking office as Gangneung Taesu during King Seongdeok&#x27;s reign, Soon Jeong&#x27;s wife, Lady Suro, sees that the royal azalea flowers are in full bloom. At her request, Soon Jeong picks a flower for her. After this, a dragon suddenly appears from the sea, dragging Lady Suro into the sea. An old man, walking along the street with a cow, appears and says, &quot;If you gather the people and sing a song and hit the river hill with a cane, you will be able to meet your wife.&quot; Her husband follows the old man&#x27;s advice, and the dragon returns his wife. This story portrays Lady Suro&#x27;s unparalleled beauty that the water souls cannot ignore.

=== &quot;Choshin&#x27;s Dream&quot; ===
Choshin, a monk who adores Kim Nang-Ja, enthusiastically begs Gwaneum Bodhisattva to realise love with her. However, one day, he hears that she has married, and Choshin falls asleep resenting the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva. But when Kim Nang-ja comes in the night and asks to have a relationship, they joyfully go to his hometown and live together for more than 40 years. He has five children, but in his poverty, his 15-year-old child starves to death while they pass through Haehyeonryeong Pass in Myeongju, and he fails to hold a funeral. When Kim Nang-ja says, &quot;Let&#x27;s break up with each other rather than continue the miserable life as it is,&quot; Choshin agrees, and after sharing the children with each other, he awakens from his dream. After experiencing a miserable life of poverty and bareness in a dream, he realizes how vain human life is.

== Collections ==

=== Kyujanggak Collection ===
This copy of the &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; is owned by the Kyujanggak Institute for Korean Studies. This book is known as the earliest edition of &quot;Samguk Yusa&quot;. It is the only complete book without missing pages, out of all the copies published in Gyeongju in 1512 (the 7th year of the reign of King Jungjong of the Joseon Dynasty), which is the earliest extant edition. This copy is most used by academic scholars in research.

=== Beomeosa Temple Collection ===
The Beomeosa &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; (one book composed of volumes 4 and 5), designated as National Treasure No. 306-4, is kept at Beomeosa Temple in Busan in the form of one book not including volumes 1 to 3. Two woodblock-printed editions of &quot;Sanguk yusa&quot; have been excavated in addition to this copy, and they have been designated as National Treasure Nos. 306 and 306-3. Even though this edition is an incomplete set, researchers regard it as highly valuable. It is the first printed copy of the &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; to have been engraved on wood in 1934. This edition is considered meaningful from both the historical and academic perspectives as it is a crucial copy for the restoration of the original woodblock-printed copy of the &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;, given that it is the only source which includes Chapters 28, 29, and 30 (missing from the other copies), along with the missing letters and errors in the copy published in 1512. Additionally, the collection at Beomeosa Temple is found to be closely related to the 1512 publication in terms of its font, size, and spacing between the lines, which shows its importance for bibliographical research was recognized even during the Joseon dynasty. Moreover, as it contains information on how to read the Chinese characters used in the text in Hangul (Korean alphabet), it is an applicable material for researchers of Korea’s ancient language. It was designated as the national treasure of the Republic of Korea on August 27, 2020.

=== Korea University Collection ===
This book contains volumes 3-5 of &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;. The first 10 pages of volume 3, and pages 18 to 31 of volume 5 (total of 23 pages) are missing. The cover of this book was restored, and the five-hole woven with a red thread was used for the title page. This book was kept by Choe Nam-seon, and was later donated to Korea University in Seoul.

This book originated from the edition published in Gyeongju in 1512. The Korea Heritage Service states that &quot;The book belongs to the copy withdrawn relatively early among other extant copies of the Jeongdeok Edition of &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;, and has value as the bibliography of the Jeongdeok Edition (also known as the Imshin Edition of King Jungjong).&quot; It is the only copy of the Jeongdeok Edition to include Korean endings on the Chinese characters.

=== Jung-gu Collection ===
The Jung-gu version of &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; is the only copy with volume 2 and no other volumes. In this copy, 4 sheets (17-20) out of 49 pages of the text were restored. The cover is restored in a &quot;manja&quot; pattern with a five-needle red thread, and the binding is in good condition.

On the front cover, &quot;Hwangmajungyangwolmaedeuk Nisannamssigajang&quot; is written with ink in the center. Moreover, the word &quot;Nisanjang&quot; on the middle of back cover indicates that it was purchased and kept by a person with surname Nam in February of the 55th year of the Chinese sexagenary cycle. In terms of structure, 24 out of 49 pages are generally longer than 1 cm in length compared to Jeongdeokbon edition. In terms of content, it can be seen that it was published in the early Joseon dynasty, as they were written in the style to avoid the names of Goryeo dynasty&#x27;s kings. Moreover, it includes many differences compared to the 1512 Jeongdeok edition, and therefore acts as a reference to compare and correct the mistakes in the Jeongdeok edition.

=== Seodaemun-gu Collection ===
This copy of &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;, designated as National Treasure of Korea (No. 306-3) is an early Joseon edition. Along with a royal calendar, the brief chronology of Silla, Goguryeo, Baekje, Gaya, and Unified Silla, Later Goguryeo (including Goryeo), and Later Baekjae, it contains the records of mythical events (historical and cultural facts from the Gojoseon to the Late Three Kingdoms period). Even though only volumes 3 and 5 remain, this copy is valuable in that it is a complete edition without any missing pages as an early Joseon book. Importantly, it can supplement letters that are difficult to read among copies of the 1512 edition, and identify cited literary works of which there are no extant copies.

=== Jongno-gu Collection ===
This book is a collection of three volumes: 3, 4, and 5. The title, &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;, is written in large letters and in small letters, and written as &quot;Seokju&quot; on the blue silk cover of the book. Every damaged and missing part of the copy was repaired and fully recovered to match the original contents. The volume consists of total 107 pages: 50 pages of the third chapter (missing first 6 pages), 31 pages of the fourth chapter, and 26 pages of the fifth chapter (missing last 4 pages). On the other hand, it is possible that most of the early Joseon books were not applied to the subjects of the Goryeo kings&#x27; names, such as Yong (the father of King Taejo) and Mu (the name of Hyejong), who were replaced by other characters in honor and &quot;samga&quot;. In terms of content, there are many differences in text compared to the 1512 Jeongdeokbon edition. Moreover, it is a valuable resource to correct errors in the edition in early Joseon period and it also works as a bibliography.

<doc id="338333" wikidata="Q787743" url="?curid=338333" title="Robert B. Crosby">
<text>Robert Berkey Crosby (March 26, 1911 – January 7, 2000) was an American Republican politician who served as the 27th governor of Nebraska from 1953 to 1955.

Crosby was born in North Platte, Nebraska. After attending Hastings College, Crosby transferred to the University of Minnesota. He received a B.A. degree from the University of Minnesota in 1931 and an LL.B. degree from Harvard Law School in 1935.

Crosby served in the Nebraska Legislature from 1941 to 1945. He was chosen speaker of the Unicameral in 1943 and, at 31, was the youngest person ever to hold that position. After volunteering for two years in the United States Navy, Crosby served as Nebraska&#x27;s 24th lieutenant governor, from 1947 to 1949. While Lieutenant Governor, Crosby wrote &quot;Why I Want to Get Rid of My Job.&quot;

Governor Crosby, who was known as &quot;The Boy Governor from North Platte,&quot; was particularly proud that he was a great-grandson of John Holbrook Powers. &quot;Honest John&quot; Powers ran for governor of Nebraska as a populist in 1890.

In April 1954, Governor Crosby appointed Eva Bowring to the U.S. Senate to fill out the term of the late Dwight Griswold. In July 1954, Governor Crosby appointed Samuel Williams Reynolds to the U.S. Senate to fill out the term of the late Hugh A. Butler.

Crosby was a candidate for the U.S. Senate in the Republican primary in 1954, but was defeated by Carl T. Curtis. U.S. Senator Hazel H. Abel, who had been elected to serve the last two months of the term of the late Dwight Griswold, resigned a few days before the end of her term, and Governor Crosby appointed Curtis to serve the remainder of her term. That gave Senator Curtis slightly more seniority than other senators elected at the same time.

Gov. Crosby was also known for his speaking ability. He had the ability to adapt to his audience. His style of logical, ethical and emotional appeal was used both in political speeches and in his law practice. One of the most public aspects of his legal work was the defense of Duane Pope for murder. Crosby&#x27;s speaking style using combinations of support (logical, ethical and emotional ) helped distinguish him from his colleagues (Nykodym, 1968).

Crosby called, in 1953, for the closure of the Milford Industrial Home, one of the few homes in the nation for unwed mothers: &quot;I do not think that Nebraska taxpayers are so affluent that they should indulge themselves in this exceptional activity&quot;. It closed later that year.

Following his service as governor, Crosby practiced law in Lincoln, Nebraska, until shortly before his death in 2000. In 1971, he married LaVon Crosby, a Nebraska state senator from 1989 to 2000. He is buried in Lincoln Memorial Park in Lincoln.

<text>Aflac Incorporated (American Family Life Assurance Company) is an American insurance company and is the largest provider of supplemental insurance in the United States. It was founded in 1955 and is based in Columbus, Georgia. In the U.S., it underwrites a wide range of insurance policies, but is perhaps more known for its payroll deduction insurance coverage, which pays cash benefits when a policyholder has a covered accident or illness. The company states it &quot;provides financial protection to more than 50 million people worldwide&quot;.

In 2009, Aflac acquired Continental American Insurance Company for $100 million, enabling them to sell supplemental insurance on both the individual and group platforms. , it was represented by approximately 19,300 sales agencies in Japan and 76,900 licensed sales associates in the U.S.

==History==
The company was founded by brothers John, Paul (died 2014), and William Amos in Columbus, Georgia, in 1955, as American Family Life Insurance Company of Columbus. In 1964, the company name was changed to American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus. The company had an initial public offering in 1974 and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1990, the company adopted the Aflac acronym, although the official name of the underwriting subsidiary remains American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus. Aflac announced the appointment of Frederick J. Crawford as Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President in June 2015.

The company signed 6,426 policyholders in its first year. Aflac pioneered cancer insurance in 1958. Beginning in 1964, the company decided to focus sales on worksite settings, eventually through policies sponsored by employers and funded through payroll deductions. By 2003, more than 98% of Aflac policies in the United States were issued on a payroll deduction basis, making the company a leader in that approach to policy distribution.

==Business==
Aflac operates in the United States and Japan, and has its worldwide headquarters and corporate offices in an eighteen-story tower just east of Downtown Columbus, Georgia, in an area known as MidTown. The Aflac tower is the tallest building in the city. , the corporation&#x27;s total assets were more than $103 billion, and the company insured more than 50 million people worldwide.

Aflac is the largest provider of guaranteed-renewable insurance in the United States and the largest insurance company overall in Japan, when measured by individual insurance policies in force.

The company now offers several types of insurance policies in the United States, including the following:
* Accident
* Cancer/Specified Disease
* Dental
* Hospital Confinement Indemnity
* Hospital Confinement Sickness Indemnity
* Hospital Intensive Care
* Life
* Lump Sum Cancer
* Lump Sum Cancer Critical Illness
* Specified Health Event
* Short Term Disability
* Vision

Aflac also offers un-reimbursed medical, dependent day-care, and transportation flexible spending accounts. The company additionally offers human resources services for HIPAA and COBRA. From 1979 to 1997, the company owned several television stations, most of them in small and medium markets. It sold the broadcasting division (including flagship station WTVM) to what became Raycom Media in 1997.

Aflac is ranked 137th in the Fortune 500 list of largest United States corporations by revenue.

==Critics of cancer policies==
Consumer groups and some government officials say that cancer insurance returns fewer premium dollars to policyholders than standard insurance. A United States General Accounting Office study found that the policies paid back as little as 35% of premiums (Aflac said its cancer insurance paid back 62.4%). In comparison, New York State requires most major-medical policies to pay back 82% and group policies to pay back 75%. New York State does not allow stand-alone cancer policies.

In 1997, AFLAC spent $175,000 on lobbyists and campaign contributions to change the law. New York State lifted its ban in 1998 for purchasers who already have basic coverage. Consumer Reports recommended that policyholders use the money instead to buy lower-deductible insurance.

==The Aflac Duck==
Since December 1999, the company&#x27;s identity and brand has become more widely recognized in the United States as the result of TV commercials featuring the Aflac Duck, who quacks the company&#x27;s name with frustration to unsuspecting prospective policy holders. The duck concept and all of the commercials to date have been created by Kaplan Thaler Group, an advertising agency based in New York City. Metzer Farms, a Gonzales, California, waterfowl and gamebird hatchery, supplied them with the initial ducklings that each grew into the famous duck. Struggling to come up with a concept to make the big but relatively obscure insurance company&#x27;s name memorable, one of the agency&#x27;s art directors stumbled upon the duck idea while walking around Central Park at lunchtime uttering, &quot;Aflac, Aflac.&quot; He soon realized how much the company&#x27;s name sounded like a duck&#x27;s quack. The Aflac Duck character has now starred in more than 30 commercials. In many of these commercials, character actor Earl Billings also appears. The Aflac Duck is enshrined on Madison Avenue&#x27;s Walk of Fame as one of America&#x27;s Favorite Advertising Icons.

From 2003 to 2006, when both NASCAR on NBC and NASCAR on TNT were scheduled to televise the second half of the Cup Series Season, they ran a 30-second segment in certain parts of each and every race they broadcast, called, &quot;The Aflac Trivia Quiz&quot;. The segment would always begin when NASCAR on NBC-TNT Commentator/Cup Series Champion Benny Parsons would segue the topics he would be talking about by saying, &quot;Cue the Duck!&quot;

Celebrities have starred in the Aflac ads, including Chevy Chase (2003); Yogi Berra; Yao Ming; future First Lady of the United States, Melania Trump (2005); NASCAR Cup Series driver Carl Edwards (2008–2014); the United States Olympic synchronized swimming team (2004); and Wayne Newton playing at Stardust Hotel and Casino for the 2003 commercial. The duck also appeared with Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner, and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. In 2005, the company logo was changed to incorporate the duck. The first commercial using the new logo featured Gilbert Gottfried at a pet store because the duck kept saying, &quot;Aflac!&quot; and he had to trade in the duck for a parrot, saying, &quot;If you&#x27;re hurt and can&#x27;t work&quot;.

The duck was originally voiced by comedian Gilbert Gottfried, who also voiced Digit on the PBS Kids series &quot;Cyberchase&quot; and Iago in the Disney film &quot;Aladdin&quot;. After 11 years as the voice of the Aflac duck, Gottfried was dismissed on March 14, 2011, due to jokes on Gottfried&#x27;s Twitter account referencing the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. The company&#x27;s chief marketing officer stated that &quot;Gilbert&#x27;s recent comments about the crisis in Japan were lacking in humor, and certainly do not represent the thoughts and feelings of anyone at Aflac.&quot;

On March 23, 2011, Aflac announced that the company was taking applications for the new voice of the Aflac Duck through QuackAflac.com until April 1. Commercials requesting the submissions, first aired in 2006 but updated, resemble a silent movie. On April 26, 2011, it was announced that Daniel McKeague, a television advertising sales manager from Hugo, Minnesota, would be the new voice of the Aflac duck. The first Aflac commercial featuring the duck&#x27;s new voice aired on May 1, 2011.

In 2018, an Aflac ad inserted an animated Aflac duck into the opening credits of the &quot;DuckTales&quot; reboot.

==Corporate philanthropy and social responsibility==
The company states that through a partnership with Children&#x27;s Healthcare of Atlanta, Aflac has contributed more than $100 million to childhood cancer research and treatment.

Aflac employees are formally involved in an array of charitable organizations such as Habitat for Humanity International, the Easter Seals, and the United Way.

Aflac&#x27;s stated objectives include the decrease of its environmental impact, for which the company is into a partnership with the Clean Air Campaign to encourage employees to engage with greater frequency in alternate commuting methods.

==Aflac and Macy&#x27;s Partnership==
Starting in 2001, Aflac and Macy&#x27;s have partnered to sell the annual Aflac holiday plush duck in select Macy&#x27;s stores nationwide. Net proceeds from each duck sold are donated to the participating children&#x27;s cancer facility nearest to where it is purchased. Since 2001, more than $3 million has been raised from the sale of the ducks.

Aflac has participated in the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade from 2011 to 2019.

==Award programs==

Aflac National High School Baseball Player of the Year, which was first presented in 2004.

The Jackie Robinson Award is given to the high-school player who is entering his senior year and who best displays character, leadership, and the values of being a student athlete in academics and community affairs. The award is presented at an annual All-American Awards banquet, which was first held in 2003. The banquet follows the annual All-American Baseball Classic, an East-West all-star game featuring the 38 best players from around the nation who are entering their senior year of high school. First held in 2003, the game is played at Petco Park, San Diego, California. Proceeds from the game and banquet are donated to Rady Children&#x27;s Hospital in San Diego and its fight against childhood cancer.

In 2011, the name of the all-star game was changed to the Perfect Game All-American Classic.

<doc id="338336" wikidata="Q210988" url="?curid=338336" title="All-terrain vehicle">
<text>An all-terrain vehicle (ATV), also known as a light utility vehicle (LUV), a quad bike or quad (if it has four wheels), as defined by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), is a vehicle that travels on low-pressure tires, has a seat that is straddled by the operator, and has handlebars, similar to a motorcycle. As the name implies, it is designed to handle a wider variety of terrain than most other vehicles. It is street-legal in some countries, but not in most states, territories and provinces of Australia, the United States, and Canada.

By the current ANSI definition, ATVs are intended for use by a single operator, but some ATVs, referred to as tandem ATVs, have been developed for use by the driver and one passenger.

The rider sits on and operates these vehicles like a motorcycle, but the extra wheels give more stability at slower speeds. Although most are equipped with three or four wheels, six or eight wheel (tracked) models exist and have existed historically for specialized applications. Multiple-user analogues with side-by-side seating are called utility terrain vehicles (UTVs) or side-by-sides to distinguish the classes of vehicle. Both classes tend to have similar powertrain parts. Engine sizes of ATVs for sale in the United States as of 2008 ranged from .

==History==
===19th century===

Royal Enfield built and sold the first powered four-wheeler in 1893. It had many bicycle components, including handlebars. The Royal Enfield resembles a modern ATV-style quad bike but was designed as a form of horseless carriage for road use.

===Six-wheeled AATVs===

The term &quot;ATV&quot; was originally coined to refer to non-straddle ridden, typically six-wheeled, amphibious ATVs, such as the Jiger produced by the Jiger Corporation, the Amphicat produced by Mobility Unlimited Inc, and the Terra Tiger produced by the Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company in the mid-1960s and early 1970s. With the introduction of straddle ridden ATVs, the term AATV was introduced to define the original amphibious ATV category.

===Three-wheeled ATVs===
The first three-wheeled ATV was the Sperry-Rand Tricart. It was designed in 1967 as a graduate project of John Plessinger at the Cranbrook Academy of Arts near Detroit. The Tricart was straddle-ridden with a sit-in rather than sit-on style (similar to the contemporaneous Big Wheel toy). In 1968 Plessinger sold the Tricart patents and design rights to Sperry-Rand New Holland who manufactured them commercially. Numerous small American manufacturers of 3-wheelers followed. These small manufacturers were unable to compete when larger motorcycle companies like Honda entered the market in 1969.

Honda introduced their first sit-on straddle-ridden three-wheeled all-terrain vehicle in 1969, known as a US90, as a 1970 Model. Variations would be popularized in the James Bond movie, &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; and TV shows such as &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; and &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;. In 1973, Honda trademarked the term &quot;All Terrain Cycle&quot; (ATC), applying it to all Honda&#x27;s three-wheeled ATVs; it became a universal name associated with all vehicles of this type. It was directly influenced by earlier 6-wheeled AATVs of the sixties, and utilized balloon tires for both a low environmental impact and to compensate for a lack of mechanical suspension.

Honda entered the 1980s with a virtual monopoly in the market, due to effective patents on design and engine placement. By 1980, other companies paid patent royalties to Honda to enter the lucrative ATC field with their own machines. Yamaha introduced their first ATC, the Tri-Moto YZ125. Kawasaki followed suit the next year with the KLT200, while Suzuki produced their first model, the ALT125, in 1982. As the popularity of ATCs increased dramatically, rapid development ensued. The ability to go anywhere on terrain that most other vehicles could not cross soon made them popular with US and Canadian hunters. As other manufacturers were entering the market, Honda was diversifying, offering the ATC250R, the first Sport ATC intended for competition, in 1981. The 1982 Honda ATC200E Big Red was a landmark model. It featured both suspension and racks, making it the first ATC designed specifically for utility, and would become the world&#x27;s best-selling ATC. Honda followed that effort in 1983 with the ATC200X, an easy-to-handle four-stroke Sport ATC that was ideal for new riders.

Not to be outdone, Kawasaki and Yamaha responded with their own Sport ATCs. 1984 saw the release of the Kawasaki KXT250 Tecate, and Yamaha followed in 1985 with the Tri-Z 250. Both were liquid Cooled 250 cc two-strokes capable of giving the Honda ATC250R competition. In response to growing market, American Specialty manufacturer Tiger also introduced a series of ATCs, hand-built-to-order models that included the Tiger 500, the largest displacement ATC produced commercially. While Kawasaki and Yamaha both produced utility ATCs, famously making the KLT 250 Police and Yamahauler respectively, Suzuki turned their attention to building Sport Quads.

Honda continued to diversify their line-up (at peak offering 10 distinct models), releasing the larger, fully suspended 250 cc Big Red utility ATC, and introduced the 350X Sport ATC, their largest displacement machine, in 1985. But the bulk of their sales were the 200cc line, offering six models and selling over 500,000 units in 3 years. Honda&#x27;s response to the Tecate and Tri-Z, the liquid cooled 1985 and 1986 ATC250R, remains one of the most desirable ATCs of the era, and aftermarket support still follows the machine.

====U.S. manufacturers====
Main articles: Tiger ATV LTD and Polaris Scrambler 250R/es

American-based manufacturers also produced ATCs in this period, albeit in small numbers. Polaris offered the Scrambler in 1985 and 1986, producing appx 1600 units. Speciality manufacturer Tiger ATV also produced a range of ATCs, but their liquidation in 1991 left no official record of how many units were produced. The collector ATV market estimates vary drastically, from 300 to as many as 1000 units total production. Tiger ATCs were offered for three years, with models using two-stroke engines provided by KTM and Rotax.

The Tiger 500 is notable for being the fastest consumer ATC available, with tested top speeds of +80 mph from the stock @6500rpm engine and 5 speed gearbox. With final drive gearing changes, the ATC could exceed 100 mph. However, due to the rarity of the machines the brand never became well-known, and as all Tiger Models were custom-ordered and built to the buyer&#x27;s specifications for the purpose of factory ATV racing, Polaris is generally known as the first American &#x27;Production&#x27; ATV producer.

====Production pause====
Production of three-wheelers was voluntarily ceased by all manufacturers by 1987, in light of safety concerns, and ahead of any legislation. Though later studies showed that three-wheelers were not considered more unstable than four-wheelers (although accidents are equally severe in both classes), manufacturers agreed to a 10-year moratorium on production, and to collectively financing a +US$100 million ATV safety campaign. Despite the moratorium lifting, manufacturers did not return to the ATC market, focusing instead on four-wheeled ATVs. A ban on sales of new or used three-wheelers and a recall of all remaining three-wheelers was proposed by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

These safety issues with three-wheel ATCs caused a shift in the buying public, as the sales of later four-wheel ATV models grew rapidly. While three-wheel models ended production in 1987, agreements between the major manufacturers and the US U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission to officially cease production and finance safety campaigns moved forward. While the lighter weight of ATCs made them popular with certain riders, manufacturers continued to focus on ATV production.

====US Public Law 110-314====
US Public Law 110-314, enacted on August 8, 2008, separated ATCs from existing new production ATV safety standards, and requires new standards for three-wheeled ATCs to be drafted. This effectively suspended importation of three-wheeled ATCs, until new standards of safety can be drafted. As of 2020, such standards have not been drafted. While search engines can find informal information suggesting major Japanese manufacturers pressed for this measure due to an influx of inexpensive Chinese ATCs in the American market, no official documentation or cited sources support these claims. Currently, all manufacturers not based in the US are restricted from the manufacture and sale of new Three-Wheeled All Terrain Cycles, until safety standards can be implemented. Below is a summary of Section 232, which effects the ATC ban.

===Four-wheeled ATVs (since 1980)===
Suzuki was a leader in the development of mass production four-wheeled ATVs. It sold the first model, the 1982 QuadRunner LT125, which was a recreational machine for beginners.

Adventure Vehicles of Monroe, Louisiana made the first quad ATV in 1980. They called it the Avenger 400. Prior to that, Adventure Vehicles made 3 wheel ATVs and a dump body utility 3 wheeler using Kohler 8 hp engines and Comet drive systems (Comet centrifugal belt-driven clutch, and a Comet forward, neutral, reverse transaxle, with a rigid rear axle or rear differential option.) The Avenger 400 was a rigid suspension vehicle with a fiberglass body and welded tube construction. It was a rudimentary vehicle reminiscent of the Tote Gote of the 1960s.

Suzuki sold the first four-wheeled mini ATV, the LT50, from 1984 to 1987. After the LT50, Suzuki sold the first ATV with a CVT transmission, the LT80, from 1987 to 2006.

In 1985 Suzuki introduced to the industry the first high-performance four-wheel ATV, the Suzuki LT250R QuadRacer. This machine was in production for the 1985–1992 model years. During its production run, it underwent three major engineering makeovers. However, the core features were retained. These were: a sophisticated long-travel suspension, a liquid-cooled, two-stroke motor, and a fully-manual five-speed transmission (for 1985–1986 models), and a six-speed transmission (for the &#x27;87–&#x27;92 models). It was a machine exclusively designed for racing by highly skilled riders.

Honda responded a year later with the FourTrax TRX250R—a machine that has not been replicated until recently. It currently remains a trophy winner and competitor to big-bore ATVs. Kawasaki responded with its Tecate-4 250. The TRX250R was very similar to the ATC250R it eventually replaced and is often considered one of the greatest sport ATVs ever built.

In 1987, Yamaha Motor Company introduced a different type of high-performance machine, the Banshee 350, which featured a twin-cylinder liquid-cooled two-stroke motor from the RD350LC street motorcycle. Heavier and more difficult to ride in the dirt than the 250s, the Banshee became a popular machine with sand dune riders thanks to its unique power delivery. The Banshee remains popular, but 2006 is the last year it was available in the U.S. (due to EPA emissions regulations); it remained available in Canada until 2008 and in Australia until 2012. The Warrior 350 was introduced in 1987 and went on for years as a light and fast ATV.

Shortly after the introduction of the Banshee in 1987, Suzuki released the LT500R QuadRacer. This unique quad was powered by a 500 cc liquid-cooled two-stroke engine with a five-speed transmission. This ATV earned the nickname &quot;Quadzilla&quot; with its remarkable amount of speed and size. While there are claims of 100+ mph () stock Quadzillas, it was officially recorded by 3&amp;4 Wheel Action magazine as reaching a top speed of over in a high-speed shootout in its 1988 June issue, making it the fastest production four-wheeled ATV ever produced. Suzuki discontinued the production of the LT500R in 1990 after just four years.

At the same time, the development of utility ATVs was rapidly escalating. The 1986 Honda FourTrax TRX350 4x4 ushered in the era of four-wheel-drive ATVs. Other manufacturers quickly followed suit, and 4x4s have remained the most popular type of ATV ever since. These machines are popular with hunters, farmers, ranchers, and workers at construction sites.

Models are divided into the sport and utility markets. Sport models are generally small, light, two-wheel-drive vehicles that accelerate quickly, have a manual transmission, and run at speeds up to approximately . Utility models are generally bigger four-wheel-drive vehicles with a maximum speed of up to approximately . They can haul small loads on attached racks or small dump beds, and tow small trailers. Due to the different weights, each has advantages on different types of terrain. A popular model is Yamaha&#x27;s Raptor 700, which has a nearly 700 cc four-stroke engine.

Six-wheel models often have a small dump bed, with an extra set of wheels at the back to increase the payload capacity. They can be either four-wheel-drive (back wheels driving only), or six-wheel-drive.

In 2011 LandFighter was founded, &quot;the first Dutch/European ATV brand&quot;. Most production is in Taiwan, to European standards; the ATVs are finally assembled in the Netherlands.

==Safety and legal regulation==
Safety helmets, mandatory in some jurisdictions, provide the rider with some protection in the case of an accident.

===Three-wheel vehicles===
Safety courses and educational literature reduced the number and severity of accidents among ATC and ATV riders. As cornering is more challenging on a three-wheel ATC than with a four-wheeled machine, properly leaning into the turn is required to counterbalance the weight and keep the machine stable. Careless operators may roll over at high speeds. The lighter front-end and smaller footprint of ATCs present both a flipping and steering hazard under acceleration and on inclines. Lateral rollovers may also occur when traversing steep inclines. ATCs require unique techniques to ride properly, and turning lean requires more exaggeration than ATVs; Throttle steering is another technique commonly used on ATCs in soft terrain and at high speeds, leaning to the inside of the turn and manipulating the throttle to break traction with the rear tires, resulting in the machines turning on axis while maintaining a forward direction.

===Four-wheel vehicles===

Four-wheel quad cycles have a tendency to roll over, often injuring or killing the rider. Suitably designed roll bars can be fitted, which do not prevent the cycle from overturning, but prop it up, providing some protection for the rider.

===Studies and protective equipment===

Safety has been a major issue with ATVs due to the many deaths and injuries associated with them and the lack of protection due to the absence of a rigid cab.

Modern ATVs were introduced in the early 1970s, with almost immediate alarming injury rates for children and adolescents. Based on analysis of the National Trauma Data Bank, ATVs are more dangerous than dirt bikes, possibly due to crush injuries and failure to wear safety gear such as helmets. They are as dangerous as motorcycles, based on mortality and injury scores. More children and women, who are less likely to wear helmets, are injured on ATVs.

Many common injuries can be prevented with the use of proper protective equipment. Most ATV manufacturers recommend at least a suitable DOT-approved helmet, protective eyewear, gloves and suitable riding boots for all riding conditions. Sport or aggressive riders, or riders on challenging terrain (such as those rock crawling or hillclimbing), may opt for a motocross-style chest protector and knee/shin guards for further protection. Use of tires suited to a particular terrain can also play a vital role in preventing injuries. Fatal accidents typically occur when the vehicle rolls over. Wearing a helmet can reduce the risk of death by 42% and the risk of nonfatal head injury by 64%.

===United States===
In the United States, statistics released by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) show that in 2016-2020, an estimated 526,900 emergency department treated injuries were associated with off-highway vehicles (an annual average of 105,400), and up to half of these injuries involved children and youth under age 25. From 2016-2018, 1591 people died in ATV-associated incidents, with 28% involving children and youth under age 25. Focus has shifted to machine size balanced with the usage of ATVs categorized by age ranges and engine displacements—in line with the consent decrees. ATVs are mandated to bear a label from the manufacturer stating that the use of machines greater than 90 cc by riders under the age of 12 is prohibited. This is a &#x27;manufacturer/CPSC recommendation&#x27; and not necessarily state law.

The American Academy of Pediatrics and the CPSC recommended that children under the age of 16 should not ride ATVs. In the United States, about 40,000 children under age 16 are treated in emergency departments for ATV-related injuries each year. A Canadian study stated that &quot;associated injury patterns, severity, and costs to the healthcare system&quot; of pediatric injuries associated to ATVs resemble those caused by motor vehicles, and that public policies should reflect this. Helmets are underutilized and result in Glasgow Coma Scale scores in children presenting from ATV accidents being similar to those in motorcycle accidents.

The Consumer Product Safety Commission met in March 2005 to discuss the dangers of ATVs. Data from 2004 showed 44,000 injuries and almost 150 fatalities in children while riding ATVs. In response to calls for further regulation, the CPSC&#x27;s director of compliance, John Gibson Mullan, said that because the statistics were not rising, existing measures were working. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported an accusation from a staff member that Mullan, who had previously worked as a lawyer for the ATV industry, had distorted the statistics and prevented further debate.

The United States government maintains a website about the safety of ATVs where safety tips are provided, such as not driving ATVs with a passenger (passengers make it difficult or impossible for the driver to shift their weight, as required to drive an ATV) or not driving ATVs on paved roads (ATVs usually have a solid rear axle with no differential).

In 1988, the All-terrain Vehicle Safety Institute (ASI) was formed to provide training and education for ATV riders. The cost of attending the training is minimal and is free for purchasers of new machines that fall within the correct age and size guidelines. Successful completion of a safety training class is, in many states, a minimum requirement for minors to be granted permission to ride on public land. Some states have had to implement their own safety training programs, as the ASI program cannot include those riders with ATVs outside of the age and size guidelines, which may still fall within the states&#x27; laws.

From January 1, 2019, the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission updated ATV lighting requirements, requiring all categories of ATVs to be equipped with a stop lamp and side reflectors similar to those required on passenger cars.

In industry, agriculture workers are disproportionately at risk for ATV accidents. Most fatalities occur in white men over the age of 55.

====Street legality====

ATV&#x27;s have the ability to be officially street legal and can be used on at least certain roads in 21 states, requirements vary by state however.

===United Kingdom===
A &quot;quad&quot; is recognised by UK law as a vehicle with four wheels and a mass of less than . A quad cycle to be used on a public road in the UK must be taxed, insured and registered, and the driver must have a category B (car) or B1 (motor vehicles with 4 wheels up to 400 kg unladen or 550 kg if designed for carrying goods) licence.
In the United Kingdom, the safety issues of cars classed as quad cycles are illustrated by the case of the G-Wiz (REVAi). The electric microcar was given a Euro NCAP specification test, and the results showed that the vehicle&#x27;s occupants would suffer &quot;serious or life-threatening&quot; injuries in a crash.
The UK Department for Transport concluded that there were serious safety concerns when the REVA was crashed at .

===Australia===
After consultation with stakeholders including farmers and quad cycle manufacturers, Australia&#x27;s Heads of Workplace Safety Authorities (HWSA) in 2011 released a strategy intended to reduce the number of deaths and serious injuries associated with quad-bike use. The development of the report was closely followed by &quot;The Weekly Times&quot; newspaper and ABC television which reviewed the issue through its &quot;7.30&quot; program. Apart from encouraging of standard safety measures such as helmet-wearing, the strategy also recommend development of a national training curriculum, point of sale material for purchasers and, controversially, a recommendation that owners consider fitting an after-market anti-crush device which may offer added protection in the event of a roll-over.

When the report was released the only model of anti-crush protection on the market was the Australian-made &quot;Quadbar&quot;, which was vigorously opposed by the industry through media activity and a poster campaign at regional events for farmers which are often used to showcase new products. The industry argued that the device had not been properly tested and that past studies of tractor-style ROPS such as a full-frame &#x27;cage&#x27; around the operator were not only ineffective, but could add to the risk to injury or death.

In February 2012, the Melbourne-based Institute for Safety, Compensation and Recovery Research (ISCRR) published a paper which criticised the research claims of the manufacturers in relation to crush protection devices. The paper reviewed research in a number of countries since 1993 in relation to rollover protection and found that the industry&#x27;s opposition to rollover protection could not be supported because of limitations in past research. It recommended further research on the topic and the development of research tools based on the use of ATV/quadbikes in Australian conditions.

===Canada===
In most provinces, ATV users are required to register their vehicle and have a designated off-highway license plate. Some provinces, like Nova Scotia, recently moved to allow ATVs limited road shoulder usage for the purpose of travelling from one trailhead to another.

===Germany===
In Germany the legal situation is very unrestrictive, but complex.

====Street legality and registration====
Almost, if not any manufacturer ATV registered at the KBA (Kraftfahrtbundesamt) can be registered for road use in Germany. Vehicle-taxes, insurance and a number plate as well as a MOT (TÜV) are required.

Quads can be accredited in two different ways in Germany. Usually they are taxed and insured as a regular automobile, which results in the tax being calculated by emissions and displacement in 100ccm steps. ATVs registered as an automobile have to be restricted to a power output of 20 hp/15 kW and are allowed to be driven with a passenger, provided a passenger seat is registered in the vehicle papers.

The quad must have at least one rear mirror on the left side, minimum 10x5cm. Right side mirror is optional.

The vehicle must have a high-/low-beam headlight, brake light, indicators, a number plate mount on front and back, and a horn.

ATVs under do not need a reverse gear. Over empty weight, a reverse gear and reverse light are required.

The maximum engine noise restrictions depend on date of first registration and engine displacement.

On the other hand, ATVs can be registered &quot;as agricultural and silvicultural&quot; (LoF/Land- oder Forstwirtschaftlich) giving the owner some benefits: The quad can be driven with power outputs more than 20 hp and tax is much cheaper, being calculated by empty weight. The insurance cost is much lower than for other agricultural vehicles and ATVs.

However, there are some restrictions and requirements for registering ATVS as an agricultural vehicle:
* the ATV may never be driven with a passenger, even if a passenger seat is available.
* in addition to the street registration requirements, it needs:
** additional hazard flashers
** a rear fog light
** a minimum of 2 headlights
** a trailer coupling including electric kit for trailer lighting.
** a reverse gear, even under 400 kg empty weight

====Customization====
Custom builds and engine replacements are possible to get street legal, by undergoing a single-acceptance procedure from the MOT(TÜV). This results in some custom quads popularly sporting 4-cycle motorcycle engines street legal. A common example are Yamaha Raptor 700 Conversions to a Yamaha 1000 cc engine from the early Yamaha Fazer and R1.

====Driving license====
ATVS are mostly treated as a regular automobile in Germany, which means no special-vehicle or motorcycle licence is needed. The regular driving license class B (multiple track motorised vehicles up to 3.5 tons) is sufficient even for LoF registered vehicles. Consequently, until 2013, quads could be driven only by people at least 18 years old with a drivers license. People under 18 may have a 50 cc or 125 cc bike license, but this does not allow them to drive quad bikes.

In 2013 the class AM licence was introduced, allowing 16-year-olds to drive microcars that do not exceed a speed of 50 km/h (such as the infamous Ellenator); this permits the use of an ATV limited to 50 cc with a top speed not exceeding 45 km/h

====Special restrictions====
As quad bikes were treated as automobiles, wearing a helmet was not required until January 2006, when helmets became required for ATVs, three-wheelers, trikes, etc. No additional protective gear is required.

Officially, driving a quad requires the owner to always carry a hazard triangle and a first-aid kit, and a reflective vest if the quad is registered as an agricultural vehicle. Due to the lack of storage room, police usually don&#x27;t check the back of the vehicle, but if they lack the required equipment, they may be prosecuted.

==Environmental issues==
===Emissions===
ATVs accounted for 58% of the SI (spark ignited) recreational vehicles in the US in the year 2000. That year, recreational SI vehicles produced 0.16% of NOx, 8% of HC, 5% of CO and 0.8% of PM emissions for all vehicles, both highway and nonroad. As a point of comparison, the nonroad SI &lt; 19 kW (~25 hp) category (small spark ignition engines such as lawnmowers) comprised 20% of HC and 23% of CO total emissions. While recreational SI vehicles produce an aggregate of &lt;4% of all HC emissions in the US, based on the relatively small population of ATVs (&lt;1.2M) and small annual usage (&lt;350 hrs), EPA emission regulations now include such engines, starting with the model year 2006. Engines meeting these standards now produce only 3% of the HC emissions that previously unregulated engines did.

===Terrain damage===

While the deep treads on some ATV tires are effective for navigating rocky, muddy and root covered terrain, these treads are also capable of digging channels that may drain bogs, increase sedimentation in streams at crossings and damage groomed snowmobile trails. Proper trail construction techniques can mitigate these effects.

In some countries where fencing is not common, such as the US, Canada and Australia, some ATV riders knowingly cross privately owned property in rural areas and travel over public or private properties, although only permitted on trails. Subsequently, environmentalists criticize ATV riding as a sport for excessive use in areas which biologists consider to be sensitive, especially wetlands and sand dunes and in much of inland Australia.

Because both scientific studies and U.S. National Forest Service personnel have identified unregulated Off-Road Vehicles (ORVs) as the source of major detrimental impacts on national forests, the U.S. Forest Service is currently engaged in the Travel Management Process, wherein individual forests are restricting all off-road motorized travel to approved trails and roads. This is in contrast to its previously allowed, unregulated cross-country travel across all national forest lands, except for specifically designated wilderness areas. Although ORVs had been identified 30 years ago as a threat to wild ecosystems by the Forest Service, only after pressure by an unlikely alliance of environmentalists, private landowners, hunters, ranchers, fishermen, quiet recreationists and forest rangers themselves (who identified ORVs as a &quot;significant law enforcement problem&quot; in national forests). has action been taken.

==Other uses==
ATVs using tracks instead of wheels are used at France&#x27;s Cap Prudhomme in Antarctica.

ATVs are also used in agriculture to bridge the advantages of trucks and tractors.

They are used in a variety of industries for their maneuverability and off-roading ability. These include:
* Border control
* construction
* emergency medical services
* land management
* law enforcement
* military
* mineral exploration
* oil exploration
* pipeline transport
* search and rescue
* forestry
* surveying
* wild land fire control

==Sport competition==
Sport models are built with performance, rather than utility, in mind. To be successful at fast trail riding, an ATV must have light weight, high power, good suspension and a low center of gravity. These machines can be modified for such racing disciplines as motocross, woods racing (also known as cross country), desert racing (also known as Hare Scrambles), hill climbing, ice racing, speedway, Tourist Trophy (TT), flat track, drag racing and others.

Throughout the United States and the United Kingdom there are many quad racing clubs with enduro and quadcross sections. GNCC Racing began around 1980 and includes hare scramble and enduro type races. To date, events are mainly held in the eastern part of the United States. GNCC racing features many types of obstacles such as, hill climbing, creek and log crossings, dirt roads and wooded trails.

ATV National Motocross Championship was formed around 1985. ATVMX events are hosted at premiere motocross racetracks throughout the United States. ATVMX consists of several groups, including the Pro (AMA Pro) and Amateur (ATVA) series. Friday involves amateur practicing and racing on Saturday and Sunday. Saturday also involves racing for the Pro Am Women and Pro Am Unlimited classes. Sunday involves racing for the Pro and Pro Am production ATVs, but are scored separately. On average weekend over 500 racers will compete.

The FIM organizes the Quadcross of Nations at the end of the year. The competition involves teams of three riders representing their nations. There are three motos with two riders of each nation competing per moto. The location of the event changes from year to year.

Championship Mud Racing/CMR saw its infancy in 2006 as leaders of the ATV industry recognized a need for uniformity of classes and rules of various local mud bog events. Providing standardized rules created the need for a governing body that both racers and event promoters could turn to and CMR was born. Once unified, a true points series was established and lead to a national championship for what was once nothing more than a hobby for most. In 2007 the finalized board of directors was established and the first races were held in 2008. Currently, the CMR schedule includes eight competition dates spanning from March to November. Points are awarded throughout the season in several different competition classes of ATV and SxS Mud Racing. The 2008 year included Mud Bog and Mudda-Cross competitions, but the 2009 and future seasons will only have Mudda-Cross competitions. Classes range from 0–499 cc to a Super-Modified class which will allow any size ATV in competition. The ultimate goal of The CMR is &quot;to see the growth of ATV Mud Racing as a competitive sport and give competitors a pedestal upon which they can receive the recognition from national media and industry sponsors that they have long deserved.&quot;

In 2005 the FIM Cross-Country Rallies World Championship started with a Quad Championship and the Dakar Rally added the Quad category in 2008. Because the 2008 Dakar Rally was cancelled, the 2009 Dakar Rally was the first Dakar Rally with Quads.

Amateur and professional three-wheeler racing across the United States has also spiked in popularity once again, at levels not seen since the factory teams raced in the 1980s. Part of the appeal is the cheapness of parts, and how easy it is to get into. Races are held at various local and large venues, particularly in Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Michigan and California. Payouts are sometimes awarded to winners.

Each year in June, the world&#x27;s biggest three-wheeler gathering is held at Haspin Acres, in Laurel, Indiana, for the Trikefest event. Over the course of 3 days complete with camping, hundreds of people gather for the event which features competitive racing such as MX style racing, drag racing, mud racing, hill climbs and other events. For those who wish not to compete, there are also many trails a person can ride. as many as 100 or more three-wheelers show up each year, some built and restored to be raffled off, others brought to ride.

The fastest speed recorded on a quad cycle, or ATV given a flying start, is 315.74 km/h (196.19 mph), by Terry Wilmeth (USA), at the Madras Airport in Madras, Oregon, USA, on 15 June 2008.

<doc id="338340" wikidata="Q1783560" url="?curid=338340" title="Spithead">
<text>Spithead is an eastern area of the Solent and a roadstead for vessels off Gilkicker Point in Hampshire, England. It is protected from all winds except those from the southeast, with the Isle of Wight lying to the south-west. Spithead and the channel to the north is the main approach for shipping to Portsmouth Harbour and onwards to Southampton. Spithead itself is an important naval anchorage. Historically, Spithead was used for assembling Royal Navy ships, including as a formation area for squadrons or fleets at anchor, as well as for the resupply of ships.

==Geography==

It receives its name from the Spit, a sandbank stretching south from the Hampshire shore for . Spithead is long by about in average breadth. Horse and Dean Sand lie to the NE side and Ryde Sand and No Man&#x27;s Land to the South side.

As of 2004, the main channel was reported as being maintained at a dredged depth of 9.5m.

==History==

There are evidence of submerged prehistoric landscapes at Spithead.

The Spithead mutiny occurred in 1797 in some of the ship of the Royal Navy Channel fleet which were at anchor at Spithead.

On 19 July 1545, Mary Rose sank off Spithead. Spithead was the location where sank in 1782 with the loss of more than 800 lives.

In 1836, the artist Clarkson Frederick Stanfield described Spithead as &quot;marked out by buoys at regular intervals, and is often the spot chosen for the assembling of the English fleet. The port is the general rendezvous where all ships homeward or outward bound take convoy, and frequently seven hundred merchantmen have sailed at one time from Spithead.&quot;

The Fleet Review is a British tradition that usually takes place at Spithead, where the monarch reviews the massed Royal Navy. The 1937 Coronation Fleet Review and 1953 coronation reviews were two of the largest assembly of warships in history, described by military historian Hedley Paul Willmott as &quot;the last parade of the Royal Navy as the world&#x27;s greatest and most prodigious navy&quot;.

In July 2007, Admiral Alan West, a former First Sea Lord took the name Spithead when he was appointed to the House of Lords, taking the title Baron West of Spithead.

==Infrastructure==

Spithead has been strongly defended by four Solent Forts, which complement the Fortifications of Portsmouth. The forts were begun in 1865 under Lord Palmerston and completed by 1880.

At the eastern end of the approaches to Spithead lies Nab Tower, which is sunk in place over rocks and replaced an earlier light vessel.

In 2016, several new navigational lights on posts were installed by pile foundation into the seabed at Spithead to be used by the Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers.

==In popular culture==
In the operetta &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; by Gilbert and Sullivan, the character &quot;Buttercup&quot; is referred to as &quot;The rosiest, roundest, and reddest beauty in all Spithead&quot;.

In the book series about the naval officer Horatio Hornblower by C. S. Forester, the main protagonist starts off his career by becoming seasick in calm weather on Spithead.

<text>Synovus Financial Corp., formerly the Columbus Bank and Trust Company, is an American financial services company with approximately $62 billion in assets based in Columbus, Georgia. Synovus provides commercial and retail banking, investment, and mortgage services through 249 branches and 335 ATMs in Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, Florida, and Tennessee.

==Company history==
The bank opened in 1888 following an incident at a textile mill in which a worker&#x27;s dress became entangled in machinery, spilling the money she had sewn into her hem onto the floor. After she explained to a factory executive that she had felt this was the safest place to keep her savings, he offered instead to secure her money in the mill safe and pay her interest on her balance. This service was soon offered to all company employees.

Synovus&#x27;s founding parent company, Columbus Bank and Trust (CB&amp;T), has deep roots in its hometown. CB&amp;T started TSYS in 1959 and in 1974 the company began processing credit cards for other banks. In 1983, CB&amp;T made TSYS a separate publicly traded company, retaining majority ownership. On October 25, 2007, TSYS and Synovus (holding 81% of shares at the time) announced a spin-off that was completed as of the end of 2007.[4] Synovus took its current name in 2010.

In 2009 the bank was listed as one of more than 150 United States lenders that owned nonperforming loans equal in value to five percent or more of their holdings, exceeding a threshold said to threaten its survival. Synovus subsequently laid off 850 employees and closed many branches in early 2011. In July 2013, Synovus repaid $967.9 million borrowed under the Troubled Asset Relief Program.

===Synovus Branding===
In early 2010, Synovus consolidated thirty separate state bank charters into one Georgia charter and began the transition toward operating as a more centralized bank. Beginning in late 2017 and ending in mid-2018, the company transitioned from 28 locally-branded divisions to a single Synovus brand.

===Acquisition of Florida Community Bank===
In January 2019, Synovus completed a $2.9 billion acquisition of FCB Financial Holdings, Inc., owner of Florida Community Bank. Branding to Synovus was expected during the second quarter of 2019.

<doc id="338344" wikidata="Q1779466" url="?curid=338344" title="List of tallest buildings">
<text>This is a list of the tallest buildings. Tall buildings, such as skyscrapers, are intended here as enclosed structures with continuously occupiable floors and a height of at least . Such definition excludes non-building structures, such as towers.

== History ==

Historically, the world&#x27;s tallest man-made structure was the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt, which held the position for over 3,800 years until the construction of Lincoln Cathedral in 1311. The Strasbourg Cathedral in France, completed in 1439, was the world&#x27;s tallest building until 1874.

The first building considered to be a skyscraper was the Home Insurance Building, built in Chicago in 1885. The United States would remain the location of the world&#x27;s tallest building throughout the 20th century until 1998, when the Petronas Towers were completed. Since then, two other buildings have gained the title: Taipei 101 in 2004 and Burj Khalifa in 2010. Since the beginning of the 21st century, the Middle East, China, and Southeast Asia have experienced booms in skyscraper construction.

== Ranking criteria and alternatives ==
The international non-profit organization Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) was formed in 1969 and announces the title of &quot;The World&#x27;s Tallest Building&quot; and sets the standards by which buildings are measured. It maintains a list of the 100 tallest completed buildings in the world. The organization currently ranks Burj Khalifa in Dubai as the tallest at . However, the CTBUH only recognizes buildings that are complete, and some buildings included within the lists in this article are not considered finished by the CTBUH.

In 1996, as a response to the dispute as to whether the Petronas Towers or the Sears Tower was taller, the council listed and ranked buildings in four categories:
* height to structural or architectural top;
* height to highest occupied floor;
* height to top of roof (removed as category in November 2009); and
* height to top of any part of the building.
All categories measure the building from the level of the lowest significant open-air pedestrian entrance.

Spires are considered integral parts of the architectural design of buildings, changes to which would substantially change the appearance and design of the building, whereas antennas may be added or removed without such consequences. The Petronas Towers, with their spires, are thus ranked higher than the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower) with its antennas, despite the Petronas Towers&#x27; lower roofs and lower highest point.

Until 1996, the world&#x27;s tallest building was defined by the height to the top of the tallest architectural element, including spires but not antennae. In 1930, this definitional argument led to a rivalry between the Bank of Manhattan Building and the Chrysler Building. The Bank of Manhattan Building (i.e. 40 Wall Street) employed only a short spire, was tall, and had a much higher top occupied floor (the second category in the 1996 criteria for tallest building). In contrast, the Chrysler Building employed a very large spire secretly assembled inside the building to claim the title of world&#x27;s tallest building with a total height of , although it had a lower top occupied floor and a shorter height when both buildings&#x27; spires were excluded.

Upset by Chrysler&#x27;s victory, Shreve &amp; Lamb, the consulting architects of the Bank of Manhattan Building, wrote a newspaper article claiming that their building was actually the tallest, since it contained the world&#x27;s highest usable floor, at . They pointed out that the observation deck in the Bank of Manhattan Building was nearly above the top floor in the Chrysler Building, whose surpassing spire was strictly ornamental and inaccessible.

The Burj Khalifa currently tops the list regardless of which criterion is applied, though at a much lower margin when measured to highest occupied floor.

== Tallest buildings in the world ==

As of , this list includes all 95 buildings (completed and architecturally topped out) that reach a height of or more, as assessed by their highest architectural feature. The building is considered as architecturally topped out when it is under construction, structurally topped out, fully clad, and the highest finished architectural elements are in place.

Of these buildings, almost half are in China. Six of the last seven buildings to have held the record as &#x27;tallest building&#x27; are still found in the list, with the exception being the North Tower of the original World Trade Center at after its destruction in the September 11 attacks of 2001. Had the Twin Towers never been destroyed and One World Trade Center never built, the WTC towers would rank 36 and 37 on the list today.

== Alternative measurements ==
=== Height to pinnacle (highest point) ===

This measurement disregards distinctions between architectural and non-architectural extensions, and simply measures to the highest point, irrespective of material or function of the highest element.

This measurement is useful for air traffic obstacle determinations, and is also a wholly objective measure. However, this measurement includes extensions that are easily added, removed, and modified from a building and are independent of the overall structure.

This measurement only recently came into use, when the Petronas Towers passed the Sears Tower (now named Willis Tower) in height. The former was considered taller because its spires were considered architectural, while the latter&#x27;s antennae were not. This led to the split of definitions, with the Sears Tower claiming the lead in this and the height-to-roof (now highest occupied floor) categories, and with the Petronas claiming the lead in the architectural height category.

If the World Trade Center towers were still standing, the North () and South Towers () would fall between numbers 35 and 36 on the current list (as it can be assumed the rebuilt One World Trade Center would have never been built).


=== Height to occupied floor ===

This height is measured to the highest occupiable floor within the building.

===Height to roof===
This list of tallest buildings by height to roof ranks completed skyscrapers by height to roof which reach a height of 300 metres (984 ft) or more. Only buildings with continuously occupiable floors are included, thus non-building structures, including towers, are not included. Some assessments of the tallest building use &#x27;height to roof&#x27; to determine tallest building, as &#x27;architectural feature&#x27; is regarded as a subjective and an imprecise comparative measure. However, in November 2009, the CTBUH stopped using the roof height as the metric for tall buildings because modern tall buildings rarely have a part of the building that can categorically be deemed the roof.

== Buildings under construction ==
This is a list of buildings taller than that are currently under construction. On-hold buildings whose construction was interrupted after it had reached a significantly advanced state are listed in a separate table.

<doc id="338350" wikidata="Q233959" url="?curid=338350" title="Belinda Carlisle">
<text>Belinda Jo Carlisle ( ; born August 17, 1958) is an American singer and songwriter. She gained fame as the lead vocalist of the Go-Go&#x27;s, one of the most successful all-female rock bands of all time, and went on to have a prolific career as a solo artist.

Raised in Southern California, Carlisle was the lead vocalist of the Go-Go&#x27;s, which she co-founded in 1978. With their chart-topping debut studio album &quot;Beauty and the Beat&quot; in 1981, the group helped popularize new wave music in the United States. The Go-Go&#x27;s have sold over seven million records worldwide.

After the break-up of the Go-Go&#x27;s in 1985, Carlisle went on to have a successful solo career with radio hits such as &quot;Mad About You&quot;, &quot;I Get Weak&quot;, &quot;Circle in the Sand&quot;, &quot;Leave a Light On&quot;, &quot;Summer Rain&quot;, and &quot;Heaven Is a Place on Earth&quot;. The Go-Go&#x27;s reformed in 1999, and Carlisle performed with them until their disbandment in 2022, while also maintaining her solo career.

Carlisle&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Lips Unsealed&quot;, published in June 2010, was a &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller and received favorable reviews. In 1999, Carlisle was ranked No. 76 with the Go-Go&#x27;s in VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Women of Rock &amp; Roll.&quot; In 2011, Carlisle, as a member of the Go-Go&#x27;s, received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She and the band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2021, and the California Hall of Fame in 2024.

==Early life and education==

Belinda Jo Carlisle was born in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, on August 17, 1958, to Harold Carlisle, a gas station employee, and his wife, Joanne (née Thompson), a homemaker. Her mother met her father, who was 20 years her senior, at age 18, and Carlisle was born nine months later. She was named after her mother&#x27;s favorite film, &quot;Johnny Belinda&quot; (1948). Carlisle was the first of seven siblings; she has three brothers and three sisters. When she was five years old, Carlisle&#x27;s father abandoned their family, and she has stated that she spent most of her childhood impoverished. As a teenager, she recalled owning &quot;like, two outfits.&quot; According to Carlisle, her mother was very religious, while her father was not. In an interview with &quot;Slash&quot; magazine, she described herself as a reject from a Southern Baptist household.

Her mother later married Walt Kurczeski, who Carlisle says was an alcoholic, and with whom she had a tumultuous relationship. She took on his last name during her high school years. The family moved frequently during her childhood, from Simi Valley to Reseda, before settling in Burbank when Carlisle was seven years old. At age ten, Carlisle began to express interest in music, and recalled the Beach Boys, Cat Stevens, the Stylistics, and the Animals as being early musical influences.

The family relocated again during Carlisle&#x27;s adolescence, this time to Thousand Oaks, California; she attended Colina Junior High School in Thousand Oaks, where she was a 3rd-string guard on the boys&#x27; basketball team, and later Newbury Park High School, where she was a cheerleader. During her teenage years, Carlisle became rebellious: &quot;By the time I hit fourteen, I&#x27;d gone really wild,&quot; she said. &quot;I ran away from home, smoked pot, dropped acid ... you name it, I&#x27;d try it.&quot; After high school, Carlisle worked at a House of Fabrics store, and as a photocopier clerk at the Hilton Hotels Corporation in Los Angeles at age 18. She took night classes attending beauty college, but dropped out in the first year. At the age of 19, Carlisle left home to pursue a career in music.

==Career==
===Early ventures and the Go-Go&#x27;s===
Carlisle&#x27;s first venture into music was in 1977 as drummer for the punk rock band the Germs, under the name Dottie Danger. She was recruited into the band by Lorna Doom, whom she had met in an art class while a student at Newbury Park High School. However, her time in the band was short owing to her contracting mononucleosis, and she never recorded or performed live with the Germs. According to Germs guitarist Pat Smear, upon quitting, she introduced her friend, Donna Rhia, who became her replacement. Carlisle does appear on one recording introducing the band at a 1977 performance at the Whisky a Go Go, heard on the live album &quot;Germicide&quot; (1977). Around this time, Carlisle provided some backing vocals for Black Randy and the Metrosquad.

Soon after leaving the Germs, she co-founded the Go-Go&#x27;s (originally named the Misfits) with friends and fellow musicians Margot Olavarria, Elissa Bello, and Jane Wiedlin. Olavarria and Bello were soon out of the group, and the new line-up included Carlisle, Wiedlin, bassist-turned-guitarist Charlotte Caffey, guitarist-turned-bassist Kathy Valentine, and drummer Gina Schock. All five women were largely untrained musicians, and Carlisle recalls having to use tape as fret markers during their initial songwriting: &quot;[Charlotte] had to show us how to plug in our amps,&quot; she said.

The Go-Go&#x27;s went on to become one of the most successful American bands of the 1980s, helping usher new wave music into popular American radio, and becoming the first and only all-female band that wrote their own music and played their own instruments to ever achieve a No. 1 album, &quot;Beauty and the Beat&quot; (1981), which featured the hits &quot;We Got the Beat&quot; and &quot;Our Lips Are Sealed&quot;. The Go-Go&#x27;s recorded two more studio albums on I.R.S. Records, including 1982&#x27;s &quot;Vacation&quot;, which went gold. &quot;Head over Heels&quot;, from their 1984 album &quot;Talk Show&quot;, made it to No. 11. In 1984, Carlisle made a foray into acting in the movie &quot;Swing Shift&quot;, appearing as a band singer alongside Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell.

===Solo career===
====1985–1990====
The Go-Go&#x27;s broke up in 1985, and Carlisle embarked on a solo career. Carlisle&#x27;s debut solo studio album &quot;Belinda&quot; was released in 1986, also on I.R.S. Records. This album was successful in North America and was certified Gold in the United States and Platinum in Canada. Her summer hit &quot;Mad About You&quot; peaked at No. 3 in the United States, and charted in the Top 10 in Australia. &quot;Mad About You&quot; was followed by the Motown-influenced single &quot;I Feel the Magic&quot; written by Charlotte Caffey, and by a cover version of the Freda Payne song &quot;Band of Gold&quot;. All three songs were included on her debut studio album. The single &quot;Since You&#x27;ve Gone&quot;, co-written by Lindsey Buckingham of Fleetwood Mac, was used only for promotion. Susanna Hoffs co-wrote the single &quot;I Need a Disguise&quot; in which she also sang backing vocals along with Jane Wiedlin. Duran Duran&#x27;s Andy Taylor played guitar on some album tracks and appeared in her &quot;Mad About You&quot; music video. During this time, Carlisle also had songs featured on movie soundtracks, notably &quot;In My Wildest Dreams&quot; from the movie &quot;Mannequin&quot; (1987), &quot;Shot in the Dark&quot; from the Anthony Michael Hall thriller &quot;Out of Bounds&quot; (1986), as well as &quot;Dancing in the City&quot; from the Whoopi Goldberg movie &quot;Burglar&quot; (1987).

The musical style of 1987&#x27;s &quot;Heaven on Earth&quot; eschewed the 1960s-influenced pop of Carlisle&#x27;s debut studio album in favor of slickly produced 1980s power pop. It was released in the United States through MCA, and in the United Kingdom through Virgin Records. The album became a Top 5 bestseller in the UK and Australia, and was nominated for a Grammy Award. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Heaven Is a Place on Earth&quot;, topped the single charts in the United States and the UK, with the dance mix of the song also topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; dance chart in the US. The promotional video was directed by Academy Award–winning American actress Diane Keaton. The second single from the album was the Diane Warren–penned &quot;I Get Weak&quot;, which peaked at No. 2 in the United States and No. 10 in the UK. The third single from the album was &quot;Circle in the Sand&quot;, another Top 10 hit in the United States, the UK, and Germany. &quot;World Without You&quot; was another British hit. Following the success of the album, Carlisle embarked on the &quot;Good Heavens&quot; world tour, which sold out Wembley Arena in London.

Carlisle&#x27;s follow-up to the success of &quot;Heaven on Earth&quot; was &quot;Runaway Horses&quot;, released on October 23, 1989. The album hit the Top 5 in both Australia and the UK, certified double platinum in Australia and platinum in the UK and in Canada. The first release, &quot;Leave a Light On&quot;, peaked at No. 11 in the United States, and became another Top 5 smash in the UK, Australia and Canada. That year, Carlisle also performed co-lead vocals with the Smithereens in a duet with the band&#x27;s lead vocalist Pat DiNizio on the song &quot;Blue Period&quot;. The song was featured on their third studio album &quot;11&quot;.

The second American single, &quot;Summer Rain&quot;, reached No. 30 in early 1990. The song reached No. 6 in Australia. It was the final release from &quot;Runaway Horses&quot; in the UK where it was released as the album&#x27;s sixth single in December 1990, peaking at No. 23 in January 1991. Three further singles were released: the title track; &quot;La Luna&quot;, which reached the Top 10 in Switzerland and Top 20 hit in Germany and Australia; and &quot;(We Want) The Same Thing&quot;, which reached No. 6 in the UK.

In the late autumn of 1990, the Go-Go&#x27;s reunited for a tour to support their first greatest hits album, &quot;Greatest&quot;, including a new recording of the cover song &quot;Cool Jerk&quot; (The Go-Go&#x27;s original cover was featured on their 1980 European EP, with a second version being released in 1982). A notable feature of the tour was an anti-fur campaign, where the band members supported the animal rights organization PETA.

====1991–1999====
In 1991, Carlisle released her fourth solo studio album, &quot;Live Your Life Be Free&quot;. The album marked somewhat of a return to 1960s-influenced music for Carlisle and included songs mainly written and produced by Rick Nowels but also two songs co-written by Carlisle. The single &quot;Do You Feel Like I Feel?&quot; was accompanied by a music video inspired by the B movie &quot;Attack of the 50 Foot Woman&quot; (1958). The title track, &quot;Live Your Life Be Free&quot;, released as first single outside the United States, was a Top 20 hit single in many countries reaching No. 12 in the UK and No. 13 in Australia. Subsequent releases &quot;Half the World&quot; and &quot;Little Black Book&quot; (co-written by Marcella Detroit under her real name Marcy Levy) were also hits outside the United States. The album was also a success in Europe (Top 10 in the UK and Gold certification). &quot;Do You Feel Like I Feel?&quot; is Carlisle&#x27;s final single to enter in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, peaking at No. 73.

Still active in Europe and Australia with a recording contract at Virgin Records, her 1992 greatest hits album &quot;The Best of Belinda, Volume 1&quot; reached No. 1, and was certified double platinum in the UK and platinum in Australia. Carlisle&#x27;s fifth solo studio album, &quot;Real&quot;, was released in 1993 on the Virgin label in the United States and in Europe. Produced without Nowels, the album was a departure from Carlisle&#x27;s polished pop music formula. Carlisle co-produced and co-wrote much of the album, collaborating heavily with friend and ex-Go-Go member Charlotte Caffey. The album was Carlisle&#x27;s fifth consecutive to reach the UK Top 10 peaking at No. 9. It also peaked at No. 23 in Sweden. Its lead single, &quot;Big Scary Animal&quot;, peaked at No. 12 in the UK. The second single from &quot;Real&quot; was &quot;Lay Down Your Arms&quot;, which made the Top 30 in the UK. Also in 1993, Carlisle provided guest vocals on the Lemonheads sixth studio album &quot;Come on Feel the Lemonheads&quot;, and appeared with Crash Baptists for their song &quot;One by One,&quot; on their soundtrack to the movie The Harvest.

The Go-Go&#x27;s reunited in 1994 to support the retrospective double-CD &quot;Return to the Valley of The Go-Go&#x27;s&quot;, their second collection, which featured three new songs, including the single &quot;The Whole World Lost Its Head&quot;. However, the band broke up again, soon after the promotional tour. Carlisle returned to the recording studio, and resumed working again with Rick Nowels. In 1996 she released in the UK and Australia her sixth solo studio album, &quot;A Woman &amp; a Man&quot;, on the Chrysalis label. This album, consisting of mostly relaxed adult pop, revitalized her solo career in Europe, and included several hits. The leadoff single, &quot;In Too Deep&quot;, returned Carlisle to the UK Top 10 for the first time in six years, reaching No. 6. &quot;Always Breaking My Heart&quot;, written and produced by Per Gessle of Roxette, also made the UK Top 10, peaking at No. 8.

The album spawned two further hits in the UK: &quot;Love in the Key of C&quot;, and &quot;California&quot;, which featured arrangement and backing vocals by Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys. The album reached No. 12 in the UK, and was certified gold. As a result of &quot;A Woman &amp; a Man&quot;″s UK success, the album was released in the United States during the summer of 1997 on the small Ark21 label. In 1997, she recorded &quot;I Won&#x27;t Say (I&#x27;m in Love)&quot; for the Disney movie &quot;Hercules&quot;.

In 1999, Carlisle released a greatest hits album in the UK, a double-disc on the Virgin label, collectively titled &quot;A Place on Earth: The Greatest Hits&quot;. The first disc featured Carlisle&#x27;s hits plus three new tracks recorded for the album: the single &quot;All God&#x27;s Children&quot;, and the songs &quot;A Prayer for Everyone&quot; and &quot;Feels Like I&#x27;ve Known You Forever&quot;. The second disc, subtitled &quot;A Place on Earth&quot;, contained previously released remixes of her hits and B-sides which had not previously been released. Despite being released only seven years after her previous greatest hits compilation, &quot;The Best of Belinda, Volume 1&quot;, the collection was a success in the UK where it made the Top 20 and was certified gold.

===Later recordings and Go-Go&#x27;s reunions===
====2001–2009====

In 2001, the Go-Go&#x27;s reunited again and released a studio album of new material, &quot;God Bless the Go-Go&#x27;s&quot;. Green Day&#x27;s lead vocalist Billie Joe Armstrong co-wrote the only released single &quot;Unforgiven&quot;. &quot;God Bless the Go-Go&#x27;s&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. Peter Fawthrop of AllMusic wrote &quot;Every bit as Go-Go&#x27;s, that is, as their non-hits and less remarkable material. While the Go-Go&#x27;s sound is intact, there is not a &quot;We Got the Beat&quot; or a &quot;Head Over Heels&quot; to be found. It is feasible that in this age of pop rebirth, the Go-Go&#x27;s decided it was now or never ... The album doesn&#x27;t attempt to update the band&#x27;s sound with hip-hop moves or electronic frippery, for which God should bless &#x27;em, indeed. The girls&#x27; hold on the current pop world remains so strong that Green Day&#x27;s Billie Joe Armstrong co-writes a song (&quot;Unforgiven&quot;) in impeccable Go-Go&#x27;s drag&quot;. In spite of the mixed reviews, the album charted in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at number No. 57. Around the time of the Go-Go&#x27;s definitive reunion tour, Carlisle appeared nude for the cover feature and a full pictorial of the August 2001 edition of &quot;Playboy&quot;.

In 2007, Carlisle released her seventh album, &quot;Voila&quot;, which was her first full-length solo studio album in more than ten years. The album was produced by John Reynolds and included Brian Eno on keyboards. Consisting of a mix of French pop tunes and chanson standards, including covers of Françoise Hardy and Édith Piaf classics, &quot;Voila&quot; was released via Rykodisc in the UK on February 5 and in the United States the following day, February 6, 2007. In early 2009, Carlisle was on the eighth season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, paired with Jonathan Roberts. She was the first star to be eliminated from the competition, on March 17. In October 2009, Carlisle took over the role of Velma Von Tussle in London&#x27;s West End production of &quot;Hairspray&quot; at the Shaftesbury Theatre. She remained with the show until late January 2010 and was replaced by Siobhán McCarthy.

====2010–2020====

Between 2011 and 2012, Carlisle embarked on a United States tour with the Go-Go&#x27;s, which included concerts at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles in August 2011 and the Hollywood Bowl in September 2012. In March 2013, Carlisle released her first US single in seventeen years titled &quot;Sun&quot;, an up-tempo pop song, which was included on &quot;ICON – The Best of Belinda Carlisle&quot;, a new greatest hits compilation album. The single was also released in the United Kingdom. The song was written by Carlisle, Jane Wiedlin of the Go-Go&#x27;s and singer-songwriter Gabe Lopez. Lopez also produced the song. While the track did not chart, it received positive reviews.

In August 2013, Edsel Records released remastered, three-disc versions of &quot;Heaven on Earth&quot;, &quot;Runaway Horses&quot;, &quot;Live Your Life Be Free&quot; and &quot;Real&quot;. Each album comprised a remastered version of the original LP followed by the 7-inch or radio edits of each single from that album, a second disc of remixes and 12-inch versions of all the singles, and a DVD comprising the promotional videos for the singles. Some of singles and remixes had never previously been released on CD. In March 2014, a new &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; titled &quot;The Collection&quot; was released containing 18 hits and one new song, &quot;Goodbye Just Go&quot;, along with a DVD of 18 videos. The album reached No. 24 in the UK albums chart.

Also in March 2014, another digitally remastered, five-disc retrospective collection titled &quot;Anthology&quot; was released. The anthology included &quot;Dancing in the City&quot;, which had previously only been available on the Japanese LP/CD for the soundtrack to the 1987 movie &quot;I Won&#x27;t Say I&#x27;m in Love&quot; which had previously only been released in 1997 as a CD single in France. It also included all three singles from her debut studio album and all four singles from &quot;A Woman &amp; a Man&quot;. Later in 2014, Carlisle&#x27;s three other studio albums, &quot;Belinda&quot;, &quot;A Woman &amp; a Man&quot; and &quot;Voila&quot; were re-issued by Edsel on CD, although there were a number of issues with their production.

Carlisle confirmed in a radio interview in August 2015 that she had completed work on a new studio album, earmarked for release in January 2016. She commented that the music on the album would be partly inspired by Kundalini yoga, which she had taken up while pregnant during 1991–1992 and of which she had qualified as a teacher since becoming sober in 2005. Also in August 2015, Edsel released a box set of all the commercially released singles from Carlisle&#x27;s studio albums, plus a bonus disc featuring a previously unreleased recording of &quot;In My Wildest Dreams&quot;, which had featured in the 1987 film &quot;Mannequin&quot;. In late 2016, the Go-Go&#x27;s completed an international tour with Best Coast as a supporting act, which Carlisle stated would likely be their last tour together. Carlisle&#x27;s eighth studio album, a selection of Gurmukhi chants titled &quot;Wilder Shores&quot;, was released in September 2017. Carlisle and the Go-Go&#x27;s announced an 11-date reunion tour scheduled to begin in June 2020. However, in May 2020 the tour was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

====2021–present: Musical comeback====

In May 2021, it was announced that the Go-Go&#x27;s would be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band performed &quot;Vacation&quot;, &quot;Our Lips Are Sealed&quot;, and &quot;We Got the Beat&quot; during the induction ceremony. Her ex-bandmate from the Germs, Pat Smear was also inducted on a same day as a member of Foo Fighters.

The band confirmed plans for a 2022 UK tour with Billy Idol that was supposed to start in June 2022 but was later scrapped due to Idol&#x27;s health and the Go-Go&#x27;s other commitments. The band was forced to postpone a short West Coast tour scheduled for the first week of January 2022 due to a COVID-19 case involving someone on the tour, saying that rescheduled dates for the shows would be announced. However, in 2023, Carlisle declared that the group had disbanded.

On March 16, 2023, Carlisle released &quot;Big Big Love&quot;, the first single from &quot;Kismet&quot;, a five track EP, penned by Diane Warren. The EP, released May 17, 2023, marks her first release of English-language pop music in twenty-seven years. It charted in several countries, marking a return to the charts for Carlisle. She also announced her intention to follow up on the release with a new English-language studio album, produced by Gabe Lopez. In February 2024, Carlisle and The Go-Go&#x27;s were inducted into the California Hall of Fame by the Governor of California, Gavin Newsom and his wife, First Partner Jennifer Siebel Newsom.

==Musical style and influences==

Carlisle has been noted by critics for her dynamic soprano vocal range. While Carlisle&#x27;s discography both with the Go-Go&#x27;s and in her solo work has been predominately characterized as pop music, some music scholars such as Greil Marcus have noted a confluence of subtle punk influences as well as pop rock, specifically in the Go-Go&#x27;s early releases (Marcus suggests that any traces of punk influence were carried over from Carlisle&#x27;s brief tenure in the Germs).

Carlisle has been alternately described by critics as a &quot;punk diva&quot; and &quot;pop princess&quot;. As a singer in the Go-Go&#x27;s, Carlisle was associated with the new wave genre, and the band was remarked by critics for their style that &quot;inject[ed] punk with the sound of California surf music.&quot; Her subsequent solo releases, beginning with her self-titled solo debut, &quot;Belinda&quot; (1986), were described by critics as more polished contemporary pop music.

Her early inspirations during her childhood were the Beach Boys, Cat Stevens, the Stylistics, and the Animals. As a teenager, she saw Iggy Pop on the cover of the Stooges&#x27; &quot;Raw Power&quot; (1973) in a record store, an album which she credited as a gateway exposing her to punk and art rock acts such as the Velvet Underground, New York Dolls, Roxy Music, and the Sex Pistols. In a 2013 interview, Carlisle stated that despite having recorded an abundance of it throughout her career, she &quot;didn&#x27;t really listen to pop music&quot;, and had recently been inspired by jazz artists such as Miles Davis.

==Personal life==
===Relationships and family===

Carlisle had a two-year relationship with Bill Bateman, drummer for the Blasters, in the early 1980s. She broke up abruptly with Bateman because she had taken up with Mike Marshall of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Her cocaine use was a negative influence on these relationships.

In 1986, Carlisle married political operative and film producer Morgan Mason, son of actor James Mason and actress Pamela Mason. He made appearances in Carlisle&#x27;s music videos &quot;Mad About You&quot; and &quot;Heaven Is a Place on Earth&quot;. They have one son, James Duke Mason, a prominent writer, activist and political commentator, who was born in 1992. After the 1994 Northridge earthquake, Carlisle and her family moved to Fréjus in south-eastern France. They lived between there and the U.S. In 2017, the couple moved to Bangkok, Thailand. As of 2024, they now reside in Mexico City, Mexico.

In a 1990 interview with &quot;Spin&quot;, Carlisle stated that she was not close with her siblings or parents, saying: &quot;I want to be close to them. I kind of feel uncomfortable. I think I feel guilty sometimes about my success in some ways.&quot;

===Health===
During the initial stages of her tenure with the Go-Go&#x27;s, Carlisle developed a serious addiction to cocaine and alcohol that went on to span 30 years. Simultaneously, she had developed an eating disorder which she said stemmed from media comments regarding her appearance; her excessive cocaine use helped keep her weight down. Additionally, Carlisle admitted to using LSD, quaaludes, and MDA regularly as both a teenager and adult. In a 2017 interview, she told &quot;The Guardian&quot; that she &quot;couldn&#x27;t believe [she wasn&#x27;t] dead&quot;.

In 2005, at the height of her drug abuse, Carlisle spent three days isolated in a London hotel room binging cocaine. At one point, she recalled that she looked at herself in the mirror and was alarmed that she &quot;didn&#x27;t see a light or a soul&quot; in her eyes. &quot;I sat in my room and did [cocaine] all evening. Between lines [of cocaine], I smoked cigarettes, played games on my laptop, and paced the room. I must have smoked ten packs of cigarettes in two days.&quot; On the third day, Carlisle said she had a vision of herself being found dead in a hotel, accompanied by an auditory hallucination in which a loud voice informed her: &quot;You are going to die here if you carry on like this.&quot; The incident jarred Carlisle into seeking sobriety, and she says she has been sober since 2005.

She told &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; in 2014: &quot;I don&#x27;t smoke anymore, I don&#x27;t drink any more and I don&#x27;t do drugs any more. I am very much into my Buddhism. I found turning 40 [in 1998] a real passage in time for me.&quot; Carlisle states in her autobiography &quot;Lips Unsealed: A Memoir&quot; (2010) that she has practiced Nichiren Buddhism as a member of the Soka Gakkai International since 2002, and she often mentions in press interviews that she chants &quot;Nam Myōhō Renge Kyō&quot; daily. She has also credited the practice with helping her maintain sobriety.

==Activism==
Carlisle supports LGBT rights, which she made public after her son, Duke, came out to her at age fourteen in 2006. 

In 2014, Carlisle co-founded Animal People Alliance, a nonprofit organization based in Calcutta, India, that raises funds and trains and employs impoverished women to care for street animals. &quot;We are teaching people that animals have feelings,&quot; says Carlisle. &quot;How to recognize a street animal in distress. There is a middle class developing and they still don&#x27;t have proper vet care, so a lot of what we do will be educational. We&#x27;re partnering with a hospital in Calcutta to teach about adoption and to get access to emergency rooms.&quot;

In June 2024, Carlisle was awarded with the 2024 YGB Namaste Award for her animal advocacy by the organization Yoga Gives Back.

<text>The Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) is a museum of art, world culture and natural history in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is one of the largest museums in North America and the largest in Canada. It attracts more than one million visitors every year, making it the most-visited museum in Canada. It is north of Queen&#x27;s Park, in the University of Toronto district, with its main entrance on Bloor Street West. Museum subway station is named after it and, since a 2008 renovation, is decorated to resemble the ROM&#x27;s collection at the platform level; Museum station&#x27;s northwestern entrance directly serves the museum.

Established on April 16, 1912, and opened on March 19, 1914, the ROM has maintained close relations with the University of Toronto throughout its history, often sharing expertise and resources. It was under direct control and management of the University of Toronto until 1968, when it became an independent Crown agency of the Government of Ontario. It is Canada&#x27;s largest field-research institution, with research and conservation activities worldwide.

With more than 18 million items and 40 galleries, the museum&#x27;s diverse collections of world culture and natural history contribute to its international reputation. It contains a collection of dinosaurs, minerals and meteorites; Canadian and European historical artifacts; as well as African, Near Eastern, and East Asian art. It houses the world&#x27;s largest collection of fossils from the Burgess Shale in British Columbia with more than 150,000 specimens. The museum also contains an extensive collection of design and fine art, including clothing, interior, and product design, especially Art Deco.

==History==

The Royal Ontario Museum was formally established on April 16, 1912, and was jointly governed by the Government of Ontario and the University of Toronto. Its first assets were transferred from the university and the Ontario Department of Education, coming from its predecessor, the Museum of Natural History and Fine Arts at the Toronto Normal School. On 19 March 1914, the Duke of Connaught, also the governor general of Canada, officially opened the Royal Ontario Museum to the public. The museum&#x27;s location at the edge of Toronto&#x27;s built-up area, far from the city&#x27;s central business district, was selected mainly for its proximity to the University of Toronto. The original building was constructed on the western edge of the property along the university&#x27;s Philosopher&#x27;s Walk, with its main entrance facing out onto Bloor Street housing five separate museums of the following fields: Archaeology, Palaeontology, Mineralogy, Zoology, and Geology. It cost to construct. This was the first phase of a two-part construction plan intended to expand toward Queen&#x27;s Park Crescent, ultimately creating an H-shaped structure.

The first expansion to the Royal Ontario Museum publicly opened on October 12, 1933. The -million renovation saw the construction of the east wing fronting onto Queen&#x27;s Park and required the demolition of Argyle House, a Victorian mansion at 100 Queen&#x27;s Park. As this occurred during the Great Depression, an effort was made to use primarily local building materials and to make use of workers capable of manually excavating the building&#x27;s foundations. Teams of workers alternated weeks of service due to the physically draining nature of the job.

In 1947, the ROM was dissolved as a body corporate, with all assets transferred to the University of Toronto. The museum remained a part of the university until 1968, when the museum and the McLaughlin Planetarium were separated from the university to form a new corporation.

On 26 October 1968, the ROM opened the McLaughlin Planetarium on the south end of the property after receiving a million donation from Colonel Samuel McLaughlin. In December 1995, the ROM closed the McLaughlin Planetarium as a result of budgetary cutbacks imposed by the Government of Ontario. The space temporarily reopened from 1998 to 2002, after being leased to Children&#x27;s Own Museum. In 2009, the ROM sold the building to the University of Toronto for and ensured that it would continue to be used for institutional and academic purposes.

The second major addition to the museum was the Queen Elizabeth II Terrace Galleries on the north side of the building and a curatorial centre built on the south, which started in 1978 and was completed in 1984. The new construction meant that a former outdoor &quot;Chinese Garden&quot; to the north of the building facing Bloor, along with an adjoining indoor restaurant, had to be dismantled. Opened in 1984 by Queen Elizabeth II, the million expansion took the form of layered terraces, each rising layer stepping back from Bloor Street. The design of this expansion won a Governor-General&#x27;s Award in Architecture.

In 1989, activists complained about its &quot;Into the Heart of Africa&quot; exhibit, which featured stereotypes of Africans, forcing curator Jeanne Cannizzo to resign.

Beginning in 2002, the museum underwent a major renovation and expansion project dubbed as &quot;Renaissance ROM.&quot; The Ontario and Canadian governments, both supporters of this venture, contributed $60 million toward the project, and Michael Lee-Chin donated $30 million. The campaign aimed not only to raise annual visitor attendance from 750,000 to between 1.4 and 1.6 million, but also to generate additional funding opportunities to support the museum&#x27;s research, conservation, galleries and educational public programs. The centrepiece of the project was a deconstructivist crystalline-form structure called the Michael Lee-Chin Crystal. The structure was created by architect Daniel Libeskind, whose design was selected from among 50 finalists in an international competition. The design of the Crystal required the Terrace Galleries to be torn down (the curatorial centre to the south remains). Existing galleries and buildings were also upgraded, along with the installation of multiple new exhibits over a period of months. The first phase of the Renaissance ROM project, the &quot;Ten Renovated Galleries in the Historic Buildings&quot;, opened to the public on 26 December 2005. The architectural opening of the Michael Lee-Chin Crystal took place less than 18 months later, on 2 June 2007. The final cost of the project was about million.

The original building was listed by the City of Toronto on the Municipal Heritage Register on 20 June 1973, designated under Part IV of the &quot;Ontario Heritage Act&quot; in 2003, with a Heritage Easement on the buildings.

===OpenROM renovation===

Much of the museum&#x27;s Bloor Street–facing side is being renovated since February 2024, as well as correcting architectural deficiencies to the Crystal while respecting Libeskind&#x27;s original architectural design. Renovations include an expanded skylight to provide more natural lighting to its atrium, as well as an additional staircase within the atrium, as well as the reconstruction of the entrance plaza to be level to allow for street performances.

==Buildings and architecture==
===Original building and eastern wing===

Designed by Toronto architects Frank Darling and John A. Pearson, the architectural style of the original building (now the western wing) is a synthesis of Italianate and Neo-Romanesque. The structure is heavily massed and punctuated by rounded and segmented arched windows with heavy surrounds and hood mouldings. Other features include applied decorative eave brackets, quoins and cornices.

The eastern wing facing Queen&#x27;s Park was designed by Alfred H. Chapman and James Oxley. Opened in 1933, it included the museum&#x27;s elaborate art deco, Byzantine-inspired rotunda and a new main entrance. The linking wing and rear (west) façade of the Queen&#x27;s Park wing were originally done in the same yellow brick as the 1914 building, with minor Italianate detailing. This façade broke away from the heavy Italianate style of the original structure. It was built in a neo-Byzantine style with rusticated stone, triple windows contained within recessed arches and different-coloured stones arranged in a variety of patterns. This development from the Roman-inspired Italianate to a Byzantine-influenced style reflected the historical development of Byzantine architecture from Roman architecture. Common among neo-Byzantine buildings in North America, the façade also contains elements of Gothic Revival in its relief carvings, gargoyles and statues. The ornate ceiling of the rotunda is covered predominantly in gold back painted glass mosaic tiles, with coloured mosaic geometric patterns and images of real and mythical animals.

Writing in the &quot;Journal of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada&quot; in 1933, A. S. Mathers said of the expansion:

The original building and the 1933 expansion have been listed since 1973 as heritage buildings of Toronto. In 2005, a major renovation of the heritage wings saw the galleries made larger, windows uncovered, and the original early 20th-century architecture made more prominent. The exteriors of the heritage buildings were cleaned and restored. The restoration of the 1914 and 1933 buildings was the largest heritage project undertaken in Canada. The renovation also included the newly restored Rotunda with reproductions of the original oak doors, a restored axial view from the Rotunda west through to windows onto Philosophers&#x27; Walk and ten renovated galleries comprising a total of .

In the master plan designed by Darling and Pearson in 1909, the ROM took a form similar to that of J. N. L. Durand&#x27;s ideal model of the museum. It was envisioned as a square plan with corridors running through the centre of the composition, converging in the middle with a domed rotunda. Overall, it referenced the upper-class palaces of the 17th and 18th centuries and aimed at having a strong sense of monumentality. All the architectural elements—the deep cornice, decorative top, eave brackets—add to this strength that the ROM possessed, as it was purely a structure with the function of collecting, but not of exhibiting.

During the mid-2010s, the eastern entrance was used as a café. Since late 2017, the eastern entrance is undergoing renovation to become an alternate entrance, complete with the addition of ramps to the eastern entrance. The eastern entrance is a few steps from the main entrance to Museum station.

===Curatorial centre===

Designed by Toronto architect Gene Kinoshita, with Mathers &amp; Haldenby, the curatorial centre forms the southern section of the museum. Completed in 1984, it was built during the same expansion as the former Queen Elizabeth II Terrace Galleries, which stood on the north side of the museum before the terrace galleries were replaced with the Michael Lee-Chin Crystal. The architecture is a simple modernist style of poured concrete, glass, and pre-cast concrete and aggregate panels. The curatorial centre houses the museum&#x27;s administrative and curatorial services and provides storage for artifacts that are not on exhibit. In 2006, the curatorial centre was renamed to Louise Hawley Stone Curatorial Centre in honour of the late Louise Hawley Stone, who donated a number of artifacts and various collections to the museum. In her will, she transferred C$49.7 million to the Louise Hawley Stone Charitable Trust, created to help with the upkeep of the building and to the acquisition of new artifacts.

===Michael Lee-Chin Crystal===
Replacing the Queen Elizabeth II Terrace Galleries was the controversial &quot;Michael Lee-Chin Crystal&quot;, a multimillion-dollar expansion to the museum designed by Daniel Libeskind, including a new sliding door entrance on Bloor Street, first opened in 2007. The Deconstructivist crystalline form is clad in 25 percent glass and 75 percent aluminum, sitting on top of a steel frame. The Crystal&#x27;s canted walls do not touch the sides of the existing heritage buildings but are used to close the envelope between the new form and existing walls. These walls act as a pathway for pedestrians to travel safely across the Crystal.

The building&#x27;s design is similar to some of Libeskind&#x27;s other works, notably the Jewish Museum in Berlin, the London Metropolitan University Graduate Centre and the Fredric C. Hamilton Building at the Denver Art Museum. The steel framework was manufactured and assembled by Walters Inc. of Hamilton, Ontario. The extruded anodized aluminum cladding was fabricated by Josef Gartner in Germany, the only company in the world that can produce the material. The company also provided the titanium cladding for Frank Gehry&#x27;s Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain.

On 1 June 2007, the governor-general of Canada, Michaëlle Jean, attended the Crystal&#x27;s architectural opening. This caused controversy because public opinion had been divided concerning the merits of its angular design. On its opening, &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; architecture critic Lisa Rochon complained that &quot;the new ROM rages at the world&quot;, was oppressive, angsty and hellish, while others—perhaps championed by her &quot;Toronto Star&quot; counterpart, Christopher Hume—hailed it as a monument. Some critics have ranked it as one of the ten ugliest buildings in the world. The project also experienced budget and construction time over-runs, and drew comparisons to the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao for using so-called &quot;starchitecture&quot; to attract tourism.

The main lobby is a three-storey high atrium, named the Hyacinth Gloria Chen Crystal Court. The lobby is overlooked by balconies and flanked by the J. P. Driscoll Family Stair of Wonders and the Spirit House, an interstitial space formed by the intersection of the east and west crystals.

Installation of the permanent galleries of the Lee-Chin Crystal began mid-June 2007, after a ten-day period when all the empty gallery spaces were open to the public. Within the Crystal there is a gift shop, C5 restaurant lounge (closed until further notice), a cafeteria, seven additional galleries and Canada&#x27;s largest temporary exhibition hall in a museum. The galleries added to the Crystal gave different aspects to the ROM: fascinating visuals, architectural artifacts and environment, art, correspondence between object and space and stories within the visuals. The C5 restaurant Lounge is designed by IV Design Associated Inc.

In October 2007, the Lee-Chin Crystal was reported to have suffered from significant water leakage, causing concerns for the building&#x27;s resilience to weather, especially in the face of the new structure&#x27;s proximate first winter. Although a two-layer cladding system was incorporated into the design of the Crystal to prevent the formation of dangerous snow loads on the structure, past architectural creations of Daniel Libeskind (including the Denver Art Museum) have also suffered from weather-related complications.

===Offsite storage===

Collections at the ROM not displayed at the ROM itself or in other museums are stored in various unclassified and offsite locations around the Greater Toronto Area.

==Galleries==
Originally, there were five major galleries at the ROM, one each for the fields of archaeology, geology, mineralogy, paleontology and zoology. In general, the museum pieces were labelled and arranged in a static fashion that had changed little since Edwardian times. For example, the insect exhibit that lasted up until the 1970s housed a variety of specimens from different parts of the world in long rows of glass cases. Insects of the same genus were pinned to the inside of the cabinet, with only the species name and location found as a description.

By the 1960s, more interpretive displays were ushered in, among the first of which was the original dinosaur gallery, established in the mid-1960s. Dinosaur fossils were now staged in dynamic poses against backdrop paintings and models of contemporaneous landscapes and vegetation. The displays became more descriptive and interpretive sometimes, as with the extinction of the woolly mammoth, offering several different leading theories on the issue for the visitor to ponder. This trend continued and up until the present day, the galleries became less staid and more dynamic or descriptive and interpretive. This trend arguably came to a culmination in the 1980s with the opening of The Bat Cave, where a sound system, strobe lights and gentle puffs of air attempt to recreate the experience of walking through a cave as a colony of bats fly out.

The original galleries were simply named after their subject material, but in more recent years, individual galleries have been named in honour of sponsors who have donated significant funds or collections to the institution. There are now two main categories of galleries present in the ROM: the Natural History Galleries and the World Culture Galleries.

The Samuel Hall Currelly Gallery is an exhibition space on Level 1, connecting the east wing of the museum with its western half. The gallery serves as the building&#x27;s main lobby past the museum&#x27;s admission area. As opposed to most galleries at the Royal Ontario Museum, the Samuel Hall Currelly Gallery is not dedicated to a single subject. Instead, the gallery exhibits an assortment of items from the museum&#x27;s collection representing them as a whole.

===Costumes and textiles===

The Patricia Harris Gallery of Costumes and Textiles holds about 200 artifacts from the ROM&#x27;s textile and costume collections. These pieces, which range from the 1st century BC to the present day, are rotated frequently due to their fragility. Throughout time, textiles and fashion have been used to establish identity and allow inferences to be drawn about a culture&#x27;s social customs, economy and survival. The gallery is devoted to showcasing transformations in textile design, manufacturing, and cultural relevance throughout the ages. Weaving, needlework, printed archeological textiles and silks are all located in this space.

===Interactive===
The CIBC Discovery Gallery was designed to be a children&#x27;s learning zone until its closure in 2023. It housed three main areas: In the Earth, Around the World and Close to Home. The space was inspired by the ROM&#x27;s collections and enabled children to participate in interactive activities involving touchable artifacts and specimens, period costumes, digging for dinosaur bones and examining fossils and meteorites. There was also a special area for preschoolers.

The Patrick and Barbara Keenan Family Gallery of Hands-On Biodiversity introduces visitors to the complicated relationships, which occur among all living things in a fun and interactive space. People of all ages can explore touchable specimens and interactive displays while gallery facilitators help visitors discover the living world around them. Mossy frogs, a touchable shark jaw, snakeskin, and a replica fox&#x27;s den are some of the objects that connect young visitors to the diversity and interdependence of plants and animals.

===Institute for Contemporary Culture===

The Roloff Beny Gallery of the Institute for Contemporary Culture (ICC) hosts the Royal Ontario Museum&#x27;s contemporary art exhibitions. This high-ceilinged multimedia gallery of approximately serves as the ICC&#x27;s main exhibition space, typically featuring exhibits that tie in contemporary culture and events, with the museum&#x27;s natural and world collection. The gallery has featured exhibitions on fashion photography, street art, modern Chinese urban design and architecture, and contemporary Japanese art. In 2018, it exhibited &quot;Here We Are: Black Canadian Contemporary Art&quot;, featuring Black Canadian artists such as Sandra Brewster, Michèle Pearson Clarke, Sylvia D. Hamilton, Bushra Junaid, Charmaine Lurch, and Esmaa Mohamoud.

===Natural history===

The natural history galleries are all gathered on the second floor of the museum, containing collections and examples of various specimens such as bats, birds and dinosaurs.

====Nature and animals====

The Life in Crisis: Schad Gallery of Biodiversity, designed by Reich+Petch and opened in late 2009, features endangered species, including specimens of a polar bear, a giant panda, a white rhinoceros, a Burmese python, Canadian coral, a leatherback sea turtle, a coelacanth, a &quot;Rafflesia&quot; flower and many other rare species. Included among these specimens is Bull, a southern white rhinoceros that became a famous conservation success story for his species. There are also recently extinct species displayed, including specimens of a passenger pigeon and a great auk, as well as skeletons of a dodo and a moa with a specimen of a moa egg, an elephant bird egg, and many other recently extinct species. The gallery presents the need to protect the natural environment and the need to educate the public about the main causes of extinction—overhunting, habitat destruction, and climate change. In September 2009, the gallery received an Award of Excellence by the Association of Registered Interior Designers of Ontario. In addition to showcasing the museum&#x27;s natural collection, the Schad Gallery also aims to promote the conservation of Earth&#x27;s biodiversity.

The Life in Crisis gallery is organized into three zones exploring the central themes: Life is Diverse, Life is interconnected, and Life is at Risk. Anthony Reich, principal at Reich+Petch, called biodiversity &quot;a big subject that&#x27;s become more relevant to everybody. The challenge was how to tell this big story in a space. We decided to design a dynamic, immersive experience with three core themes that hopefully will make a lasting impression on visitors.&quot;

The Tallgrass Prairies and Savannas is a part of the gallery that features one of the most endangered and diverse habitats in Ontario. The display features examples of the regions and the efforts by the Ontario Ministry of Northern Development, Mines, Natural Resources and Forestry to maintain and restore the tallgrass prairies and savannas.

The Gallery of Birds has on display many bird specimens from past centuries. The Gallery of Birds is dominated by the broad &quot;Birds in flight&quot; display where stuffed birds are enclosed in a glass display for visitors to experience. Dioramas allow visitors to learn about the many bird species and how environmental and habitual changes have put bird species in danger of extinction. Pull-out drawers let visitors examine eggs, feathers, footprints and nests more closely. The gallery included exhibits of other extinct species such as the passenger pigeon. These exhibits were later moved to the Schad Gallery.

The Royal Ontario Museum purchased a beached blue whale off the coast of Newfoundland at Trout River and displayed its skeleton and heart as a ROM-original travelling exhibit until 4 September 2017.

The Bat Cave is an immersive experience for visitors that presents over 20 bats and 800 models in a recreated habitat, with accompanying educational panels and video. Originally opened in 1988, the bat cave reopened on 27 February 2010 after extensive renovations. The exhibit most notably includes a recreation of St. Clair Cave located in Saint Catherine Parish of central Jamaica. The original cave was formed by an underground river that flowed below ground through the limestone and was three kilometres long. This cave was then recreated in the museum based on ROM fieldwork conducted in Jamaica in 1984. A large amount of bat research has been conducted with support from the ROM. In 2011, the ROM hosted a &quot;bat workshop&quot; connected with the 41st Annual North American Symposium on Bat Research.

====Earth and space====

The Teck Suite of Galleries: Earth&#x27;s Treasures features almost 3,000 specimens of minerals, gems, meteorites and rocks ranging from 4.5 billion years ago to the present. These items were found in many different locations including the Earth, Moon and beyond, and represent the Earth&#x27;s dynamic geological environment. Notable specimens at the Teck Suite of Galleries include fragments of the Tagish Lake meteorite. The Light of the Desert, the world&#x27;s largest faceted cerussite, is another notable piece displayed in the gallery.

Galleries that are a part of the Teck Suite of Galleries include the Barrick Gold Corporation Gallery, the Canadian Mining Hall of Fame Gallery, the Gallery of Gems and Gold and the Vale Gallery of Minerals.

====Fossils and evolution====

The Reed Gallery of the Age of Mammals explores the rise of mammals through the Cenozoic Era that followed the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs. There are over 400 specimens from North America and South America in addition to 30 fossil skeletons of extinct mammals. The gallery&#x27;s entrance begins with mammals that arose shortly after the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs. A highlight of this gallery is the sabre-toothed nimravid &quot;Dinictis&quot;.

The James and Louise Temerty Galleries of the Age of Dinosaurs and Gallery of the Age of Mammals feature many examples of complete non-avian dinosaur skeletons, as well as those of early birds, reptiles, mammals and marine animals ranging from the Jurassic to Cretaceous periods. The highlight of the exhibit is Gordo, one of the most complete examples of the &quot;Barosaurus&quot; specimen in North America and the largest dinosaur on display in Canada.

The Willner Madge Gallery, Dawn of Life opened in 2021 in the former Peter F. Bronfman Hall, and focuses on the evolution of life in the Paleozoic from billions of years ago up to the Late Triassic. It highlights many fossil sites and collections from Canada, such as the Burgess Shale in British Columbia and Mistaken Point in Newfoundland and Labrador. The gallery is divided into six sections: &quot;A Very Long Beginning&quot; (Precambrian), &quot;The Origin of Animals&quot; (Cambrian Explosion), &quot;The Bustling Seas&quot; (Ordovician, Silurian, and Devonian), &quot;The Green Earth&quot; (Devonian and Carboniferous, including both the Mississippian and the Pennsylvanian), &quot;Before the Great Dying&quot; (Permian) and &quot;Dawn of a New Era&quot; (Triassic). Notable specimens include the Burgess Shale, orthocones and sea scorpions and other fossils from Ontario and the holotype of &quot;Dimetrodon borealis&quot;.

The ROM also has a &quot;Zuul crurivastator&quot; skeleton from the Judith River Formation in Montana in its dinosaur collection, which is one of the most complete examples of an ankylosaurid specimen ever found.

===World culture===
The world culture galleries display a wide variety of objects from around the world. These range from Stone Age implements from China and Africa to 20th-century art and design. In July 2011, the museum added to this collection when a number of new permanent galleries were unveiled. Both the Government of Canada and the Royal Ontario Museum committed $2.75 million toward the project. The galleries are located on the first, third and fourth levels of the museum.

====Africa, the Americas, and Asia-Pacific====

<text>A classic car is typically described as an automobile 25 years or older, although a car&#x27;s age is not the only requirement it must meet before being considered a &quot;classic.&quot; However, a standard criteria for recognizing cars as classics does not exist, since different countries use their own rules and have their own regulations for classifying potential cars. Despite this, a common theme is that an older car of historical interest becomes collectible and tends to be restored rather than scrapped.

Organizations such as the Classic Car Club of America (CCCA) maintain lists of eligible unmodified cars called &quot;classic.&quot; These are described as &quot;fine&quot; or &quot;distinctive&quot; automobiles, either American or foreign-built, produced between 1915 and 1948.

Post-World War II classic cars are not precisely defined, and the term is often applied to any older vehicle.

==Recognition of classic status==
===Australia===
Australia has two main classic car registration categories: the Historic Vehicles Scheme (HVS) and the Classic Vehicle Scheme (CVS). The latter requires for vehicles over the age of 25 (or 30), yet feature modifications out of the age-range, to be considered ‘Historic.’ Under these categories, owners are not required to pay the usual registration fee. However, the use of the vehicle registered under the scheme is restricted to a set limit per registration term.

For example, most classic Ford Falcons, Chrysler Valiants and Holdens (alongside Toranas, and Commodores) are on either of the registers. However, it is not uncommon for these cars to end up with full registrations.

=== Canada ===
The Vintage Car Club of Canada (VCCC) recognizes vehicles 25 years old and older. The VCCC is one of Canada&#x27;s oldest collector car clubs. It has been a registered Society since the mid-1950s, and a continuous member of the (NAACC) National Association of Automobile Clubs of Canada Corporation since 1971.

The National Association of Automobile Clubs of Canada (NAACC) recognizes stock and modified vehicles that are at least 20 years old as classics. Depending on the value of the car, all imported &quot;classic or antique vehicles are subject to a 2.5% duty rate.&quot; There are, however, two exceptions: Firstly, the NAACC is responsible for doing away with import duties at the Canadian border for all vehicles and related parts 25 years old or older. Secondly, vehicles manufactured in Canada are also exempt from duties, as long as the car&#x27;s manufacturer can be verified.

=== United States ===

Cars produced in 1915 and older typically fall into the antique class, but the &quot;classic&quot; term is often applied loosely by owners to any car over 20 years old. There is some variation regarding the exact identification of a &quot;classic car.&quot; Division by separate eras includes horseless carriages (19th-century experimental automobiles such as the Daimler Motor Carriage), antique cars (brass era cars which are defined by the Horseless Carriage Club of America (HCCA) as &quot;any pioneer gas, steam or electric motor vehicle built or manufactured before 1 January 1916.&quot;), and classic cars (typically 1930s cars such as the Cord 812). Some also include muscle cars, with the 1974 model year as the cutoff.

In the United States, most states have time-based rules for defining &quot;historic&quot; or &quot;classic&quot; for legal purposes such as antique vehicle registration. Yet even requirements between states may vary, such as how Maryland defines historic vehicles as 20 years old or older, and they &quot;must not have been substantially altered, remodeled or remanufactured from the manufacturer&#x27;s original design&quot;. Separately, West Virginia simply defines motor vehicles manufactured at least 25 years before the current year as eligible for &quot;classic&quot; car license plates.

==== Classic Car Club of America ====
Sometimes the requirements for a car to be considered a classic are determined within a specific organization; they don&#x27;t even have to be consistent across organizations within the same nation.

The Classic Car Club of America describes a CCCA Classic as a &quot;fine&quot; or &quot;distinctive&quot; automobile, either American or foreign, produced between 1915 and 1948. Specifically, the CCCA term &quot;antique car&quot; has been confined to &quot;the functionally traditional designs of the earlier period&quot; (mostly pre-war). They tended to have removable fenders, trunk, headlights, and a usual vertical grill treatment. In a large vehicle, such as a Duesenberg, Pierce-Arrow, or in a more diminutive form, the MG TC, with traditional lines, might typify the CCCA term. The CCCA maintains this definition of &quot;classic car&quot; and uses terms such as &quot;CCCA Classic&quot; or the trademarked &quot;Full Classic&quot;.

The CCCA is dedicated to preserving and enjoying select cars that &quot;are distinguished by their respective fine design, high engineering standards, and superior workmanship.&quot; Other differentiating factors - including engine displacement, custom coachwork, and luxury accessories such as power brakes, power clutch, and &quot;one-shot&quot; or automatic lubrication systems - help determine whether a car is considered a &quot;CCCA Classic&quot;. The vehicles on their list &quot;represent the pinnacle of engineering, styling and design for their era.&quot; The CCCA has estimated that 1,366,843 &quot;American Classics&quot; were built.

Any CCCA member may petition for a vehicle to join the list. Such applications are carefully scrutinized, but rarely is a new vehicle type admitted. Moreover, no commercial vehicles such as hearses, ambulances, or race cars can be accepted as a &quot;Full Classic&quot;.

==== Antique Automobile Club of America ====
The Antique Automobile Club of America (AACA) recognizes &quot;motorized vehicles 25 years old or older, built in factories and specifically designed and manufactured for transportation use on public roadways and highways.&quot; The AACA evaluates such vehicles that are historical or that have &quot;been restored to the same state as the dealer could have prepared the vehicle for delivery to the customer.&quot; Specified AACA classic vehicles include &quot;fine or unusual domestic or foreign automobiles primarily built between and including the years 1925 and 1942.&quot;

=== United Kingdom ===
The United Kingdom has no fixed definition of a classic car. However, there are two taxation issues that lead to people using them as cutoff dates. All cars built over 40 years ago are exempt from paying the annual road tax. Also, such cars are exempt from the yearly UK safety test known as the MOT test, on condition that no substantial changes have been made to the vehicle concerned; however, the car can still be presented for testing voluntarily. This is known as &quot;Historic vehicle tax exemption.&quot; HM Revenue and Customs define a classic car for company taxation purposes as being over 15 years old and having a value over £15,000.

Additionally, widespread acclaim through car magazines can determine whether a particular vehicle is considered a classic. Still, the definition remains subjective and a matter of opinion.

=== Germany ===
In Germany, vehicles registered at least 30 years ago can apply for a special &quot;Oldtimer&quot; license plate with a €190/year flat tax. The cars are required to be in mostly original condition and a preservation-worthy appearance (grade C by popular car grading standards). At the same time, separate mandatory safety inspections establish the car&#x27;s roadworthiness. Modifications that enhance safety (seatbelts, disc brakes) and environmental friendliness (catalytic converter, LPG conversion if invisible from the outside) are universally accepted. Other modifications are generally accepted as long as they are contemporary with the car&#x27;s first registration (within 10 years before and after). The owner must provide historical proof, such as photographs, for verification. New paint jobs of any color are also accepted, including two-tone paint (if it was initially offered) and historic company logos—but no murals or custom patterns.

==Modern classics==
Modern classic cars are generally older, ranging from 15 to 25 years old. However, these are not always accepted as classics to certain areas and groups around the world, such as the Antique Automobile Club of America.
In the United Kingdom, the modern classic definition is often open to the discretion of Insurance Brokers and Insurance Companies who regard a Modern Classic as a vehicle considered collectible regardless of age. The usage of the car is limited to recreational purposes, and restricted mileage is also considered.

== Classic car styling ==
There was a worldwide change in styling trends in the immediate years after the end of World War II. For example, the 1946 Crosley and Kaiser-Frazer changed the traditional discrete replaceable-fender treatment. From then on, automobiles were designed with &quot;envelope bodies&quot; (Ponton cars) as a standard form.

==Fraud==
Classic cars are subject to various types of fraud, most notably provenance fraud, where owners falsify documentation and serial numbers to make a car&#x27;s history seem more colorful and historic. Fraud also assumes the form of knowingly inflating a car&#x27;s estimated resale value, as was referenced in court proceedings relating to JD Classics, one of the UK&#x27;s largest and best-known classic car dealers before its collapse in 2018.

==Emission levels==
Classic cars are typically built to meet the national car emission levels that were present in the year of production of the vehicle. EU and US emission standards have increased in many countries since then. As a result, they may not be allowed to enter cities with special emission restrictions or low emission zones. Converting the car to run on a different fuel (i.e., SVO, LPG, CNG, hydrogen, ...) may decrease emission levels.

==Safety ==

Classic cars often lack what are now considered basic safety features, including seat belts, crumple zones, or rollover protection. Vehicle handling characteristics (particularly steering and suspension) and brake performance are poorer than current standards, hence requiring greater road-awareness on the driver&#x27;s part. In certain jurisdictions of the United States, using a classic car as a daily vehicle is strongly discouraged and may even be considered illegal in some places.

In September 2009, ABC News&#x27; &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and &quot;World News&quot; showed a U.S. Insurance Institute of Highway Safety crash test of a 2009 Chevrolet Malibu in an offset head-on collision with a 1959 Chevrolet Bel Air sedan. It dramatically demonstrated the effectiveness of modern car safety design over 1950s X-frame design, particularly of rigid passenger safety cells and crumple zones.
Retro-styled (color-coded with chromed buckles) 2-point and 3-point seat (safety) belts are manufactured according to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). However, most classic car bodies (manufactured before the late 1960s) did not include safety belts as standard equipment and did not include readily available reinforced mounting points on the vehicle body. Therefore, it can be problematic to install such equipment properly: specific studies and calculations should be performed before any attempts. Proper installation is critical, which means locating attachment points on the body/frame, assuring the strength by good reinforcement, and following the seat belt installation instructions properly to reduce the risk of malfunction or failure.

Some classic car owners are reluctant to retrofit seat belts for the loss of originality this modification implies. There have also been instances of cars losing points at shows for being retrofitted with seat belts.

Fitting modern tires is also a suggestion to improve the handling.

However, most modern tires may be much wider and have a lower profile than those used on classic cars when new. Therefore, they may interfere with suspension elements and damage the tire walls. The suspension of a classic car may not be suitable for radial ply tires, having been designed to accommodate bias ply tires only. Narrow classic car wheels may have been designed for narrow, high-profile tube tires and may be unsuitable for modern tubeless radial tires. Another problem with modern tires on classic cars is that increased grip requires increased steering effort; many classic cars do not have power steering. Many major tire companies have dedicated classic car tire marketing departments and will be able to give expert technical advice to address all these issues. It is critical to know how radial tires will affect the performance of a car originally fitted with bias-ply tires, and the considerations needed to compensate for the differences.

Upgrading braking using either bespoke parts, parts produced by the vehicle&#x27;s manufacturer, from later versions of the same model, or later models that may be compatible with minor modification is an effective method of improving safety. Popular examples include drum brake to disc brake conversions, or adding a vacuum servo to cars with front disc brakes that did not initially have one.

Although they lack such advanced safety features as airbags, antilock braking systems, and other electronic controls, most US-market cars built in 1966 and later have basic safety features such as padded dashboards, seat belts, dual-circuit braking systems, and safety glass. A few of the newest classic cars (1980s and 1990s) have more advanced safety features such as airbags, anti-lock brakes, and side-impact beams. NHTSA began their full frontal crash test program in 1979, so these results are available for many post-1979 classic cars.

Despite these concerns, classic cars are involved in significantly fewer accidents.

==Market values==
There is a difference between the valuation of general classic car models and the valuation of a specific classic car. For example, two examples of the same classic car model may have different market values depending on idiosyncratic factors such as mileage, service history, documentation, restoration quality, originality, participation in special events, distinctions and awards, and association with notable people. Regarding the valuation of different car models, it has been demonstrated that observable characteristics of aesthetics, rarity, engineering, and performance determine classic car model values. In addition, classic car marques play a critical role in the determination of model values and account for considerable variation in values, even after controlling for observable classic car attributes.

<doc id="338367" wikidata="Q309980" url="?curid=338367" title="Edward Fox (actor)">
<text>Edward Charles Morice Fox (born 13 April 1937) is an English actor and a member of the Fox family.

Fox starred in the film &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot; (1973), playing the part of a professional assassin, known only as the &quot;Jackal&quot;, who is hired to assassinate the French president, Charles de Gaulle, in the summer of 1963. Fox is also known for his roles in &quot;Battle of Britain&quot; (1969), &quot;The Go-Between&quot; (1971), for which he won a BAFTA award, and &quot;The Bounty&quot; (1984). He also collaborated with director Richard Attenborough, appearing in his films &quot;Oh! What a Lovely War&quot; (1969), &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; (1977) and &quot;Gandhi&quot; (1982).

Fox won the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor for playing Edward VIII in the television drama series &quot;Edward &amp; Mrs. Simpson&quot; (1978). He also appeared in the historical series &quot;Taboo&quot; (2017). In addition to film and television work, Fox has received acclaim as a stage actor.

==Early life and education==
Fox was born the first of three sons on 13 April 1937 in Chelsea, London, the son of Robin Fox, a theatrical agent, and Angela Muriel Darita Worthington, an actress and writer. He is the father of actors Emilia Fox and Freddie Fox, the elder brother of actor James Fox and film producer Robert Fox, and an uncle of actor Laurence Fox. His paternal great-grandfather was industrialist and inventor Samson Fox, and his paternal grandmother was Hilda Hanbury, sister of stage performer Lily Hanbury. His maternal grandfather was dramatist Frederick Lonsdale, and his maternal grandmother was the daughter of football player and stockbroker Charles Morice. 

Fox was educated at Harrow School and completed his National Service in the Loyals, having failed to gain a commission in the Coldstream Guards. He left a two-year course at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, saying that it was not useful to him and did not compare to &quot;an apprenticeship in repertory theatre&quot;.

==Career==
Fox&#x27;s first film appearance was as an extra in &quot;The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner&quot; (1962). He also had a non-speaking part as a waiter in &quot;This Sporting Life&quot; (1963). Throughout the 1960s he worked mostly on stage, including a turn as &quot;Hamlet&quot;. In the late 1960s and early 1970s he established himself with roles in major British films, including &quot;Oh! What a Lovely War&quot; (1969), &quot;Battle of Britain&quot; (1969) and &quot;The Go-Between&quot; (1971). In &quot;The Go-Between&quot; he played the part of Lord Hugh Trimingham, for which he won a BAFTA award for Best Supporting Actor. His acting ability also brought him to the attention of director Fred Zinnemann, who was looking for an actor who was not well known and could be believable as the assassin in the film &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot; (1973). Fox won the role, beating other contenders such as Roger Moore and Michael Caine.

From then on Fox was much sought after, appearing in such films as &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; (1977) as Lieutenant General Horrocks, a role he has cited as a personal favourite, and for which he won the Best Supporting Actor award at the British Academy Film Awards. He also starred in &quot;Force 10 from Navarone&quot; (1978), with Robert Shaw and Harrison Ford.

In 1990 Fox appeared as a contestant on &quot;Cluedo&quot;, facing off against fellow actor Joanna David.

Fox portrayed King Edward VIII in the television drama &quot;Edward &amp; Mrs Simpson&quot; (1978). In the film &quot;Gandhi&quot; (1982), Fox portrayed Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer, who was responsible for the Amritsar massacre in India. He then appeared as M in the unofficial Bond film &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; (1983), a remake of &quot;Thunderball&quot; (1965). He also appeared in &quot;The Bounty&quot; (1984) and &quot;Wild Geese II&quot; (1985), both opposite Laurence Olivier, and in &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; (2002), &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; (2002), and &quot;Stage Beauty&quot; (2004).

Eliot, accompanied by the keyboard music of Johann Sebastian Bach, performed by Christine Croshaw. In 2010 Fox performed a one-man show, &quot;An Evening with Anthony Trollope&quot;, directed by Richard Digby Day. In 2013 he replaced Robert Hardy in the role of Winston Churchill in the premiere of &quot;The Audience&quot;, after Hardy had to withdraw for health reasons.

In 2010 Fox gave his support to a local campaign to prevent a supermarket being built close to his home in Dorset, citing the impact it would have upon small and independent businesses in the area. He chronicled the events in an article for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;.
