<text>Gertrude Caroline Ederle (; October 23, 1905 – November 30, 2003) was an American competition swimmer, Olympic champion, and world record-holder in five events. On August 6, 1926, she became the first woman to swim across the English Channel. Among other nicknames, the press called her &quot;Queen of the Waves&quot;.

== Amateur career ==
Ederle grew up in Manhattan where her father ran a butcher shop on Amsterdam Avenue, and learned to swim in Highlands, New Jersey. She later trained at the Women&#x27;s Swimming Association (WSA), founded by Charlotte Epstein. The WSA was an historic organization whose leadership and members campaigned for Women&#x27;s suffrage, and worked both to create more swimming events open to women and to increase their participation in the Olympics. Ederle joined the club when she was only twelve and immediately took to learning the American crawl, developed at the WSA by Head Coach Louis Handley. The same year, she set her first world record in the 880-yard freestyle, becoming the youngest world record holder in swimming. She set eight more world records after that, seven of them in 1922 at Brighton Beach. In total, Ederle held 29 US national and world records from 1921 until 1925.

===1924 Paris Olympic medalist===
At the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, Ederle won a gold medal as a member of the first-place U.S. team in the 4×100 meter freestyle relay. Together with her American relay teammates Euphrasia Donnelly, Ethel Lackie and Mariechen Wehselau, she set a new world record of 4:58.8 in the event final. Individually, she received bronze medals for finishing third in the women&#x27;s 100-meter freestyle and women&#x27;s 400-meter freestyle races. The U.S. Olympic team had its own ticker-tape parade in 1924.

== Professional career==

In 1925, Ederle turned professional. The same year she swam the from Battery Park to Sandy Hook in 7 hours and 11 minutes, a record time which stood for 81 years before being broken by Australian swimmer Tammy van Wisse. Ederle&#x27;s nephew Bob later described his aunt&#x27;s swim as a &quot;midnight frolic&quot; and a &quot;warm-up&quot; for her later swim across the English Channel.

=== English Channel crossing ===
In 1925, the Women&#x27;s Swimming Association sponsored Helen Wainwright and Ederle for an attempt at swimming across the English Channel. Helen Wainwright cancelled due to an injury, so Ederle decided to go to France on her own. She trained with Jabez Wolffe, a swimmer who had attempted to swim the English Channel 22 times. On August 18, 1925, Ederle made her first attempt at swimming the Channel whereupon she was disqualified when Wolffe ordered another swimmer (who was keeping her company in the water), Ishak Helmy, to recover her from the water. She bitterly disagreed with Wolffe&#x27;s decision and it was speculated that he did not want Ederle to succeed.

She returned to New York and began training with coach Bill Burgess who had successfully swum the Channel in 1911. Ederle also received a contract from both the New York &quot;Daily News&quot; and &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; which paid her expenses and provided her with a modest salary. Approximately one year after her first attempt, she was successful in swimming the Channel. She started at Cap Gris-Nez in France at 07:08 am on August 6, 1926, and came ashore at Kingsdown, Kent, 14 hours and 34 minutes later. The first person to greet her was a British immigration officer who requested a passport from &quot;the bleary-eyed, waterlogged teenager&quot;. Her record stood until Florence Chadwick swam the Channel in 1950 in 13 hours and 23 minutes.

Prior to Ederle, only five men had completed the swim across the English Channel, with the best time of 16 hours, 33 minutes by Enrique Tirabocchi.

When Ederle returned home, she was greeted with a ticker-tape parade in Manhattan, with more than two million people along the parade route.

=== Later career ===
She made an arrangement with Edward L. Hyman to appear at the Brooklyn Mark Strand Theatre, who paid her significantly more than any prior individual performer. Subsequently, she went on to play herself in a movie (&quot;Swim Girl, Swim&quot; starring Bebe Daniels) and tour the vaudeville circuit, including later Billy Rose&#x27;s Aquacade. She met President Coolidge and had a song and a dance step named for her. Her manager, Dudley Field Malone, was not able to capitalize on her fame and popularity, diminishing the financial potential of her vaudeville career. The Great Depression also affected the success of her career. A fall down the steps of her apartment building in 1933 twisted her spine and left her bedridden for several years, but she recovered sufficiently to appear at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair.nv

== Death ==

As a result of childhood measles, Ederle had poor hearing most of her life, and by the 1940s had lost most of her hearing. Aside from her time in vaudeville, she worked for much of her life as a swimming instructor for deaf children. She never married and by 2001 lived in a nursing home. She died on November 30, 2003, in Wyckoff, New Jersey, at the age of 98. She was interred in the Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York City.

==Legacy==
Ederle was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame as an &quot;Honor Swimmer&quot; in 1965. She was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2003.

An annual swim from New York City&#x27;s Battery Park to Sandy Hook, New Jersey, is named the Ederle Swim to honor her, and follows the course she swam.
The Gertrude Ederle Recreation Center, which opened in 2013 and is located in the Upper West Side of Manhattan, was named for her, and includes an indoor swimming pool.

A BBC Radio 4 play, &quot;The Great Swim&quot;, by Anita Sullivan, based on the 2008 book of the same name by Gavin Mortimer, was first broadcast on September 1, 2010, and repeated on January 23, 2012. It dramatizes Ederle&#x27;s record-breaking crossing of the English Channel.

A biographical film, &quot;Young Woman and the Sea&quot;, based on the book of the same name by Glenn Stout, was produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Jerry Bruckheimer, directed by Joachim Rønning, and starring Daisy Ridley as Ederle. The film was released on May 31, 2024.

<text>Jesse Francis &quot;Jeff&quot; Bingaman Jr. (born October 3, 1943) is an American retired politician who served as a United States Senator from New Mexico from 1983 to 2013. A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served as the 25th Attorney General of New Mexico from 1979 to 1983. During his time in the Senate, Bingaman served as Chairman of Committee Outreach for the Senate Democratic Caucus and was the longtime chair of the Senate Energy Committee.

Bingaman worked on Congressional committees on Armed Services; Energy and Natural Resources (Chairman); Finance; Health, Education Labor &amp; Pensions; Joint Economic Committee; among others. He advocated environmental issues such as for clean energy policies and protection of wildlife and public lands. Bingaman took positions favoring immigration reform with increased border enforcement coupled with a guest worker program.

After he left the Senate, he returned to his alma mater Stanford Law School as a fellow of its Steyer–Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance.

==Early life==
Bingaman was born in El Paso, Texas, the son of Frances Bethia (née Ball) and Jesse Francis Bingaman. He grew up in Silver City, New Mexico. His father taught at Western New Mexico University and his mother taught in the public schools system. At age 15, he earned the rank of Eagle Scout.

After graduating from Silver High School in 1961, Bingaman went on to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree in government from Harvard College in 1965. He then entered Stanford Law School, graduating in 1968.

After his admission to the bar, Bingaman commenced work as a private practice attorney alongside his wife. He also served as counsel to the New Mexico Constitutional Convention of 1969. From 1968 to 1974, Bingaman was a member of the U.S. Army Reserve. He attended basic training at Fort Dix, New Jersey, as a private and graduated from the chaplain enlisted assistant technician course at the Army Chaplain School, Fort Hamilton, New Jersey in April 1969.

==State Attorney General==
Bingaman worked briefly in the state attorney general&#x27;s office. He then ran for the leadership position of this office in 1978 and was elected. Environmental and antitrust issues were some of his biggest concerns while in this position.

==U.S. Senate==

===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Armed Services
**Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities
**Subcommittee on Personnel
**Subcommittee on Strategic Forces
*Committee on Energy and Natural Resources (Chairman)
*Committee on Finance
**Subcommittee on Health Care
**Subcommittee on Energy, Natural Resources, and Infrastructure (Chairman)
**Subcommittee on International Trade, Customs, and Global Competitiveness
**Subcommittee on Fiscal Responsibility and Economic Growth
*Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions
**Subcommittee on Children and Families
**Subcommittee on Primary Health and Aging
*Joint Economic Committee

===Caucus memberships===
*Congressional Competitiveness Caucus (Co-Chair)
*International Conservation Caucus
*Senate Diabetes Caucus

===Tenure===

Limited to seek other statewide office by the state constitution, Bingaman announced on January 14, 1981, his candidacy for the U.S. Senate, the first to do so. In 1982, Bingaman was elected to the Senate, defeating one-term Republican incumbent Harrison Schmitt. Bingaman accused Schmitt of not paying enough attention to local matters; his campaign slogan was &quot;What on Earth has he done for you lately?&quot;—a jab at Schmitt&#x27;s previous service as an astronaut who had walked on the Moon. He was reelected four times.

Bingaman was Chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and a member of the Finance Committee; Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee; and Joint Committee on the Economy.

Generally, Bingaman kept a fairly low national profile, even though he was the ninth most senior member of the Senate at the time of his retirement. He was very popular in New Mexico, facing substantive opposition only once, in 1994.

Bingaman and his Senate colleague Pete Domenici were the longest-serving duo among senators in the 110th United States Congress (2007–2009). In second place were Ted Kennedy and John Kerry of Massachusetts. Due to serving alongside Domenici, the longest-serving Senator in New Mexico&#x27;s history, Bingaman spent 26 years as New Mexico&#x27;s junior Senator, though ironically he had more seniority than all but a few of his colleagues. He was the most-senior junior senator in the 110th United States Congress.

On April 28, 2008, Bingaman endorsed Senator Barack Obama for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination.

On February 18, 2011, Bingaman announced that he would not seek reelection in 2012. He formally retired on January 3, 2013, ending the second-longest Senate tenure in the state&#x27;s history, behind only Domenici.

In his 2022 book &quot;Breakdown: Lessons for a Congress in Crisis&quot;, Bingaman discusses the erosion of congressional norms, outlines five governing obstacles for Congress members, evaluates their impact on eight major legislative actions during his term, and suggests improvements for Congress.

==Political positions==
===Immigration===
Being from a border state with Mexico, Bingaman was highly involved in the debate over illegal immigration. He believed in increased enforcement of borders to stem the flow of illegal immigrants, including more patrol agents and the use of surveillance cameras. However, he also believed that the U.S. should enact a guest worker program so that immigrants looking for honest work could arrive legally. Bingaman voted against the Secure Fence Act in 2006. He voted against declaring English to be the official language of the US government and voted in favor of continuing federal funds to self-declared &quot;sanctuary cities&quot;.

===Energy and the environment===
Throughout his political career, Bingaman had a pro-environmental record. He worked consistently to protect wildlife and public lands. He spoke publicly about the necessity of the Clean Energy Act of 2007, citing the importance of developing clean technology and green jobs. He stated his support for the bill&#x27;s principle of eliminating tax breaks on gas and oil companies.

Starting in 2006, Bingaman worked unsuccessfully to pass a bill that would have reduced greenhouse gas emissions via a &quot;cap and trade&quot; system. He stated his hope of reducing emissions to 1990 levels by 2030. His bill would also have increased federal funding for research and development of green technologies.

===Social issues===
Bingaman voted in line with the majority of his party on abortion, and he received a 100% rating from the pro-choice NARAL. He supported reinstating the Fairness Doctrine. Although he voted in 1996 for the Defense of Marriage Act, he voted against a proposed constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, and was ranked favorably by gay rights groups (such as 89% from the Human Rights Campaign). He also voted twice against a proposed amendment to ban flag desecration, and supported affirmative action.

===Iraq War===
On October 11, 2002, Jeff Bingaman was among the 23 Senators who voted against authorizing the Iraq War.

===Crime and torture===
Bingaman had a generally pro-rehabilitation stance on crime, supporting more programs to prevent youth crime, lower high school dropout rates, and stop drug use. Bingaman was an outspoken critic of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. He cited the need for due process of law for detainees by saying:

The current practice of holding detainees or prisoners indefinitely, without affording them basic due process rights, has been widely criticized in this country and throughout the world. For a country such as ours that has consistently advocated for the rule of law, the policies of the current administration are nothing short of a major embarrassment ... How we handle prisoners can have a dramatic impact on how our own men and women are treated in the event they are themselves taken prisoner.

===Health care reform===
Bingaman supported President Barack Obama&#x27;s health reform legislation; he voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in December 2009, and voted for the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.

==Electoral history==











 




==Personal life==
Bingaman met his wife Anne Kovacovich when both were attending Stanford Law School. They have one son, John, who served as the chief of staff for New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (2019–2020).

==Awards and honors==
On December 13, 2008, Bingaman was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from New Mexico State University at the university&#x27;s Fall 2008 commencement ceremony.

He received the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award from the Boy Scouts of America.

<text>The following is a list of the governors and lieutenant governors of Nova Scotia. Though the present day office of the lieutenant governor in Nova Scotia came into being only upon the province&#x27;s entry into Canadian Confederation in 1867, the post is a continuation from the first governorship of Nova Scotia in 1710. For much of the time, the full title of the post was Governor of Nova Scotia and Placentia (Placentia, Newfoundland). Before the British occupation of Nova Scotia, the province was governed by French Governors of Acadia. From 1784 to 1829 Cape Breton Island was a separate colony with a vice regal post.

<text>The Big Sandy River, called Sandy Creek as early as 1756, is a tributary of the Ohio River, approximately long, in western West Virginia and northeastern Kentucky in the United States. The river forms part of the boundary between the two states along its entire course. Via the Ohio River, it is part of the Mississippi River watershed.

It is formed between Louisa, Kentucky, and Fort Gay, West Virginia, by the confluence of the Tug Fork and Levisa Fork. It flows generally northwardly in a highly meandering course, between Lawrence and Boyd counties in Kentucky and Wayne County in West Virginia. It joins the Ohio between Catlettsburg, Kentucky and Kenova, West Virginia, west of Huntington, West Virginia, at the common boundary between West Virginia, Kentucky, and Ohio.

The river is navigable and carries commercial shipping, primarily coal mined in the immediate region.

The name of the river, originally called Sandy Creek by 1756, comes from the presence of extensive sand bars. The Native American names for the river included &quot;Tatteroa&quot;, &quot;Chatteroi&quot;, and &quot;Chatterwha&quot;. The name &quot;Big Sandy&quot; was in use no later than February, 1789.

George Washington surveyed land at the mouth of the river between 1768 and 1772.

==First Americans==
Some Native American groups have links to the area and region, such as the Shawnee, Cherokee, Tutelo, Issa, and others.

==Sandy Creek Expedition==
In 1756, as part of the French and Indian War, the Sandy Creek Expedition occurred in the valley.

==Early Anglo settlement==
The tombstone of David White, an early settler along the river in Kentucky, marks his passing in 1817 with the note that he lived many years near the Mouth of the Big Sandy.

==Civil War==
Several notable personalities relating to the Civil War hailed from the Big Sandy Valley. Likewise, the valley hosted important war-time events.

==Hatfield-McCoy Feud==
The Tug Fork of the Big Sandy River is the site of the Hatfield-McCoy feud.

==Martin County sludge spill==
On October 11, 2000, the Martin County sludge spill polluted hundreds of miles of the Ohio River, the Big Sandy River and its tributaries. The accident was caused when a coal sludge impoundment owned by Massey Energy in Kentucky broke into an abandoned underground mine below. Toxic pollutants including heavy metals such as mercury, lead, arsenic, copper and chromium were found in the sludge that spilled into these waterways.

The spill was 30 times larger than the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; oil spill () and one of the worst environmental disasters ever in the southeastern United States, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

==Popular culture==
Two well-known fiddle tunes take their name from the Big Sandy River: &quot;Sandy River Belle&quot; and the &quot;Big Sandy River&quot;. Loretta Lynn&#x27;s &quot;Van Lear Rose&quot; and Dwight Yoakam&#x27;s &quot;Bury Me&quot; also mention the river.

<doc id="335051" wikidata="Q209540" url="?curid=335051" title="Scioto River">
<text>The Scioto River ( ) is a river in central and southern Ohio more than in length. It rises in Hardin County just north of Roundhead, Ohio, flows through Columbus, Ohio, where it collects its largest tributary, the Olentangy River, flows south into Appalachian Ohio, and meets the Ohio River at Portsmouth. Early settlers and Native Americans used the river for shipping, but it is too small for modern commercial craft. The primary economic importance for the river now is for recreation and drinking water. It is the longest river that is entirely within Ohio.

The Scioto River is represented on the Ohio state seal and coat of arms.

==Geography and geology==
The lower Scioto River valley is large compared to the width of the river and is extensively farmed. Meltwaters from retreating glaciers carved the valley exceptionally wide. Valley bottoms are smooth, and flood deposits created during and since the most recent Glacial period cause floodplain soils to be very productive. As a result, farms line much of the lower Scioto where it flows through low, rolling hills covered in hardwood trees.

The geologic history of the Scioto River is tied to the destruction of the Teays River network during the Ice Ages and consequent creation of the Ohio River. The north flowing Teays River was dammed by glaciers, and damming of other rivers led to a series of floods as lakes overflowed into adjacent valleys. Glacial Lake Tight is estimated to have been two-thirds the size of modern Lake Erie. Valleys beyond the reach of glaciers were reorganized to create the Ohio River, and the Scioto River replaced the Teays River. The Scioto River flows through segments of the Teays River valley but opposite the direction the Teays River flowed. In the cities of Columbus and Dublin, the river has cut a gorge in fossil-bearing Devonian limestone, and many tributary streams have waterfalls, such as Hayden Falls.

== History ==

The Scioto River valley was home to many Native American cultures. The best known groups are the mound builders of the Hopewell tradition 2000 years ago, the Adena tradition 3000 years ago, and the later Fort Ancient culture about 1000 years ago. Numerous Hopewell earthworks can be seen near Chillicothe at Hopewell Culture National Historic Park. The former strength of these cultures is demonstrated in settler accounts from as far east as Virginia. The name &quot;Scioto&quot; is derived from the Wyandot word &#x27;deer&#x27; (compare &quot;Shenandoah&quot;, derived from the word for deer in another Iroquoian language).

During the antebellum years, the Scioto River provided a route to freedom for many slaves escaping from the South, as they continued north after crossing the Ohio River. Towns such as Chillicothe became important stops on the Underground Railroad.

A traditional fiddle tune in the Appalachian repertoire, “Big Scioty”, takes its name from the river. The melody is attributed to the Hammons family of West Virginia.

In 2012, the river dropped to record- or near-record-low water levels as a result of the acute effects of the 2012 North American drought in Ohio.

==Dams and reservoirs==
There are two major dams on the river. Griggs Dam in Columbus was built in 1904–1908 to impound a water supply for the city. Farther upstream, at Shawnee Hills, the O&#x27;Shaughnessy Dam was built in 1922–1925 creating a larger reservoir which was billed at the time as &quot;the finest inland waterway in the United States.&quot; Both dams are operated by the city of Columbus.

The removal of the Main Street Dam in downtown Columbus, which was built in 1921, began in November 2013. The $35.5 million removal project was initially proposed in the 2010 Strategic Plan for downtown Columbus and was funded by a coalition of public and private entities. Prior to its demolition, the Main Street Dam impounded roughly of the Scioto River, artificially enlarging its width to an average of in downtown Columbus. Once completed, the Scioto Greenways project will reduce the width by nearly half, and expose of land which will be reclaimed as parkland by the city. Riffles and pools will be restored to the river channel, returning it to its natural riparian state. Experts believe the restoration project will result in a healthier river and better habitat for native plant, fish, and mussel species.

<doc id="335053" wikidata="Q319111" url="?curid=335053" title="Chris Dodd">
<text>Christopher John Dodd (born May 27, 1944) is an American lobbyist, lawyer, and Democratic Party politician who served as a United States senator from Connecticut from 1981 to 2011. Dodd is the longest-serving senator in Connecticut&#x27;s history. He previously served in the United States House of Representatives from 1975 to 1981.

Dodd is a Connecticut native and a graduate of Georgetown Preparatory School in Bethesda, Maryland, and Providence College. His father, Thomas J. Dodd, was also a United States Senator from 1959 to 1971. Chris Dodd served in the Peace Corps for two years prior to entering the University of Louisville School of Law, and during law school concurrently served in the United States Army Reserve.

Dodd returned to Connecticut, winning election in 1974 to the U.S. House of Representatives from Connecticut&#x27;s 2nd congressional district and was reelected in 1976 and 1978. He was elected to the United States Senate in 1980. Dodd served as general chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 1995 to 1997. He served as Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee from 2007 until his retirement from politics. In 2006, Dodd decided to run for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States, but eventually withdrew after running behind several other competitors.

In January 2010, Dodd announced that he would not run for re-election. Dodd was succeeded by fellow Democrat Richard Blumenthal. Dodd then served as chairman and chief lobbyist for the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) from 2011 to 2017. In 2018, Dodd returned to the practice of law, joining the firm Arnold &amp; Porter. In addition to being a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One, Dodd was a close advisor to President Joe Biden and served on his vice presidential selection committee.

==Early life, education, and early political career==
Dodd was born in Willimantic, Connecticut. His parents were Grace Mary Dodd (née Murphy) and U.S. Senator Thomas Joseph Dodd; all eight of his great-grandparents were born in Ireland. He is the fifth of six children; his eldest brother, Thomas J. Dodd Jr., is a professor emeritus of the School of Foreign Service of Georgetown University, and served as the U.S. ambassador to Uruguay and Costa Rica under President Bill Clinton.

Dodd attended Georgetown Preparatory School, a Jesuit boys&#x27; school in Bethesda, Maryland. He graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English literature from Providence College in 1966. He served as a Peace Corps volunteer in a small rural town called Moncion, in the Dominican Republic from 1966 to 1968. While there, he became fluent in Spanish. (Later, while in Congress, his support for language study resulted in his being awarded the Northeast Conference on the Teaching of Foreign Languages Advocacy Award in 1986.) Dodd was awarded his Juris Doctor from the University of Louisville in 1972. He also joined the United States Army Reserve, serving until 1975.

== U.S. House of Representatives (1975–1981) ==
Dodd was part of the &quot;Watergate class of &#x27;74,&quot; which CNN pundit David Gergen credited with bringing &quot;a fresh burst of liberal energy to the Capitol.&quot; Elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from Connecticut&#x27;s 2nd congressional district and reelected twice, he served from January 4, 1975, to January 3, 1981. During his tenure in the House, he served on the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations.

==U.S. Senate (1981–2011)==

===Elections===
Dodd was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1980, and was reelected in 1986, 1992, 1998, and 2004. He is the first senator from Connecticut to serve five consecutive terms.

Facing a competitive reelection bid for his Senate seat in 2010 and trailing against both of his likely Republican challengers in public opinion polling, Dodd announced in January 2010 that he would not seek re-election for a sixth term in the Senate. Polls of Connecticut voters in 2008 and 2009 had consistently suggested Dodd would have difficulty winning re-election, with 46% viewing his job performance as fair or poor and a majority stating they would vote to replace Dodd in the 2010 election.

===Tenure===
During the 1994 elections, the Republicans won the majority in both houses of Congress. Dodd therefore entered the minority for the second time in his Senate career. He ran for the now vacant position of Senate Minority Leader, but was defeated by South Dakota Senator Tom Daschle by one vote. The vote was tied 23–23, and it was Colorado Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell who cast the deciding vote by absentee ballot in favor of Daschle.

From 1995 to 1997, he served as General Chairman of the Democratic National Committee. As General Chairman, Dodd was the DNC&#x27;s spokesman. Donald Fowler served as National Chairman, running the party&#x27;s day-to-day operations.
Dodd has also involved himself in children&#x27;s and family issues, founding the first Senate Children&#x27;s Caucus and authoring the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which requires larger employers to provide employees unpaid leave in the event of illness, a sick family member, or the birth or adoption of a child. To date, more than 50 million employees have taken advantage of FMLA mandates. He is working to support a bill that would require employers to provide paid family and medical leave. For his work on behalf of children and families, the National Head Start association named him &quot;Senator of the Decade&quot; in 1990.

Dodd briefly considered running for president in 2004, but ultimately decided against such a campaign and endorsed fellow Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman. He then was considered as a likely running mate for his friend, eventual Democratic nominee John Kerry. He was also considered a possible candidate for replacing Daschle as Senate Minority Leader in the 109th Congress, but he declined, and that position was instead filled by Harry Reid.

Dodd maintained an office in Hartford, Connecticut, which was burglarized in 2007 by a man stealing property for subsequent sale to support his drug habit.

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Foreign Relations
** Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Peace Corps and Narcotics Affairs (chairman)
** Subcommittee on Near Eastern and South and Central Asian Affairs
** Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs
** Subcommittee on European Affairs

==2008 Presidential campaign==
On January 11, 2007, Dodd announced his candidacy for the office of President of the United States on the &quot;Imus in the Morning&quot; show. On January 19, 2007, Dodd made a formal announcement with supporters at the Old State House in Hartford.
OpenSecrets noted that the Dodd campaign was heavily funded by the financial services industry, which is regulated by committees Dodd chairs in the Senate.

In an unusual move, Dodd shared a plane with one of his rivals for the 2008 nomination. Dodd&#x27;s friend and fellow US Senator Joe Biden was running his own long-shot campaign, and the two saved money by sharing a campaign plane.

In May, Dodd trailed in state and national polls and acknowledged he was not keeping pace with rival campaigns&#x27; fund raising. However, he said that as more voters became aware of his opposition to the Iraq War, they would support his campaign. However, his prospects did not improve; a November 7, 2007 Gallup poll placed him at 1%.

Dodd dropped out of the primary race on the night of the January 3, 2008 Iowa caucuses after placing seventh with almost all precincts reporting, even though he had recently moved from his home state to Iowa for the campaign.

Among eight major candidates for the nomination Dodd, even with later states where he was on the ballot after withdrawal, won last place by popular vote in primary (after Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, John Edwards, Bill Richardson, Dennis Kucinich, Joe Biden and Mike Gravel, also including uncommitted delegates and scattering votes). He won a total of 25,252 votes in delegates primaries and 9,940 in penalized contests.

Dodd later said he was not interested in running for Vice President or Senate Majority Leader, and endorsed former rival Barack Obama on February 26, 2008.

==Post-Senate career==
===Motion Picture Association of America===
In February 2011, despite &quot;repeatedly and categorically insisting that he would not work as a lobbyist,&quot; Dodd replaced Dan Glickman as chairman of and chief lobbyist for the MPAA.

On January 17, 2012, Dodd released a statement criticizing &quot;the so-called &#x27;Blackout Day&#x27; protesting anti-piracy legislation.&quot; Referring to the websites participating in the blackout, Dodd said, &quot;It is an irresponsible response and a disservice to people who rely on them for information and use their services. It is also an abuse of power... when the platforms that serve as gateways to information intentionally skew the facts to incite their users in order to further their corporate interests.&quot; In further comments, Dodd threatened to cut off campaign contributions to politicians who did not support the Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act and the Stop Online Piracy Act, legislation supported by the MPAA.

On September 4, 2017, Dodd stepped down as MPAA CEO, and was replaced by former U.S. Ambassador to France and Assistant Secretary of State for Economic and Business Affairs Charles Rivkin.

===Law practice===
Following his tenure at MPAA, Dodd joined law firm Arnold &amp; Porter in Washington, D.C.

===2020 U.S. presidential election and Biden administration===
During the 2020 Democratic primary, Dodd was an advisor and surrogate for the campaign of his friend and colleague Joe Biden. Dodd was a member of Biden&#x27;s vice presidential search committee. He was reported to have spoken against picking California Senator Kamala Harris—saying that &quot;she had no remorse&quot; for &quot;her ambush on Biden in the first Democratic [primary] debate&quot;—and to have advocated for California Congresswoman Karen Bass to be selected instead because &quot;she’s a loyal No. 2.&quot;

On March 1, 2021, the public relations and advisory company Teneo announced that it was hiring Dodd, while he was a top advisor to President Biden, as a senior advisor at the company, and that Teneo had acquired a significant minority stake in the consulting firm WestExec Advisors, which had very close ties to the new Biden administration.

==Controversies==
===Countrywide Financial loan controversy===
In his role as chairman of the Senate Banking Committee Dodd proposed a program in June 2008 that would assist troubled sub-prime mortgage lenders such as Countrywide Financial in the wake of the United States housing bubble&#x27;s collapse. &quot;Condé Nast Portfolio&quot; reported allegations that in 2003 Dodd had refinanced the mortgages on his homes in Washington, D.C., and Connecticut through Countrywide Financial and had received favorable terms due to being placed in the &quot;Friends of Angelo&quot; VIP program, so named for Countrywide CEO Angelo Mozilo. Dodd received mortgages from Countrywide at allegedly below-market rates on his Washington, D.C., and Connecticut homes. Dodd had not disclosed the below-market mortgages in any of six financial disclosure statements he filed with the Senate or Office of Government Ethics since obtaining the mortgages in 2003.

Dodd&#x27;s press secretary said &quot;The Dodds received a competitive rate on their loans,&quot; and that they &quot;did not seek or anticipate any special treatment, and they were not aware of any,&quot; then declined further comment. The &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; reported Dodd had taken &quot;a major credibility hit&quot; from the scandal. At the same time, the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee Kent Conrad and the head of Fannie Mae Jim Johnson received mortgages on favorable terms due to their association with Countrywide CEO Angelo Mozilo. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and two Connecticut papers have demanded further disclosure from Dodd regarding the Mozilo loans.

On June 17, 2008, Dodd met twice with reporters and gave accounts of his mortgages with Countrywide. He admitted to reporters in Washington, D.C., that he knew as of 2003 that he was in a VIP program, but claimed it was due to being a longtime Countrywide customer, not due to his political position. He omitted this detail in a press availability to Connecticut media.

On July 30, 2009, Dodd responded to news reports about his mortgages by releasing information from &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; showing that both mortgages he received were in line with those being offered to general public in fall 2003 in terms of points and interest rate.

On August 7, 2009, a Senate ethics panel issued its decision on the controversy. The Select Committee on Ethics said it found &quot;no credible evidence&quot; that Dodd knowingly sought out a special loan or treatment because of his position, but the panel also said in an open letter to Dodd that the lawmaker should have questioned why he was being put in the &quot;Friends of Angelo&quot; VIP program at Countrywide: &quot;Once you became aware that your loans were in fact being handled through a program with the name &#x27;V.I.P.,&#x27; that should have raised red flags for you.&quot;

===Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac controversies===

Dodd was involved in issues related to the federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac during the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis. As part of Dodd&#x27;s overall mortgage bill the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 before Congress in the summer of 2008, Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson sought provisions enabling the Treasury to add additional capital and regulatory oversight over these government-sponsored enterprises. At the time, it was estimated that the federal government would need to spend $25 billion (~$ in ) on a bailout of the firms.

During this period, Dodd denied reports claiming that these firms were in financial crisis. He called the firms &quot;fundamentally strong,&quot; said they were in &quot;sound situation&quot; and &quot;in good shape&quot; and to &quot;suggest they are in major trouble is not accurate.&quot; In early September, after the firms continued to report huge losses, Secretary Paulson announced a federal takeover of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Dodd expressed skepticism of the action, which the Treasury estimated could cost as much as $200 billion.

Dodd was the top recipient in Congress, followed by John Kerry, Barack Obama, then Hillary Clinton, of campaign funds from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac during 1989–2008.

===Irish cottage controversy===
In February 2009, Kevin Rennie, a columnist at the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot;, ran an op-ed concerning Dodd&#x27;s acquisition of his vacation home in Roundstone, Ireland. The article alleged that Dodd&#x27;s former partner in buying the home had ties to disgraced Bear Stearns principal Edward Downe, Jr. who had since been convicted of insider trading by the Securities and Exchange Commission. After paying an $11 million fine for his role in the scam, Downe later obtained a pardon in the waning days of the Bill Clinton administration. The controversial pardon was granted after Dodd lobbied Clinton on Downe&#x27;s behalf. Dodd&#x27;s letter to the President said, &quot;Mr. President, Ed Downe is a good person, who is truly sorry for the hurt he caused others.&quot; After Downe&#x27;s pardon, Dodd bought out the interests of his partner for a price allegedly based on a 2002 bank appraisal of the Roundstone home, which yielded little profit for Dodd&#x27;s partner. Rennie criticized Dodd for claiming the Roundstone home was worth less than $250,000 in Senate ethics filings; some observers estimated the likely value in excess of US$1 million.

In June 2009, Dodd provided a new statement to the Senate reporting the actual value of his Irish property at $658,000 (~$ in ). &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; later compared this issue to the ethical charges which led to the political demise of Alaska Senator Ted Stevens.

===AIG federal assistance and bonuses controversy===
From the fall of 2008 through early 2009, the United States government spent nearly $170 billion to assist failing insurance giant American International Group. AIG then spent $165 million of this money to hand out executive &quot;retention&quot; bonuses to its top executives. Public outrage ensued over this perceived misuse of taxpayer dollars.

The Fox Business Network&#x27;s Rich Edson broke the story claiming Dodd was responsible for the inclusion of a clause limiting excessive executive pay in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. On February 14, 2009, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; published an article, Bankers Face Strict New Pay Cap, discussing a retroactive limit to bonus compensation inserted by Dodd into the stimulus bill that passed in the Senate.

The same article went on to mention that Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Lawrence Summers &quot;had called Sen. Dodd and asked him to reconsider.&quot;

When the bill left conference, Dodd&#x27;s provision had been amended to include a provision preventing limits on bonuses previously negotiated and under contract. This provision was lobbied for by Geithner and Summers.

As Dodd explained in a March 18, 2009 interview on CNN, at Geithner and the Obama Administration&#x27;s insistence he allowed his provision&#x27;s original language to include Geithner and Summers&#x27; request, which in turn allowed AIG to give out bonuses under previously negotiated contracts. However, Dodd&#x27;s provision also included language allowing the Treasury Secretary to examine bonuses doled out and, if they were found to be in violation of the public interest, recoup those funds.

Dodd retreated from his original statement that he did not know how the amendment was changed. Dodd was criticized by many in the Connecticut media for the flip-flop. In a March 20, 2009 editorial the New Haven Register called Dodd &quot;a lying weasel&quot; The same day, Hartford Courant columnist Rick Green called on Dodd not to seek re-election in 2010.

&quot;The Hill&quot; described Dodd as &quot;reeling&quot; from the controversy and having &quot;stepped in it&quot; after changing his story about the bonus amendment.

At a press conference in Enfield, Connecticut, on March 20, 2017, Dodd responded to critics and explained that his original answer to CNN was based on a misunderstanding of the question. He also said he was disappointed that the Treasury officials who asked him to make the legislative changes had not identified themselves, refusing to confirm the identity of the individuals responsible for changing the amendment.

The Manchester &quot;Journal Inquirer&quot; suggested that &quot;Chris Dodd&#x27;s explaining may have only begun.&quot;

Opensecrets.org reported that Dodd received over $223,000 from AIG employees, many of whom were Connecticut residents, for his campaigns. Additionally, realclearpolitics.com reported that Dodd&#x27;s wife was a former director for Bermuda-based IPC Holdings, a company controlled by AIG. She held this position before she married him. On May 3, 2009, the &quot;Courant&quot; reported Dodd&#x27;s wife served on a number of corporate boards, including the CME Group and could be earning as much as $500,000 annually for those services.
On March 30, 2009, The Courant reported that former AIG Financial Products head Joseph Cassano personally solicited contributions from his employees in Connecticut via an e-mail in fall 2006, suggesting that the contributions were related to Dodd&#x27;s ascension to the chairmanship of the Senate Banking Committee.

===Sexual assault allegation===
In 1985, Dodd and fellow Senator Ted Kennedy, were involved in an incident at a Washington restaurant, which a waitress reported allegations that the pair sexually assaulted her. According to an account in &quot;GQ&quot; magazine, Kennedy grabbed waitress Carla Gaviglio, and rubbed his genital area against hers, while pressing her against Dodd&#x27;s lap. The incident was corroborated to the magazine by another waitress, as well as the restaurant&#x27;s owner.

In late-April 2020, it was announced that Dodd was a member of the vetting committee for the selection of presumptive Democratic Party presidential nominee Joe Biden&#x27;s running mate. The appointment caused Gaviglio&#x27;s allegation to re-appear in the news, in the context of the #metoo movement, and Biden&#x27;s own sexual assault allegation.

During this time, Gaviglio spoke again of the incident, acknowledging that Kennedy was the instigator, but also laying blame on Dodd. When asked about the vice presidential search, she stated she would still vote for Biden, but disapproved of Dodd being part of the selection process.

==Political positions==
Dodd supported amending the Family and Medical Leave Act, which he authored in 1993, to include paid leave, and a corporate carbon tax to combat global warming.

Dodd is credited with inserting the last-minute pay limit into American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The pay restrictions included prohibition of bonuses in excess of one-third of total salary for any company receiving any money from the plan and was retroactive to companies that received funds under Troubled Assets Relief Program. &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine however, panned this provision as likely to &quot;drive the craftiest financial minds away from the most troubled institutions.&quot; This article also pointed out the Dodd bill delegated to the Treasury Secretary the right to approve appropriate restaurants for client entertainment.

In May 2009, Dodd was the author and lead sponsor of the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act of 2009, which was signed into law by President Barack Obama on May 22, 2009. The law requires card companies give cardholders 45 days notice of any interest rate increases, prevents card companies from retroactively increasing interest rates on the existing balance of a cardholder in good standing for reasons unrelated to the cardholder&#x27;s behavior with that card, and prohibits card companies from arbitrarily changing the terms of their contract with a cardholder, banning the so-called practice of &quot;any-time, any-reason repricing.&quot; Also included in the bill were provisions requiring companies to give cardholders time to pay their bills by requiring card companies to mail billing statements 25 calendar days before the due date and individuals under the age of 21 to either show income or have a co-signer in order to obtain a credit card. In a conference call with reporters after the bill was signed, Dodd stated his intention to continue work on capping credit card interest rates at thirty percent and to establish limits on fees that merchants pay when a customer uses a credit card for a purchase.

Dodd announced on June 22, 2009, that he supports same-sex marriage. He had opposed gay marriage in the 2008 election, but stated that his daughters are growing up in a different generation than his and that his views have evolved over time. Same-sex couples have been able to marry in Connecticut since November 12, 2008, following the Connecticut Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling. In April 2009, the legislature overwhelmingly passed and Governor Jodi Rell signed a bill making all references to marriage in law gender neutral.

==Personal life==
In 1970, Dodd married Susan Mooney; they divorced in 1982. Afterwards, he dated at different times Bianca Jagger and Carrie Fisher, among others.

In 1999, Dodd married Jackie Marie Clegg, a native of Orem, Utah, former longtime aide to Senator Jake Garn, Republican of Utah, and former official at the Export-Import Bank of the United States. The marriage joined Dodd&#x27;s family of New England Catholic Democrats with Clegg&#x27;s family of LDS (Mormon) Republicans from the Utah Valley. The couple has two daughters, Grace (born September 2001) and Christina Dodd (born May 2005).

Dodd was raised as a Catholic and attends Mass. In 2007, Dodd stated that his Catholic faith taught him &quot;to promote the common good&quot; and &quot;do everything possible to provide a safety net for the most vulnerable.&quot; Dodd also credited his Catholic background with his decision to join the Peace Corps. Dodd&#x27;s two children were baptized in the Catholic tradition and blessed in the Mormon tradition.

He made a brief cameo appearance as himself in the political satire film &quot;Dave&quot; (1993).

On July 31, 2009, Dodd announced he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer; his aides said that it was at an early, treatable stage and Dodd would undergo surgery during the Senate August recess. The surgery, held at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, was successful.

He is the godfather of actress Christy Carlson Romano.

==Awards and honors==
In 2008, Dodd received the Washington Office on Latin America&#x27;s Human Rights Award.

In 2014, Dodd received The Media Institute&#x27;s Freedom of Speech Award.

In 2016, Dodd received the Brass Ring Award from the United Friends of the Children, a Los Angeles charitable organization, in recognition of his work on behalf of children while in the Senate.

In 2025, Dodd received the Presidential Citizens Medal, the second highest civilian award, from President Joe Biden.

<text>An axion () is a hypothetical elementary particle originally theorized in 1978 independently by Frank Wilczek and Steven Weinberg as the Goldstone boson of Peccei–Quinn theory, which had been proposed in 1977 to solve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). If axions exist and have low mass within a specific range, they are of interest as a possible component of cold dark matter.

== History ==
=== Strong CP problem ===
As shown by Gerard &#x27;t Hooft, strong interactions of the standard model, QCD, possess a non-trivial vacuum structure that in principle permits violation of the combined symmetries of charge conjugation and parity, collectively known as CP. Together with effects generated by weak interactions, the effective periodic strong CP-violating term, , appears as a Standard Model input – its value is not predicted by the theory, but must be measured. However, large CP-violating interactions originating from QCD would induce a large electric dipole moment (EDM) for the neutron. Experimental constraints on the unobserved EDM implies CP violation from QCD must be extremely tiny and thus must itself be extremely small. Since could have any value between 0 and 2, this presents a &quot;naturalness&quot; problem for the standard model. Why should this parameter find itself so close to zero? (Or, why should QCD find itself CP-preserving?) This question constitutes what is known as the strong CP problem.

=== Prediction ===
In 1977, Roberto Peccei and Helen Quinn postulated a more elegant solution to the strong CP problem, the Peccei–Quinn mechanism. The idea is to effectively promote to a field. This is accomplished by adding a new global symmetry (called a Peccei–Quinn (PQ) symmetry) that becomes spontaneously broken. This results in a new particle, as shown independently by Frank Wilczek and Steven Weinberg, that fills the role of , naturally relaxing the CP-violation parameter to zero. Wilczek named this new hypothesized particle the &quot;axion&quot; after a brand of laundry detergent because it &quot;cleaned up&quot; a problem, while Weinberg called it &quot;the higglet&quot;. Weinberg later agreed to adopt Wilczek&#x27;s name for the particle. Because it has a non-zero mass, the axion is a pseudo-Nambu–Goldstone boson.

== Axion dark matter ==
QCD effects produce an effective periodic potential in which the axion field moves. Expanding the potential about one of its minima, one finds that the product of the axion mass with the axion decay constant is determined by the topological susceptibility of the QCD vacuum. An axion with mass much less than 60 keV is long-lived and weakly interacting: A perfect dark matter candidate.

The oscillations of the axion field about the minimum of the effective potential, the so-called misalignment mechanism, generate a cosmological population of cold axions with an abundance depending on the mass of the axion. With a mass above 5 μeV/2 ( times the electron mass) axions could account for dark matter, and thus be both a dark-matter candidate and a solution to the strong CP problem. If inflation occurs at a low scale and lasts sufficiently long, the axion mass can be as low as 1 peV/2.

There are two distinct scenarios in which the axion field begins its evolution, depending on the following two conditions:
Broadly speaking, one of the two possible scenarios outlined in the two following subsections occurs:

=== Pre-inflationary scenario ===
If both (a) and (b) are satisfied, cosmic inflation selects one patch of the Universe within which the spontaneous breaking of the PQ symmetry leads to a homogeneous value of the initial value of the axion field. In this &quot;pre-inflationary&quot; scenario, topological defects are inflated away and do not contribute to the axion energy density. However, other bounds that come from isocurvature modes severely constrain this scenario, which require a relatively low-energy scale of inflation to be viable.

=== Post-inflationary scenario ===
If at least one of the conditions (a) or (b) is violated, the axion field takes different values within patches that are initially out of causal contact, but that today populate the volume enclosed by our Hubble horizon. In this scenario, isocurvature fluctuations in the PQ field randomise the axion field, with no preferred value in the power spectrum.

The proper treatment in this scenario is to solve numerically the equation of motion of the PQ field in an expanding Universe, in order to capture all features coming from the misalignment mechanism, including the contribution from topological defects like &quot;axionic&quot; strings and domain walls. An axion mass estimate between 0.05 and 1.50 meV was reported by Borsanyi et al. (2016). The result was calculated by simulating the formation of axions during the post-inflation period on a supercomputer.

Progress in the late 2010s in determining the present abundance of a KSVZ-type axion using numerical simulations lead to values between 0.02 and 0.1 meV, although these results have been challenged by the details on the power spectrum of emitted axions from strings.

== Phenomenology of the axion field ==
=== Searches ===
The axion models originally proposed by Wilczek and by Weinberg chose axion coupling strengths that were so strong that they would have already been detected in prior experiments. It had been thought that the Peccei-Quinn mechanism for solving the strong CP problem required such large couplings. However, it was soon realized that &quot;invisible axions&quot; with much smaller couplings also work. Two such classes of models are known in the literature as (Kim–Shifman–Vainshtein– and (Dine–Fischler––

The very weakly coupled axion is also very light, because axion couplings and mass are proportional. Satisfaction with &quot;invisible axions&quot; changed when it was shown that any very light axion would have been overproduced in the early universe and therefore must be excluded.

=== Maxwell&#x27;s equations with axion modifications ===
Pierre Sikivie computed how Maxwell&#x27;s equations are modified in the presence of an axion in 1983. He showed that these axions could be detected on Earth by converting them to photons, using a strong magnetic field, motivating a number of experiments. For example, the Axion Dark Matter Experiment converts axion dark matter to microwave photons, the CERN Axion Solar Telescope converts axions produced in the Sun&#x27;s core to X-rays, and other experiments search for axions produced in laser light. As of the early 2020s, there are dozens of proposed or ongoing experiments searching for axion dark matter.

The equations of axion electrodynamics are typically written in &quot;natural units&quot;, where the reduced Planck constant formula_1, speed of light formula_2, and permittivity of free space formula_3 all reduce to 1 when expressed in these &quot;natural units&quot;. In this unit system, the electrodynamic equations are:

Above, a dot above a variable denotes its time derivative; the dot spaced between variables is the vector dot product; the factor formula_4 is the axion-to-photon coupling constant rendered in &quot;natural units&quot;.

Alternative forms of these equations have been proposed, which imply completely different physical signatures. For example, Visinelli wrote a set of equations that imposed duality symmetry, assuming the existence of magnetic monopoles. However, these alternative formulations are less theoretically motivated, and in many cases cannot even be derived from an action.

=== Analogous effect for topological insulators ===
A term analogous to the one that would be added to Maxwell&#x27;s equations to account for axions also appears in recent (2008) theoretical models for topological insulators giving an effective axion description of the electrodynamics of these materials.

This term leads to several interesting predicted properties including a quantized magnetoelectric effect. Evidence for this effect has been given in THz spectroscopy experiments performed at the Johns Hopkins University on quantum regime thin film topological insulators developed at Rutgers University.

In 2019, a team at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Physics of Solids published their detection of an axion insulator phase of a Weyl semimetal material. In the axion insulator phase, the material has an axion-like quasiparticle – an excitation of electrons that behave together as an axion – and its discovery demonstrates the consistency of axion electrodynamics as a description of the interaction of axion-like particles with electromagnetic fields. In this way, the discovery of axion-like quasiparticles in axion insulators provides motivation to use axion electrodynamics to search for the axion itself.

== Experiments ==
Despite not yet having been found, the axion has been well studied for over 40 years, giving time for physicists to develop insight into axion effects that might be detected. Several experimental searches for axions are presently underway; most exploit axions&#x27; expected slight interaction with photons in strong magnetic fields. Axions are also one of the few remaining plausible candidates for dark matter particles, and might be discovered in some dark matter experiments.


=== Direct conversion in a magnetic field ===
Several experiments search for astrophysical axions by the Primakoff effect, which converts axions to photons and vice versa in electromagnetic fields.
The Axion Dark Matter Experiment (ADMX) at the University of Washington uses a strong magnetic field to detect the possible weak conversion of axions to microwaves. ADMX searches the galactic dark matter halo for axions resonant with a cold microwave cavity. ADMX has excluded optimistic axion models in the 1.9–3.53 μeV range. From 2013 to 2018 a series of upgrades were done and it is taking new data, including at 4.9–6.2 μeV. In December 2021 it excluded the 3.3–4.2 μeV range for the KSVZ model.

Other experiments of this type include DMRadio, HAYSTAC, CULTASK, and ORGAN. HAYSTAC completed the first scanning run of a haloscope above 20 μeV in the late 2010s.

=== Polarized light in a magnetic field ===
The Italian PVLAS experiment searches for polarization changes of light propagating in a magnetic field. The concept was first put forward in 1986 by Luciano Maiani, Roberto Petronzio and Emilio Zavattini. A rotation claim in 2006 was excluded by an upgraded setup. An optimized search began in 2014.

=== Light shining through walls ===
Another technique is so called &quot;light shining through walls&quot;, where light passes through an intense magnetic field to convert photons into axions, which then pass through metal and are reconstituted as photons by another magnetic field on the other side of the barrier. Experiments by BFRS and a team led by Rizzo ruled out an axion cause. GammeV saw no events, reported in a 2008 Physics Review Letter. ALPS I conducted similar runs, setting new constraints in 2010; ALPS II began collecting data in May 2023. OSQAR found no signal, limiting coupling, and will continue.

=== Astrophysical axion searches ===
Axion-like bosons could have a signature in astrophysical settings. In particular, several works have proposed axion-like particles as a solution to the apparent transparency of the Universe to TeV photons. It has also been demonstrated that, in the large magnetic fields threading the atmospheres of compact astrophysical objects (e.g., magnetars), photons will convert much more efficiently. This would in turn give rise to distinct absorption-like features in the spectra detectable by early 21st century telescopes. A new (2009) promising means is looking for quasi-particle refraction in systems with strong magnetic gradients. In particular, the refraction will lead to beam splitting in the radio light curves of highly magnetized pulsars and allow much greater sensitivities than currently achievable. The International Axion Observatory (IAXO) is a proposed fourth generation helioscope.

Axions can resonantly convert into photons in the magnetospheres of neutron stars. The emerging photons lie in the GHz frequency range and can be potentially picked up in radio detectors, leading to a sensitive probe of the axion parameter space. This strategy has been used to constrain the axion–photon coupling in the 5–11 μeV mass range, by re-analyzing existing data from the Green Bank Telescope and the Effelsberg 100 m Radio Telescope. A novel, alternative strategy consists in detecting the transient signal from the encounter between a neutron star and an axion minicluster in the Milky Way.

Axions can be produced in the Sun&#x27;s core when X-rays scatter in strong electric fields. The CAST solar telescope is underway, and has set limits on coupling to photons and electrons. Axions may also be produced within neutron stars by nucleon–nucleon bremsstrahlung. The subsequent decay of axions to gamma rays allows constraints on the axion mass to be placed from observations of neutron stars in gamma-rays using the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. From an analysis of four neutron stars, Berenji et al. (2016) obtained a 95% confidence interval upper limit on the axion mass of 0.079 eV. In 2021 it has been also suggested that a reported excess of hard X-ray emission from a system of neutron stars known as the magnificent seven could be explained as axion emission.

In 2016, a theoretical team from Massachusetts Institute of Technology devised a possible way of detecting axions using a strong magnetic field that need be no stronger than that produced in an MRI scanning machine. It would show variation, a slight wavering, that is linked to the mass of the axion. Results from the ensuing experiment published in 2021 reported no evidence of axions in the mass range from 4.1x10−10 to 8.27x10−9 eV.

In 2022 the polarized light measurements of Messier 87* by the Event Horizon Telescope were used to constrain the mass of the axion assuming that hypothetical clouds of axions could form around a black hole, rejecting the approximate – range of mass values.

=== Searches for resonance effects ===
Resonance effects may be evident in Josephson junctions from a supposed high flux of axions from the galactic halo with mass of 110 μeV and density compared to the implied dark matter density , indicating said axions would not have enough mass to be the sole component of dark matter. The ORGAN experiment plans to conduct a direct test of this result via the haloscope method.

=== Dark matter recoil searches ===
Dark matter cryogenic detectors have searched for electron recoils that would indicate axions. CDMS published in 2009 and EDELWEISS set coupling and mass limits in 2013. UORE and XMASS also set limits on solar axions in 2013. XENON100 used a 225-day run to set the best coupling limits to date and exclude some parameters.

=== Nuclear spin precession ===
While Schiff&#x27;s theorem states that a static nuclear electric dipole moment (EDM) does not produce atomic and molecular EDMs, the axion induces an oscillating nuclear EDM that oscillates at the Larmor frequency. If this nuclear EDM oscillation frequency is in resonance with an external electric field, a precession in the nuclear spin rotation occurs. This precession can be measured using precession magnetometry and if detected, would be evidence for Axions.

An experiment using this technique is the Cosmic Axion Spin Precession Experiment (CASPEr).

=== Searches at particle colliders ===
Axions may also be produced at colliders, in particular in electron-positron collisions as well as in ultra-peripheral heavy ion collisions at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, reinterpreting the light-by-light scattering process. Those searches are sensitive for rather large axion masses between 100 MeV/c2 and hundreds of GeV/c2. Assuming a coupling of axions to the Higgs boson, searches for anomalous Higgs boson decays into two axions can theoretically provide even stronger limits.

== Disputed detections ==
It was reported in 2014 that evidence for axions may have been detected as a seasonal variation in observed X-ray emission that would be expected from conversion in the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field of axions streaming from the Sun. Studying 15 years of data by the European Space Agency&#x27;s XMM-Newton observatory, a research group at Leicester University noticed a seasonal variation for which no conventional explanation could be found. One potential explanation for the variation, described as &quot;plausible&quot; by the senior author of the paper, is the known seasonal variation in visibility to XMM-Newton of the sunward magnetosphere in which X-rays may be produced by axions from the Sun&#x27;s core.

This interpretation of the seasonal variation is disputed by two Italian researchers, who identify flaws in the arguments of the Leicester group that are said to rule out an interpretation in terms of axions. Most importantly, the scattering in angle assumed by the Leicester group to be caused by magnetic field gradients during the photon production, necessary to allow the X-rays to enter the detector that cannot point directly at the sun, would dissipate the flux so much that the probability of detection would be negligible.

In 2013, Christian Beck suggested that axions might be detectable in Josephson junctions; and in 2014, he argued that a signature, consistent with a mass ≈110 μeV, had in fact been observed in several preexisting experiments.

In 2020, the XENON1T experiment at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Italy reported a result suggesting the discovery of solar axions. The results were not significant at the 5-sigma level required for confirmation, and other explanations of the data were possible though less likely. New observations made in July 2022 after the observatory upgrade to XENONnT discarded the excess, thus ending the possibility of new particle discovery.

== Properties ==
=== Predictions ===
One theory of axions relevant to cosmology had predicted that they would have no electric charge, a very small mass in the range from to , and very low interaction cross-sections for strong and weak forces. Because of their properties, axions would interact only minimally with ordinary matter. Axions would also change to and from photons in magnetic fields.

=== Cosmological implications ===
The properties of the axion, such as the axion mass, decay constant, and abundance, all have implications for cosmology.

Inflation theory suggests that if they exist, axions would be created abundantly during the Big Bang. Because of a unique coupling to the instanton field of the primordial universe (the &quot;misalignment mechanism&quot;), an effective dynamical friction is created during the acquisition of mass, following cosmic inflation. This robs all such primordial axions of their kinetic energy.

Ultralight axion (ULA) with is a kind of scalar field dark matter that seems to solve the small scale problems of CDM. A single ULA with a GUT scale decay constant provides the correct relic density without fine-tuning.

Axions would also have stopped interaction with normal matter at a different moment after the Big Bang than other more massive dark particles. The lingering effects of this difference could perhaps be calculated and observed astronomically.

If axions have low mass, thus preventing other decay modes (since there are no lighter particles to decay into), the low coupling constant thus predicts that the axion is not scattered out of its state despite its small mass so that the universe would be filled with a very cold Bose–Einstein condensate of primordial axions. Hence, axions could plausibly explain the dark matter problem of physical cosmology. Observational studies are underway, but they are not yet sufficiently sensitive to probe the mass regions if they are the solution to the dark matter problem with the fuzzy dark matter region starting to be probed via superradiance. High mass axions of the kind searched for by Jain and Singh (2007) would not persist in the modern universe. Moreover, if axions exist, scatterings with other particles in the thermal bath of the early universe unavoidably produce a population of hot axions.

Low mass axions could have additional structure at the galactic scale. If they continuously fall into galaxies from the intergalactic medium, they would be denser in &quot;caustic&quot; rings, just as the stream of water in a continuously flowing fountain is thicker at its peak. The gravitational effects of these rings on galactic structure and rotation might then be observable. Other cold dark matter theoretical candidates, such as WIMPs and MACHOs, could also form such rings, but because such candidates are fermionic and thus experience friction or scattering among themselves, the rings would be less sharply defined.

João G. Rosa and Thomas W. Kephart suggested that axion clouds formed around unstable primordial black holes might initiate a chain of reactions that radiate electromagnetic waves, allowing their detection. When adjusting the mass of the axions to explain dark matter, the pair discovered that the value would also explain the luminosity and wavelength of fast radio bursts, being a possible origin for both phenomena. In 2022 a similar hypothesis was used to constrain the mass of the axion from data of M87*.

In 2020, it was proposed that the axion field might actually have influenced the evolution of the early Universe by creating more imbalance between the amounts of matter and antimatter – which possibly resolves the baryon asymmetry problem.

=== Supersymmetry ===
In supersymmetric theories the axion has both a scalar and a fermionic superpartner. The fermionic superpartner of the axion is called the axino, the scalar superpartner is called the saxion or dilaton. They are all bundled in a chiral superfield.

The axino has been predicted to be the lightest supersymmetric particle in such a model. In part due to this property, it is also considered a candidate for dark matter.

<doc id="335056" wikidata="Q734330" url="?curid=335056" title="Saxby Chambliss">
<text>Clarence Saxby Chambliss (; born November 10, 1943) is an American lawyer and retired politician who was a United States Senator from Georgia from 2003 to 2015. A member of the Republican Party, he previously served as a U.S. Representative from 1995 to 2003.

During his House tenure, Chambliss chaired the House Intelligence Subcommittee on Terrorism and Homeland Security. This subcommittee oversaw investigations of the intelligence community following the September 11 attacks in 2001.

Chambliss was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 2002, defeating Democratic incumbent Max Cleland. As a senator, he chaired the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry during the 109th Congress (2005–2007). During the 112th Congress (2011–2012), he was the ranking Republican on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. In December 2011, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; named Chambliss as one of the Best Leaders of 2011 for his attempts to craft a bipartisan deficit reduction package. Chambliss was re-elected to the Senate in 2008, but did not seek reelection in 2014.

==Early life and education==
Chambliss was born in Warrenton, North Carolina, the son of Emma Baker (née Anderson) and Alfred Parker Chambliss, Jr., an Episcopal priest. He graduated from C.E. Byrd High School in Shreveport, Louisiana, in 1961. He attended Louisiana Tech University from 1961 to 1962 and earned a Bachelor of Business Administration from the University of Georgia’s Terry College of Business in 1966, working his way through college at a bakery in Athens. He received his Juris Doctor from the University of Tennessee College of Law in 1968. He is a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity.

During the Vietnam War, Chambliss received student deferments and was also given a medical deferment (1-Y) for bad knees due to a football injury.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
Chambliss was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1994 as one of the new conservative Republican congressmen whose elections caused the party to gain a majority in both houses of Congress. A long-time Congressman and fellow Georgian, Newt Gingrich, was the leader of the movement, and Chambliss and the other Republicans elected that year are known as the Class of &#x27;94.

Chambliss was elected from the Macon-based 8th District, after six-term incumbent J. Roy Rowland retired. He was elected with 63% of the vote—an unexpectedly large margin since the 8th had never elected a Republican. He faced a tough re-election fight in 1996 against Macon attorney Jim Wiggins, but breezed to reelection in 1998 and 2000. In the latter contest, he faced a reasonably well-financed challenger in former Macon mayor Jim Marshall, but turned back this challenge fairly easily with almost 59 percent of the vote.

During his four terms in the House, Chambliss served on the United States House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and chaired the House Intelligence Subcommittee on Terrorism and Homeland Security.

Less than a month after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the House Intelligence Subcommittee on Terrorism and Homeland Security, which Chambliss chaired, investigated intelligence issues related to the attacks. The committee&#x27;s investigation resulted in the first comprehensive report detailing critical shortfalls within the United States intelligence community&#x27;s performance and technological capabilities.

Chambliss was criticized for remarks he made during a November 19, 2001 meeting with first responders in Valdosta, Georgia, where he said that homeland security would be improved by turning the sheriff loose to &quot;arrest every Muslim that crosses the state line.&quot; Chambliss apologized for the remarks.

In 2006, Chambliss was among several congressional Republicans and Democrats who returned campaign donations from Jack Abramoff.

==U.S. Senate==
===Elections===
====2002 race====
Upon urging from Karl Rove and the Bush administration who viewed the Democratic party of Georgia as vulnerable, Chambliss ran for the Senate in 2002, facing freshman Democratic incumbent Max Cleland. During the campaign, Chambliss ran an advertisement against Cleland, a decorated Vietnam War veteran who lost three limbs during the war, in which Cleland was described as weak on defense and homeland security. Chambliss received criticism from Democrats and Republicans for this advertisement. Republican Sens. John McCain and Chuck Hagel complained to the Republican National Committee about the advertisement, and it was taken down.

Chambliss won the election, receiving 53 percent of the votes to Cleland&#x27;s 46 percent.

====2008 race====

On November 4, 2008, Chambliss received 49.8% of the vote, while Democratic challenger Jim Martin received 47% and Libertarian Allen Buckley received 3% of the vote.

Since no candidate exceeded 50% of the vote, a runoff election between Chambliss and Martin was held on December 2, 2008.

During the run-off period, Chambliss received a subpoena regarding the investigation of a lawsuit against Imperial Sugar that claims that Imperial &quot;wrongfully&quot; failed to remove hazards that caused the disaster of a Savannah-based sugar refinery that exploded on February 7, 2008. Chambliss was accused of &quot;harassing&quot; a former sugar company executive. In a statement, Chambliss stated that he sympathized with the families affected by the explosion and had referred the matter to Senate lawyers. When he was subpoenaed to testify in the case, Chambliss claimed &quot;legislative immunity.&quot;

Chambliss defeated Martin 57% to 43% in the runoff election.

===Tenure===
Chambliss was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 2002. As a senator, he chaired the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry during the 109th Congress (2005–2007). During the 112th Congress (2011–2012), he was the ranking Republican on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.

Although Chambliss had a conservative voting record, he participated in bipartisan legislation—such as the 2007 Farm Bill, the bipartisan immigration reform (led by John McCain and Ted Kennedy) in 2007 and the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. He was also the Republican leader of the Gang of 10, a bipartisan group which worked to create a compromise surrounding the energy policy of the United States. In December 2011, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; named Chambliss as one of the Best Leaders of 2011 for his attempts to craft a bipartisan deficit reduction package.

On March 6, 2013, Chambliss was one of 12 Senators invited to a private dinner hosted, and personally paid for, by President Obama at The Jefferson Hotel. That same night, Chambliss participated in Rand Paul&#x27;s filibuster over the government&#x27;s use of lethal drone strikes—forcing the Senate to delay the expected confirmation of John O. Brennan to lead the Central Intelligence Agency.

In April 2013, Chambliss was one of forty-six senators to vote against a bill which would have expanded background checks for all firearms buyers. Chambliss voted with 40 Republicans and five Democrats to stop the passage of the bill.

Chambliss received bipartisan criticism in 2013 after discussing the &quot;hormone level created by nature&quot; as a possible cause of sexual assault in the military.

In January 2014, Chambliss signed an amicus brief in support of Senator Ron Johnson&#x27;s legal challenge against the U.S. Office of Personnel Management&#x27;s Affordable Care Act ruling.

Chambliss&#x27;s son, Bo, was a registered lobbyist for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Bo Chambliss lobbied on commodity futures trading issues that fell under legislative jurisdiction of the Senate Agriculture Committee, of which the Senator was a member. Sen. Chambliss&#x27;s office enacted a policy that prevented Bo Chambliss from lobbying the Senator or his staff.

Chambliss did not seek reelection in 2014. Days after his retirement from the Senate in 2015, it was announced he was joining DLA Piper as a partner.

==Personal life==

Chambliss suffered a minor stroke in December 2020.

<text>The United States is a charter member of the United Nations and one of five permanent members of the UN Security Council.

The United States boasts the headquarters of the United Nations, which includes the usual meeting place of the General Assembly in New York City, on the north east coast of the country. The United States is the largest provider of financial contributions to the United Nations, providing 27.89 percent of the UN assessed peacekeeping budget of $6.38 billion for fiscal year 2020 (China and Japan contributed 15.2 percent and 8.5 percent, respectively). The assessed peacekeeping budget is separate from voluntary contributions and the assessed regular budget. The assessed regular budget of the UN for fiscal year 2022 in $3.12 billion. From July 2016 to June 2017, 28.6 percent of the budget used for peacekeeping operations was provided by the United States. The United States had a pivotal role in establishing the UN.

== Role in establishing the UN ==
The UN is an outgrowth of the Atlantic Charter. It appeared in the Declaration by United Nations on January 1, 1942, in which 26 nations pledged to continue fighting the Axis powers.

Their main inspiration was the League of Nations; however, their goals were to rectify the League&#x27;s imperfections in order to create an organization that would be “the primary vehicle for maintaining peace and stability.” Roosevelt&#x27;s main role was to convince the different allies, especially Winston Churchill of the United Kingdom and Joseph Stalin of the Soviet Union, to join the new organization. The negotiations mainly took place during the Dumbarton Oaks Conference and the Yalta Conference, where the three world leaders tried to reach a consensus concerning the United Nations&#x27; structure, purposes and principles. “Roosevelt saw the United Nations as the crowning achievement of his political career.” Roosevelt&#x27;s envoy Wendell Willkie played a key role in promoting the idea of the United States joining the new organization, publishing &quot;One World&quot; in April 1943. In September 1943, 81 percent of Americans - up from 63 percent in February - supported joining a &quot;union of nations&quot; after the war.

In 1945, representatives from 50 countries met in San Francisco for the United Nations Conference on International Organization. They deliberated on proposals that had been drafted by representatives of the Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference between August and October 1944.
Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin reviewed the Dumbarton Oaks proposal during the Yalta Conference in February 1945. The purpose of the conference was to discuss post-war settlements and to reach a final agreement concerning “the UN’s structure and membership and set the date of the San Francisco organizing conference.” The world leaders eventually agreed on Roosevelt&#x27;s proposal to give certain members a veto power so “that the Organization could take no important action without their joint consent.” Though the veto power question created a lot of disagreement among the different signatories, its inclusion in the charter was never a matter of negotiation for Roosevelt and his allies. Finally, during the Yalta conference, Stalin agreed to make the USSR a member of the United Nations.

An important American contribution, prior to the formation of the United Nations, was made at the Bretton Woods Conference. This conference took place in 1944 and its goal was “to create a new international monetary and trade regime that was stable and predictable.” Over subsequent decades, this new system opened world markets and promoted a liberal economy. It was implemented through different institutions, such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which went on to work with the United Nations but remained independent from it.

On July 28, 1945, the United States Senate (as part of the 79th United States Congress) ratified the United Nations Charter by a vote of . (By comparison, the Senate had voted in favor of joining the League of Nations, short of the required two-thirds majority for ratification.) The United Nations officially came into existence on October 24, 1945, when all of the Permanent Five (the Republic of China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States) as well as a majority of other signatories had ratified the Charter.

The United Nations was the first international governmental organization to receive significant support from the United States. Its forerunner, the League of Nations, had been championed by Woodrow Wilson after World War I to prevent future conflicts. While it was supported by most nations of Europe, it was never ratified by the United States Congress due to the inability to reach a compromise regarding the Lodge Reservations or the Hitchcock Reservations.

Shortly after the establishment of the United Nations, the United States came into conflict with another member of the Security Council. Since the Soviet Union was a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, it had the power to veto any binding UN resolution. In fact, Soviet foreign minister and UN ambassador Vyacheslav Molotov used veto power twice as often as any other permanent member, earning him the title &quot;Mr. Veto&quot;.

Relations between the United States and the Soviet Union (later Russia) within the UN have evolved in step with the larger geopolitical situation between the two powers. While the Soviet Union was boycotting the Security Council and China&#x27;s seat was represented by U.S.-friendly Republic of China (instead of the communist People&#x27;s Republic of China which would replace the ROC in the UN in 1971), the U.S. and UN jointly condemned the invasion of South Korea by North Korean troops, leading to the UN sanctioned Korean War. Later, the U.S. persuaded all permanent members of the Security Council to authorize force against Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in 1991. This was a major step toward U.S. and Russian reconciliation after the end of the Cold War.

== Sources of conflict ==
Since 1991, the United States has been the world&#x27;s dominant military, economic, social, and political power (not to mention hosting the UN Headquarters itself in New York City); the United Nations was not designed for such a unipolar world with a single superpower, and conflicts between an ascendant U.S. and other UN members have increased.

Conflict between the U.S. and the UN predates the collapse of the Soviet Union. In 1971, the UN adopted Resolution 2758—which affected the admission of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the removal of the Republic of China—despite objections by the U.S. government (see China and the United Nations). The U.S. government changed its own China policy shortly afterward, however, so the conflict between the UN and US foreign policy was short-lived.

The U.S. government&#x27;s repeated opposition to Arab military actions has created much more tension between the U.S. government and the United Nations. The General Assembly Resolution 3379 (determining that Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination) of 1975 was strongly opposed by U.S. officials. In 1991, the General Assembly adopted Resolution 4686, which effectively negated Resolution 3379. Use of its veto power to prevent the Security Council from issuing resolutions condemning Israeli military action has frequently divided the U.S. from the Soviet Union, China and France in the Security Council; since 1989, the U.S. government has dissented against Security Council resolutions on 12 occasions out of 17 total instances when a permanent member vetoed. Of these 12 occasions, only two related to issues other than the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. In 2009, the U.S. government abstained from Security Council Resolution 1860, which called for a halt to Israel&#x27;s military response to Hamas rocket attacks, and the opening of the border crossings into the Gaza Strip.

Under the Reagan administration, the U.S. withdrew from UNESCO, and withheld its dues to encourage the UN to repeal Resolution 3379, which it did in 1991. The U.S. was—and continues to be—the member state levied most heavily by the UN, so U.S. policymakers expected this strategy to be an effective way to oppose Soviet and Arab influence over the UN. When the UN repealed Resolution 3379, the U.S. resumed dues payments, but not before the U.S. had accumulated significant and controversial arrears.

== Public opinion ==
Polls have repeatedly gauged public opinion in the U.S. regarding the UN. In the 1950s and 1960s more supportive attitudes were found among the college-educated, more prosperous, and the politically better informed. Distrust was more common among other groups. According to Gregory G. Holyk, &quot;Approval of UN performance dropped to an all-time low between 2003 and 2007, after the contentious debate over the use of force against Iraq. Nonetheless, support for the UN has remained strong because the U.S. public differentiates between criticism of UN performance and support for the general purpose and aims of the UN.&quot;

== Arrears ==
The UN has always had problems with members refusing to pay the assessment levied upon them under the United Nations Charter, but the most significant refusal in recent times has been that of the United States.

After prolonged negotiations, the U.S. and the UN negotiated an agreement whereby the United States would pay a large part of the money it owes, and in exchange the UN would reduce the assessment rate ceiling from 25% to 22%. The reduction in the assessment rate ceiling was among the reforms contained in the United Nations Reform Act of 1999 or Helms-Biden Act, which links payment of $926 million in U.S. arrears to the UN and other international organizations to a series of reform benchmarks.

Of the U.S. arrears to the UN totaling over $1.3 billion, $612 million was payable under Helms-Biden. The remaining $700 million resulted from various legislative and policy withholdings.

Under Helms-Biden, the U.S. paid $100 million in arrears to the UN in December 1999; release of the next $582 million awaited a legislative revision to Helms-Biden, necessary because the benchmark requiring a 25 percent peacekeeping assessment rate ceiling was not quite achieved. The U.S. also sought elimination of the legislated 25 percent cap on U.S. peacekeeping payments in effect since 1995, which continued to generate additional UN arrears. Of the final $244 million under Helms-Biden, $30 million was payable to the UN and $214 million to other international organizations.

In February 2001, Congress authorized the second Helms-Biden payment, but because of an eight-month delay in appropriations, the U.N. chose not to re-elect the United States to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. Following the September 11 attacks, on 6 October 2001, Bush signed the second Helms-Biden appropriation into law and in March 2002, the U.S. was voted back onto the commission. In October 2002, Congress lifted the 25% cap on peacekeeping assessments and in November 2002, the U.S. made the final Helms-Biden appropriation.

== The Iraq War, Saddam Hussein, and WMDs ==
Further conflict between the U.S. and some UN members arose in 2002 and 2003 over the issue of Iraq. George W. Bush maintained that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had not fulfilled the obligations he had entered into at the end of the Gulf War in 1991, namely to rid Iraq of all weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and to renounce their further use. A series of inspections by the IAEA failed to find conclusive evidence that proved allegations that Iraq was continuing to develop or harbour such weapons. The findings were conveyed by the leading weapons inspector, Hans Blix, who noted Iraq&#x27;s failure to cooperate with the inspections on several counts. The U.S. replied by saying that the responsibility of proof of disarmament was upon Iraq, not on the UN or the U.S.

In November 2002, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1441, giving Iraq an ultimatum to co-operate in disarmament within an unstated timeframe of a few months. However, in March 2003, the U.S., supported by fifty countries (including the United Kingdom, Spain, Australia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, the Netherlands and Poland) which the Bush administration referred to as the &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; launched military operations against Iraq. On April 9, Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime was overthrown and Iraq was placed under occupation, marked by the fall of Baghdad. The U.S. argued that this action was authorized by Resolution 1441, since Iraq had failed to comply by co-operating fully in the identification and destruction of its weapons programs, and since Resolution 1441 promised &#x27;serious consequences&#x27; for lack of full compliance and achievement of its objective.

Other countries, led by France, Germany and Russia, maintained that Resolution 1441 did not authorize the use of force without passage of a further Resolution. French President Jacques Chirac stated &quot;My position is that, whatever the circumstances, France will vote &#x27;no&#x27; because this evening it considers that it is not necessary to make war to achieve the stated goal of the disarmament of Iraq&quot;.

Rightly or wrongly the &quot;this evening&quot; qualification was ignored, perhaps because the implications of its English translation are ambiguous. The statement was widely interpreted in the English-speaking world as meaning that France would exercise its right as a Permanent Member of the Security Council to veto any resolution at any time (&quot;whatever the circumstances&quot;) to use force against Iraq.

Following the overthrow of the former Iraqi government, the Iraq Survey Group led an exhaustive search of Iraq for WMD. Ultimately, while over 500 &quot;degraded&quot; chemical warheads were found, no deployable WMD of any kind were found and all WMD production facilities had been found to be inactive since 1991.

== Reform of the United Nations ==
The United States Congress has shown particular concern with reforms related to UN effectiveness and efficiency. In November 2004, the bill H.R. 4818 mandated the creation of a bipartisan Task Force to report to Congress on how to make the UN more effective in realizing the goals of its Charter. The Task Force came into being in January 2005, co-chaired by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Senate Majority Leader, George J. Mitchell. In June 2005, the task force released &quot;American Interests and UN Reform: Report of the Task Force on the United Nations,&quot; with numerous recommendations on how to improve the UN.

On June 17, 2005, the United States House of Representatives passed the United Nations Reform Act of 2005 to slash funds to the UN in half by 2008 if it does not meet certain criteria. This reflects years of complaints about anti-American and anti-Israeli bias in the UN, particularly the exclusion of Israel from many decision-making organizations. The U.S. is estimated to contribute about 27.89% of the UN&#x27;s yearly budget due to the UN&#x27;s ability-to-pay scale, making this bill potentially devastating to the United Nations. The Bush administration and several former U.S. ambassadors to the UN have warned that this may only strengthen anti-American sentiment around the world and serve to hurt current UN reform movements. The bill passed the House in June 2005, and a parallel bill was introduced in the Senate by Gordon H. Smith on July 13, 2005. However, a number of leading Senate Republicans objected to the requirement that the U.S. contributions be halved if the UN failed to meet all of the criteria. The UN Management, Personnel, and Policy Reform Act of 2005 (S. 1394), introduced on July 12, 2005 into the Senate by Sen. Norm Coleman [R-MN] and Sen. Richard Lugar [R-IN], called for similar reforms but left the withholding of dues to the discretion of the President. Neither piece of legislation made it into law.

== Visa refusal controversy ==
In April 2007, the U.S. government refused to give an entry visa to the foreign minister of the &quot;de facto&quot; independent Republic of Abkhazia (&quot;de jure&quot; part of Georgia) Sergei Shamba who was due to speak at the UN headquarters in New York City. The incident caused an international dispute as Russian Permanent Representative Vitaly Churkin accused the U.S. of not letting one side of the conflict speak before UN. Security Council president, British Ambassador Emyr Jones Parry, backed the Russian demand for Shamba&#x27;s visa. But the U.S. Ambassador, Alejandro Daniel Wolff, accused the Russian side of “a mischievous effort” to raise “false analogies” between Abkhazia and Kosovo, thus “complicating the discussion.” The U.S. stated that such airport to UNHQ visa access was not guaranteed to countries seeking international recognition; Kosovo president Fatmir Sejdiu had been given a visa. Sergei Shamba himself described the situation as &quot;dual standards&quot;.

== Future ==

In the US, complaints about the UN surface regularly in the domestic mainstream media. Some critics who oppose international constraints on US foreign policy contend that the US should withdraw from the UN, claiming that the United States is better equipped to manage the global order unilaterally. More frequently, critics argue that the UN should be reformed to bring it more in line with US policy and leadership.

Despite criticisms, the majority of Americans (88%) support active engagement in the United Nations, as evidenced by a non-partisan poll conducted after the 2016 election.
While most agree that the UN could be improved, Noam Chomsky, a leading critic of U.S. foreign policy, proposes that measures such as the US relinquishing its veto power in the Security Council and submitting to the rulings of the International Court of Justice could significantly improve the UN&#x27;s ability to foster the growth of democracy and promote global peace and the protection of human rights. However, some American organizations and individuals, such as the John Birch Society and Wayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association of America, oppose the United Nations on the basis of its perceived failures or alleged interference with domestic affairs. LaPierre wrote the book &quot;The Global War on Your Guns,&quot; in which he alerts the U.S. to the supposed threat of the Arms Trade Treaty.

When the United States Government released its National Security Strategy.pdf for 2010 in May 2010, this quote was found embedded on the 46th page in regards to the United Nations:

&quot;Enhance Cooperation with and Strengthen the United Nations: We are enhancing our coordination with the U.N. and its agencies. We need a U.N. capable of fulfilling its founding purpose—maintaining international peace and security, promoting global cooperation, and advancing human rights. To this end, we are paying our bills. We are intensifying efforts with partners on and outside the U.N. Security Council to ensure timely, robust, and credible Council action to address threats to peace and security. We favor Security Council reform that enhances the U.N.’s overall performance, credibility, and legitimacy. Across the broader U.N. system we support reforms that promote effective and efficient leadership and management of the U.N.’s international civil service, and we are working with U.N. personnel and member states to strengthen the U.N.’s leadership and operational capacity in peacekeeping, humanitarian relief, post-disaster recovery, development assistance, and the promotion of human&#x27;s rights. And we are supporting new U.N. frameworks and capacities for combating transnational threats like proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, infectious disease, drug-trafficking, and counter terrorism.&quot;

On January 3, 2017, a bill entitled the American Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2017 (ASRA) was introduced in the House to withdraw the US from the U.N. This bill was nearly identical to the first such bill, the ASRA of 1997, introduced by Ron Paul. Since then, a version of the ASRA has been introduced in every congressional session. To date, each such attempt has been met with minimal congressional support and died in committee.

<text>Hypersensitivity (also called hypersensitivity reaction or intolerance) is an abnormal physiological condition in which there is an undesirable and adverse immune response to an antigen. It is an abnormality in the immune system that causes immune diseases including allergies and autoimmunity. It is caused by many types of particles and substances from the external environment or from within the body that are recognized by the immune cells as antigens. The immune reactions are usually referred to as an over-reaction of the immune system and they are often damaging and uncomfortable.

In 1963, Philip George Houthem Gell and Robin Coombs introduced a systematic classification of the different types of hypersensitivity based on the types of antigens and immune responses involved. According to this system, known as the Gell and Coombs classification or Gell-Coombs&#x27;s classification, there are four types of hypersensitivity, namely: type I, which is an Immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated immediate reaction; type II, an antibody-mediated reaction mainly involving IgG or IgM; type III, an immune complex-mediated reaction involving IgG, complement system and phagocytes; and type IV, a cytotoxic, cell-mediated, delayed hypersensitivity reaction involving T cells.

The first three types are considered immediate hypersensitivity reactions because they occur within 24 hours. The fourth type is considered a delayed hypersensitivity reaction because it usually occurs more than 12 hours after exposure to the allergen, with a maximal reaction time between 48 and 72 hours. Hypersensitivity is a common occurrence: it is estimated that about 15% of humans have at least one type during their lives, and has increased since the latter half of the 20th century.

==Gell and Coombs classification==
The Gell and Coombs classification of hypersensitivity is the most widely used, and distinguishes four types of immune response that result in bystander tissue damage.
== Type I hypersensitivity ==

=== Etiology ===

Type I hypersensitivity occurs as a result of exposure to an antigen. The antigens are proteins with a molecular weight ranging from 10 to 40 kDa. The response to the antigen occurs in two stages: the sensitization and the effect stage. In the &quot;sensitization&quot; stage, the host experiences an asymptomatic contact with the antigen. Subsequently, in the &quot;effect&quot; period, the pre-sensitized host is re-introduced to the antigen, which then leads to a type I anaphylactic or atopic immune response.

=== Types of antigens involved ===
* Food: nuts, eggs, soy, wheat, shellfish, etc.
* Animal source: bees, wasp, cats, insects, rats, etc.
* Environmental factors: dust mites, latex, pollen, mold, flowers smell, etc.
* Atopic diseases: allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis, dermatitis, etc.
* Medication-induced reactions: antibiotics

== Type II hypersensitivity ==

Type II hypersensitivity reaction refers to an antibody-mediated immune reaction in which antibodies (IgG or IgM) are directed against cellular or extracellular matrix antigens with the resultant cellular destruction, functional loss, or damage to tissues. The antigens may be for example glycoproteins on the cell membrane of erythrocytes that are key molecules that determine blood types. Depending on the chemical nature of the antigens, blood types have different levels of hypersensitivity; for instance, A and B are more antigenic than other antigens.

Damage can be accomplished via three different mechanisms:
* Antibody binding to cell surface receptors and altering its activity
* Activation of the complement pathway.
* Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.

The pathophysiology of type II hypersensitivity reactions can be broadly classified into three types:
* Cell depletion or destruction without inflammation
* Inflammation mediated by complement or Fc receptor
* Cellular dysfunction by antibodies

The process involves a series of immune-mediated events that might take different forms.

== Type III hypersensitivity ==


In type III hypersensitivity reaction, an abnormal immune response is mediated by the formation of antigen-antibody aggregates called &quot;immune complexes&quot;. They can precipitate in various tissues such as skin, joints, vessels, or glomeruli, and trigger the classical complement pathway. Complement activation leads to the recruitment of inflammatory cells (monocytes and neutrophils) that release lysosomal enzymes and free radicals at the site of immune complexes, causing tissue damage.

The most common diseases involving a type III hypersensitivity reaction are serum sickness, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, farmers&#x27; lung (hypersensitivity pneumonitis), and rheumatoid arthritis.

The principal feature that separates type III reactions from other hypersensitivity reactions is that in type III reaction, the antigen-antibody complexes are pre-formed in the circulation before their deposition in tissues.

== Type IV hypersensitivity ==


Type IV hypersensitivity reactions are, to some extent, normal physiological events that help fight infections, and dysfunction in this system can predispose to multiple opportunistic infections. Adverse events can also occur due to these reactions when an undesirable interaction between the immune system and an allergen happens.

=== Pathophysiology ===
A type IV hypersensitivity reaction is mediated by T cells that provoke an inflammatory reaction against exogenous or endogenous antigens. In certain situations, other cells, such as monocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophils, can be involved. After antigen exposure, an initial local immune and inflammatory response occurs that attracts leukocytes. The antigen engulfed by the macrophages and monocytes is presented to T cells, which then becomes sensitized and activated. These cells then release cytokines and chemokines, which can cause tissue damage and may result in illnesses.

Examples of illnesses resulting from type IV hypersensitivity reactions include contact dermatitis and drug hypersensitivity. Type IV reactions are further subdivided into type IVa, IVb, IVc, and IVd based on the type of T cell (Th1, Th17, and CTLs) involved and the cytokines/chemokines produced.

Delayed hypersensitivity plays a crucial role in our body&#x27;s ability to fight various intracellular pathogens such as mycobacteria and fungi. They also play a principal role in tumor immunity and transplant rejection. Since patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) have a progressive decline in the number of CD4 cells, they also have a defective type four hypersensitivity reaction.

== Treatment ==

=== Immediate hypersensitivity reactions ===
The treatment of immediate hypersensitivity reactions includes the management of anaphylaxis with intramuscular adrenaline (epinephrine), oxygen, intravenous (IV) antihistamine, support blood pressure with IV fluids, avoid latex gloves and equipment in patients who are allergic, and surgical procedures such as tracheotomy if there is severe laryngeal edema.

# Allergic bronchial asthma can be treated with any of the following: inhaled short- and long-acting bronchodilators (anticholinergics) along with inhaled corticosteroids, leukotriene antagonists, use of disodium cromoglycate, and environmental control. Experimentally, a low dose of methotrexate or cyclosporin and omalizumab (a monoclonal anti-IgE antibody) has been used.
# Treatment of autoimmune disorders (e.g., SLE) include one or a combination of NSAIDs and hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate, cyclophosphamide, low dose IL-2, intravenous immunoglobulins, and belimumab.
# Omalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that interacts with the binding site of the high-affinity IgE receptor on mast cells. It is an engineered, humanized recombinant immunoglobulin. Moderate to severe allergic bronchial asthma can improve with omalizumab.

=== Delayed hypersensitivity reactions ===
Treatment of type 4 HR involves the treatment of the eliciting cause.

# The most common drugs to treat tuberculosis include isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. For drug-resistant TB, a combination of antibiotics such as amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin should be used.
# The most common drugs to treat leprosy include rifampicin and clofazimine in combination with dapsone for multibacillary leprosy. A single dose of antimicrobial combination to cure single lesion paucibacillary leprosy comprises ofloxacin, rifampicin, and minocycline.
# Praziquantel can be useful for treating infections caused by all &quot;Schistosoma&quot; species.
# Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine can use in the therapy of sarcoidosis involving the skin, lungs, and the nervous system.
# The use of anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies such as adalimumab and certolizumab have been approved for Crohn disease.

<text>The Visit (, English: &quot;The Visit of the Old Lady&quot;) is a 1956 tragicomic play by Swiss dramatist Friedrich Dürrenmatt.

==Synopsis==
An enormously wealthy older woman returns to her former hometown with a dreadful bargain: she wants the townspeople to kill the man who got her pregnant, then jilted her. In exchange, she will provide enough money to revitalize the decrepit town. The townspeople eventually agree.

==Plot==

===Act I===
The story opens with the town of Güllen (a name evoking &quot;liquid manure&quot; in German) preparing for the arrival of famed billionaire Claire Zachanassian, who grew up there. Güllen has fallen on hard times, and the townspeople hope that Claire will provide them with much-needed funds. Alfred Ill (Anton Schill in a common English-language adaptation) is the owner of Güllen&#x27;s general store and the most popular man in town. He was Claire&#x27;s lover when they were young, and agrees with the mayor that the task of convincing her to make a donation should fall to him.

After settling into the hotel, Claire joins the rest of the town, who have gathered outside for a homecoming celebration. Claire takes the opportunity to announce that she will make a huge donation: one billion (presumably Swiss francs), half for the town and half to be shared among the families. The townspeople are overjoyed, but their happiness is damped when Claire&#x27;s butler steps forward to reveal her condition for the donation. The butler was once the Lord Chief Justice of Güllen, and had heard the paternity suit that Claire had brought against Alfred. In the suit, Alfred produced two false witnesses (who have since been transformed into Claire&#x27;s eunuchs), and the court ruled in his favor. Socially disgraced, Claire was exiled, lost the child and eventually met a wealthy client while working as a prostitute in the city. Her donation is conditional on someone killing Alfred. The mayor refuses and the town seems aghast, but Claire says that she will wait.

===Act II===
As time passes, Alfred becomes increasingly paranoid as he sees everyone purchasing especially costly items on credit in his shop. Alfred visits the police officer and the mayor, who have also bought new expensive items, and they dismiss his concerns. He then visits the priest, who attempts to calm him, but finally admits they have been paid off, and advises Alfred to flee.

Alfred heads to the railway station to escape, but finds that the entire town is gathered there. They ask him where he is going, and he says that he is planning to move to Australia. They wish him well, again assuring him that he has nothing to fear in Güllen, but Alfred grows increasingly nervous nonetheless. The train arrives, but he decides not to board, believing that someone will stop him anyway. Paralyzed, he collapses in the crowd, crying, &quot;I&#x27;m lost!&quot;

===Act III===
Claire weds a new husband in the Güllen cathedral. The doctor and the schoolmaster go to see her and explain that the townspeople have run up considerable debt since her arrival. The schoolmaster begs her to abandon her desire for vengeance and help the town out of the goodness of her heart, and also because it would be good business: they need her money merely as (profitable) investment, as the city despite its current ruined state has great economic potential. However, Claire informs him that she knows that quite well, and she herself had caused Güllen to fall on hard times to ensure that the people would do &quot;anything&quot; for money.

Alfred&#x27;s terror grows as the townspeople buy more expensive products on credit. Hearing of Claire&#x27;s wedding, reporters are everywhere, and they enter the store to interview Alfred. The schoolmaster, drunk, tries to inform the press about Claire&#x27;s proposal, but the townspeople stop him. The schoolmaster and Alfred have a discussion and the schoolmaster explains Alfred will be killed. Alfred accepts his guilt and acknowledges the town&#x27;s suffering is his fault. Alfred is then confronted by the mayor who asks if he will accept the town&#x27;s judgment. Alfred says that he will.

Claire tells Alfred that she never stopped loving him, but that over time her love has grown into something monstrous.

When Alfred arrives at the town meeting, it is flooded with the press, and the town publicly announces their acceptance of Claire&#x27;s donation. The inhabitants then go through the formality of a vote, which is unanimous, and the mayor states that they have Alfred to thank for their newfound wealth. The doors are locked and the lights dimmed. Alfred is killed by a crowd of townspeople. Just as a reporter reappears in the auditorium, the doctor announces that Alfred has died of a heart attack. The reporters gather and declare that Alfred has died of joy. Claire examines the body, gives the mayor his check, and leaves the town with Alfred&#x27;s body in the casket that she brought with her when she arrived.

==Adaptations==

The play premiered in 1956 as &quot;Besuch der alten Dame&quot; at the Schauspielhaus Zürich, with a cast that included Ruedi Walter as the blind eunuch &quot;Loby&quot;.

The original 1956 play was adapted for British audiences by Maurice Valency as &quot;The Visit&quot;. This adaptation changes several characters&#x27; names (most notably, Alfred Ill becomes Anton Schill) and removes several elements from the story. It was directed by Peter Brook and starred Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne. After being seen on tour in Britain in 1957–58, the production was taken to Broadway.

The play was adapted as an opera libretto by the author and set to music by the composer Gottfried von Einem, under the title &quot;Der Besuch der alten Dame&quot; and translated as &quot;The Visit of the Old Lady&quot;, and was first performed in 1971.

Ingrid Bergman and Anthony Quinn starred in a much-altered film adaptation, also called &quot;The Visit&quot;, directed by Bernhard Wicki, in 1964. A significant alteration in this 1964 film is in the ending: Just as Alfred Ill (Serge Miller in the movie) is about to be executed on the trumped-up charges the town has created, the billionairess stops the execution. She declares that she will give the money to the town as pledged. Her revenge on Miller is that now, as she declares, he must live in the town among the people who would have executed him on false charges for money.

In 1976 &quot;The Visit&quot; was adapted for Lebanese National Television Tele Liban (the only broadcasting station in Lebanon at that time) as the full sixth episode of the hit TV series &quot;Allo Hayeti ألو حياتي&quot; directed for TV by Antoine Remi أنطوان ريمي, and Starring Hind Abi Al Lamaa هند أبي اللمع as Claire (or Clara as called in the Lebanese production) and Abdel Majeed Majzoob عبد المجيد مجذوب as her lover Alfred, Layla Karam, Philip Akiki (as the Mayor) and Elias Rizk (as the teacher). This production made Friedrich Dürrenmatt known to the Lebanese public as well as to Arabic viewers.

USSR movie was shot in 1989, directed by Mikhail Kozakov, starring Yekaterina Vasilyeva and Valentin Gaft. It consist of 2 parts.

A Senegalese film adaptation written and directed by Djibril Diop Mambéty, &quot;Hyenas&quot;, reimagined the story as an allegory of neocolonialism and African consumerism. The film was entered into the 1992 Cannes Film Festival.

&quot;The Visit&quot; was performed at Chichester Arts Festival of 1995. Players included Lauren Bacall and Joss Ackland.

&quot;&quot; is a 1996 Argentinian film directed by Jorge Polaco starring Isabel Sarli. It won the Special Jury Prize at the 1996 &quot;Amiens International Film Festival&quot;.

A musical adaptation, &quot;The Visit&quot;, with music by John Kander, lyrics by Fred Ebb, and book by Terrence McNally, received its first production at Chicago&#x27;s Goodman Theatre, starring Chita Rivera and John McMartin, in 2001. That production was choreographed by Ann Reinking and directed by Frank Galati. The musical was revised and played from May 13 – June 22, 2008, at Signature Theatre in Arlington, Virginia, in a production once again starring Rivera, this time with George Hearn. In 2015 Rivera and Roger Rees took this adaptation of &quot;The Visit&quot; to Broadway, with preview performances on March 26, 2015, at the Lyceum Theatre under the Tony Award-winning direction of John Doyle. It opened on April 23, 2015, and closed on June 14, 2015.

A new English language adaptation written by Tony Kushner and directed by Jeremy Herrin played at the National Theatre in London from February 11 to May 13, 2020. Starring Lesley Manville as Claire and Hugo Weaving as Alfred, this production retained Dürrenmatt&#x27;s original three-act structure (as does Valency&#x27;s adaptation) but moved the location of the play from the fictional town of Güllen to the fictional town of Slurry, New York.

In Iran, the script has been translated to Persian by Hamid Samandarian, who also staged the play later on. It was later brought to the stage as a musical by Hadi Hejazifar. In 2021, Mohsen Gharaie made Without Everything&quot;,&quot; an Iranian drama film based on the play. It received five awards and nine nominations at the 39th Fajr Film Festival. The film had its theatrical release in Iran on December 15, 2021.

<text>Joseph Maxwell Cleland (August 24, 1942 – November 9, 2021) was an American politician from Georgia. A member of the Democratic Party, he was a disabled U.S. Army veteran of the Vietnam War, a recipient of the Silver Star and the Bronze Star for valorous actions in combat, as well as a United States Senator (1997–2003).

After returning from the Vietnam War having lost three limbs, he entered politics soon after recovering from his injuries. From 1971 to 1975, he served as a Georgia State Senator. He also served as Administrator of Veterans Affairs under President Jimmy Carter from 1977 to 1981 and as Georgia Secretary of State from 1982 to 1996 before being elected to a single term in the United States Senate. After leaving the Senate in 2003, he served on the board of directors of the Export-Import Bank of the United States from 2003 to 2007, a presidentially appointed position. From 2009 to 2017, he served as Secretary of the American Battle Monuments Commission.

== Early life and military service ==
Cleland was born on August 24, 1942, in Atlanta, the son of Juanita Wilda (Kesler) and Joseph Hughie Cleland. He grew up in Lithonia, Georgia, and graduated from Stetson University in the class of 1964, where he was a member of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. Cleland was named outstanding senior in high school. He went on to receive a master&#x27;s degree from Emory University (Georgia).

Cleland then served in the United States Army during the Vietnam War, attaining the rank of captain. He was awarded the Silver Star and the Bronze Star for valorous action in combat, including during the Battle of Khe Sanh on April 4, 1968.

===Injury at Khe Sanh===
In 1968, Captain Cleland was the Battalion Signal Officer serving with the 2nd Battalion, 12th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division during the Battle of Khe Sanh.
On April 8, with a month left in his tour, Cleland was ordered to set up a radio relay station on a nearby hill. A helicopter flew him and two soldiers to the treeless top of Hill 471, east of Khe Sanh. When the helicopter landed, Cleland jumped out, followed by the two soldiers. They ducked because of the rotor wash and turned to watch the liftoff. Cleland reached down to pick up a grenade he believed had dropped off his flak jacket. It then exploded, the blast slamming him backward, shredding both his legs and one arm.

David Lloyd, a U.S. Marine in a nearby mortar bunker, rushed to the scene, took off his web belt and tied it around one of Cleland&#x27;s legs to control bleeding.

Lloyd said the unnamed soldier was crying. &quot;It was mine,&quot; he said, &quot;it was my grenade.&quot; According to Lloyd, the private had failed to take the extra precaution experienced soldiers did when they grabbed M26 grenades from the ammo box: bend the pins, or tape them in place, so they couldn&#x27;t accidentally dislodge. This soldier had a flak jacket full of grenades with straight pins. &quot;He was a walking death trap.&quot;

Due to the severity of his wounds, doctors amputated both of Cleland&#x27;s legs above the knee, and his right forearm. He was 25 years old.

== Georgia state politics ==

Cleland served from 1971 to 1975 in the Georgia Senate, and became an advocate for affairs relating to veterans. He was the administrator of the United States Veterans Administration under President Jimmy Carter from 1977 to 1981 (Carter himself was Governor of Georgia at the time Cleland was a member of the State Senate). He then served 14 years as Secretary of State of Georgia from 1982 to 1996, working closely with his future Senate colleague, Zell Miller. During this period, Cleland promoted a penny stock law in Georgia which would become the template for national regulations to curb stock manipulation abuses. In the 1992 Democratic presidential primaries, Cleland supported fellow Vietnam veteran Bob Kerrey.

According to an interview featurette with Jon Voight on the DVD of &quot;Coming Home&quot; (1978), Cleland also served during this time as a consultant on the Academy Award-winning drama set in a VA hospital in 1968.

In 1977, Cleland received the Samuel S. Beard Award for Greatest Public Service by an Individual 35 Years or Under, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.

== U.S. Senate (1997–2003) ==

=== Tenure ===
Following the retirement of Sam Nunn, Cleland ran in the 1996 United States Senate election in Georgia and won by 30,024 votes over Republican Guy Millner.

Cleland was viewed as a moderate in the Senate. Though he supported some Republican budgetary measures, and voted in favor of George W. Bush&#x27;s 2001 tax-cut package, he was staunchly pro-choice and pro-environment. He voted against drilling in ANWR, and opposed Gale Norton&#x27;s nomination as Secretary of the Interior in 2001. His record on national defense and homeland security was more centrist. He voted to federalize airport security after 9/11, and supported the war on terror. Cleland was strongly for free trade, voting to normalize trade relations with Vietnam, to make China&#x27;s NTR status permanent, and to extend free trade to Andean nations.

Cleland was one of the 29 Senate Democrats who backed the authorization to go to war in Iraq. He later stated he had misgivings about the Bush administration&#x27;s stance, but said he felt pressure in his tight Senate race to go along with it. In 2005, he said &quot;it was obvious that if I voted against the resolution that I would be dead meat in the race, just handing them in a victory.&quot; He characterized his vote for war as &quot;the worst vote I cast.&quot;

== 2002 election ==
In 2002 Cleland faced Saxby Chambliss for the Georgia Senate seat. Cleland enjoyed a comfortable lead in the polls early in the race but lost much ground in the weeks running up to the election. In May 2002 Chambliss was trailing Cleland by 22 percentage points. Chambliss issued a press release decrying Senator Cleland for &quot;breaking his oath to protect and defend the Constitution,&quot; because Cleland had voted for an amendment to the Chemical Weapons Treaty that would allow individuals from &quot;terrorist nations&quot; to be on United Nations weapons inspection teams in Iraq. The vote passed by a majority, 56 to 44. Fifty-five other senators also voted for the amendment, including Bill Frist, the head of the Republican Senate committee, who picked Chambliss to run against Cleland.

A week before the voting, an &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; poll showed Cleland ahead by five points, 49% to 44%. By Saturday before the race, a poll by the &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; the lead had shrunk to 48% to 45% which was within the poll&#x27;s margin of error. On election day, Cleland lost to Chambliss by 139,296 votes. Some supporters blamed a Chambliss television ad created by consultant Rick Wilson featuring the likenesses of Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein while criticizing Cleland&#x27;s votes against homeland security measures. This was based on the fact that Cleland had voted against legislation enabling the creation of the Department of Homeland Security on the basis that a provision limiting the rights of unionized labor had been inserted into the bill. Cleland supporters claimed the ad questioned the senator&#x27;s patriotism, while Chambliss supporters claimed it simply questioned his judgment. The ad was removed after protests from prominent politicians, including Republicans such as John McCain and Chuck Hagel, both of whom were also veterans of the war in Vietnam.

== Post-Senate career ==

Cleland was originally appointed to serve on the 9/11 Commission but resigned shortly after, having been appointed to the board of directors of the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Before his resignation, he said that the Bush administration was &quot;stonewalling&quot; and blocking the committee&#x27;s access to key documents and witnesses. A key figure in the widespread criticism of governmental opacity regarding 9/11, he was quoted as saying in November 2003: &quot;I... cannot look any American in the eye, especially family members of victims, and say the commission had full access. This investigation is now compromised.&quot;

In 2003, Cleland began working for the 2004 presidential campaign of Massachusetts senator John Kerry, also a Vietnam veteran; Kerry went on to win the Democratic nomination. Cleland often appeared at campaign events with Kerry and was considered by many to be one of his most important surrogates, partly as a symbol of the sacrifices made by soldiers for wars. On July 29, 2004, Cleland introduced Kerry with a speech at the Democratic National Convention.

Cleland&#x27;s official Senatorial papers are held by the University of Georgia&#x27;s Richard B. Russell Library for Political Research and Studies. His Veterans Administration papers are held in the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library. In 2007, Max Cleland donated a large collection of Vietnam and personal political memorabilia to the library of his alma mater, Stetson University. The Cleland Collection includes more than 800 memorabilia items, more than 5,000 photos, and hundreds of CDs, DVDs, videos, and films.

On May 21, 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Cleland to serve as the next Secretary of the American Battle Monuments Commission. He was appointed Secretary on June 3, and served in the position until the end of Obama&#x27;s second term as president. Retired Major General William M. Matz Jr., was appointed as his successor almost a year after he left the ABMC.

Cleland died as a result of heart failure at his home in Atlanta, on November 9, 2021, at age 79.

Cleland received an honorary degree in 2001 from Oglethorpe University as a Doctor of Laws.

<text>Al-Damun (, &quot;al-Dâmûn&quot;), was a Palestinian Arab village located from the city of Acre that was depopulated during 1948 Arab-Israeli war. In 1945, the village had 1,310 inhabitants, most of whom were Muslim and the remainder Christians. Al-Damun bordered the al-Na&#x27;amin River (Belus River), which the village&#x27;s inhabitants used as a source of irrigation and drinking water from installed wells.

==History==
Excavations at the site has shown pot sherds dating from the Late Bronze Age, up to and including Early Islamic, Crusader, Mamluk and Ottoman times. It might be the village Damun in lower Galilee, noted in Roman times.

Al-Damun is mentioned in early Arab and Persian sources from the 11th century CE. Local tradition identified the village as containing the tomb of the prophet Dhul-Kifl, who is mentioned in the Qur&#x27;an twice. Despite Islamic tradition claiming the tomb to be in al-Kifl near Najaf or Kifl Hares near Nablus, Nasir Khusrawl, who visited the region in 1047, wrote &quot;I reached a small cave, which is in Damun where I performed the &quot;ziyarat&quot; too, for it is said to be the tomb of Dhul-Kifl.&quot;

Al-Damun was captured by the Crusaders, who referred to it as &quot;Damar&quot; or &quot;Damor&quot;, during their invasion of the Levant in 1099; and it remained in their hands unlike most of Palestine, which was conquered by the Ayyubidss under Sultan Saladin in 1187. In 1253 John Aleman, Lord of Caesarea, sold several villages, including al-Damun, to the Knights Hospitaller. It was mentioned as part of the Crusaders&#x27; domain in the &quot;hudna&quot; (truce agreement) between the Acre-based Crusaders and the Mamluks under Sultan al-Mansur Qalawun in 1283.

===Ottoman Empire===
Al-Damun, like the rest of Palestine, was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517, and in the census of 1596 the village was located in the Akka Nahiya (Subdistrict of Acre), part of the Safad Sanjak (District of Safed). The population consisted of 33 households and two bachelors, all Muslim. The inhabitants paid a fixed tax rate of 20% on wheat, barley, fruit trees, cotton, goats and beehives, in addition to &quot;occasional revenues&quot;; total revenue was 6,045 akçe.

Until the late 18th century the village was ruled by the local Zaydani clan, which rose to prominence in the Galilee through the campaigns of Sheikh Zahir al-Umar. The village mosque was built by its multazim (tax farmer), Zahir&#x27;s uncle Ali ibn Salih, in 1722–23. Inscriptions on the mosque gave the genealogy of the Zaydani family and included a poem dedicated to Ali. In the late 18th century, Giovanni Mariti noted that around al-Damun and Mi&#x27;ar were two &quot;delightful valleys, ornamented with groves and wild shrubs. The peasants who live in the hamlets around, enjoy a most pleasant situation.&quot; A map by Pierre Jacotin from Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of 1799 showed the place, named as &quot;Damoun&quot;.

In 1875, al-Damun was prosperous and had roughly 800, mostly Muslim inhabitants and two mosques. In addition to the possible tomb of Dhul-Kifl, there was a shrine dedicated to a certain Sheikh Abdallah on an adjacent hill. An elementary school for boys was founded by the Ottomans in 1886. A population list from about 1887 showed that Khirbet al-Damun had about 725 inhabitants, all Muslims.

=== British Mandate ===
At the time of the 1922 census of Palestine, al-Damun had a population of 727, of whom 687 were Muslims and 40 were Christians. All the Christians were Roman Catholic. The population increased in the 1931 census to 917: 870 Muslims and 47 Christians, living in 183 houses.

At the beginning of the 20th century al-Damun&#x27;s houses were clustered along one road, and starting in 1935 the residents started to build them with reinforced concrete. The inhabitants drew their drinking water from nearby springs and irrigated some of their crops from the Na&#x27;amin River. They also engaged in allied activities, particularly plaiting mats and baskets from esparto grass. The chief crops of al-Damun were wheat, sorghum, barley, and olives, but it was also well known for its watermelons and cantaloupes.

In the 1945 statistics the population of al-Damun was 1,310; 1,240 Muslims and 70 Christians, The village&#x27;s total land area was 20,357 dunams of land according to an official land and population survey. 709 dunams were plantations and irrigable land, 17,052 used for cereals, while 111 dunams were built-up (urban) land.

Before the 1948 Arab-Israeli War the Haganah kept files on all the Palestinian villages. The 1947 entry for al-Damun listed 25 individuals suspected of involvement with the Palestinian nationalist movement. In April 1948 Haganah reports say that the son of the main local land-owner, Sadiq Karaman, paid the local ALA garrison P£5000 to leave, presumably in an attempt to keep the village from getting involved with the hostilities in the 1948 Palestine war.

=== Israel ===
After the initial Israeli successes in the central Galilee during the first stage of Operation Dekel, units of the Haganah&#x27;s Sheva Brigade moved westward and captured al-Damun, among other Arab localities, in the second stage of the operation on July 15–16, 1948. However, Palestinian historian, Aref al-Aref, dates its capture earlier in May 1948, following the fall of Acre. Israeli historian Benny Morris said that inhabitants were demoralized by the fall of Acre and then Nazareth, and so fled during the bombardment that preceded the attack on the village. The remaining residents were expelled and al-Damun itself was completely destroyed according to both historians.

Following the war the area was incorporated into the State of Israel. The village&#x27;s land is used for agriculture by residents of the Yas&#x27;ur kibbutz, which itself was built on the land of al-Birwa. Al-Damun is among the Palestinian villages for which commemorative Marches of Return have taken place, typically as part of Nakba Day, such as the demonstrations organized by the Association for the Defence of the Rights of the Internally Displaced.

According to Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi in 1992, the site was &quot;overgrown with thorns, cacti, olive trees, and pines. Stone and concrete rubble is scattered around it. The structure that formerly protected the central water source and regulated its flow stands untended and is collapsing in several places. The cemetery is extant, although the markers over a few graves are collapsing.&quot; British historian Andrew Petersen writes that the village had a number of eighteenth or nineteenth-century stone houses, some which had decorated facades.

<text>Zell Bryan Miller (February 24, 1932 – March 23, 2018) was an American politician who served as a United States senator representing Georgia from 2000 to 2005 and as the 79th governor of Georgia from 1991 to 1999. He was a member of the Democratic Party, and until 2021, was the last Democratic senator from Georgia.

Miller served as lieutenant governor of Georgia from 1975 to 1991. After being more liberal as governor in the 1990s, he was a conservative Democrat as a senator in the 2000s. In 2004, he backed Republican president George W. Bush over Democratic nominee John Kerry in the presidential election. Miller was a keynote speaker at both major American political parties&#x27; national conventions–Democratic in 1992 and Republican in 2004.

He did not seek re-election to the Senate in 2004. After retiring from the Senate, he joined the law firm McKenna Long &amp; Aldridge as a non-lawyer professional in the firm&#x27;s national government affairs practice. Miller was also a Fox News contributor. After he left his office in 2005, no Georgia Democrats were elected to the United States Senate for 16 years until Raphael Warnock won Miller&#x27;s former seat in the 2020–2021 special runoff election and Jon Ossoff won the Class 2 seat in the 2020–2021 regular runoff election.

==Early life and military career==
Miller was born in the small mountain town of Young Harris, Georgia. His father, Stephen Grady Miller (1891–1932), was a teacher who died of cerebral meningitis when Miller was a 17-day-old infant, and the future politician was raised by his widowed mother, Birdie Bryan (1893–1980). He had a sister, Jane, who was six years older than he. As a child, Miller lived both in Young Harris and Atlanta. Miller received an associate degree from Young Harris College in his home town and later attended Emory University.

Less than a month after the Korean War armistice, Miller wound up in a drunk tank in the mountains of North Georgia. Miller stated later that this incident was the lowest point of his life. Upon his release, Miller enlisted in the Marines. During his three years in the United States Marine Corps, Miller attained the rank of sergeant. He often referred to the value of his experience in the Marine Corps in his writing and stump speeches. 
In his book on the subject, entitled &quot;Corps Values: Everything You Need to Know I Learned in the Marines&quot;, he wrote:

After serving in the Marines, Miller enrolled in 1956 and earned bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in history from the University of Georgia. He taught history at Young Harris College following his graduation from the University of Georgia.

==Political career==

Miller&#x27;s parents were both involved in local politics in the North Georgia mountains. Miller, a Democrat, taught history and political science at Young Harris College, before becoming mayor of Young Harris from 1959 to 1960. He was elected to two terms as a Georgia state senator from 1961 until 1964. In 1964 and 1966, Miller unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for the United States House of Representatives. He endorsed segregation in both races. In these congressional races, Miller denounced Lyndon Johnson as &quot;&quot;a Southerner who has sold his birthright for a mess of dark porridge.&quot;. Miller later served in state government as the executive secretary to Governor Lester Maddox and in the Georgia Democratic Party, and was the Georgia state chairman for Walter Mondale&#x27;s 1984 presidential campaign.

Miller&#x27;s first experience in the executive branch of government was as Chief of Staff for Georgia governor Lester Maddox. Although Maddox had run on a segregationist platform, Miller convinced Maddox to do many shocking things in office, such as integrating the Georgia State Patrol, appointing African Americans to government positions, and reforming prisons. Miller was elected Lieutenant Governor of Georgia in 1974, serving four terms from 1975 to 1991, through the terms of Governors George Busbee and Joe Frank Harris, making him the longest-serving lieutenant governor in Georgia history. In 1980, Miller unsuccessfully challenged Herman Talmadge in the Democratic primary for his seat in the United States Senate. Some analysts surmised that Miller so severely weakened Talmadge in the primary, considered one of Georgia&#x27;s nastiest, that it caused Talmadge to narrowly lose in the fall to Georgia&#x27;s first Republican elected to the Senate since Reconstruction, Mack Mattingly.

===Governor===
Miller was elected governor of Georgia in 1990, defeating Republican Johnny Isakson (who later became his successor as U.S. Senator) after defeating former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young and future Governor Roy Barnes in the primary. Miller campaigned on the concept of term limits and pledged to seek only a single term as governor. He later ran for and won re-election in 1994. James Carville was Miller&#x27;s campaign manager.

In 1991, Miller endorsed Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas for president. Miller gave the keynote speech at the 1992 Democratic National Convention at Madison Square Garden in New York City. In two oft-recalled lines, Miller said that President George H. W. Bush &quot;just doesn&#x27;t get it,&quot; and he remarked of a statement by Vice President Dan Quayle:

Twelve years later, Miller would give the keynote address at the opposing party&#x27;s convention, also held at New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden, in 2004.

As governor, Miller was perhaps best known for his advocacy of a law passed in Georgia known as &quot;two strikes and you&#x27;re out&quot;, as any person convicted for the second time of any included offense would automatically be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The law derives its name from and stands in contrast to the three strikes law, and is also known as the Seven-deadly-sins law. The law was passed in April 1994, although it had been advocated by Miller for many years previously. It was approved by voters on November 8, 1994, and was signed into law by then Governor Zell Miller on December 15, 1994, and went into effect on January 1, 1995. The law is codified and found under Title 17, Chapter 10, Section 7 (OCGA Section 17-10-7) of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated. The law states that those convicted of second-degree murder, armed robbery, or kidnapping (of a person 14 years of age or older) must serve a minimum term of 10 years in prison, and those convicted of rape, kidnapping of a minor under 14 years old, aggravated sexual battery, aggravated sodomy or aggravated child molestation must serve a minimum term of not less than 25 years in prison. First-degree murder is punishable by death, life without parole, or life in prison with no parole until the offender serves at least 30 years in prison. These crimes are known in Georgia as the &quot;seven deadly sins&quot;.

As governor, Miller was a staunch promoter of public education. He helped found the HOPE Scholarship, which paid for the college tuition of Georgia students who both established a GPA of 3.0 in high school and maintained the same while in college, and who were from families earning less than $66,000 per year. The HOPE Scholarships were funded by revenue collected from the state lottery. In December 1995, his office announced a proposal for $1 billion more in spending on education. HOPE won praise from national Democratic leaders. The HOPE Scholarship program still to this day provides Georgia students with an opportunity to attend a public college or university, who otherwise may have no opportunity to do so.

Upon leaving the governor&#x27;s office in January 1999, Miller accepted teaching positions at Young Harris College, Emory University, and the University of Georgia. He was a visiting professor at all three institutions when he was appointed to the U.S. Senate in 2000.

===Senate===

Miller&#x27;s successor as governor, Roy Barnes, appointed Miller to a U.S. Senate seat following the death of Republican senator Paul Coverdell in July 2000. Although the Democratic Party&#x27;s historic control of Georgia politics had been waning for years, Miller remained popular. He defeated former U.S. Senator Mack Mattingly in a special election to keep the seat in November 2000.

Miller often supported Republicans and criticized Democrats during his tenure in the Senate. He supported much of George W. Bush&#x27;s agenda, including tax cuts (which Miller co-sponsored) and oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. He supported anti-abortion policies as a senator, after supporting abortion rights as governor. He also supported a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage as senator, after inviting the Gay Games to Atlanta as governor. However, Miller remained a Democrat, saying, &quot;I&#x27;ll be a Democrat &#x27;til the day I die.&quot; Miller campaigned for fellow Georgia Democrat Max Cleland in his 2002 re-election campaign against Republican Congressman Saxby Chambliss, despite their ideological differences.

Miller argued in his book &quot;A National Party No More: The Conscience of a Conservative Democrat&quot; (authored and published in 2003) that the Democratic Party lost its majority because it did not stand for the same ideals that it did in the era of John F. Kennedy. He argued that the Democratic Party, as it now stood, was a far left-wing party that was out of touch with the America of today and that the Republican Party now embraced the conservative Democratic ideals that he had held for so long. The book spent nine weeks in the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for hardcover non-fiction, peaking at number four.

In 2003, Miller announced that he would not seek re-election after completing his term in the Senate. He also announced that he would support President George W. Bush in the 2004 presidential election rather than any of the nine candidates then competing for his own party&#x27;s nomination. Shortly after announcing his retirement, Miller began to call for the repeal of the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which allowed for the direct election of U.S. Senators, rather than having U.S. Senators be elected by state legislatures. During his four years in the Senate, Zell Miller received a cumulative rating of 70% from the American Conservative Union, including a rating of 96% in 2004. Democratic Congresswoman Denise Majette sought to fill Miller&#x27;s Senate seat, but lost the 2004 election to Republican Johnny Isakson.

===2004 election support for Republicans===
In his keynote speech at the 2004 Republican National Convention, delivered on September 1, 2004, Miller criticized the state of the Democratic Party. He said, &quot;No pair has been more wrong, more loudly, more often than the two senators from Massachusetts – Ted Kennedy and John Kerry.&quot; He also criticized John Kerry&#x27;s Senate voting record, claiming that Kerry&#x27;s votes against bills for defense and weapon systems indicated support for weakening U.S. military strength.

The speech was well received by the convention attendees, especially the Georgia delegates. Conservative commentator Michael Barone compared the speech to the views and ideology of Andrew Jackson.

Miller&#x27;s combative reaction to post-speech media interviews received almost as much attention as the speech itself. First, in an interview with CNN, Miller had a dispute with Judy Woodruff, Wolf Blitzer, and Jeff Greenfield when they questioned him on his speech, particularly on whether he had misinterpreted the context and full content of Kerry&#x27;s votes, and the fact that Dick Cheney, as Defense Secretary, had opposed some of the same programs he attacked Kerry for voting against.

Shortly thereafter, Miller appeared in an interview with Chris Matthews on the MSNBC show &quot;Hardball&quot;. After Miller expressed irritation at Matthews&#x27; line of questioning, Matthews pressed Miller with the question, &quot;Do you believe now – do you believe, Senator, truthfully, that John Kerry wants to defend the country with spitballs?&quot; Miller angrily told Matthews, &quot;&quot;That&quot; was a metaphor, wasn&#x27;t it? Do &quot;you&quot; know what a metaphor is? This is your program, and I&#x27;m a guest on your program, so I want to try to be as nice as I possibly can to you. I wish I was over there where I could get a little closer up into your face...I knew you was gonna be coming with all of that stuff...I think we ought to cancel this interview...get out of my face,&quot; and declared, &quot;I wish we lived in the day where you could challenge a person to a duel.&quot; Miller later said about the interview, &quot;That was terrible. I embarrassed myself. I&#x27;d rather it had not happened.&quot;

After Bush won the election of 2004, Miller referred to the Republican victories in that election (including a sweep of five open Senate seats in the South) as a sign that Democrats did not relate to most Americans. Calling for Democrats to change their message, he authored a column, which appeared in &quot;The Washington Times&quot; on November 4, 2004, in which he wrote:

===Post-2004 endorsements===
In 2008, after Barack Obama was elected president and Democrats increased their majorities in the House and Senate, Miller endorsed Republican Saxby Chambliss in the Senate run-off against Democrat Jim Martin and criticized Obama over &quot;spreading the wealth.&quot;

In 2012, Miller served as the national co-chair to the campaign of Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich. The same year, Miller endorsed Doug Collins, the Republican candidate in the 9th District of Georgia congressional race.

In 2014, Miller endorsed major Georgia candidates in both parties. He made a TV ad supporting the candidacy of Michelle Nunn, who was the Democratic nominee for the U.S. Senate. He appeared in the ad with her, saying he was &quot;angry about what&#x27;s going on in Washington, partisanship over patriotism&quot; and praised Nunn as a &quot;bridge-builder, not a bridge-burner.&quot; However, he also endorsed incumbent Republican governor Nathan Deal for reelection.

==Life after politics==
In August 2005, President Bush appointed Miller to the American Battle Monuments Commission.

In 2005, Miller was elected to the board of directors of the National Rifle Association of America.

Miller was a speaker at &quot;Justice Sunday II,&quot; an event organized by conservative Christian evangelicals to combat alleged liberal bias in the federal judiciary of the United States. The event was held in Nashville, Tennessee on August 14, 2005, and featured Tony Perkins and James Dobson. Miller criticized the United States Supreme Court, saying that it had &quot;removed prayer from our public schools ... legalized the barbaric killing of unborn babies and it is ready to discard like an outdated hula hoop the universal institution of marriage between a man and a woman.&quot;

The Student Learning Center (SLC) at the University of Georgia was renamed to the Zell B. Miller Learning Center (Miller Learning Center or MLC for short) in October 2008.

Miller&#x27;s health took a downward turn in the late 2000s when he developed Parkinson&#x27;s disease and other health concerns, which ended in various complications. In 2016, Miller&#x27;s grandson, Bryan Miller, started the Miller Institute Foundation as a way to preserve and promote his grandfather&#x27;s legacy. By October 2017, Miller had officially retired from public life and was undergoing treatment for Parkinson&#x27;s.

==Death==
Miller died on March 23, 2018, at his home in Young Harris, Georgia, from complications of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. His state funeral was held in Atlanta on March 28 with incumbent governor Nathan Deal, U.S. secretary of agriculture Sonny Perdue, U.S. senator Johnny Isakson, former senator Max Cleland, former lieutenant governor Pierre Howard and three former U.S. presidents—Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush—in attendance.

<doc id="335067" wikidata="Q343633" url="?curid=335067" title="Burgess Meredith">
<text>Oliver Burgess Meredith (November 16, 1907 – September 9, 1997) was an American actor and filmmaker whose career encompassed radio, theater, film, and television.

Active for more than six decades, Meredith has been called &quot;a virtuosic actor&quot; and &quot;one of the most accomplished actors of the century&quot;. A lifetime member of the Actors Studio, he won a Primetime Emmy Award, was the first male actor to win the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor twice, and was nominated for two Academy Awards.

Meredith established himself as a leading man in Hollywood with critically acclaimed performances as Mio Romagna in &quot;Winterset&quot; (1936), George Milton in &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; (1939), and Ernie Pyle in &quot;The Story of G.I. Joe&quot; (1945).

Meredith was known later in his career for his appearances on &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; and for portraying The Penguin in the 1960s TV series &quot;Batman&quot; and boxing trainer Mickey Goldmill in the &quot;Rocky&quot; film series. For his performances in &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot; (1975) and &quot;Rocky&quot; (1976), he received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He later appeared in the comedy &quot;Foul Play&quot; (1978) and the fantasy film &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot; (1981). He narrated numerous films and documentaries during his long career.

&quot;Although those performances renewed his popularity,&quot; observed Mel Gussow in &quot;The New York Times&quot; (referring to the Penguin and Mickey Goldmill roles), &quot;they represented only a small part of a richly varied career in which he played many of the more demanding roles in classical and contemporary theater—in plays by Shakespeare, O&#x27;Neill, Beckett and others.&quot;

==Early life==
Meredith was born in 1907 in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of Ida Beth (née Burgess; 1861–1933) and William George Meredith (1861–1938), a Canadian-born physician of English descent. His mother came from a long line of Methodist revivalists, a religion to which he adhered throughout his lifetime.
He graduated from Hoosac School in 1926 and then attended Amherst College (class of 1931). He left Amherst and became a reporter for the &quot;Stamford Advocate&quot;.

==Career==
===Theatre===

In 1929, he became a member of Eva Le Gallienne&#x27;s Civic Repertory Theatre company in New York City. Although best known to the larger world audience for his film and television work, Meredith was an influential actor and director for the stage. He made his Broadway debut as Peter in Le Gallienne&#x27;s production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1930) and became a star in Maxwell Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Winterset&quot; (1935), which became his film debut the following year. His early life and theatre work were the subject of a &quot;New Yorker&quot; profile. In 1935, he starred along with Hugh Williams at the Martin Beck Theatre in John Van Druten&#x27;s &quot;Flowers of the Forest&quot;.

He garnered critical acclaim in the 1935 Broadway revival of &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot; starring Katharine Cornell. She subsequently cast him in several of her later productions. Other Broadway roles included Van van Dorn in &quot;High Tor&quot; (1937), Liliom in &quot;Liliom&quot; (1940), Christy Mahon in &quot;The Playboy of the Western World&quot; (1946), and Adolphus Cusins in &quot;Major Barbara&quot; (1956). He created the role of Erie Smith in the English-language premiere of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;Hughie&quot; at the Theater Royal in Bath, England in 1963. He played Hamlet in &quot;avant garde&quot; theatrical and radio productions of the play.

A distinguished theatre director, he earned a Tony Award nomination for his 1974 Broadway staging of &quot;Ulysses in Nighttown&quot;, a theatrical adaptation of the &quot;Nighttown&quot; section of James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;. Meredith also shared a Special Tony Award with James Thurber for their collaboration on &quot;A Thurber Carnival&quot; (1960). In the late seventies, he directed Fionnula Flanagan&#x27;s one-woman multi-role play &quot;James Joyce&#x27;s Women&quot;, which toured for several years.

===Film===
Early in his career, Meredith attracted favorable attention, especially for playing George in a 1939 adaptation of John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; and as war correspondent Ernie Pyle in &quot;The Story of G.I. Joe&quot; (1945). He was featured in many 1940s films, including three—&quot;Second Chorus&quot; (1940), &quot;Diary of a Chambermaid&quot; (1946), and &quot;On Our Merry Way&quot; (1948) — co-starring his then-wife Paulette Goddard. As a result of the House Committee on Un-American Activities investigation, Meredith was placed on the Hollywood blacklist and was largely absent from film for the next decade, though he remained involved in stage plays and radio during this time.

Meredith was a favorite of director Otto Preminger, who cast him in &quot;Advise and Consent&quot; (1962), &quot;The Cardinal&quot; (1963), &quot;In Harm&#x27;s Way&quot; (1965), &quot;Hurry Sundown&quot; (1967), &quot;Skidoo&quot; (1968), and &quot;Such Good Friends&quot; (1971). He was in &quot;Madame X&quot; (with Lana Turner, 1966) and &quot;Stay Away Joe&quot; (1968), appearing as the father of Elvis Presley&#x27;s character. He was acclaimed by critics for his performance as Harry Greener in &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot; (1975) and received nominations for the BAFTA, Golden Globe, and Academy Award for best supporting actor. Meredith then played Rocky Balboa&#x27;s trainer Mickey Goldmill in the first three &quot;Rocky&quot; films (1976, 1979, and 1982). Though his character died in the third &quot;Rocky&quot; film, he returned briefly in a flashback in the fifth film, &quot;Rocky V&quot; (1990). His portrayal in the first film earned him his second consecutive nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. 

Meredith had a role in &quot;Foul Play&quot; (1978) with Chevy Chase and Goldie Hawn. He played an old Korean War veteran Captain J. G. Williams in &quot;The Last Chase&quot; (1981) with Lee Majors. He appeared in Ray Harryhausen&#x27;s last stop-motion feature &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot; (also 1981) in a supporting role. Meredith appeared in &quot;Santa Claus: The Movie&quot; (1985) and was the voice of Golobulus in &quot;G.I. Joe: The Movie&quot; (1987). In his last years, he played Jack Lemmon&#x27;s character&#x27;s sex-crazed 95-year-old father in &quot;Grumpy Old Men&quot; (1993) and its sequel, &quot;Grumpier Old Men&quot; (1995).

Meredith directed the movie &quot;The Man on the Eiffel Tower&quot; (1949) starring Charles Laughton, which was produced by Irving Allen. Meredith also was billed in a supporting role in this film. In 1970, he directed (as well as co-wrote and played a supporting role in) &quot;The Yin and the Yang of Mr. Go&quot;, an espionage caper starring James Mason and Jeff Bridges.

===Television===
Meredith appeared in four starring roles in the anthology TV series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, tying him with Jack Klugman for the most appearances on the show in a starring role.

In his first appearance in 1959, &quot;Time Enough at Last&quot;, he portrayed a henpecked bookworm who finds himself the sole survivor of an unspecified apocalypse which leads him to contemplate suicide until he discovers the ruins of the library. In 1961&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Dingle, the Strong&quot;, Meredith played the title character, a timid weakling who receives superhuman strength from an extraterrestrial experiment in human nature. Also that year in &quot;The Obsolete Man&quot;, Meredith portrayed a librarian sentenced to death in a dystopic totalitarian society. Lastly, in 1963&#x27;s &quot;Printer&#x27;s Devil&quot;, Meredith portrayed the Devil himself. He later played two additional roles in Rod Serling&#x27;s other anthology series, &quot;Night Gallery&quot;. Meredith was the narrator for &quot;Twilight Zone: The Movie&quot; in 1983.

Meredith appeared in various western series, such as &quot;Rawhide&quot; (four times), &quot;The Virginian&quot; (twice), &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, &quot;Branded&quot;, &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, &quot;The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters&quot;, &quot;Laredo&quot;, &quot;Bonanza&quot;, and &quot;Daniel Boone&quot;. In 1963, he appeared as Vincent Marion in a five-part episode of the last season of the Warner Bros. ABC detective series &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;. He appeared three times in &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot; (1963–1964), starring Gene Barry.
Meredith was also well known for his portrayal of the Penguin in the television series &quot;Batman&quot; from 1966 to 1968 and in the 1966 film based on the TV series. His role as the Penguin was so well-received that the show&#x27;s writers always had a script featuring the Penguin ready whenever Meredith was available. Meredith made 21 appearances on the series as the Penguin. He also made a brief cameo appearance as the Penguin in the 1968 episode of &quot;The Monkees&quot; titled &quot;Monkees Blow Their Minds&quot;.

From 1972 to 1973, Meredith played V. C. R. Cameron, director of &quot;Probe Control&quot;, in the television movie/pilot &quot;Probe&quot; and then in &quot;Search&quot;, the subsequent TV series (the name was changed to avoid conflict with a program on PBS).

Meredith won an Emmy Award as Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy or Drama Special for the 1977 television film &quot;Tail Gunner Joe&quot;, a fictionalized study of U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy, the anticommunist politician active in the 1950s. He was cast as crusading lawyer Joseph Welch.

In 1992, Meredith narrated &quot;The Chaplin Puzzle,&quot; a television documentary that provides a rare insight into Charles Chaplin&#x27;s work, &quot;circa&quot; 1914, at Keystone Studios and Essanay, where Chaplin developed his Tramp character. Coincidentally, Meredith married actress Paulette Goddard in 1944 following her divorce from Chaplin.

== Military service ==
In 1942, Meredith enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II, reaching the rank of captain. After transferring to the Office of War Information, he made training and education films for the U.S. armed forces.
In 1943 he performed in the USAAF&#x27;s recruiting short &quot;The Rear Gunner&quot; and the U.S. Army training film &quot;A Welcome to Britain&quot; for troops heading to the UK in preparation for the liberation of Europe.
He was released from duty in 1944 to work on the movie &quot;The Story of G.I. Joe&quot;, in which he played the war correspondent Ernie Pyle. He was discharged from the USAAF in 1945.

==Other work==
Meredith also performed voice-over work. He provided the narration for the war film &quot;A Walk in the Sun&quot; (1945). As a nod to his longtime association with the original &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; series, he served as narrator for the 1983 film based on the series. He was a TV commercial voice for such clients as Bulova, Honda, Pioneer, Stokely-Van Camp, United Airlines, and Freakies breakfast cereal. He also produced and narrated &quot;Works Of Calder&quot;, a 1950 film directed by Herbert Matter with a soundtrack by the composer John Cage.

He supplied the narration for the 1974–75 ABC Saturday morning series &quot;&quot; and was the voice of Puff in the series of animated adaptations of the Peter, Paul, and Mary song &quot;Puff, the Magic Dragon&quot;. In the mid-1950s, he was one of four narrators of the NBC and syndicated public affairs program, &quot;The Big Story&quot; (1949–58), which focused on courageous journalists. In 1991, he narrated a track on The Chieftains&#x27; album of traditional Christmas music and carols, &quot;The Bells of Dublin&quot;.

He acted in the Kenny G music video of &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot;, which was released in 1994. He played the main character, a projectionist at a movie theater. In 1994, he published his autobiography, &quot;So Far, So Good&quot;.

His last role before his death was the portrayal of both the Hamilton Wofford and Covington Wofford characters in the 1996 video game &quot;Ripper&quot; by Take-Two Interactive. Meredith was considered to play the Penguin&#x27;s father in the 1992 Tim Burton film &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, but illness prevented him from appearing and the role was taken by Paul Reubens.

==Personal life==
Meredith was married four times. His first wife, Helen Derby Berrien Meredith—the daughter of American Cyanamid president Harry L. Derby—died by suicide in 1940, nearly five years after their divorce. His next two wives, Margaret Perry (actress) and Paulette Goddard, were actresses; Goddard suffered a miscarriage in 1944. Meredith&#x27;s last marriage, to Kaja Sundsten, lasted 46 years and produced two children, Jonathan (a musician) and Tala (a painter).

Meredith was a lifelong Democrat and donor to the party. He wrote in his 1994 autobiography &quot;So Far, So Good&quot; that he had violent mood swings caused by cyclothymia, a form of bipolar disorder.

On September 9, 1997, Meredith died at age 89 from complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and melanoma, and his remains were cremated.

<doc id="335068" wikidata="Q719568" url="?curid=335068" title="John Cornyn">
<text>John Cornyn III ( ; born February 2, 1952) is an American politician, attorney, and former jurist serving as the senior United States senator from Texas, a seat he has held since 2002. A member of the Republican Party, he served on the Texas Supreme Court from 1991 to 1997 and as the attorney general of Texas from 1999 to 2002.

Born in Houston, Cornyn is a graduate of Trinity University and St. Mary&#x27;s University School of Law and received an LL.M. degree from the University of Virginia School of Law. He was a judge on Texas&#x27;s 37th District Court from 1985 to 1991. He was elected an associate justice of the Texas Supreme Court, where he served from 1991 to 1997. While serving on that court, Cornyn played an important role in crafting its decision to uphold the constitutionality of Texas&#x27;s anti-sodomy law (later ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot;).

In 1998, Cornyn was elected Attorney General of Texas, serving one term before winning a seat in the U.S. Senate in 2002. He was reelected in 2008, 2014, and 2020. Cornyn chaired the National Republican Senatorial Committee from 2009 to 2013, and served as the Senate majority whip for the 114th and 115th Congresses.

==Early life, education, and legal career==

Cornyn was born in Houston, the second child of Atholene Gale Cornyn (née Danley) and John Cornyn II, a colonel in the U.S. Air Force. He attended the American School in Japan after his family moved to Tokyo in 1968, and graduated from it in 1969. In 1973, he graduated from Trinity University, where he majored in journalism and was a member of Chi Delta Tau. Cornyn earned a Juris Doctor from St. Mary&#x27;s University School of Law in 1977 and an LL.M. from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1995. He was named the St. Mary&#x27;s Distinguished Law School Graduate in 1994, and a Trinity University Distinguished Alumnus in 2001.

In 1988, Cornyn attended a two-week seminar at Oxford University, jointly hosted by the National Judicial College at the University of Nevada, Reno and Florida State University’s College of Law. The seminar, held on the Oxford campus, was not academically affiliated with the university.

Cornyn served as a district judge in San Antonio for six years before being elected as a Republican in 1990 to the Texas Supreme Court, on which he served for seven years.

==Texas attorney general==
===1998 election===
In 1998, Cornyn ran for Texas attorney general. In the March Republican primary, Railroad Commissioner Barry Williamson received 38% of the vote, and Cornyn, a former Texas Supreme Court justice, received 32%. In the April runoff election, Cornyn defeated Williamson, 58% to 42%. Cornyn won the general election with 54% of the vote; he defeated Jim Mattox, a former Texas attorney general (1983–1991) and U.S. representative. Cornyn was the first Republican-elected attorney general of Texas since Reconstruction, and was sworn in by then-Governor George W. Bush.

===Tenure===

In September 2000, Cornyn created the Texas Internet Bureau to investigate illegal internet practices. The Internet Bureau was funded through an $800,000 grant from Governor Bush’s office, and its mission was to &quot;help fight cybercrime in Texas, including consumer fraud, hacker break-ins, and online child exploitation&quot;. Cornyn investigated fraudulent Medicare and Medicaid claims.

Cornyn was criticized by civil rights groups for failing to investigate in a timely manner the false drug convictions of numerous African Americans in Tulia, Texas. On September 6, 2002, &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; reported that Cornyn had announced that his office would investigate the 1999 drug bust, where the testimony of one narcotics agent led to the arrests of 46 people, 43 of whom were Black.

In 2005, Cornyn was mentioned as a possible replacement for Supreme Court Justices Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor and William Rehnquist.

==United States Senate==
===Elections===

==== 2002 ====
In the 2002 Republican primary, Cornyn faced five opponents. Cornyn defeated his closest Republican challenger, the self-financed, Dallas-based international physician Bruce Rusty Lang, by a ten-to-one margin. In the general election, Cornyn defeated Democratic nominee Ron Kirk in a campaign that cost each candidate over $9 million.

==== 2008 ====

Texas had not elected a Democrat in a statewide election since 1994, and according to Rasmussen Reports polling, Cornyn had an approval rating of 50% in October 2008. Christian activist Larry Kilgore of Mansfield challenged Cornyn in the Republican primary, but Cornyn easily defeated him. Texas Representative Rick Noriega won the March4 Democratic primary against Gene Kelly, Ray McMurrey, and Rhett Smith. Yvonne Adams Schick was the Libertarian Party&#x27;s nominee, and the Green Party of Texas sought ballot access for its candidate, David B. Collins. The same Rasmussen poll showed Cornyn leading Noriega 47% to 43%, suggesting that the race might prove unexpectedly competitive, but most polls showed a much wider margin, and Cornyn was reelected.

==== 2014 ====

Cornyn was reelected in 2014, and according to the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot;, &quot;never broke a sweat.&quot; He won the March Republican primary with 59% of the vote against Houston-area congressman Steve Stockman. In the general election, he raised $14 million, outspending Democratic nominee David Alameel by nearly 3-1. Cornyn won again by over 20 points.

==== 2020 ====
Cornyn was reelected to a fourth term in 2020 in the closest of his Senate campaigns. He won the primary with 76% of the vote, and then defeated Democrat MJ Hegar in a race that the Cook Political Report had initially rated &quot;Likely Republican&quot; but then shifted to &quot;Lean Republican&quot;. Cornyn received 5,962,983 votes—more than any Republican Senate candidate had ever received before, breaking the record set by Pete Wilson of California in 1988. Hegar also set a record, getting more votes than any losing Democrat since Leo T. McCarthy in the 1988 California Senate race.

====2026====
Cornyn has announced his intention to run for a fifth term for the Senate in 2026. Current Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is considered as a potential primary challenger to Cornyn.

===Tenure===

In 2004, Cornyn co-founded and became the co-chairman of the U.S. Senate India Caucus. In December 2006, he was selected by his colleagues to join the five-person Republican Senate leadership team as Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference.

In 2005, Cornyn gained notice by connecting the Supreme Court&#x27;s reluctance to hear arguments for sustaining Terri Schiavo&#x27;s life with the recent murders of Judge Joan Lefkow&#x27;s husband and mother, as well as the courtroom murder of Judge Rowland Barnes. Cornyn said: &quot;I don&#x27;t know if there is a cause-and-effect connection, but we have seen some recent episodes of courthouse violence in this country. I wonder whether there may be some connection between the perception in some quarters on some occasions, where judges are making political decisions, yet are unaccountable to the public, that it builds up and builds up, and building up to the point where some people engage in violence.&quot; His statement and a similar one by House Majority Leader Tom DeLay were widely denounced, including by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Cornyn later said that the statement was taken out of context, and for that reason, he regretted the statement.

On May 18, 2007, Cornyn was involved in a verbal altercation with Senator John McCain. During a meeting on immigration, McCain and Cornyn had a shouting match when Cornyn started questioning the number of judicial appeals that illegal immigrants could receive. McCain responded by yelling profanity and insults at Cornyn, and followed up with the assertion, &quot;I know more about this than anyone else in the room.&quot; Previously, Cornyn told McCain: &quot;Wait a second here. I&#x27;ve been sitting in here for all of these negotiations, and you just parachute in here on the last day. You&#x27;re out of line.&quot;
As chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Cornyn was a strong supporter of Norm Coleman&#x27;s various court challenges to the 2008 election certification of the Minnesota U.S. Senate race. Cornyn advocated for Coleman to bring the case before the federal court and said the trial and appeals could take years to complete. Cornyn threatened that Republicans would wage a &quot;World War III&quot; if Senate Democrats had attempted to seat Democratic candidate Al Franken before the appeals were complete. Coleman conceded after the Minnesota Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Franken had won the election.

Cornyn voted to confirm Samuel Alito as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court and John Roberts as Chief Justice. In September 2005, during Roberts&#x27;s Supreme Court hearings, Cornyn&#x27;s staff passed out bingo cards to reporters. He asked them to stamp their card every time a Democrat on the Judiciary Committee used terms such as &quot;far right&quot; or &quot;extremist&quot;. On July 24, 2009, Cornyn announced his intention to vote against President Obama&#x27;s Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor, saying that she might rule &quot;from a liberal, activist perspective&quot;.

On the day of Obama&#x27;s inauguration, it was reported that Cornyn would prevent Hillary Clinton from being confirmed as secretary of state by unanimous floor vote that day. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid&#x27;s spokesman reported to the Associated Press that a roll call vote for the Clinton confirmation would be held instead on the following day, January 21, 2009, and that it was expected Clinton would &quot;receive overwhelming bipartisan support&quot;. The vote was 94–2 in her favor, with only Senators Jim DeMint and David Vitter voting in opposition.

On March 18, 2020, Cornyn blamed the COVID-19 pandemic on cultural practices in China and mistakenly blamed China for the MERS and swine flu epidemics. His comments were criticized by some Democrats and the National Council of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. At the time, the consensus among researchers was that coronavirus had originated at a wet market in Wuhan, China.

===Senate Majority Whip===
On November 14, 2012, Cornyn was elected Senate Minority Whip by his peers.

Cornyn was named Senate Majority Whip after the 2014 election, in which Republicans gained a Senate majority.

After the death of Associate Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016, Cornyn said that anyone Obama nominated to replace him would have a difficult confirmation process and feel like a piñata. He also said that no serious candidate would accept a nomination knowing that they would not be confirmed. When Obama nominated Merrick Garland to replace Scalia, Cornyn said that even if the president has the constitutional authority to nominate someone, the Senate has full authority on how to proceed. Cornyn also said that the voice of the people should play a role, and that the &quot;only way to empower the American people&quot; was having the vacancy be filled by the winner of the upcoming presidential election, so no hearings on Garland should be held. The Senate did not vote on Garland&#x27;s nomination, which expired after the November election of President Donald Trump. Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to the seat, and Gorsuch was confirmed. In September 2020, Cornyn supported a vote on Trump&#x27;s nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy caused by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. In March 2016, he took the position that the Senate should not consider Obama&#x27;s Supreme Court nominee.
On June 8, 2017, during a committee hearing whose announced topic was the Russian interference in the 2016 election and Comey&#x27;s dismissal as FBI director, Cornyn opted instead to spend his time questioning James Comey on Hillary Clinton&#x27;s email controversy.

In September 2018, during the Supreme Court nomination hearings for Brett Kavanaugh, Cornyn accused the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee of devolving into mob rule by breaking the rules of decorum when asking for postponement or adjournment of the hearing to obtain or review documents from Kavanaugh&#x27;s time working for the George W. Bush administration. Cornyn said that it was hard to believe the Democrats&#x27; claim that they could not properly assess Kavanaugh without the documents because it seemed that their minds were already made up.

===2024 Senate Majority Leader election===
In February 2024, Cornyn announced he would run for Republican leader after Mitch McConnell announced he would step down from his position at the end of the year.

Following the 2024 U.S. elections, in which the Republicans carried the Senate, Cornyn was one of three announced candidates vying to be the next Senate Majority Leader. The others were Rick Scott and John Thune.

On November 12, 2024, Senator Mike Lee hosted a candidates forum, and the election took place the next day. It was held in a closed-door Republican caucus setting, and senators&#x27; votes were not publicized. Cornyn lost to Thune on the second ballot, 24-29.

==Political positions==

Political scientists John M. Sides and Daniel J. Hopkins characterized Cornyn as &quot;very conservative&quot; in 2015. In 2013, &quot;National Journal&quot; ranked Cornyn the 14th-most conservative Senator. &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; considered him a reliable ally of President George W. Bush on most issues. In 2023, the Lugar Center ranked Cornyn fifth among senators for bipartisanship.

===Abortion===

Cornyn opposes abortion.

In 2007, Cornyn voted against expanding federal funding for stem cell research that utilized human embryonic stem cells. Cornyn instead pushed for &quot;several alternatives that would use adult and cord blood stem cells for research [as those] methods have proven to be more productive, and they do not harm or destroy human embryos.&quot; As an alternative, Cornyn supported the Alternative Pluripotent Stem Cell Therapies Enhancement Act to aid research into techniques of deriving pluripotent stem cells without harming or destroying human embryos.

In 2019, when asked about an Alabama law that prohibited abortions, including in cases of rape or incest, Cornyn said it was an &quot;Alabama state issue&quot;.

===Civil rights and law enforcement===

In the 2004 debate surrounding the Federal Marriage Amendment, Cornyn released an advance copy of a speech he was to give at The Heritage Foundation. In the speech, he wrote, &quot;It does not affect your daily life very much if your neighbor marries a box turtle. But that does not mean it is right... Now you must raise your children up in a world where that union of man and box turtle is on the same legal footing as man and wife.&quot; According to his office, he removed the reference to the box turtle in the actual speech, but &quot;The Washington Post&quot; ran the quote, as did &quot;The Daily Show&quot;.

Cornyn sponsored a bill to allow law enforcement to force anyone arrested or detained by federal authorities to provide samples of their DNA, which would be recorded in a central database. He voted to recommend a constitutional ban on flag desecration and for a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between one man and one woman. He also voted for the reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act and extending its wiretap provision.

In a February 24, 2019, tweet, Cornyn mocked dictatorship, centralized power and democratic socialism by quoting Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini as saying &quot;We were the first to assert that the more complicated the forms assumed by civilization, the more restricted the freedom of the individual must become.&quot;

On June 25, 2022, after the Supreme Court overturned &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; and &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot;, Cornyn tweeted, &quot;Now do Plessy vs Ferguson/Brown vs Board of Education&quot; in response to former President Barack Obama condemning the reversal of &quot;Roe&quot; in part because of its standing as &quot;50 years of precedent&quot;. Representative Joaquin Castro, who interpreted the tweet as advocating the return of segregation in schools, condemned the tweet as racist. Cornyn continued in another tweet, &quot;Thank goodness some SCOTUS precedents are overruled&quot;; &quot;Brown&quot; had overturned more than 50 years of precedent regarding the doctrine of &quot;separate but equal&quot; as defined by &quot;Plessy&quot;.

===President Donald Trump===
Cornyn has been described as an &quot;immutable Trump ally&quot;. He frequently praised Trump during most of his presidential term. But in the weeks before his reelection campaign, amid a tightening race with Democratic nominee MJ Hegar, Cornyn began to distance himself from Trump. He said that he praised Trump in public but expressed disagreement with him in private.

During Trump&#x27;s presidency, Cornyn and fellow Texas Senator Ted Cruz contributed to the appointment of multiple conservative judges to federal courts with jurisdiction over Texas.

Cornyn repeatedly defended Trump&#x27;s decision to siphon resources from the Pentagon in order to build a wall on the Mexico border. In March and September 2019, he voted to ratify the maneuver, opposing congressional attempts to block Trump&#x27;s action. But in late October 2020, as Cornyn was trying to distance himself from Trump, he claimed that he had never supported Trump&#x27;s maneuver and that he opposed it.

Cornyn warned Trump about anticipated negative effects of restructuring tariffs on Mexican exports, saying, &quot;We&#x27;re holding a gun to our own heads by doing this.&quot; In January 2018, he was one of 36 Republican senators to sign a letter to Trump requesting that he preserve the North American Free Trade Agreement by modernizing it for the 21st-century economy. Cornyn urged Trump to restart trade talks on the Trans Pacific Partnership, which Trump called &quot;a disaster&quot;.

In June 2020, amid reports that Russia had paid the Taliban bounties to kill American soldiers and that Trump had been briefed on the subject months earlier, Cornyn defended an assertion by Trump that he had never been briefed on the subject. Cornyn said, &quot;I think the president can&#x27;t single-handedly remember everything, I&#x27;m sure, that he&#x27;s briefed on.&quot;

In response to reports that Trump would not be attending Joe Biden&#x27;s inauguration, Cornyn told Cruz and other lawmakers &quot;see you there&quot;, implying that he planned to attend, which he did.

On May 28, 2021, Cornyn voted against creating an independent commission to investigate the January 6 United States Capitol attack.

===Foreign policy and national security===

In December 2010, Cornyn was one of 26 senators to vote against the ratification of New Start, a nuclear arms reduction treaty between the United States and Russia that obliges both countries to have no more than 1,550 strategic warheads and 700 launchers deployed during the next seven years, and provides a continuation of on-site inspections that halted when START I expired the previous year. It was the first arms treaty with Russia in eight years.

In 2013, Cornyn said that, despite the sequester, the Pentagon would actually see its budget increase.

In April 2018, Cornyn was one of eight Republican senators to sign a letter to Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin and acting Secretary of State John Sullivan expressing &quot;deep concern&quot; over a United Nations report exposing &quot;North Korean sanctions evasion involving Russia and China&quot; and asserting that the findings &quot;demonstrate an elaborate and alarming military-venture between rogue, tyrannical states to avoid United States and international sanctions and inflict terror and death upon thousands of innocent people&quot; while calling it &quot;imperative that the United States provides a swift and appropriate response to the continued use of chemical weapons used by President Assad and his forces, and works to address the shortcomings in sanctions enforcement&quot;.

Cornyn supported U.S. involvement in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen. In December 2018 he said that the U.S. should stand with Saudi Arabia despite the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, saying: &quot;Saudi Arabia is fighting a proxy war against Iran in Yemen, and an overreaction, in my view, would mean that we cancel arms sales and simply abandon our ally.&quot;

As Majority Whip, Cornyn filed a resolution welcoming Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was to address a joint meeting of Congress in March 2015, a resolution co-sponsored only by Republicans. Vice President Biden and numerous Senate and House Democrats said they would not attend the address. Cornyn supported the Senate resolution expressing objection to UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which called Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories a flagrant violation of international law.

Cornyn has been a vocal critic of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. In August 2018, Cornyn urged the Trump administration to impose sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Act against Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim minority in western China&#x27;s Xinjiang region. In a &quot;Washington Post&quot; opinion piece, Cornyn wrote that widespread adoption of Huawei technology could increase vulnerability to cyberattacks and endanger NATO troops engaged on 5G-equipped battlefields.
Cornyn heightened his anti-China advocacy during the COVID-19 pandemic and the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. He has been widely accused of spreading the misinformation that MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome, a disease first reported from the Arabian Peninsula) and the Swine Flu (an epidemic that first emerged in North America) originated from China, because allegedly &quot;people eat bats and snakes and dogs and things like that.&quot; In addition to charges of racism, a &quot;Washington Post&quot; article has noted that &quot;none of the diseases he mentioned are linked to dogs and snakes&quot; and that rattlesnake-eating is not popular in China, but is in Cornyn&#x27;s own Texas.

Upon the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, Cornyn tweeted that the U.S. still has 30,000 troops in Taiwan (formally the Republic of China); in fact, the U.S. has kept no troops in Taiwan since it normalized relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Cornyn has since deleted the inaccurate tweet and refused to respond to queries about it.

===Economy===

Cornyn voted to permanently repeal the estate tax and raise the estate tax exemption to $5 million. He voted in favor of $350 billion in tax cuts over 11 years and supported making the George W. Bush tax cuts permanent. He opposed extending the 2011 payroll tax holiday. He voted for the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 but against the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009.

In 2008, Cornyn voted for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), also known as the &quot;Wall Street bailout&quot;, and later voted to end the program.

===Environment===

Cornyn voted against a measure recognizing that humans are causing climate change. He was one of 22 senators to sign a letter to Trump urging him to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement. In May 2019, Cornyn said it was important that the United States take measures to combat climate change, but condemned the Green New Deal as proposed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In April 2020, he stated that climate scientists&#x27; models of the effects of climate change do not use the &quot;scientific method&quot;.

In 2005, Cornyn voted against including oil and gas smokestacks in mercury regulations. He voted against factoring global warming into federal project planning, and against banning drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. He also voted against removing oil and gas exploration subsidies. During his tenure in the Senate, Cornyn has scored 0% on the League of Conservation Voters&#x27; environmental scorecard, a system of ranking politicians according to their voting record on environmental legislation.

===Health care===

Cornyn opposes the Affordable Care Act. He voted against it in 2009, and played a leading role in the attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2017. He voted against the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. Cornyn said that Senator Ted Cruz&#x27;s 2013 efforts to defund the Affordable Care Act by threatening to default on the U.S. government&#x27;s debt obligations were &quot;unachievable&quot;, adding, &quot;the shutdown did not help our cause. What did help our cause was the president&#x27;s implementation of the Affordable Care Act, which has overwhelmed everything else. I don&#x27;t hear anyone thinking that another government shutdown is the way to achieve our goals.&quot; Cornyn joined other Republican leaders to block Cruz&#x27;s procedural move to reject an increase in the debt ceiling.

===Guns===
In January 2014, Cornyn introduced the &quot;Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act&quot;. The bill would provide interstate reciprocity for persons with concealed weapons permits. Cornyn described the bill: &quot;It&#x27;s like a driver&#x27;s license. It doesn&#x27;t trump state laws. Say you have a carry permit in Texas; then you use it in another state that has a concealed-carry law.&quot; He received an &quot;A&quot; rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund in 2003 and an &quot;A+&quot; in 2014 and 2022. Cornyn continued to support Concealed Carry Reciprocity as of 2018, with the Republican-held House of Representatives passing a bill in late 2017 with this language attached to gun control measures from the Senate&#x27;s Fix NICS bill.

In 2017, Cornyn helped Democrats pass legislation designed to aid federal agencies in alerting, reporting and recording gun purchases by creating a universal cross-agency database.

In 2022, in the wake of the Robb Elementary School shooting, Cornyn opposed further background check laws and those limiting the types of weapons that adults may purchase. He later became one of ten Republican senators to support a bipartisan agreement on gun control, which included a red flag provision, support for state crisis intervention orders, funding for school safety resources, stronger background checks for buyers under 21, and penalties for straw purchases.

===LGBTQ rights===

While serving on the Texas Supreme Court in the 1990s, Cornyn ruled with the majority to overturn a lower court ruling, &quot;State v. Morales&quot;, that had found Texas&#x27;s anti-sodomy laws to be unconstitutional. During oral arguments, he questioned the merits of the case, asking how the anti-sodomy laws harmed gay people if the laws were not enforced. According to Yale Law School professor William Eskridge, Cornyn &quot;engineered the &quot;Morales&quot; majority&quot; that saved the sodomy law. When running for the Senate in 2002, Cornyn defended the law. In 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Texas&#x27;s sodomy law in &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot;, ruling that anti-sodomy laws are unconstitutional.

After &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot;, Cornyn condemned the &quot;startling display of judicial activism that so threatens our fundamental institutions and our values&quot;. He said he worried that the Supreme Court would next overturn the Defense of Marriage Act, which prohibited recognition of same-sex marriage at the federal level, and he played a leading role in trying to introduce a constitutional amendment to prohibit same-sex marriage. Cornyn argued that recognition of same-sex marriage harmed people in heterosexual marriages. He claimed that children raised by gay couples are &quot;at higher risk of a host of social ills&quot;, such as crime, drug use and dropping out of school, and that same-sex marriage would put &quot;more and more children at risk through a radical social experiment&quot;. Cornyn opposed allowing gay couples to adopt children.

In 2012, when President Obama announced his support for same-sex marriage, Cornyn criticized Obama and accused him of trying to &quot;divide the country&quot;.

In 2021, when President Joe Biden reversed Trump&#x27;s ban on transgender troops serving in the military, Cornyn accused Biden of dividing the country.

In 2022, at the Supreme Court confirmation hearings of Ketanji Brown Jackson, Cornyn expressed his position that state governments ought to have the power to ban same-sex marriage. The Supreme Court held in Obergefell v. Hodges that the 14th amendment barred states from doing so.

===Victims&#x27; rights===

Cornyn opposes profiting from memorabilia tied to convicted murderers, and has made several unsuccessful attempts to pass laws against it.

===Election law===
In 2021, Cornyn helped Senate Republicans filibuster national election reform legislation. Cornyn described the bill, which exclusively received support from members of the Democratic Party, as a &quot;politically-motivated federal takeover of our elections.&quot;

===Removal of Confederate statues===

Cornyn opposes the removal of statues relating to the Confederate States of America. He has said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think we can go back and erase our history by removing statues.&quot;

==Electoral history==



































==Personal life==
Cornyn and his wife, Sandy Hansen, have two daughters. Cornyn receives pensions from three separate state and local governments in addition to his Senate salary.

As of 2018, according to OpenSecrets.org, Cornyn&#x27;s net worth was more than $1.8 million.

<text>Barbara Jill Walters (September 25, 1929December 30, 2022) was an American broadcast journalist and television personality. Known for her interviewing ability and popularity with viewers, she appeared as a host of numerous television programs, including &quot;Today&quot;, the &quot;ABC Evening News&quot;, &quot;20/20&quot;, and &quot;The View&quot;. Walters was a working journalist from 1951 until her retirement in 2016. Walters was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 1989, received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the NATAS in 2000 and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2007.

Walters began her career at WNBT-TV (NBC&#x27;s flagship station in New York) in 1953 as writer-producer of a news-and-information program aimed at the juvenile audience, &quot;Ask the Camera&quot;, hosted by Sandy Becker. She joined the staff of the network&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; show in the early 1960s as a writer and segment producer of women&#x27;s-interest stories. Her popularity with viewers led to her receiving more airtime, and in 1974 she became co-host of the program, the first woman to hold such a position on an American news program. During 1976 she continued to be a pioneer for women in broadcasting while becoming the first U.S. female co-anchor of a network evening news program, alongside Harry Reasoner on the &quot;ABC Evening News&quot;. Walters was a correspondent, producer and co-host on the ABC newsmagazine &quot;20/20&quot; from 1979 to 2004. She became known for an annual special aired on ABC, &quot;Barbara Walters&#x27; 10 Most Fascinating People&quot;.

During her career, Walters interviewed every sitting U.S. president and first lady from Richard and Pat Nixon to Barack and Michelle Obama. She also interviewed both Donald Trump and Joe Biden, although not when either was president. She also gained acclaim and notoriety for interviewing subjects such as Fidel Castro, Anwar Sadat, Menachem Begin, Katharine Hepburn, Sean Connery, Monica Lewinsky, Hugo Chávez, Vladimir Putin, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Jiang Zemin, and Bashar al-Assad.

Walters created, produced, and co-hosted the ABC daytime talk show &quot;The View&quot;; she appeared on the program from 1997 until 2014. Later she continued to host several special reports for &quot;20/20&quot; as well as documentary series for Investigation Discovery. Her final on-air appearance for ABC News was in 2015. Walters last publicly appeared in 2016.

== Early life ==
Barbara Jill Walters was born in Boston on September 25, 1929, the daughter of Dena (née Seletsky) and Lou Walters (born Louis Abraham Warmwater); her parents were children of Russian Jewish immigrants. Her paternal grandfather, Abraham Isaac Waremwasser, was born in the Polish city of Łódź and emigrated to England where he changed his surname to Warmwater. Walters&#x27; father was born in London in 1898 and moved to New York City with his father and two brothers on August 28, 1909. His mother and four sisters arrived there the following year.

During Walters&#x27; childhood, her father managed the Latin Quarter nightclub in Boston, which was owned in partnership with E. M. Loew. In 1942, her father opened the club&#x27;s now-famous New York location. He also worked as a Broadway producer and produced the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies of 1943&quot;; he was also the entertainment director for the Tropicana Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. He imported the &quot;Folies Bergère&quot; stage show from Paris to the resort&#x27;s main showroom. Walters&#x27; older brother, Burton, was 14 months old when he died of pneumonia. Her elder sister, Jacqueline, was born with mental disabilities and died of ovarian cancer in 1985.

According to Walters, her father made and lost several fortunes throughout his life in show business. He was a booking agent, and (unlike her uncles in the shoe and dress businesses) his job was not very stable. During the good times, she recalled her father taking her to the rehearsals of the nightclub shows he directed and produced. The actresses and dancers would make a huge fuss over her and twirl her around until she was dizzy, after which she said her father would take her out to get hot dogs.

Walters said that being surrounded by celebrities when she was young kept her from being &quot;in awe&quot; of them. When she was a young woman, her father lost his night clubs and the family&#x27;s penthouse on Central Park West. As Walters recalled, &quot;He had a breakdown. He went down to live in our house in Florida, and then the government took the house, and they took the car, and they took the furniture. [...] My mother should have married the way her friends did, to a man who was a doctor or who was in the dress business.&quot; During her childhood in Miami Beach, she briefly lived with the mobster Bill Dwyer.

Walters attended Lawrence School, a public school in Brookline, Massachusetts; she left halfway through fifth grade when her father moved the family to Miami Beach in 1939. She continued attending public school in Miami Beach. After her father moved the family to New York City, she spent eighth grade at the private Ethical Culture Fieldston School, after which the family moved back to Miami Beach. She then went back to New York City after tenth grade, where she attended Birch Wathen School, another private school. In 1951, she earned a Bachelor of Arts in English from Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers, New York.

== Career ==
===Early career===
Walters was employed for about a year at a small advertising agency in New York City and began working at the NBC network&#x27;s flagship station WNBT-TV (now WNBC), doing publicity and writing press releases. In 1953 she produced a 15-minute children&#x27;s program, &quot;Ask the Camera&quot;, which was directed by Roone Arledge. She also started producing for TV host Igor Cassini (Cholly Knickerbocker), but left the network after Cassini pressured her to marry him and started a fistfight with the man she was interested in. She went to WPIX to produce the &quot;Eloise McElhone Show&quot;, which was canceled in 1954. She became a writer on &quot;The Morning Show&quot; at CBS in 1955.

===&quot;The Today Show&quot;===
After a few years working at Tex McCrary Inc. as a publicist and as a writer at &quot;Redbook&quot; magazine, Walters joined NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Today Show&quot; as a writer and researcher in 1961. She moved up becoming the show&#x27;s regular &quot;&quot;Today&quot; Girl,&quot; handling lighter assignments and the weather. In her autobiography, she described this era before the Women&#x27;s Movement as a time when it was believed that nobody would take a woman seriously reporting &quot;hard news.&quot; Previous &quot;&quot;Today&quot; Girls&quot; (whom Walters called &quot;tea pourers&quot;) included Florence Henderson, Helen O&#x27;Connell, Estelle Parsons, and Lee Meriwether. Within a year, she had become a reporter-at-large developing, writing, and editing her own reports and interviews. One very well-received film segment was &quot;A Day in the Life of a Nun.&quot; Another was about the daily life of a Playboy Bunny.

Beginning in 1971, Walters hosted her own local NBC affiliate show, &quot;Not for Women Only,&quot; which ran in the mornings after &quot;The Today Show.&quot; Walters had a great relationship with host Hugh Downs for years. When Frank McGee was named host in 1971, he refused to do joint interviews with Walters unless he was given the first three questions. She was not named co-host of the show until McGee&#x27;s death in 1974 when NBC officially designated Walters as the program&#x27;s first female co-host. She became the first female co-host of a U.S. news program.
=== &quot;ABC Evening News&quot; and &quot;20/20&quot; ===
Walters signed a five-year, $5 million contract with ABC, establishing her as the highest-paid news anchor, either male or female. She and Harry Reasoner co-anchored the &quot;ABC Evening News&quot; from 1976 to 1978, making her the first U.S. female network news anchor. Reasoner had a difficult relationship with Walters because he disliked having a co-anchor, even though he worked with former CBS colleague Howard K. Smith nightly on ABC for several years. Walters said that the tension between the two was because Reasoner did not want to work with a co-anchor and also because he was unhappy at ABC, not because he disliked Walters personally. In 1981, five years after the start of their short-lived ABC partnership and well after Reasoner returned to CBS News, Walters and her former co-anchor had a memorable (and cordial) &quot;20/20&quot; interview on the occasion of Reasoner&#x27;s new book release.

In 1979, Walters reunited with former &quot;The Today Show&quot; host Downs as a correspondent on the ABC newsmagazine &quot;20/20&quot;. She became Downs&#x27; co-host in 1984, and remained with the program until she retired as co-host in 2004. Throughout her career at ABC, Walters appeared on ABC news specials as a commentator, including presidential inaugurations and the coverage of the September 11 attacks. She was also chosen to be the moderator for the third and final debate between candidates Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford, held on the campus of the College of William and Mary at Phi Beta Kappa Memorial Hall in Williamsburg, Virginia, during the 1976 presidential election. In 1984, she moderated a presidential debate which was held at the Dana Center for the Humanities at Saint Anselm College in Goffstown, New Hampshire.

==== Interviews ====

Walters was known for &quot;personality journalism&quot; and her &quot;scoop&quot; interviews. In 1976, she first aired her highly rated, occasional, primetime &quot;Barbara Walters Specials&quot; interview program. Her first guests included a joint appearance by President-elect Jimmy Carter and Rosalynn Carter, and a separate interview with singer-actress Barbra Streisand. In November 1977, she landed the first joint interview with Egyptian president Anwar Al Sadat and Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin, while they were working out the terms of the eventual Egypt–Israel peace treaty. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, when she competed with Walter Cronkite to interview both world leaders, at the end of Cronkite&#x27;s interview, he is heard saying: &quot;Did Barbara get anything I didn&#x27;t get?&quot; Walters had sit-down interviews with world leaders, including the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and his wife, the Empress Farah Pahlavi; Russia&#x27;s Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin; China&#x27;s Jiang Zemin; the UK&#x27;s Margaret Thatcher; Cuba&#x27;s Fidel Castro, as well as India&#x27;s Indira Gandhi, Czechoslovakia&#x27;s Václav Havel, Libya&#x27;s Muammar al-Gaddafi, King Hussein of Jordan, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez and many others. Walters interviewed other influential people including pop icon Michael Jackson, Katharine Hepburn, &quot;Vogue&quot; editor Anna Wintour, and Laurence Olivier in 1980. Walters considered Robert Smithdas, a deaf-blind man who spent his life improving the lives of other individuals who are deaf-blind, as her most inspirational interviewee.

Walters was widely lampooned for asking actress Katharine Hepburn, &quot;If you were a tree, what kind would you be?&quot; On the last &quot;20/20&quot; television episode in which she appears, Walters showed a video of the Hepburn interview, showing the actress saying that she felt like a strong tree in her old age. Walters followed up with the question, &quot;What kind of a tree?&quot;, and Hepburn responded &quot;an oak&quot; because they do not get Dutch elm disease. According to Walters for years Hepburn refused her requests for an interview. When Hepburn finally agreed to one she said she wanted to meet Walters first. Walters walked in all smiles and ready to please, while Hepburn was at the top of the stairs and barked, &quot;You&#x27;re late. Have you brought me chocolates?&quot;
Walters had not but said she never showed up without them from then on. They had several other meetings later, mostly in Hepburn&#x27;s living room where she would give Walters her opinions. These included that careers and marriage did not mix, as well as her feeling that combining children with careers was out of the question. Walters said Hepburn&#x27;s opinions stuck with her so much, she could repeat them almost verbatim from that point onward.

Her television special about Cuban leader Fidel Castro aired on ABC-TV on June 9, 1977. Although the footage of her two days of interviewing Castro in Cuba showed his personality, in part, as freewheeling, charming, and humorous, she pointedly said to him, &quot;You allow no dissent. Your newspapers, radio, television, motion pictures are under state control.&quot; To this, he replied, &quot;Barbara, our concept of freedom of the press is not yours. If you asked us if a newspaper could appear here against socialism, I can say honestly no, it cannot appear. It would not be allowed by the party, the government, or the people. In that sense we do not have the freedom of the press that you possess in the U.S. And we are very satisfied about that.&quot; She concluded the broadcast saying, &quot;What we disagreed on most profoundly is the meaning of freedom—and that is what truly separates us.&quot; At the time, Walters kept quiet that she had seen New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, pitcher Whitey Ford, and several coaches in Cuba who were there to assist Cuban ballplayers.

On March 3, 1999, her interview with Monica Lewinsky was seen by a record 74 million viewers, the highest rating ever for a news program. Walters asked Lewinsky, &quot;What will you tell your children when you have them?&quot; Lewinsky replied, &quot;Mommy made a big mistake,&quot; at which point Walters brought the program to a dramatic conclusion, turning to the viewers and saying, &quot;... that is the understatement of the year.&quot;

&quot;Barbara Walters&#x27; 10 Most Fascinating People&quot; was aired annually starting in 1993. In 2000, she quizzed pop star Ricky Martin about his sexuality years before he publicly came out. The singer later said that &quot;he felt violated&quot;. In 2010, Walters said that she regretted having pushed him on the issue.

=== &quot;The View&quot; ===


Walters was a co-host of the daytime talk show &quot;The View;&quot; for 25 years she was also a co-executive producer of BarWall Productions alongside her business partner, Bill Geddie. Geddie and Walters were co-creators of the company. &quot;The View&quot; premiered on August 11, 1997. In the original opening credits Walters said the show is a forum for women of &quot;different generations, backgrounds, and views.&quot; &quot;Be careful what you wish for...&quot; was part of the opening credits of its second season. On &quot;The View&quot;, she won Daytime Emmy Awards for Best Talk Show in 2003 and Best Talk Show Host (with longtime host Joy Behar, moderator Whoopi Goldberg, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, and Sherri Shepherd) in 2009.

Walters retired from being a co-host on May 15, 2014. She returned as a guest co-host on an intermittent basis in 2014 and 2015 even in retirement.

=== Retirement ===
After leaving her role as &quot;20/20&quot; co-host in 2004, Walters remained a part-time contributor of special programming and interviews for ABC News until 2016. On March 7, 2010, Walters announced that she would no longer hold Oscar interviews but would still work for ABC and on &quot;The View&quot;.

On March 28, 2013, numerous media outlets reported that Walters would retire in May 2014 and that she would make the announcement on the show four days later. However, on the April 1 episode, she neither confirmed nor denied the retirement rumors; she said &quot;if and when I might have an announcement to make, I will do it on this program, I promise, and the paparazzi guys—you will be the last to know&quot;. Six weeks later Walters confirmed that she would be retiring from television hosting and interviewing, as originally reported; she made the official announcement on the May 13, 2013, episode of &quot;The View&quot;. She also announced that she would continue as the show&#x27;s executive producer for as long as it &quot;is on the air&quot;.

On June 10, 2014, it was announced she was &quot;coming out of retirement&quot; for a special &quot;20/20&quot; interview with Peter Rodger, the father of the perpetrator of the 2014 Isla Vista killings, Elliot Rodger. In 2015, Walters hosted special &quot;20/20&quot; episodes featuring interviews with Mary Kay Letourneau and Donald and Melania Trump. In 2015, Walters hosted the documentary series &quot;American Scandals&quot; on Investigation Discovery.

Walters continued to host &quot;10 Most Fascinating People&quot; on ABC in 2014 and 2015. Her last on-air interview was with Donald Trump for ABC News in December 2015, and she made her final public appearance in 2016. On January 1, 2023, ABC ran a special called &quot;Our Barbara&quot; and a &quot;20/20&quot; senior producer noted, &quot;For a number of years we kept her office just as is (after 2016), the papers came every day. Outside of her office she still retained her office extension.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Walters was married four times to three different men. Her first husband was Robert Henry Katz, a business executive and former Navy lieutenant. They married on June 20, 1955, at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. The marriage was reportedly annulled after eleven months, in 1957. Her second husband was Lee Guber, a theatrical producer and theater owner. They married on December 8, 1963, and divorced in 1976. After Walters had three miscarriages, the couple adopted a baby girl named Jacqueline Dena Guber (born in 1968 and adopted the same year; she was named for Walters&#x27; sister). Walters&#x27; third husband was Merv Adelson who at the time was the CEO of Lorimar Television. They married in 1981 and divorced in 1984. They remarried in 1986 and divorced for the second time in 1992.

Walters dated lawyer Roy Cohn in college; he said that he proposed marriage to Walters the night before her wedding to Lee Guber, but Walters denied this happened. She explained her lifelong devotion to Cohn as gratitude for his help in her adoption of her daughter, Jacqueline. In her autobiography, Walters says she also felt grateful to Cohn because of legal assistance he had provided to her father. According to Walters, her father was the subject of an arrest warrant for &quot;failure to appear&quot; after he failed to show up for a New York court date because the family was in Las Vegas; Cohn was able to have the charge dismissed. Walters testified as a character witness at Cohn&#x27;s 1986 disbarment trial.

Walters dated future U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan in the 1970s and was linked romantically to United States Senator John Warner in the 1990s. In Walters&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Audition&quot;, she wrote that she had an affair in the 1970s with Edward Brooke, then a married United States Senator from Massachusetts. It is not clear whether Walters also was married at the time. Walters said they ended the affair to protect their careers from scandal. In 2007, she dated Pulitzer Prize–winning gerontologist Robert Neil Butler. Walters was a close friend of Tom Brokaw, Woody Allen, Joan Rivers, and Fox News head Roger Ailes. In 2013, Walters said she regretted not having more children.

==Health issues and death==
In May 2010, Walters said she would be having an open-heart operation to replace a faulty aortic valve. She had known that she was suffering from aortic stenosis, even though she was symptom-free. Four days after the operation, Walters&#x27; spokeswoman, Cindi Berger, said that the procedure to fix the faulty heart valve &quot;went well, and the doctors are very pleased with the outcome&quot;. Walters returned to &quot;The View&quot; and her Sirius XM satellite show, &quot;Here&#x27;s Barbara&quot;, in September 2010. Walters retired permanently from both shows four years later.

Walters died at her home in Manhattan, on December 30, 2022, at age 93. She had been suffering from dementia in her later years. Her last words were, &quot;No regrets – I had a great life.&quot; Those words were etched into her gravestone at Lakeside Memorial Park in Doral, Florida.

== Legacy and awards ==
Walters began her career when the prevalent view among television executives (all of whom were male) was that women reporting news about war, politics and other important matters would be taken lightly by viewers. Her success is credited with creating career opportunities for future female network anchors, including Jane Pauley, Katie Couric and Diane Sawyer. Walters often got her interviewees to speak about their perspectives and share anecdotes. She was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 1989. On June 15, 2007, Walters received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She won Daytime and Prime Time Emmy Awards, a Women in Film Lucy Award, and a GLAAD Excellence in Media award.

In 2008, Walters was honored with the Disney Legends award, given to those who made an outstanding contribution to The Walt Disney Company, which owns the network ABC. That same year, she received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the New York Women&#x27;s Agenda. On September 21, 2009, Walters was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 30th Annual News and Documentary Emmy Awards at New York City&#x27;s Lincoln Center.

Walters&#x27; status as a prominent figure in popular culture was reflected by Gilda Radner&#x27;s gentle parody of her as &quot;Baba Wawa&quot; on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in the late 1970s, featuring Walters&#x27; distinctive speech including her rounded &quot;R&#x27;s&quot;. Her name appeared in the January 23, 1995 &quot;New York Times&quot; Monday Crossword Puzzle.

==Bibliography==
In the late 1960s, Walters wrote a magazine article, &quot;How to Talk to Practically Anyone About Practically Anything&quot;, which drew upon the kinds of things people said to her, which were often mistakes. Shortly after the article appeared, she received a letter from Doubleday expressing interest in expanding it into a book. Walters felt that it would help &quot;tongue-tied, socially awkward people—the many people who worry that they can&#x27;t think of the right thing to say to start a conversation.&quot;

Walters published the book &quot;How to Talk with Practically Anybody About Practically Anything&quot; in 1970, with the assistance of ghostwriter June Callwood. To Walters&#x27;s great surprise, the book was a success. As of 2008, it had gone through eight printings, sold hundreds of thousands of copies worldwide, and had been translated into at least six languages.

Walters published her autobiography, &quot;&quot;, in 2008.

<doc id="335070" wikidata="Q14946265" url="?curid=335070" title="President of Bulgaria">
<text>The president of the Republic of Bulgaria (, romanised: &quot;Prezident na Republika Bŭlgariya&quot;) is the head of state of Bulgaria and the commander-in-chief of the Bulgarian Army. The official residence of the president is at Boyana Residence, Sofia. After the completion of the second round of voting, candidate Rumen Radev was elected President of Bulgaria on 13 November 2016.

In Bulgaria, the president&#x27;s role is primarily as a symbolic figure, with the main function being to be the &#x27;arbitrator&#x27; of disputes between Bulgaria&#x27;s different institutions. They are not considered head of government or part of the nation&#x27;s executive power. However, in the absence of a prime minister, presidents are in charge of appointing an interim administration, giving them considerable influence over the government during such periods (Zhelyu Zhelev in 1994-95; Petar Stoyanov in 1997; Rosen Plevneliev in 2013 and 2014; and Rumen Radev in 2017, 2021, and since 2022). On some occasions, the president has appointed the prime minister as well. The president is elected for a five-year term and is restricted to two terms, even if they are non-successive. After an individual has served two terms as president, that individual will forever be barred from being elected to the presidency again under the rules set out by Bulgaria&#x27;s Constitution. The president addresses the nation on national television annually on New Year&#x27;s Eve, just moments before the start of the new year.

== Election ==

=== Eligibility for election ===
For a Bulgarian citizen to be able to run for the office of President of Bulgaria, they must fulfil the following conditions:

*Must be a Bulgarian citizen by birth
*Must be at least 40 years old
*Must have lived in Bulgaria for the five years prior to the candidacy
*Must fulfil all conditions that would be required for election as a representative to Bulgaria&#x27;s National Assembly

=== Electoral system ===
The president is elected directly by the Bulgarian people in a two-round majoritarian election. If a candidate manages to obtain more than 50% of the vote and the voter turnout was at least 50% in the first round, that candidate is elected. If no candidate manages to obtain more than 50% of the vote or the voter turnout was lower than 50% in the first round, then the two top-performing candidates face off in a second round with first-past-the-post voting, with the candidate receiving the larger number of votes considered elected.

== Restrictions ==
The president is banned from also being a member of the National Assembly, as well taking on any other government, public or private offices for the duration of his term. The president is also constitutionally forbidden from being involved in a leadership position of a political party while in office. In practice, despite the fact that most candidates for president are elected from a political party&#x27;s list and despite the fact that the Constitution doesn&#x27;t forbid the president from being an ordinary member of a political party, it is widely expected in Bulgarian society that the president be above politics. For this reason, the president-elect is expected to give up any membership in a political party.

==Powers and privileges==
The president of Bulgaria has a number of functions and powers that are regulated in Chapter 4 of the 1991 Constitution of Bulgaria. The president is elected directly by a popular vote for a period of five years which is renewable.

=== Presidential powers ===
The following powers belong to the president of Bulgaria:

*The ability to give, restore or revoke Bulgarian citizenship, as well as refugee status.
*Appoint and dismiss senior government officials
*Exercise the right to pardon convicted criminals, as well as forgive &#x27;uncollectible&#x27; debts owed to the government
*Rename villages, towns and cities, as well as objects of national importance
*Act as Supreme commander-in-chief of the Bulgarian Armed Forces
*Represent Bulgaria at home and abroad
*Schedule the National and local elections within the intervals designated by law
*Veto any bill coming from the National Assembly by refusing to sign it after its passage in the assembly.
*Declares war, martial law or any other state of emergency (This is done with the assistance of the Consultative Council on National Security)
*Grant and award the orders, decorations, and medals of Bulgaria

=== Immunity ===
The president enjoys blanket legal immunity during his tenure and is not held responsible for any act performed while on duty, with the exception of treason or violation of the Bulgarian constitution. His authority may only be stripped via impeachment and may not be removed by any other institution. The president cannot be detained and may not be prosecuted.

== List of presidents of Bulgaria (1990–present) ==

== Vice president ==

The president is assisted in these duties by the vice president of Bulgaria. The vice president replaces the president in case of absence. Only upon the death, resignation, removal from office or disability of the president, the vice president assumes the presidential powers &amp; duties, until elections are held. The Constitution permits the president to delegate to the vice president the powers to appoint and dismiss certain officials, issue pardons and amnesty, provide citizenship and refugee status, but does not allow the president to delegate any of his other powers., enjoys the same privileges of immunity as the president and can only be dismissed from his office under the same procedures as those regarding the president.

==Termination of office==
According to the constitution, the mandate of the president is completed if and when:

*The presidential term expires 
*The president resigns before the Constitutional Court 
*The president is permanently unable to perform his/her duties due to serious illness
*The president dies while in office
*The president is impeached

=== Impeachment ===
Impeachment can only begin if the president has committed treason or has violated the Constitution of Bulgaria. Impeachment starts after at least a quarter of the members of the National Assembly deposit an accusatory act before the assembly. The act must then be approved by a supermajority of 2/3 of all elected representatives in order to be accepted. If accepted, the case is referred to the Constitutional Court of Bulgaria, which must decide within a one-month time span whether or not the president is guilty of the crime he has been accused of by the Assembly. If the constitutional court finds that the president has committed treason or violated the constitution, as per the accusatory act, then the president is considered successfully impeached and is stripped of his authority.

==Bulgarian presidential line of succession==

*3. Prime Minister of Bulgaria

<doc id="335075" wikidata="Q44690" url="?curid=335075" title="Lincoln Chafee">
<text>Lincoln Davenport Chafee ( ; born March 26, 1953) is an American politician. He was mayor of Warwick, Rhode Island, from 1993 to 1999, a United States Senator from 1999 to 2007, and the 74th Governor of Rhode Island from 2011 to 2015. He was a Democrat from 2013 to 2019; in 2019, he became a Libertarian, having previously been a Republican until September 2007 and an independent and then a Democrat in the interim. He is the last non-Democrat to hold statewide and/or Congressional office in Rhode Island.

The son of Republican politician John Chafee, who was the 66th Governor of Rhode Island, the United States Secretary of the Navy, and a U.S. Senator from Rhode Island, Lincoln Chafee&#x27;s first elected office was as a member of the Warwick City Council in 1985. After John Chafee died in 1999, Lincoln Chafee was appointed to fill his father&#x27;s seat in the U.S. Senate to which he won a full term in 2000.

Chafee was the only Republican in the Senate to vote against authorization of the use of force in Iraq in the lead-up to the Iraq War. He was defeated in his 2006 reelection bid by Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse. Chafee subsequently shifted his affiliation towards the Democratic Party by first endorsing Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election, running as an independent for Governor of Rhode Island in 2010, serving as the co-chair of Obama&#x27;s 2012 re-election campaign, and then finally officially switching his registration to the Democratic Party in May 2013. In March 2019, he switched his political affiliation again to the Libertarian Party.

In 2015, he sought nomination to become the Democratic Party candidate in the 2016 presidential election, but withdrew prior to the primaries. In January 2020, Chafee filed to run again for president, this time seeking the Libertarian nomination. Chafee withdrew his candidacy on April 5, 2020, and announced he would instead focus on helping &quot;other Libertarians seeking office.&quot;

==Early life, education and career==

Lincoln Davenport Chafee was born on March 26, 1953, in Providence, Rhode Island, the son of Virginia (née Coates) and John Chafee. Chafee&#x27;s great-great-grandfather Henry Lippitt was Governor of Rhode Island. Among his great-great-uncles are Rhode Island Governor Charles Warren Lippitt and United States Senator Henry Frederick Lippitt. His great-uncle Zechariah Chafee was a Harvard law professor and a notable civil libertarian. The Chafee family was among the earliest settlers of Hingham, Massachusetts, before moving south to Rhode Island.

He attended public schools in Warwick, Rhode Island, Providence Country Day School, as well as later, Phillips Academy. At Brown University, Chafee captained the wrestling team, and in 1975 earned a Bachelor of Arts in classics. He then attended Montana State University&#x27;s non-degree Farrier School (a sixteen-week horseshoeing program) in Bozeman. For the next seven years, he worked as a farrier at harness racetracks in the United States and Canada. One of the horses he shod, Overburden, set the track record at Northlands Park in Edmonton. In describing how his time as a farrier affected him, Chafee stated that &quot;when you&#x27;re around horses, you tend to be a quieter person.&quot;

==Local politics (1985–1999)==

Chafee entered politics in 1985, when he was elected over eight other candidates to become delegate to the Rhode Island Constitutional Convention. A year later, he was elected to the Warwick City Council, defeating an incumbent, and re-elected in 1988. He ran for Warwick Mayor in 1990, losing by 5 percent in a three-way race.

In 1992, he was elected Warwick&#x27;s first Republican mayor in 32 years, and was re-elected in 1994, 1996, and 1998, when he won by 17% and carried all nine wards.

Chafee was praised for his fair-minded and sensible approach to government, including his ability to work with seven Democrats (of nine seats) on the Warwick City Council. He conservatively managed the city&#x27;s finances, strengthening the city&#x27;s bond rating and paying down the outstanding pension liability.

He worked effectively and cooperatively with the municipal unions, especially in settling a difficult and prolonged teacher labor dispute that he inherited from the previous administration.

As mayor, Chafee made conservation, environmental protection, and wise growth a priority. He purchased 130 acres of open space, planted hundreds of street trees, and created new historic districts and a new economic development &quot;intermodal&quot; district at the state airport. His municipal composting and recycling initiatives dramatically decreased landfill waste. His &quot;Greenwich Bay Initiative&quot;, which extended sewer service to the most environmentally-sensitive areas of the city, earned Warwick recognition by EPA as one of the best local watershed programs in the nation.

==United States Senate (1999–2007)==

===Elections===

====2000====
After his father announced he would not seek re-election in 2000, Lincoln Chafee announced he would run for the seat. When John Chafee died suddenly in October 1999, Governor Lincoln Almond appointed the younger Chafee to serve out the term.

In the general election he faced the Democratic nominee, then-U.S. Representative Robert Weygand. Chafee won the election 57%–41%.

====2006====
In September 2005, Steve Laffey, the mayor of Cranston, Rhode Island, announced his intention to run against Chafee in the Republican primary election. Among other stances differing from those of Chafee, Mayor Laffey opposed abortion and stem cell research. Laffey was supported by notable conservative groups, including the Club for Growth and several anti-abortion groups. Chafee went on to defeat Laffey in the primary on September 12 by a margin of 53%–47%. The turnout for the Republican primary was the largest in Rhode Island history. In his victory speech, Chafee credited independent voters and disaffiliated Democrats for his victory.

Chafee lost to Whitehouse in the general election, 54%–46%. In response to a question at a news conference on November 9, 2006, Chafee stated he was unsure whether he would remain in the Republican Party after serving out the remainder of his term. According to Michelle R. Smith of the Associated Press, when asked whether he felt that his loss may have helped the country by switching control of power in Congress (away from Republicans and toward the Democrats), he replied: &quot;To be honest, yes.&quot;

===Tenure===
Descended from a long line of moderate, center-right New England Republicans, Chafee&#x27;s stances became increasingly liberal, more so than his father&#x27;s positions had been. The now dominant conservatives referred to him as a &quot;Republican In Name Only&quot;, or RINO. Most notable among these was &quot;Human Events&quot; magazine, which named Chafee &quot;the No. 1 RINO in the country.&quot; In 2006, the &quot;National Journal&quot; rated Chafee as the most liberal Republican in the Senate, and placed him to the left of two Democrats, Nebraska&#x27;s Ben Nelson and Louisiana&#x27;s Mary Landrieu. GovTrack also ranked Senator Chafee as the most liberal Republican member in 2006; according to GovTrack&#x27;s analysis, Chafee was to the left of his Republican colleagues as well as to the left of fourteen Democrats.

Known for often disagreeing with the Republican Party leadership, Chafee says he did not cast his ballot for President George W. Bush in the 2004 election, instead choosing to write in former president George H. W. Bush as a nod to the Republican Party of his father. Chafee frequently criticized the younger Bush&#x27;s record on the environment, and expressed concern about the 2004 Republican platform and overall philosophical direction of the party. He described the younger Bush&#x27;s presidency as &quot;an agenda of energizing the far-right-wing base, which is divisive.&quot; Soon thereafter, he rejected Democratic overtures to leave the Republican Party after appeals to him from other Republican senators to remain in their caucus. Chafee considered challenging George W. Bush for re-nomination in the New Hampshire primary in 2004 on an anti- (Iraq and Afghanistan) war platform. In his autobiography, &quot;Against the Tide&quot; (2007), he states that &quot;In the fall of 2003, part of me thought it was cowardly to oppose the president on so many issues and then not oppose him head-on as he sought renomination.&quot; However, he decided not to run after the capture of Saddam Hussein on December 13, 2003.

====Fiscal policy====
Chafee also voted against both the 2001 and 2003 congressional budget bills that cut and/or rebated individuals&#x27; federal income taxes. He asserted that tax cuts reduce revenue to the federal government, thereby worsening the federal budget deficit and increasing the amount of money it has to borrow in order to operate. In 2004, Chafee broke with his party again to oppose the acceleration of the Bush tax cuts. &quot;Four Senate moderates -- John McCain of Arizona, Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins, both of Maine, and Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island -- had insisted on attaching a provision that would have applied pay-as-you-go-rules for the next five years.&quot;

On November 17, 2005, he voted in favor of reinstating the top federal income tax rate of 39.6% (which last existed under President Bill Clinton in the 1990s) on the highest-income taxpayers.

In 2003, Chafee voted against the Medicare Part D prescription drug expansion. However, Chafee also cast a crucial procedural vote against a Democratic attempt to kill that bill, which failed by only two votes. Chafee also co-sponsored the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, which expanded federal jurisdiction over class-action lawsuits, and voted against a wholesale ban on gifts from employees of lobbying companies.

The Cato Institute&#x27;s Center for Trade Policy Studies identified Chafee as a &quot;free trader&quot; during his U.S. Senate tenure, indicating a pro-free trade, pro-market, and anti-subsidies voting record. Chafee has supported free trade agreements (e.g., North American Free Trade Agreement and Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) and bankruptcy reform.

As U.S. Senator from Rhode Island, Chafee received grades of D in 2000, C− in 2001, C in 2002, C− in 2003 and 2004, and D in 2005 and 2006 from the National Taxpayers Union, a conservative taxpayers advocacy organization.

====Environment====

Chafee was one of the few Republicans to vote against allowing drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and was a member of the Republicans for Environmental Protection. He has been endorsed throughout his career by the Sierra Club and the League of Conservative Voters as a strong leader for environmental causes, despite criticisms from other progressive activist groups decrying the endorsement of a (then) Republican.

Chafee sponsored the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2002, enabling the clean up and redevelopment of thousands of abandoned urban buildings throughout the United States.

====Social policy====
Chafee was a member of the Republican Majority for Choice and Republicans for Choice. Chafee was also a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership.

Chafee is pro-choice. In 2003, Chafee was one of the three Republican Senators to oppose the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. His 2006 senatorial re-election bid was endorsed by NARAL Pro-Choice America. He also supported federal funding for embryonic stem cell research.

In 2004, Chafee was one of six Republicans to vote against the Federal Marriage Amendment, an amendment intended to ban gay marriage; in 2006, he voted against banning gay marriage a second time. During his tenure, Chafee was the only sitting or former Republican senator to support the legalization of same-sex marriage, until Rob Portman of Ohio endorsed it in 2013.

He supported affirmative action and gun control, and was one of only two Republicans to vote against the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (which prevents firearms manufacturers and dealers from being held liable for crimes committed with their products). On June 27, 2006, Chafee was one of only three Republicans to vote against the proposed Flag Desecration Amendment.

Chafee opposes the death penalty, and has consistently voted against limiting death penalty appeals in federal cases. He has also favored including racial statistics in death penalty appeals, and making DNA analysis a prerequisite for any federal-level, criminal executions.

On May 23, 2005, Chafee was one of 14 bipartisan senators to forge a compromise on the Democrats&#x27; use of the judicial filibuster, forestalling the Republican leadership&#x27;s implementation of the so-called &quot;nuclear option&quot;. Under the agreement, the Democrats would retain the power to filibuster a Bush II judicial nominee only in an &quot;extraordinary circumstance&quot;, and three of the most conservative Bush appellate court nominees (Janice Rogers Brown, Priscilla Owen and William Pryor) would receive a vote by the full Senate. Chafee was the only Republican to oppose George W. Bush&#x27;s nomination of Samuel Alito to the United States Supreme Court. However, he voted to end debate on the nomination, helping to end any chance of a Democratic filibuster of it. Chafee did not announce his opposition to the nomination until a majority of Senators had already publicly said they would support Alito.

====Foreign policy====
Chafee was the only Republican in the Senate to vote against authorization of the use of force in Iraq in the lead-up to the Iraq War. On June 22, 2006, he was the only Republican to vote for the Levin amendment calling for a nonbinding timetable for a withdrawal of US troops from Iraq. Chafee voted against the Kerry-Feingold amendment calling for a binding timetable.

Chafee is now involved in J Street, a liberal Jewish group that calls for Israel to withdraw from all occupied territories and advocates for a &quot;two state&quot; solution to the Arab–Israeli conflict.

In November 2006, immediately following the midterm elections, Chafee joined key Democrats in opposing President Bush&#x27;s renomination of John Bolton as United States Ambassador to the United Nations. On December 4, 2006, the White House announced that Bolton would no longer seek the appointment, and would resign within a matter of weeks.

====Committee assignments====
* U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations
* U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works
* U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs

==Political hiatus (2007–2009)==

In December 2006, Chafee announced he was accepting a fellowship to serve as a &quot;distinguished visiting fellow&quot; at Brown University&#x27;s Thomas J. Watson Jr. Institute for International Studies. The university had Chafee lead a student group studying U.S. foreign policy.

In September 2007, Chafee officially left the Republican Party, changing his affiliation to Independent. He said that he did so because of the Republican Party&#x27;s drifting away from its core values, such as its abandoning fiscal conservatism. Citing the party&#x27;s new tendency to pass tax cuts without spending cuts to balance the loss of revenue, he noted how the party was destroying social programs aimed to help middle-class and lower-income Americans, particularly Pell Grants and Head Start. In February 2008, he said he was considering voting for then-Senator Barack Obama in Rhode Island&#x27;s Democratic presidential primary election. On February 14, 2008, with the Rhode Island Democratic primary approaching in three weeks, Chafee officially endorsed Obama. In 2012, he was one of 35 co-chairs selected to &quot;act as key surrogates and ambassadors&quot; for Obama&#x27;s re-election campaign.

In 2008, Chafee joined the advisory board of J Street, a lobbying group that promotes diplomatic relations between Israel and its neighbors, and supports an independent Palestinian state.

In September 2008, Chafee received media attention for describing Sarah Palin, then-Governor of Alaska and the Republican vice-presidential nominee in the 2008 presidential election, as a &quot;cocky wacko.&quot;

==Governor of Rhode Island (2011–2015)==

===2010 election===

On January 4, 2010, Chafee formally declared his intention to run for Governor of Rhode Island in 2010 as an independent, as the incumbent Governor Donald Carcieri (a Republican re-elected the same day Chafee lost his Senate re-election bid) was term-limited at the time. On October 31, 2010, electoral analysis site FiveThirtyEight.com gave Chafee a 63.8% chance of victory, compared to Democratic opponent Frank T. Caprio&#x27;s 26.2% and Republican opponent John Robitaille&#x27;s 10.0%. Likewise, other sites, such as the Cook Political Report, classified the race as a &quot;toss-up&quot;. Chafee&#x27;s approval rating at the time of his 2006 defeat was between 51% and 63%.

On September 16, 2010, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg (who had also switched from Republican to Independent to Democratic in recent years) traveled to Rhode Island. Bloomberg praised Chafee&#x27;s &quot;experience and integrity&quot;, saying that Chafee would put Rhode Islanders&#x27; interests &quot;ahead of party interests&quot;, and that Chafee would &quot;produce results -— because that&#x27;s exactly what he did as a mayor and as senator.&quot;

It was reported that President Obama&#x27;s lack of endorsement of any of the candidates indicated tacit support of Chafee over Democrat Caprio.

Chafee easily won the endorsements of all major public school teachers unions, including the Rhode Island affiliates of the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers in his 2010 gubernatorial campaign.

On November 2, 2010, Chafee won the gubernatorial race, winning with a 36% plurality in the seven-candidate race.

===Switch to the Democratic Party===
In August 2012, he announced plans to attend the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, to show support for President Barack Obama&#x27;s re-election campaign. After constant speculation during his term, Chafee officially joined the Democratic Party on May 30, 2013. He had previously indicated that he might run for re-election as an Independent or a Democrat.

===Recession===
Chafee came to office in the depths of the worst recession in decades. Unemployment peaked at 11.4% in the first months of his tenure. Over his four budgets, July 1, 2011, to June 30, 2015, the rate dropped to 5.9%, second best in the country.

Chafee also inherited a crisis with impending bankruptcies of a number of municipalities including Providence, East Providence, Pawtucket, West Warwick and Woonsocket.

As a former mayor, Chafee was a strong advocate for the state&#x27;s city and towns. He increased state aid and intervened to protect these distressed communities.

One city, Central Falls, did declare a bankruptcy. Chafee appointed a special master to run the city on an interim basis, negotiate concessions with labor and retirees, and pass a budget with tax increases. Central Falls emerged from bankruptcy the following year.

===Fiscal issues===
Chafee had campaigned on a platform that included lowering the state sales tax by creating a 1% tax on 59 tax exempt commodities and services. This would have squarely addressed the Rhode Island legislature annual budget deficit.

A 2012 poll showed that some of Chafee&#x27;s proposed tax increases, intended to move the state from budget deficit to surplus status, had received negative feedback from Rhode Island residents. As Governor of Rhode Island, Chafee received grades of D in 2012 and B in 2014 from the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, in their biennial Fiscal Policy Report Card on America&#x27;s Governors.

In two of his four budgets, there were no tax increases. At the same time, he restored 20% to local education and higher education, cut by his predecessor.

===Social issues===
In May 2012, Chafee refused on principle to release a prisoner charged with murder to federal custody because Rhode Island hadn&#x27;t had an execution since 1842 and the US Attorney refused to guarantee the prisoner, if convicted would receive a maximum life imprisonment without parole. Chafee said: &quot;The State of Rhode Island must seek to protect both the strong states&#x27; rights issues at stake, and the legitimacy of its longstanding public policy against the death penalty.&quot;

Chafee championed a bill that legalized same-sex marriage in Rhode Island, signing it into law on May 2, 2013.

Chafee has shown some willingness to deviate from strict &quot;War on Drugs&quot; policies, in favor of alternative approaches to America&#x27;s drug-crime problem.

===Education===
On &quot;education reform&quot; in general, Chafee does not believe the politically and publicly popular presumption that America&#x27;s schools are failing, saying:

This notion of all these failing schools, if this were true, how did America get to be at the status where we are in the world if it were that bad? So I don&#x27;t buy into the trashing of our public school system. Somehow Brown University, and University of Rhode Island and Bryant University, Providence College are full of public school students that are doing very, very well and leading America in many fields. Yes, there&#x27;s room for improvement, I don&#x27;t deny that and I want to be part of the improvement. But the notion that our public school systems are in disarray and failing, I don&#x27;t buy that.

===38 Studios===
Chafee was the only public figure in Rhode Island to vigorously oppose an ill-fated deal in which the previous governor committed an unsecured $75 million loan to a former baseball star, Curt Schilling, to develop a new video game, &quot;Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning&quot;. The first payments started two months before he took office in January 2011.

The game was released in February 2012 to moderate critical success, but failed commercially. 38 Studios ended up laying off their staff and filed for bankruptcy. According to Schilling, Chafee&#x27;s public comments calling the game a &quot;failure&quot; caused a publisher to pull out of a $35 million deal that could have paid for a sequel. In response, Chafee said he would need to &quot;verify&quot; Schilling&#x27;s claim, saying that he couldn&#x27;t &quot;just take it as a leap of faith.&quot; He added that it &quot;isn&#x27;t accurate&quot; to blame the state for the company&#x27;s collapse.

As chair of the agency securing the loan, Chafee initiated a lawsuit to recover lost funds for Rhode Island taxpayers. To date, about $17 million has been recovered through settlements.

===Christmas tree controversy===

In 2011, Fox News and local conservatives and pundits stirred up controversy over the Christmas tree at the Rhode Island State House. Governor Chafee said he called the towering fir, decorated with lights, tinsel and toys, a &quot;holiday tree,&quot; because that had been the accepted practice of the two previous governors, both Republicans. Chafee went on national TV with commentator Bill O&#x27;Reilly, calling Fox News&#x27; &quot;war on Christmas&quot; coverage &quot;angry.&quot;

===2014 election===

Chafee had previously indicated that he might run for re-election as an Independent or a Democrat. With polling showing him trailing in the Democratic primary, Chafee announced on September 4, 2013, that he would not run for re-election. Chafee thus became just the fourth governor in the history of Rhode Island to decline to seek a second term, and the first since William S. Flynn in 1924.

==2016 presidential campaign==

On April 9, 2015, Chafee announced that he had formed an exploratory committee in preparation for a potential candidacy for President of the United States as a Democrat in 2016. He formally declared candidacy on June 3, 2015, with the campaign focused on ten stated issues with &quot;Prosperity Through Peace&quot; being his slogan.

Following a widely panned debate performance and poor polling numbers, Chafee announced on October 23, 2015, that he would be ending his campaign. After she secured the Democratic nomination, a Chafee spokesman said that he would support Hillary Clinton.

==Subsequent activities==
Chafee considered challenging Sheldon Whitehouse for his former Senate seat in 2018, but ultimately decided against doing so.

Between 2018 and 2019, Chafee and his family moved their residency to Wyoming. By 2018, Chaffee&#x27;s wife Stefanie had registered as a voter in Teton Village, Wyoming. Chafee completed his move to Wyoming in 2019.

In 2020, Chafee joined the Libertarians for the National Popular Vote advisory board.

Chafee has endorsed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the 2024 United States presidential election. Kennedy initially ran as a Democrat and later withdrew before the Democratic primaries began to run as an Independent.

==2020 presidential campaign==
In February 2017, Chafee had made it known that he was not ruling out another run for the presidency.

On March 11, 2019, Chafee officially switched from the Democratic to the Libertarian Party, stating, &quot;It&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve always been—fiscally conservative and socially liberal.&quot; In August, Chafee declared that he&#x27;d &quot;be open&quot; to running for president as a Libertarian.

On January 5, 2020, Chafee formally filed to run for the Libertarian Party nomination. He formally announced his candidacy on January 8 at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.

Chafee&#x27;s 2020 platform highlighted issues such as foreign intervention, the war on drugs, and government spending. While individuals such as former New York gubernatorial candidate Larry Sharpe and national party chair Nicholas Sarwark were supportive of Chafee, others including the Rhode Island state chair Pat Ford were more skeptical due to his historical positions on gun control issues, among other things. According to &quot;The Providence Journal&quot;, Chafee hired Libertarian consultant Christopher Thrasher as campaign manager and selected Westerly Town Council member Caswell Cooke Jr. for the position of campaign treasurer.

On April 5, 2020, Chafee announced on Facebook that he was ending his campaign for the Libertarian presidential nomination. He did not make any endorsements for president.

==Political positions==
While serving in the U.S. Senate, Chafee was characterized as a &quot;moderate&quot; or even &quot;liberal Republican.&quot; The non-partisan &quot;National Journal&quot; in 2005 gave him a composite 59% liberal score and a 41% conservative score. His record as a more liberal Republican Senator earned him criticism from conservatives; the conservative magazine, &quot;Human Events&quot;, labeled him one of the top ten RINOs, or what they consider to be insufficiently conservative, in 2005. According to GovTrack, Chafee was the most liberal Republican Senator in 2006 being placed by GovTrack&#x27;s analysis to the left of every Republican and several Democrats. Later, as governor of Rhode Island, he pursued a centrist agenda that alienated special interests on both the left and right, &quot;from unions to the state&#x27;s Roman Catholic bishop.&quot; He has called for moderation and deescalation in U.S. foreign policy, combined with pragmatic fiscal conservatism, and liberal social policies.

=== Domestic policy ===

==== Abortion ====
Chafee has generally been considered pro-choice. In the U.S. Senate, Chafee was one of three Republicans to vote against the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. He has received a 90-percent rating from NARAL and previously served on that organization&#x27;s national board. In 2015 Chafee said that he strongly supported &quot;a woman&#x27;s right to make her own personal reproductive decisions.&quot;

Chafee is the only governor to have vetoed a bill proposing the availability of Choose Life license plates to Rhode Islanders, citing an inappropriateness of using state license plates to fund politically divisive initiatives and as a violation of the separation of Church and State. This decision was criticized as a violation of free speech and as having been influenced by his previous post on NARAL&#x27;s board of directors.

==== Crime and civil rights ====
Chafee&#x27;s policy on firearms regulation previously mirrored the views of his father, John Chafee, who was generally supportive of a strict regulatory environment. Chafee later said he supports &quot;common sense adherence to the Second Amendment.&quot; In January 2020, in an interview with &quot;Reason&quot; magazine, he cited “distrust in government” as the reason his position had evolved, and that he “believe[s] the authors of the Second Amendment wrote it with that in mind.” 

In 2011, as governor of Rhode Island, Chafee challenged an order of a federal court to transfer a prisoner in state custody to the United States government, because the prisoner in question might be subject to capital punishment, which Rhode Island had abolished. At the time, Chafee said, &quot;my actions are motivated by my obligation as governor to safeguard Rhode Island&#x27;s sovereignty and the integrity of its laws.&quot;

Chafee has indicated he is receptive to the idea of legalizing the recreational use of marijuana and in 2006 supported Rhode Island&#x27;s legalization of medical marijuana. He has praised the Libertarian Party for its “enlightened approach to the corrosive and failed war on drugs.”
In March 2020, after moving to Wyoming, Chafee testified in favour of a bill in the Wyoming House of Representatives that would have legalized and regulated marijuana usage in Wyoming.

In 2015 Chafee said he believed &quot;certain of our rights have been wrongfully infringed upon. Particularly the Fourth Amendment which forbids the tapping of our phones without a warrant.&quot; While in the U.S. Senate, Chafee was the only Republican to vote against the Military Commissions Act of 2006, which restricted habeas corpus rights of persons detained by the U.S. Department of Defense as enemy combatants.

==== Elections ====
Chafee has said he supports requiring voters to present photo identification at polling places. In 2011 he signed legislation mandating photo ID in Rhode Island elections, stating that he believed requiring photo ID was a &quot;reasonable request to ensure the accuracy and integrity of our elections.&quot; The Rhode Island law does allow voters without an approved form of identification to cast a provisional ballot that will be counted if the voter&#x27;s signature matches the one on file.

In 2013, five years after his &quot;Providence Journal&quot; commentary urging passage of the plan, Chafee signed legislation entering Rhode Island into the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. As governor he also signed legislation creating the Voter Choice Study Commission &quot;for the purpose of studying instant-runoff voting and other advanced voting methods.&quot;

In the Senate, Chafee voted in support of the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (commonly known as the McCain-Feingold Act), which tightened regulation of &quot;soft money&quot; contributions in political campaigns.

==== Environment ====
Chafee has stated his opposition to oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. In the Senate he opposed the Clear Skies Act of 2003 which critics said would increase air pollution if enacted. Chafee has argued that granite is objectively the best rock as it is vital to Rhode Island&#x27;s economy. The League of Conservation Voters has given Chafee a 79-percent rating while, in 2006, he received an endorsement from the Sierra Club.

==== Metric system ====
Chafee supports switching the U.S. to the metric system.

==== Same-sex marriage ====
Chafee opposes a constitutional amendment intended to ban gay marriage. In 2011, Governor Chafee signed a bill into law legalizing civil unions. In 2013, as governor of Rhode Island, Chafee signed legislation legalizing same-sex marriage in that state, declaring that &quot;we are living up to the ideal of our founders&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Chafee as a &quot;strong proponent&quot; of the bill, which faced significant opposition from the Democratic president of the Rhode Island State Senate.

==== Taxes ====
As Rhode Island governor, Chafee called for a cut in the commercial property tax to spur economic development in Providence, Rhode Island. From the National Taxpayers Union, a conservative taxpayers advocacy organization, as U.S. Senator from Rhode Island, Chafee received grades of D in 2000, C− in 2001, C in 2002, C− in 2003 and 2004, D in 2005 and 2006, and as Governor of Rhode Island, Chafee received a &quot;B&quot; rating, the National Taxpayers Union citing his move to repeal the Rhode Island franchise tax and reduce estate taxes. Also as Governor of Rhode Island, Chafee received grades of D in 2012 and B in 2014 from the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, in their biennial Fiscal Policy Report Card on America&#x27;s Governors.

In 2001 and 2003, while in the U.S. Senate, Chafee voted against the Bush tax cuts arguing he was concerned they favored the highest income brackets and about unchecked growth in the federal deficit. Chafee said that &quot;cutting taxes is easy for politicians, we love to cut taxes. It takes responsibility to make sure our revenues match our expenditures and we&#x27;re not doing that right now.&quot;

=== Foreign policy ===

==== Iran ====
Chafee supports President Obama&#x27;s nuclear disarmament agreement with Iran. He has called for deescalation combined with cultural dialogue and exchange modeled after &quot;the ping pong diplomacy of the Nixon era.&quot; He is strongly opposed to a possible war with Iran, which he sees as a negative consequence stemming from the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which he also opposed.

==== Israel ====
Chafee has criticized what he has characterized as a Biblical influence on U.S. policy with respect to Israel. He has said he opposes the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, but described Hamas as a &quot;violent organization with a genocidal charter&quot; In 2007, Chafee also stated that Israel&#x27;s security was a paramount consideration in resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict. Chafee serves on the advisory council of J Street and has voted to continue foreign aid to the Israeli government, among others.
==== Latin America ====
Referring to Latin America, Chafee has called for the U.S. government to &quot;reengage our neighbors.&quot; However, Chafee has also said recent U.S. inattention to the region was &quot;a blessing in disguise&quot; as it allowed democratic governments to flourish free of U.S. influence.

==== Russia ====
Chafee has said one of the U.S.&#x27; highest priorities should be improving relations with the Russian Federation and has called for rapprochement, including the lifting of sanctions against Russia.

==== War ====
While serving in the United States Senate, Chafee was one of 23 senators, and the only Republican, to vote against the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq, which provided the legal mechanism for the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. When asked, in 2015, how the U.S. could most effectively deal with ISIS, Chafee said the U.S. should pursue a policy of containment through alliance-building with regional powers. Chafee has said the U.S. &quot;must make international decisions with brains and not biceps&quot;, and at the first 2016 Democratic primary debate, stated that the U.S. must end its use of &quot;perpetual wars&quot;, referring in part to the War on Terror. In his speech declaring his withdrawal from the 2016 Presidential race at the annual Women&#x27;s Leadership Forum in Washington, DC, Chafee again made the case for peace, attacking the field of Republican candidates for demonstrating a lack of desire &quot;to understand anything about the Middle East and North Africa&quot; and instead espousing &quot;more bellicosity, more saber rattling, and more blind macho posturing.&quot; He ended the speech by reminding the audience that the United States is one of the strongest countries in history, economically, militarily, and culturally, and so not only could afford to take risks for peace, but &quot;must take risks for peace.&quot; Arguing for a new paradigm, he concluded by asking the audience whether they wanted to be remembered as bombers of weddings and hospitals, or as peace makers. He has cited its anti-war stance as one of the primary reasons he joined the Libertarian Party, calling it “the party of peace” in a &quot;Boston Globe&quot; op-ed.

=== Endorsements ===
Chafee endorsed George W. Bush in the 2000 U.S. presidential election, but declined to endorse Bush in the 2004 contest. In 2008 Chafee endorsed Barack Obama for U.S. president during the Democratic Party presidential primaries, and went on to serve as national co-chair of Obama&#x27;s 2012 reelection campaign. During the 2014 election for governor of Rhode Island, which Chafee did not contest, he endorsed Clay Pell in the Democratic primary.

==Personal life==
Chafee and his wife, Stephanie Birney (Danforth) Chafee, married in January 1990. They have three children: Louisa, Caleb, and Thea. Louisa qualified for the 2016 Summer Olympics in sailing. He is a member of The Episcopal Church. , he lives in Teton Village, Wyoming.

<doc id="335077" wikidata="Q380570" url="?curid=335077" title="Jon Corzine">
<text>Jon Stevens Corzine ( ; born January 1, 1947) is an American financial executive and retired politician who served as a United States Senator from New Jersey from 2001 to 2006, and the 54th governor of New Jersey from 2006 to 2010. Corzine ran for a second term as governor but lost to Republican Chris Christie. A member of the Democratic Party, he previously worked at Goldman Sachs; after leaving politics, he was CEO of MF Global from 2010 until its collapse in 2011.

==Education and early business career==
Corzine was born in Taylorville, Illinois, the son of Nancy June (née Hedrick) and Roy Allen Corzine, Jr. His grandfather Roy A. Corzine, Sr. served in the Illinois General Assembly. He grew up on a small family farm in Willey Station, Illinois near Taylorville. After completing high school at Taylorville High School, where he had been the football quarterback and basketball captain, he attended the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, where he was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity, and graduated in 1969, earning Phi Beta Kappa honors. While in college, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps Reserve and served from 1969 until 1975, attaining the rank of sergeant. In 1970, he enrolled in the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, from which he received a Master of Business Administration degree in 1973.

His first business experience was in the bond department of Continental Illinois National Bank, where he worked days while attending the Booth School of Business MBA program at night. He then moved to BancOhio National Bank, a regional bank in Columbus, Ohio, that was acquired in 1984 by National City Bank. Corzine worked at BancOhio until 1975, when he moved his family to New Jersey and was hired as a bond trader for Goldman Sachs.

==Goldman Sachs==
In 1976, Corzine joined Goldman Sachs as a bond trader and then became co-manager of the Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities Division. He became a partner in 1980, and a member of the management committee in 1984. He served as Goldman Sachs&#x27; CFO (1991–1994), and a senior partner (1994–1999). During his leadership, Corzine oversaw the firm&#x27;s expansion into Asia and was instrumental in leading the transition of the firm from a private partnership to a public company.

Corzine also chaired a presidential commission on capital budgeting for Bill Clinton and served as Chairman of the United States Department of the Treasury&#x27;s borrowing committee. As the Goldman Sachs senior partner, he helped develop a private sector plan to rescue the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management when the leveraged fund&#x27;s collapse in the fall of 1998 threatened contagion across the U.S. financial system. According to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, Corzine did not get along with co-CEO Henry Paulson, who came from the other major area of the bank, investment banking. When Corzine participated in structuring the bailout, Paulson seized control of the firm. When Goldman Sachs went public after Corzine&#x27;s departure, Corzine made $400 million.

Corzine has participated in meetings of the Bilderberg Group, a network of leaders in the fields of politics, business and banking (1995–1997, 1999, 2003, and 2004). He is a former member of the group&#x27;s steering committee.

Corzine is a member of Kappa Beta Phi.

==U.S. Senate==

===2000 election===

After being forced out from Goldman Sachs in January 1999, Corzine campaigned for a New Jersey Senate seat after Frank Lautenberg announced his retirement. Despite initially trailing behind his opponent in the Democratic primary by 30 percentage points, Corzine won the nomination by 16 points. He later attributed his successful primary run to pollster Bob Shrum who convinced him to run not as &quot;a seasoned investment banker and job creator&quot; but as a &quot;liberal progressive&quot;. In the general election, Corzine won by just a three-point margin over his Republican opponent, four-term United States Congressman Bob Franks, in the November 2000 election. He was sworn into the Senate in January 2001.

He spent more than $62 million of his own money on his campaign, the most expensive Senate campaign in U.S. historyover $33 million of this was spent on the primary election alone, where he defeated former Governor James Florio 58–42%. Franks had been a last-minute choice because New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman had been expected to run for the Senate. The record $62 million amount surpassed Michael Huffington, who spent nearly $28 million in an unsuccessful 1994 Senate race.

During the campaign, Corzine refused to release his income tax return records. He claimed an interest in doing so, but he cited a confidentiality agreement with Goldman Sachs. Skeptics argued that Corzine should have followed the example of his predecessor Robert Rubin, who converted his equity stake into debt upon leaving Goldman.

Corzine campaigned for state government programs including universal health care, universal gun registration, mandatory public preschool, and more taxpayer funding for college education. He pushed affirmative action and same-sex marriage. David Brooks opined that Corzine was so liberal that his election, although the fact that his predecessor was also a Democrat, helped push the Senate to the left.

During Corzine&#x27;s campaign for the United States Senate, he made some controversial off-color statements. When introduced to a man with an Italian name who said he was in the construction business, Corzine quipped: &quot;Oh, you make cement shoes!&quot; according to Emanuel Alfano, chairman of the Italian-American One Voice Committee. Alfano reported that when introduced to a lawyer named David Stein, Corzine said: &quot;He&#x27;s not Italian, is he? Oh, I guess he&#x27;s your Jewish lawyer who is here to get the rest of you out of jail.&quot; Corzine denied mentioning religion, but did not deny the quip about Italians, stating that some of his own ancestors were probably Italian, or maybe French.

Also in 2000, Corzine denied having made payments to African-American ministers, although the foundation controlled by Jon and Joanne Corzine had paid one influential black church $25,000. Reginald T. Jackson, director of the Black Ministers Council of New Jersey, had campaigned against a form of racial profiling whereby police officers stop minority drivers, and had gotten New Jersey state police superintendent Carl A. Williams fired. Corzine had donated to Jackson prior to getting what appears to be a reciprocal endorsement.

===Tenure===

Corzine entered Congress in a class of 10 new senators, eight of whom were Democrats. According to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, Corzine, Hillary Clinton and Jean Carnahan were the more notable new senators in 2000. During his five-year senatorial career, he was present at 1,503 of 1,673 votes, cosponsored 1,014 bills, sponsored 145 bills (only 11 of which made it out of committee), and had one sponsored bill enacted.

He co-authored the Sarbanes–Oxley Act. In the aftermath of Enron, he cosponsored (with Barbara Boxer) legislation, which was later propounded by Ted Kennedy, that reforms the 401(k) plan to minimize the risk of investment portfolios. The plan was opposed by President George W. Bush and faced strong opposition in Congress. Restrictions on retirement account allocations were in direct opposition to the contemporaneous movement towards self-directed individual retirement accounts for Social Security.

Corzine was a sponsor of the Start Healthy, Stay Healthy Act. He supported providing a two-year tax break to victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks and help grant citizenship to victims who were legal resident aliens. He supported gun control laws, outlawing racial profiling, and subsidies for Amtrak. He was the chief sponsor, along with U.S. Senator Sam Brownback, of the Darfur Accountability Act. He was one of 23 Senators to vote against the Iraq War Resolution. Corzine was the prime sponsor, along with fellow New Jersey U.S. Senator Frank Lautenberg, of a federal version of John&#x27;s Law, in memory of Navy Ensign John R. Elliott (a native of New Jersey), a U.S. Naval Academy graduate who was killed by a drunk driver. The legislation provides federal highway safety grant incentives to encourage states to impound the cars of DUI suspects. He was an early contributing blogger at &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;.

In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks, Corzine and Peter Fitzgerald attempted to mold a more disciplined bailout of the airline industry, but even the redesigned plan was not entirely satisfactory to Corzine. Corzine opposed the reduction in low-income student eligibility for Pell Grant funding caused by changes in the &quot;expected family contribution&quot;.

Corzine tried and failed to introduce legislation for chemical plant regulation six weeks after the September 11, 2001 attacks. Subsequent efforts by then-Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and former New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman in 2002 were also squelched. Along with Hillary Clinton, he was one of the few senators who attempted to pressure the Bush administration to clamp down on regulation of the chemical and nuclear-power industries. His efforts helped make New Jersey one of the stricter states in the nation in terms of chemical plant regulation.

In 2001, Corzine coauthored (with Bob Graham) a tax-cut proposal aimed at lowering the marginal tax bracket from 15% to 10% on the first $19,000 of taxable income. In 2002, he proposed a tax cut that exempted the first $10,000 of income from the $765 of Social Security taxes for both employers and employees. Corzine also proposed making dividend payments tax deductible to companies as a form of economic stimulus.

While in the Senate, he chaired the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee from 2003 to 2005. In this role he was influential in convincing certain potential candidates to not run in order to avoid costly primaries in three key states during the 2004 United States Senate elections. He also played a role in the selection of Senator John Edwards as a running mate for Senator John Kerry. In 2002, Corzine called for the resignation of United States Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt.

===Committee assignments===
In the Senate, Corzine was a member of the Committees on Banking, Intelligence, the Budget, Foreign Relations, Environment, and Energy and Natural Resources.

==Campaigns for New Jersey Governor==
===2005===
Corzine and his opponent, Republican Doug Forrester, spent $73 million on their gubernatorial campaigns by the week before election day. This included $38 million by Corzine and $19 million by Forrester for the general election. The primaries accounted for the difference. Since Corzine had spent over $62 million on his 2000 United States Senate elections, the combined expenditures for Corzine&#x27;s run for the Senate and governorship exceeded $100 million. The main campaign issues were property taxes and the Bush administration. New Jersey had averaged $5,500 in 2004 property taxes, and Corzine tried to link his opponent to Bush.

The campaign for the post of Governor of New Jersey was successful with 54% of the vote. Forrester, a businessman and a former Mayor of West Windsor Township, in Mercer County, won 43%. Corzine received 1,224,493 votes to Forrester&#x27;s 985,235. A total of 80,277 votes, or 3%, were scattered among other candidates. Corzine won 13 of New Jersey&#x27;s 21 counties: Atlantic, Bergen, Burlington, Camden, Cumberland, Essex, Gloucester, Hudson, Mercer, Middlesex, Passaic, Salem, and Union. Corzine won the three most populous counties (Bergen, Essex, and Middlesex), five of the top six, and seven of the top nine.

===2009===
Corzine ran for re-election in the 2009 New Jersey gubernatorial election. In January 2009, Rasmussen Reports indicated that recently announced Republican challenger Chris Christie led Corzine 42% to 40%. Other polls that month showed Corzine with approvals of 46% to 40%, but these were trailing his &quot;favorables&quot;, which were just 42–44%. By June and July, a number of polls showed Corzine trailing the Republican nominee, Christie, by double digits, though the tide changed again and by October polls showed Corzine was close, and in some cases, ahead. In the end, Corzine lost the race to Christie by a margin of 48.5% to 44.9%, with 5.8% of the vote going to independent candidate Chris Daggett.

==Governor of New Jersey==

Corzine officially declined his $175,000 salary in 2006.

After taking office in January 2006, Corzine&#x27;s approval numbers were very low. Many polls seemed to indicate that much of this negative polling was a result of the protracted budget battle ahead of the 2006 New Jersey State Government shutdown in July. An April 26, 2006, poll from Quinnipiac University Polling Institute showed Corzine at a 35% approval with a 42% disapproval. A February 28, 2007, poll from Quinnipiac University showed Corzine at 50% approval with 34% disapproval. When Corzine released a controversial plan to monetize the New Jersey Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway, his approval rating fell to 30% in January 2008. 

In conjunction with this fall in approval rating, an initiative to recall the Governor was started for the first and only time ever in New Jersey history. The recall effort failed after gathering less than the required 1.2 million signatures.

Corzine had long insisted that state employees must bear part of the cost of their health benefits after retirement. As of July 1, 2007, in agreements with the Communications Workers of America, the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, and the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, active State employees in those unions (as well as certain other non-union employees) are now required to contribute 1.5% of their salary to offset health care costs. State and local employees&#x27; contributions to the two largest pension systems increased by 10%, from 5% to 5.5% of their annual salaries and increased the retirement benefit age for new public employees, from 55 to 60 years. In 2008, Corzine approved a law that increased the retirement age from 60 to 62, required that government workers and teachers earn $7,500 per year to qualify for a pension, eliminated Lincoln&#x27;s Birthday as a state worker holiday, allowed the state to offer incentives not to take health insurance and required municipal employees work 20 hours per week to get health benefits. 

As part of his attempt to balance the budget, Corzine decreased funding to most programs and localities including state universities and colleges. The first of these decreases came with the 2007 budget. Rutgers University and other New Jersey state universities raised tuition, cut hundreds of sections of classes, and several sports teams. With the latest decrease in funding for 2009, most state institutions have less funding than they had a decade ago. Despite the $15 million in cuts, Rutgers went ahead with previous agreed upon raises of $15 million to their executive faculty. This resulted in Rutgers making $30 million in cuts.

Corzine has been the only New Jersey governor in recent memory to make any headway in addressing the crisis of municipal funding. While not directly touching the third rail of New Jersey governance – property taxes – Corzine&#x27;s reform of the school funding formula (passed and signed in January 2008) resulted in significant relief to many New Jersey towns with outsize school costs but limited tax base. The plan survived a legal challenge and was declared constitutional by the New Jersey Supreme Court on May 28, 2009.

Corzine championed expanding government health and education programs. He planned to require every resident to enroll in a health plan and have taxpayers help pick up the tab for all the welfare low- and middle-income residents. In June 2008, state legislators voted for the first phase of that program mandating health care coverage and Corzine signed it into law in July. 

Corzine spent some $200,000 of public funds on advertisements to promote a referendum on the 2007 New Jersey ballot to borrow $450 million to fund stem cell research. The referendum faced strong opposition and was rejected despite the fact that $270 million had previously been approved to build stem cell research centers.

Corzine, a death penalty opponent, as governor supported and presided over abolition of capital punishment in New Jersey and replacing it with life imprisonment. After the legislature passed and he signed it into law, New Jersey became the first state to legislatively eliminate capital punishment since 1965. Although the bill was not passed until late in 2007, New Jersey had not executed any criminals since 1963. Because the penalty was never used and often reversed upon appeal, it was viewed as a form of extended suffering for victims&#x27; families by some supporters of its abolition. Before the enactment of the new law, he commuted the death sentences of all death row inmates to life in prison. Corzine also has supported early New Jersey efforts at gun control.

Corzine was one of several United States Governors – including Martin O&#x27;Malley of Maryland, Mike Beebe of Arkansas, and Eliot Spitzer of New York – who were early supporters of Hillary Clinton&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign. He raised $1 million for her campaign. He, Bill Clinton, Eliot Spitzer, Chuck Schumer, and Charlie Rangel co-hosted Clinton&#x27;s October 25, 2007 60th-birthday party. He remained a committed Clinton superdelegate late into the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primary season. If the Democratic National Committee had decided to recontest the Michigan and Florida primaries, Corzine and Ed Rendell were prepared to spearhead Clinton&#x27;s fundraising in for those races. Towards the end of the primary season in April 2008, Corzine made it clear that although he was a Clinton supporter, his superdelegate vote would be determined by the popular vote. After her win in the April 22, 2008 Pennsylvania Democratic primary and a calculation of popular votes that excluded caucuses and included the controversial Michigan and Florida Democratic primaries, Corzine reaffirmed his support for her. Once Barack Obama became the presumptive nominee, Corzine became a prominent spokesperson for Obama&#x27;s agenda.

Corzine was among a group of big (in terms of population) state governors, such as Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger, who moved his state Republican and Democratic primaries to February 5, 2008, the date of Super Tuesday, 2008. He was also among a group of prominent Democratic politicians (that included Ted Kennedy and Barack Obama) who received political contributions from Norman Hsu that he ended up donating to charity.

In November 2008, in response to the ongoing economic downturn, Corzine proposed an economic recovery package consisting of additional massive spending, accelerated capital improvement spending and reforms and cuts to the corporate income tax. As of December 2008 many elements of the plan had been approved by the Democrats in the NJ Legislature. On January 2, 2009, Corzine joined the governors of four other states in urging the federal government to provide $1 trillion in aid to the country&#x27;s 50 state governments to help pay for education, welfare and infrastructure as states struggle with steep budget deficits amid a deepening recession.

===Government shutdown===

Corzine, in attempting to pass the 2007 fiscal year budget, clashed with a few fellow state Democrats in the New Jersey General Assembly, particularly over the proposed increase of the state&#x27;s sales tax from 6% to 7%. Corzine said that he would not accept a budget that did not include the sales tax increase. After the legislature failed to pass Corzine&#x27;s budget by the midnight deadline of July 1, 2006, he signed an executive order that immediately closed down all non-essential state government services, such as road construction projects. Legislators failed to resolve the situation by July 4 and casinos, among other governmentally-regulated industries, closed their doors at 8:00 am on July 5. Corzine called the shutdown &quot;deplorable&quot;, though he refused to negotiate with legislators and accept alternate plans that did not increase the sales tax. Some surmised the casino closure was an effort to encourage reluctant South Jersey legislators to break the impasse.

After six days of state government shutdown, Corzine and Assembly Democrats agreed to raise the state sales tax to 7% with half of the 1% increase going to the state budget and the other half going to property tax relief. On July 8, 2006, the $30 billion state budget, with the sales tax agreement, passed both houses and Governor Corzine signed the budget into law ending the budget impasse.

===Toll hike plan===
Initially, Corzine opposed privatization of the New Jersey Turnpike. On January 8, 2008, to address ongoing structural budget issues, Governor Corzine proposed a four-part proposal including an overall reduction in spending, a constitutional amendment to require more voter approval for state borrowing, an executive order prohibiting the use of one-time revenues to balance the budget and a controversial plan to raise some $38 billion by leasing the Garden State Parkway, the New Jersey Turnpike, and other toll roads for at least 75 years to a new public benefit corporation that could sell bonds secured by future tolls, which it would be allowed to raise by 50% plus inflation every four years beginning in 2010. Corzine vowed to get that plan through the state legislature by March, but held off for nearly a month before releasing the details. Upon learning how the plan would work, New Jersey native residents railed against it, comparing it to using one credit card to pay off another, pointing out that it would create hardship for commuters and noting that it would actually increase the state&#x27;s $32 billion debt. Corzine later wrote that only after the proposal was released did he discover &quot;the harsh reality: the public intensely disliked the idea&quot; and that, in retrospect, he &quot;should have pressed harder to identify the most salient arguments against the plan and developed a strategy to get in front of and respond to those challenges&quot;.

===Carla Katz===
Corzine, who was running for the United States Senate in the spring of 1999, met Carla Katz, the then married president of Local 1034 of the Communications Workers of America (CWA), in the same apartment building where he resided in Hoboken; the CWA represents the largest number of state workers in New Jersey. As Katz later recalled, Corzine offered her a job on his Senate campaign, but she declined the offer. Corzine and the still married Katz were soon dating, and they began appearing in public as a couple in early 2002, shortly after Corzine&#x27;s unofficial separation from his wife, Joanne. (The Corzines divorced the following year.) For more than two years Corzine was romantically involved and living with Katz. She lived with him at his apartment building in Hoboken from April 2002 until August 2004.

After Corzine&#x27;s breakup with Katz, their lawyers negotiated a financial payout in November 2004. According to press accounts, the settlement for Katz exceeded $6 million, including cash (in part used to buy her $1.1 million condominium in Hoboken), a college trust fund to educate her children, a 2005 Volvo sport utility vehicle, and Corzine forgave a $470,000 loan he had made to Katz in 2002 to buy out her ex-husband&#x27;s share of their home in Alexandria Township. Katz enrolled in Seton Hall University School of Law on a full scholarship in 2004. Corzine later acknowledged he had given $15,000 to Katz&#x27;s brother-in-law, Rocco Riccio, a former state employee who was forced to resign after being accused of examining income tax returns for political purposes. At the time, Katz was president of the CWA Local 1034, which bargains on behalf of many state employees.

In the summer of 2005, when Corzine was running in the New Jersey gubernatorial election, news first emerged of his relationship with Katz and the money she had received. Corzine was elected governor despite the scandal. In the fall of 2006, during an impasse in contract negotiations between the Corzine administration and the state&#x27;s seven major state employee unions (including the CWA), Katz contacted the governor by phone and e-mail to lobby for a renewal of the negotiations. Their relationship and the financial settlement Katz received after their breakup led to allegations of many potential conflicts of interest in labor negotiations while Corzine was governor. A state ethics panel, acting on a complaint from Bogota mayor Steve Lonegan, ruled in May 2007 that Katz&#x27;s contact with Corzine during negotiations did not violate the governor&#x27;s code of conduct.

Separately, New Jersey Republican State Committee Chairman Tom Wilson filed a lawsuit to release all e-mail correspondence between Corzine and Katz during the contract negotiations. On May 30, 2008, New Jersey Superior Court Judge Paul Innes ruled that at least 745 pages of e-mail records should be made public, but Corzine&#x27;s lawyers immediately appealed the decision and the appellate court overturned the trial court ruling. Wilson then filed an appeal to the New Jersey Supreme Court, asking the Supreme Court to reinstate the trial court ruling.

Corzine won his case on appeal. On March 18, 2009, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled it would not hear arguments in the case, effectively ending the legal battle to make his e-mails with Katz public. Corzine spent approximately $127,000 of taxpayer funds to keep the e-mails secret. Nonetheless, on August 1, 2010, &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot; published 123 of the Corzine-Katz e-mails, revealing the extent of their personal contact during negotiations over a new state government workers contract in early 2007.

===Appointments===
Corzine continued to serve in the U.S. Senate while running for governor, which ensured that he could resign from the Senate and appoint a Democrat as his successor if he won and allowed him to retain his Senate seat if he lost. Speculation was that he would appoint a Democrat from one of the congressional districts in New Jersey, perhaps Congressmen Rob Andrews, Rush Holt, or Frank Pallone. Corzine, once he was Governor-Elect, said on November 11, 2005, that he was strongly considering appointing State Senator Nia Gill to fill his vacant seat in the United States Senate. Corzine said about Gill that she was &quot;an extraordinarily capable woman&quot;. Gill for her part told the Associated Press &quot;I have the qualifications. If I am chosen by Jon, I am more than qualified to rise to the occasion.&quot; He strongly hinted he might appoint Governor Richard Codey although on November 23, 2005, Codey announced that he was not interested in pursuing the seat. On December 9, 2005, Corzine named his friend, who lived and lives in the same apartment building, U.S. Rep. Robert Menendez, a Democrat, to succeed him.

One of Corzine&#x27;s first nominations was that of Zulima Farber as New Jersey Attorney General. She served for approximately seven months until an ethics investigation concluded that she had acted improperly by going to the location where local police in Fairview, New Jersey had stopped her boyfriend, Hamlet Gore, for driving with a suspended license and an expired vehicle registration. Corzine said he did not ask for Farber&#x27;s resignation.

On February 9, 2006, after many scandals regarding financial mishandling at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Corzine nominated Robert Del Tufo, the former Attorney General of New Jersey and U.S. Attorney, as chairman of the board of trustees. Corzine also nominated Oliver Quinn, Prudential Financial&#x27;s vice president and chief ethics officer, as vice chairman of the board.

Corzine&#x27;s commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection and Chief of Staff, Lisa P. Jackson was nominated as the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency. She was confirmed by the Senate on January 22, 2009.

===Motorcade accident===
On April 12, 2007, Corzine and 25-year-old aide Samantha Gordon were injured in an automobile accident on the Garden State Parkway near Galloway Township while traveling from the New Jersey Conference of Mayors in Atlantic City to Drumthwacket, his residence in Princeton, to meet with radio personality Don Imus and the Rutgers University women&#x27;s basketball team.

The New Jersey State Police determined that Corzine&#x27;s SUV, driven by a state trooper, was traveling in excess of with its emergency lights flashing when the collision occurred. A pickup truck drifted onto the shoulder and swerved back onto the lane, and another pickup truck swerved to avoid the truck and hit the Governor&#x27;s SUV, causing the SUV to hit the guardrail. The State Police reviewed roadside camera recordings and E-ZPass records to track down the driver of the truck; he was not charged with any violation.

Corzine and the trooper were flown by helicopter to Cooper University Hospital in Camden, a Level I trauma center. The aide was taken by ambulance to Atlantic City Medical Center. Neither the NJ State Trooper nor the aide was seriously injured, but Corzine suffered broken bones, including an open fracture of the left femur, 11 broken ribs, a broken sternum, a broken collarbone, a fractured lower vertebra, and a facial cut that required plastic surgery. The Governor was not wearing a seat belt. Friends had long said that they had rarely seen him wear one. When asked why the state trooper who was driving would not have asked Corzine to put on his seat belt, a staffer said the governor was &quot;not always amenable to suggestion&quot;. The Superintendent of State Police has also noted that the trooper could be charged if the crash were preventable.

By April 23, 2007, Corzine&#x27;s doctors had upgraded him from critical to stable condition. He was sedated and unable to speak because of a breathing tube in his throat, and as such, was unable to perform his duties as governor. In accordance with the New Jersey State Constitution, New Jersey Senate President Richard Codey assumed the position of acting governor for the short period from April 12 until May 7, 2007. In 2005, voters had approved an amendment to the state constitution to provide for a lieutenant governor who would succeed the governor in the event of a vacancy or assume gubernatorial duties in the event of incapacitation, but that position would not be filled until 2010.

Corzine left the hospital on April 30, 2007. He returned to Drumthwacket, where he recuperated and used a videoconferencing center (installed at his expense) to communicate with legislators. He issued an apology, paid a $46 ticket for not wearing a seat belt, and he appeared in a public service announcement advocating seat belts, which opened with the words &quot;I&#x27;m New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine, and I should be dead.&quot;

It was reported that Corzine, not taxpayers, would pay his medical bills.

===Public opinion===

During the first months of his administration, Corzine experienced favorable approval ratings. According to a March 2006 Fairleigh Dickinson PublicMind Poll, 47% of New Jersey voters approved of the job Corzine was doing, while 16% disapproved. Peter Woolley, director of the PublicMind, noted, &quot;the numbers are pretty good for a New Jersey governor heading full tilt into an unprecedented budget crisis.&quot; Much of the good will that was indicated by the March poll was quickly diminished, and in April 2006, a PublicMind poll showed that Corzine&#x27;s approval rating had eroded to 39% while his disapproval rating increased to 36%. By July 2006, the Governor&#x27;s ratings recovered to some extent from the April decline and in September of the same year it was clear that Corzine&#x27;s approvals had not suffered from the summer conflict over the budget and the sales tax hike; 51% of New Jersey voters approved of the governor&#x27;s handling of his job while 31% disapproved. His PublicMind poll ratings remained relatively stable and healthy through the rest of 2006 and 2007 with his average approvals at 54% and his average disapprovals at 29%.

In January 2008, prior to the State of the State address Corzine was at 48% approving 32% disapproving, according to the PublicMind poll. But another FDU PublicMind poll taken in late January, after the State of the State address, showed that governor&#x27;s ratings were slipping; 41% of voters approved of the job Corzine was doing while 39% reported that they disapproved. The decline was largely in response to the governor&#x27;s plan to raise tolls on the New Jersey Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway. February 2008 was not any kinder, as a PublicMind poll indicated that his numbers continued to slip with disapprovals catching up to approvals with 42% of voters approving and 43% of voters disapproving. Woolley remarked on the decline saying, &quot;Considering the beating he has taken on his toll plan, it&#x27;s remarkable that his numbers are not a good deal worse.&quot; The governor&#x27;s approval ratings showed no recovery through September 2008 with his approvals and disapprovals averaging 42% and 43% respectively. Coincident with the presidential campaign, Corzine&#x27;s approval ratings saw some improvement.

In January 2009 he stood at 46% approving and 40% disapproving. Woolley asserted that the governor was faring relatively well in public opinion considering &quot;the enormous and growing pressure on the state budget and on the governor to protect various constituencies&quot;. Come March 2009, the PublicMind Poll found, &quot;Gov. Jon Corzine&#x27;s standing with the New Jersey public is suffering along with the economy,&quot; and as a result his approvals began to slip with 40% of voters approving and 43% disapproving. His approvals continued to decline in April as he contended with the budget and the financial crisis with 40% approving and 49% disapproving. At the end of his term, in January 2010, Corzine&#x27;s approvals landed at their lowest point during the administration with 33% approving and 58% disapproving.

==Philanthropy and academia==
Corzine has been active with a number of philanthropic and civic organizations. He currently serves as a member of the Board of Directors of Covenant House and is on the board of the New Jersey Reentry Corporation. His civic work has involved serving on the boards of several organizations in the New York-New Jersey area, including the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, the New York Philharmonic, the New York Child Study Center and the NYC Partnership. In addition, Corzine has served as co-chair of the National Commission on Capital Budgeting under President Clinton, chairman of the Treasury&#x27;s Government Borrowing Committee and Chairman of the Public Securities Association.

He served on the board of trustees of the University of Chicago and served as an ex-officio member of the board of trustees of Princeton University. Corzine was the J.L. Weinberg Visiting Professor of Public Policy at Princeton in 2010 and 2011. He currently is serving at Fairleigh Dickinson University as chairman of an advisory board that is working to establish a graduate school of public and global affairs. Corzine is also serving as a visiting lecturer on politics and public policy at Farleigh&#x27;s Wroxton campus in the United Kingdom.

==MF Global==
Corzine was appointed CEO and Chairman of MF Global, a multinational futures broker and bond dealer, in March 2010.

MF Global&#x27;s stock price declined two-thirds in the final week of October 2011 and its credit rating was reduced making its debt high-yield debt following huge quarterly losses. On October 31, 2011, trading was halted on shares of MF Global prior to the market opening, and soon thereafter MF Global announced that it had declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Shortly afterwards, federal regulators began an investigation into hundreds of millions of dollars in missing customer funds. Corzine resigned as CEO on November 4, 2011, after having retained the services of defense attorney Andrew J. Levander. It was reported that Corzine declined a severance package worth $12.1 million. MF Global&#x27;s collapse was one of the ten biggest bankruptcies in U.S. history.

Corzine was subpoenaed to appear before a House committee on December 8, 2011, to answer questions regarding 1.2 billion dollars of missing money from MF Global client accounts. He testified before the committee, &quot;I simply do not know where the money is, or why the accounts have not been reconciled to date,&quot; and that given the number of money transfers in the final days of trading at MF Global, he didn&#x27;t know specifics of the movement of the funds. He also denied authorizing any misuse of customer funds. In March 2012, Bloomberg reported on a memo produced by congressional investigators that quoted an internal company e-mail relating to a $175 million transfer that was a subject of their investigation. Initial media reports suggested impropriety on Corzine&#x27;s part, but this was later disproved. According to the New York Times, the employee responsible for the transfer emailed Corzine stating the transfer was a &quot;House Wire&quot;, meaning it came from the firm&#x27;s own account. The instructions Corzine had given were to deal with several overdrafts at JPMorgan Chase, but never related to any specific accounts or specific transfers made. A spokesperson for Corzine responded that Corzine &quot;never directed Ms. O&#x27;Brien or anyone else regarding which account should be used to cure the overdrafts, and he never directed that customer funds should be used for that purpose. Nor was he informed that customer funds had been used for that purpose&quot;. In fact, as the New York Times reported, Corzine had been given specific assurances that the transfer in question was proper, and that no customer funds had been used. Subsequent court filings also attest to this fact. On November 5, 2013, The New York Times reported that MF Global customers would likely recover 100 percent of their funds. A spokesman for Corzine said &quot;Mr. Corzine is very pleased that all customers will receive a full recovery. This is a great outcome, which has been anticipated for many months.&quot; Customers have since received distributions making them whole.

In June 2013, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed civil charges against Corzine for using funds from MF&#x27;s customer accounts for corporate purposes. &quot;Corzine is charged with one count of failure to segregate and misuse of customer funds and one count of failure to supervise diligently,&quot; a news report said. The commission drew on extensive taped Corzine phone conversations in filing the complaint. Corzine&#x27;s attorney Levander issued a statement contesting the charges when they were filed.

In 2013, Corzine, and managers including Bradley Abelow and Henri Steenkamp, appealed a court ruling relating to repayments to customers of the bankrupt brokerage. A spokesman for Corzine made clear that the appeal was not an attempt to delay payments to customers, but due to a disagreement regarding how those claims would be handled by the trustee after they were paid. Corzine fully supported customers receiving 100 percent of their money and had no desire for this to be delayed. There was nothing preventing the trustee from making full distributions immediately and litigating the appeal after the fact. Ultimately all customers were paid in full.

On January 5, 2017, Corzine and the CFTC agreed to a settlement order requiring Corzine to pay a $5 million penalty for his role in MF Global&#x27;s collapse. Corzine also agreed to be permanently barred from working for a futures commission merchant or registering with the CFTC in any capacity.

==Electoral history==





==Personal life==
Corzine married his high school sweetheart, Joanne Dougherty, in 1969 at the age of 22, and their 33-year marriage produced three children – Jennifer, Josh, and Jeffrey. The couple separated in 2002 and were divorced in November 2003. Corzine&#x27;s younger son Jeffrey died by suicide in Mexico on March 13, 2014 age 31.

Corzine had lived with his wife in Summit, New Jersey. After their separation, Corzine moved to a condominium apartment in Hoboken.

In April 2010, &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; announced the engagement of Corzine and psychotherapist Sharon Elghanayan (&quot;née&quot; Levine), whom he had been dating since 2004. On November 23, 2010, Corzine married Elghanayan in a ceremony presided over by Chief Justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court Stuart Rabner, according to an announcement in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Elghanayan is a graduate of Rutgers University and New York University.

<doc id="335079" wikidata="Q841867" url="?curid=335079" title="Who's That Girl (soundtrack)">
<text>Who&#x27;s That Girl is the first soundtrack album by American singer and songwriter Madonna. It was released on July 21, 1987, by Sire Records to promote the film of the same name. It also contains songs by her label mates Scritti Politti, Duncan Faure, Club Nouveau, Coati Mundi and Michael Davidson. The soundtrack is credited as a Madonna album, despite her only performing four of the nine tracks on the album. After the commercial success of the film &quot;Desperately Seeking Susan&quot; (1985), in which she co-starred, Madonna wanted to act in another comedy film titled &quot;Slammer&quot;, about a woman named Nikki Finn who was falsely accused of homicide. However, due to the critical and commercial failure of her adventure film &quot;Shanghai Surprise&quot; (1986), Warner Bros. was initially reluctant to greenlight the project but later agreed.

Madonna began working on the soundtrack in December 1986, and contacted Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray, who had worked as producers on her third studio album &quot; True Blue&quot; (1986). She felt that an uptempo song and a downtempo song were needed for the album. Leonard composed the music for the uptempo song, with Madonna providing the melody and lyrics. The singer named the track &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; and, believing this to be a better title than &quot;Slammer&quot;, changed the name of the film to the same. Together, Madonna and Leonard also developed the downtempo ballad &quot;The Look of Love&quot;. Two more songs were composed for the film with Bray, the first being the dance track &quot;Causing a Commotion&quot;, and the other being &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop&quot;, a track inspired by Sixties Motown and the group Martha and the Vandellas.

After its release, the &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; soundtrack received a mostly negative response from critics. Some reviews described the album as plain and incomplete, although the title track and &quot;The Look of Love&quot; were praised as its highlights. The soundtrack was a commercial success, reaching the top ten of the album charts of the United States, Austria, Canada, France, New Zealand, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, while topping the charts of Argentina, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, and the European Album chart. The album went on to sell 6 million copies worldwide.

Three of the Madonna tracks were released as singles. The title track became her sixth number-one single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, making her the first artist to accumulate six number one singles in the 1980s and the first female performer to get that many number ones as a solo act. &quot;Causing a Commotion&quot; was released as the second single and reached number two on the Hot 100. &quot;The Look of Love&quot; was a European market only release, reaching the top ten in the United Kingdom. Another track, &quot;Turn It Up,&quot; was a promotional release in the United States, reaching number 15 on the dance charts. &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; received a further promotion from the successful Who&#x27;s That Girl World Tour.

== Background ==
The 1985 comedy film &quot;Desperately Seeking Susan&quot;, in which Madonna co-starred, was a commercial success, prompting her to take further interest in acting. For her next screen project, she picked another comedy film initially titled &quot;Slammer&quot;, but later named &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot;. Madonna played the character of Nikki Finn, a young woman accused of homicide who insisted that she was innocent. Released on parole, she was determined to clear her name. Along with a character named Loudon Trott (played by Griffin Dunne), she gets caught up in 36 hours of high adventure, culminating in a scene where Nikki interrupts a wedding to reveal the identity of the real murderer. Regarding the character Nikki, Madonna commented,

&quot;I had a lot in common with Nikki. She&#x27;s courageous and sweet and funny and misjudged. But she clears her name in the end, and that&#x27;s always good to do. I&#x27;m continuously doing that with the public. I liked Nikki&#x27;s tough side and her sweet side. The toughness is only a mask for the vulnerability she feels.&quot;

However, in the light of the bad publicity surrounding Madonna and her then-husband Sean Penn, coupled with the fact that their comedy film &quot;Shanghai Surprise&quot; had failed commercially, she had to fight hard to persuade Warner Bros. to greenlight the project. She also wanted her close friend James Foley to direct the film, proclaiming him to be a &quot;genius&quot;. Foley had previously directed the music videos of her songs &quot;Live to Tell&quot;, &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; and &quot;True Blue&quot;.

== Development ==

Having some specific ideas in her mind about the music of the film, Madonna contacted Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray, who had helped to write and produce her third studio album &quot;True Blue&quot; in 1986. Madonna explained to them that she needed an uptempo song and a downtempo song. Madonna came to the recording studio one Thursday, and Leonard handed her a cassette of a recording of the chorus, which he had just finished working on. Madonna went to the backroom and completed the melody and the lyrics of the song, while Leonard worked on the other parts of it. After finishing the lyrics, Madonna decided to name the song &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot;, and changed the title of &quot;Slammer&quot; to the same, considering it to be a better name. In Fred Bronson&#x27;s book &quot;The Billboard Book of Number 1 Hits&quot;, Leonard explained that the song was recorded in one day with Madonna recording her vocals only once. Additional guitar and percussion tracks were added later.

The downtempo song was developed on the following day, with Madonna writing the lyrics and Leonard composing the melody. Named &quot;The Look of Love&quot;, the song contains the line &quot;Nowhere to run, no place to hide. From the look of love, from the eyes of pride&quot;. Madonna was inspired by the look that actor James Stewart gave actress Grace Kelly in the 1954 film &quot;Rear Window&quot;. Madonna said: &quot;I can&#x27;t describe it, but that is the way I want someone to look at me when he loves me. It&#x27;s the purest look of love and adoration. Like surrender. It&#x27;s devastating.&quot; After &quot;The Look of Love&quot;, Madonna went on to develop two further songs with Bray as the producer. The first was called &quot;Causing a Commotion&quot;, and was inspired by Penn and the couple&#x27;s often tumultuous relationship. Madonna felt that her marriage to Penn was on the verge of breaking up, due to Penn&#x27;s abusive and violent nature. In a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; article dated September 10, 1987, Madonna spoke about Penn&#x27;s impact on her life and the song: &quot;I don&#x27;t like violence. I never condone hitting anyone, and I never thought that any violence should have taken place. But on the other hand, I understood Sean&#x27;s anger, and believe me, I have wanted to hit him many times. I never would you know, because I realize that it would just make things worse. [...] I felt like he was &#x27;Causing a Commotion&#x27; to purposefully distract me. I wrote this song and vented my frustration in it.&quot;

== Composition ==

The title track is composed in Madonna&#x27;s typical style—mixing a drum machine, bubbling bass synth line, and the sound of stringed instruments. According to Rikky Rooksby, author of &quot;The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna&quot;, the three parts of the song, namely the bridge, where Madonna sings &quot;what can help me now&quot;, the chorus and the verse flow together in a coherent manner, with the chorus incorporating a haunting effect. The song epitomized Madonna&#x27;s interest in Hispanic culture that continued after the release of her 1987 single &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot;. Leonard and Madonna had added Spanish phrases in the chorus, over the trumpets of the second verse, and also in the added instrumental break in the middle. &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; also makes use of the sonic effect brought about by the combination of multiple vocal lines, which had been previously used by groups like The Beach Boys in their singles &quot;God Only Knows&quot; (1966) and &quot;I Get Around&quot; (1964) as well as R.E.M.&#x27;s singles &quot;Fall on Me&quot; (1986) and &quot;Near Wild Heaven&quot; (1991). &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; employs this effect on the last chorus where three or four different vocal hooks are intertwined.

The second track &quot;Causing a Commotion&quot; has a danceable, up-tempo groove. The musical arrangement consists of a number of hooks interpolating with each other. It begins with the chorus, where Madonna sings the line &quot;I&#x27;ve got the moves baby, You&#x27;ve got the motions, If we got together we be causing a commotion.&quot; The verses are accompanied by a four-note descending bassline and interjecting staccato chords. The lyrics make reference to Madonna&#x27;s 1985 single &quot;Into the Groove&quot; and have three parts to the vocal harmony. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Walt Disney Music Company, the song is set in the time signature of common time with a tempo of 192 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of B major with Madonna&#x27;s voice spanning from the high-note of C3 to B5. The song has a basic sequence of B–Fm7–B–F9–B6 as its chord progression.

&quot;The Look of Love&quot; starts off with a low bass synth line and a slow backing track. It is followed by the sound of percussion and a high register note, contrasting with the bassline. The song continues in this way until the last verse, which is backed by the sound of an acoustic guitar. A two-part vocal is found in the line &quot;Nowhere to run, no place to hide&quot;. Rooksby felt that Madonna&#x27;s voice sounded &quot;expressive&quot; when she sings the line &quot;From the look of love&quot; and utters the word &quot;look&quot; over the D minor chord present underneath. The word is sung in a higher note of the musical scale, thus giving an impression of the suspension like the quality of the minor ninth chord, dissociating it from the harmony of the other notes. The song is set in the time signature of common time, with a moderate tempo of 80 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of D minor, with Madonna&#x27;s voice spanning the notes C5 to B3. &quot;The Look of Love&quot; has a basic sequence of C–Dm–Fm–B as its chord progression.

&quot;Can&#x27;t Stop&quot; has a high pitched keyboard sound embedded in between the sound of a drum machine and clarinet. The lyrics essentially refer to the idea that &quot;I want my man and I am going to get him whatever&quot;. Rooksby noticed that the instrumental break in the song repeats the chorus, with a synth line added on the top. He felt that &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop&quot;, at 4:45 length, was a good example of the division of Madonna&#x27;s songs between dance music—where the length is important—and the requirement of classic pop songs, which can vary from two minutes to four minutes. J. Randy Taraborrelli, in his book &quot;&quot;, described Faure&#x27;s song &quot;24 Hours&quot; as a slow track that fails to build up momentum. Joe Brown from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described Davidson&#x27;s &quot;Turn it Up&quot; as consisting of a slow background synth, that transforms into a rapidly progressing beat, with Davidson&#x27;s singing reminiscent of the Beastie Boys.

== Promotion ==

=== Tour ===

Madonna performed &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot;, &quot;Causing a Commotion,&quot; and &quot;The Look of Love&quot; on her 1987 Who&#x27;s That Girl World Tour. It was her second concert tour, promoting &quot;True Blue&quot; and the soundtrack. Madonna trained herself physically with aerobics, jogging and weight-lifting, to cope with the choreography and the dance routines. For the costumes, she collaborated with designer Marlene Stewart, expanding on the idea of bringing her music video characters to life on stage. The stage was huge, with four video screens, multimedia projectors and a flight of stairs in the middle. Leonard became the music director and encouraged Madonna to go with the idea of rearranging her older songs and presenting them in a new format.

The show consisted of seven costume changes, with song-and-dance routines with an encore consisting of the title song &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; and &quot;Holiday&quot;. The tour also addressed social causes like AIDS, during &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot;. Who&#x27;s That Girl tour was critically appreciated and was a commercial success, grossing a total of US $25 million, with Madonna playing in front of 1.5 million people over the course of the tour. According to &quot;Pollstar&quot;, it was the second top female concert tour of 1987, behind Tina Turner&#x27;s Break Every Rule Tour.

=== Singles ===
&quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; was released as the lead single from the soundtrack, on June 30, 1987. A latin pop influenced song, it became Madonna&#x27;s sixth single to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, making her the first artist to accumulate six number-one singles in the 1980s, and the first female performer to get that many number-ones as a solo act. It also reached the top the charts in United Kingdom, Canada, Netherlands, Ireland and Belgium. In the music video Madonna did not portray her film character Nikki Finn, instead she continued with her Hispanic look from the &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot; music video. This time she appeared dressed boyishly in a wide-brimmed Spanish hat and bolero jacket—a combination which would later become a fashion trend. &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; was nominated for &quot;Best Song From A Motion Picture&quot; at the 1988 Grammy Awards and &quot;Best Original Song&quot; at the 1988 Golden Globe Awards.

The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Causing a Commotion&quot;, was released on August 25, 1987. It was criticized by music reviewers for being a sub-standard Madonna single, but enjoyed commercial success, reaching the top ten in New Zealand, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. In the United States, the single quickly climbed up the chart, ultimately peaking at number two in the week of October 24, 1987, the same week Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Bad&quot; advanced to the pole position. It remained in second position for three weeks, before descending from the chart. &quot;Causing a Commotion&quot; reached the top of the Hot Dance Club Play chart.

The third song released from the album was the European single, &quot;The Look of Love&quot;. In the United Kingdom, &quot;The Look of Love&quot; was released on December 12, 1987, and entered the UK Singles Chart at number 15. The next week, it reached a peak of nine on the chart, her first single to miss the top five since &quot;Lucky Star&quot; (1984). &quot;Turn It Up&quot; was released as a single prior to its inclusion in the album in 1987. Described by Joe Brown of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; as &quot;gratingly banal&quot; and its singer as &quot;one of Madonna&#x27;s photogenic protegés&quot;, the song was a success on the Dance Club charts of &quot;Billboard&quot;, peaking at number 15.

== Critical reception ==
The soundtrack album was not well received by music critics, some of whom went on comment that the title track is the record&#x27;s highlight. &quot;MusicHound&quot;″s rock guide called it an &quot;embarrassment&quot; to an &quot;ambitious artist&quot;. Jim Farber from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave a negative review, though Noah Robischon from the same magazine complimented the title track, saying that Madonna had &quot;pushed synergy over the borderline.&quot; Bill Lamb from About.com said that the songs were not among Madonna&#x27;s best music. Taraborrelli commented that &quot;the soundtrack was once again the reminder of Madonna&#x27;s power and status as one of the most important singers of the 80s, because it was only her songs which gained prominence, albeit not being her best, though &#x27;The Look of Love&#x27; is an exotic ballad.&quot; Author Mary Cross, in her biography &quot;Madonna: A Biography&quot; said that &quot;the soundtrack slips up because of the film.&quot; Allen Metz and Carol Benson, authors of &quot;The Madonna Companion: Two Decades of Commentary&quot;, said that &quot;&quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; has done what it was released for, put money in Warner&#x27;s pockets, but [adds] nothing in Madonna&#x27;s catalogue&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted in his review for Allmusic that &quot;In the strictest sense [the record] isn&#x27;t a Madonna album — it&#x27;s a soundtrack album&quot;, adding that it features &quot;competent but uninspiring dance-pop by [various artists]&quot;. David Denby from &quot;New York&quot; magazine commented that &quot;there&#x27;s nothing absolutely wrong with the soundtrack. But it&#x27;s just that it has the misfortune of being associated with such an unfortunate movie, that the album actually does not hold up to you well.&quot; He added that &quot;The Look of Love&quot; was a hidden gem in Madonna&#x27;s catalogue. Don Shewey from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; commented that &quot;although essentially a Madonna album, the soundtrack does not boast a truly memorable song, rather there is the inclusion of the failed Warner artist songs, like the Coati Mundi song &#x27;El Coco Loco&#x27; and Duncan Faure&#x27;s uncannily Beatles-esque &#x27;24 Hours&#x27;. For most buyers though this album is the new Madonna album.&quot;

Robert Christgau gave the album a (C–) and said &quot;From Scritti Politti and Coati Mundi you expect trickier spin, but they&#x27;re outsiders, and outsiders times soundtrack equals contract work. For her own movie, though, the decade&#x27;s purest pop icon should do better than sloppy seconds. Or neat seconds—worse still.&quot; Ed Blank from &quot;Pittsburgh Press&quot; commented: &quot;It feels like the sole purpose to create the soundtrack was to show it in the film.&quot; Jay Boyar from &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; praised the songs on the soundtrack, claiming that &quot;Madonna brings forth a heart-breaking warmth in &#x27;The Look of Love&#x27; and a club stomping feel with &#x27;Causing a Commotion&#x27;. With the movie&#x27;s fate being sealed, luckily for her Madonna can sing.&quot; Gyan Singh from &quot;The Miami Herald&quot;, while reviewing the film, said that the &quot;Only solace of the movie is the soundtrack, the songs—especially those by Madonna—are actually good.&quot; Don McLeese from &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, while reviewing Madonna&#x27;s Who&#x27;s That Girl World Tour, said that &quot;the soundtrack&#x27;s songs sound good live&quot;. Larry Geller from &quot;The Advocate&quot; gave a positive review, saying that &quot;&quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; will be the soundtrack album of the summer.&quot; Stephen Holden from &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave an equally positive review, saying that the &quot;soundtrack album is full of engaging pop fluff. One of the hottest singles of the year, Madonna&#x27;s bilingual title song has the buoyant bounce of an acrobat doing somersaults on a trampoline. &#x27;The Look of Love&#x27; is as memorable a ballad as [Madonna&#x27;s 1986 single] &#x27;Live to Tell&#x27;, and &#x27;24 Hours&#x27;, sung by Duncan Faure, skillfully fuses Beatles-styled vocals with 80&#x27;s synthesizer-pop underpinnings.&quot; Daniel Brogan from &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; said that &quot;since this soundtrack isn&#x27;t really a Madonna album, this is no surprise that it appears as incomplete.&quot;

== Commercial performance ==
After its release, the album debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number forty-six on August 15, 1987, the same week that the title song &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; reached the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In the week ending September 12, 1987, the record reached its peak position at number seven. It remained on the chart for twenty-eight weeks, and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of one million copies across the United States. In Canada, the album debuted at eighty-five on the &quot;RPM&quot; Albums Chart, on August 1, 1987. After seven weeks, the soundtrack climbed to its peak of four on the chart. The soundtrack was placed at position thirty-seven, on the &quot;RPM&quot; Top 100 Albums for 1987 chart and was present on the chart for thirty weeks.

In the United Kingdom, the album debuted and peaked at number four on the UK Albums Chart on August 1, 1987, becoming the highest debut of the week. It fell out one place the next week, where it stayed for other three weeks. &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; was present on the chart for twenty-five weeks and ended as the most popular original soundtrack album of 1987 in the country. The soundtrack was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipments of 300,000 copies across the United Kingdom. The album was less successful in Australia, where it debuted and peaked at number twenty-four. It entered the New Zealand Album chart at twelve on September 6, 1987. After two weeks, the album reached its peak at number six. In Austria, &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; became the best selling debut of the week, charting at number seven, on August 15, 1987, ultimately reaching number five. By August 1, 1987 &quot; Who&#x27;s That Girl &quot; sold 140,000 albums and 65,000 singles in Italy in few weeks. In Spain, the soundtrack was released in August and reached sales of 57,049 units by November of the same year. It was later certified with platinum from PROMUSICAE for shipments of 100,000 copies. In Germany, &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; debuted at the top of the charts, remaining there for two weeks and earning a gold certification from BVMI. The album also reached the top of the charts on the European Top 100 Albums chart. &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; also reached the top-ten of the charts in France, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.

== Recognition ==
&quot;Cash Box&quot; editor Kerry Day ranked &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; as the second-best album of 1987. In the &quot;Encyclopedia of World Biography&quot; (1998), authors explained that in this era, unlike the movie, both the soundtrack and its accompanied tour achieved commercial success. In 1989, &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; discussed successful movie soundtracks from 1930s to that point, where &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; was included among the examples, highlighting Madonna&#x27;s participation of four singles. In a report from British Phonographic Industry, according to Nigle Hunter from &quot;Billboard&quot;, the release was called an &quot;easy winner as the most popular original soundtrack album in 1987&quot; on pair with &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot;. Hunter lumped both records among the &quot;new trend for soundtrack albums of mixing new, specially recorded material with older hits&quot;.

<text>A budget crisis is an informal name for a situation in which the legislative and the executive in a presidential system deadlock and are unable to pass a budget. In presidential systems, the legislature has the power to pass a budget, but the executive often has a veto in which there are insufficient votes in the legislature to override. If no emergency provisions are made for the government&#x27;s budget, a budget crisis may develop into a government shutdown in which the government temporarily suspends non-essential services until a budget is passed.

Unlike parliamentary systems, where a loss of supply would trigger the immediate fall of the government, a budget crisis can often lead to an extended stand-off. At the federal level in the United States, a crisis can often be averted by a continuing resolution which appropriates funding at the same level as the previous budget.

A budget crisis can also occur if the legislative branch has a constitutionally mandated dissolution or suspension date and the budget hasn&#x27;t been passed up to that point. The term &quot;budget crisis&quot; could be used for situation where the executive branch freezes certain funds (impoundment) despite the directions of the law on annual budget already passed by parliament.

Politically, a budget crisis may develop in a situation of disagreement between state and civil society. Constitutional economics is a field of economics and constitutionalism which describes and analyzes the specific interrelationships between constitutional issues and functioning of the economy including budget process. The standards of constitutional economics when used during annual budget planning, as well as the latter&#x27;s transparency to the society, are of the primary guiding importance to the implementation of the rule of law. Also, the availability of an effective court system, to be used by the civil society in situations of unfair government spending and executive impoundment of any previously authorized appropriations, becomes a key element for the success of any influential civil society.

==Examples==

===United States federal government shutdown of 1995 and 1996===

A particularly severe budget crisis occurred in the United States in November 1995, when the House of Representatives under Speaker Newt Gingrich and the administration of President Bill Clinton quarrelled over apportionments. The failure of the House and Clinton to pass a continuing budget resolution to apportion temporary funds forced a closure of most non-essential United States government offices for several weeks.

===United States federal government shutdown of 2013===

History repeated for the United States in 2013. It again occurred with a Democratic President, Barack Obama. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives boycotted the budget to protest the Affordable Care Act. The failure of the House to pass a continuing budget resolution forced a closure of most non-essential United States government offices for several weeks in October 2013.

==Uses in popular culture==
In the episode &quot;Shutdown&quot; of &quot;The West Wing&quot;, a budget crisis situation like the 1995-1996 federal government shutdown was depicted when Josiah Bartlet and Republican Speaker of the House Haffley disagree over budget cuts and shuts down the government for a number of days.

<text>Paul Douglas Coverdell (January 20, 1939 – July 18, 2000) was an American politician who served as a United States senator from Georgia from 1993 until his death in 2000. A member of the Republican Party, he previously served as the director of the Peace Corps from 1989 to 1991 under President George H. W. Bush.

==Early life==
Coverdell was born in Des Moines, Iowa in 1939 and lived much of his childhood in the Midwest. Coverdell graduated from Lee&#x27;s Summit High School in Lees Summit, Missouri. and went on to graduate from the University of Missouri in 1961 with a degree in journalism. While in college, Coverdell was a member of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity.

Coverdell joined the Army in 1962 and served as a captain in Okinawa, Taiwan, and Korea. After completing his service Coverdell settled in Atlanta with his wife, Nancy. Coverdell began a career in insurance, founding the firm Coverdell &amp; Co. Inc. with his father and becoming president of the family business in 1965.

==Georgia State Senator (1970–1989)==
Coverdell was unsuccessful in his first attempt to win election to the state senate in 1968 but he ran again and won in 1970 representing north Fulton County. Coverdell began serving as Senate Minority Leader in 1974, a position he held until he left the Georgia Senate in 1989. Coverdell worked with Democrats to accomplish his goals. Roy Barnes, a Democrat who would later be elected Governor of Georgia, said that when he joined the Georgia State Senate, Republican Coverdell took him under his political wing. &quot;He showed that people of different parties could discuss their personal strengths and weaknesses,&quot; Barnes said. &quot;I never worried that Paul would disclose anything I said.&quot; During Coverdell&#x27;s time as minority leader he worked for pension reform, supported DUI legislation, and raising the legal drinking age in Georgia.

In 1977 Coverdell lost a special election for Andrew Young&#x27;s congressional seat to Wyche Fowler. After Coverdell&#x27;s loss in 1977, he began working to develop a base for national Republican candidates and a viable statewide Republican Party organization. In 1985 Coverdell was elected Chairman of the Georgia GOP.

In 1978, Coverdell was vacationing in Maine and decided to look up former chairman of the Republican National Committee George H. W. Bush. Coverdell found Bush&#x27;s address in a phone book, went to his home, knocked on the door and introduced himself to the future president. Bush and Coverdell became close friends and over the next fourteen years Bush and Coverdell would help each other on a number of occasions. In 1980, Coverdell was finance chairman in Georgia when Bush first ran for the Republican nomination for president. In 1988, Coverdell was the Southern steering committee chairman for the Bush campaign. Coverdell&#x27;s efforts paid off in 1988 when Bush carried Georgia&#x27;s twelve electoral votes. When Bush was elected president, Coverdell sent a letter. &quot;If I can help, I&#x27;d like to help,&quot; Coverdell wrote. Bush appointed Coverdell to head the Peace Corps.

==Peace Corps Director (1989–1991)==
Coverdell was sworn in as Director of the Peace Corps on May 2, 1989, in a ceremony in the Oval Office. At the same time Coverdell stepped down from the Georgia State Senate, a post he had held for 15 years and resigned as president of Coverdell and Co. Inc to devote his time to the Peace Corps. Coverdell&#x27;s primary initiative as Peace Corps Director was the creation of the &quot;World Wise Schools&quot; program. The program linked students in the United States with Peace Corps volunteers serving around the world. During the time Coverdell was in office, the World Wise Schools program connected volunteers with 5,000 classrooms in the United States. Coverdell was well regarded among the Peace Corps community. In the fall of 2000, after his death, a tribute was held in his honor at the Peace Corps Headquarters to honor his life and legacy.

===Peace Corps enters Eastern Europe===
Coverdell sent the first Peace Corps volunteers to Eastern Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall. On June 15, 1990, President George H. W. Bush hosted a send off for volunteers headed for Poland and Hungary. &quot;The key you carry with you will be the English language—what Paul calls the language of commerce and understanding. And just as national literacy has long been the key to power, so today English literacy has become the key to progress. Like your liberty, your language came to you as a birthright and a credit to the dreams and sacrifices of those who came before. And today you&#x27;re investing that birthright in the ancient dreams and the new ideas of faraway peoples and their own nations reborn. Your investment is America&#x27;s investment in the consolidation of democracy and independence in Central and Eastern Europe. Peace Corps programs in Poland and Hungary, and then soon in Czechoslovakia, are another tangible element of America&#x27;s sustained commitment to Central and Eastern Europe&#x27;s democratic transformation toward a Europe whole and free.&quot;

===Coverdell&#x27;s support for the Peace Corps===
After Coverdell was elected to the Senate he continued his support for the Peace Corps and supported legislation to expand it. In testimony before the International Relations Committee in the House of Representatives on March 18, 1998, Coverdell testified in support of expansion. &quot;I want to point out that the goal of increasing the number of Peace Corps volunteers spans three Presidencies. Under the distinguished leadership of former Director, the late Director Ruppe, the concept of moving toward 10,000 American volunteers throughout the world began to be articulated by the Reagan Administration. During my directorship we continued the pursuit of expanding the volunteer corps. We were there at a rather unique moment in world history, and the emphasis necessarily began to shift to responding to a host of nations experiencing freedom for the first time in nearly half a century, many more years, and so the emphasis began to move toward the opening, as the chairman alluded to, of new country programs. These new countries can be the beneficiary of our activities if we pursue expanding the volunteer corps.&quot;

===Controversy over trips to Georgia===
Meanwhile, Coverdell had his eye on the Senate seat held by Wyche Fowler, the man who defeated him in the special election for Congress in 1977. The Associated Press reported on September 4, 1991, that Coverdell had resigned as director of the Peace Corps and was considering a run for the Senate. There is some controversy over Coverdell&#x27;s use of the office of Peace Corps Director and his subsequent run for the Senate. The New York Times reported on September 27, 1992, that Coverdell&#x27;s tenure as head of the Peace Corps was likely to be one of the issues in the 1992 Senate race in Georgia and that Coverdell had been &quot;accused of using the office to plot his political future in Georgia.&quot; However, Charlton Heston, who came to Georgia to campaign on Coverdell&#x27;s behalf in the Senate election, wrote for the &quot;National Review&quot; in 1992: &quot;He served (as Peace Corps director) effectively, but it hardly seemed an ideal launching pad for national elective office.&quot; In 2001, the Georgia trips issue returned to the news when some senators proposed renaming the Peace Corps building after Coverdell.

==1992 U.S. Senate election==

In 1992, Coverdell faced an uphill fight to win a U.S. Senate seat and had to campaign in four separate elections (all-candidate primary, primary runoff, all-party general, and general runoff). Coverdell was not a natural campaigner. Senator Phil Gramm, then chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said he was appalled the first time he saw Coverdell speak. &quot;Paul got up and spoke in that squeaky voice and he sort of had a way of jumping up and down when he was speaking and waving his hands,&quot; Gramm said. &quot;But little did I know ... that this man had the heart of a lion.&quot;

Facing four other candidates in the Republican primary, Coverdell failed to win 50% of the vote and was forced into a runoff against Bob Barr that he won by only 1,600 votes. The general election also proved difficult. Democratic incumbent Wyche Fowler beat Coverdell by 30,000 votes on election day, but because the Libertarian candidate, Jim Hudson, had won 3 percent of the vote another runoff election was required. On November 24, Coverdell won the runoff by slightly over 16,000 votes, aided by an endorsement from Hudson, who was no longer in the race; he became only the second Republican Georgia sent to the Senate since Reconstruction. President Bush showed his support for Coverdell and Barbara Bush campaigned for Coverdell during the Senate race.

Coverdell was also aided by a memorable ad campaign, highlighted by the &quot;Jingle&quot; television and radio spots featuring a ditty written and sung by senior citizen Margie Lopp.

==United States Senator (1993–2000)==

===Service in the Senate===
Coverdell served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Agriculture Committee, and Small Business Committee. After the death of Senator John Chafee on October 24, 1999, a seat opened up on the Senate Finance Committee and Coverdell relinquished his seat on the Foreign Relations Committee to fill the seat. Coverdell sponsored legislation used by millions of Americans to fund college educations for their children originally called Education IRAs but now known as Coverdell Education Savings Accounts (CESAs) or Coverdell Plans for short. Coverdell ESAs allow money to grow tax deferred and proceeds to be withdrawn tax free for qualified education expenses at a qualified institution.

Coverdell sponsored the Volunteer Protection Act, a complex law that, in general, protects volunteers who serve nonprofit organizations and governmental entities from legal liability for tort claims based on simple negligence, provided that certain conditions are met. However critics of the law say that providing immunity to a volunteer who has injured someone as a consequence of his carelessness clashes with the charitable goal of helping others, that nonprofits should be held to the same standard of care as for-profit organizations, and that the Act would not be necessary at all if nonprofits carried adequate general liability insurance. Coverdell also worked against tax increases, to protect federal lands in national parks, and for humanitarian concerns.

In 1998, Coverdell, running with the slogan &quot;Coverdell Works,&quot; made history by becoming the first Republican from Georgia ever to be re-elected to the U.S. Senate. In 1999 before an exploratory committee was formed, Coverdell took on the job of liaison between then Governor George W. Bush&#x27;s campaign and the Senate. Early in the campaign, Coverdell&#x27;s job was to line up Republican senators to endorse Governor Bush instead of Senator John McCain and he succeeded in getting the endorsement of almost every Senate Republican. After Bush locked up the nomination, Coverdell dealt with requests from senators who wanted to talk to Bush. &quot;We don&#x27;t want black holes,&quot; Coverdell said. &quot;We want people feeling they are part of the effort. We want to create good will.&quot;

===Death===
On a trip to Georgia for a weekend of speaking engagements and constituency services, Coverdell complained of a severe headache. Diagnosed with a cerebral hemorrhage, Coverdell underwent surgery at Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta on July 17, 2000. He never regained consciousness and died early in the evening of July 18, 2000.

More than 50 senators and representatives from both parties joined 900 other mourners at Coverdell&#x27;s funeral at the Peachtree United Methodist Church in Atlanta. Texas governor George W. Bush took time from the 2000 presidential campaign to attend the services with his wife Laura. President Clinton also released a statement expressing his condolences to the Coverdell family. Former president George H. W. Bush, a close friend of Coverdell, did not attend, but a family friend read his tribute. Bush wrote:
==Legacy and honors==
Coverdell was often described as a quiet, soft-spoken man, but he left profound marks on the governments of both the state of Georgia and the nation in a relatively brief period of time through the Coverdell Education Savings Accounts, which are used by millions of Americans to fund college educations for their children, and the establishment of a strong Republican Party in Georgia.

Coverdell left a legacy of civility in government. Political columnist David Broder wrote that Coverdell&#x27;s &quot;name rarely appeared in the headlines, and his face was not seen on magazine covers or the Sunday TV shows&quot; but that he was admired and cherished by his colleagues. Democratic senator Dianne Feinstein remembered that &quot;(Coverdell) was not only a good senator, he was a good and decent man ... a very nice man.&quot; Senator Olympia Snowe said &quot;People like Paul Coverdell exist in the world — good, honorable, trustworthy people who call us to our better nature.&quot; George H. W. Bush honored Coverdell at the inauguration of the University of Georgia&#x27;s Coverdell Center for Biomedical and Health Sciences on April 6, 2006: &quot;In the Washington world of bitter partisanship, Paul was the voice of reason.&quot;

George W. Bush said: 

Coverdell&#x27;s state Senate papers are held by Georgia State University, while his papers from the Peace Corps and United States Senate are housed at the Ina Dillard Russell Library of Georgia College &amp; State University in Milledgeville, which also has a public policy institute named in his honor.

The Peace Corps&#x27; headquarters in Washington, D.C., was named for Coverdell. The World Wise School program that he started was rebranded with his name in his honor as well as the renaming of the Fellows/USA program, a graduate school benefit program for returned Peace Corps Volunteers, to bear his name. He was an esteemed Director of the agency and many programs were rebranded to bear his name in recognition of the work he provided to create them.

Coverdell was also honored by the Georgia General Assembly in 2005 with a resolution to rename the Legislative Office Building the &quot;Paul Coverdell Legislative Office Building.&quot; The move came under some criticism as, ironically, Paul Coverdell had opposed the funding for the building while he was serving in the Georgia Senate.

Coverdell was survived by his wife Nancy, who later became a presidential elector in 2000 on the Bush-Cheney ticket.

<doc id="335085" wikidata="Q969757" url="?curid=335085" title="John Breaux">
<text>John Berlinger Breaux (; born March 1, 1944) is an American lobbyist, attorney, and retired politician from Louisiana. He served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1972 to 1987 and as a United States Senator from 1987 to 2005. A Southern Democrat, he was considered one of the more conservative national legislators from the Democratic Party. Breaux was a member of the New Democrat Coalition.

After his congressional tenure, he became a lobbyist, co-founding the Breaux-Lott Leadership Group. The firm was later acquired by law and lobbying firm Patton Boggs, now Squire Patton Boggs.

== Early life and career ==
Breaux was born in Crowley, Louisiana, on March 1, 1944. He graduated from the University of Southwestern Louisiana (now called the University of Louisiana at Lafayette) in Lafayette in 1964 and from Louisiana State University Law School in Baton Rouge in 1967. After graduation, he practiced law, and then served as an assistant to U.S. Representative Edwin Edwards. He was also a member of Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity.

==Congressional career==

Breaux was elected as a Democrat to the 92nd United States Congress in a special election on September 30, 1972, to fill the vacancy created by Edwards&#x27; resignation in order to become governor. Breaux&#x27;s campaign manager was Ron Faucheux, later a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives. At the age of twenty-eight, Breaux was the youngest member of the U.S. House of Representatives. Breaux was re-elected with ease to the seven succeeding Congresses and served until January 3, 1987.
He was not a candidate for re-election to the House of Representatives in 1986, but was instead elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate.

Breaux opposed Ronald Reagan&#x27;s nomination of Robert Bork to the U.S. Supreme Court. On October 23, 1987, he voted with all but two Democrats, and six Republicans to defeat his nomination by a vote of 42-58.

On October 15, 1991, Breaux was one of seven Southern Democrats who voted to confirm the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court in a 52 to 48 vote, the narrowest margin of approval in more than a century.

Breaux was seen as a centrist in a Senate divided along partisan lines, and was frequently sought out by Republican leaders to corral a few Democratic votes when they needed them; conversely he also often served as the Democratic emissary in attempts to gather a few moderate Republicans to win votes on their proposals. He was pro-life and a supporter of Second Amendment rights, though he gradually moderated his position on gun control. He was more conservative on taxes than most in his party and challenged many environmental protections. He voted in favor of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), welfare reform, the balanced budget amendment, and tighter bankruptcy laws. He was a key Democratic supporter of Republican attempts to abolish the estate tax and in 2001 was among the minority of Democrats to support Bush&#x27;s tax cut and opposed virtually all attempts by Democrats to alter it. However Breaux had voted with the majority of Democrats in favor of the 1993 Budget. In 2003 he submitted an amendment to reduce the tax cut to $350 billion. In 1995 he notably voted twice with more liberal elements of his party against the widely approved lawsuit reform measures, the Common Sense Product Liability and Legal Reform Act and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Both acts were vetoed by President Bill Clinton, although the second act was passed over his veto.

On June 22, 2004, Breaux cast the lone vote against amendment, S.A. 3464, which would increase the maximum fine from $27,500 to $275,000 when the FCC determines a broadcaster is guilty of &quot;obscene, indecent or profane language.&quot; Breaux also opposed the loosening of FCC rules that would allow cross-media platforms in the same community to fall under a single owner.

In 1993, Breaux was elected by Senate Democrats as Deputy Majority Whip, a position he held until his retirement. He also held a number of key Senate committee positions. A senior member of the Finance Committee, Senator Breaux served as the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Social Security and Family Policy. From his position on the Finance Committee, he helped build the coalition that passed welfare reform and health insurance reform bills in 1996. He also pushed for a reduction in the capital gains tax and for tax relief for college education expenses. In 1998, Breaux was selected by the White House and House and Senate leaders to chair the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare. Also in 1998, Senator Breaux co-chaired the National Commission on Retirement Policy, which produced legislation to help reform Social Security.

Breaux was the principal architect of the $400 billion Medicare Prescription Drug Modernization Act.

Breaux was a founder of the bipartisan Senate Centrist Coalition and served as chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council.

Breaux&#x27;s state director and press secretary was the journalist Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Mann, who holds the
Douglas Manship Chair of Journalism at Louisiana State University.

In the 2003 Louisiana gubernatorial campaign, after flirting briefly with the possibility of running himself, Breaux campaigned hard for the successful Democratic candidate, Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Lafayette. That same year, Breaux was inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield.

He announced that he would not run for re-election in 2004; by most accounts he was so popular that it was believed he would have easily won a fourth term had he chosen to run again. He was succeeded in the Senate by Republican David Vitter of suburban New Orleans. Despite Breaux&#x27;s popularity, he was unable to dictate his successor in the Senate, as Russell Long and J. Bennett Johnston, Jr. had done. He endorsed Democrat Chris John, the U.S. representative from the seventh district, which Breaux had once represented. However, John came second in the jungle primary to Republican David Vitter. Vitter won 51% of the vote, which allowed him to avoid a runoff election.

==Post-congressional career==

In February 2005, Breaux took a position as Distinguished Professor in the Douglas Manship School of Mass Communication at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. Since 2005, Breaux has been a lobbyist for Washington, DC, firm Squire Patton Boggs, specializing in issues of health care and energy law.

Since leaving office, Breaux has spearheaded his own national campaign, &quot;Ceasefire on Health Care: Finding Common Ground for the Uninsured.&quot; Breaux coined the campaign name as a play on the CNN TV program &quot;Crossfire&quot;, which he points out has been canceled. Breaux has hosted multiple events with prominent members of both parties to establish a dialogue that will lead to real healthcare reform. Breaux developed the campaign alongside American University&#x27;s Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies.

Beginning in February 2007, there was much speculation among Louisiana political commentators as to whether Breaux would announce his candidacy in the 2007 Louisiana governors&#x27; race. Breaux, arguably the most popular Democratic politician in Louisiana, was considering entering the race, if Blanco would be willing to step aside for Breaux. On March 20, 2007, Blanco announced that she would not run for re-election as governor. On March 29, 2007, John Breaux made his first Louisiana public appearance since speculation began concerning his potential candidacy. Breaux said that he intended to run, and would announce his candidacy as soon as Louisiana Attorney General Charles Foti, a Democrat, gave a formal legal opinion on whether Breaux was eligible to run. It was alleged that he would not meet the residency requirements to run for governor as he is registered to vote, and has listed his primary address in Maryland since 2005. At issue was the clause in the Louisiana constitution that states that a candidate for governor must be a &#x27;citizen&#x27; of the State of Louisiana; what constitutes a citizen is not defined.

On April 13, 2007, Breaux released a statement that he would not be running for governor. Attorney-General Foti had declined to issue an opinion on Breaux&#x27;s eligibility, stating it was an issue for the courts to decide. Breaux stated that he did not want the issue of eligibility to overshadow his campaign, as a court challenge would not occur until September.

Breaux also serves on the board of directors for CSX Transportation.

In 2021, Breaux was involved in efforts to lobby against taxation of large inheritances.

In Acadiana, and in honor of the legacy Breaux has left behind, a local Japanese restaurant chain named a sushi roll after him, the John Breaux, with crawfish and avocado.

<text>The following is a list of the lieutenant governors of New Brunswick. Though the present day office of the lieutenant governor in New Brunswick came into being only upon the province&#x27;s entry into Canadian Confederation in 1867, the post is a continuation from the first governorship of New Brunswick in 1786. This list also includes a number of the individuals, primarily Chief Justices, who acted briefly as de facto interim lieutenant governors for short periods of time. For instance, when lieutenant governors died in office. These individuals were generally not sworn in as actual lieutenant governors, they merely temporarily assumed the responsibilities of the Lieutenant Governor until a new person was appointed to the position. These &quot;interim&quot; lieutenant governors are identified in the list below as &quot;admin&quot;.

<doc id="335087" wikidata="Q5176488" url="?curid=335087" title="Council of Relief Agencies Licensed to Operate in Germany">
<text>The Council of Relief Agencies Licensed to Operate in Germany (CRALOG) was a nongovernmental organization created in 1946 by the American Council of Voluntary Agencies for Foreign Service and included 11 major relief agencies such as the International Red Cross.

Food relief shipments to Germany had been prohibited by the U.S. until December 1945, since &quot;they might tend to negate the policy of restricting the German standard of living to the average of the surrounding European nations&quot;.

CRALOG was created after the American Council had dispatched a survey team to occupied Germany, which had reported back on the situation in February 1946. CRALOG was then on February 19, 1946, established and designated by the Truman administration in a directive on relief contributions to Germany as the only medium through which aid to the U.S. occupation zone could be channeled.

The survey team had been permitted to visit Germany only after President Truman had been subjected to increased pressure both by the American Congress and public. In January 1946 34 U.S. senators had petitioned that private relief organizations be allowed to help Germany and Austria, stating that the desperate food situation in occupied Germany &quot;presents a picture of such frightful horror as to stagger the imagination, evidence which increasingly marks the United States as an accomplice in a terrible crime against humanity.&quot;

The Governors of the Western Allied Occupation Zones in Germany signed contracts permitting CRALOG to provide relief in their respective zones as follows: General Lucius D. Clay, military governor of the U.S. occupation zone signed on January 29, 1946, the UK governor signed on July 12, 1946, and the French on July 30, 1946. The Allied Kommandatura that jointly ruled Berlin signed in April 1947.

A relief worker described the situation encountered in Germany in 1946 as follows:

The first CRALOG shipment arrived in Bremen harbor in April 1946, and by the termination of the program in 1962, it had dispatched 300,000 tons of aid to Germany.

<doc id="335094" wikidata="Q7306351" url="?curid=335094" title="Reducing atmosphere">
<text>A reducing atmosphere is an atmosphere in which oxidation is prevented by absence of oxygen and other oxidizing gases or vapours, and which may contain actively reductant gases such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane and hydrogen sulfide that would be readily oxidized to remove any free oxygen. Although Early Earth had a reducing prebiotic atmosphere prior to the Proterozoic eon, starting at about 2.5 billion years ago in the late Neoarchaean period, the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere experienced a significant rise in oxygen and transitioned to an oxidizing atmosphere with a surplus of molecular oxygen (dioxygen, O2) as the primary oxidizing agent.

==Foundry operations==
The principal mission of an iron foundry is the conversion of iron oxides (purified iron ores) to iron metal. This reduction is usually effected using a reducing atmosphere consisting of some mixture of natural gas, hydrogen (H2), and carbon monoxide. The byproduct is carbon dioxide.

==Metal processing==
In metal processing, a reducing atmosphere is used in annealing ovens for relaxation of metal stresses without corroding the metal. A non-oxidizing gas, usually nitrogen or argon, is typically used as a carrier gas so that diluted amounts of reducing gases may be used. Typically, this is achieved through using the combustion products of fuels and tailoring the ratio of CO:CO2. However, other common reducing atmospheres in the metal processing industries consist of dissociated ammonia, vacuum, and direct mixing of appropriately pure gases of N2, Ar, and H2.

A reducing atmosphere is also used to produce specific effects on ceramic wares being fired. A reduction atmosphere is produced in a fuel fired kiln by reducing the draft and depriving the kiln of oxygen. This diminished level of oxygen causes incomplete combustion of the fuel and raises the level of carbon inside the kiln. At high temperatures the carbon will bond with and remove the oxygen in the metal oxides used as colorants in the glazes. This loss of oxygen results in a change in the color of the glazes because it allows the metals in the glaze to be seen in an unoxidized form. A reduction atmosphere can also affect the color of the clay body. If iron is present in the clay body, as it is in most stoneware, then it will be affected by the reduction atmosphere as well.

In most commercial incinerators, exactly the same conditions are created to encourage the release of carbon-bearing fumes. These fumes are then oxidized in reburn tunnels where oxygen is injected progressively. The exothermic oxidation reaction maintains the temperature of the reburn tunnels. This system allows lower temperatures to be employed in the incinerator section, where the solids are volumetrically reduced.

==Origin of life==

The atmosphere of Early Earth is widely speculated to have been reducing. The Miller–Urey experiment, related to some hypotheses for the origin of life, entailed reactions in a reducing atmosphere composed of a mixed atmosphere of methane, ammonia and hydrogen sulfide. Some hypotheses for the origin of life invoke a reducing atmosphere consisting of hydrogen cyanide (HCN). Experiments show that HCN can polymerize in the presence of ammonia to give various products including amino acids. The same principle applies to Mars, Venus and Titan.

Cyanobacteria are suspected to be the first photoautotrophs that evolved oxygenic photosynthesis, which over the latter half of the Archaen eon eventually depleted all reductants in the Earth&#x27;s oceans, terrestrial surface and atmosphere, gradually increasing the oxygen concentration in the atmosphere, changing it to what is known as an oxidizing atmosphere. This rising oxygen initially led to a 300 million-year-long ice age that devastated the then-mostly anaerobe-dominated biosphere, forcing the surviving anaerobic colonies to evolve into symbiotic microbial mats with the newly evolved aerobes. Some aerobic bacteria eventually became endosymbiont within other anaerobes (likely archaea), and the resultant symbiogenesis led to the evolution of an entirely new lineage of life — the eukaryotes, who took advantage of mitochondrial aerobic respiration to power their cellular activities, allowing life to thrive and evolve into ever more complex forms. The increased oxygen in the atmosphere also eventually created the ozone layer, which shielded away harmful ionizing ultraviolet radiation that otherwise would have photodissociated away surface water and rendered life impossible on land and the ocean surface.

In contrast to the hypothesized early reducing atmosphere, evidence exists that Hadean atmospheric oxygen levels were similar to today&#x27;s. These results suggest prebiotic building blocks were delivered from elsewhere in the galaxy. The results, however, do not contradict existing theories on life&#x27;s journey from anaerobic to aerobic organisms. The results quantify the nature of gas molecules containing carbon, hydrogen, and sulphur in the earliest atmosphere, but they shed no light on the much later rise of free oxygen in the air.

<text>Ma&#x27;alul () was a Palestinian village, with a mixed population of primarily Muslims with a substantial minority of Palestinian Christians, that was depopulated and destroyed by Israel during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. Located six kilometers west of the city of Nazareth, many of its inhabitants became internally displaced refugees, after taking refuge in Nazareth and the neighbouring town of Yafa an-Naseriyye. Despite having never left the territory that came to form part of Israel, the majority of the villagers of Maalul, and other Palestinian villages like Andor and Al-Mujidal, were declared &quot;absentees&quot;, allowing the confiscation of their land under the Absentees Property Law.

Today, much of the former village&#x27;s lands are owned by the Jewish National Fund. All that remains of its former structures are two churches, a mosque and a Roman-era mausoleum, known locally as &quot;Qasr al-Dayr&quot; (&quot;Castle of the monastery&quot;).

==History==
In 1850, Rabbi Joseph Schwartz identified Ma&#x27;alul with the Biblical town of Nahalal.

===Ottoman era===
Incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517, &quot; Ma&#x27;alul&quot; appeared in the census of 1596, located in the &quot;nahiya&quot; (&quot;subdistrict&quot;) of Tiberias under the &quot;liwa&#x27;&quot; (&quot;district&quot;) of Safad with a population of seventy-seven. It paid taxes on a number of crops, including wheat and barley, as well as goats and beehives. 

Ma&#x27;alul, and the neighbouring towns and villages of Nazareth, Mejdal, Yafa, Jebatha and Kneffis paid taxes to the monks of Nazareth, who bought the right to collect these taxes from the Ottoman authorities in 1777 for two hundred dollars. Thirty years later, they again purchased this right, though this time for two thousands five hundred dollars, owing to the rise in the price of cereals and ground rents. Pierre Jacotin called the village &quot;Matoun&quot; on his map from 1799.

In 1859 the population was estimated to be 280, who cultivated 42 faddans of land. In 1875 Victor Guérin found Ma&#x27;alul to have 350 inhabitants; all Muslim except about 30 &quot;Schismatic Greeks.&quot;

By the late nineteenth century, the village was made of adobe bricks, built on a hill, Just outside the village was a magnificent Roman mausoleum, called Qasr al-Dayr.

A population list from about 1887 showed that &quot;Ma&#x27;lul&quot; had about 650 inhabitants; all Muslims.

===British Mandate era===

At the beginning of the twentieth century, the people of Ma&#x27;alul were tenants of the Sursuq family of Beirut, absentee landlords who had acquired the village lands earlier. In 1921 the Sursuqs sold all but 2,000 dunams of Ma&#x27;alul&#x27;s land to the Zionist Palestine Land Development Company. Zionist pioneers founded the moshav of Nahalal on that land the same year. The remaining 2,000 dunums were insufficient to support the village&#x27;s population, so at the request of the Mandate government, the company agreed to lease an additional 3,000 dunams to the villagers until 1927. The villagers had the option to buy this land before the lease expired.

According to the British Mandate&#x27;s 1922 census of Palestine, &quot;Ma&#x27;alul&quot; had 436 inhabitants; 186 Muslims and 250 Christians, where all the Christians were Orthodox. By the 1931 census the population had decreased to 390; 228 Muslims, and 162 Christians, in a total of 90 houses.

In the 1945 statistics the population of Ma&#x27;alul was 690; 490 Muslims and 200 Christians, with a total of 4,698 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey. Of this, a total of 650 dunams were for plantations and irrigable land, 3,462 for cereals, while 29 dunams were built-up land.

===1948, and aftermath===
The village was captured by the Israeli army on 15 July 1948 during Operation Dekel. The villagers were forced to leave and the houses destroyed.

In 1949 an Israeli military base was built on village land.

Walid Khalidi describes the remains of Ma&#x27;alul in 1992:
The village site is now covered with a pine forest planted by the Jewish National Fund and dedicated to the memory of prominent Jews and some non-Jewish Americans and Europeans. A military base is also on the site. The mosque and two churches still stand, and are used intermittently as cow sheds by the residents of Kibbutz Kefar ha-Choresh. Overlooking Wadi al-Halabi, between the village site and the site of al-Mujaydil, is an Israeli plastics factory. Cactus, olive trees, and fig trees grow on the site, which is strewn with piles of stones. A few tombs in the Muslim cemetery across from the mosque can be seen. The main village site also contains the remains of houses.

Ma&#x27;alul was the object of the 1985 documentary film by Michel Khleifi; &quot;Ma&#x27;loul Celebrates its Destruction&quot;.

<text>The jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus) is a species of tree in the fig, mulberry, and breadfruit family (Moraceae). The jackfruit is the largest tree fruit, reaching as much as in weight, in length, and in diameter. A mature jackfruit tree produces some 200 fruits per year, with older trees bearing up to 500 fruits in a year. The jackfruit is a multiple fruit composed of hundreds to thousands of individual flowers, and the fleshy petals of the unripe fruit are eaten.

The jackfruit tree is well-suited to tropical lowlands and is widely cultivated throughout tropical regions of the world, including India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and the rainforests of the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Australia. 

The ripe fruit is sweet (depending on variety) and is commonly used in desserts. Canned green jackfruit has a mild taste and meat-like texture that lends itself to being called &quot;vegetable meat&quot;. Jackfruit is commonly used in South and Southeast Asian cuisines. Both ripe and unripe fruits are consumed. It is available internationally, canned or frozen, and in chilled meals, as are various products derived from the fruit, such as noodles and chips.

==Names==
The word &quot;jackfruit&quot; comes from Portuguese , which in turn is derived from the Malayalam language term (ചക്ക), when the Portuguese arrived in India at Kozhikode (Calicut) on the Malabar Coast (Kerala) in 1499. Later the Malayalam name () was recorded by Hendrik van Rheede (1678–1703) in the , vol. iii in Latin. Henry Yule translated the book in Jordanus Catalani&#x27;s () &quot;Mirabilia descripta: the wonders of the East&quot;. This term is in turn derived from the Proto-Dravidian root (&quot;fruit, vegetable&quot;).

The common English name &quot;jackfruit&quot; was used by physician and naturalist Garcia de Orta in his 1563 book . Centuries later, botanist Ralph Randles Stewart suggested it was named after William Jack (1795–1822), a Scottish botanist who worked for the East India Company in Bengal, Sumatra, and Malaya.

&quot;Nangka&quot; is another name used in Philippine English borrowing from Tagalog related to in Cebuano and in Malay, both from the same Austronesian language family.

==Description==
=== Shape, trunk and leaves ===
&quot;Artocarpus heterophyllus&quot; grows as an evergreen tree that has a relatively short trunk and dense treetop. It easily reaches heights of and trunk diameters of . It sometimes forms buttress roots. The bark of the jackfruit tree is reddish-brown and smooth. In the event of injury to the bark, a milky sap is released.

The leaves are alternate and spirally arranged. They are gummy and thick and are divided into a petiole and a leaf blade. The petiole is long. The leathery leaf blade is long and wide, and is oblong to ovate in shape.

In young trees, the leaf edges are irregularly lobed or split. On older trees, the leaves are rounded and dark green, with a smooth leaf margin. The leaf blade has a prominent main nerve and, starting on each side, six to eight lateral nerves. The stipules are egg-shaped at a length of .

=== Flowers ===
The inflorescences are formed on the trunk, branches or twigs (cauliflory). Jackfruit trees are monoecious, having both female and male flowers on a tree. The inflorescences are pedunculated, cylindrical to ellipsoidal or pear-shaped, to about long and wide. Inflorescences are initially completely enveloped in egg-shaped cover sheets which rapidly slough off.

The flowers are small, sitting on a fleshy rachis. The male flowers are greenish, some flowers are sterile. The male flowers are hairy and the perianth ends with two membrane. The individual and prominent stamens are straight with yellow, roundish anthers. Pollen grains are tiny, around 60 microns in diameter. After the pollen distribution, the stamens become ash-gray and fall off after a few days. Later, all the male inflorescences also fall off. The greenish female flowers, with hairy and tubular perianth, have a fleshy flower-like base. The female flowers contain an ovary with a broad, capitate, or rarely bilobed scar. The blooming time ranges from December until February or March.

===Fruit===
The ellipsoidal to roundish fruit is a multiple fruit formed from the fusion of the ovaries of multiple flowers. The fruits grow on a long and thick stem on the trunk. They vary in size and ripen from an initially yellowish-greenish to yellow, and then at maturity to yellowish-brown. They possess a hard, gummy shell with small pimples surrounded with hard, hexagonal tubercles. The large and variously shaped fruit have a length of and a diameter of and can weigh up to the largest of all tree-borne fruits.

The fruits consist of a fibrous, whitish core (rachis) about thick. Radiating from this are many individual fruits, long. They are elliptical to egg-shaped, light brownish achenes with a length of about and a diameter of .

There may be about 100–500 seeds per fruit. The seed coat consists of a thin, waxy, parchment-like and easily removable testa (husk) and a brownish, membranous tegmen. The cotyledons are usually unequal in size, and the endosperm is minimally present. An average fruit consists of 27% edible seed coat, 15% edible seeds, 20% white pulp (undeveloped perianth, rags) and bark and 10% core.

The fruit matures during the rainy season from July to August. The bean-shaped achenes of the jackfruit are coated with a firm yellowish aril (seed coat, flesh), which has an intense sweet taste at maturity of the fruit. The pulp is enveloped by many narrow strands of fiber (undeveloped perianth), which run between the hard shell and the core of the fruit and are firmly attached to it. When pruned, the inner part (core) secretes a sticky, milky liquid, which is hard to remove from the skin, even with soap and water. To clean the hands after &quot;unwinding&quot; the pulp an oil or other solvent is used. For example, street vendors in Tanzania, who sell the fruit in small segments, provide small bowls of kerosene for their customers to cleanse their sticky fingers. When fully ripe, jackfruit has a strong pleasant aroma, the pulp of the opened fruit resembles the odor of pineapple and banana.

Jackfruit has a distinctive sweet and fruity aroma. In a study of flavour volatiles in five jackfruit cultivars, the main volatile compounds detected were ethyl isovalerate, propyl isovalerate, butyl isovalerate, isobutyl isovalerate, 3-methylbutyl acetate, 1-butanol, and 2-methylbutan-1-ol. A fully ripe and unopened jackfruit is known to &quot;emit a strong aroma&quot; – perhaps unpleasant – with the inside of the fruit described as smelling of pineapple and banana. 

== Ecology ==
The species has expanded excessively because its fruits, which naturally fall to the ground and open, are eagerly eaten by small mammals, such as the common marmoset and coati. The seeds are then dispersed by these animals, spreading jackfruit trees that compete for space with native tree species. The supply of jackfruit has allowed the marmoset and coati populations to expand. Since both prey opportunistically on bird eggs and nestlings, the increases in marmoset and coati populations are detrimental to local birds.

=== As an invasive species ===
In Brazil, the jackfruit can become an invasive species as in Brazil&#x27;s Tijuca Forest National Park in Rio de Janeiro or at the Horto Florestal in neighbouring Niterói. The Tijuca is mostly an artificial secondary forest, whose planting began during the mid-nineteenth century; jackfruit trees have been a part of the park&#x27;s flora since it was founded.

== Cultivation ==
=== History ===
The jackfruit was domesticated independently in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, as indicated by the Southeast Asian names which are not derived from the Sanskrit roots. It was probably first domesticated by Austronesians in Java or the Malay Peninsula. The fruit was later introduced to Guam via Filipino settlers when both were part of the Spanish Empire.

=== Care ===
In terms of taking care of the plant, minimal pruning is required; cutting off dead branches from the interior of the tree is only sometimes needed. In addition, twigs bearing fruit must be twisted or cut down to the trunk to induce growth for the next season. Branches should be pruned every three to four years to maintain productivity.

Some trees carry too many mediocre fruits and these are usually removed to allow the others to develop better to maturity.

Stingless bees such as &quot;Tetragonula iridipennis&quot; are jackfruit pollinators, and so play an important role in jackfruit cultivation. It seems to be the case that pollination results from a three-way mutualism involving the flower, a fungus, and a species of gall midge, &quot;Clinidiplosis ultracrepidata&quot;. The fungus forms a film over the syncarps which is a food source to both the fly larvae and adults.

===Production and marketing===
In 2017, India produced of jackfruit, followed by Bangladesh, Thailand, and Indonesia.

The marketing of jackfruit involves three groups: producers, traders, and middlemen, including wholesalers and retailers. The marketing channels are rather complex. Large farms sell immature fruit to wholesalers, which helps cash flow and reduces risk, whereas medium-sized farms sell the fruit directly to local markets or retailers.

===Commercial availability===
Outside countries of origin, fresh jackfruit can be found at food markets throughout Southeast Asia. It is also extensively cultivated in the Brazilian coastal region, where it is sold in local markets. It is available canned in sugary syrup, or frozen, already prepared and cut. Jackfruit industries are established in Sri Lanka and Vietnam, where the fruit is processed into products such as flour, noodles, &quot;papad&quot;, and ice cream. It is also canned and sold as a vegetable for export.

Jackfruit is also widely available year-round, both canned and dried. Dried jackfruit chips are produced by various manufacturers. As reported in 2019, jackfruit became more widely available in US grocery stores, cleaned and ready to cook, as well as in premade dishes or prepared ingredients. It is on restaurant menus in preparations such as taco fillings and vegan versions of pulled pork dishes.

==Uses==

=== Nutrition ===

The edible raw pulp is 74% water, 23% carbohydrates, 2% protein, and 1% fat. The carbohydrate component is primarily sugars, and is a source of dietary fiber (table). In a reference amount of , raw jackfruit provides 95 calories, and is a moderate source (10–19% of the Daily Value) of vitamin B6, vitamin C, and potassium, with no significant content of other micronutrients (table).

The jackfruit is a partial solution for food security in developing countries.

=== Culinary uses ===
Ripe jackfruit is naturally sweet, with subtle pineapple- or banana-like flavor. It can be used to make a variety of dishes, including custards, cakes, or mixed with shaved ice as &quot;es teler&quot; in Indonesia or &quot;halo-halo&quot; in the Philippines. For the traditional breakfast dish in southern India, &quot;idlis&quot;, the fruit is used with rice as an ingredient and jackfruit leaves are used as a wrapping for steaming. Jackfruit &quot;dosas&quot; can be prepared by grinding jackfruit flesh along with the batter. Ripe jackfruit arils are sometimes seeded, fried, or freeze-dried and sold as jackfruit chips.

The seeds from ripe fruits are edible once cooked, and have a milky, sweet taste often compared to Brazil nuts. They may be boiled, baked, or roasted. When roasted, the flavor of the seeds is comparable to chestnuts. Seeds are used as snacks (either by boiling or fire-roasting) or to make desserts. In Java, the seeds are commonly cooked and seasoned with salt as a snack. They are commonly used in curry in India in the form of a traditional lentil and vegetable mix curry. Young leaves are tender enough to be used as a vegetable.

The flavor of the ripe fruit is comparable to a combination of apple, pineapple, mango, and banana. Varieties are distinguished according to characteristics of the fruit flesh. In Indochina, the two varieties are the &quot;hard&quot; version (crunchier, drier, and less sweet, but fleshier), and the &quot;soft&quot; version (softer, moister, and much sweeter, with a darker gold-color flesh than the hard variety). Unripe jackfruit has a mild flavor and meat-like texture and is used in curry dishes with spices in many cuisines. The skin of unripe jackfruit must be peeled first, then the remaining jackfruit flesh is chopped into edible portions and cooked before serving. The final chunks resemble prepared artichoke hearts in their mild taste, color, and flowery qualities.

The cuisines of many Asian countries use cooked young jackfruit. In many cultures, jackfruit is boiled and used in curries as a staple food. The boiled young jackfruit is used in salads or as a vegetable in spicy curries and side dishes, and as fillings for cutlets and chops. It may be used by vegetarians as a substitute for meat such as pulled pork, though the protein content of the fruit is not significant. It may be cooked with coconut milk and eaten alone or with meat, shrimp or smoked pork. In southern India, unripe jackfruit slices are deep-fried to make chips. The jackfruit seeds are also boiled and used in sambar (stew).

After roasting, the seeds may be used as a commercial alternative to chocolate aroma.

==== South Asia ====
In Bangladesh, the fruit is consumed on its own. The unripe fruit is used in curry, and the seed is often dried and preserved to be later used in curry. In India, two varieties of jackfruit predominate: &quot;muttomvarikka&quot; and &quot;sindoor&quot;. &quot;Muttomvarikka&quot; has a slightly hard inner flesh when ripe, while the inner flesh of the ripe &quot;sindoor&quot; fruit is soft. In Sri Lanka these two varieties are called &quot;waraka&quot; and &quot;wela&quot; respectively.

A sweet preparation called &quot;chakkavaratti&quot; (jackfruit jam) is made by seasoning pieces of &quot;muttomvarikka&quot; fruit flesh in jaggery, which can be preserved and used for many months. The fruits are either eaten alone or as a side to rice. The juice is extracted and either drunk straight or as a side. The juice is sometimes condensed and eaten as candies. The seeds are either boiled or roasted and eaten with salt and hot chilies. They are also used to make spicy side dishes with rice. Jackfruit may be ground and made into a paste, then spread over a mat and allowed to dry in the sun to create a natural chewy candy.

==== Southeast Asia ====

In Indonesia and Malaysia, jackfruit is called &quot;nangka&quot;. The ripe fruit is usually sold separately and consumed on its own, or sliced and mixed with shaved ice as a sweet concoction dessert such as &quot;es campur&quot; and &quot;es teler&quot;. The ripe fruit might be dried and fried as &quot;kripik nangka&quot;, or jackfruit cracker. The seeds are boiled and consumed with salt, as they contain edible starchy content; this is called &quot;beton&quot;. Young (unripe) jackfruit is made into curry called &quot;gulai nangka&quot; or stewed called &quot;gudeg&quot;.

In the Philippines, unripe jackfruit or &quot;langka&quot; is usually cooked in coconut milk and eaten with rice; this is called &quot;ginataang langka&quot;. The ripe fruit is often an ingredient in local desserts such as &quot;halo-halo&quot; and the Filipino turon. The ripe fruit, besides also being eaten raw as it is, is also preserved by storing in syrup or by drying. The seeds are also boiled before being eaten.

Thailand is a major producer of jackfruit, which are often cut, prepared, and canned in a sugary syrup (or frozen in bags or boxes without syrup) and exported overseas, frequently to North America and Europe.

In Vietnam, jackfruit is used to make jackfruit &quot;chè&quot;, a sweet dessert soup, similar to the Chinese derivative &quot;bubur cha cha&quot;. The Vietnamese also use jackfruit purée as part of pastry fillings or as a topping on &quot;xôi ngọt&quot; (a sweet version of sticky rice portions).

Jackfruits are found primarily in the eastern part of Taiwan. The fresh fruit can be eaten directly or preserved as dried fruit, candied fruit, or jam. It is also stir-fried or stewed with other vegetables and meat.

==== Americas ====
In Brazil, three varieties are recognized: &quot;jaca-dura&quot;, or the &quot;hard&quot; variety, which has a firm flesh, and the largest fruits that can weigh between 15 and 40 kg each; &quot;jaca-mole&quot;, or the &quot;soft&quot; variety, which bears smaller fruits with a softer and sweeter flesh; and &quot;jaca-manteiga&quot;, or the &quot;butter&quot; variety, which bears sweet fruits whose flesh has a consistency intermediate between the &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;soft&quot; varieties.

==== Africa ====
From a tree planted for its shade in gardens, it became an ingredient for local recipes using different fruit segments. The seeds are boiled in water or roasted to remove toxic substances, and then roasted for a variety of desserts. The flesh of the unripe jackfruit is used to make a savory salty dish with smoked pork. The jackfruit arils are used to make jams or fruits in syrup, and can also be eaten raw.

=== Materials ===

==== Wood and manufacturing ====
The golden yellow timber with good grain is used for building furniture and house construction in India. It is termite-resistant and is superior to teak for building furniture. The wood of the jackfruit tree is important in Sri Lanka and is exported to Europe. Jackfruit wood is widely used in the manufacture of furniture, doors and windows, in roof construction, and fish sauce barrels.

The wood of the tree is used for the production of musical instruments. In Indonesia, hardwood from the trunk is carved out to form the barrels of drums used in the &quot;gamelan&quot;, and in the Philippines, its soft wood is made into the body of the &quot;kutiyapi&quot;, a type of boat lute. It is also used to make the body of the Indian string instrument &quot;veena&quot; and the drums &quot;mridangam&quot;, &quot;thimila&quot;, and &quot;kanjira&quot;.

==In culture==
The jackfruit has played a significant role in Indian agriculture for centuries. Archaeological findings in India have revealed that jackfruit was cultivated in India 3,000 to 6,000 years ago. It has also been widely cultivated in Southeast Asia.

The ornate wooden plank called &quot;avani palaka&quot;, made of the wood of the jackfruit tree, is used as the priest&#x27;s seat during Hindu ceremonies in Kerala. In Vietnam, jackfruit wood is prized for the making of Buddhist statues in temples The heartwood is used by Buddhist forest monastics in Southeast Asia as a dye, giving the robes of the monks in those traditions their distinctive light-brown color.

Jackfruit is the national fruit of Bangladesh, and the state fruit of the Indian states of Kerala (which hosts jackfruit festivals) and Tamil Nadu.

<doc id="335099" wikidata="Q2920974" url="?curid=335099" title="Lubya">
<text>Lubya ( &quot;bean&quot;), sometimes referred to as Lubia, Lubieh and Loubieh, was a Palestinian Arab town located ten kilometers west of Tiberias that was captured and destroyed by Israel during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War where its residents were forcefully evacuated and became refugees. Nearby villages included Nimrin to the north, Hittin to the northwest, and al-Shajara to the south; Each of those villages were also depopulated.

Lubya had a total land area of 39,629 dunams (3,963ha), of which 83% was Palestinian-owned and the remainder public property. Most of its cultivable land was planted with cereals while only 1,500 dunams (150 ha) were planted with olive groves. The village&#x27;s built-up area was 210 dunams (21 ha).

==History==
Archaeological excavations have revealed remains dating from the Roman era, second century BCE until the fifth century CE.

The village was known as &quot;Lubia&quot; by the Crusaders and was a rest stop for Saladin&#x27;s Ayyubid army prior to the Battle of Hattin. It is the birthplace of a prominent 15th century Muslim scholar Abu Bakr al-Lubyani, who taught Islamic religious sciences in Damascus.

===Ottoman era===
Lubya belonged to the &quot;nahiya&quot; (&quot;district&quot;) of Tiberias in the 1596 tax records, a few decades after the Ottoman Empire won control over the region from the Mamluks. Its population was recorded as 182 households and 32 bachelors, an estimated 1,177 persons; all Muslim. The village was required to pay taxes on its goats, beehives and its olive press, but most of the revenues (45,000 Akçe) were paid as a fixed amount. Total taxes were 46,700 akçe.

In 1743, the Ottoman governor of Damascus, Sulayman Pasha al-Azm died in the village while on his way to confront the rebellious &quot;de facto&quot; Arab ruler of the Galilee, Zahir al-Umar. A map by Pierre Jacotin, from 1799 showed the place named &quot;Loubia.&quot;

Lubya is near the site of Khan Lubya which is filled with the ruins of a pool, cisterns and large building stones. This site was probably a caravansary during medieval times.

In the early 19th century, James Silk Buckingham described Lubya as a very large village on top of a high hill. Johann Ludwig Burckhardt, a Swiss traveler to Palestine, referred to the village as &quot;Louby&quot; and noted that wild artichokes covered the village plain. The American scholar Edward Robinson, who passed through the village in 1838, noted that it had suffered greatly from the Galilee earthquake of 1837, with 143 villagers reported dead.

Mark Twain mentioned it in his 1869 travel book, &quot;The Innocents Abroad&quot;: &quot;We jogged along peacefully over the great caravan route from Damascus to Jerusalem and Egypt, past Lubia and other Syrian hamlets, perched, in the unvarying style, upon the summit of steep mounds and hills, and fenced round about with giant cactuses&quot;.

In 1875, the French explorer Victor Guérin visited the village, called &quot;Loubieh&quot;, and estimated it had 700 inhabitants. He further noted that: &quot;A house built of cut stones of medium size in the direction of east and west appears to occupy the site, and to be built out of old materials formerly used for a Christian Church&quot;.

Later that century, the village was described as being built of stone, on top of a limestone hill. Its population, estimated to be between 400 and 700, cultivated olive and fig trees.

A population list from about 1887 showed &quot;Lubieh&quot; to have about 2,730 inhabitants; all Muslims.

An elementary school was established in 1895 and remained in use throughout the rule of the British Mandate of Palestine from 1923 to 1947.

===British Mandate era===
In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities the population was 1,712; 1,705 Muslims, four Christians and three Druze, increasing in the 1931 census to 1,850; 1,849 Muslims and one Christian, in a total of 405 houses.
During this period, Lubya was the second largest village in the Tiberias District.

According to the Palestine Government&#x27;s village statistics, Lubya had a population of 2,350 in 1945 statistics, all Muslim. All the inhabitants were Muslim. The total land area was 39,629 dunams. Of this, a total of 1,655 dunams were for plantations and irrigable land, 32,310 for cereals, while a total of 210 dunams were built-up land.

===Occupation by Israel===


At the onset of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War Lubya was being defended by local militia volunteers. Village forces constantly skirmished with the Jewish militias which would soon become the Israeli Army; the first Israeli raid on the village occurred on January 20, 1948, coordinated with one on nearby Tur&#x27;an, leaving one Lubya resident dead. On February 24, local militiamen and Arab Liberation Army (ALA) members ambushed a Jewish convoy on the village&#x27;s outskirts, causing several casualties, including one militiaman. The attack signaled that the Israelis were unable to keep the roads open and that foreign volunteers (the ALA) were taking over the offensive in the eastern Galilee.

In early March, Israeli forces attempted to create a route between Tiberias and the village of Shajara, which required attacking Lubya. During the attack militiamen repulsed the Israelis, killing seven and losing six of their own.

After Tiberias was occupied by Israel, Lubya turned to the ALA in nearby Nazareth for military support and guidance.

In early June, the 14th. battalion from the Golani Brigade was ordered to take Lubya and &quot;to expel its inhabitants&quot;. However, the attack failed, due to heavy resistance from the villagers.

The ALA attacked the Jewish town of Sejera on June 10 at the time when a truce was being brokered between Lubya&#x27;s militiamen and Israeli forces. After the truce expired on July 16, Israel launched Operation Dekel, capturing Nazareth at the start.

After news of Nazareth&#x27;s fall, the majority of non-combatant village residents fled north towards Lebanon or to nearby Arab towns. The ALA also withdrew, leaving the local militia to confront incoming forces. When a single Israeli armored unit appeared outside the village, the militia retreated and left the village. The few remaining residents reported that Israeli forces subsequently shelled Lubya, demolished a few houses and commandeered many others. The village was finally demolished in the 1960s.

The Israeli town of Lavi was built on Lubya&#x27;s land, northeast of the village site. There are also two parks on the village lands: the Lavi Pine Forest and the South African Park. They are used as picnic grounds for local residents, including former residents of Lubya who are internally displaced persons living in various existing Arab localities in Israel.

In the 1990s, two books were published about Lubya by &quot;Ibrahim Yahya Al-Shahabi&quot;, one under the auspices of Birzeit University, and one book about Lubya was published in Denmark, in 1995, by &quot;Mahmoud Issa&quot;.

==Demographics==
The village&#x27;s population rose and dropped dramatically throughout its history; In 1596, Lubya had a population of 1,177 dropping to about 400–700 in the beginning of the 19th century.

The village&#x27;s residents predominantly adhered to Islam. It was estimated that there was 16,741 Palestinian refugees descending from Lubya in 1998. After 1948, the majority of refugees lived at the Wavel refugee camp in Lebanon and other places in Lebanon, Jordan and Syria. A few hundred remained in Israel as present absentees, living first in Kafr Kana. After the departure of the PLO from Lebanon in 1983 and the Sabra and Shatila massacres, many Lubya refugees emigrated from Lebanon to Europe. By 2003 about 2,000 lived in Denmark, Sweden and Germany.

<text>The following is a list of weapons shown in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe.

==By type==
=== Directed-energy weapons===

Directed-energy weapons (DEW) figure prominently in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, with the most common type referred to as lasers or blasters. The in-universe description for how these weapons function is that a high-energy gas is charged by a power cell and converted into plasma, which is fired as a coherent energy bolt at the enemy via magnetic bottle effect. Small-arms blasters come in many types, from pistols to rifles, with accuracy and range improving as barrel length increases. Blaster cannons and laser cannons are more powerful types of these weapons commonly found on &quot;Star Wars&quot; vehicles, starfighters and other spacecraft, with laser cannons generally considered superior of the two. The most powerful type of these weapons are referred to as turbolasers, commonly found on &quot;Star Wars&quot; capital ships. Turbolasers require large crews and power generators to function but are effective against other capital ships and planetary targets.

Another common type of DEW in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe is the ion cannon, which background literature describes as firing powerful bolts of ionized energy designed to overload electrical systems or fuse mechanical components, disabling a target without causing lasting damage. Jawas use scrap-built ionization blasters to disable droids as seen in &quot;A New Hope&quot;. The v-150 Planet Defender which appears in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; defends the Rebel base on Hoth. A surface-based ion cannon designed to ward off orbiting starships, the v-150 is described as having a maximum range of and is powerful enough to disrupt an Imperial Star Destroyer with a single bolt.

A unique type of DEW appearing in &quot;Star Wars&quot; films and other media are sonic weapons. Such weapons are commonly used by bounty hunters as a way to incapacitate their prey according to background material. It also refers to Geonosians specifically as being well-known within the setting for their sonic weaponry. First appearing in &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;, Geonosian sonic weapons are described as using oscillators to create powerful sonic blasts which are enveloped in plasma-containment spheres and fired at the enemy.

=== Projectile weapons ===
Within the star wars canon, Projectile weapons, are referred to as slugthrowers, appear in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe in various forms. Reference material identifies the Tusken Raiders as using a type of slugthrower called a cycler rifle, built from stolen and scavenged parts and firing a solid shot enveloped in energy. The bounty hunter Aurra Sing is also identified as wielding an Adventurer slugthrower rifle, which is described as flooding the firing chamber with a rich oxidizer as it detonates its shell to give the projectile extra range and power.

The bowcaster is a crossbow-like weapon carried by Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew/Joonas Suotamo) during the events of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films. Canonically, bowcasters were developed by the Wookiees and were a favorite weapon of theirs; other races were generally not strong enough to operate the cocking mechanism. Their function is described in reference material as firing a metal bolt called a quarrel. Alternating polarizer orbs on either end of the bow create a magnetic field which propels the quarrel forward, emerging from the barrel enveloped in blaster energy to give it an explosive impact.

Chirrut Îmwe (Donnie Yen) carries a custom-built bowcaster in &quot;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story&quot;. Identified as a lightbow, the weapon operates on the same principle as a Wookie bowcaster and is said to be more powerful than a heavy blaster rifle, allowing Chirrut to shoot down a TIE fighter during the events of the film.

=== Rockets and missiles ===
The usage of rockets and missiles is seen frequently throughout the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, including in films, comics, and novels. Within the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe, these weapons are seen as complementary to energy weapons thanks to their ability to go around obstacles to hit targets, including those hiding behind the horizon, and to be fitted with a variety of mission-specific warheads, including antimatter, electromagnetic pulse, and hard radiation. However unlike a blaster bolt a missile can be shot down and is more easily dodged. The use of inertial compensators and tensor fields allow &quot;Star Wars&quot; missiles to withstand turning accelerations of up to 10,000 G without damaging their components.

In the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; movie, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) destroys the Death Star by firing a pair of proton torpedoes into its exhaust port. Proton torpedoes are described in background literature as missile weapons which can be fired at long-range targets and, upon impact, release clouds of high-velocity protons to damage the enemy. These weapons can display incredible maneuverability, such as making a 90-degree turn within a turning circle of one meter.

Another type of missile weapon are concussion missiles, such as those seen in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; when Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) pilots the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; into the Death Star II and destroys its reactor with a pair of concussion missiles. Concussion missiles are said to be primarily used for atmospheric combat, where their explosions create devastating sonic booms and ground tremors that can cause tremendous devastation. However their warheads are still powerful enough that they are effective when used in space combat.

Not all missile weapons in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe carry explosive warheads. The discord missile is a type described by in-universe material as agile enough to avoid anti-missile fire and deploy up to seven buzz droids on a target vessel. These droids then use their mechanical arms and cutting tools to inflict as much damage on the vessel as possible. Discord missiles were first seen in &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; during the opening space battle as a group of missile-deployed buzz droids attack Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) in his Jedi interceptor.

Many individual characters are seen or described as using rockets and missiles in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe. The bounty hunter Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison) wears a jet pack which can fire an anti-vehicle homing missile, which he uses against Obi-Wan Kenobi in their duel on Kamino in &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;. Boba Fett (Jeremy Bulloch) also wears a jet pack which can fire either a homing missile or grappling hook, and carries a wrist-mounted mini concussion rocket launcher which can fire a variety of small homing rockets.

=== Other explosive devices ===
Hand-held explosive devices are commonly seen and mentioned in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; saga and other media. Many hold a large amount of explosive power in a small package and can be triggered in a variety of ways, such as remotely or via timed fuse. Examples include concussion disks, EMP grenades, and thermal detonators. In &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, a disguised Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) threatens Jabba the Hutt with a Class-A thermal detonator. &quot;Star Wars&quot; fiction describes these devices as filled with a volatile baradium core surrounded by a thermite shell and capable of disintegrating anything within a blast radius.

Another example of unique explosive devices are the Gungan weapons that feature in the climactic battle of &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; and are referred to in &quot;Star Wars&quot; literature as &quot;boomas.&quot; It describes these grenade-type weapons as containing plasmic energy which is mined from deep in the porous crust of Naboo and contained within protective shells. Upon impact these shells burst, releasing the plasma and a powerful electric shock on the target. These weapons come in multiple sizes, from handheld types that can be thrown to larger artillery shells launched by catapults and powerful enough to disable an armored tank.

Larger explosive devices include the seismic charges seen on film in &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;, where Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison) deploys them in an attempt to destroy Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and prevent him from pursuing him. According to the Star Wars Databank, these weapons draw in sound and explode in devastating concussive waves of energy. Another is the electro-proton bomb which made its first appearance in the 2008 &quot;Clone Wars&quot; television series. Deployed on the planet Malastare, the bomb disabled an entire droid army in one blast but also awakened a slumbering Zillo Beast.

===Melee ===
The &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe also makes extensive use of melee weapons, such as staffs, swords, batons and whips. The most notable of those is the lightsaber. The presence of those types of weapons allows for dramatic combat sequences such as lightsaber combat.
A Gaffii Stick or Gaderiffi is a staff weapon with a heavy end which appears similar to the medieval flanged mace. These weapons are described in background material as being hand-crafted by Tusken Raiders using a variety of materials, though with a preference for durable metals. They can be wielded a number of different ways to kill an opponent, or to incapacitate them when coated with the paralyzing venom of the fictional sandbat creature native to Tatooine.

An electrostaff is a melee weapon which is designed to withstand lightsaber strikes. According to reference literature, they accomplish this task thanks to the fictional material Phrik, a rare and virtually indestructible alloy which conducts energy. Either end of the staff features electromagnetic modules which, when activated, are sheathed in energy tendrils and deliver debilitating electrical charges that can be adjusted to lethal levels. These weapons made their first theatrical appearance in &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; being used by General Grievous&#x27;s bodyguards, the IG-100 MagnaGuards, and have featured in other &quot;Star Wars&quot; media.

Similar to the electrostaff is the Z6 riot control baton, which made its theatrical appearance in &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; and is utilized by the First Order&#x27;s stormtroopers to quell riots. Collapsible conductor contact veins are capable of delivering a powerful electric shock to incapacitate an opponent and can deflect a lightsaber blade. Reference literature also states the baton&#x27;s adhesive grip pairs magnatomically with a stormtrooper&#x27;s gloves.

Other types of melee weapons have featured in &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; continuity. The amphistaff is the primary anti-personnel living weapon of the Yuuzhan Vong. Amphistaff scales can produce an edge harder than a diamond&#x27;s that can stop a lightsaber. In addition to its default staff/spear configuration, an amphistaff can be wielded as a whip or flail by selectively hardening parts of its body.

Vibroweapons are a highly lethal class of melee weapon that utilises a generator, usually located on the weapon&#x27;s hilt, to create supersonic vibrations. Many variations of vibroweapon exist; due to the adaptable nature of vibroweapon generators, vibroweapons can be made out of axes, pikes, knives, and swords. At least as far back as 3956 BBY, vibroweapons have often been laced with &quot;Cortosis&quot; (a rare metal known to short out lightsabers). This allows the user of the vibroblade to defend themself against a lightsaber wielding opponent. Vibroweapons have been used by characters in various media, such as Lando Calrissian from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies and Mission Vao from &quot;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic&quot;. The Emperor&#x27;s Imperial guards, as seen in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, use &quot;Force Pikes.&quot; These not only have a vibrating power tip, but can be set to deliver an electric stun charge. In order to allow this conductivity, the shaft of the force pike is made of reinforced graphite. Not only does this allow the pike to flex to absorb impact rather than breaking, but also means the weapon weighs no more than 7 kg and can therefore be handled with extreme swiftness and agility for a weapon of its length.

====Lightsabers====

Lightsabers (also known as laser swords or rens) are described as one of the most rare and mysterious weapons of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe and are generally used by the Jedi, the Sith, and the Knights of Ren, with Mandalorian rulers wielding the darksaber. The standard lightsaber is a sword-like weapon that emits a blade of pure energy from its metal hilt which has no mass but can cut through almost anything and deflect blaster bolts. The core of the lightsaber is a kyber crystal, which according to &quot;Star Wars&quot; canon acts as the focusing element and takes on a specific color when it &quot;bonds&quot; with someone sensitive to the Force. Variations on the standard design include double-bladed lightsabers like the one wielded by Maul (Ray Park) in &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;.

<text>The Japanese Instrument of Surrender was the written agreement that formalized the surrender of the Empire of Japan, marking the end of hostilities in World War II. It was signed by representatives from the Empire of Japan and from the Allied nations: the United States of America, the Republic of China, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the Commonwealth of Australia, the Dominion of Canada, the Provisional Government of the French Republic, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and the Dominion of New Zealand. The signing took place on the deck of in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945.

The date is sometimes known as Victory over Japan Day. However, that designation more frequently refers to the date of Emperor Hirohito&#x27;s &quot;Gyokuon-hōsō&quot; (Imperial Rescript of Surrender), the radio broadcast announcement of the acceptance of the terms of the Potsdam Declaration at noon Japan Standard Time on 15 August.

==Preparation==
General Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s staff, headed by Colonel LeGrande A. Diller, were tasked to prepare the draft of the Instrument of Surrender. This was a challenge given resources were limited in war-torn Manila. Nevertheless, an enterprising staff member found rare parchment in a basement of a monastery, and this was given to MacArthur&#x27;s printer.

==Surrender ceremony==
The ceremony aboard the deck of &quot;Missouri&quot; lasted 23 minutes and was broadcast throughout the world. It occurred at in Tokyo Bay. The instrument was first signed by the Japanese foreign minister Mamoru Shigemitsu &quot;By Command and on behalf of the Emperor of Japan and the Japanese Government&quot; (9:04 a.m.). General Yoshijirō Umezu, Chief of the Army General Staff, then signed the document &quot;By Command and on behalf of the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters&quot; (9:06 a.m.).
The Japanese representatives present for the signing were the following:
* Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu
* General Yoshijirō Umezu, Chief of the Army General Staff
* Major General Yatsuji Nagai
* Katsuo Okazaki (Foreign Ministry)
* Rear Admiral Tadatoshi Tomioka
* Toshikazu Kase (Foreign Ministry)
* Lt. General Suichi Miyakazi
* Rear Admiral Ichiro Yokoyama
* Saburo Ota (Foreign Ministry)
* Captain Katsuo Shiba (Navy)
* Colonel Kaziyi Sugita

At 9:08 a.m., American General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, the Commander in the Southwest Pacific and Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, accepted the surrender on behalf of the Allied Powers and signed in his capacity as Supreme Commander.

After MacArthur, the following representatives signed the instrument of surrender on behalf of each of the Allied Powers:
* Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz for the United States (9:12 a.m.)
* General Hsu Yung-chang for China (9:13 a.m.)
* Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser for the United Kingdom (9:14 a.m.)
* Lieutenant General Kuzma Derevyanko for the Soviet Union (9:16 a.m.)
* General Sir Thomas Blamey for Australia (9:17 a.m.)
* Colonel Lawrence Moore Cosgrave for Canada (9:18 a.m.)
* Général de Corps d&#x27;Armée Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque for France (9:20 a.m.)
* Lieutenant Admiral Conrad Helfrich for the Netherlands (9:21 a.m.)
* Air Vice-Marshal Leonard M. Isitt for New Zealand (9:22 a.m.)

The UK invited Dominion governments to send representatives to the ceremony as subordinates to its own. MacArthur supported the government of Australia&#x27;s demand to attend and sign separately from the UK, although Australia objected to his recommendation that Canada, the Netherlands, and France also sign the document.

On 6 September, Colonel Bernard Theilen took the document and an imperial rescript to Washington, D.C., and presented them to President Harry S. Truman in a formal White House ceremony the following day. Following a ceremony led by Gen. Jonathan Wainwright, the documents were then exhibited at the National Archives. On October 1, 1945, the documents were formally received (accessioned) into the holdings of the National Archives.

==Flags at the ceremony==

The deck of the &quot;Missouri&quot; was furnished with two U.S. flags. A commonly heard story is that one of the flags had flown over the White House on the day Pearl Harbor was attacked. However, Captain Stuart Murray of USS &quot;Missouri&quot; explained:

That special flag on the veranda deck of the &quot;Missouri&quot; had been flown from Commodore Matthew Perry&#x27;s flagship in 1853–54 when he led the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Far East Squadron into Tokyo Bay to force the opening of Japan&#x27;s ports to foreign trade.

Photographs of the signing ceremony show that this flag is displayed reverse side showing (stars in the upper right corner). This was because U.S. flags on the right of an object, plane, ship, or person have the stars on the upper right corner, to look like the flag is heading into as if attached to a pole and someone is carrying it. Stars in the upper left of a flag displayed on the right side of the object could make the flag look like it were going away from battle. The cloth of the historic flag was so fragile that the conservator at the U.S. Naval Academy Museum directed that a protective backing be sewn on it, leaving its &quot;wrong side&quot; visible; and this was how Perry&#x27;s 31-star flag was presented on this unique occasion.

A replica of this historic flag can be seen today on the Surrender Deck of the Battleship &quot;Missouri&quot; Memorial in Pearl Harbor. The original flag is still on display at the Naval Academy Museum, as is the table and tablecloth upon which the instrument of surrender was signed, and the original bronze plaque marking the location of the signing (which was replaced by two replicas in 1990).

==Differences between versions==

The Japanese copy of the treaty varied from the Allied in the following ways:
* The Canadian representative, Colonel Lawrence Moore Cosgrave, signed below his line instead of above it on the Japanese copy, so everyone after him had to sign one line below the intended one. This was attributed to Cosgrave being blind in one eye from a World War I injury. When the discrepancy was pointed out to General Sutherland, he crossed out the pre-printed name titles of the Allied nations and rewrote by hand the titles in their correct relative positions. The Japanese initially found this alteration unacceptable—until Sutherland initialed (as an abbreviated signature) each alteration. The Japanese representatives did not complain further.

==Current locations==
The Allied copy of the Instrument is at the United States National Archives Building in Washington, D.C. The Japanese copy is at the Diplomatic Archives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan in Tokyo, and was last publicly displayed in 2015, as part of an exhibition marking the 70th anniversary of the signing. A replica version of the Japanese copy can be viewed at the archive&#x27;s gallery, and at the Edo-Tokyo Museum in Tokyo.

Gen. MacArthur originally had 11 full-sized facsimiles made of the Instrument of Surrender, but later increased this for distribution among the Allied nations present during the signing. Two of the copies which were given to Col. LeGrande A. Diller and MGen. Basilio Valdes for the Philippines are now displayed at The International Museum of World War II in Natick, Massachusetts.

As witnesses, American general Jonathan Wainwright, who had surrendered the Philippines, and British lieutenant-general Arthur Percival, who had surrendered Singapore, received two of the six pens used by General MacArthur to sign the instrument. Another pen went to the West Point military academy, and one to MacArthur&#x27;s aide. All of the pens used by MacArthur were black, except the last, which was bright red and went to his wife. A replica of it, along with copies of the instrument of surrender, is in a case on &quot;Missouri&quot; by the plaque marking the signing spot.

The National History Museum of the Republic of China has a reprint, and the Instrument of Surrender (along with seven other historic documents) was designated as a &quot;National Treasure&quot; by the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of China in 2016.

<text>Nimrin was a Palestinian Arab town of 320 that was captured and depopulated by Israel during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.

==History==
Nimrin stood on the site of Kfar Nimra when Palestine was ruled by the Roman Empire. Its inhabitants were Jews when Saint Peter and Saint James visited the town in 30 CE.

===Ottoman era===
Nimrin was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in the early sixteenth century CE, and by the 1596 tax records the village was under the administration of the &quot;nahiya&quot; (&quot;subdistrict&quot;) of Tiberias, part of Safad Sanjak. It had a population of 20 households, an estimated 110 persons, all Muslim. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on agricultural products, such as on wheat barley, wheat, olives, beehives, and goats; a total of 3,920 akçe. 1/3 of the revenue went to a waqf.

A map from Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of 1799 by Pierre Jacotin showed the place, named as &quot;Nemen&quot;.

In the nineteenth century, Nimrin grew to become a stone-built village of 250 Muslim people. It was described as being built on the slope of a hill, surrounded by arable land. The Ottomans founded an elementary school in the village.

A population list from about 1887 showed Nimrin to have about 300 inhabitants; all Muslims. 
===British Mandate era===
In 1922, Nimrin became a part of the British Mandate of Palestine and in the 1922 census of Palestine, &quot;Nemrin&quot; had a population of 273; all Muslims, increasing in the 1931 census to 316, still all Muslims, in a total of 71 houses.

The main economic sectors were farming and livestock, with grain being the most important crop, followed by vegetables. The Ottoman school was closed down during this period.

In the 1945 statistics the population consisted of 320 Muslims, and the total land area was 12,019 dunams. Of this, Arabs used 7,905 dunams for cereals, 335 for plantations and irrigable land, while 64 dunams were classified as built-up (urban) area.

===1948 war, and aftermath===
During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Nimrin fell into Israeli hands on July 17, 1948, after nearby Lubya was captured at the end of Operation Dekel. Its entire population of 320 (1945) fled for unclear reasons. According to Walid Khalidi, &quot;the site and a major part of the lands are surrounded by a fence.&quot;

<doc id="335104" wikidata="Q1253380" url="?curid=335104" title="Human Rights Campaign">
<text>The Human Rights Campaign (HRC) is an American LGBTQ advocacy group. It is the largest LGBTQ political lobbying organization within the United States. Based in Washington, D.C., the organization focuses on protecting and expanding rights for LGBTQ individuals, including advocating for same-sex marriage, anti-discrimination and hate crimes legislation, and HIV/AIDS advocacy. The organization has a number of legislative initiatives as well as supporting resources for LGBTQ individuals.

==Structure==
HRC is an umbrella group of two separate non-profit organizations and a political action committee: the HRC Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization that focuses on research, advocacy and education; the Human Rights Campaign, a 501(c)(4) organization that focuses on promoting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) rights through lobbying Congress and state and local officials for support of pro-LGBTQ bills, and mobilizing grassroots action amongst its members; and the HRC Political Action Committee, a super PAC which supports and opposes political candidates.

===Leadership===
Kelley Robinson was announced as the new president of the Human Rights Campaign on September 20, 2022. She succeeded Interim President Joni Madison on November 28, 2022, becoming the first Black queer woman to lead the organization.

HRC&#x27;s work is supported by three boards: the Board of Directors, which is the governing body for the organization; the HRC Foundation Board, which manages the foundation&#x27;s finances and establishes official policies governing the foundation; and the board of governors, which manages the organization&#x27;s local outreach nationwide.

==History==
Steve Endean, who had worked with a previously established Gay Rights National Lobby from 1978, established the Human Rights Campaign Fund political action committee in 1980. The two groups eventually merged. In 1983, Vic Basile, at the time one of the leading LGBT rights activists in Washington, D.C., was elected as the first executive director. In October 1986, the HRC Foundation (HRCF) was formed as a non-profit organization.

In January 1989, Basile announced his departure, and HRC reorganized from serving mainly as a political action committee (PAC) to broadening its function to encompass lobbying, research, education, and media outreach. HRC decided on a new Statement of Purpose: &quot;For the promotion of the social welfare of the gay and lesbian community by drafting, supporting and influencing legislation and policy at the federal, state and local level.&quot; Tim McFeeley, a Harvard Law School graduate, founder of the Boston Lesbian and Gay Political Alliance, and a co-chair of the New England HRC Committee, was elected the new executive director. Total membership was then approximately 25,000 members.

In 1992, HRC endorsed a presidential candidate for the first time, Bill Clinton. In March 1993, HRC began a new project, National Coming Out Day. Other tangible accomplishments from the 90&#x27;s are harder to document. From January 1995 until January 2004, Elizabeth Birch served as the executive director of the HRC. Under her leadership, the institution more than quadrupled its membership to 500,000 members.

In 1995, the organization dropped the word &quot;Fund&quot; from its name, becoming the Human Rights Campaign. That same year, it underwent a complete reorganization. The HRC Foundation added new programs such as the Workplace Project and the Family Project, while HRC itself broadly expanded its research, communications, and marketing/public relations functions. The organization also unveiled a new logo, a yellow equal sign inside of a blue square.
As part of the activities surrounding the Millennium March on Washington, the HRC Foundation sponsored a fundraising concert at Washington, D.C.&#x27;s RFK Stadium on April 29, 2000. Billed as a concert to end hate crimes, &quot;Equality Rocks&quot; honored hate crime victims and their families, such as featured speakers Dennis and Judy Shepard, the parents of Matthew Shepard. The event included Melissa Etheridge, Garth Brooks, Pet Shop Boys, k.d. lang, Nathan Lane, Rufus Wainwright, Albita Rodríguez, and Chaka Khan.

Elizabeth Birch&#x27;s successor, Cheryl Jacques, resigned in November 2004 after only 11 months as executive director. Jacques said she had resigned over &quot;a difference in management philosophy&quot;.

In March 2005, HRC announced the appointment of Joe Solmonese as the president. He served in that position until stepping down in May 2012 to co-chair the Barack Obama presidential campaign.

HRC launched its Religion and Faith Program in 2005 to mobilize clergy to advocate for LGBT people, and helped form DC Clergy United for Marriage Equality, which was involved in the legalization of same-sex marriage in the District of Columbia. On March 10, 2010, the first legally recognized same-sex weddings in the District of Columbia were held at the headquarters of the Human Rights Campaign.

On August 9, 2007, HRC and Logo TV co-hosted a forum for 2008 Democratic presidential candidates dedicated specifically to LGBT issues.

In 2010, HRC lobbied for the repeal of the United States ban on HIV-positive people&#x27;s entry into the country for travel or immigration.

In September 2011, it was announced that Joe Solmonese would step down as president of HRC following the end of his contract in 2012. Despite initial speculation that former Atlanta City Council president Cathy Woolard would be appointed, no replacement was announced until March 2, 2012, when American Foundation for Equal Rights co-founder Chad Griffin was announced as Solmonese&#x27;s successor. Griffin took office on June 11, 2012.

In 2012, HRC said that it had raised and contributed $20 million to re-elect President Obama and to advance same-sex marriage. In addition to the Obama re-election campaign, HRC spent money on marriage-related ballot measures in Washington, Maine, Maryland and Minnesota, and the election of Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin.

In 2013, HRC conducted a postcard campaign in support of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA).

In 2019, HRC joined with 42 other religious and allied organizations in issuing a statement opposing Project Blitz, an effort by a coalition of Christian right organizations to influence state legislation.

In May 2020, HRC endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 United States presidential election.

In June 2023, HRC declared a &quot;national state of emergency&quot; for LGBT people following a wave of anti-LGBT laws that were enacted in a number of U.S. states over the previous few years.

=== Executive directors, presidents, and CEOs ===
Beginning with the founder, the highest management position in the organization was Executive director. Beginning in 2004, the position was changed to President and CEO.
=== Funding ===

As of 2020, HRC&#x27;s annual budget was $44.6 million, and annual expenses were $44.3 million.

Each year since 1997, HRC has hosted a national dinner that serves as the organization&#x27;s single largest annual fundraiser. In 2009, President Barack Obama spoke at HRC&#x27;s 13th Annual National Dinner. In his speech, President Obama reaffirmed his pledge to repeal &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell&quot; and the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), as well as his commitment to passing the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. He gave the keynote speech in 2011 as well, reiterating his pledge to fight for DOMA repeal and for the passage of ENDA, and to combat bullying of LGBT youth. Other featured speakers at past dinners have included Bill Clinton, Maya Angelou, Kweisi Mfume, Joseph Lieberman, Hillary Clinton, Richard Gephardt, John Lewis, Rosie O&#x27;Donnell, Nancy Pelosi, Tim Gunn, Suze Orman, Sally Field, Cory Booker, Tammy Baldwin, and Betty DeGeneres.

===HRC historical records===
The historical records of the Human Rights Campaign are maintained in a collection at the Cornell University Library. Arriving at Cornell in 2004, the records include strategic planning documents, faxes, minutes, e-mails, press releases, posters, and campaign buttons. Taking up , the archive is the second largest in the library&#x27;s Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections, Human Sexuality Collection. In February 2007, the archive was opened to scholars at the library, and selected records were organized into an online exhibit called &quot;25 Years of Political Influence: The Records of the Human Rights Campaign&quot;.

==Programs and positions==
According to the organization, the Human Rights Campaign &quot;is organized for the charitable and educational purposes of promoting public education and welfare for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.&quot;

The HRC Foundation provides resources on coming out, transgender issues, LGBT-related healthcare topics, and information about workplace issues faced by LGBT people, including the Corporate Equality Index.

HRC lobbies for the passage of anti-discrimination and hate crime laws. The organization supported the passage of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which expanded federal hate-crime law to allow the Justice Department to investigate and prosecute crimes motivated by a victim&#x27;s actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.

The organization&#x27;s work on health issues traditionally focused on responding to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In recent years, HRC has addressed discrimination in health care settings for LGBT employees, patients and their families. Since 2007, the Human Rights Campaign Foundation has published the &quot;Healthcare Equality Index&quot;, which rates hospitals on issues such as patient and employee non-discrimination policies, employee cultural competency training, and hospital visitation rights for LGBT patients&#x27; families.

Lobbyists from the Human Rights Campaign worked with the Obama administration to extend hospital visitation rights to same-sex partners. HRC lobbied extensively for the repeal of the Don&#x27;t Ask Don&#x27;t Tell (DADT) law, which barred gay and lesbian people from serving openly in the United States military.

The HRC filed a lawsuit in both state and federal courts contesting the &quot;transgender sports ban&quot; law in Florida in 2021, in an attempt to block the law from going into effect (called &quot;nullification&quot;) on midnight July 1.

==Logo==
The official logo of the HRC, adopted in 1995, consists of a yellow equals sign imposed onto a blue background. The logo was created in 1995 by design firm Stone Yamashita. The previous logo used by the HRC (then known as the HRCF) featured a stylized flaming torch. HRC uses the term &quot;Equality Flag&quot; for flags bearing their logo.
===Same-sex marriage logo===
HRC shared a red version of its logo – selected by marketing director Anastasia Khoo because the color is synonymous with love – on social network services on March 25, 2013, and asked its supporters to do the same to show support for same-sex marriage in light of two cases that were before the U.S. Supreme Court (&quot;United States v. Windsor&quot; and &quot;Hollingsworth v. Perry&quot;). The logo went viral, and Facebook saw a 120% increase in the number of profile photo changes on March 26. Celebrities such as George Takei, Beyonce, Sophia Bush, Padma Lakshmi, Martha Stewart, Macklemore, Ryan Lewis and Ellen DeGeneres shared the logo with their millions of followers on social network services and politicians like Senator Claire McCaskill (D-MO), Jay Rockefeller (D-WV), and Kay Hagan (D-NC) did the same.

Brands and corporations showed their support for same-sex marriage with creative recreations of the red HRC logo. Supporters included Bud Light, Bonobos, Fab.com, Kenneth Cole, L&#x27;Occitane en Provence, Maybelline, Absolut, Marc Jacobs International, Smirnoff, Martha Stewart Weddings, and HBO&#x27;s &quot;True Blood&quot;.

Major print and online news sources reported on the success of the viral campaign, including MSNBC, &quot;Time&quot;, Mashable, and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;.

==Criticism and controversies==
Critics have taken HRC to task for its working environment. In the fall of 2014, HRC commissioned outside consultants to conduct a series of focus groups and surveys with the organization&#x27;s staff. In the report, which was obtained by BuzzFeed News, staff of the organization described the working environment at HRC as &quot;judgmental&quot;, &quot;exclusionary&quot;, &quot;sexist&quot;, and &quot;homogenous&quot;. The report stated that &quot;Leadership culture is experienced as homogenous — gay, white, male.&quot; Acknowledging the report, HRC president Chad Griffin said: &quot;Like many organizations and companies throughout our country, HRC has embarked on a thoughtful and comprehensive diversity and inclusion effort with the goals of better representing the communities we serve.&quot; In August 2015, Pride at Work, an LGBT affiliate of the AFL–CIO, approved a resolution that calls on member organizations to stop funding HRC until the group addresses what Pride at Work sees as problems with HRC&#x27;s Corporate Equality Index.

HRC has been accused of overstating the number of its actual members in order to appear more influential in politics. Former HRC President Joe Solmonese responded, saying that &quot;[m]embership is about more than contributions ... [i]t&#x27;s about sending e-mails to elected officials, volunteering time or lobbying members of Congress&quot; and more than half of its members made contributions during the previous two years. Earlier, HRC spokesperson Steven Fisher stated that its membership includes anyone who has donated at least $1.

HRC has also been criticized for exceedingly generous executive salaries.

===Employment Non-Discrimination Act===
Some transgender people have criticized the HRC for its stance on the 2007 version of ENDA, which at the time included sexual orientation as a protected category but not gender identity and expression. Once the legislation was submitted by Rep. Barney Frank, HRC officially neither opposed nor supported it. This followed a speech by former HRC President Joe Solmonese at the transgender Southern Comfort Conference the previous month, where he said that HRC &quot;oppose[d] any legislation that is not absolutely inclusive&quot;. HRC later explained that it could not actively support a non-inclusive bill, but did not oppose it because the legislation would strategically advance long-term efforts to pass a trans-inclusive ENDA. However, in a letter to U.S. Representatives, HRC did express support for the bill, stating that while HRC is &quot;greatly disappointed that the current version of ENDA is not inclusive ... we appreciate the steadfast efforts of our ... allies ... even when they are forced ... to make progress that is measured by inches rather than yards.&quot;

=== 2025 Mass Layoffs ===
On the evening of February 3, 2025, HRC announced to staff that the organization would be laying off approximately 20% of all employees across all levels, departments, and programs. This announcement was followed up the next morning by an exclusive article in The Advocate, which was then covered in additional LGBTQ+ outlets. On February 10, 2025, affected staff were notified if they had been laid off. The final number of layoffs significantly exceeded the 20% figure provided to press, including complete cuts to HRC&#x27;s programs serving transgender people and youth, as well as the leader of the organization&#x27;s internal DEIB team. In an interview, a staff member said, “The board has charged Kelley with ensuring a balanced budget in the face of a new environment that requires a reset as we ready ourselves for the challenges ahead. To avoid layoffs, we explored a range of cost-saving measures, from attrition to aggressively pushing revenue and evaluating program expenses, but ultimately, both strategic and budget reasons” led us to this restructuring. The organization&#x27;s Form 990 from 2023 indicates that HRC president Kelley Robinson was paid nearly $750,000 in 2023. Departing staff members were incentivized to sign a non-disparagement agreement with an additional month&#x27;s worth of severance pay, as well as an additional month of health coverage. The layoffs drew significant criticism from the LGBTQ+ community, with journalist James Factora noting the significance of the layoff&#x27;s timing amidst the first 100 days of the second Trump administration. 

=== Organizational Stance on Israel and Palestine ===
HRC has been criticized for its failure to call for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, as well as allegations that senior leadership routinely silence internal criticism of HRC&#x27;s position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It has been alleged that official statements from the organization downplay the impact of the occupation on Palestinians, and focus on the impact of the crisis on Americans. On June 6, 2024, journalist and &quot;Them&quot; contributor Samantha Riedel published a lengthy report uplifting multiple accounts of the organization&#x27;s dismissal and ostracization of anti-Zionist staff stretching back at least a decade.

On February 3, 2024, a protest organized by ACT UP New York took place outside Human Rights Campaign&#x27;s 2024 Greater New York Dinner in Manhattan. The protestors publicly denounced HRC&#x27;s acceptance of donations from Northrop Grumman, a weapons manufacturer that supplied weapons to the Israeli military during the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip. The protestors additionally demanded HRC leadership to publicly call for an end to Israel&#x27;s bombardment of Gaza. HRC events continue to be met by protests from members of the LGBTQ+ community demanding that the organization end its relationships with weapons manufacturers and stand in solidarity with Palestine.

=== Endorsements ===
HRC has been criticized both for favoring the Democratic Party and for endorsements of Republican candidates. Andrew Sullivan, a gay political columnist and blogger, has called HRC &quot;a patronage wing of the Democratic party.&quot; However, HRC has also received backlash and criticism for several nominations of Republican candidates when their Democratic opponents scored higher on HRC&#x27;s own index.

==== Endorsements of Republicans ====
HRC was criticized for its endorsement of New York Republican Al D&#x27;Amato in his 1998 campaign for re-election to the U.S. Senate. HRC defended the endorsement because of D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s support for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) and the repeal of &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell&quot;. However, many liberal LGBT leaders objected to D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s conservative stances, including his opposition to affirmative action and abortion, and thought that HRC should have taken those positions into account when deciding on the endorsement.

In 2014, long-time supporter of same-sex marriage Shenna Bellows was nominated for a U.S. Senate seat in Maine. HRC endorsed her opponent, incumbent Republican Senator Susan Collins, who had previously lacked a history of supporting same-sex marriage initiatives. However, Collins later clarified her view in support gay marriage.

On March 11, 2016, HRC voted to endorse Republican U.S. Senator Mark Kirk over his Democratic Party challenger Representative Tammy Duckworth in his re-election bid to the United States Senate. Though Kirk later announced his support for same-sex marriage, the endorsement was met with widespread surprise and criticism in news media and social media as HRC had given Kirk a score of 78 percent out of 100 percent on LGBT issues, while it had awarded Duckworth a score of 100 percent. David Nir at Daily Kos called the endorsement as &quot;appalling as it is embarrassing&quot; and &quot;pathetic and stupid&quot;, while &quot;Slate&quot; observed that Democratic control of the Senate was effectively necessary for passing the Equality Act of 2015 and beneficial for many other LGBT equality issues, and thus it would be in line with the organization&#x27;s stated goals for Duckworth to be elected rather than Kirk. Meanwhile, &quot;The New Republic&quot; stated that, in light of a recent internal report revealing HRC&#x27;s &quot;serious diversity problem&quot;, &quot;Choosing the white male candidate in this race over the Asian-American female candidate—someone who happens to have a better voting record anyway—is probably the worst way of convincing your detractors that you are taking a core problem seriously.&quot; HRC president Chad Griffin defended the endorsement in a column published by the &quot;Independent Journal Review&quot;, describing the senator&#x27;s work on behalf of LGBT equality issues, including co-sponsoring the Equality Act of 2015. Griffin stated: &quot;The truth is we need more cross party cooperation on issues of equality, not less&quot;, adding &quot;when members of Congress vote the right way and stand up for equality — regardless of party — we must stand with them. We simply cannot ask members of Congress to vote with us, and then turn around and try to kick them out of office.&quot;

On October 28, 2016, on the day following Mark Kirk&#x27;s controversial debate comment on Tammy Duckworth&#x27;s heritage, HRC explicitly stated their endorsement of Kirk &quot;remains unchanged&quot; while asking him to &quot;rescind&quot; his comment. &quot;Slate&quot; stated this proved HRC&#x27;s &quot;worst critics right&quot; and that HRC &quot;is simply irredeemable&quot;. On October 29, two days after the comment, HRC described Kirk&#x27;s statement as &quot;deeply offensive and racist,&quot; revoked its endorsement of Kirk, and instead endorsed Duckworth for the U.S. Senate.

====Endorsements of Democrats====

In the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Human Rights Campaign&#x27;s 32-person Board of Directors voted to endorse Hillary Clinton for president. This resulted in considerable controversy, causing thousands of users on HRC&#x27;s Facebook page to post comments critical of the decision. Many cited HRC&#x27;s own &quot;congressional scorecard&quot; (which records a 100% rating for her rival for the Democratic nomination, Bernie Sanders, while Clinton herself only scores 89%) as inconsistent with their endorsement. Additional scrutiny was also placed upon the connections Clinton herself has to the organization when it was revealed that HRC&#x27;s President, Chad Griffin, had previously been employed by Clinton&#x27;s husband, former U.S. President Bill Clinton.

In the 2018 New York gubernatorial election, the Human Rights Campaign endorsed incumbent governor Andrew Cuomo. However, Cynthia Nixon, who is bisexual, announced that she was running on March 25, 2018. Despite this, HRC still supported Cuomo. In response, HRC received criticism for not supporting an LGBTQ+ candidate, and supporting her opponent instead. Jimmy Van Bramer, a gay New York City Council Member who endorsed Nixon, said, &quot;The HRC endorsement hurts Cynthia Nixon&#x27;s chances,&quot; and that &quot;coming out against a viable progressive queer woman is the wrong thing to do.&quot;

===Alphonso David and Governor Andrew Cuomo===
A report released in August 2021 following an independent investigation led by New York Attorney General Letitia &quot;Tish&quot; James described then HRC president Alphonso David&#x27;s efforts to cover up sexual harassment claims against Governor Andrew Cuomo (prior to joining HRC, David was chief counsel to Cuomo) and undermine the credibility of accusers. David allegedly released the full personnel file of accuser (and former Cuomo adviser) Lindsey Boylan to the governor&#x27;s office. Her file was then leaked to the press. David also assisted in drafting an unpublished letter in support of Cuomo and questioning Boylan&#x27;s motivations. On September 6, 2021, David was fired as president of HRC. In February 2022, David filed a lawsuit against the Human Rights Campaign, alleging discrimination. He argued that the organization underpaid him and eventually fired him because of his race, while also saying the organization has a &quot;deserved reputation for unequal treatment of its non-white employees.&quot;

<doc id="335109" wikidata="Q186191" url="?curid=335109" title="Compressive strength">
<text>In mechanics, compressive strength (or compression strength) is the capacity of a material or structure to withstand loads tending to reduce size (compression). It is opposed to &quot;tensile strength&quot; which withstands loads tending to elongate, resisting tension (being pulled apart). In the study of strength of materials, compressive strength, tensile strength, and shear strength can be analyzed independently.

Some materials fracture at their compressive strength limit; others deform irreversibly, so a given amount of deformation may be considered as the limit for compressive load. Compressive strength is a key value for design of structures.

Compressive strength is often measured on a universal testing machine. Measurements of compressive strength are affected by the specific test method and conditions of measurement. Compressive strengths are usually reported in relationship to a specific technical standard.

== Introduction ==
When a specimen of material is loaded in such a way that it extends it is said to be in &quot;tension&quot;. On the other hand, if the material compresses and shortens it is said to be in &quot;compression&quot;.

On an atomic level, molecules or atoms are forced together when in compression, whereas they are pulled apart when in tension. Since atoms in solids always try to find an equilibrium position, and distance between other atoms, forces arise throughout the entire material which oppose both tension or compression. The phenomena prevailing on an atomic level are therefore similar.

The &quot;strain&quot; is the relative change in length under applied stress; positive strain characterizes an object under tension load which tends to lengthen it, and a compressive stress that shortens an object gives negative strain. Tension tends to pull small sideways deflections back into alignment, while compression tends to amplify such deflection into buckling.

Compressive strength is measured on materials, components, and structures.

The ultimate compressive strength of a material is the maximum uniaxial compressive stress that it can withstand before complete failure. This value is typically determined through a compressive test conducted using a universal testing machine. During the test, a steadily increasing uniaxial compressive load is applied to the test specimen until it fails. The specimen, often cylindrical in shape, experiences both axial shortening and lateral expansion under the load. As the load increases, the machine records the corresponding deformation, plotting a stress-strain curve that would look similar to the following:

The compressive strength of the material corresponds to the stress at the red point shown on the curve. In a compression test, there is a linear region where the material follows Hooke&#x27;s law. Hence, for this region, formula_1 where, this time, refers to the Young&#x27;s modulus for compression. In this region, the material deforms elastically and returns to its original length when the stress is removed.

This linear region terminates at what is known as the yield point. Above this point the material behaves plastically and will not return to its original length once the load is removed.

There is a difference between the engineering stress and the true stress. By its basic definition the uniaxial stress is given by:

formula_2where is load applied [N] and is area [m2].

As stated, the area of the specimen varies on compression. In reality therefore the area is some function of the applied load i.e. . Indeed, stress is defined as the force divided by the area at the start of the experiment. This is known as the engineering stress, and is defined byformula_3where is the original specimen area [m2].

Correspondingly, the engineering strain is defined byformula_4where is the current specimen length [m] and is the original specimen length [m]. True strain, also known as logarithmic strain or natural strain, provides a more accurate measure of large deformations, such as in materials like ductile metalsformula_5The compressive strength therefore corresponds to the point on the engineering stress–strain curve formula_6 defined byformula_7
formula_8

where is the load applied just before crushing and is the specimen length just before crushing.

== Deviation of engineering stress from true stress ==
When a uniaxial compressive load is applied to an object it will become shorter and spread laterally so its original cross sectional area (formula_9) increases to the loaded area (formula_10). Thus the true stress (formula_11) deviates from engineering stress (formula_12). Tests that measure the engineering stress at the point of failure in a material are often sufficient for many routine applications, such as quality control in concrete production. However, determining the true stress in materials under compressive loads is important for research focused on the properties on new materials and their processing.

The geometry of test specimens and friction can significantly influence the results of compressive stress tests. Friction at the contact points between the testing machine and the specimen can restrict the lateral expansion at its ends (also known as &#x27;barreling&#x27;) leading to non-uniform stress distribution. This is discussed in section on contact with friction. 

=== Frictionless contact ===
With a compressive load on a test specimen it will become shorter and spread laterally so its cross sectional area increases and the true compressive stress isformula_13and the engineering stress isformula_14The cross sectional area (formula_10) and consequently the stress ( formula_16) are uniform along the length of the specimen because there are no external lateral constraints. This condition represents an ideal test condition. For all practical purposes the volume of a high bulk modulus material (e.g. solid metals) is not changed by uniaxial compression. Soformula_17Using the strain equation from aboveformula_18andformula_19Note that compressive strain is negative, so the true stress (formula_20 ) is less than the engineering stress (formula_21). The true strain (formula_22) can be used in these formulas instead of engineering strain (formula_23) when the deformation is large.

=== Contact with friction ===
As the load is applied, friction at the interface between the specimen and the test machine restricts the lateral expansion at its ends. This has two effects:

* It can cause non-uniform stress distribution across the specimen, with higher stress at the centre and lower stress at the edges, which affects the accuracy of the result.
* It causes a barreling effect (bulging at the centre) in ductile materials. This changes the specimen&#x27;s geometry and affects its load-bearing capacity, leading to a higher apparent compressive strength.

Various methods can be used to reduce the friction according to the application:

* Applying a suitable lubricant, such as MoS2, oil or grease; however, care must be taken not to affect the material properties with the lubricant used.
* Use of PTFE or other low-friction sheets between the test machine and specimen. 
* A spherical or self-aligning test fixture, which can minimize friction by applying the load more evenly across the specimen&#x27;s surface.
Three methods can be used to compensate for the effects of friction on the test result:

# Correction formulas
# Geometric extrapolation
# Finite element analysis

==== Correction formulas ====

Round test specimens made from ductile materials with a high bulk modulus, such as metals, tend to form a barrel shape under axial compressive loading due to frictional contact at the ends. For this case the equivalent true compressive stress for this condition can be calculated usingformula_24where
:formula_25
:formula_26
:formula_27
:formula_28 is the loaded length of the test specimen,
:formula_29is the loaded diameter of the test specimen at its ends, and
:formula_30is the maximum loaded diameter of the test specimen.
Note that if there is frictionless contact between the ends of the specimen and the test machine, the bulge radius becomes infinite (formula_31) and formula_32. In this case, the formulas yield the same result as formula_33 because formula_34 changes according to the ratio formula_35.

The parameters (formula_36) obtained from a test result can be used with these formulas to calculate the equivalent true stress formula_16 at failure. 

The graph of specimen shape effect shows how the ratio of true stress to engineering stress (σ´/σe) varies with the aspect ratio of the test specimen (formula_38). The curves were calculated using the formulas provided above, based on the specific values presented in the table for specimen shape effect calculations. For the curves where end restraint is applied to the specimens, they are assumed to be fully laterally restrained, meaning that the coefficient of friction at the contact points between the specimen and the testing machine is greater than or equal to one (μ ⩾ 1). As shown in the graph, as the relative length of the specimen increases (formula_39), the ratio of true to engineering stress (formula_40) approaches the value corresponding to frictionless contact between the specimen and the machine, which is the ideal test condition. 

==== Geometric extrapolation ====

As shown in the section on correction formulas, as the length of test specimens is increased and their aspect ratio approaches zero (formula_41), the compressive stresses (σ) approach the true value (σ′). However, conducting tests with excessively long specimens is impractical, as they would fail by buckling before reaching the material&#x27;s true compressive strength. To overcome this, a series of tests can be conducted using specimens with varying aspect ratios, and the true compressive strength can then be determined through extrapolation.

==== Finite element analysis ====
== Comparison of compressive and tensile strengths ==
Concrete and ceramics typically have much higher compressive strengths than tensile strengths. Composite materials, such as glass fiber epoxy matrix composite, tend to have higher tensile strengths than compressive strengths. Metals are difficult to test to failure in tension vs compression. In compression metals fail from buckling/crumbling/45° shear which is much different (though higher stresses) than tension which fails from defects or necking down.

== Compressive failure modes ==

If the ratio of the length to the effective radius of the material loaded in compression (Slenderness ratio) is too high, it is likely that the material will fail under buckling. Otherwise, if the material is ductile yielding usually occurs which displaying the barreling effect discussed above. A brittle material in compression typically will fail by axial splitting, shear fracture, or ductile failure depending on the level of constraint in the direction perpendicular to the direction of loading. If there is no constraint (also called confining pressure), the brittle material is likely to fail by axial splitting. Moderate confining pressure often results in shear fracture, while high confining pressure often leads to ductile failure, even in brittle materials.

Axial Splitting relieves elastic energy in brittle material by releasing strain energy in the directions perpendicular to the applied compressive stress. As defined by a materials Poisson ratio a material compressed elastically in one direction will strain in the other two directions. During axial splitting a crack may release that tensile strain by forming a new surface parallel to the applied load. The material then proceeds to separate in two or more pieces. Hence the axial splitting occurs most often when there is no confining pressure, i.e. a lesser compressive load on axis perpendicular to the main applied load. The material now split into micro columns will feel different frictional forces either due to inhomogeneity of interfaces on the free end or stress shielding. In the case of stress shielding, inhomogeneity in the materials can lead to different Young&#x27;s modulus. This will in turn cause the stress to be disproportionately distributed, leading to a difference in frictional forces. In either case this will cause the material sections to begin bending and lead to ultimate failure.

=== Microcracking ===

Microcracks are a leading cause of failure under compression for brittle and quasi-brittle materials. Sliding along crack tips leads to tensile forces along the tip of the crack. Microcracks tend to form around any pre-existing crack tips. In all cases it is the overall global compressive stress interacting with local microstructural anomalies to create local areas of tension.  Microcracks can stem from a few factors.

# Porosity is the controlling factor for compressive strength in many materials. Microcracks can form around pores, until about they reach approximately the same size as their parent pores. (a)
# Stiff inclusions within a material such as a precipitate can cause localized areas of tension. (b) When inclusions are grouped up or larger, this effect can be amplified.
# Even without pores or stiff inclusions, a material can develop microcracks between weak inclined (relative to applied stress) interfaces. These interfaces can slip and create a secondary crack. These secondary cracks can continue opening, as the slip of the original interfaces keeps opening the secondary crack (c). The slipping of interfaces alone is not solely responsible for secondary crack growth as inhomogeneities in the material&#x27;s Young&#x27;s modulus can lead to an increase in effective misfit strain. Cracks that grow this way are known as wingtip microcracks.

The growth of microcracks is not the growth of the original crack or imperfection. The cracks that nucleate do so perpendicular to the original crack and are known as secondary cracks. The figure below emphasizes this point for wingtip cracks.
These secondary cracks can grow to as long as 10-15 times the length of the original cracks in simple (uniaxial) compression. However, if a transverse compressive load is applied. The growth is limited to a few integer multiples of the original crack&#x27;s length.

==== Shear bands ====
If the sample size is large enough such that the worse defect&#x27;s secondary cracks cannot grow large enough to break the sample, other defects within the sample will begin to grow secondary cracks as well. This will occur homogeneously over the entire sample. These micro-cracks form an echelon that can form an “intrinsic” fracture behavior, the nucleus of a shear fault instability. Shown right:

Eventually this leads the material deforming non-homogeneously. That is the strain caused by the material will no longer vary linearly with the load. Creating localized shear bands on which the material will fail according to deformation theory. “The onset of localized banding does not necessarily constitute final failure of a material element, but it presumably is at least the beginning of the primary failure process under compressive loading.”

== Compressive strength of concrete ==

For designers, compressive strength is one of the most important engineering properties of concrete. It is standard industrial practice that the compressive strength of a given concrete mix is classified by grade. Cubic or cylindrical samples of concrete are tested under a compression testing machine to measure this value. Test requirements vary by country based on their differing design codes. Use of a Compressometer is common. As per Indian codes, compressive strength of concrete is defined as:

&quot;The &quot;compressive strength of concrete&quot; is given in terms of the &quot;characteristic compressive strength&quot; of 150 mm size cubes tested after 28 days (fck). In field, compressive strength tests are also conducted at interim duration i.e. after 7 days to verify the anticipated compressive strength expected after 28 days. The same is done to be forewarned of an event of failure and take necessary precautions. The characteristic strength is defined as the strength of the concrete below which not more than 5% of the test results are expected to fall.&quot;

For design purposes, this compressive strength value is restricted by dividing with a factor of safety, whose value depends on the design philosophy used.

The construction industry is often involved in a wide array of testing. In addition to simple compression testing, testing standards such as ASTM C39, ASTM C109, ASTM C469, ASTM C1609 are among the test methods that can be followed to measure the mechanical properties of concrete. When measuring the compressive strength and other material properties of concrete, testing equipment that can be manually controlled or servo-controlled may be selected depending on the procedure followed. Certain test methods specify or limit the loading rate to a certain value or a range, whereas other methods request data based on test procedures run at very low rates.

Ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) is defined as having a compressive strength over 150 MPa.

<doc id="335111" wikidata="Q4129041" url="?curid=335111" title="Weapons in science fiction">
<text>Strange and exotic weapons are a recurring feature in science fiction. In some cases, weapons first introduced in science fiction have been made a reality; other science-fiction weapons remain purely fictional, and are often beyond the realms of known physical possibility.

At its most prosaic, science fiction features an endless variety of sidearms—mostly variations on real weapons such as guns and swords. Among the best-known of these are the phaser—used in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series, films, and novels—and the lightsaber and blaster—featured in &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies, comics, novels, and TV shows.

Besides adding action and entertainment value, weaponry in science fiction sometimes touches on deeper concerns and becomes a theme, often motivated by contemporary issues. One example is science fiction that deals with weapons of mass destruction.

==In early science fiction ==
Weapons of early science-fiction novels were usually bigger and better versions of conventional weapons, effectively more advanced methods of delivering explosives to a target. Examples of such weapons include Jules Verne&#x27;s &quot;fulgurator&quot; and the &quot;glass arrow&quot; of the Comte de Villiers de l&#x27;Isle-Adam.

A classic science-fiction weapon, particularly in British and American science-fiction novels and films, is the raygun. A very early example of a raygun is the Heat-Ray featured in H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; (1898). 

The discovery of X-rays and radioactivity in the last years of the 19th century led to an increase in the popularity of this family of weapons, with numerous examples in the early 20th century, such as the disintegrator rays of George Griffith&#x27;s future-war novel &quot;The Lord of Labour&quot; (1911). Early science-fiction film often showed raygun beams giving off bright light and loud noise like lightning or large electric arcs. 

Wells also prefigured modern armored warfare with his description of tanks in his 1903 short story &quot;The Land Ironclads&quot;, and aerial warfare in his 1907 novel &quot;The War in the Air&quot;.

== Lasers and particle beams ==

Arthur C. Clarke envisaged particle beam weapons in his 1955 novel &quot;Earthlight&quot;, in which energy would be delivered by high-velocity beams of matter.

After the invention of the laser in 1960, it briefly became the death ray of choice for science-fiction writers. For instance, characters in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; pilot episode &quot;The Cage&quot; (1964) and in the &quot;Lost in Space&quot; TV series (1965–1968) carried handheld laser weapons.

By the late 1960s and 1970s, as the laser&#x27;s limits as a weapon became evident, the raygun began to be replaced by similar weapons with names that better reflected the destructive capabilities of the device. These names ranged from the generic &quot;pulse rifle&quot; to series-specific weapons, such as the phasers from &quot;Star Trek&quot;. According to &quot;The Making of Star Trek&quot;, Gene Roddenberry claimed that production staff realized that using laser technology would cause problems in the future as people came to understand what lasers could and could not do; this resulted in the move to phasers on-screen, while letting lasers be known as a more primitive weapon style.

In the &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; franchise, a human faction known as the Imperial Guard has a &quot;lasgun&quot;, which is described as being a handheld laser weapon, as their main weapon, and larger cannon versions being mounted onto tanks and being carried around by Space Marines. The elf-like Aeldari, meanwhile, have a special unit called the Swooping Hawks equipped with a &quot;lasblaster&quot;.

In the &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; video game series, various factions make extensive use of laser and particle-beam technology. The most notable are Allied units Prism Tank from &quot;Red Alert 2&quot; and Athena Cannon from &quot;Red Alert 3&quot;, the Nod&#x27;s Avatar and Obelisk of Light from &quot;Tiberium Wars&quot;, as well as various units from &quot;Generals&quot; constructed by USA faction, including their &quot;superweapon&quot; particle cannon.

== Plasma weaponry ==
Weapons using plasma (high-energy ionized gas) have been featured in a number of fictional universes.

== Weapons of mass destruction ==

Nuclear weapons are a staple element in science-fiction novels. The phrase &quot;atomic bomb&quot; predates their existence, and dates back to H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The World Set Free&quot; (1914), when scientists had discovered that radioactive decay implied potentially limitless energy locked inside of atomic particles (Wells&#x27; atomic bombs were only as powerful as conventional explosives, but would continue exploding for days on end). Cleve Cartmill predicted a chain reaction-type nuclear bomb in his 1944 science-fiction story &quot;Deadline&quot;, which led to the FBI investigating him, due to concern over a potential breach of security on the Manhattan Project.

The use of radiological, biological, and chemical weapons is another common theme in science fiction. In the aftermath of World War I, the use of chemical weapons, particularly poison gas, was a major worry, and was often employed in the science fiction of this period, for example Neil Bell&#x27;s &quot;The Gas War of 1940&quot; (1931). Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s 1940 story &quot;Solution Unsatisfactory&quot; posits radioactive dust as a weapon that the US develops in a crash program to end World War II; the dust&#x27;s existence forces drastic changes in the postwar world. In &quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot;, set in the 22nd century, Daleks are claimed to have invaded Earth after it was bombarded with meteorites and a plague wiped out entire continents.

A subgenre of science fiction, postapocalyptic fiction, uses the aftermath of nuclear or biological warfare as its setting.

The Death Star is the &quot;Star Wars&quot; equivalent to a weapon of mass destruction, and as such, might be the most well-known weapon of mass destruction in science fiction.

== Cyberwarfare and cyberweapons ==
The idea of cyberwarfare, in which wars are fought within the structures of communication systems and computers using software and information as weapons, was first explored by science fiction.

John Brunner&#x27;s 1975 novel &quot;The Shockwave Rider&quot; is notable for coining the word &quot;worm&quot; to describe a computer program that propagates itself through a computer network, used as a weapon in the novel. William Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Neuromancer&quot; coined the phrase cyberspace, a virtual battleground in which battles are fought using software weapons and counterweapons. The &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;A Taste of Armageddon&quot; is another notable example.

Certain Dale Brown novels place cyberweapons in different roles. The first is the &quot;netrusion&quot; technology used by the U.S. Air Force. It sends corrupt data to oncoming missiles to shut them down, as well as hostile aircraft by giving them a &quot;shutdown&quot; order in which the systems turn off one by one. It is also used to send false messages to hostiles, to place the tide of battle in the favor of America. The technology is later reverse-engineered by the Russian Federation to shut down American antiballistic missile satellites from a tracking station at Socotra Island, Yemen.

Cyberwarfare has moved from a theoretical idea to something that is now seriously considered as a threat by modern states.

In a similar but unrelated series of incidents involved various groups of hackers from India and Pakistan who hacked and defaced several websites of companies and government organizations based in each other&#x27;s country. The actions were committed by various groups based in both countries, but not known to be affiliated with the governments of India or Pakistan. The cyber wars are believed to have begun in 2008 following the Mumbai attacks believed to be by a group of Indian cyber groups hacking into Pakistani websites. Hours after the cyber attacks, a number of Indian websites (both government and private) were attacked by groups of Pakistani hackers, claiming to be retaliation for Indian attacks on Pakistani websites. The back and forth attacks have persisted on occasions since then.
== War on the mind ==

Themes of brainwashing, conditioning, memory-erasing, and other mind-control methods as weapons of war feature in much science fiction of the late 1950s and 1960s, paralleling the contemporary panic about communist brainwashing, existence of sleeper agents, and the real-world attempts of governments in programs such as MK-ULTRA to make such things real.

David Langford&#x27;s short story &quot;BLIT&quot; (1988) posits the existence of images (called &quot;basilisks&quot;) that are destructive to the human brain, which are used as weapons of terror by posting copies of them in areas where they are likely to be seen by the intended victims. Langford revisited the idea in a fictional FAQ on the images, published by the science journal &quot;Nature&quot; in 1999. The neuralyzer from the &quot;Men in Black&quot; films are compact objects that can erase and modify the short-term memories of witnesses by the means of a brief flash of light, ensuring that no one remembers encountering either aliens or the agents themselves.

The TV series &quot;Dollhouse&quot; (2009) features technology that can &quot;mindwipe&quot; people (transforming them into &quot;actives&quot;, or &quot;dolls&quot;) and replace their inherent personalities with another one, either &quot;real&quot; (from another actual person&#x27;s mind), fabricated (for example, a soldier trained in many styles of combat and weaponry, or unable to feel pain), or a mixture of both. In a future timeline of the series, the technology has been devised into a mass weapon, able to &quot;remote wipe&quot; anyone and replace them with any personality. A war erupts between those controlling actives, and &quot;actuals&quot; (a term to describe those still retaining their original personas). An offshoot technology allows actual people to upload upgrades to their personas (such as fighting or language skills), similar to the process seen in &quot;The Matrix&quot;, albeit for only one skill at a time.

== Parallels between science-fiction and real-world weapons ==
Some new forms of real-world weaponry resemble weapons previously envisaged in science fiction. The early 1980s-era Strategic Defense Initiative, a proposed missile defense system intended to protect the United States from attack by ballistic strategic nuclear weapons (Intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched ballistic missiles), gained the popular name &quot;Star Wars&quot; after the popular franchise created by George Lucas.

In some cases, the influence of science fiction on weapons programs has been specifically acknowledged. In 2007, science-fiction author Thomas Easton was invited to address engineers working on a DARPA program to create weaponized cyborg insects, as envisaged in his novel &quot;Sparrowhawk&quot;.
Active research on powered exoskeletons for military use has a long history, beginning with the abortive 1960s Hardiman powered exoskeleton project at General Electric, and continuing into the 21st century. The borrowing between fiction and reality has worked both ways, with the power loader from the film &quot;Aliens&quot; resembling the prototypes of the Hardiman system. 

American military research on high-power laser weapons started in the 1960s, and has continued to the present day, with the U.S. Army planning, as of 2008, the deployment of practical battlefield laser weapons. Lower-powered lasers are currently used for military purposes as laser target designators and for military rangefinding. Laser weapons intended to blind combatants have also been developed, but are currently banned by the Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons, although low-power versions designed to dazzle rather than blind have been developed experimentally. Gun-mounted lasers have also been used as psychological weapons, to let opponents know that they have been targeted to encourage them to hide or flee without having to actually open fire on them.

<text>Paul Edmund Soldner (April 24, 1921 – January 3, 2011) was an American ceramic artist and educator, noted for his experimentation with the 16th-century Japanese technique called raku, introducing new methods of firing and post firing, which became known as American Raku. He was the founder of the Anderson Ranch Arts Center in 1966.

== Biography ==
Paul Edmund Soldner was born on April 24, 1921, in Summerfield, Illinois, his father was a Mennonite preacher. He served as a United States Army Medical Corps during World War II. Soldner served in General George Patton&#x27;s Third Army during the Battle of the Bulge, and was awarded a Purple Heart.

Soldner began to pursue a career in art upon returning to the United States after the Army, in 1946 he earned a degree from Bluffton College. He continued his studies and received a MFA degree in 1954 from the University of Colorado. Soldner then turned his attention to studying ceramics and initially focused first on functional pottery. In 1954, Soldner became Peter Voulkos&#x27; first student in the nascent ceramics department at the Los Angeles County Art Institute (now the Otis College of Art and Design). As Soldner helped his teacher establish the program, he made several changes to the studio pottery equipment, which led to him founding Soldner Pottery Equipment Corporation in 1955, to market his inventions. He eventually held seven patents related to pottery equipment.

After receiving his MFA degree in Ceramics in 1956, Soldner began teaching at Scripps College. In the 1966, he founded Anderson Ranch Arts Center in Snowmass Village, Colorado. He was also involved in starting the National Council on Education for the Ceramic Arts.

He developed a type of low-temperature salt firing. Along with Voulkos, Soldner has been credited with creating the &quot;California School&quot; of ceramic arts by combining Western materials and technology with Japanese techniques and aesthetics.

While teaching at Scripps College, he organized the Scripps Ceramics Annual, a nationally recognized ceramic exhibition. In addition, as a result of his lifelong friendship with ceramic collectors Fred and Mary Marer, Scripps became the fortunate recipient of the extensive Marer Collection of Contemporary Ceramics. In 1990, Scripps received an NEA Grant to research and organize an exhibition titled, &quot;Paul Soldner: A Retrospective,&#x27;&quot; that travelled throughout the United States.

Soldner retired from Scripps in 1991. He lived and maintained studios in Aspen, Colorado, and Claremont, California. He died January 3, 2011, in Claremont, California.

<doc id="335114" wikidata="Q148706" url="?curid=335114" title="Mansard roof">
<text>A mansard or mansard roof (also called French roof or curb roof) is a multi-sided gambrel-style hip roof characterised by two slopes on each of its sides, with the lower slope at a steeper angle than the upper, and often punctured by dormer windows. The steep roofline and windows allow for additional floors of habitable space (a garret), and reduce the overall height of the roof for a given number of habitable storeys. The upper slope of the roof may not be visible from street level when viewed from close proximity to the building.

The earliest known example of a mansard roof is credited to Pierre Lescot on part of the Louvre built around 1550. This roof design was popularised in the early 17th century by François Mansart (1598–1666), an accomplished architect of the French Baroque period. It became especially fashionable during the Second French Empire (1852–1870) of Napoléon III. &quot;Mansard&quot; in Europe (France, Germany and elsewhere) also means the attic or garret space itself, not just the roof shape and is often used in Europe to mean a gambrel roof.

== Identification ==

Two distinct traits of the mansard roof – steep sides and a double pitch – sometimes lead to it being confused with other roof types. Since the upper slope of a mansard roof is rarely visible from the ground, a conventional single-plane roof with steep sides may be misidentified as a mansard roof. The gambrel roof style, commonly seen in barns in North America, is a close cousin of the mansard. Both mansard and gambrel roofs fall under the general classification of &quot;curb roofs&quot; (a pitched roof that slopes away from the ridge in two successive planes). 

The mansard is a curb hip roof, with slopes on all sides of the building, and the gambrel is a curb gable roof, with slopes on only two sides. (The &quot;curb&quot; is a horizontal, heavy timber directly under the intersection of the two roof surfaces.) A significant difference between the two, for snow loading and water drainage, is that, when seen from above, gambrel roofs culminate in a long crease at the main ridge beam, whereas mansard roofs form a rectangular shaped crease, outlined by the curb beams, with a low-pitched roof inside this rectangle.

&quot;French roof&quot; is often used as a synonym for a mansard but is also defined as an American variation of a mansard with the lower pitches nearly vertical and larger in proportion to the upper pitches.

In France and Germany, no distinction is made between gambrels and mansards – they are both called &quot;mansards&quot;. In the French language, &quot;mansarde&quot; can be a term for the style of roof, or for the garret living space, or attic, directly within it.

== Advantages ==
The mansard style makes maximum use of the interior space of the attic and offers a simple way to add one or more storeys to an existing (or new) building without necessarily requiring any masonry. Often the decorative potential of the mansard is exploited through the use of convex or concave curvature and with elaborate dormer window surrounds.

One frequently seen explanation for the popularity of the mansard style is that it served as a method of tax avoidance. One such example of this claim, from the 1914 book &quot;How to Make a Country Place&quot;, reads, &quot;Monsieur Mansard is said to have circumvented that senseless window tax of France by adapting the windowed roof that bears his name.&quot; This is improbable in many respects: Mansart was a profligate spender of his clients&#x27; money, and while a French window tax did exist, it was enacted in 1798, 132 years after Mansart&#x27;s death, and did not exempt mansard windows.

Later examples suggest that either French or American buildings were taxed by their height (or number of storeys) to the base of the roof, or that mansards were used to bypass zoning restrictions. This last explanation is the nearest to the truth: a Parisian law had been in place since 1783, restricting the heights of buildings to 20 metres (65 feet). The height was only measured up to the cornice line, making any living space contained in a mansard roof exempt. A 1902 revision of the law permitted building three or even four storeys within such a roof.

In London in the 1930s, building regulations decreed that &quot;a building (not being a church or a chapel) shall not be erected of, or be subsequently increased to, a greater height than 80 ft., exclusive of two stories in the roof, and of ornamental towers&quot;. This was to stop buildings blocking the light, and effectively mandated mansard roofs for tall buildings.

== History and use ==
=== Early use ===
The style was popularised in France by architect François Mansart (1598–1666). Although he was not the inventor of the style, his extensive and prominent use of it in his designs gave rise to the term &quot;mansard roof&quot;, an adulteration of his name. The design tradition was continued by numerous architects, including Jules Hardouin-Mansart (1646–1708), his great-nephew, who is responsible for Château de Dampierre in Dampierre-en-Yvelines.

=== Second Empire ===

The mansard roof became popular once again during Haussmann&#x27;s renovation of Paris beginning in the 1850s, in an architectural movement known as Second Empire style.

Second Empire influence spread throughout the world, frequently adopted for large civic structures such as government administration buildings and city halls, as well as hotels and railway stations. In the United States and Canada, and especially in New England, the Second Empire influence spread to family residences and mansions, often incorporated with Italianate and Gothic Revival elements. A mansard-topped tower became a popular element incorporated into many designs, such as Main Building (Vassar College), Poughkeepsie, New York, which shows a large mansard-roofed structure with two towers.

=== 20th century ===
The 1916 Zoning Resolution adopted by New York City promoted the use of mansard roofs; rules requiring the use of setbacks on tall buildings were conducive to the mansard design.

In the 1960s and 1970s, a modernised form of mansard roof, sometimes with deep, narrow windows, became popular for both residential and commercial architecture in many areas of the United States. In many cases, these are not true mansard roofs but flat on top, the sloped façade providing a way to conceal heating, ventilation and air-conditioning equipment from view. The style grew out of interest in postmodern stylistic elements and the &quot;French eclectic&quot; house style popular in the 1930s and 1940s, and in housing also offered a way to provide an upper storey despite height restrictions. Houses with mansard roofs were sometimes described as French Provincial; architect John Elgin Woolf popularised it in the Los Angeles area, calling his houses Hollywood Regency.

<text>The European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) is a standard means for comparing academic credits, i.e., the &quot;volume of learning based on the defined learning outcomes and their associated workload&quot; for higher education across the European Union and other collaborating European countries. For successfully completed studies, ECTS credits are awarded. One academic year corresponds to 60 ECTS credits that are normally equivalent to 1500–1800 hours of total workload, irrespective of standard or qualification type. ECTS credits are used to facilitate transfer and progression throughout the Union.
ECTS also includes a standard grading scale, intended to be shown in addition to local (i.e. national) standard grades.

<doc id="335128" wikidata="Q550424" url="?curid=335128" title="Leominster">
<text>Leominster ( ) is a market town in Herefordshire, England; it is located at the confluence of the River Lugg and its tributary the River Kenwater. The town is north of Hereford and south of Ludlow in Shropshire. With a population of 11,700, Leominster is the largest of the five towns in the county; the others being Ross-on-Wye, Ledbury, Bromyard and Kington.

From 1974 to 1996, Leominster was the administrative centre for the former local government district of Leominster.

==Toponymy==
The town, previously spelled &#x27;Lemster&#x27;, takes its name from the English word minster, meaning a community of clergy and the original Celtic name for the district &quot;Leon&quot; or &quot;Lene&quot;, probably in turn from an Old Welsh root &quot;lei&quot; to flow. The Welsh name for Leominster is &quot;Llanllieni&quot;, with Llan suggesting a possible Celtic origin to the town&#x27;s religious community.

Contrary to certain reports, the name has nothing to do with Leofric, an 11th-century Earl of Mercia (most famous for being the legendarily miserly husband of Lady Godiva).

==History==

During the Early Middle Ages, Leominster was home to Æthelmod of Leominster, an English saint known to history mainly through the hagiography of the Secgan Manuscript. He is reputedly buried in Leominster.

During the 8th and 9th Century, Danes (or Vikings) frequently raided the area. In 2015, two individuals (operating without landowner permission), using metal detectors, found a large hoard near Leominster (the Herefordshire hoard) consisting primarily of Saxon jewellery and silver ingots but also coins; the latter date to around 879 AD. According to a news report, &quot;experts believe it was buried by a Viking during a series of raids&quot;, while Wessex was ruled by Alfred the Great and Mercia by Ceolwulf II of Mercia.

According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, a raid by Gruffudd ap Llywelyn on Leominster in 1052 resulted in the Battle of Llanllieni, between the Welsh and a combined force of Normans (mercenaries) and English Saxons.

Henry I bestowed the minster and its estates on Reading Abbey, which founded a priory at Leominster in 1121, although there was one here from Saxon times. Its Priory Church of St. Peter and St. Paul, which now serves as the parish church, is the remaining part of this 12th-century Benedictine monastery. Quatrefoil piers were inserted between 1872–79 by Sir George Gilbert Scott.

The priory was ransacked by the Welsh forces of Owain Glyndŵr after their victory at the Battle of Bryn Glas near Pilleth in 1402, along with several local manor houses.

Investigations to the north of the priory in 2005 located the position of the cloister, although most of the stone had been stolen following the Dissolution. Discarded animal bones found on the site when submitted to carbon dating showed that the area was occupied in the 7th century. This agrees with the date of 660 AD associated with the founding myth, which suggests a Christian community was established here by a monk, St. Eadfrith, originally from Lindisfarne in Northumbria.

Leominster is also the historical home of Ryeland sheep, a breed once famed for its wool, known as &#x27;Lemster ore&#x27;. This wool was prized above all other English wool in trade with the continent of Europe in the Middle Ages. It was the income and prosperity from this wool trade that established the town and the minster and attracted the envy of the Welsh and other regions.

From approximately 1748 to 1754, Pinsley Mill in Leominster was home to one of the Paul-Wyatt cotton mills, the first four cotton mills in the world, employing the spinning machines of Lewis Paul and John Wyatt. The mill was financed by Lancashire native Daniel Bourn, and was partly owned by other men from Lancashire. Bourn introduced his own version of the carding engine to work at this mill, and of the four Paul-Wyatt mills, it may have been the most successful, as shortly after the fire that destroyed the mill, it was reported that the cotton works &quot;had been viewed with great pleasure and admiration by travellers and all who had seen them.&quot;

One of the last ordeals by ducking stool took place in Leominster in 1809, with Jenny Pipes as the final incumbent. The ducking stool is on public display in Leominster Priory; a mechanised depiction of it is featured on the town clock.

==Climate==
The town has a maritime climate, with mild winters and summers. The data below is from a weather station in Preston Wynne, a village about 10 miles south-east of Leominster.

==Transport==

Leominster railway station is managed by Transport for Wales, who operate services on the Welsh Marches Line between South Wales and North West England. Direct services run to Cardiff, Hereford, Ludlow, Shrewsbury, Crewe and Manchester.

The town has a bus station which is the focal point for its bus services. Routes are operated by Lugg Valley Travel and First Worcester, which link Leominster with Hereford, Ludlow and Ledbury.

Leominster is a primary destination on Great Britain&#x27;s road network, being where the north-south A49 and east-west A44 roads meet. At Leominster, roads are signed towards Rhayader (A44 westbound), Worcester (A44 eastbound), Shrewsbury (A49 northbound) and Hereford (A49 southbound).

==Schools==
Earl Mortimer College, is a state comprehensive school providing secondary education for about 650 pupils. It was formerly known as the Minster school. There is also Leominster Primary School and Westfield&#x27;s Special School. Primary schools in the villages around the town include Ivington, Kimbolton, Kingsland, Luston and Stoke Prior.

== Media ==
In print, Leominster is served by the &quot;Hereford Times&quot;, &quot;The Leominster News&quot; and the &quot;Teme Valley Times&quot;.Local TV coverage are provided by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from the Ridge Hill TV transmitter.

<doc id="335129" wikidata="Q7448107" url="?curid=335129" title="Self-healing ring">
<text>A self-healing ring, or SHR, is a telecommunications term for loop network topology, a common configuration in telecommunications transmission systems. Like roadway and water distribution systems, a loop or ring is used to provide redundancy. SDH, SONET and WDM systems are often configured in self-healing rings.

==Description==
The system consists of a ring of bidirectional links between a set of stations, typically using optical fiber communications. 
In normal use, traffic is dispatched in the direction of the shortest path towards its destination.
In the event of the loss of a link, or of an entire station, the two nearest surviving stations &quot;loop back&quot; their ends of the ring. In this way, traffic can still travel to all surviving parts of the ring, even if it has to travel &quot;the long way round&quot;.

A second break in the ring may divide it into two sub-rings, but in such a case each sub-ring will remain functional.

==Advantages==
Self-healing rings offer high levels of resilience at low cost, since it is often geographically easy to take multiple paths across the landscape and link them up into a ring with very little extra fiber length.

Recent submarine communications cables are typically built in pairs to function as a self-healing ring. Very high resilience systems are typically built on interconnected meshes of self-healing rings.

Another example of a self-healing ring network technology is the FDDI local-area network. Resilient Packet Ring is a new technology for packet-switched self-healing ring networks.

<text>On May 13, 1948, a day before the state of Israel was proclaimed, the Haganah launched Operation Shfifon (, &quot;lit.&quot; Operation Cerastes Cerastes) with the aim of capturing the British outposts in the Old City of Jerusalem and preventing the Arab forces from taking control of them first. Such an eventuality had long been anticipated, and plans prepared called Operation Shfifon (&#x27;horned viper&#x27;; some translate it as &#x27;Serpent&#x27;) and quickly followed by Operation Kilshon.

<doc id="335132" wikidata="Q7226734" url="?curid=335132" title="Polyphase coil">
<text>Polyphase coils are electromagnetic coils connected together in a polyphase system such as a generator or motor. In modern systems, the number of phases is usually three or a multiple of three. Each phase carries a sinusoidal alternating current whose phase is delayed relative to one of its neighbours and advanced relative to its other neighbour. The phase currents are separated in time evenly within each period of the alternating current. For example, in a three-phase system, the phases are separated from each other by one-third of the period.

==Coil construction==
Like all coils used in electrical machinery, polyphase coils (made from insulated conducting wire) are wound around ferromagnetic armatures with radial projections and maximum core-surface exposure to the magnetic field.

The windings are physically separated around the circumference of an electrical machine. The result of such an arrangement is a rotating magnetic field that is used to convert electrical power to rotary mechanical work, or vice versa.

==Polyphase motors and generators==
Compared to single-phase motors and generators, polyphase motors are simpler, because they do not require external circuitry (using capacitors and inductors) to produce a starting torque. Polyphase machines can deliver constant power over each period of the alternating current, eliminating the pulsations found in a single-phase machine as the current passes through zero amplitude.

==History==
The use of polyphase coils in electrical power systems was pioneered by the engineers Nikola Tesla, Galileo Ferraris, and Michail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky.

<doc id="335133" wikidata="Q6645104" url="?curid=335133" title="Marquess of Zetland">
<text>Marquess of Zetland is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 22 August 1892 for the former Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lawrence Dundas, 3rd Earl of Zetland. Zetland is an archaic form of Shetland. The Dundas family descends from the wealthy Scottish businessman and Member of Parliament, Lawrence Dundas. In 1762 he was created a Baronet, of Kerse in the County of Linlithgow, in the Baronetage of Great Britain. The title was created with remainder, failing heirs male of his own, to his brother Thomas Dundas and the heirs male of his body. He was succeeded by his son, the second Baronet. He represented Richmond and Stirling in the House of Commons and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Orkney and Shetland. In 1794 he was created Baron Dundas, of Aske in the North Riding of the County of York, in the Peerage of Great Britain. Lord Dundas notably purchased the right to the earldom of Orkney and lordship of Zetland from James Douglas, 14th Earl of Morton.

His son, the second Baron, was a Member of Parliament for Richmond and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Orkney and Shetland. In 1838 he was created Earl of Zetland in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He also represented Richmond and York in Parliament and served as Lord Lieutenant of the North Riding of Yorkshire. On his death, the titles passed to his nephew, the third Earl. At first a Liberal, he held minor office in the second administration of William Ewart Gladstone but later joined the Conservative Party and served from 1889 to 1892 as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The latter year he was honoured when he was made Earl of Ronaldshay, in the County of Orkney and Zetland, and Marquess of Zetland. The Earl of Ronaldshay is the courtesy title of the eldest son and heir of the Marquess. He was succeeded by his son, the second Marquess. He was also a prominent politician and served as Governor of Bengal and as Secretary of State for India. the titles are held by his grandson, the fourth Marquess, who succeeded his father in 1989.

The family seat is Aske Hall, Richmond, North Yorkshire.

<text>Thomas Laurence Dundas, 1st Baron Dundas, FRS (16 February 1741 – 14 June 1820) was a British politician and peer who sat in the British House of Commons from 1763 to 1794 when he was raised to the peerage of Great Britain as Baron Dundas. He was responsible for commissioning the &quot;Charlotte Dundas&quot;, the world&#x27;s &quot;first practical steamboat&quot;.

==Biography==
Dundas was the only son of Sir Lawrence Dundas, 1st Baronet, the &quot;Nabob of the North&quot; and Margaret Bruce (1716-1802). Following education at Eton and St. Andrews University he did the Grand Tour, then became Member of Parliament for Richmond, 1763–1768, then for Stirlingshire, 1768–1794. He was elevated to the peerage as Baron Dundas of Aske in August 1794, and was also Lord Lieutenant and Vice Admiral of Orkney and Shetland, Councillor of state to the Prince of Wales (later George IV), President of the Society of Scottish Antiquaries and Colonel of the North York Militia. He acquired Marske Hall in North Yorkshire in 1762 after the death of Sir William Lowther, 3rd Baronet. He succeeded his father as 2nd Baronet in 1781, inheriting Aske Hall, also in North Yorkshire. Dundas also inherited policies from his father.

==&quot;Charlotte Dundas&quot;==
Dundas followed his father in having an interest in Grangemouth and in the Forth and Clyde Canal, under construction from 1768 to 1790, and he would have been aware of the 1789 trials on the canal of Patrick Miller of Dalswinton&#x27;s double-hulled paddle boat powered with a steam engine fitted by William Symington. In 1800 Dundas, as Governor of the Forth and Clyde Canal Company, engaged Symington to design a steam tug on the lines of a failed attempt by Captain John Schank for the Bridgewater Canal. At a meeting of the canal company&#x27;s directors on 5 June 1800 Dundas &quot;produced a model of a boat by Captain Schank to be worked by a steam engine by Mr Symington&quot;, and it was agreed this should be immediately put in hand.

The boat was built to Symington&#x27;s design. It had successful trials on the River Carron in June 1801 and further trials towing sloops from the river Forth up the Carron and thence along the Forth and Clyde Canal. The other proprietors of the canal were concerned about wave damage to the canal banks, and the Committee decided that the boat would &quot;by no means answer the purpose&quot;.

Symington had proposals for an improved boat which were presented in the form of a model, shown to Lord Dundas, of the boat which would become famous as the &quot;Charlotte Dundas&quot;, named in honour of one of his Lordship&#x27;s daughters. One account states that Lord Dundas had advised Symington to prepare the model and bring it to his Lordship in London, where Symington was introduced to the Duke of Bridgewater who was enthusiastic enough to immediately order eight boats of similar construction for his canal. Unfortunately, the Duke of Bridgewater died a few days before the first sailing, and nothing came of this order.

Lord Dundas and some of his relatives and friends were on board for the first sailing of the boat on the canal in 1803, but despite the success of the &quot;Charlotte Dundas&quot; fears of erosion of the banks prevailed, and the trials were ended leaving Symington out-of-pocket.

<doc id="335144" wikidata="Q537454" url="?curid=335144" title="Anglo-Saxon architecture">
<text>Anglo-Saxon architecture was a period in the history of architecture in England from the mid-5th century until the Norman Conquest of 1066. Anglo-Saxon secular buildings in Britain were generally simple, constructed mainly using timber with thatch for roofing. No universally accepted example survives above ground. Generally preferring not to settle within the old Roman cities, the Anglo-Saxons built small towns near their centres of agriculture, at fords in rivers or sited to serve as ports. In each town, a main hall was in the centre, provided with a central hearth.

There are many remains of Anglo-Saxon church architecture. At least fifty churches are of Anglo-Saxon origin with major Anglo-Saxon architectural features, with many more claiming to be, although in some cases the Anglo-Saxon part is small and much-altered. It is often impossible to reliably distinguish between pre- and post-Conquest 11th century work in buildings where most parts are later additions or alterations. The round-tower church and tower-nave church are distinctive Anglo-Saxon types. All surviving churches, except one timber church, are built of stone or brick, and in some cases show evidence of re-used Roman work.

The architectural character of Anglo-Saxon ecclesiastical buildings range from Celtic influenced architecture in the early period; Early Christian basilica influenced architecture; and in the later Anglo-Saxon period, an architecture characterised by pilaster-strips, blank arcading, baluster shafts and triangular headed openings. In the last decades of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, a more general Romanesque style was introduced from the continent, as in the now built-over additions to Westminster Abbey made from 1050 onwards, already influenced by Norman style. In recent decades, architectural historians have become less confident that all undocumented minor &quot;Romanesque&quot; features post-date the Norman Conquest. Although once common, it has been incorrect for several decades to use the plain term &quot;Saxon&quot; for anything Anglo-Saxon that is later than the initial period of settlement in Britain.

==Houses and other secular buildings==
Anglo-Saxon secular buildings were normally rectangular post-built structures, where timber posts were driven into the ground to form the framework of the walls upon which the thatched roofs were constructed. Only ten of the hundreds of settlement sites that have been excavated in England from this period have revealed masonry domestic structures and confined to a few quite specific contexts. The usual explanation for the tendency of Anglo–Saxons to build in timber is one of technological inferiority or incompetence. However it is now accepted that technology and materials were part of conscious choices indivisible from their social meaning. Le Goff suggests that the Anglo-Saxon period was defined by its use of wood, providing evidence for the care and craftsmanship that the Anglo–Saxon invested into their wooden material culture, from cups to halls, and the concern for trees and timber in Anglo–Saxon place–names, literature and religion. Michael Shapland suggests:

Anglo–Saxon building forms were very much part of this general building tradition. Timber was &#x27;the natural building medium of the age&#x27;: the very Anglo–Saxon word for &#x27;building&#x27; is &#x27;timbe&#x27;. Unlike in the Carolingian world, late Anglo–Saxon royal halls continued to be of timber in the manner of Yeavering centuries before, even though the king could clearly have mustered the resources to build in stone. Their preference must have been a conscious choice, perhaps an expression of &#x27;deeply–embedded Germanic identity&#x27; on the part of the Anglo–Saxon royalty.

Though very little contemporary evidence survives, methods of construction, including examples of later buildings, can be compared with methods on the continent. The major rural buildings were sunken-floor (&quot;Grubenhäuser&quot;) or post-hole buildings, although Helena Hamerow suggest this distinction is less clear. An excavated example is at Mucking in Essex. In addition to the sunken huts, vernacular buildings from the migration period found at Mucking included more substantial halls up to long and wide with entrances in the middle of both longer sides.

Even the elite had simple buildings, with a central fire and a hole in the roof to let the smoke escape and the largest of which rarely had more than one floor, and one room. Buildings vary widely in size, most were square or rectangular, though some round houses have been found. Frequently these buildings have sunken floors; a shallow pit over which a plank floor was suspended. The pit may have been used for storage, but more likely was filled with straw for winter insulation. A variation on the sunken floor design is found in towns, where the &quot;basement&quot; may be as deep as nine feet, suggesting a storage or work area below a suspended floor. Another common design was simple post framing, with heavy posts set directly into the ground, supporting the roof. The space between the posts was filled in with wattle and daub, or occasionally, planks. The floors were generally packed earth, though planks were sometimes used. Roofing materials varied, with thatch being the most common, though turf and even wooden shingles were also used.

The most archaeologically striking example of a royal palace is found at Yeavering (Northumbria). Excavated by Hope-Taylor, the 1977 site report illustrates a complex set of wooden halls, axially aligned. However, John Blair has made clear that, from c. 600 to c. 900, elite settlements are archaeologically invisible. From the mid-10th century onwards, a unique architectural form emerges at high-status thegnly sites – the Long Range. Comprising a combined hall and chambers, these are understood to represent a deliberate set of performative symbols of power and status put in play by the newly powerful thegnly class.

During the 9th and 10th centuries, fortifications (burhs) were constructed around towns to defend against Viking attacks. Almost no secular work remains above ground, although the Anglian Tower in York has been controversially dated to the 7th century. Recent evidence opens up the possibility that St George&#x27;s Tower, Oxford, may be a surviving part of the defences surrounding the Anglo-Saxon burh of Oxford. There is a reconstruction of an Anglo-Saxon settlement at West Stow in Suffolk, and contemporary illustrations of both secular and religious buildings are sometimes found in illuminated manuscripts.

== Church architecture: historical context ==

The fall of Roman Britain at the beginning of the fifth century, according to Bede, allowed an influx of invaders from northern Germany including the Angles and Saxons.

The Angles and the Saxons had their own religion, but Christianity was on its way. St Patrick, a Romano-British man, converted Ireland to Christianity, from where much of Western Scotland was converted and much of Northumbria was reconverted. Links were also established between the Christian communities in Ireland and those in Wales and the West country at sites such as St Piran&#x27;s Oratory which represents some of the earliest Christian architecture extant on the British mainland. The architecture though was initially influenced by Coptic monasticism.
Examples of this can be seen today in the form of rectangular dry-stone corbelled structures such as at Gallarus Oratory, Dingle and Illauntannig, Ireland. Christianity and Irish influence came to England through missionaries. In 635, a centre of Celtic Christianity was established at Lindisfarne, Northumbria, where St Aidan founded a monastery.

In 597, the mission of Augustine from Rome came to England to convert the southern Anglo-Saxons, and founded the first cathedral and a Benedictine monastery at Canterbury. These churches consisted of a nave with side chambers.

In 664 a synod was held at Whitby, Yorkshire, and differences between the Celtic and Roman practices throughout England were reconciled, mostly in favour of Rome. Larger churches developed in the form of basilicas, for example at All Saints&#x27; Church, Brixworth.

The Romano-British populations of Wales, the West Country, and Cumbria experienced a degree of autonomy from Anglo-Saxon influence, represented by distinct linguistic, liturgical and architectural traditions, having much in common with the Irish and Breton cultures across the Celtic Sea, and allying themselves with the Viking invaders. This was however, gradually elided by centuries of English dominance. Characteristically circular buildings as opposed to rectangular, often in stone as well as timber, along with sculptured Celtic crosses, holy wells and the reoccupation of Iron Age and Roman sites from hillforts such as Cadbury Castle, promontory hillforts such as Tintagel, and enclosed settlements called Rounds characterise the western Sub-Roman Period up to the 8th century in southwest England and continue much later in independent Wales at post-Roman cities such as Caerleon and Carmarthen.
Subsequent Danish (Viking) invasion marked a period of destruction of many buildings in England, including in 793 the raid on Lindisfarne. Buildings including cathedrals were rebuilt, and the threat of conflict had an inevitable influence on the architecture of the time. During and after the reign of Alfred the Great (871–899), towns (burhs) were fortified. Contemporary defensive banks and ditches can still be seen today as a result of this. Oxford is an example of one of these fortified towns, where the eleventh-century stone tower of St Michael&#x27;s Church has prominent position beside the former site of the North gate. The building of church towers, replacing the basilican narthex or West porch, can be attributed to this late period of Anglo-Saxon architecture.

== 7th century ==

In contrast to secular buildings, stone was used from very early on to build churches, although a single wooden example has survived at Greensted Church, which is now thought to be from the end of the period. Bede makes it clear in both his Ecclesiastical History and his Historiam Abbatum that the masonry construction of churches, including his own at Jarrow, was undertaken &quot;morem Romanorum&quot;, &quot;in the manner of the Romans&quot;, in explicit contrast to existing traditions of timber construction. Even at Canterbury, Bede believed that St Augustine&#x27;s first cathedral had been &#x27;repaired&#x27; or &#x27;recovered&#x27; (recuperavit) from an existing Roman church, when in fact it had been newly constructed from Roman materials. The belief was &quot;the Christian Church was Roman therefore a masonry church was a Roman building&quot;.

The earliest surviving Anglo-Saxon architecture dates from the 7th century, essentially beginning with Augustine of Canterbury in Kent from 597; for this he probably imported workmen from Frankish Gaul. The cathedral and abbey in Canterbury, together with churches in Kent at Minster in Sheppey (c.664) and Reculver (669), and in Essex at the Chapel of St Peter-on-the-Wall at Bradwell-on-Sea (where only the nave survives), define the earliest type in southeast England. A simple nave without aisles provided the setting for the main altar; east of this a chancel arch, perhaps a triple arch opening as at Reculver, separated off the apse for use by the clergy. However, there is no surviving complete 7th-century church with an apse. Flanking the apse and east end of the nave were side chambers serving as sacristies; further porticus might continue along the nave to provide for burials and other purposes. Exceptions to this include the Old Minster, Winchester.

Church designs at the time differed between the North of England, which are narrow with square ended chancels, rather than the apses of the south. In Northumbria the early development of Christianity was influenced by the Irish mission, important churches being built in timber. Masonry churches became prominent from the late 7th century with the foundations of Wilfrid at Ripon and Hexham, and of Benedict Biscop at Monkwearmouth-Jarrow. These buildings had long naves and small rectangular chancels; porticus sometimes surrounded the naves. Elaborate crypts are a feature of Wilfrid&#x27;s buildings. The best preserved early Northumbrian church is Escomb Church.

*Hexham Abbey crypt (674)
*Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Priory, Northumberland (&quot;c.&quot; 675)
*Escomb Church, County Durham (&quot;c.&quot; 680)

== 8th to 10th centuries ==

Little is attributable to the 8th and 9th centuries, due to the regular Viking raids. Developments in design and decoration may have been influenced by the Carolingian Renaissance on the continent, where there was a conscious attempt to create a Roman revival in architecture.

*St Wystan&#x27;s Church, Repton, Derbyshire (crypt &quot;c.&quot; 750, chancel walls ninth century)
*St Mary&#x27;s Priory Church, Deerhurst, Gloucestershire (&quot;c.&quot; 930)
*All Saints&#x27; Church, Earls Barton, Northamptonshire
*St Helen&#x27;s Church, Skipwith, North Yorkshire (tower &quot;c.&quot; 960)
*St Peter&#x27;s Church, Barton-upon-Humber, North Lincolnshire (tower &quot;c.&quot; 970, baptistery possibly ninth century)
*St Laurence&#x27;s Church, Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire

== 11th century ==
The 11th century saw the first appearance of the High Romanesque style in Britain. The decades before the Conquest were prosperous for the elite, and there was great patronage of church building by figures such as Lady Godiva. Many cathedrals were constructed, including Westminster Abbey, although all these were subsequently rebuilt after 1066. Norman workers may have been imported for Westminster Abbey through the Norman Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert of Jumièges.

Recent arguments and recent archaeological discoveries have raised the possibility that the 11th-century St George&#x27;s Tower, Oxford, predates both the foundation of Oxford Castle and the Norman Conquest, and functioned as a gate tower commanding the western entrance into the pre-Conquest burh. If so, the tower was then incorporated into the Norman castle built on the site in the 1070s, instead of being constructed along with it as architectural historians have long assumed. It would thus be almost without parallel in England as a purely secular and defensive Anglo-Saxon structure (see below, Secular architecture).

*Greensted Church, Essex (1013 with oak palisade walls)
*Stow Minster, Lincolnshire (&quot;c.&quot; 1040 with a small part surviving from 975)

*St Nicholas&#x27; Church, Worth, West Sussex (&quot;c.&quot; 950 – 1050)
*Church of St Mary the Blessed Virgin, Sompting, West Sussex (&quot;c.&quot; 1050)
*Odda&#x27;s Chapel, Deerhurst, Gloucestershire (1056)
*St Matthew&#x27;s Church, Langford, Oxfordshire (formerly Berkshire) (after 1050)
*The tower of Holy Trinity Church in Colchester, Essex has a pre-Conquest 11th-century tower built out of Roman rubble
*St George&#x27;s Tower, Oxford, Oxfordshire (now a part of Oxford Castle but possibly of pre-Conquest construction date)

== Diagnostic features ==
There are many churches that contain Anglo-Saxon features, although some of these features were also used in the early Norman period. H.M. Taylor surveyed 267 churches with Anglo-Saxon architectural features and ornaments. Architectural historians used to confidently assign all Romanesque architectural features to after the Conquest, but now realize that many may come from the last decades of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom. Typical Anglo-Saxon features include:
* long-and-short quoins;
* double triangular windows;
* narrow, round-arched windows (often using Roman tile);
* herringbone stone work;
* west porch (narthex).

It is rare for more than one of these features to be present in the same building. A number of early Anglo-Saxon churches are based on a basilica with north and south &quot;porticus&quot; (projecting chambers) to give a cruciform plan. However cruciform plans for churches were used in other periods. Similarly, a chancel in the form of a rounded apse is often found in early Anglo-Saxon churches, but can be found in other periods as well.

<text>ZynAddSubFX (also now called Zyn-Fusion) is a free and open-source software synthesizer for Linux, Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows. Version 3&#x27;s new user interface was initially released under proprietary terms, but is now open source (though prebuilt binaries are still sold to fund development).

For sound generation it has three hybrid synth engines that combine additive, subtractive, Fourier and other synthesis methods. No external samples are used to produce the sound; everything is done by synthesis.
The synthesizer has effects like reverberation, echo, chorus, distortion, equalization and others, and supports microtonal tunings.

The original author of ZynAddSubFX is Romanian programmer Nasca Octavian Paul. The project was started in March 2002 and the first public version (1.0.0) was released on September 25, 2002. Since 2009, the new maintainer is Mark McCurry.

==Sound generation==
ZynAddSubFX combines several different methods of audio synthesis in order to create sounds: additive synthesis by the ADSynth engine, subtractive synthesis by the SUBSynth engine, and an original algorithm used to generate wavetables in the PADSynth engine.

==Music made with ZynAddSubFX==
ZynAddSubFX was featured in the KVR One-Synth-Challenge contest.

In November 2013, Unfa released an album that was entirely made with ZynAddSubFX.
Slavonic pagan ambient project Svitlo albums were created using ZynAddSubFX as synthesizer.
