<text>The kinkajou ( ; Potos flavus) is a tropical rainforest mammal of the family Procyonidae related to olingos, coatis, raccoons, and the ringtail and cacomistle. It is the only member of the genus Potos and is also known as the &quot;honey bear&quot; (a name that it shares with the unrelated sun bear). Though kinkajous are arboreal, they are not closely related to any other tree-dwelling mammal group (primates, some mustelids, etc.).

Native to Mexico, Central and South America, this mostly frugivorous mammal is seldom seen by people because of its strict nocturnal habits. However, it is hunted for the pet trade, its skin (to make wallets and horse saddles), and its meat. The species has been included in Appendix III of CITES by Honduras, which means that exports from Honduras require an export permit, and exports from other countries require a certificate of origin or of re-export. They may live up to 40 years in captivity.

==Etymology==

The common name &quot;kinkajou&quot; derives from , based on the Algonquian name for the wolverine. It is similar to the Ojibwe word &quot;kwi·nkwaʔa·ke&quot;. Its other names in English include honey bear, night ape, and night walker. Throughout its range, several regional names are used; for instance, the Dutch names &quot;nachtaap&quot;, &quot;rolbeer&quot;, and &quot;rolstaartbeer&quot; are used in Suriname. Many names come from Portuguese, Spanish, and local dialects, such as &quot;jupará&quot;, &quot;huasa&quot;, &quot;cuchi cuchi&quot;, &quot;leoncillo&quot;, &quot;marta&quot;, &quot;perro de monte&quot;, and &quot;yapará&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
A. M. Husson, of the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie (Leiden), discussed the rather complicated nomenclature of the kinkajou in &quot;The Mammals of Suriname&quot; (1978). In his 1774 work &quot;Die Säugethiere in Abbildungen nach der Natur&quot;, Schreber listed three items under the name &quot;&quot;Lemur flavus&quot; Penn.&quot;: on page 145 is a short translation of Pennant&#x27;s description of the yellow maucauco (later identified to be &quot;Lemur mongoz&quot;, presently known as the mongoose lemur) from his 1771 work &quot;A Synopsis of Quadrupeds&quot; (page 138, second figure on plate 16); on plate 42 is a depiction of the yellow maucauco by Schreber; the last item is a reference to &quot;A Synopsis of Quadrupeds&quot; itself. Husson noted that the last item is actually Pennant&#x27;s description of an animal that is clearly a kinkajou. Husson therefore concluded that &quot;Lemur flavus&quot; is actually a &quot;composite species&quot; based on Schreber&#x27;s specimen of the mongoose lemur and Pennant&#x27;s specimen of the kinkajou, and identified the latter as the lectotype for the species. 
The type locality reported by Schreber for &quot;L. flavus&quot; (&quot;the mountains in Jamaica&quot;) was clearly based on Pennant&#x27;s description of the kinkajou, who claimed, however, that his specimen was &quot;shown about three years ago in London: its keeper said it came from the mountains of Jamaica&quot;. This error was pointed out by Thomas in 1902, who corrected the type locality to Suriname. He used the name &quot;Potos flavus&quot; for the kinkajou. The genus &quot;Potos&quot; was erected by Saint-Hilaire and Cuvier in 1795, with the type species &quot;Viverra caudivolvula&quot; described by Schreber in 1778 (later identified as a synonym of &quot;Potos flavus&quot;). In 1977 the family Cercoleptidae was proposed with the kinkajou as the sole member, but this classification was later dismissed.

=== Subspecies ===
Eight subspecies have been proposed (type localities are listed alongside):

*&quot;P. f. chapadensis&quot; : Chapadas of Mato Grosso (Brazil)
*&quot;P. f. chiriquensis&quot; : Boquerón, Chiriquí Province (Panama)
*&quot;P. f. flavus&quot; : Suriname. Synonyms include &quot;Cercoleptes brachyotos&quot;, &quot;C. brachyotus&quot;, &quot;Mustela potto&quot;, and &quot;Viverra caudivolvula&quot; 
*&quot;P. f. megalotus&quot; : Santa Marta (Colombia) 
*&quot;P. f. meridensis&quot; : Mérida (Venezuela)
*&quot;P. f. modestus&quot; : Montes Balzar, Guayas Province (Ecuador)
*&quot;P. f. nocturnus&quot; : São Miguel dos Campos, Alagoas (Brazil)
*&quot;P. f. prehensilis&quot; : Veracruz (Mexico)

A 2016 phylogenetic study based on mitochondrial gene cytochrome b analyzed kinkajou specimens from a variety of locations throughout most of their range. The results showed 27 haplotypes split into five clades corresponding to geographical divisions: Costa Rica (clade 1), northern Brazil and the Guianas (clade 2), northern Peru (clade 3), Ecuador and Panama (clade 4), interfluves between the Branco River and Rio Negro in the Brazilian Amazon, low-lying Amazonian areas (in Bolivia, western Brazil and Peru), and eastern Atlantic Forest (clade 5). Given the diverse clades, the researchers suggested that some of the subspecies might be independent species.

== Evolution ==

A 2007 phylogenetic study showed that kinkajous form a basal lineage sister to the rest of the Procyonidae. They diverged 21.6–24 Mya. Two clades, one leading to &quot;Bassaricyon&quot; (olingos and the olinguito) plus &quot;Nasua&quot; (coatis), and one leading to &quot;Bassariscus&quot; (the ring-tailed cat and the cacomistle) plus &quot;Procyon&quot; (racoons), appeared subsequently and radiated during the Miocene (). Kinkajous are thought to have evolved in North America and invaded South America as part of the Great American Interchange that followed the formation of the Isthmus of Panama. The phylogenetic relationships obtained in the 2007 study are given below; these were supported by similar studies in the following years.

== Physical characteristics ==


The kinkajou has a round head, large eyes, a short, pointed snout, short limbs, and a long prehensile tail. The total head-and-body length (including the tail) is between , and the tail measures . Its mature weight ranges from . Females are generally smaller than males. The short, rounded ears measure . The eyes reflect green or bright yellow against light. The long, thick tongue is highly extrudable. The snout is dark brown to black. The claws are sharp and short.

The coat color varies throughout the range and at different times of the year. Several shades such as tawny olive, wood brown, and yellowish tawny have been reported for the upper part of the coat and the upper side of the tail, while the underparts and the lower side of the tail have been observed to be buff, tawny, or brownish yellow. Some individuals have a black stripe running along the midline of the back. The color seems to become lighter from the south to the north, though no seasonal trends have been observed. The fur is short, woolly and dense. Hairs are of two types - light yellowish and darker with brown tips. The darker hairs reflect light poorly relative to the lighter ones, often creating an illusion of spots and dark lines on the coat. The tail is covered with thick fur up to the end.

The kinkajou is distinguished from other procyonids by its small, rounded ears, extensible tongue, and prehensile tail. Olingos are similar enough in appearance that many native cultures do not distinguish the two. Compared to olingos, kinkajous are larger, have foreshortened muzzles, and lack anal scent glands (in addition to the previously described differences). The binturong, a Southeast Asian viverrid, has similar limb proportions and is the only other carnivoran with a prehensile tail. The kinkajou resembles neotropical monkeys in having a prehensile tail and big, forward-facing eyes, but has a different dentition and heavy fur on the soles of the feet.

== Range and habitat ==

Kinkajous range from east and south of the Sierra Madre in Mexico, throughout Central America to Bolivia east of the Andes and the Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil. Their altitudinal range is from sea level to 2,500 m. They are found in closed-canopy tropical forests, including lowland rainforest, montane forest, dry forest, gallery forest, and secondary forest. Deforestation is thus a potential threat to the species.

== Diet ==

Although the kinkajou is classified in the order Carnivora and has sharp teeth, its omnivorous diet consists mainly of fruit, particularly figs. Some 90% of their diet consists of (primarily ripe) fruit. To eat softer fruits, they hold it with their forepaws, then scoop out the succulent pulp with their tongue. They may play an important role in seed dispersal. Leaves, flowers, nectar, and various herbs make up much of the other 10% of their diet. They sometimes eat insects, particularly ants. They may occasionally eat bird eggs and small vertebrates. Their frugivorous habits are actually convergent with those of (diurnal) spider monkeys.

The kinkajou&#x27;s slender 5-inch extrudable tongue helps the animal to obtain fruit and to lick nectar from flowers, so it sometimes acts as a pollinator. (Nectar is also sometimes obtained by eating entire flowers.) Although captive specimens avidly eat honey (hence the name &quot;honey bear&quot;), honey in the diet of wild kinkajous is not well reported.

== Behavior ==
Kinkajou spend most of their lives in trees, to which they are particularly well adapted. Like raccoons, kinkajous&#x27; remarkable manipulatory abilities rival those of primates. The kinkajou has a short-haired, fully prehensile tail (like some New World monkeys), which it uses as a &quot;fifth hand&quot; in climbing. It does not use its tail for grasping food. It can rotate its ankles and feet 180°, making it easy for the animal to run backward over tree limbs and climb down trees headfirst. Scent glands near the mouth, on the throat, and on the belly allow kinkajous to mark their territory and their travel routes. Kinkajous sleep in family units and groom one another.

While they are usually solitary when foraging, they occasionally forage in large groups, and sometimes associate with olingos (which are also nocturnal arboreal frugivores). The larger kinkajous are dominant and will drive olingos away when food is scarce. Kinkajous have a much more extensive range than olingos and tend to be more common. However, olingos may have greater agility, perhaps facilitating their sympatry with kinkajous.

As a nocturnal animal, the kinkajou&#x27;s peak activity is usually between about 7:00 pm and midnight, and again an hour before dawn. During daylight hours, kinkajous sleep in tree hollows or in shaded tangles of leaves, avoiding direct sunlight.

Kinkajous breed throughout the year, giving birth to one or occasionally two small babies after a gestation period of 112 to 118 days.

== As pets ==
Kinkajous are sometimes kept as exotic pets. They are playful, generally quiet, docile, and have little odor, but they can occasionally be aggressive. Kinkajous dislike sudden movements, noise, and being awake during the day. An agitated kinkajou may emit a scream and attack, usually clawing its victim and sometimes biting deeply. In 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that pet kinkajous in the United States can be carriers (fecal–oral route) of the raccoon roundworm &quot;Baylisascaris procyonis&quot;, which is capable of causing severe morbidity and even death in humans if the brain is infected. In 2023, National Geographic reported that escaped kinkajou pets were living in Florida.

In El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, pet kinkajous are commonly called &quot;micoleón&quot;, meaning &quot;lion monkey&quot;. In Peru, pet kinkajous are frequently referred to as &quot;lirón&quot; (the Spanish word for dormice), often described as a &quot;bear-monkey&quot;. These names reflect its monkey-like body and obviously carnivoran head.

They typically live about 23 years in captivity, with a maximum recorded lifespan of 42 years.

<text>Max Ehrmann (September 26, 1872 – September 9, 1945) was an American writer, poet, and attorney from Terre Haute, Indiana, widely known for his 1927 prose poem &quot;Desiderata&quot; (Latin: &quot;things desired&quot;). He often wrote on spiritual themes.

==Education==
Ehrmann was of German descent; both his parents emigrated from Bavaria to the United States in the 1840s. Young Ehrmann was educated at the Terre Haute Fourth District School and the German Methodist Church.

He received a degree in English from DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana, which he attended from 1890 to 1894. While there, he was a member of Delta Tau Delta&#x27;s Beta Beta chapter and was editor of the school newspaper, &quot;Depauw Weekly&quot;.

Ehrmann then studied philosophy and law at Harvard University, where he was editor of Delta Tau Delta&#x27;s national magazine &quot;The Rainbow&quot;, circa 1896.

==Professional life==
Ehrmann returned to his hometown of Terre Haute, Indiana, in 1898 to practice law. He was a deputy state&#x27;s attorney in Vigo County, Indiana, for two years. Subsequently, he worked in his family&#x27;s meatpacking business and in the overalls manufacturing industry (Ehrmann Manufacturing Co.) At age 40, Ehrmann left the business to write. At age 55, he wrote &quot;Desiderata&quot;, which achieved fame only after his death.

==Legacy==
Ehrmann was awarded Doctor of Letters honorary degree from DePauw University in about 1937. He was also elected to the Delta Tau Delta Distinguished Service Chapter, the fraternity&#x27;s highest alumni award.

Ehrmann died in 1945 and is buried in Highland Lawn Cemetery in Terre Haute, Indiana.

In 2010 the city honored Ehrmann with a life-size bronze statue by sculptor Bill Wolfe. He is depicted sitting on a downtown bench, pen in hand, with a notebook in his lap. &quot;Desiderata&quot; is engraved on a plaque next to the statue and lines from the poem are embedded in the walkway. The sculpture is in the collection of Art Spaces, Inc. – Wabash Valley Outdoor Sculpture Collection. Art Spaces also holds an annual Max Ehrmann Poetry Competition.

<text>Christopher Kimball (born June 5, 1951) is an American editor, publisher, and radio and TV personality. He is notable as one of the founders of &quot;America&#x27;s Test Kitchen&quot; and &quot;Cook&#x27;s Country&quot; and as the creator of &quot;Christopher Kimball&#x27;s Milk Street&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Kimball was born and raised in Westchester County, New York, the son of Mary Alice White and Edward Norris Kimball. The family had a cabin in southwestern Vermont.

He graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy and then Columbia University (1973) with a degree in Primitive Art.

== Career ==
=== Early career ===
After graduating from Columbia, Kimball worked with his stepbrother in a publishing company. Soon after, he worked for The Center for Direct Marketing in Westport, Connecticut and also started taking cooking courses. In 1980, after securing $100,000 in angel investments from friends and family, he started &quot;Cook’s Magazine&quot; out of an office in Weston, Connecticut. He sold the magazine to the Bonnier Group in 1989.

===&quot;America&#x27;s Test Kitchen&quot;===
Kimball was a co-founder, as well as editor and publisher of America&#x27;s Test Kitchen, which produces television and radio shows, and publishes magazines, including &quot;Cook&#x27;s Illustrated&quot;, which Kimball launched in 1992. It also publishes &quot;Cook&#x27;s Country&quot; magazine, which was launched in 2004. The company&#x27;s revenue comes from its readers, rather than advertisers, which differentiates it from the competitors.

Its cookbook publisher division is Two Pigs Farm. Boston Common Press, a private partnership between Kimball, Eliot Wadsworth II, and George P. Denny III, owned Kimball&#x27;s publishing activities. Kimball also hosted the syndicated public television cooking shows &quot;America&#x27;s Test Kitchen&quot; and &quot;Cook&#x27;s Country from America&#x27;s Test Kitchen&quot;.

On November 16, 2015, a news release from Boston Common Press, parent company of Cooks Country/Cooks Illustrated/America&#x27;s Test Kitchen, announced Kimball&#x27;s departure. The 2016 TV programs had already been filmed and Kimball appeared as host, but his direct participation in the company ended immediately.

===&quot;Christopher Kimball&#x27;s Milk Street&quot;===

In 2016, Kimball created &quot;Christopher Kimball&#x27;s Milk Street&quot;, located on Milk Street in Boston, Massachusetts. On October 31, 2016, Boston Common Press (the parent company &quot;of America&#x27;s Test Kitchen&quot; and &quot;Cook&#x27;s Illustrated&quot;) filed a lawsuit against Kimball in Suffolk Superior Court, claiming that Kimball &quot;literally and conceptually ripped off&quot; his former employer. In the lawsuit, Boston Common Press claims Kimball built his new venture while still on their payroll, using company resources in the form of recipes and databases to help shape &quot;Milk Street Kitchen&quot; into a direct competitor. The lawsuit was settled in August 2019. As part of the settlement, Kimball sold his remaining ATK stock back to the company.

He was further sued by his ex-wife Adrienne who alleged his departure from &quot;Cook&#x27;s Illustrated&quot; devalued the company and affected his payments to her.

=== Other ===

He is the author of &quot;The Cook&#x27;s Bible&quot;, &quot;The Yellow Farmhouse Cookbook&quot;, &quot;Dear Charlie&quot;, &quot;The Dessert Bible&quot;, and &quot;Fannie&#x27;s Last Supper&quot;, and is a columnist for the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; and the Boston-based Tab Communications.

His other television appearances include &quot;This Old House&quot; and the morning shows &quot;Weekend Today&quot; and &quot;The Early Show&quot;.

He has been a regular contributor on National Public Radio. On January 8, 2011, Kimball began hosting WGBH-FM&#x27;s &quot;America&#x27;s Test Kitchen Radio&quot; distributed by PRX. In 2015, when he left the America&#x27;s Test Kitchen TV shows, his association with the radio program also ended. He began hosting a new weekly radio cooking show in 2016, &quot;Milk Street Radio&quot;, also heard on WGBH-FM in Boston, airing Sundays at 3 p.m., and syndicated to other US public radio stations.

== Personal life ==
He has been married three times. He has a son and three daughters with his second wife, Adrienne. They divorced in December 2012.

On June 30, 2013, Kimball married Melissa Lee Baldino, executive producer of the &quot;America&#x27;s Test Kitchen&quot; television show. She is now co-founder of &quot;Christopher Kimball&#x27;s Milk Street&quot;. Their son, Oliver Kimball, was born on May 4, 2017. A daughter, Rike, was born in 2019.

<doc id="334898" wikidata="Q909799" url="?curid=334898" title="Shanidar Cave">
<text>Shanidar Cave (, ) is an archaeological site on Bradost Mountain, within the Zagros Mountains in the Erbil Governorate of Kurdistan Region in northern Iraq. 
Neanderthal remains were discovered here in 1953, including Shanidar 1, who survived several injuries, possibly due to care from others in his group, and Shanidar 4, the famed &#x27;flower burial&#x27;. Until this discovery, Cro-Magnons, the earliest known &quot;H. sapiens&quot; in Europe, were the only individuals known for purposeful, ritualistic burials.

==Archaeology==
The site, from the Great Zab river and near Rowanduz, lies at above sea level. The cave entrance is triangular, wide by high. Its dimensions are, at maximum, wide, wide, and deep.

Anthropologist Ralph Solecki, part of the University of Michigan Expedition to justify the Near East, first explored the site with a sounding in 1951. He returned in 1953, under the auspices of the Directorate General of Antiquities of Iraq and the Smithsonian Institution, for another sounding. The first human body, Mousterian age, possibly Neanderthal, infant, was found. The next season, in 1956–57, conducted soundings at two nearby village sites and continued work at the Shanidar Cave. Three Neanderthal unfossilized skeletons were found at the cave. One was nearly complete (Shanidar I - field catalog no. 504 III), one was fragmentary (Shanidar III - field catalog no. 384 III), and for one only the skull was excavated at that time (Shanidar II - field catalog no. 618 III). Two Neolithic skeletons were also recovered, an infant and female teenager (with grave goods). Frequent use of explosives, up to eight sticks at a time, were employed in these excavations.

During the fourth season, in 1960, a largely complete adult Neanderthal skeleton was recovered (Shanidar IV). Its state was considerably more fragile than the earlier specimens. While extracting it bones of another Neanderthal, possibly two, were noted and tentatively designated Shanidar VI. The former was presumed male and the later female based on size. The badly damaged and scattered remains of one adult Neanderthal male was designated Shanidar V. After the field material had been processed and analyzed more Neanderthal remains were declared. Shanidar 9 was an infant represented only by vertebrae. The remains of Shanidar 9 were discovered in the removal of Shanidar 4 when encasing it in sediment block and transporting it to the Baghdad Museum. Shanidar 8 was an adult with partial fragmentary skeleton. Shanidar 6 and 7 were skull, teeth and partial skeleton, all fragmentary. Shanidar 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 were found as individual burials while the other remains were found in a single compressed block.Overall these excavations found the remains of seven adult and two infants Neanderthals, dating from around 65,000–35,000 years ago. These individuals were uncovered amongst a Mousterian layer (layer D), overlaid by a Baradostian culture layer (layer C), a Mesolithic Zarzian layer (layer B) and a Holocene Neolithic layer (layer A), accompanied by various stone tools and animal remains. The cave also contains two later proto-Neolithic cemeteries, one of which dates back about 10,600 BCE and contains 35 individuals, and is considered by Solecki to belong to the Natufian culture. Also, in 2018, Shanidar-11 and Shanidar-12 were discovered.

===Recent work===

Investigations were conducted in 2014-2015 under the auspices of the Kurdistan Directorate of Antiquities. The remains found in the Shanidar cave are being reexamined to analyze the mortuary activity of the Neanderthal people who inhabited this area. There are various signs of activity with the remains after death being that the position of the skull and mandible of Shanidar 1 were not natural. Examinations of other sites will be integral in understanding and analyzing the activity of the remains after death of those found in the Shanidar cave. Additional work is being conducted on the faunal remains found in Layer D at the University of Chicago to analyze butchery activity. Many remains found had cut marks that where caused by flint items which correlates to butchery practices.

== Neanderthal remains ==
The ten Neanderthals at the site were found within a Mousterian layer which also contained hundreds of stone tools including points, side-scrapers, and flakes and bones from animals including wild goats and spur-thighed tortoises.

The first nine (Shanidar 1–9) were unearthed between 1957 and 1961 by Ralph Solecki and a team from Columbia University. The skeleton of Shanidar 3 is held at the Smithsonian Institution. The others (Shanidar 1, 2, and 4–8) were kept in Iraq and may have been lost during the 2003 invasion, although casts remain at the Smithsonian. In 2006, while sorting a collection of faunal bones from the site at the Smithsonian, Melinda Zeder discovered leg and foot bones from a tenth Neanderthal, now known as Shanidar 10.

=== Shanidar 1 ===

Shanidar 1 was an elderly Neanderthal male known as &#x27;Nandy&#x27; to his excavators. He was aged between 30 and 45 years. Shanidar 1 had a cranial capacity of 1,600 cm3, was around the height of , and displayed severe signs of deformity. He was one of four reasonably complete skeletons from the cave which displayed trauma-related abnormalities, which in his case would have been debilitating to the point of making day-to-day life painful.

During the course of the individual&#x27;s life, he had suffered a violent blow to the left side of his face, creating a crushing fracture to his left orbit which would have left him partially or totally blind in one eye. Research by Ján Lietava shows that the individual exhibits &quot;atypically worn teeth&quot;. Severe changes to the individual&#x27;s incisors and a flattened capitulum show additional evidence towards Shanidar 1 suffering from a degenerative disease. Additionally, analysis shows that Shanidar 1 likely suffered from profound hearing loss, as his left ear canal was partially blocked and his right ear canal was completely blocked by exostoses. He also suffered from a withered right arm which had been fractured in several places. A fracture of the individual&#x27;s C5 vertebrae is thought to have caused damage to his muscle function (specifically the deltoids and biceps) of the right arm. Shanidar 1 healed, but this caused the loss of his lower arm and hand. This is thought to be either congenital, a result of childhood disease and trauma, or due to an amputation later in his life. The sharp point caused by a distal fracture of the individual&#x27;s right humerus points towards this theory of amputation. If the arm was amputated, this demonstrates one of the earliest signs of surgery on a living individual. The arm had healed, but the injury may have caused some paralysis down his right side, leading to deformities in his lower legs and feet. Studies show that this individual had suffered from two broken legs. This would have resulted in him walking with a pronounced, painful limp. These findings in Shanidar 1&#x27;s skeleton propose that he was unlikely to be able to provide for himself in a Neanderthal society.

More recent analysis of Shanidar 1 by Washington University Professor Erik Trinkaus and Dr. Sébastien Villotte of the French National Centre for Scientific Research confirm that bony growths in his ear canals would have resulted in extensive hearing loss. These bony growths support a diagnosis of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), also known as Forestier&#x27;s disease. This diagnosis would make Shanidar 1 the oldest hominin specimen clearly presenting this systemic condition. The researchers found these bone growths in multiple places all over the partial skeleton.

Based on the healing of his injuries, Shanidar 1 lived with them for a substantial time before his death. Assuming that Neanderthals did perform surgery on Shanidar 1, his recovery demonstrates that their methods were successful in sustaining life. The prolonged survival of an individual with significant disabilities has also provided the basis for conjecture about Neanderthal social behavior. According to paleoanthropologist Erik Trinkaus, Shanidar 1 must have been aided by others in order to survive his injuries. Due to the chronic effects of trauma, it was unlikely that this individual could independently provide for his family, so his post-injury lifespan may imply that he was kept alive due to his high social status or valuable cultural knowledge.

This evidence has also led to speculation about Neanderthals&#x27; capacity for altruistic behavior and the presence of ethos in the Neanderthal communities. The discovery of stone tools found in proximity to these individuals demonstrates that Neanderthals exhibited the intelligence to make everyday life easier for themselves, and their cognitive ability may have surpassed basic comprehension to include characteristics such as humility and compassion commonly associated with &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;. These individuals may have exhibited empathy or attached abstract meaning to life that caused them to want to help Shanidar 1.

=== Shanidar 2 ===

Shanidar 2 was a Neanderthal male around the age of 30 who suffered from slight arthritis, found lying on his right side. It is estimated that Shanidar 2 was in stature, which places him just below the average height of a male Neanderthal. He was killed by rocks falling from the cave&#x27;s ceiling, which crushed his skull and bones significantly. The skull had been compressed by about . Much of his bones were missing when discovered, and the left tibia had teeth marks. Scavengers likely disposed of parts of his remains. There is evidence that Shanidar 2 was given a ritual send-off: a small pile of stones with some worked stone points (made out of chert) were found on top of his grave. Also, there had been a large fire by the burial site.

Shanidar 2 had a &quot;higher cranial vault&quot;, and other skull proportions that did not quite match up to the average Neanderthal skull. This may prove that the Neanderthals of Shanidar had more of a &quot;morphology of anatomically modern humans&quot; than other Neanderthals, or that the group was very diverse. This points to similarities between the two species, Neanderthals and Homo sapiens, but it does not show any inherited &quot;relationships within that species&quot;.

=== Shanidar 3 ===

Shanidar 3 was a 40- to 50-year-old male, found in the same grave as Shanidar 1 and 2. A wound to the left 9th rib suggests that the individual died of complications from a stab wound by a sharp implement. Bone growth around the wound indicates that Shanidar 3 lived for at least several weeks after the injury with the object still embedded. The angle of the wound rules out self-infliction, but is consistent with an accidental or purposeful stabbing by another individual. Recent research has suggested that the injury may have been caused by a long range projectile. This would be the earliest example of inter-personal or inter-specific violence in the human fossil record and the only such example amongst Neanderthals. The presence of early-modern humans, possibly armed with projectile weapons, in western Asia around the same time has been taken to imply that this injury may have resulted from inter-species conflict. However, spears produced by Neanderthals 300,000-400,000 years BP were likely used as projectiles. Shanidar 3 also suffered from a degenerative joint disorder in his foot resulting from a fracture or sprain, which would have resulted in painful, limited movement. The skeleton is on display at the Hall of Human Origins at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C.

=== Shanidar 4, the &quot;flower burial&quot;===

The skeleton of Shanidar 4, an adult male aged 30–45 years, was discovered by Solecki in 1960, positioned on his left side in a partial fetal position.

For many years, Shanidar 4 was thought to provide strong evidence for a Neanderthal burial ritual. Routine soil samples from around the body, gathered for pollen analysis in an attempt to reconstruct the palaeoclimate and vegetational history of the site, were analysed eight years after its discovery. In two of the soil samples in particular, whole clumps of pollen were discovered by Arlette Leroi-Gourhan in addition to the usual pollen found throughout the site, suggesting that entire flowering plants (or at least heads of plants) had been part of the grave deposit. Furthermore, a study of the particular flower types suggested that the flowers may have been chosen for their specific medicinal properties. Yarrow, cornflower, bachelor&#x27;s button, St Barnaby&#x27;s thistle, ragwort, grape hyacinth, horsetail and hollyhock were represented in the pollen samples, all of which have been traditionally used, as diuretics, stimulants, and astringents and anti-inflammatories. This led to the idea that the man could possibly have had shamanic powers, perhaps acting as medicine man to the Shanidar Neanderthals.

However, recent work has suggested that the pollen was perhaps introduced to the burial by animal action, as several burrows of a gerbil-like rodent known as the Persian jird were found nearby. The jird is known to store large numbers of seeds and flowers at certain points in their burrows and this argument was used in conjunction with the lack of ritual treatment of the rest of the skeletons in the cave to suggest that the Shanidar 4 burial had natural, not cultural, origins. Paul B. Pettitt has stated that the &quot;deliberate placement of flowers has now been convincingly eliminated&quot;, noting that &quot;A recent examination of the microfauna from the strata into which the grave was cut suggests that the pollen was deposited by the burrowing rodent &quot;Meriones persicus&quot;, which is common in the Shanidar microfauna and whose burrowing activity can be observed today&quot;. Despite his conclusions that flowers were unlikely to have been deliberately placed, Petitt nevertheless concludes that the Shanidar burials, because they happened over so many years, represent a deliberate mortuary practice by Neanderthals. It has also been suggested that some of the pollen was deposited by nesting solitary bees.

===Shanidar 5===

The Shanidar 5 remains were found during the 1960 excavations, in layer D, about 4.5 meters below datum. He was an adult Neanderthal, thought to be male and around 40–50 years of age before death. He was caught in the same rockfall that killed Shanidar 2. Recovered were a cranium, 4 teeth, 1 vertebrae, 8 ribs, and miscellaneous other bones. The arrangement of the broken skeletal remains was thought to have been due to animals intervening after death. Radiocarbon results put the date at about 46,000 before the present day. Some years later a small correction to the original cranial reconstruction was found. During the recent excavations more pieces of Shanidar 5 were found

The cranium of Shanidar 5 was reconstructed by Erik Trinkaus and his colleagues beginning 1976 and was finalized in 1994 after correcting a couple of errors caught in the process. During the process of reconstruction, there were discussions suggesting signs of intentional cranial deformation. Erik Trinkaus suggested that Shanidar 5 had its cranium deformed intentionally as an infant. However, this implication was overruled due to the fact that the curve was missing after the correction of a misplaced cranium bone fragment. Still, the frontal mid sagittal angle of this individual was very flat at 147º. The cranium shows signs of endocranial hyperostosis where plaques are found in the left and right side of the frontal crest and in the front area of sagittal sinus.

=== Shanidar Z ===
In February 2020, researchers announced the discovery of more Neanderthal remains, which dated back to more than 70,000 years ago.

=== Diets discovered ===
Land snails were excavated and discovered in significant amounts and thought to be part of the Shanidar diet. It is unclear whether this diet was caused from cultural change or a change in the environment that lead to changes in previous foods as seen in the analysis of size decrease in goats. However, there are other lineages from Africa that share this diet and was culturally motivated which may indicate that the Neanderthals in the Shanidar cave may have possibly changed their diet for cultural reasons. In Layer B, dating back to approximately 12,000 years ago, Ralph S. Solecki found numerous snail shells which may indicate the Shanidar maintained this diet for some time.

<text>The Fergana Valley is a valley in Central Asia, lying mostly in eastern Uzbekistan, extending into southern Kyrgyzstan and northern Tajikistan.

Encompassing three former Soviet republics, the valley is ethnically diverse and relations among the countries are tense. Ethnic enclaves of Uzbeks in Kyrgyz sovereign territory, restricted right of movement, lack of agreement about border demarcation and disputes over access to family members and places of economic activity contribute to tension at the borders.

Located in an arid region, the Fergana valley owes its fertility to two rivers, the Naryn and the Kara Darya, which run from the east, joining near Namangan, forming the Syr Darya river. The valley&#x27;s history stretches back over 2,300 years, when Alexander the Great founded Alexandria Eschate at its southwestern end.

Chinese chroniclers date its towns to more than 2,100 years ago, as a path between Greek, Chinese, Bactrian and Parthian civilisations. It was home to Babur, founder of the Mughal dynasty, tying the region to modern Afghanistan and South Asia. The Russian Empire conquered the valley at the end of the 19th century, and it became part of the Soviet Union in the 1920s. Those three Soviet republics gained independence in 1991. The area largely remains Muslim, populated by ethnic Uzbek, Tajik and Kyrgyz people, often intermixed and not matching modern borders. Historically there have also been substantial numbers of Russian, Kashgarian, Kipchak, Bukharan Jewish and Romani minorities.

The economy centers around extensive cotton cultivation, a practice initiated by the Soviets, complemented by a diverse array of grains, fruits, and vegetables. Additionally, the region has a rich heritage in stock breeding, leatherwork, and a progressively expanding mining industry, including deposits of coal, iron, sulfur, gypsum, rock-salt, naphtha and some small known oil reserves.

== Name ==
The word &quot;Fergana&quot; ( ) is of Persian origin. The valley has been set foot on by various peoples.

==Geography and geology==
The Fergana Valley is an intermountain depression in Central Asia, between the mountain systems of the Tien Shan in the north and the Alay in the south. The valley is approximately long and up to wide, forming an area covering . Its position makes it a separate geographic zone. The valley owes its fertility to two rivers, the Naryn and the Kara Darya, which unite in the valley, near Namangan, to form the Syr Darya. Numerous other tributaries of these rivers exist in the valley including the Sokh River. The streams, and their numerous mountain effluents, not only supply water for irrigation, but also bring down vast quantities of sand, which is deposited alongside their courses, more especially alongside the Syr Darya where it cuts its way through the Khujand-Ajar ridge and forms the valley. This expanse of quicksand, covering an area of , under the influence of south-west winds, encroaches upon the agricultural districts.

The central part of the geological depression that forms the valley is characterized by block subsidence, originally to depths estimated at , largely filled with sediments that range in age as far back as the Permian-Triassic boundary. Some of the sediments are marine carbonates and clays. The faults are upthrusts and overthrusts. Anticlines associated with these faults form traps for petroleum and natural gas, which has been discovered in 52 small fields.
== Paleontology ==
In the south of the valley, in the spurs of the Turkestan ridge, there is the Madygen fossil locality, in which more than 15 thousand fossils of Triassic plants (Ginkgoales, cycads, ferns, Neocalamitaceae) and animals (insects, crustaceans, fishes, amphibians) were discovered. The most numerous are insect fossils which include the large &quot;Gigatitan&quot; from the extinct order Titanoptera with a wingspan over 20 cm. Unusual small reptiles, &quot;Longisquama&quot; with long scales, and &quot;Sharovipteryx&quot;, which glided using a membrane stretched between their paws, were also found here.

==Climate==
The climate of this valley is dry and continental, being mostly a cool arid climate (Köppen &quot;BWk&quot;) or a cool semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;) in less shielded areas. In March the temperature reaches , and then rapidly rises to in June, July and August. During the five months following April precipitation is rare, but increases in frequency starting in October. Snow and frost, down to , occurs in December and January.

==History==

Fergana, on the route to Tarim Basin from the west, remained at the boundaries of a number of classical era empires.

===Achaemenid Empire===

As early as 500 BC, the western sections of the Fergana Valley formed part of the Sogdiana region, which was ruled from further west and owed fealty to the Achaemenid Empire at the time of Darius the Great. The independent and warlike Sogdiana formed a border region insulating the Achaemenid Persians from the nomadic Scythians to the north and east. It was forcibly settled by exiled Greeks from the Anatolian coast, who had rebelled or otherwise given Persia trouble. Eventually, it had a significant Greek community. The capital of the region was known to the Greeks as Cyropolis, named after Cyrus the Great.

The Sogdian Rock or Rock of Ariamazes, a fortress in Sogdiana, was captured in 327 BC by the forces of Alexander the Great; after an extended campaign putting down Sogdian resistance and founding military outposts manned by his Greek veterans, Alexander united Sogdiana with Bactria into one satrapy.

===Hellenistic settlement===


In 329 BC, Alexander the Great founded the city of Alexandria Eschate &quot;The Furthest&quot;, probably renaming Cyropolis. This was in the southwestern part of the Fergana Valley, on the southern bank of the river Syr Darya (ancient Jaxartes), at the location of the modern city of Khujand, in the state of Tajikistan. Supplemented by Alexander&#x27;s veterans, it was later ruled by Seleucids before secession of Bactria.

The Hellenistic settlements, such as Alexandria Eschate, serve as vibrant examples of cultural and artistic exchanges that occurred following Alexander the Great&#x27;s conquests. Among the artifacts that highlight this fusion is the Ferghana horse sculpture from the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, dating back to around 4 to 1 BCE.

The Ferghana horse sculpture, a ceremonial gilt bronze finial from the 4th-1st century BCE, exemplifies the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom&#x27;s artistic synthesis of Greek and Scythian influences. Capturing a horse in the suspension phase of a gallop, the sculpture symbolizes peak speed and power, with its V-shaped leg arrangement echoing Greek symbols of speed and victory. Detailed anatomical features, such as visible ribs and dynamic muscle contractions, showcase a profound understanding of equine biomechanics. The lifelike depiction extends to aerodynamic adaptations like flat ears, a streamlined mane, and a fanned tail, enhancing balance and stability at high speeds. Decorative swirls symbolize the horse&#x27;s power and celestial nature, reflecting the cultural reverence for horses and the era&#x27;s craftsmanship. Integrating elements of movement and triumph, this sculpture connects deeply to ancient narratives of success and achievement, offering insights into the historical and artistic context of its time.

After 250 BC, the city probably remained in contact with the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom centered on Bactria, especially when the Greco-Bactrian king Euthydemus extended his control to Sogdiana. There are indications that from Alexandria Eschate the Greco-Bactrians may have led expeditions as far as Kashgar and Ürümqi in Chinese Turkestan, leading to the first known contacts between China and the West around 220 BC. Several statuettes and representations of Greek soldiers have been found north of the Tian Shan, on the doorstep to China, and are today on display in the Xinjiang museum at Urumqi (Boardman). Of the Greco-Bactrians, the Greek historian Strabo too writes that:
The Fergana area, called Dayuan by the Chinese, remained an integral part of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom until after the time of Demetrius I of Bactria (c. 120 BC), when confronted with invasions by the Yuezhi from the east and the Sakas Scythians from the south. After 155 BC, the Yuezhi were pushed into Fergana by the alliance of the powerful Xiongnu and the neighboring Wusun from the north and east, invaded urban civilization of the Dayuan, eventually settling on the northern bank of the Oxus in the region of Transoxiana in modern-day Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, just north of the Hellenistic Greco-Bactrian Kingdom. The Greek city of Alexandria on the Oxus was apparently burnt to the ground by the Yuezhi around 145 BC. Pushed by these twin forces, the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom reoriented itself around lands in what is now Afghanistan, while the new invaders were partially assimilated into the Hellenistic culture left in Fergana Valley.

===Han dynasty===

According to the Han dynasty &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; or &quot;Shiji&quot;, based on the travels of Zhang Qian and published around 126 BC, the region of Fergana is presented as the country of the Dayuan (Ta-Yuan), possibly descendants of Greeks colonists (Dayuan may be a transliteration of &quot;Great Ionians&quot;). The area was renowned for its Heavenly Horses, which the Chinese tried to obtain from the Dayuan with little success until they waged war against them in 104 BC.

The Dayuan were identified by the Chinese as unusual in features, with a sophisticated urban civilization, similar to that of the Bactrians and Parthians: &quot;The Son of Heaven on hearing all this reasoned thus: Fergana (Dayuan) and the possessions of Bactria and Parthia are large countries, full of rare things, with a population living in fixed abodes and given to occupations somewhat identical with those of the Chinese people, but with weak armies, and placing great value on the rich produce of China&quot; (&quot;Book of the Later Han&quot;).

Agricultural activities of the Dayuan reported by Zhang Qian included cultivation of grain and grapes for wine-making. The area of Fergana was thus the theater of the first major interaction between an urbanized culture speaking Indo-European languages and the Chinese civilization, which led to the opening up the Silk Road from the 1st century BC onwards.

The Han later captured Dayuan in the Han-Dayuan war, installing a king there. Later the Han set up the Protectorate of the Western Regions

===Kushan===
The Kushan Empire formed from the same Yuezhi who had conquered the Hellenistic Fergana. The Kushan spread out in the 1st century AD from the Yuezhi confederation in the territories of ancient Bactria on either side of the middle course of the Oxus River or Amu Darya in what is now northern Afghanistan, and southern Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The Kushan conquered most of what is now northern India and Pakistan, driving east through Fergana. Kushan power also consolidated long-distance trade, linking Central Asia to both Han dynasty China and the Roman Empire in Europe.

=== Sassanid rule ===
The Kushans ruled the area as part of their larger empire until the 3rd century AD, when the Zoroastrian Persian Sassanid Empire invaded Kushan territory from the southwest. Fergana remained under shifting local and Transoxian rulers thereafter. For periods in the 4th and 5th centuries, the Sassanid Empire directly controlled Transoxiana and Fergana, led by the conquests of Shapur II and Khosrau I against the Kushans and the Hephthalite Empire.

=== Hepthalites ===
Sassanid rule of Fergana was interrupted by the Hepthalites, possibly Turkic.

=== Gokturks ===
Hepthalite rule was ended by the Gokturks in mid of 6th century. The Turkic Khaganates ruled it until the first quarter of 8th century when it was subjugated by the Tang dynasty

=== Ikhshids ===

The Kingdom of Ferghana was ruled by the Ikhshids, who submitted as vassal to the Chinese Tang between 659 and 790. It was attacked by the Tibetan Empire in 715.

The Umayyad Caliphate in 715 deposed the ruler, and installed a new king Alutar on the throne. The Chinese sent 10,000 troops under Zhang Xiaosong to Ferghana. He defeated Alutar and the Arab occupation force at Namangan and reinstalled Ikhshid on the throne.

===Muslim conquest===
During the 8th century, Fergana was the location of fierce rivalry between Tang dynasty China and the expansion of Muslim power. The Umayyads waged several wars against the Sogdian and Turkic population. They were defeated by the Turgesh who came dominated the Ferghana Valley until their defeat by Tang in 750. At the same time, the Abbasids defeated the Umayyads and sent their forces to Central Asia. This was leading to the Battle of Talas in 751, which resulted in a victory for the Abbasids and the disengagement of China from Central Asia. Two antecedent battles in 715 and 717 had seen the Chinese prevail over Arab forces. A series of Arab, Persian, and later Turkic Muslim rulers reigned over the Fergana.

===Samanid, Karakhanid and Khwarezmid rules===

The Samanid Empire, rising from the Arab Muslim conquest of Persia, pushed into what was then called Greater Khorasan, including Transoxiana and the Fergana Valley from the West. In 819, Ahmad ibn Asad—son of Asad ibn Saman—was granted authority over the city of Fergana by Caliph Al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s governor of Khorasan, Ghassan ibn &#x27;Abbad, as a reward for his support against the rebel Rafi&#x27; ibn Laith. Following the death of his brother Nuh, who ruled in Samarkand, Ahmad and another brother Yahya were given rule over the city by Abdallah, the governor of Khurasan.

By the time of Ahmad&#x27;s death in 864 or 865, he was the ruler of most of Transoxiana, Bukhara and Khwarazm. Samarkand and Fergana went to his son, Nasr I of Samanid, leading to a series of Samanid dynasty Muslim rulers of the valley. During demise of Samanids in 10th century, Fergana Valley was conquered by Karakhanids. Eastern part of Fergana later was under suzerenaity of Karakhitays. Karakhanid rule lasted till 1212, when Khwarezmshahs conquered the western part of the valley.

===Turco–Mongol rule===

Genghis Khan invaded Transoxiana and Fergana in 1219 during his conquest of Khwarazm. Before his death in 1227, he assigned the lands of Western Central Asia to his second son Chagatai, and this region became known as the Chagatai Khanate. But it was not long before Transoxian Turkic leaders ruled the area, along with most of central Asia as fiefs from the Golden Horde of the Mongol Empire. The Fergana became part of a larger Turco-Mongol empire. This Mongolian nomadic confederation known as Barlas, were remnants of the original Mongol army of Genghis Khan.

After the Mongol conquest of Central Asia, the Barlas settled in Turkistan (which then became also known as &quot;Moghulistan&quot; - &quot;Land of Mongols&quot;) and intermingled to a considerable degree with the local Turkic and Turkic-speaking population, so that at the time of Timur&#x27;s reign the Barlas had become thoroughly Turkicized in terms of language and habits. Additionally, by adopting Islam, the Central Asian Turks and Mongols also adopted the Persian literary and high culture which had dominated Central Asia since the early days of Islamic influence. Persian literature was instrumental in the assimilation of the Timurid elite to the Perso-Islamic courtly culture.

Heir to one of these confederations, Timur, founder of the Timurid dynasty, added the valley to a newly consolidated empire in the late 14th century, ruling the area from Samarkand.

Located on the Northern Silk Road, the Fergana played a significant part in the flowering of medieval Central Asian Islam. Its most famous son is Babur, heir to Timur and famous conqueror and founder of the Mughal dynasty in Medieval India. Islamic proselytizers from the Fergana Valley such as al-Firghani الفرغاني, al-Andijani الأندجاني, al-Namangani النمنگاني, al-Khojandi الخوجندي spread Islam into parts of present-day Russia, China, and India.

The Fergana valley was ruled by a series of Muslim states in the medieval period. For much of this period local and southwestern rulers divided the valley into a series of small states. From the 16th century, the Shaybanid dynasty of the Khanate of Bukhara ruled Fergana, replaced by the Janid dynasty of Bukhara in 1599. In 1709 Shaybanid emir Shahrukh of the Minglar Uzbeks declared independence from the Khanate of Bukhara, establishing a state in the eastern part of the Fergana Valley. He built a citadel to be his capital in the small town of Kokand. As the Khanate of Kokand, Kokand was capital of a territory stretching over modern eastern Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, southern Kazakhstan and all of Kyrgyzstan.

===Russian Empire===
Fergana was a province of Russian Turkestan, formed in 1876 out of the former khanate of Kokand. It was bounded by the provinces of Syr-darya in the North and Northwest, Samarkand in the West, and Zhetysu in the Northeast, by Chinese Turkestan (Kashgaria) in the East, and by Bukhara and Afghanistan in the South. Its southern limits, in the Pamirs, were fixed by an Anglo-Russian commission in 1885, from Zorkul (Victoria Lake) to the Chinese frontier; and Khignan, Roshan and Wakhan were assigned to Afghanistan in exchange for part of Darvaz (on the left bank of the Panj), which was given to Bukhara. The area amounted to some , of which are in the Pamirs.

Not all the inhabitants of the area were happy with this state of affairs. In 1898 Muhammed Ali Khalfa proclaimed a jihad against the Russians. However, after about 20 Russians had been killed, Khalfa was captured and executed. When the 1905 Revolution spread across the Russian Empire, some Jadids were active in the Fergana Valley. When the Tsarist regime extended the military draft to include Muslims, this led to a revolt which was far more widespread than that of 1898, and which was not entirely suppressed by the time of the Russian Revolution.

===Soviet Union===
In 1924, the new boundaries separating the Uzbek SSR and Kyrgyz SSR cut off the eastern end of the Fergana Valley, as well as the slopes surrounding it. This was compounded in 1928 when the Tajik ASSR became a fully-fledged republic, and the area around Khujand was made a part of it. This blocked the valley&#x27;s natural outlet and the routes to Samarkand and Bukhara, but none of these borders was of any great significance so long as Soviet rule lasted. The whole region was part of a single economy geared to cotton production on a massive scale, and the overarching political structures meant that crossing borders was not a problem.

=== Post Soviet breakup ===
With the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the establishment of independent republics, borders have been strongly enforced, though the impact of the new international borders was minor until 1998–2000. Uzbekistan regularly closes its borders with Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, strangling trade and causing immense difficulties for those who live in the region.

People in the Tajikistan city of Khujand traveling to the Tajik capital of Dushanbe, unable to take the more direct route through Uzbekistan, have to cross a high mountain pass between the two cities instead, along a terrible road. Communications between the Kyrgyzstan cities of Bishkek and Osh pass through difficult mountainous country. Ethnic tensions also flared into riots in 1990, most notably in the town of Uzgen, near Osh. There has been no further ethnic violence, and things appeared to have quieted down for several years.

However, the valley is a religiously conservative region which was particularly hard-hit by President Karimov&#x27;s secularization legislation in Uzbekistan, together with his decision to close the borders with Kyrgyzstan in 2003. This devastated the local economy by preventing the importation of cheap Chinese consumer goods. The deposition of Askar Akayev in Kyrgyzstan in April 2005, coupled with the arrest of a group of prominent local businessmen brought underlying tensions to a head in the region around Andijan and Qorasuv during the May 2005 unrest in Uzbekistan in which hundreds of protestors were killed by troops. There was violence again in 2010 in the Kyrgyz part of the valley, heated by ethnic tensions, worsening economic conditions due to the global economic crisis, and political conflict over the ouster of Kyrgyz President Kurmanbek Bakiyev in April 2010. In June 2010, about 200 people have been reported to be killed during clashes in Osh and Jalal-Abad, and 2000 more were injured. Between 100,000 and 300,000 refugees, predominantly of Uzbek ethnic origin, attempted to flee to Uzbekistan, causing a major humanitarian crisis.

The area has also been subject to informal radicalization.

==Agriculture==
In Tsarist times, out of some of cultivated land, about two thirds were under constant irrigation and the remaining third under partial irrigation. The soil was considered by the authors of the article in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition to be admirably cultivated, the principal crops having been cotton, wheat, rice, barley, maize, millet, lucerne, tobacco, vegetables and fruit. Gardening was conducted with a high degree of skill and success. Large numbers of horses, cattle and sheep were kept, and a good many camels are bred. Over were planted with vines, and some were under cotton.

Nearly were covered with forests. The government maintained a forestry farm at Marghelan, from which 120,000 to 200,000 young trees were distributed free every year amongst the inhabitants of the province. Silkworm breeding, formerly a prosperous industry, had decayed, despite the encouragement of a state farm at New Marghelan.

==Industry==
Coal, iron, sulfur, gypsum, rock-salt, and naphtha are all known to exist, but only the last two have ever been extracted in significant quantities. In the late 19th century there were a few small oil-wells in Fergana, but these no longer function. In the Tsarist period the only industrial enterprises were some seventy or eighty factories engaged in cotton cleaning. Leather, saddlery, paper and cutlery were the principal products of the domestic or cottage industries. This was not greatly added to in Soviet times, when industrialisation was concentrated in the cities of Samarkand and Bukhara.

==Trade==
Historically the Fergana Valley was an important staging-post on the Silk Road for goods and people traveling from China to the Middle East and Europe. After crossing the passes from Kashgar in Xinjiang, traders would have found welcome relief in the fertile abundance of Fergana, as well as the possibility of purchasing further high-quality silk manufactured in Margilan.

The most famous export from the region were the &#x27;blood-sweating&#x27; &quot;Heavenly Horses&quot; which captured the imagination of the Chinese during the Han dynasty, but in fact these were almost certainly bred on the Steppe, either west of Bukhara or north of Tashkent, and merely brought to Fergana for sale. In the 19th century, a considerable trade carried on with Russia: raw cotton, raw silk, tobacco, hides, sheepskins, fruit and cotton and leather goods were exported, and manufactured wares, textiles, tea and sugar were imported and in part re-exported to Kashgaria and Bukhara. The total trade of Fergana reached an annual value of nearly £3.5 million in 1911. Nowadays it suffers from the same depression that affects all trade that either originates in or has to pass through Uzbekistan. The only significant international export is cotton, although the Daewoo plant in Andijan sends cars all over Uzbekistan.

==Transport==
Until the late 19th century, Fergana, like everywhere else in Central Asia, was dependent on the camel, horse and donkey for transport, while roads were few and bad. The Russians built a &quot;trakt&quot; or post-road linking Andijan, Kokand, Margilan and Khujand with Samarkand and Tashkent in the early 1870s. A new impulse was given to trade by the extension (1898) of the Transcaspian railway into Fergana as far as Andijan, and by the opening of the Orenburg-Tashkent or Trans-Aral Railway in (1906).

Until Soviet times and the construction of the Pamir Highway from Osh to Khorog in the 1920s the routes to Kashgaria and the Pamirs were mere bridle-paths over the mountains, crossing them by lofty passes. For instance, the passes of Kara-kazyk, 4,389 m (14,400 ft) and Tenghiz-bai 3,413 m (11,200 ft), both passable all the year round, lead from Marghelan to Karateghin and the Pamirs, while Kashgar is reached via Osh and Gulcha, and then over the passes of Terek-davan, 3,720 m (12,205 ft); (open all the year round), Taldyk, 3,505 m (11,500 ft), Archat, 3,536 m (11,600 ft), and Shart-davan, 4,267 m (14,000 ft). Other passes leading out of the valley are the Jiptyk, 3,798 m (12,460 ft), S. of Kokand; the Isfairam, 3,657 m (12,000 ft), leading to the glen of the Surkhab, and the Kavuk, 3,962 m (13,000 ft), across the Alai Mountains.

The Angren-Pap railway line was completed in 2016 (together with the Kamchiq Tunnel), giving the region a direct railroad connection to the rest of Uzbekistan.

The Pap-Namangan-Andijon railway line is going to be electrified.

==Historical demography==
The information contained in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition (1911) gives the full information from the 1897 census, the only one held in the Russian Empire before 1917, and helps illuminate a situation rendered obscure by the vagaries of Soviet Nationalities policy in the 1920s and 1930s. The population numbered 1,571,243 in 1897, and of that number 707,132 were women and 286,369 were urban.

The population was estimated at 1,796,500 in 1906; two-thirds were Sarts and Uzbek. They lived mostly in the valley, while the mountain slopes above it were occupied by Kyrgyz, partly nomadic and pastoral, partly agricultural and settled. The other nations were Kashgarians, Kipchaks, Bukharan Jews and Romani. The governing class was primarily Russian, who also constituted much of the merchants and industrial working class. However, another merchant class in West Turkestan were commonly known as the &quot;Andijanis&quot;, from the town of Andijan in Fergana. The majority of the population were Muslims (1,039,115 in 1897).

The divisions revealed by the 1897 census, between a largely Tajik-speaking area around Khuhand, hill-regions populated by Kyrgyz and a settled, population in the main body of the valley, roughly reflect the borders as drawn after 1924. One exception is the town of Osh, which had a majority Uzbek population but ended up in Kyrgyzstan.

The one significant element that is missing when looking at modern accounts of the region are the Sarts. This term Sart was abolished by the Soviets as derogatory, but in fact there was a clear distinction between long-settled, Persianised Turkic peoples, speaking a form of Qarluq Turkic that is very close to Uyghur, and those who called themselves Uzbeks, who were a Kipchak tribe speaking a Turkic dialect much closer to Kazakh, who arrived in the region with Shaibani Khan in the mid-16th century. That this difference existed and was felt in Fergana is attested to in Timur Beisembiev&#x27;s recent translation of the &quot;Life of Alimqul&quot; (London, 2003). There were few Kipchak-Uzbeks in Fergana, although they had at various times held political power in the region. In 1924, however, Soviet policy decreed that all settled Turks in Central Asia would thenceforth be known as &quot;Uzbeks,&quot; (although the language chosen for the new Republic was not Kipchak but Qarluq) and the Fergana Valley is now seen as an Uzbek heartland.

==Administrative divisions==
In 1911, the province was divided into five districts, the chief towns of which were Fergana, capital of the province (8,977 inhabitants in 1897); Andijan (49,682 in 1900); Kokand (86,704 in 1900); Namangan (61,906 in 1897); and Osh (37,397 in 1900); but Old Marghelan (42,855 in 1900) and Chust (13,686 in 1897) were also towns of importance.

The Valley is now divided between Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. In Tajikistan it is part of Soghd Region or vilayat, with the capital at Khujand. In Uzbekistan it is divided between the Namangan, Andijan and Fergana viloyati, while in Kyrgyzstan it contains parts of Batken, Jalal-abad and Osh oblasts, with Osh being the main town for the southern part of the country.

Cities in the Fergana Valley include:
* Uzbekistan
** Andijan
** Fergana
** Kokand
** Namangan
*Kyrgyzstan
** Batken
** Osh
** Jalal-Abad
* Tajikistan
** Khujand

===Regions wholly or partially within the Fergana Valley===

==Border disputes==
The most complicated border negotiations in the Central Asia region involve the Fergana Valley where multiple enclaves struggle to exist. Three countries share in the tangled border region; Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan all have historic and economic claims to the region&#x27;s transport routes and natural resources. Negotiations between the three countries are often tense and are prone to conflict.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, border negotiations left substantial Uzbek populations stranded outside of Uzbekistan. In south-western Kyrgyzstan, a conflict over land between Kyrgyz and Uzbeks exploded in 1990 into large-scale ethnic violence; the violence reoccurring in 2010. By establishing political units on a mono-ethnic basis in a region where various peoples have historically lived side by side, the Soviet process of national delimitation sowed the seeds of today&#x27;s inter-ethnic tensions.

Conflicts over water have contributed to border disputes. For instance, the border between Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan in Jalal-Abad Region is kept open in a limited way to help irrigation, however inter-ethnic disputes in border regions often turn into national border disputes. Even during the summer there are border conflicts over water, as there is not enough to share.

<doc id="334907" wikidata="Q3297456" url="?curid=334907" title="Safsaf massacre">
<text>The Safsaf massacre took place on 29 October 1948, following the capture of the Palestinian Arab village of Safsaf in the Galilee by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The village was defended by the Arab Liberation Army&#x27;s Second Yarmuk Battalion.

Safsaf was the first village to fall in Operation Hiram, the aim of which, according to the IDF, was to &quot;destroy the enemy in the central Galilee &#x27;pocket,&#x27; to take control of the whole of the Galilee and to establish a defense line on the country&#x27;s northern border.&quot; The village was attacked by two platoons of armored cars and a tank company from the 7th Brigade, and a fierce battle lasted from the evening until seven o&#x27;clock the next morning.

Evidence of a massacre in which 50–70 villagers were killed by the IDF comes from several contemporaneous Israeli government sources and Arab oral history. The evidence suggests that 52 men had their hands tied, were shot and killed, and were buried in a pit. Several women reported allegations of rape by the IDF, including the rape and murder of a 14-year-old girl. At least two internal inquiries were initiated during 1948–49 by the IDF, but their reports remain classified.

==Massacre==
===Israeli accounts===
A key source are the diaries of Yosef Nachmani, a senior officer in the Haganah, who was also director of the Jewish National Fund in Eastern Galilee from 1935 until 1965. He visited Safsaf or the area around it on 6 November, accompanied by the Israeli Minority Affairs minister Bechor-Shalom Sheetrit. The men were briefed by Immanuel Friedman, a representative of the Minority Affairs ministry, who talked about &quot;the cruel acts of our soldiers.&quot; The Nachmani diary was released by the Israeli government in the early 1980s. It had been published before, but with the passages about the massacre omitted. 

On 6 November 1948, Nachmani wrote: &quot;In Safsaf, after ... the inhabitants had raised a white flag, the [soldiers] collected and separated the men and women, tied the hands of fifty-sixty &quot;fellahin&quot; [peasants] and shot and killed them and buried them in a pit. Also, they raped several women...&quot; After listing alleged atrocities in other villages—Eilaboun, Farradiyya, and Saliha—Nachmani writes: &quot;Where did they come by such a measure of cruelty, like Nazis? ... Is there no more humane way of expelling the inhabitants than by such methods?&quot;

Moshe Erem reported on the massacre to a meeting of the Mapam Political Committee but his words were removed from the minutes. According to notes of the meeting taken by Aharon Cohen, Erem spoke of: &quot;Safsaf 52 men tied together with a rope. Pushed down a well and shot. 10 killed. Women pleaded for mercy. 3 cases of rape ... A girl of 14 raped. Another four killed.&quot;

===Arab accounts===
The Israeli accounts in broad detail are supported by Arab witnesses who told their stories to historians. According to Nafez Nazzal, who interviewed survivors in Ain al-Hilweh camp in 1973, witnesses spoke of four rapes and the murder of about 70 men. Villagers said that when the attack began on the village, the militiamen were braced to defend it but were surprised by a three-pronged assault. One militiaman said later: &quot;We did not expect them to fight on three fronts. When none of the Arab armies joined the fighting, we retreated, together with the ALA volunteers to Lebanon. We left behind most of the villagers, many dead or injure...&quot;

Those left behind said that Israeli soldiers had entered Safsaf around sunrise and ordered the villagers to line up in a spot in the northern part of the village. One villager told Nazzal: &quot;As we lined up, a few Jewish soldiers ordered four girls to accompany them to carry water for the soldiers. Instead, they took them to our empty houses and raped them. About seventy of our men were blindfolded and shot to death, one after the other, in front of us. The soldiers took their bodies and threw them on the cement covering of the village&#x27;s spring and dumped sand on them.&quot; In later days, Israeli troops visited the village, telling the inhabitants that they should forget what had occurred and could stay in their homes. But they began to leave under cover of the night towards Lebanon, about four at a time, until Safsaf was empty.

<text>Operation Dekel (), was the largest offensive by Israeli forces in the north of Palestine after the first truce of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. It was carried out by the 7th Armoured Brigade led by Canadian volunteer Ben Dunkelman (called Benjamin Ben-David in Israel), a battalion from the Carmeli Brigade, and some elements from the Golani Brigade between 8–18 July. Its objective was to capture Nazareth and the Lower Galilee.

On 15 July Israeli aircraft bombed Saffuriya village and caused panic among the population; many of the villagers fled northwards toward Lebanon, others found shelter in Nazareth, leaving about 100 elderly people behind.

On the evening of 16 July, Nazareth surrendered to the Israelis after a light fight which left one Israeli dead and one wounded. The Arab Liberation Army forces in the village under the command of Fawzi al-Qawuqji retreated to the mountains in the north. In sharp contrast to the surrounding towns, the inhabitants of Nazareth were never forced to evacuate as Dunkelman refused to obey orders from Haim Laskov to evacuate them.

<text>Hittin (, transliterated &quot;Ḥiṭṭīn&quot; () or &quot;Ḥaṭṭīn&quot; ()) was a Palestinian village located west of Tiberias before it was occupied by Israel during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war when most of its original residents became refugees after being ethnically cleansed. As the site of the Battle of Hattin in 1187, in which Saladin reconquered most of Palestine from the Crusaders, it has become an Arab nationalist symbol. The shrine of Nabi Shu&#x27;ayb, venerated by the Druze and Sunni Muslims as the tomb of Jethro, is on the village land. The village was ruled by the Ottoman Empire from the 16th century until the end of World War I, when Palestine became part of the British Mandate for Palestine. On July 17 1948, the village was occupied by Israel during the nakbaa, after its residents fled out of their homes because of Nazareth&#x27;s occupation. in later years, the Moshavs Arbel and Kfar Zeitim were erected where Hittin used to be.

==History==

Hittin was located on the northern slopes of the double hill known as the &quot;Horns of Hattin.&quot; It was strategically and commercially significant due to its location overlooking the Plain of Hittin, which opens onto the coastal lowlands of the Lake Tiberias (the Sea of Galilee) to the east, and to the west is linked by mountain passes leading towards the plains of lower Galilee. These plains, with their east–west passages, served as routes for commercial caravans and military invasions throughout the ages.

===Prehistory===
Archaeological excavations near the village have yielded pottery fragments from the Pottery Neolithic and Chalcolithic period.

===Bronze Age to Byzantine period===
An Early Bronze Age wall was excavated just west of the village. The Arab village may have been built over the Canaanite town of Siddim or Ziddim (), which in the third century BCE acquired the Old Hebrew name &quot;Kfar Hittin&quot; (&quot;village of grain&quot;). It was known as &quot;Kfar Hittaya&quot; in the Roman period. In the 4th century CE, it was a Jewish rabbinical town.

===Crusader/Ayyubid and Mamluk periods===
Hittin was located near the site of the Battle of Hattin, where Saladin defeated the Crusaders in 1187. It is described as having been near the base camp of Saladin&#x27;s Ayyubid army, by Lieutenant-Colonel Claude Conder in &quot;Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem&quot; (1897).

Many prominent figures from the Islamic period in Palestine were born or buried in Hittin, according to early Arab geographers such as Yaqut al-Hamawi (1179–1229) and al-Ansari al-Dimashqi (1256–1327), who himself was called the Shaykh of Hittin. &#x27;Ali al-Dawadari, the writer, Quranic exegetist, and calligrapher, died in the village in 1302.

===Ottoman period===
In 1596, Hittin was a part of the Ottoman &quot;Nāḥiyah&quot; (, &quot;Subdistrict&quot;) of Tiberias under the &quot;Liwā’&quot; (, &quot;District&quot;) of Safed. The villagers paid taxes on wheat, barley, olives, goats and beehives. In 1646, the &quot;bulaydah&quot; (, &quot;small village&quot;) was visited by Evliya Çelebi, who described it as follows: &quot;It is a village in the territory of Safad, consisting of 200 Muslim houses. No Druzes live here. It is like a flourishing little town (&quot;bulayda&quot;) abounding with vineyards, orchards and gardens. Water and air are refreshing. A large fair is held there once a week, when ten thousand men would gather from the neighbourhood to sell and buy. It is situated in a spacious valley, bordered on both sides by low rocks. There is a mosque, a public bath and a caravanserei in it.&quot; Çelebi also reported that there was a shrine called the Teyké Mughraby, inhabited by over one hundred dervishes, which held the grave of Sheikh &#x27;Imād ed-dīn, of the family of the prophet Shu&#x27;eib, who was reputed to have lived for two hundred years.

Richard Pococke, who visited in 1727, writes that it is &quot;famous for some pleasant gardens of lemon and orange trees; and here the Turks have a mosque, to which they pay great veneration, having, as they say, a great sheik buried there, whom they call Sede Ishab, who, according to tradition (as a very learned Jew assured me) is Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses.&quot; Around this time and until the late 18th century, Hittin was a small village in the autonomous sheikhdom of Zahir al-Umar. In 1766, Zahir&#x27;s son Sa&#x27;id sought to control Hittin and nearby Tur&#x27;an, but was defeated by his father. Nonetheless, Zahir granted Sa&#x27;id both villages when he pardoned him. A map from Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of 1800 by Pierre Jacotin showed the place, named as &quot;Hattin&quot;.

Johann Ludwig Burckhardt, a Swiss traveller to Palestine around 1817, noted Hittin as a village, while in 1838 Edward Robinson described it as a small village of stone houses. William McClure Thomson, who visited in the 1850s, found &quot;gigantic&quot; hedges of cactus surrounding Hittin. He reported that visiting the local shrine was considered a cure for insanity.

In 1863 H. B. Tristram, wrote about the &quot;bright faces and bright colours&quot; he saw there, and the &quot;peculiar&quot; costumes: &quot;long tight gowns, or cassocks, of scarlet silk, with diagonal yellow stripes, and generally a bright red and blue or yellow jacket over them; while their cheeks were encircled by piastres, after Nazareth fashion, and some of the more wealthy wore necklaces of gold coins, with a doubloon for pendant in front.&quot; In 1875 Victor Guérin visited the village, mentioning in his writings that there was a local tradition that alleged that the tomb of Jethro (&quot;Neby Chaʾīb&quot;), the father-in-law of Moses, was to be found in the village.

In 1881, the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; described Hittin as a large well-built village of stone, surrounded by fruit and olive trees. It had an estimated 400-700 villagers, all Muslim, who cultivated the surrounding plain.

A population list from about 1887 showed Hattin to have about 1,350 inhabitants; 100 Jews and 1,250 Muslims. An elementary school was established in the village around 1897.

Conder writes in his &quot;Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem&quot; (1887): &quot;The place was surrounded by olives and fruit trees, and a good spring—copious and fresh—flowed on the northwest into the gorge of Wadi Hammam.&quot;

In the early 20th-century, some of the village land in the eastern part of the Arbel Valley was sold to Jewish land purchase societies. In 1910, the first Jewish village, Mitzpa, was established there.

===British Mandate===

In 1924, the second Jewish village, Kfar Hittim, was established on land purchased from Hattin.

In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the Mandatory Palestine authorities, the population of Hattin was 889; 880 Muslims and 9 Jews, increasing in the 1931 census to 931, all Muslims, in a total of 190 houses.

In 1932 Sheikh Izz ad-Din al-Qassam and the local Palestinian leadership affiliated with the Istiqlal party inaugurated a celebration on the anniversary of Saladin&#x27;s victory in Hittin. Hittin Day, held on August 27 of that year in the courtyard of a school in Haifa, was intended to be an anti-imperialist rally. It was attended by thousands of people from Palestine, Lebanon, Damascus, and Transjordan. The speeches delivered at the event centered around the independence of the Arab world and the importance of unity between Arab Muslims and Christians.

In 1945, Hittin had a population of 1,190 Muslims with a total land area of 22,764 dunams (22.764 km2), of which 22,086 dunams were Arab-owned and 147 dunams were Jewish-owned. The remaining 531 dunams were public property. Cultivable land amounted to 12,426 dunams, while uncultivated land amounted to 10,268 dunams. Of the cultivated land, 1,967 dunams consisted of plantations and irrigable land, and 10,462 dunams were devoted to cereals. The built-up area of the village was 70 dunams and it was populated entirely by Arabs.

===1948 War===
In 1948 the village &quot;mukhtar&quot; was Ahmad ´Azzam Abu Radi. According to the villagers, they did not feel threatened by their Jewish neighbours at Kfar Hittim, who had visited in November 1947 after the UN vote in favor of the United Nations Partition Plan, and assured the villagers they did not want war. There were 50 men in the village who had rifles, with 25-50 rounds of ammunition each.
The villagers grew anxious listening to Radio Amman and Radio Damascus, but remained uninvolved until June 9, when Jewish fighters attacked the neighbouring village of Lubya and were repulsed. Shortly after an Israeli armoured unit, accompanied by infantry, advanced towards the village from the direction of Mitzpa. The attack was rebuffed, but all the local ammunition was used up. On the night of July 16–17, almost all the inhabitants of the village evacuated. Many left for Sallama, between Deir Hanna and Maghar, leaving behind a few elderly people and 30-35 militiamen. On July 17, Hittin was occupied by the Golani Brigade as part of Operation Dekel. When the villagers tried to return, they were chased off. On one occasion, some men and pack animals were killed.

The villagers remained at Salamah for almost a month, but as their food-supply dwindled and their hope of returning faded, they left together for Lebanon. Some resettled in Nazareth. The Israeli government considered allowing 560 internally displaced Palestinians from Hittin and Alut to return to their villages, but the army objected to Hittin for security reasons.

===State of Israel===

In 1949 and 1950, the Jewish villages of Arbel and Kfar Zeitim were founded on the lands of Hittin. In the 1950s, the Druze community in Israel was given official custodianship over the Jethro shrine and 100 dunams of land around it. A request to build housing there for Druze soldiers was rejected. The Druze annual pilgrimage continued to be held and was officially recognized as a religious holiday by Israel in 1954.

According to Ilan Pappé, a resident of Deir Hanna unsuccessfully applied to hold a summer camp on the site of the Hittin mosque, which he hoped to restore. The land is currently used as grazing pasture by the nearby kibbutzim. According to tradition, the mosque was built by Saladin in 1187 to commemorate his victory over the Crusaders. In 2007, an Israeli-Palestinian advocacy organization, Zochrot, protested development plans that encroach on the site and threaten to &quot;swallow up the abandoned remains of the Hittin village.&quot;

==Nabi Shu&#x27;ayb shrine, the tomb of Jethro==
Ali of Herat wrote (c. 1173) that both Jethro and his wife were buried in Hittin. Yaqut al-Hamawi (1179–1229) wrote that another shrine near Arsuf that claimed to be the tomb of Shu&#x27;aib was misidentified. Sunni Muslims and Druze would make &quot;ziyarat&quot; pilgrimages to Hittin to the Tomb of Shu&#x27;ayb, and the Druze celebration at the site attracted members of their religion from other parts of the region of Syria.

==Demographics==
In 1596 Hittin had a population of 605. In the 1922 census of Palestine Hittin had a population of 889, which rose to 931 in the 1931 census. There were 190 houses that year. In 1945 the population was estimated at 1,190 Arabs. The village had a number of large and influential families; Rabah, &#x27;Azzam, Chabaytah, Sa&#x27;adah, Sha&#x27;ban, Dahabra, and Houran.

<text>This page details tank production by the United States of America during World War II.

==Light tanks==
=== Stuart series ===
By the time the United States entered the Second World War in December 1941 it had only two tank designs ready for combat: the M1 Combat Car and the M2 Light Tank. Originally both tanks only came equipped with machine guns but in 1940, the M2A4 was upgraded to a 37mm anti-tank gun. The machine gun-armed tanks were never used in combat, and only a handful of cannon-armed vehicles saw service in the Pacific; but their design formed the basis of the later M3/M5 Light Tank. The British officially called their M3s Stuarts, and often referred to them as &quot;Honeys&quot;.

Notes:
* M1 = M1 Combat Car, machine gun
* M2 = M2 Light Tank, 37 mm gun
* M3/M5 = M3 Light Tank, 37 mm gun
* M8 HMC = M8 Howitzer Motor Carriage, 75 mm M2 or M3 howitzer on M5 hull

===Other light AFVs===
The M22 Locust was specially designed to British requirements as an airmobile tank, to be delivered to the battlefield by glider. Production was delayed and by the time it entered service, it was considered obsolete.

The M24 Chaffee was intended as a replacement for the M3 and M5 series;

* Light Tank M22 Locust, 37 mm M6 gun
* Light Tank M24 Chaffee, 75 mm M6 gun
* M18 Gun Motor Carriage, also known as the Hellcat, was a tank destroyer armed with a 76 mm M1 gun

==Medium tanks and AFVs==
In 1939, the USA had manufactured 18 examples of the Medium M2 tank. This tank was never to see combat service, but its chassis and suspension were used as a basis for the Lee and Sherman tanks. Following the German invasion of France in 1940, a small number of Medium M2A1 tanks (an improved model) were manufactured for training. A better tank (which was eventually to become the Medium M3 Lee) was designed as an interim until the M4 could be produced. The M3 was ordered in large numbers by the British to a slightly different specification but by the time Lend-Lease was introduced the two variants were more alike except for the turret. Over half of M3 production would be supplied to the US&#x27;s allies - the UK and USSR.

The Lee was superseded by the Medium M4 Sherman. This originally carried a 75 mm gun; later versions of the Sherman were armed with a 76 mm gun or a 105 mm howitzer.

On the Sherman hull, the M10 and M36 tank destroyers (officially called &quot;Gun Motor Carriages&quot;) were produced.

The M7 Howitzer Motor Carriage was originally built on the M3 medium tank chassis, but later versions were built on the similar M4 tank chassis.

Notes:
* M2A1 = Medium M2A1
* M3 = Medium M3 Lee/Grant. The US version in British service was the Lee (named after General Lee); the British specification version (a different turret) was the Grant (named after General Grant).
* M4 = Medium M4 Sherman with 75 mm M3 (L/38) gun
* M4 (76) = Medium M4 Sherman with 76 mm M1-series gun
* M4 (105) = Medium M4 Sherman with 105 mm howitzer
* M10 GMC = M10 Gun Motor Carriage with 3&quot; M7 gun
* M36 GMC = M36 Gun Motor Carriage with 90 mm M1 gun
* M7 HMC = M7 Howitzer Motor Carriage, M3 (Grant) or M4 (Sherman) hull with 105 mm howitzer in forward-facing mount. Given the service name &quot;Priest&quot; by the British.
* M12 GMC = M12 Gun Motor Carriage, M3 (Grant) hull with 155 mm M1918 gun in forward-facing mount
* M30 Cargo Carrier, ammunition carrier for M12 GMC.

==Heavy tanks==
The Pershing heavy tank (named after General Pershing) was the only heavy tank used in combat by the US armed forces during World War II. An earlier design, the Heavy Tank M6, was not accepted for large scale production and only 40 were produced. Work began in early 1945 to develop a significantly heavier variant of the M26 Pershing, the T32 Heavy Tank, but after the end of the World War II, the project was cancelled and the four prototype vehicles were scrapped.

<text>A bed and breakfast (typically shortened to B&amp;B or BnB) is a small lodging establishment that offers overnight accommodation and breakfast. In addition, a B&amp;B sometimes has the hosts living in the house.

&quot;Bed and breakfast&quot; is also used to describe the level of catering included in a hotel&#x27;s room prices, as opposed to room-only, half-board, or full-board.

==International differences==
===Australia===
There are approximately 7,000 B&amp;Bs in Australia.

The B&amp;B industry in Australia generates about $132 million in annual revenue.

===China===
In China, expatriates have remodelled traditional structures in quiet picturesque rural areas and opened a few rustic boutique hotels with minimum amenities. Most patrons are foreign tourists but they are growing in popularity among Chinese domestic tourists.

===India===
In India, the government is promoting the concept of bed &amp; breakfast. The government is doing this to increase tourism, especially keeping in view the demand for hotels during the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi. They have classified B&amp;Bs into two categories: Gold B&amp;Bs, and Silver B&amp;Bs. All B&amp;Bs must be approved by the Ministry of Tourism, which will then categorize them as Gold or Silver based on a list of predefined criteria.

===Ireland===
In Ireland, B&amp;Bs can be townhouses, farmhouses, or country houses. There are about 3,000 B&amp;Bs spread throughout the country, 750 of which are certified for meeting quality standards by Fáilte Ireland.

===Israel===

The Israeli B&amp;B is known as a &quot;zimmer&quot; (German for &#x27;room&#x27;). All over the country, but especially in northern Israel (Galilee, Upper Galilee, and the Golan Heights), the &quot;zimmer&quot; has developed into an extensive industry. This industry began to develop in the 1990s, when agriculture became less profitable, and many families with farms in moshavim, kibbutzim, farms, and even in cities decided to try their luck in the business of hospitality. In the last decade, bed and breakfasts have also emerged in southern Israel&#x27;s Negev region.

===Italy===
In Italy, regional law regulates B&amp;Bs. There is a national law &quot;Legge 29 marzo 2001, n. 135&quot; but each region maintains a specific regulation. Each region can adopt different regulations but they must observe the national law on Tourism (Law N° 135 /2001).

===Japan===
The Japanese equivalent of this sort of hospitality business is the minshuku, which offers dinner as well as bed &amp; breakfast in the tradition of the ryokan.

===United Kingdom===

There are numerous B&amp;Bs found in seaside towns, the countryside as well as city centres.

B&amp;Bs are graded by VisitBritain and the AA on a star system. 3-, 4- and 5-star establishments have a higher standard. A majority of B&amp;Bs in the UK have en suite facilities.

===United States===

There are approximately 17,000 B&amp;Bs in the United States. Bed and breakfasts are often private family homes and typically have between four and eleven rooms, with six being the average.

<doc id="334940" wikidata="Q843592" url="?curid=334940" title="Automatic transmission">
<text>An automatic transmission (sometimes abbreviated AT) is a multi-speed transmission used in motor vehicles that does not require any input from the driver to change forward gears under normal driving conditions.

The 1904 Sturtevant &quot;horseless carriage gearbox&quot; is often considered to be the first true automatic transmission. The first mass-produced automatic transmission is the General Motors &quot;Hydramatic&quot; four-speed hydraulic automatic, which was introduced in 1939.

Automatic transmissions are especially prevalent in vehicular drivetrains, particularly those subject to intense mechanical acceleration and frequent idle/transient operating conditions; commonly commercial/passenger/utility vehicles, such as buses and waste collection vehicles.

==Prevalence==
Vehicles with internal combustion engines, unlike electric vehicles, require the engine to operate in a narrow range of rates of rotation, requiring a gearbox, operated manually or automatically, to drive the wheels over a wide range of speeds.

Globally, 43% of new cars produced in 2015 were manual transmissions, falling to 37% by 2020. Automatic transmissions have long been prevalent in the United States, but only started to become common in Europe much later. In Europe in 1997, only 10–12% of cars had automatic transmissions.

In 1957 over 80% of new cars in the United States had automatic transmissions. Automatic transmissions have been standard in large cars since at least 1974. By 2020 only 2.4% of new cars had manual transmissions. Historically, automatic transmissions were less efficient, but lower fuel prices in the US made this less of a problem than in Europe.

In the United Kingdom, a majority of new cars have had automatic transmissions since 2020. Several manufacturers including Mercedes and Volvo no longer sell cars with manual transmissions. The growing prevalence of automatic transmissions is attributed to the increasing number of electric and hybrid cars, and the ease of integrating it with safety systems such as Autonomous Emergency Braking.

==Efficiency==
The efficiency (power output as a percentage of input) of conventional automatic transmissions ranges from 86 to 94%. Manual transmissions are more fuel efficient than all but the newest automatic transmissions due to their inherently low parasitic losses (typically of about 4%) in addition to being cheaper to make, lighter, better performing, and of simpler mechanical design. Fuel economy worsens with lower efficiency. However, manual transmissions have the disadvantage of requiring the driver to operate the clutch and change gear whenever required.

Real-world tests reported in 2022 found that in typical driving manual transmissions achieved 2 to 5% better fuel economy than automatics, increasing to 20% with an expert driver. Some laboratory tests show automatics in a better light due to the tests using a prescribed shifting pattern for manuals not always optimized for economy. However, on long highway journeys manual transmissions require maintaining a very specific cruising speed to optimise economy, making automatics preferable.

==Hydraulic automatic transmission==
===Design===
The most common design of automatic transmissions is the hydraulic automatic, which typically uses planetary gearsets that are operated using hydraulics. The transmission is connected to the engine via a torque converter (or a fluid coupling prior to the 1960s), instead of the friction clutch used by most manual transmissions.

====Gearsets and shifting mechanism====
A hydraulic automatic transmission uses planetary gearsets instead of the manual transmission&#x27;s design of gears lined up along input, output and intermediate shafts. To change gears, the hydraulic automatic uses a combination of internal clutches, friction bands or brake packs. These devices are used to lock certain gears, thus setting which gear ratio is in use at a given time.

A sprag clutch (a ratchet-like device which can freewheel and transmits torque in only one direction) is often used for routine gear shifts. The advantage of a sprag clutch is that it eliminates the sensitivity of timing a simultaneous clutch release/apply on two planetary gearsets, simply &quot;taking up&quot; the drivetrain load when actuated, and releasing automatically when the next gear&#x27;s sprag clutch assumes the torque transfer.

The friction bands are often used for manually selected gears (such as low range or reverse) and operate on the planetary drum&#x27;s circumference. Bands are not applied when the drive/overdrive range is selected, the torque being transmitted by the sprag clutches instead.

====Hydraulic controls====
The aforementioned friction bands and clutches are controlled using automatic transmission fluid (ATF), which is pressurized by a pump and then directed to the appropriate bands/clutches to obtain the required gear ratio. The ATF provides lubrication, corrosion prevention, and a hydraulic medium to transmit the power required to operate the transmission. Made from petroleum with various refinements and additives, ATF is one of the few parts of the automatic transmission that needs routine service as the vehicle ages.

The &quot;main pump&quot; which pressurises the ATF is typically a gear pump mounted between the torque converter and the planetary gear set. The input for the main pump is connected to the torque converter housing, which in turn is bolted to the engine&#x27;s flexplate, so the pump provides pressure whenever the engine is running. A disadvantage of this arrangement is that there is no oil pressure to operate the transmission when the engine is not running, therefore it is not possible to push start a vehicle equipped with an automatic transmission with no rear pump (aside from several automatics built prior to 1970, which also included a rear pump for towing and push-starting purposes). The pressure of the ATF is regulated by a &quot;governor&quot; connected to the output shaft, which varies the pressure depending on the vehicle speed.

The &quot;valve body&quot; inside the transmission is responsible for directing hydraulic pressure to the appropriate bands and clutches. It receives pressurized fluid from the main pump and consists of several spring-loaded valves, check balls, and servo pistons. In older automatic transmissions, the valves use the pump pressure and the pressure from a centrifugal governor on the output side (as well as other inputs, such as throttle position or the driver locking out the higher gears) to control which ratio is selected. As the vehicle and engine change speed, the difference between the pressures changes, causing different sets of valves to open and close. In more recent automatic transmissions, the valves are controlled by solenoids. These solenoids are computer-controlled, with the gear selection decided by a dedicated transmission control unit (TCU) or sometimes this function is integrated into the engine control unit (ECU). Modern designs have replaced the centrifugal governor with an electronic speed sensor that is used as an input to the TCU or ECU. Modern transmissions also factor in the amount of load on an engine at any given time, which is determined from either the throttle position or the amount of intake manifold vacuum.

The multitude of parts, along with the complex design of the valve body, originally made hydraulic automatic transmissions much more expensive and time-consuming to build and repair than manual transmissions; however mass-production and developments over time have reduced this cost gap.

====Torque converter====
To provide coupling and decoupling of the engine, a modern automatic transmission uses a torque converter instead of the friction clutch used in a manual transmission.

===History===
====1904–1939: Predecessors to the hydraulic automatic====
The 1904 Sturtevant &quot;horseless carriage gearbox&quot; is often considered to be the first automatic transmission for motor vehicles. At higher engine speeds, high gear was engaged. As the vehicle slowed down and engine speed decreased, the gearbox would shift back to low. However, the transmission was prone to sudden failure, due to the transmission being unable to withstand forces from the abrupt gear changes.

The adoption of planetary gearsets was a significant advance towards the modern automatic transmission. One of the first transmissions to use this design was the manual transmission fitted to the 1901–1904 Wilson-Pilcher automobile. This transmission was built in the United Kingdom and used two epicyclic gears to provide four gear ratios. A foot clutch was used for standing starts, gear selection was using a hand lever, helical gears were used (to reduce noise) and the gears used a constant-mesh design. A planetary gearset was also used in the 1908 Ford Model T, which was fitted with a two-speed manual transmission (without helical gears).

An early patent for the automatic transmission was granted to Canadian inventor Alfred Horner Munro of Regina in 1923. Being a steam engineer, Munro designed his device to use compressed air rather than hydraulic fluid, and so it lacked power and never found commercial application.

In 1923, a patent was approved in the United States describing the operation of a transmission where the manual shifting of gears and manual operation of a clutch was eliminated. This patent was submitted by Henry R. Hoffman from Chicago and was titled: &quot;Automatic Gear Shift and Speed Control&quot;. The patent described the workings of such a transmission as &quot;...having a series of clutches disposed intermediate the engine shaft and the differential shaft and in which the clutches are arranged to selectively engage and drive the differential shaft dependent upon the speed at which the differential shaft rotates&quot;. However, it would be over a decade later until automatic transmissions were produced in significant quantities. In the meantime, several European and British manufacturers would use preselector gearboxes, a form of manual transmission which removed the reliance on the driver&#x27;s skill to achieve smooth gear shifts.

The first automatic transmission using hydraulic fluid was developed in 1932 by two Brazilian engineers, José Braz Araripe and Fernando Lehly Lemos.

The evolution towards mass-produced automatic transmissions continued with the 1933–1935 REO Motor Car Company &quot;Self-Shifter&quot; semi-automatic transmission, which automatically shifted between two forward gears in the &quot;Forward&quot; mode (or between two shorter gear ratios in the &quot;Emergency low&quot; mode). Driver involvement was still required during normal driving, since standing starts required the driver to use the clutch pedal. This was followed in 1937 by the Oldsmobile &quot;Automatic Safety Transmission&quot;. Similar in operation to the REO &quot;Self-Shifter&quot;, the &quot;Automatic Safety Transmission&quot; shifted automatically between the two gear ratios available in the &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;High&quot; ranges and the clutch pedal was required for standing starts. It used a planetary gearset. The Chrysler &quot;Fluid Drive&quot;, introduced in 1939, was an optional addition to manual transmissions where a fluid coupling (similar to a torque-convertor, but without the torque multiplication) was added, to avoid the need to operate a manual clutch.

====1939–1964: Early hydraulic automatics====
The General Motors Hydra-Matic became the first mass-produced automatic transmission following its introduction in 1939 (1940 model year). Available as an option in cars such as the Oldsmobile Series 60 and Cadillac Sixty Special, the Hydra-Matic combined a fluid coupling with three hydraulically controlled planetary gearsets to produce four forward speeds plus reverse. The transmission was sensitive to engine throttle position and road speed, producing fully automatic up- and down-shifting that varied according to operating conditions. Features of the Hydra-Matic included a wide spread of ratios (allowing both good acceleration in first gear and cruising at low engine speed in top gear) and the fluid coupling handling only a portion of the engine&#x27;s torque in the top two gears (increasing fuel economy in those gears, similar to a lock-up torque converter). Use of the Hydra-Matic spread to other General Motors brands and then to other manufacturers starting 1948 including Hudson, Lincoln, Kaiser, Nash, Holden (Australia), as well as Rolls-Royce and Bentley licensing production in the UK and providing the transmission to Jensen Motors, Armstrong Siddeley and other UK manufacturers. During World War II, the Hydra-Matic was used in some military vehicles.

The first automatic transmission to use a torque converter (instead of a fluid coupling) was the Buick Dynaflow, which was introduced for the 1948 model year. In normal driving, the Dynaflow used only the top gear, relying on the torque multiplication of the torque convertor at lower speeds. The Dynaflow was followed by the Packard Ultramatic in mid-1949 and the Chevrolet Powerglide for the 1950 model year. Each of these transmissions had only two forward speeds, relying on the converter for additional torque multiplication. In the early 1950s, BorgWarner developed a series of three-speed torque converter automatics for car manufacturers such as American Motors, Ford and Studebaker. Chrysler was late in developing its own true automatic, introducing the two-speed torque converter PowerFlite in 1953, and the three-speed TorqueFlite in 1956. The latter was the first to utilize the Simpson compound planetary gearset.

In 1956, the General Motors Hydra-Matic (which still used a fluid coupling) was redesigned based around the use of two fluid couplings to provide smoother shifts. This transmission was called the &quot;Controlled Coupling Hydra-Matic&quot;, or &quot;Jetaway&quot; transmission. The original Hydra-Matic remained in production until the mid-1960s at GM, with the licensed Rolls-Royce Automatic transmission soldiering on until 1978 on the Rolls-Royce Phantom VI. In 1964, General Motors released a new transmission, the Turbo Hydramatic, a three-speed transmission which used a torque convertor. The Turbo Hydramatic was among the first to have the basic gear selections (&quot;park&quot;, &quot;reverse&quot;, &quot;neutral&quot;, &quot;drive&quot;, &quot;low&quot;) which became the standard gear selection used for several decades.

====1965–present: increased ratio count and electronics====
By the late 1960s, most of the fluid-coupling two-speed and four-speed transmissions had disappeared in favor of three-speed units with torque converters. Also around this time, whale oil was removed from the automatic transmission fluid. During the 1980s, automatic transmissions with four gear ratios became increasingly common, and many were equipped with lock-up torque convertors in order to improve fuel economy.

Electronics began to be more commonly used to control the transmission, replacing mechanical control methods such as spring-loaded valves in the valve body. Most systems use solenoids which are controlled by either the engine control unit, or a separate transmission control unit. This allows for more precise control of shift points, shift quality, lower shift times and manual control.

The first five-speed automatic was the ZF 5HP18 transmission, debuting in 1991 on various BMW models. The first six-speed automatic was the ZF 6HP26 transmission, which debuted in the 2002 BMW 7 Series (E65). The first seven-speed automatic was the Mercedes-Benz 7G-Tronic transmission, which debuted a year later. In 2007, the first eight-speed transmission to reach production was the Toyota AA80E transmission. The first nine-speed and ten-speed transmissions were the 2013 ZF 9HP transmission and 2017 &quot;Toyota Direct Shift-10A&quot; (used in the Lexus LC) respectively.

===Gear selectors===

The gear selector is the input by which the driver selects the operating mode of an automatic transmission. Traditionally the gear selector is located between the two front seats or on the steering column, however electronic rotary dials and push-buttons have also been occasionally used since the 1980s, as well as push buttons having been used in the 1950s and 1960s by Rambler (automobile), Edsel, and most famously, by Chrysler. A few automobiles employed a lever on the instrument panel, such as the 1955 Chrysler Corporation cars, and notably, the Corvair.

====P–R–N–D–L positions====
Most cars use a &quot;P–R–N–D–L&quot; layout for the gear selector, which consists of the following positions:

* Park (&quot;P&quot;): This position disengages the transmission from the engine (as with the &quot;neutral&quot; position), and a parking pawl mechanically locks the output shaft of the transmission. This prevents the driven wheels from rotating to prevent the vehicle from moving. The use of the hand brake (&quot;parking brake&quot;) is also recommended when parking on slopes, since this provides greater protection from the vehicle moving. The &quot;park&quot; position is omitted on buses/coaches/tractors, which must instead be placed in &quot;neutral&quot; with the air-operated parking brakes set. Some early passenger car automatics, such as the pre-1960 Chrysler cars and the Corvair Powerglide, did not have the &quot;park&quot; feature at all. These cars were started in &quot;neutral&quot; and required the driver to apply a parking brake when parked. The original Hydra-Matic from GM instead engaged a parking pawl when placed in &quot;reverse&quot; with the engine off, thus dispensing with a &quot;park&quot; position until the adoption of the Controlled Coupling Hydra-Matic in 1956.&lt;br&gt;The &quot;park&quot; position usually includes a lockout function (such as a button on the side of the gear selector or requiring that the brake pedal be pressed) which prevents the transmission from being accidentally shifted from &quot;park&quot; into other gear selector positions. Many cars also prevent the engine from being started when the selector is in any position other than &quot;park&quot; or &quot;neutral&quot; (often in combination with requiring the brake pedal to be pressed).
* Reverse (&quot;R&quot;): This position engages &quot;reverse&quot; gear, so that the vehicle drives in a backwards direction. It also operates the reversing lights and on some vehicles can activate other functions including parking sensors, backup cameras and reversing beepers (to warn pedestrians).&lt;br&gt;Some modern transmissions have a mechanism that will prevent shifting into the &quot;reverse&quot; position when the vehicle is moving forward, often using a switch on the brake pedal or electronic transmission controls that monitor the vehicle speed.
* Neutral (&quot;N&quot;): This position disengages the transmission from the engine, allowing the vehicle to move regardless of the engine&#x27;s speed. Prolonged movement of the vehicle in &quot;neutral&quot; with the engine off at significant speeds (&quot;coasting&quot;) can damage some automatic transmissions, since the lubrication pump is often powered by the input side of the transmission and is therefore not running when the transmission is in &quot;neutral&quot;. The vehicle may be started in &quot;neutral&quot; as well as &quot;park&quot;.
* Drive (&quot;D&quot;): This position is the normal mode for driving forwards. It allows the transmission to engage the full range of available forward gear ratios.
*Low (&quot;L&quot;): This position provides for engine braking on steep hills. It also provides for a lower gear ratio for starting out when heavily loaded.

Some automatic transmissions, especially by General Motors from 1940 to 1964, used a layout with &quot;reverse&quot; as the bottom position (e.g. N–D–L–R or P–N–D–L–R).

====Other positions and modes====

Many transmissions also include positions to restrict the gear selection to the lower gears and engages the engine brake. These positions are often labelled &quot;L&quot; (low gear), &quot;S&quot; (second gear) or the number of the highest gear used in that position (eg 3, 2 or 1). If these positions are engaged at a time when it would result in excessive engine speed, many modern transmissions disregard the selector position and remain in the higher gear.

In descending order of the highest gear available:
* 3: Restricts the transmission to the lowest three gear ratios. In a 4-speed automatic transmission, this is often used to prevent the car shifting into the overdrive ratio. In some cars, the position labelled &quot;D&quot; performs this function, while another position labelled &quot;OD&quot; or a boxed &quot;[D]&quot; allows all gears to be used.
* 2 (also labelled &quot;S&quot;): Restricts the transmission to the lowest two gear ratios. In some cars, it is also used to accelerate from standstill in 2nd gear instead of 1st, for situations of reduced traction (such as snow or gravel). This function is sometimes called &quot;winter mode&quot;, labelled &quot;W&quot;.
* 1 (also labelled &quot;L&quot;): Restricts the transmission to 1st gear only, also known as a &quot;low gear&quot;. This is useful when a large torque is required at the wheels (for example, when accelerating up a steep incline); however use at higher speeds can run the engine at an excessive speed, risking overheating or damage.

Many modern transmissions include modes to adjust the shift logic to prefer either power or fuel economy. &quot;Sport&quot; (also called &quot;Power&quot; or &quot;Performance&quot;) modes cause gear shifts to occur at higher engine speeds, allowing higher acceleration. &quot;Economy&quot; (also called &quot;Eco&quot; or &quot;Comfort&quot;) modes cause gear shifts to occur at lower engine speeds to reduce fuel consumption.

====Manual controls====
Since the 1990s, systems to manually request a specific gear or an upshift/downshift have become more common. These &quot;manumatic&quot; transmissions offer the driver greater control over the gear selection that the traditional modes to restrict the transmission to the lower gears.

Use of the manumatic functions are typically achieved either via paddles located beside the steering column, or &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; controls on the gear selector. Some cars offer drivers both methods to request a manual gear selection.
==Continuously variable transmission (CVT)==
A &quot;continuously variable transmission&quot; (CVT) can change seamlessly through a continuous (infinite) range of gear ratios, compared with other automatic transmissions that provide a limited number of gear ratios in fixed steps. The flexibility of a CVT with suitable control may allow the engine to operate at a constant angular velocity while the vehicle moves at varying speeds.

CVTs are used in cars, tractors, UTVs, motor scooters, snowmobiles, and earthmoving equipment.

The most common type of CVT uses two pulleys connected by a belt or chain, however, several other designs have also been used.
==Dual-clutch transmission (DCT)==
A &quot;dual-clutch transmission&quot; (DCT, sometimes referred to as a &quot;twin-clutch transmission&quot;, or &quot;double-clutch transmission&quot;) uses two separate clutches for odd and even gear sets. The design is often similar to two separate manual transmissions with their respective clutches contained within one housing, and working as one unit. In most car and truck applications, the DCT functions as an automatic transmission, requiring no driver input to change gears.

The first DCT to reach production was the &quot;Easidrive&quot; automatic transmission introduced on the 1961 &quot;Hillman Minx&quot; mid-size car. This was followed by various eastern European tractors through the 1970s (using manual operation via a single clutch pedal), then the &quot;Porsche 962 C&quot; racing car in 1985. The first DCT of the modern era was used in the 2003 &quot;Volkswagen Golf R32&quot;. Since the late 2000s, DCTs have become increasingly widespread, and have supplanted hydraulic automatic transmissions in various models of cars.
==Automated manual transmission (AMT)==

&quot;Automated manual transmission (AMT)&quot;, sometimes referred to as a &quot;clutchless manual&quot;, is a type of multi-speed automobile transmission system that is closely based on the mechanical design of a conventional manual transmission, and automates either the clutch system, the gear shifting, or both simultaneously, requiring partial, or no driver input or involvement.

Earlier versions of these transmissions that are semi-automatic in operation, such as &quot;Autostick&quot;, control only the clutch system automatically — and use different forms of actuation (usually via an actuator or servo) to automate the clutch, but still require the driver&#x27;s input and full control to manually actuate gear changes by hand. Modern versions of these systems that are fully automatic in operation, such as &quot;Selespeed&quot; and &quot;Easytronic&quot;, require no driver input over gear changes or clutch operation. Semi-automatic versions require only partial driver input (i.e., the driver must change gears manually), while fully automatic versions require no manual driver input, whatsoever (TCU or ECU operates both the clutch system and gear shifts automatically).

Modern automated manual transmissions (AMT) have their roots and origins in older clutchless manual transmissions that began to appear on mass-production automobiles in the early 1930s and 1940s, prior to the introduction of hydraulic automatic transmissions. These systems were designed to reduce the amount of clutch or gear shifter usage required by the driver. These devices were intended to reduce the difficulty of operating conventional unsynchronised manual transmissions (&quot;crash gearboxes&quot;) that were commonly used at the time, especially in stop-start driving. An early example of this transmission was introduced with the Hudson Commodore in 1942, called &quot;Drive-Master&quot;. This unit was an early semi-automatic transmission, based on the design of a conventional manual transmission, which used a servo-controlled vacuum-operated clutch system, with three different gear shifting modes, at the touch of a button; manual shifting and manual clutch operation (fully manual), manual shifting with automated clutch operation (semi-automatic), and automatic shifting with automatic clutch operation (fully automatic). Another early example of this transmission system was introduced in the 1955 Citroën DS, which used a 4-speed &quot;BVH&quot; transmission. This semi-automatic transmission used an automated clutch, which was actuated using hydraulics. Gear selection also used hydraulics, however, the gear ratio needs to be manually selected by the driver. This system was nicknamed &quot;Citro-Matic&quot; in the U.S.

The first modern AMTs were introduced by BMW and Ferrari in 1997, with their &quot;SMG&quot; and &quot;F1&quot; transmissions, respectively. Both systems used hydraulic actuators and electrical solenoids, and a designated transmission control unit (TCU) for the clutch and shifting, plus steering wheel-mounted paddle shifters, if the driver wanted to change gear manually.

Modern fully automatic AMTs, such as &quot;Selespeed&quot; and &quot;Easytronic&quot;, have now been largely superseded and replaced by the increasingly widespread dual-clutch transmission design.

<text>The Web Services Business Process Execution Language (WS-BPEL), commonly known as BPEL (Business Process Execution Language), is an OASIS standard executable language for specifying actions within business processes with web services. Processes in BPEL export and import information by using web service interfaces exclusively.

==Overview==
One can describe web service interactions in two ways: as executable business processes and as abstract business processes.

# An &quot;executable business process&quot;: models an actual behavior of a participant in a business interaction. 
# An &quot;abstract business process&quot;: is a partially specified process that is not intended to be executed. Contrary to Executable Processes, an Abstract Process may hide some of the required concrete operational details. Abstract Processes serve a descriptive role, with more than one possible use case, including observable behavior and/or process template.

WS-BPEL aims to model the behavior of processes, via a language for the specification of both Executable and Abstract Business Processes. By doing so, it extends the Web Services interaction model and enables it to support business transactions. It also defines an interoperable integration model that should facilitate the expansion of automated process integration both within and between businesses. Its development came out of the notion that &quot;programming in the large&quot; and &quot;programming in the small&quot; required different types of languages.

As such, it is serialized in XML and aims to enable programming in the large.

==Programming in the large/small==

The concepts of &quot;programming in the large&quot; and &quot;programming in the small&quot; distinguish between two aspects of writing the type of long-running asynchronous processes that one typically sees in business processes:
# &quot;Programming in the large&quot; generally refers to the high-level state transition interactions of a process. BPEL refers to this concept as an Abstract Process. A BPEL Abstract Process represents a set of publicly observable behaviors in a standardized fashion. An Abstract Process includes information such as when to wait for messages, when to send messages, when to compensate for failed transactions, etc. 
# &quot;Programming in the small&quot;, in contrast, deals with short-lived programmatic behavior, often executed as a single transaction and involving access to local logic and resources such as files, databases, et cetera.

==History==
The origins of WS-BPEL go back to Web Services Flow Language (WSFL) and Xlang.

In 2001, IBM and Microsoft had each defined their own fairly similar, &quot;programming in the large&quot; languages: WSFL (&quot;Web Services Flow Language&quot;) and Xlang, respectively. Microsoft even went ahead and created a scripting variant called &quot;XLANG/s&quot; which would later serve as the basis for their Orchestrations services inside their BizTalk Server. They specifically documented that this language &quot;is proprietary and is not fully documented.&quot;

With the advent and popularity of BPML, and the growing success of &quot;BPMI.org&quot; and the open BPMS movement led by JBoss and Intalio Inc., IBM and Microsoft decided to combine these languages into a new language, BPEL4WS. In April 2003, BEA Systems, IBM, Microsoft, SAP, and Siebel Systems submitted BPEL4WS 1.1 to OASIS for standardization via the Web Services BPEL Technical Committee. Although BPEL4WS appeared as both a 1.0 and 1.1 version, the OASIS WS-BPEL technical committee voted on 14 September 2004 to name their spec &quot;WS-BPEL 2.0&quot;. (This change in name aligned BPEL with other web service standard naming conventions which start with &quot;WS-&quot; (similar to WS-Security) and took account of the significant enhancements made between BPEL4WS 1.1 and WS-BPEL 2.0.) If not discussing a specific version, the moniker BPEL is commonly used.

In June 2007, Active Endpoints, Adobe Systems, BEA, IBM, Oracle, and SAP published the BPEL4People and WS-HumanTask specifications, which describe how human interaction in BPEL processes can be implemented.

==Topics==

===Design goals===
There were ten original design goals associated with BPEL:
# Define business processes that interact with external entities through web service operations defined using Web Services Description Language (WSDL) 1.1, and that manifest themselves as Web services defined using WSDL 1.1. The interactions are &quot;abstract&quot; in the sense that the dependence is on portType definitions, not on port definitions.
# Define business processes using an XML-based language. Do not define a graphical representation of processes or provide any particular design methodology for processes.
# Define a set of Web service orchestration concepts that are meant to be used by both the external (abstract) and internal (executable) views of a business process. Such a business process defines the behavior of a single autonomous entity, typically operating in interaction with other similar peer entities. It is recognized that each usage pattern (i.e., abstract view and executable view) will require a few specialized extensions, but these extensions are to be kept to a minimum and tested against requirements such as import/export and conformance checking that link the two usage patterns.
# Provide both hierarchical and graph-like control regimes, and allow their use to be blended as seamlessly as possible. This should reduce the fragmentation of the process modeling space.
# Provide data manipulation functions for the simple manipulation of data needed to define process data and control flow.
# Support an identification mechanism for process instances that allows the definition of instance identifiers at the application message level. Instance identifiers should be defined by partners and may change.
# Support the implicit creation and termination of process instances as the basic lifecycle mechanism. Advanced lifecycle operations such as &quot;suspend&quot; and &quot;resume&quot; may be added in future releases for enhanced lifecycle management.
# Define a long-running transaction model that is based on proven techniques like compensation actions and scoping to support failure recovery for parts of long-running business processes.
# Use Web Services as the model for process decomposition and assembly.
# Build on Web services standards (approved and proposed) as much as possible in a composable and modular manner.

===The BPEL language===
BPEL is an orchestration language, and not a choreography language. The primary difference between orchestration and choreography is executability and control. An orchestration specifies an executable process that involves message exchanges with other systems, such that the message exchange sequences are controlled by the orchestration designer. A choreography specifies a protocol for peer-to-peer interactions, defining, e.g., the legal sequences of messages exchanged with the purpose of guaranteeing interoperability. Such a protocol is not directly executable, as it allows many different realizations (processes that comply with it). A choreography can be realized by writing an orchestration (e.g., in the form of a BPEL process) for each peer involved in it. The orchestration and the choreography distinctions are based on analogies: orchestration refers to the central control (by the conductor) of the behavior of a distributed system (the orchestra consisting of many players), while choreography refers to a distributed system (the dancing team) which operates according to rules (the choreography) but without centralized control.

BPEL&#x27;s focus on modern business processes, plus the histories of WSFL and XLANG, led BPEL to adopt web services as its external communication mechanism. Thus BPEL&#x27;s messaging facilities depend on the use of the Web Services Description Language (WSDL) 1.1 to describe outgoing and incoming messages.

In addition to providing facilities to enable sending and receiving messages, the BPEL programming language also supports:
* A property-based message correlation mechanism
* XML and WSDL typed variables
* An extensible language plug-in model to allow writing expressions and queries in multiple languages: BPEL supports XPath 1.0 by default
* Structured-programming constructs including if-then-elseif-else, while, sequence (to enable executing commands in order) and flow (to enable executing commands in parallel)
* A scoping system to allow the encapsulation of logic with local variables, fault-handlers, compensation-handlers and event-handlers
* Serialized scopes to control concurrent access to variables.

===Relationship of BPEL to BPMN===
There is no standard graphical notation for WS-BPEL, as the OASIS technical committee decided this was out of scope. Some vendors have invented their own notations. These notations take advantage of the fact that most constructs in BPEL are block-structured (e.g., sequence, while, pick, scope, etcetera.) This feature enables a direct visual representation of BPEL process descriptions in the form of &quot;structograms&quot;, in a style reminiscent of a Nassi–Shneiderman diagram.

Others have proposed to use a substantially different business process modeling language, namely Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), as a graphical front-end to capture BPEL process descriptions. As an illustration of the feasibility of this approach, the BPMN specification includes an informal and partial mapping from BPMN to BPEL 1.1. A more detailed mapping of BPMN to BPEL has been implemented in a number of tools, including an open-source tool known as BPMN2BPEL. However, the development of these tools has exposed fundamental differences between BPMN and BPEL, which make it very difficult, and in some cases impossible, to generate human-readable BPEL code from BPMN models. Even more difficult is the problem of BPMN-to-BPEL round-trip engineering: generating BPEL code from BPMN diagrams and maintaining the original BPMN model and the generated BPEL code synchronized, in the sense that any modification to one is propagated to the other.

===Adding &#x27;programming in the small&#x27; support to BPEL===
BPEL&#x27;s control structures such as &#x27;if-then-elseif-else&#x27; and &#x27;while&#x27; as well as its variable manipulation facilities depend on the use of &#x27;programming in the small&#x27; languages to provide logic. All BPEL implementations must support XPath 1.0 as a default language. But the design of BPEL envisages extensibility so that systems builders can use other languages as well. BPELJ is an effort related to JSR 207 that may enable Java to function as a &#x27;programming in the small&#x27; language within BPEL.

===BPEL4People===
Despite wide acceptance of Web services in distributed business applications, the absence of human interactions was a significant gap for many real-world business processes.

To fill this gap, BPEL4People extended BPEL from orchestration of Web services alone to orchestration of role-based human activities as well.

==== Objectives ====

Within the context of a business process BPEL4People
* supports role-based interaction of people
* provides means of assigning users to generic human roles
* takes care to delegate ownership of a task to a person only
* supports scenario as
**four-eyes scenario
**nomination
**escalation
**chained execution
by extending BPEL with additional independent syntax and semantic.

The &quot;WS-HumanTask&quot; specification introduces the definition of human tasks and notifications, including their properties, behavior and a set of operations used to manipulate human tasks. A coordination protocol is introduced in order to control autonomy and life cycle of service-enabled human tasks in an interoperable manner.

The &quot;BPEL4People&quot; specification introduces a WS-BPEL extension to address human interactions in WS-BPEL as a first-class citizen. It defines a new type of basic activity which uses human tasks as an implementation, and allows specifying tasks local to a process or use tasks defined outside of the process definition. This extension is based on the WS-HumanTask specification.

===WS-BPEL 2.0===
Version 2.0 introduced some changes and new features:
* New activity types: (parallel and sequential), 
* Renamed activities: renamed to , renamed to 
* Termination Handler added to scope activities to provide explicit behavior for termination
* Variable initialization
* XSLT for variable transformations (New XPath extension function )
* XPath access to variable data (XPath variable syntax )
* XML schema variables in Web service activities (for WS-I doc/lit style service interactions)
* Locally declared messageExchange (internal correlation of receive and reply activities)
* Clarification of Abstract Processes (syntax and semantics)
* Enable expression language overrides at each activity

<doc id="334951" wikidata="Q5531712" url="?curid=334951" title="General Association of Baptists">
<text>Though the annual meeting of this group is denominated The General Association of The Baptists, they are most widely known as the Kindred Associations of Baptists. Other names associated with these churches are the Baptist Church of Christ, &quot;The&quot; Baptists, and Separate Baptists (though they are not directly related to the Separate Baptists in Christ). The primary location of the churches is middle Tennessee and northern Alabama. Members from this association form the largest body of Baptists in Moore County, Tennessee.

==History==
The history of The General Association of The Baptists begins with the formation of the Duck River Association in 1826. The earliest church in the region was constituted circa 1790 by Kentucky ministers Ambrose Dudley and John Taylor. The Elk River Association was formed in south-central Tennessee in 1806, in the fertile valley region formed by the Elk and Duck Rivers. As most of the Baptists of middle Tennessee, the churches of the Elk River Association were strongly Calvinistic in theology. Early in the 19th century, Alexander Campbell became connected with the Baptists for a time, and began to preach Arminian doctrine among them. Some Baptists of the region found this modification of theology appealing, and began to preach against limited atonement and unconditional election, declaring that Christ died for all mankind. The new sentiment became so strong in the Elk River Association that it led to division, and the Duck River Association of Separate Baptists was formed. The original name appears to have been &quot;Duck River Baptist Association of Christ.&quot; An outspoken leader of the division was Elder William Keele. Others were soon embroiled in dispute over the new ideas, and other associations divided or had members withdraw from them. The majority of the Concord association held the more moderate &quot;Arminian&quot; position and the Calvinistic minority withdrew in 1827, creating two Concord associations. Some ministers and churches would move into the Campbell-Stone restoration movement. The Duck River Association would maintain a Baptist course. In the following years, several things developed among Tennessee Baptists, including the Baptist State Convention in 1833, the Union University of Murfreesboro, and the Baptist Publication and Sunday School Society. Discussion on whether to support these new endeavours caused friction that split the Duck River Association in 1843. Those who supported these new measures continue as the Duck River Association of Missionary Baptists and are affiliated with the Tennessee Baptist Convention and the Southern Baptist Convention. A mind of independence, coupled with opposition to the &quot;Calvinistic&quot; stance of the three organizations, would keep the Duck River Association of Separate Baptists from supporting them. According to the 1844 minutes of the missionary group, the dissenters could not &quot;unite with you while you retain your Calvinistic doctrine.&quot;

The Duck River Baptists stayed their independent course and sought fellowship with like-minded Baptists. Through the years they developed correspondence with other Baptist associations - Mount Zion Association in 1835, Indian Creek in 1840, Union in 1848, Mount Moriah in 1851, Mount Pleasant circa 1860, East Union in 1890, Ebenezer and Mount Olive in 1891, Liberty in 1894, New Liberty in 1925, and Mount Pleasant No. 2 in 1965. Many of these fellowships are still maintained. In October 1939, delegates from Duck River, Mount Zion, Union, Mount Pleasant, Liberty, New Liberty and Ebenezer Associations, and the Pleasant Hill church of Kentucky, met at Garrison Fork Church, Bedford County, Tennessee, and organized The General Association of The Baptists. The stated purpose of this association is to &quot;perpetuate a closer union and communion among us and to preserve and maintain a correspondence with each other.&quot; In 1936 there were 52 churches with 4564 members [Religious Bodies, 1936, Vol. II, Part 1].

==Faith and practice==
These &quot;Duck River&quot; churches are considered one of the &quot;primitivistic&quot; sects among Baptists. They are moderately Calvinistic, retaining the teachings of total depravity and eternal security, while asserting that Jesus Christ tasted death for every man. Most of the churches have Sunday Schools, but no organized support of missionary or benevolent institutions. In addition to baptism and the Lord&#x27;s supper, they observe the rite of feet washing as an ordinance. Services are informal; preaching is extemporaneous. Most of the churches use musical instruments, though some do not, especially the northern Alabama churches which are heavily influenced by the Sacred Harp style of southern folk music.

==The Twelve Articles of Faith==
(From the &quot;Minutes of The One Hundred Sixty-Second Annual Session of The Union Association of The Baptist&quot;, Held with The Baptist Church of Christ at Spring Street, DeKalb County, Tennessee. October, 2008)
#We believe in only one true and living God. the Father. the Word and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one. (Isaiah 45:22; 1 John 5:7)
#We believe the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament to be the word of God, and the only rule of Faith and practice. (1st Peter 1:10-12; 2nd Peter 1:21; 2nd Timothy 3: 15–17)
#We believe that by one man sin entered the World, and death by sin so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned, and are by nature the children of wrath. (Romans 5: 12-17-19: Ephesians 2: 1–5)
#We believe that Jesus Christ, by the Grace of God, tasted death for every man, and through his meritorious death the way of salvation is made possible for God to have mercy upon all who come unto him upon Gospel terms. (Hebrews 2:9-10: 10: 19-22: John 3: 16: Titus 2: II)
#We believe that sinners are justified in the sight of God only by the Righteousness of God imputed upon them, through their Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. (Ephesians 2:8-10; Romans 5:1-5; 3:21-28).
#We believe that the Saints will persevere in Grace, and not one of them will be finally lost. (Romans 8:35-39; Hebrews 6:4-6, 18, 19; 1st John 3:9: St. John 10:27-29)
#We believe that there will be a Resurrection of the dead. both of the just and the unjust. and general Judgment, and the happiness of the Righteous and the punishment of the wicked will be Eternal. (John 5:28-29; 1st Corinthians 15:42-49; 1st Thessalonians 4: 14–18)
#We believe the visible Church of Christ is a congregation of Faithful men and women. who have given themselves to the Lord and obtained fellowship with each other, and have agreed to keep a Godly discipline according to the rules of the Gospel. (Matthew 16: 18: 18: 15-18: 1st Corinthians 12:27-28: Ephesians 2: 19–22)
#We believe in revealed religion by operation of the Spirit, agreeable to the word of God. and that Jesus Christ is the great head of the Church, and the Government thereof is with the Body. (Matthew 16: 17: Galatians I: 15–16; 1st Corinthians 2:9-11)
#We believe that true believers are the only fit subjects for Baptism and that immersion is the only mode, and that the Lord&#x27;s Supper and the Washing of Saints&#x27; Feet are ordinances of Christ to be continued until his second corning. (Matthew 3:13-17: Mark 14:22-25: Matthew 28: 19–20; John 13:4-17)
#We believe that none but regularly Baptized members have the right to commune at the Lord&#x27;s Table, and no one has the right to administer the ordinance of the Gospel, except he be legally called and qualified. (Luke 10:2-3; Acts 13: 1–4; 1st Corinthians 5: II; II: 17; 20. 28, 29: Exodus 12:43-49)
#We believe that the Lord&#x27;s Day ought to be observed and set apart for the worship of God. and that no work or worldly business should be transacted thereon—works of piety and necessity excepted. (Acts 20:7; Colossians 2: 16–17)

==Status==
The General Association of The Baptists is currently made up of seven associations – Mt. Zion Association of Baptist (TN), Mt. Pleasant Association of Baptists [&quot;No. 1&quot;] (AL), Mt. Pleasant Association [No. 2] of The Baptists (AL), East Union Association of The Baptist (TN), Union Association of The Baptist (TN) – and one independent church – Pleasant Hill Regular Baptist Church of Marion, Kentucky. In 2002, these represented a total membership of 10,393 in 97 churches. Correspondence was dropped with the Duck River Association of Baptists (TN) in 2018.

In addition to participation in the General Association, the local associations maintain correspondence with one another at their annual meetings. Each association is free to correspond with other like-minded associations that are not participating in the General Association, though there is no such correspondence at this time. In recent years there has been some interchange with the Town Creek Association of United Baptists (AL), and a failed attempt to achieve correspondence with the East Washington Association of Regular Baptists (AR).

<text>Benjamin &quot;Ben&quot; Dunkelman DSO (June 26, 1913 – June 11, 1997) was a Canadian Jewish officer who served in the Canadian Army in World War II and the Israel Defense Forces in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. In Israel, he was called Benjamin Ben-David.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Benjamin Dunkelman was the son of &quot;Ashkenazim&quot; immigrants from the town of Makov (modern Maków Mazowiecki, Poland) in the Russian Empire. His father was David Dunkelman, the founder of the Canadian men&#x27;s retailers, Tip Top Tailors and his mother Rose was a committed Zionist. Dunkelman and his siblings grew up on an estate, Sunnybrook Farm (now the site of Sunnybrook Medical Centre), northeast of Toronto built by his wealthy father. Dunkelman later recalled about growing on Sunnybrooke Farm that &quot;it was a dreamland, a children’s paradise&quot;.

He attended Upper Canada College in Toronto, where he was noted for his active social life and for excelling at football. Besides his love of sports, Dunkelman enjoyed sailing Lake Ontario in his yacht. In 1931, financial losses caused by the Great Depression forced David Dunkelman to sell off Sunnybrook Farm. 

At the age of 18, Dunkelman went off to work on a kibbutz in Palestine, at that time a League of Nations Mandate administered by Great Britain. Dunkelman was inspired by his Zionist mother to go to the Palestine Mandate. At the &quot;kibbutz&quot;, he worked as a &quot;shomer&quot;, an armed watchman, whose duty it was to protect the &quot;kibbutz&quot; from raiders. Dunkelman recalled: &quot;I went off a flabby, pampered boy; I returned as a tough young man who had seen the world.&quot; He loved the Holy Land, and only reluctantly returned to Toronto in 1932 to assist his father, but went again to Palestine in the late 1935 to develop new settlements.

===Military career===
He was back in Toronto in 1939 when the Second World War broke out. He attempted to join the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN), but antisemitism in the RCN at the time precluded a naval career. Instead Dunkelman enlisted as a private with The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada; as the war progressed he rose from private to major. Dunkelman enlisted with the Second Battalion of the Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles in 1940. Dunkelman later gave his reason for enlisting as an &quot;active&quot; (willing to fight overseas) member as &quot;I am a Canadian, proud of Canada’s heritage and proud -- if need be -- to fight for it.&quot; 

He was in the second wave to land on Juno Beach, the beach assigned to Canada in the Normandy landings on D-Day, 6 June 1944. During his service with the regiment, he earned numerous commendations. He also fought in the difficult campaigns in northern France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, including bloody battles of Caen, the Falaise pocket, and the Battle of the Scheldt to open up the critical port of Antwerp. During the Normandy campaign in June-August 1944 and then during the Battle of the Scheldt, the Canadian Army took heavy losses. At the same time, the policy of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King of only sending &quot;active&quot; members who had volunteered to fight overseas ensured there was a shortage of replacements. Under Mackenzie King&#x27;s policy, men were conscripted for the military, but only for the defense of Canada, leading to a situation where two divisions stood waiting on the coast of British Columbia and another division on the coast of Nova Scotia. At the time of the Battle of the Scheldt, Dunkelman wrote in disgust: &quot;We knew why leaves were so scarce. Thanks to Prime Minister Mackenzie King&#x27;s handling of the Conscription issue at home&quot;.    

In 1945, he was awarded a Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his service in the Hochwald campaign in northwest Germany during the drive to the river Rhine. In March 1945, Dunkelman played a key role in taking the steep Balberger Wald ridge in the dark forests of the Hochwald. 

After the war, he was offered command of the Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles but declined owing to business interests at home. Dunkelman returned to Canada, but again decided to travel to war, this time to fight for Israel in the spring of 1948. On 14 May 1948, the Palestine Mandate came to an end and the State of Israel was proclaimed. Israel was immediately invaded by the armies of Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, and Syria. He arrived there at a time when the Israeli army was short of officers with combat experience. Initially, he took command of a mortar unit in the Mahal, the legion of Jewish and Christian foreign volunteers fighting for Israel.

Dunkelman&#x27;s skill with mortars brought him to the attention of the Israeli High Command, and he was instrumental in the breaking of the siege of Jerusalem, which had been besieged by the Jordanians almost since the beginning of the war. Shortly afterwards, he became the commander of the 7th Brigade, the country&#x27;s best-known armored brigade. Dunkelman and the 7th Brigade were initially sent to Galilee to halt the advance of the Syrians. Under his command, the 7th Brigade stopped the Syrian advance and recaptured much of upper western Galilee. 

In his autobiography, &quot;Dual Allegiance&quot;, Dunkelman tells the story of how, between July 8 and 18, 1948 during Operation Dekel, he led the 7th Brigade and its supporting units as it moved to capture the town of Nazareth. Nazareth surrendered after little more than token resistance.

Shortly after the capture of Nazareth, Dunkelman received orders from General Chaim Laskov to expel the Palestinian civilian population from the town, which he refused to carry out. Israeli journalist and translator Peretz Kidron, with whom Dunkelman collaborated in writing &quot;Dual Allegiance&quot;, reproduced his record of Dunkelman&#x27;s account of the capture of Nazareth in a book chapter entitled &quot;Truth Whereby Nations Live&quot;:
:&quot;[less than a day later] Haim Laskov [came] to me with astounding orders: Nazareth&#x27;s civilian population was to be evacuated! I was shocked and horrified. I told him I would do nothing of the sort—in view of our promises to safeguard the city&#x27;s people, such a move would be both superfluous and harmful. I reminded him that scarcely a day earlier, he and I, as representatives of the Israeli army, had signed the surrender document in which we solemnly pledged to do nothing to harm the city or its population. When Haim saw that I refused to obey the order, he left.&quot;

Twelve hours after Dunkelman refused to expel the inhabitants of Nazareth, Laskov appointed another officer as military governor.
:&quot;Two days after the second truce came into effect, the Seventh Brigade was ordered to withdraw from Nazareth. Avraham Yaffe, who had commanded the 13th battalion in the assault on the city, now reported to me with orders from Moshe Carmel to take over from me as its military governor. I complied with the order, but only after Avraham had given me his word of honour that he would do nothing to harm or displace the Arab population. [...] I felt sure that [the order to withdraw from Nazareth] had been given because of my defiance of the evacuation order.&quot;

Dunkelman&#x27;s defiance of the evacuation order forced Laskov to attempt to obtain sanction from a higher level. However, David Ben-Gurion finally vetoed the order; the Arab inhabitants in Nazareth were never forced to evacuate. Dunkelman&#x27;s argument that expelling the mostly Christian Palestinians of Nazareth would damage relations with the overwhelming Christian nations of the West seemed to have changed Ben-Gurion&#x27;s mind. During the war, Dunkelman met and married Yael Lifshitz. Lifshitz was a corporal in the Israeli Army who served under Dunkelman.

==Civilian career==
After the war Dunkelman was offered, but refused, a commission in the peacetime Israeli Army; the Dunkelmans returned instead to Toronto where he went into the family business, which he expanded, then sold to Dylex Limited in 1967. In recognition of Dunkelman&#x27;s World War II service, the Parliament of Canada voted to give Yael Dunkelman Canadian citizenship, instead of forcing her to apply for Canadian citizenship, which her husband called a &quot;splendid gesture&quot;. The Dunkelmans had six children.

He later became a developer. Among his developments were the Cloverdale Mall and the Constellation Hotel, later renamed the Regal Constellation Hotel. Dunkelman was one of the founders of the Island Yacht Club, which he founded in 1951 after the Royal Canadian Yacht Club refused to accept him on account of his being Jewish. Dunkelman lived in retirement in Toronto until his death. 

In 1967, he almost died of a heart attack, which led him to retire from the family&#x27;s business of running the Tip Top Tailors company. After his heart attack, he decided to focus on his real passion, collecting art. He and his wife also ran the Dunkelman Gallery in Toronto, as well as several restaurants. The Dunkelman Gallery, which he founded in 1967, became &quot;well-known as a showcase for Canadian and international artists&quot;. In September 1969, the Dunkelman Gallery hosted the personal archaeological collection of the Israeli Defense Minister, General Moshe Dayan, which mostly consisted of art from ancient Canaan and Phoenicia.

There is a bridge on the Lebanese border called &quot;Gesher Ben&quot; in Dunkelman&#x27;s honor. His story is told in the film &quot;Ben Dunkelman: The Reluctant Warrior&quot;.

<text>The therapeutic index (TI; also referred to as therapeutic ratio) is a quantitative measurement of the relative safety of a drug with regard to risk of overdose. It is a comparison of the amount of a therapeutic agent that causes toxicity to the amount that causes the therapeutic effect. The related terms therapeutic window or safety window refer to a range of doses optimized between efficacy and toxicity, achieving the greatest therapeutic benefit without resulting in unacceptable side-effects or toxicity.

Classically, for clinical indications of an approved drug, TI refers to the ratio of the dose of the drug that causes adverse effects at an incidence/severity not compatible with the targeted indication (e.g. toxic dose in 50% of subjects, TD) to the dose that leads to the desired pharmacological effect (e.g. efficacious dose in 50% of subjects, ED). In contrast, in a drug development setting TI is calculated based on plasma levels.

In the early days of pharmaceutical toxicology, TI was frequently determined in animals as lethal dose of a drug for 50% of the population (LD50) divided by the minimum effective dose for 50% of the population (ED50). In modern settings, more sophisticated toxicity endpoints are used.

For many drugs, severe toxicities in humans occur at sublethal doses, which limit their maximum dose. A higher safety-based therapeutic index is preferable instead of a lower one; an individual would have to take a much higher dose of a drug to reach the lethal threshold than the dose taken to induce the therapeutic effect of the drug. However, a lower efficacy-based therapeutic index is preferable instead of a higher one; an individual would have to take a higher dose of a drug to reach the toxic threshold than the dose taken to induce the therapeutic effect of the drug.

Generally, a drug or other therapeutic agent with a narrow therapeutic range (i.e. having little difference between toxic and therapeutic doses) may have its dosage adjusted according to measurements of its blood levels in the person taking it. This may be achieved through therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) protocols. TDM is recommended for use in the treatment of psychiatric disorders with lithium due to its narrow therapeutic range.

==Types==
Based on efficacy and safety of drugs, there are two types of therapeutic index:

;Safety-based therapeutic index
formula_1
It is desirous for the value of LD to be as large as possible, to decrease risk of lethal effects and increase the therapeutic window. In the above formula, TI increases as the difference between LD and ED increases—hence, a higher safety-based therapeutic index indicates a larger therapeutic window, and vice versa.

;Efficacy-based therapeutic index
formula_2
Ideally the ED is as low as possible for faster drug response and larger therapeutic window, whereas a drugs TD is ideally as large as possible to decrease risk of toxic effects. In the above equation, the greater the difference between ED and TD, the greater the value of TI. Hence, a lower efficacy-based therapeutic index indicates a larger therapeutic window.

;Protective index
Similar to safety-based therapeutic index, the protective index uses TD50 (median &quot;toxic&quot; dose) in place of LD50.

formula_3

For many substances, toxicity can occur at levels far below lethal effects (that cause death), and thus, if toxicity is properly specified, the protective index is often more informative about a substance&#x27;s relative safety. Nevertheless, the safety-based therapeutic index (formula_4) is still useful as it can be considered an upper bound of the protective index, and the former also has the advantages of objectivity and easier comprehension.

Since the protective index (PI) is calculated as TD divided by ED, it can be mathematically expressed that:
:formula_5
which means that formula_6 is a reciprocal of protective index.

All the above types of therapeutic index can be used in both pre-clinical trials and clinical trials.

==Drug development==
A low efficacy-based therapeutic index (formula_6) and a high safety-based therapeutic index (formula_8) are preferable for a drug to have a favorable efficacy vs safety profile. At the early discovery/development stage, the clinical TI of a drug candidate is unknown. However, understanding the preliminary TI of a drug candidate is of utmost importance as early as possible since TI is an important indicator of the probability of successful development. Recognizing drug candidates with potentially suboptimal TI at the earliest possible stage helps to initiate mitigation or potentially re-deploy resources.

TI is the quantitative relationship between pharmacological efficacy and toxicological safety of a drug, without considering the nature of pharmacological or toxicological endpoints themselves. However, to convert a calculated TI into something useful, the nature and limitations of pharmacological and/or toxicological endpoints must be considered. Depending on the intended clinical indication, the associated unmet medical need and/or the competitive situation, more or less weight can be given to either the safety or efficacy of a drug candidate in order to create a well balanced indication-specific efficacy vs safety profile.

In general, it is the exposure of a given tissue to drug (i.e. drug concentration over time), rather than dose, that drives the pharmacological and toxicological effects. For example, at the same dose there may be marked inter-individual variability in exposure due to polymorphisms in metabolism, DDIs or differences in body weight or environmental factors. These considerations emphasize the importance of using exposure instead of dose to calculate TI. To account for delays between exposure and toxicity, the TI for toxicities that occur after multiple dose administrations should be calculated using the exposure to drug at steady state rather than after administration of a single dose.

A review published by Muller and Milton in &quot;Nature Reviews Drug Discovery&quot; critically discusses TI determination and interpretation in a translational drug development setting for both small molecules and biotherapeutics.

==Range of therapeutic indices==
The therapeutic index varies widely among substances, even within a related group.

For instance, the opioid painkiller remifentanil is very forgiving, offering a therapeutic index of 33,000:1, while Diazepam, a benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic and skeletal muscle relaxant, has a less forgiving therapeutic index of 100:1. Morphine is even less so with a therapeutic index of 70.

Less safe are cocaine (a stimulant and local anaesthetic) and ethanol (a sedative): the therapeutic indices for these substances are 15:1 and 10:1, respectively. Paracetamol, alternatively known by its trade names Tylenol or Panadol, also has a therapeutic index of 10.

Even less safe are drugs such as digoxin, a cardiac glycoside; its therapeutic index is approximately 2:1.

Other examples of drugs with a narrow therapeutic range, which may require drug monitoring both to achieve therapeutic levels and to minimize toxicity, include dimercaprol, theophylline, warfarin and lithium carbonate.

Some antibiotics and antifungals require monitoring to balance efficacy with minimizing adverse effects, including: gentamicin, vancomycin, amphotericin B (nicknamed &#x27;amphoterrible&#x27; for this very reason), and polymyxin B.

===Cancer radiotherapy===
Radiotherapy aims to shrink tumors and kill cancer cells using high energy. The energy arises from x-rays, gamma rays, or charged or heavy particles. The therapeutic ratio in radiotherapy for cancer treatment is determined by the maximum radiation dose for killing cancer cells and the minimum radiation dose causing acute or late morbidity in cells of normal tissues. Both of these parameters have sigmoidal dose–response curves. Thus, a favorable outcome in dose–response for tumor tissue is greater than that of normal tissue for the same dose, meaning that the treatment is effective on tumors and does not cause serious morbidity to normal tissue. Conversely, overlapping response for two tissues is highly likely to cause serious morbidity to normal tissue and ineffective treatment of tumors. The mechanism of radiation therapy is categorized as direct or indirect radiation. Both direct and indirect radiation induce DNA mutation or chromosomal rearrangement during its repair process. Direct radiation creates a DNA free radical from radiation energy deposition that damages DNA. Indirect radiation occurs from radiolysis of water, creating a free hydroxyl radical, hydronium and electron. The hydroxyl radical transfers its radical to DNA. Or together with hydronium and electron, a free hydroxyl radical can damage the base region of DNA.
Cancer cells cause an imbalance of signals in the cell cycle. G1 and G2/M arrest were found to be major checkpoints by irradiating human cells. G1 arrest delays the repair mechanism before synthesis of DNA in S phase and mitosis in M phase, suggesting it is a key checkpoint for survival of cells. G2/M arrest occurs when cells need to repair after S phase but before mitotic entry. It is known that S phase is the most resistant to radiation and M phase is the most sensitive to radiation. p53, a tumor suppressor protein that plays a role in G1 and G2/M arrest, enabled the understanding of the cell cycle through radiation. For example, irradiation of myeloid leukemia cells leads to an increase in p53 and a decrease in the level of DNA synthesis. Patients with Ataxia telangiectasia delays have hypersensitivity to radiation due to the delay of accumulation of p53. In this case, cells are able to replicate without repair of their DNA, becoming prone to incidence of cancer. Most cells are in G1 and S phase. Irradiation at G2 phase showed increased radiosensitivity and thus G1 arrest has been a focus for therapeutic treatment.
Irradiation of a tissue induces a response in both irradiated and non-irridiated cells. It was found that even cells up to 50–75 cell diameters distant from irradiated cells exhibit a phenotype of enhanced genetic instability such as micronucleation. This suggests an effect on cell-to-cell communication such as paracrine and juxtacrine signaling. Normal cells do not lose their DNA repair mechanism whereas cancer cells often lose it during radiotherapy. However, the high energy radiation can override the ability of damaged normal cells to repair, leading to additional risk of carcinogenesis. This suggests a significant risk associated with radiation therapy. Thus, it is desirable to improve the therapeutic ratio during radiotherapy. Employing IG-IMRT, protons and heavy ions are likely to minimize the dose to normal tissues by altered fractionation. Molecular targeting of the DNA repair pathway can lead to radiosensitization or radioprotection. Examples are direct and indirect inhibitors on DNA double-strand breaks. Direct inhibitors target proteins (PARP family) and kinases (ATM, DNA-PKCs) that are involved in DNA repair. Indirect inhibitors target protein tumor cell signaling proteins such as EGFR and insulin growth factor.

The effective therapeutic index can be affected by targeting, in which the therapeutic agent is concentrated in its desirable area of effect. For example, in radiation therapy for cancerous tumors, shaping the radiation beam precisely to the profile of a tumor in the &quot;beam&#x27;s eye view&quot; can increase the delivered dose without increasing toxic effects, though such shaping might not change the therapeutic index. Similarly, chemotherapy or radiotherapy with infused or injected agents can be made more efficacious by attaching the agent to an oncophilic substance, as in peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumors and in chemoembolization or radioactive microspheres therapy for liver tumors and metastases. This concentrates the agent in the targeted tissues and lowers its concentration in others, increasing efficacy and lowering toxicity.

==Safety ratio==
Sometimes the term safety ratio is used, particularly when referring to psychoactive drugs used for non-therapeutic purposes, e.g. recreational use. In such cases, the &quot;effective&quot; dose is the amount and frequency that produces the &quot;desired&quot; effect, which can vary, and can be greater or less than the therapeutically effective dose.

The &quot;Certain Safety Factor&quot;, also referred to as the &quot;Margin of Safety (MOS)&quot;, is the ratio of the lethal dose to 1% of population to the effective dose to 99% of the population (LD/ED). This is a better safety index than the LD50 for materials that have both desirable and undesirable effects, because it factors in the ends of the spectrum where doses may be necessary to produce a response in one person but can, at the same dose, be lethal in another.

:formula_9

==Synergistic effect==
A therapeutic index does not consider drug interactions or synergistic effects. For example, the risk associated with benzodiazepines increases significantly when taken with alcohol, depressants, opiates, or stimulants when compared with being taken alone. Therapeutic index also does not take into account the ease or difficulty of reaching a toxic or lethal dose. This is more of a consideration for recreational drug users, as the purity can be highly variable.

==Therapeutic window==
The &quot;therapeutic window&quot; (or pharmaceutical window) of a drug is the range of drug dosages which can treat disease effectively without having toxic effects. Medication with a small therapeutic window must be administered with care and control, frequently measuring blood concentration of the drug, to avoid harm. Medications with narrow therapeutic windows include theophylline, digoxin, lithium, and warfarin.

==Optimal biological dose==
Optimal biological dose (OBD) is the quantity of a drug that will most effectively produce the desired effect while remaining in the range of acceptable toxicity.

==Maximum tolerated dose==
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) refers to the highest dose of a radiological or pharmacological treatment that will produce the desired effect without unacceptable toxicity. The purpose of administering MTD is to determine whether long-term exposure to a chemical might lead to unacceptable adverse health effects in a population, when the level of exposure is not sufficient to cause premature mortality due to short-term toxic effects. The maximum dose is used, rather than a lower dose, to reduce the number of test subjects (and, among other things, the cost of testing), to detect an effect that might occur only rarely. This type of analysis is also used in establishing chemical residue tolerances in foods. Maximum tolerated dose studies are also done in clinical trials.

MTD is an essential aspect of a drug&#x27;s profile. All modern healthcare systems dictate a maximum safe dose for each drug, and generally have numerous safeguards (e.g. insurance quantity limits and government-enforced maximum quantity/time-frame limits) to prevent the prescription and dispensing of quantities exceeding the highest dosage which has been demonstrated to be safe for members of the general patient population.

Patients are often unable to tolerate the theoretical MTD of a drug due to the occurrence of side-effects which are not innately a manifestation of toxicity (not considered to severely threaten a patient&#x27;s health) but cause the patient sufficient distress and/or discomfort to result in non-compliance with treatment. Such examples include emotional &quot;blunting&quot; with antidepressants, pruritus with opiates, and blurred vision with anticholinergics.

<doc id="334957" wikidata="Q422222" url="?curid=334957" title="Digoxin">
<text>Digoxin (better known as Digitalis), sold under the brand name Lanoxin among others, is a medication used to treat various heart conditions. Most frequently it is used for atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and heart failure. Digoxin is one of the oldest medications used in the field of cardiology. It works by increasing myocardial contractility, increasing stroke volume
and blood pressure, reducing heart rate, and somewhat extending the time frame of the contraction. Digoxin is taken by mouth or by injection into a vein. Digoxin has a half life of approximately 36 hours given at average doses in patients with normal renal function. It is excreted mostly unchanged in the urine.
Common side effects include breast enlargement with other side effects generally due to an excessive dose. These side effects may include loss of appetite, nausea, trouble seeing, confusion, and an irregular heartbeat. Greater care is required in older people and those with poor kidney function. It is unclear whether use during pregnancy is safe.
Digoxin is in the cardiac glycoside family of medications. It was first isolated in 1930 from the foxglove plant, &quot;Digitalis lanata&quot;. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. In 2021, it was the 241st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1million prescriptions.

== Medical uses ==

=== Irregular heartbeat ===
The most common indications for digoxin are atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, especially in older or less active patients, though beta blockers and/or calcium channel blockers may be preferred in some patients, such as younger more active ones, or those without heart failure or hemodynamic instability.

Early observational studies showed an increased risk of death in patients taking digoxin, despite an attempt to allow for other risk factors for death (so-called propensity score matching). However, systematic reviews focusing on randomised controlled trials of digoxin (which ensured similarity between patients on digoxin, and those not on it) showed no difference in mortality. Evidence suggested the increased mortality in patients taking digoxin was due to their having worse heart disease than those not taking it. Cardiac arrhythmias may also occur when patients are prescribed digoxin alongside thiazides and loop diuretics.

=== Heart failure ===
Digitalis (i.e. extracts, including digoxin, from the plant genus &quot;Digitalis&quot;) was the first drug used to treat dropsy (swollen ankles—a symptom of heart failure) following its discovery by William Withering. Alongside diuretics, it was the mainstay of treatment for heart failure for over a century. Since the introduction of other drugs with better outcomes and fewer adverse effects, it is generally now only used where heart failure is associated with atrial fibrillation and or a rapid ventricular rate. In certain circumstances it may be used under specialist guidance in addition to, or instead of, the recommended first-line treatments of ACE inhibitor, beta blocker, mineralocorticoid antagonist, and SGLT-2 inhibitor, where they are not effective or not tolerated. 

=== Abortion ===
Digoxin is also used intrafetally or amniotically during abortions in the late second trimester and third trimester of pregnancy. It typically causes fetal demise (measured by cessation of cardiac activity) within hours of administration.

== Side effects ==
The occurrence of adverse drug reactions is common, owing to its narrow therapeutic index (the margin between effectiveness and toxicity). Gynaecomastia (enlargement of breast tissue) is mentioned in many textbooks as a side effect, thought to be due to the estrogen-like steroid moiety of the digoxin molecule, but when systematically sought, the evidence for this is equivocal .
The combination of increased (atrial) arrhythmogenesis and inhibited atrioventricular (AV) conduction (for example paroxysmal atrial tachycardia with AV block – so-called &quot;PAT with block&quot;) is said to be pathognomonic (that is, diagnostic) of digoxin toxicity.

Digoxin can lead to cardiac arrhythmias when given with thiazides and loop diuretics. This is because co-administration of Digoxin with drugs such as thiazides and loop diuretics which can cause hypokalemia, low serum levels of potassium in the blood. This exacerbates the potential for cardiac arrhythmias because the low levels of potassium reduces the amount of K+ at the ATPase pump and increase calcium levels too much which leads to these arrhythmias. It can also cause visual disturbances as well as dizziness or fainting.

Several other drugs associated with ADRs in concomitant use include verapamil, amiodarone, quinidine, tetracycline, and erythromycin.

==Overdose==
In overdose, the usual supportive measures are needed. If arrhythmias prove troublesome, or malignant hyperkalemia occurs (inexorably rising potassium level due to paralysis of the cell membrane-bound, ATPase-dependent Na/K pumps), the specific antidote is antidigoxin (antibody fragments against digoxin, trade names Digibind and Digifab). The mechanism of action for drugs such as Digibind and Digifab, used when adverse events occur with the use of digoxin, is that the FAB regions on the antibodies created against digoxin expedite the excretion of the drug into urine. Therefore, the amount of digoxin in the body decreases quickly as it gets excreted rapidly.

==Pharmacology==

=== Pharmacodynamics ===

Digoxin&#x27;s primary mechanism of action involves inhibition of the sodium potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na+/K+ ATPase), mainly in the myocardium. This inhibition causes an increase in intracellular sodium levels, resulting in decreased activity of the sodium-calcium exchanger, which normally imports three extracellular sodium ions into the cell and transports one intracellular calcium ion out of the cell. The reversal of this exchanger, triggered by the increase in intracellular sodium, results in an increase in the intracellular calcium concentration that is available to the contractile proteins. The increased calcium concentrations lead to the binding of more calcium to troponin C, which results in increased inotropy. Increased intracellular calcium lengthens phase 4 and phase 0 of the cardiac action potential, which leads to a decrease in heart rate. Increased amounts of Ca2+ also leads to increased storage of calcium in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, causing a corresponding increase in the release of calcium during each action potential. This leads to increased contractility (the force of contraction) of the heart without increasing heart energy expenditure.

The inhibition of the sodium pump may also improve baroreceptor sensitivity in heart failure and may explain some of the neurohormonal effects of digoxin.

Digoxin also has important parasympathetic effects, particularly on the atrioventricular node. While it does increase the magnitude of myocardial contractility, the duration of the contraction is only slightly increased. Its use as an antiarrhythmic drug, then, comes from its direct and indirect parasympathetic stimulating properties. Vagus nerve stimulation slows down conduction at the AV node by increasing the refractory period of cardiac myocytes. The slowed AV node gives the ventricles more time to fill before contracting. This negative chronotropic effect is synergistic with the direct effect on cardiac pacemaker cells. The arrhythmia itself is not affected, but the pumping function of the heart improves, owing to improved filling.

Overall, the heart rate is decreased while stroke volume is increased, resulting in a net increase in blood pressure, leading to increased tissue perfusion. This causes the myocardium to work more efficiently, with optimized hemodynamics and an improved ventricular function curve.

Other electrical effects include a brief initial increase in action potential, followed by a decrease as the K+ conductance increases due to increased intracellular amounts of Ca2+ ions. The refractory period of the atria and ventricles is decreased, while it increases in the sinoatrial and AV nodes. A less negative resting membrane potential is made, leading to increased irritability.

The conduction velocity increases in the atria, but decreases in the AV node. The effect upon Purkinje fibers and ventricles is negligible. Automaticity is also increased in the atria, AV node, Purkinje fibers, and ventricles.

ECG changes seen in people taking digoxin include increased PR interval (due to decreased AV conduction) and a shortened QT interval. Also, the T wave may be inverted and accompanied by ST depression. It may cause AV junctional rhythm and ectopic beats (bigeminy) resulting in ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation.

Digoxin is also an M2 receptor muscarinic agonist.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
Digoxin is usually given orally, but can also be given by IV injection in urgent situations (the IV injection should be slow, and heart rhythm should be monitored). While IV therapy may be better tolerated (less nausea), digoxin has a very long distribution half-life into the cardiac tissue, which will delay its onset of action by a number of hours. The half-life is about 36 hours for patients with normal renal function, digoxin is given once daily, usually in 125 μg or 250 μg doses.

Digoxin elimination is mainly by renal excretion and involves P-glycoprotein, which leads to significant clinical interactions with P-glycoprotein inhibitor drugs. Examples commonly used in patients with heart problems include spironolactone, verapamil and amiodarone. In patients with decreased kidney function the half-life is considerably longer, along with decrease in Vd (volume of distribution), calling for a reduction in dose or a switch to a different glycoside, such as digitoxin (not available in the United States), which has a much longer elimination half-life of around seven days and is eliminated by the liver.

Effective plasma levels vary depending on the medical indication. For congestive heart failure, levels between 0.5 and 1.0 ng/mL are recommended. This recommendation is based on &quot;post hoc&quot; analysis of prospective trials, suggesting higher levels may be associated with increased mortality rates. For heart rate control (atrial fibrillation), plasma levels are less defined and are generally titrated to a goal heart rate. Typically, digoxin levels are considered therapeutic for heart rate control between 0.5 and 2.0 ng/mL (or 0.6 and 2.6 nmol/L). In suspected toxicity or ineffectiveness, digoxin levels should be monitored. Plasma potassium levels also need to be closely controlled (see side effects, below).

Quinidine, verapamil, and amiodarone increase plasma levels of digoxin (by displacing tissue binding sites and depressing renal digoxin clearance), so plasma digoxin must be monitored carefully when coadministered. 

A study which looked to see if digoxin affected men and women differently found that digoxin did not reduce deaths overall, but did result in less hospitalization. Women who took digoxin died &quot;more frequently&quot; (33%) than women who took placebo (29%). Digoxin increased the risk of death in women by 23%. There was no difference in the death rate for men in the study.

Digoxin is also used as a standard control substance to test for P-glycoprotein inhibition.

Digoxin appears to be a peripherally selective drug due to limited brain uptake caused by binding to P-glycoprotein.

===Pharmacomicrobiomics===
The bacteria &quot;Eggerthella lenta&quot; has been linked to a decrease in the toxicity of Digoxin. These effects have been studied through comparisons of North Americans and Southern Indians, in which a reduced digoxin metabolite profile correlates with &quot;E. lenta&quot; abundance. Further studies have also revealed an increase in digoxin toxicity when used alongside erythromycin or tetracycline, the researches attributed this to the decrease in the &quot;E. lenta&quot; population.

== History ==
Derivatives of plants of the genus &quot;Digitalis&quot; have a long history of medical use. Nicholas Culpeper referred to various medical uses for Foxglove in his 1652 publication &quot;The English physician&quot;. William Withering is credited with the first published description of the systematic use of &quot;Digitalis&quot; derivatives in his 1785 book &quot;An Account of the Foxglove and some of its Medical Uses With Practical Remarks on Dropsy and Other Diseases&quot;. Its use was somewhat sporadic until Sir James Mackenzie identified the phenomenon of atrial fibrillation, and the actions of digitalis on this. Its effects were first explained by Arthur Robertson Cushny. The name is a portmanteau, derived from &quot;Digitalis lanata&quot; and &quot;toxin&quot;.

In 1930, Digoxin was first isolated by Dr. Sydney Smith from the foxglove plant, &quot;Digitalis lanata&quot;. Initially, the digoxin was purified by dissolving the dried plant material in acetone and boiling the solution in chloroform. The solution was then reacted with acetic acid and small amount of ferric chloride and sulfuric acid (Keller reaction). Digoxin was distinguishable from other glucosides by the olive-green colored solution produced from this reaction, completely free of red.

== Society and culture ==
Charles Cullen admitted in 2003 to killing as many as 40 hospital patients with overdoses of heart medication—usually digoxin—at hospitals in New Jersey and Pennsylvania over his 19-year career as a nurse. On March 10, 2006, he was sentenced to 18 consecutive life sentences and is not eligible for parole.

On April 25, 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a press release alerting the public to a Class I recall of Digitek, a brand of digoxin produced by Mylan. Some tablets had been released at double thickness and therefore double strength, causing some patients to experience digoxin toxicity. A class-action lawsuit against the Icelandic generic drug maker Actavis was announced two weeks later.

On March 31, 2009, the FDA announced another generic digoxin pill recall by posting this company press release on the agency&#x27;s web site: &quot;Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Ltd. Announces a Nationwide Voluntary Recall of All Lots of Digoxin Tablets Due to Size Variability&quot;. A March 31 press release from Caraco, a generic pharmaceutical company, stated:

A 2008 study suggested digoxin has beneficial effects not only for the heart, but also in reducing the risk of certain kinds of cancer. However, comments on this study suggested that digoxin is not effective at reducing cancer risk at therapeutic concentrations of the drug, so the results need further investigation.

==Digoxin and cancer==
Cardiac glycosides, particularly digoxin, have been conventionally used for treatment of common cardiac problems, mainly heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias. The interaction of digoxin and cancer has also been studied. Despite existence of numerous preclinical studies that investigated the anticancer effects of digoxin, there are no solid and conclusive results so far. 

Several studies have suggested that digoxin may have anticancer properties, others not.

Digoxin, as a cardiac glycoside, has a chemical structure basically similar to that of estradiol. Digoxin has the ability to bind oestrogen receptors, and therefore it has been proposed that it might increase the risk of oestrogen-sensitive breast and uterine cancers. A large Danish study found a complicated picture, with slightly increased risk of breast cancer amongst women taking digoxin, but better prognostic features. The Nurses&#x27; Health Study found a similar slight increase of risk.

Digoxin inhibits the proliferation of many cancerous cell lines &quot;in vitro&quot;, but its relevance to cancer &quot;in vivo&quot; remains unclear.

<text>Bicycle messengers (also known as bike or cycle couriers) are people who work for courier companies (also known as messenger companies) carrying and delivering items by bicycle. Bicycle messengers are most often found in the central business districts of metropolitan areas. Courier companies use bike messengers because bicycle travel is less subject to unexpected holdups in city traffic jams, and is not deterred by parking limitations, fees or fines in high-density development that can hinder or prevent delivery by motor vehicle, thereby offering a predictable delivery time.

Because bicycle thefts are prevalent in many cities, a lock to secure the bike during deliveries is essential. U-locks are also popular. Messengers typically carry basic tools, weather-proof clothing and a street map. It is also common for messengers to carry storage clipboards for manifests, receipts, and/or other logistic documents.

==History==
Almost immediately after the development of the pedal-driven velocipede in the 1860s, people began to use the bicycle for delivery purposes. David V. Herlihy&#x27;s 2004 book on the early history of the bicycle contains several references to bicycle messengers working during the late 19th century, including a description of couriers employed by the Paris stock exchange in the 1870s. During the bicycle boom of the 1890s in the United States, Western Union employed a number of bicycle telegraph boys in New York City, San Francisco, and other large population centers.

One of the earliest recorded post-war American bicycle courier companies was founded by Carl Sparks, in San Francisco, in 1945. According to the San Francisco Bicycle Messenger Association, &quot;Sparkie&#x27;s went on to become Aero, which was bought out in 1998 [and] later absorbed into CitySprint.&quot; By the late 1970s, there were well-established companies offering bicycle messenger services in many major cities in the U.S.

In Europe, the bicycle had fallen out of favour as a means of delivery in the third quarter of the 20th century. It was not until 1983 that bicycle messengers made their reappearance in Europe. London&#x27;s &quot;On Yer Bike&quot; and &quot;Pedal-Pushers&quot; were pioneers of pedal over petrol, and the rest of the city&#x27;s courier companies followed suit. By the late 1980s, cycle couriers were a common sight in central London and a British manufacturer named a range of mountain-bikes for them, the Muddy Fox &#x27;Courier&#x27;. Entrepreneurs in continental Europe, some inspired by seeing couriers in the U.S. or in London, began to offer bicycle courier services in the late 1980s, and by 1993 there were sufficiently large numbers of bicycle couriers in Northern Europe and North America that over 400 attended the inaugural Cycle Messenger Championships in Berlin, Germany. Bicycle messengers have not become common in southern Europe, the heartland of world competitive cycling. There are very few bicycle couriers in Portugal, France, Spain, or Italy. Outside Europe and North America, there are now large bicycle messenger services in Japan, and also in New Zealand and Australia. More recently, several companies started offering bike messenger services in Central and South America, specifically in México City, México; San José, Costa Rica; Bogotá, Colombia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, Brazil.

==Demand for courier services==
Messengers carry a huge variety of items, from things that could not be sent by digital means (corporate gifts, original artwork, clothes for photoshoots, original signed documents) to mundane items that could easily be emailed, albeit without the air of importance attached to an express courier delivery. Messengers deliver digital content on optical media or hard disks because, despite high speed broadband connections, companies find it easier to send a disc than to work out how to transmit larger amounts of data than an email account can handle. Legal documents, various financial instruments and sensitive information are routinely sent by courier, reflecting a distrust of digital cryptography.

Commentators have claimed that technological innovation will significantly reduce the demand for same-day parcel delivery, predicting that the fax machine, and then the internet, would render the messenger business obsolete. There is still a demand for fast courier services, but there is certainly some truth in the predictions. Reliable data specifically relating to bicycle messenger occupational statistics is hard to find: the U.S. Department of Labor statistics does not track bicycle messengers specifically, and does not include &quot;independent contractors&quot; in statistics referenced for this industry occupation, but reports indicate the business is shrinking.

The gradual acceptance of electronic filing by U.S. courts has had a negative effect on the market. In San Francisco, bike messengers report a smaller work force coupled with decreased earnings. In New York City alone, the number of messengers dropped by approximately 1,000 between 1998 and 2008.

== Food delivery ==
Food delivery apps, such as DoorDash, Postmates, Grubhub and Uber Eats, have transformed food delivery in recent years. Food delivery with an app has led to new forms of exploitation for food deliverers.

As of 2021, there were about 70,000 food delivery workers in New York City. 

The purpose of food delivery apps is to get customers their food as fast as possible; this can lead to exploitation of workers. Additionally, delivery staff face dangers such as injuries in traffic, dooring, bicycle theft, and muggings.

==Working conditions==

The conditions of employment of bicycle messengers vary from country to country, city to city, and even company to company. Contracts governing the relationship between individual courier and company are subject as much to customary practice, as a local ordinance. In some places messengers are independent contractors paid on commission and do not receive benefits such as health insurance. In other places, they will be regular employees of the courier company enjoying all the benefits thereof.

The employment status of the bicycle messengers of one of the UK&#x27;s biggest same-day courier services, CitySprint, was challenged by the GMB trade union in December 2007. The challenge arose after the firm terminated the contract of one of its riders. The GMB sought to establish that more than 1,500 CitySprint operatives currently classified as self-employed sub-contractors should be re-classified as employees.

The job is poorly paid relative to the risk and effort required. In 2002, a Harvard Medical School study of injury rates among Boston bicycle messengers determined that the rate of injury requiring time off work among the sample group was more than thirteen times the U.S. average, and more than three times higher than the next highest group, workers in the meat-packing industry. Bike messengers have been killed while working in the United States. Eight bicycle messengers are known to have been killed while working in London between 1989 and 2003. Because payment is made at piece rates, it is hard to get reliable figures for messenger income. A study published in 2006 stated that the average daily wage of London bicycle messengers was £65 a day, and that of bicycle messenger in Cardiff was £45. The UK legal minimum wage at that time was £5.52 an hour.

==Licensing==
In most cities, there are no legal requirements beyond those applying to all cyclists. Some jurisdictions, though, require the licensing of courier bicycles. In Calgary, Alberta for example, metal license plates must be fixed to bicycles used for courier work. Vancouver, British Columbia additionally requires bicycle messengers to complete a test in order to obtain a license, and to carry an identification card. In the United States, the state of Massachusetts requires that bicycle messengers in Boston are licensed and display an assigned license number on a city-issued plate.

==Equipment==
The most essential piece of equipment for a bicycle messenger is a bicycle. Some large cities that employ significant numbers of bike messengers (e.g., New York City) have relatively flat terrain, and are especially conducive to the performance properties of fixed-gear bicycles.

The majority of messengers use a bag to carry deliveries and personal effects. Bags with a single strap that wraps diagonally across the chest (popularly known as messenger bag) are popular because they can be swung around the messenger&#x27;s body to allow access without removing the bag. Clasps which can be adjusted with one hand (ideal for riding), clips, pockets, and webbing loops on the strap for holding a cell phone or two-way radio and other equipment also feature on purpose-built messenger bags. Bags generally have large capacities (up to 50 liters or 3,000 cubic inches). Baskets and racks mounted on the bike are also used, and at least one messenger service (in New York City) equips its riders with specialized three-wheel cycles (sometimes known as cargo-trikes), with a large trunk in the rear. Besides cargo-trikes, many messengers choose to ride various forms of cargo bikes for delivering large objects or high volumes of deliveries. Some bicycle messengers also wear helmets and dismount lights and fenders (mudguards) from stock bicycles.

==Communications==
Messengers communicate and are dispatched to assignments via hand-held communication devices including two-way radios, cell phones, and personal digital assistants. Many of the larger messenger services equip their riders with GPS tracking devices, for ease of location.
Usage of digital platforms is now common practice.

==Messenger culture and influence==

===Media===
Messengers have been used in fiction media as symbols of urban living, and have been the subject of novels, memoirs, feature films, television series, comic books, and sociological studies. Mexican artist José Guadalupe Posada created a popular icon of a marijuana-smoking bicycle courier everyman in his 19th-century engravings.

The 1986 film &quot;Quicksilver&quot; featuring a bicycle messenger, is an early expression of the mythology of the messenger as a daredevil stunt rider. Star Kevin Bacon rides a racing bike, a fixed gear bike and a trick bike with 1:1 gear ratio and zero-rake forks, to perform the stunts in the film. The 2000–2002 television series &quot;Dark Angel&quot; had the main character Max Guevara, played by Jessica Alba, as a bicycle messenger at a courier service named Jam Pony. The show took place in a post-apocalyptic Seattle where motorized transportation was costly and therefore couriers were more prevalent and bicycle messengers were seen as a prominent position. The 2012 film &quot;Premium Rush&quot;, starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, is also set in the world of bike messengers. In the TV show &quot;Suits&quot;, Patrick J. Adams often has flashback scenes to his previous job as a bike messenger. The main character of the game &quot;inFAMOUS&quot; is also a bike messenger who possesses amazing skills in parkour and urban exploration.

News media have made portrayals of messengers ranging from innocuous urban libertines to reckless, cliquish nihilists. The latter portrayal is often sparked by local incidents involving bike messengers in collisions with other road-users or run-ins with authority figures. These incidents also occasionally lead to proposals for, and dispute over, new ordinances and regulations on messengers and messengering.

===Fashion===
The influence of bicycle messengers can be seen in urban fashion, most notably the popularity of single-strap messenger bags, which are a common accessory among people who do not ride a bicycle regularly. The rise in popularity of fixed-gear bicycles in the mid-2000s, complete with affectations such as spoke cards (gathered from &quot;alleycats&quot; typically), is attributed to bicycle messengers. Casquettes, or cycling caps, are available in many designs and patterns, and are worn when not cycling or by non-cyclists as fashion items.

===Events===
Since 1993, Cycle Messenger World Championships, CMWCs, have taken place at national, continental and world levels. These events are held as much for fun and messenger networking as for competition. Bicycle messengers also take part in formal cycle competitions at all levels, and in all disciplines. Nelson Vails, silver medalist on the velodrome in the 1984 Olympics, worked as a bicycle messenger in New York City in the early 1980s. Ivonne Kraft, who competed in the 2004 Olympic cross country mountain bike race, is a multiple former Cycle Messenger World Champion, and worked as a bicycle messenger in Germany for a number of years.

<text>Peter Gosselin Fitzgerald (born October 20, 1960) is a retired American lawyer and politician who served as a United States Senator from Illinois. A member of the Republican Party, he served from 1999 to 2005. Fitzgerald defeated Democratic incumbent Carol Moseley Braun in 1998, becoming the first Republican to win a U.S. Senate race in Illinois since Charles Percy twenty years earlier. He had previously served in the Illinois State Senate from 1993 to 1998.

Known as a maverick for his willingness to break party lines, Fitzgerald retired from the Senate in 2005 and was succeeded by Barack Obama. After retiring from politics, he and his wife moved to McLean, Virginia. The son of millionaire banking magnate Gerald Francis Fitzgerald, Peter founded Chain Bridge Bank in 2007.

==Early life==
Born in Elgin, Illinois, one of five children of Gerald Francis and Marjorie (née Gosselin) Fitzgerald, Fitzgerald spent most of his life in Inverness, a northwestern suburb of Chicago.

He graduated from Portsmouth Abbey School, a Catholic boarding school in 1978, and from Dartmouth College in 1982. He completed his post-graduate studies as a Rotary Scholar at Aristotelian University in Greece, and earned his J.D. degree from the University of Michigan in 1986. His family has been continuously involved in commercial banking since the mid-1940s. His father built Suburban Bancorp, a chain of suburban banks, by aggressively founding and buying banks around the Chicago suburbs, which he sold in 1994 to a subsidiary of the Bank of Montreal for $246 million. Fitzgerald ran for the Illinois House of Representatives in 1988, but lost the Republican primary to James M. Kirkland by 1.15%.

==Political career==

===State Senate===
Fitzgerald was first elected to the state Senate in 1992. He was a member of a group of conservative state senators elected in 1992. They often challenged the leadership of the Illinois Republican Party and were dubbed the &quot;Fab Five.&quot; The group also included Steve Rauschenberger, Dave Syverson, Patrick O&#x27;Malley and Chris Lauzen.

===1994 congressional bid===

Fitzgerald challenged long-time incumbent Republican congressman Phil Crane in the 1994 Republican primary for the 8th Illinois congressional district. In a multi-candidate field, Fitzgerald lost to Crane 40% to 33%.

===1998 senatorial campaign===

Fitzgerald announced his intention to challenge one-term Democratic incumbent U.S. Senator Carol Moseley Braun in the 1998 election. He faced Illinois Comptroller Loleta Didrickson in the Republican primary. Didrickson had the support of the state Republican party, including Governor Jim Edgar and former Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole, who served as her national campaign chairman. A hard-fought primary ensued, and Fitzgerald narrowly defeated the establishment candidate, becoming the Republican nominee.

Despite great support from Republicans and Independents, he had alienated some of the party establishment during the primary. Meanwhile, Braun was helped by notable Democrats such as First Lady Hillary Clinton and U.S. Congressman Luis V. Gutierrez; final polling had the candidates running even. Fitzgerald defeated Moseley Braun in the general election by a 2.9% margin.

He was the first Republican in Illinois to win a U.S. Senate race in 20 years and the only Republican challenger in the country to defeat an incumbent Democratic senator in the 1998 election cycle.

===Senate tenure===

Fitzgerald had two major moments in the spotlight in the Senate, the first in 2000 when he filibustered a massive federal spending bill because it included funds for the Lincoln Presidential Library in Springfield. He accused Republican governor George Ryan, who later served a six-and-a-half-year prison sentence on a corruption conviction, of opposing competitive bidding so he could dole money to political allies, saying &quot;I want Illinois to get a $150 million (Abraham Lincoln) library, not a $50 million library that just happens to cost $150 million.&quot; His second major moment was following the September 11, 2001 attacks, when Congress quickly passed a massive bailout measure for most of the major airlines, which were in trouble financially. Standing alone out of all members of the U.S. Senate, Fitzgerald delivered a speech, &quot;Who will bail out the American taxpayer&quot;, arguing that the airlines would simply go through the money and remain financially unstable. The bill passed 96–1.

Fitzgerald was staunchly conservative on such issues as opposition to abortion (except to save the life of the mother), gay marriage and taxes, but on some issues he broke with his conservative colleagues, particularly environmental issues; he opposed drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge throughout his tenure in the Senate. Fitzgerald also supported &quot;reasonable&quot; gun control, immigration reform and the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform legislation.

Throughout his tenure in the Senate, Fitzgerald battled with the state Republican Party leadership. He insisted on the appointment of an out-of-state U.S. Attorney, Patrick Fitzgerald (unrelated) to investigate corruption in the Illinois state government. Though state party officials wanted a &quot;friendly&quot; attorney for Illinois, Fitzgerald insisted on someone who did not have friends or enemies in the Illinois government. Several indictments resulted, including that of former Republican Governor George Ryan, who was eventually convicted of several criminal abuses of authority, and Democratic Governor Rod Blagojevich, who many years later was convicted of attempting to sell the Senate seat vacated by Fitzgerald&#x27;s successor and future President Barack Obama. The scandal was seen as ensuring Illinois&#x27; reputation as one of the most politically corrupt states.

When the Republican establishment made clear that they would not support him for reelection, Fitzgerald announced he would retire at the end of his current term. Republicans nominated businessman Jack Ryan for the seat in the primaries. However, Ryan was later pressured by the Illinois Republican Party to withdraw because of publicity received from the contents of his previously-sealed divorce case. Fitzgerald stood by Ryan and supported him, despite the pressure from the media and the Illinois Republican party on Ryan to withdraw. Just 86 days before the election, the party drafted Maryland native Alan Keyes as the nominee. Keyes was accused of &quot;carpetbagging,&quot; and was defeated by Barack Obama by more than 40 percent of the vote. It has been stated that Fitzgerald, who was popular among independents, stood the best chance of retaining the seat and defeating Obama, who went on to win the presidential election just four years later. During his final months in office, Fox News ran an op-ed on Fitzgerald, &quot;Retiring Senator Stood Up for Principles.&quot;

==Post-political career==
Fitzgerald is the founder and Chairman of Chain Bridge Bank, N.A. in McLean, Virginia He serves on the board of trustees of the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, which is a museum dedicated to the U.S. Constitution.

<text>Alexa Ann McDonough ( Shaw; August 11, 1944 – January 15, 2022) was a Canadian politician who served as leader of the New Democratic Party from 1995 to 2003. She was the first woman to lead a major, recognized political party in Nova Scotia (the Nova Scotia New Democratic Party) from 1980 to 1994.

McDonough served as a member of the Nova Scotia Legislature from 1981 to 1994, representing the Halifax Chebucto and Halifax Fairview electoral districts. She stepped down as the NSNDP&#x27;s leader and as a member of the legislature in 1994. She subsequently ran for and was elected, leader of the federal New Democratic Party (NDP) in 1995. McDonough was elected the Member of Parliament (MP) for the federal electoral district of Halifax in 1997. She stepped down as party leader in 2003 but continued to serve as an MP for two more terms, until 2008, when she retired from politics altogether. In 2009, she became the interim president of Mount Saint Vincent University and was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada in December of that year.

==Early life and education==
McDonough was born Alexa Ann Shaw in Ottawa, Ontario, on August 11, 1944, at the Ottawa Civic Hospital. Her parents were Jean MacKinnon and Lloyd Robert Shaw, a wealthy businessman who was committed to progressive politics. He served as the first research director for the federal NDP&#x27;s predecessor, the national Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), and was an early financial backer of the NDP when it formed in 1961.

McDonough was involved in social activism from an early age, when, at 14, she led her church youth group in publicizing the conditions of Africville, a low-income, predominantly Black neighbourhood in Halifax. She attended Queen&#x27;s University in Kingston, Ontario, which was her family&#x27;s &quot;alma mater&quot;. After two years, she transferred to Dalhousie University in Halifax, where she completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology and psychology in 1965. She became a social worker and, during the 1970 Nova Scotia general election, worked for Gerald Regan&#x27;s Liberal Party, writing that party&#x27;s social policy platform. She quickly became disenchanted with Regan and the Liberals and joined the New Democratic Party in 1974.

==Provincial leadership==
McDonough&#x27;s first foray into electoral politics occurred during the 1979 and 1980 federal elections. In both of those elections, she ran unsuccessfully in the federal riding of Halifax. In the 1980 federal election, she lost to former Nova Scotia premier Gerald Regan, the same politician that she once supported back in 1970.

Just after the 1980 federal election, in the spring, Jeremy Akerman stepped down as the Nova Scotia NDP&#x27;s leader. At this time, there was a growing rift between the Cape Breton Island and Mainland wings of the party. This rift exploded in June, when Paul MacEwan, the NDP MLA for Cape Breton Nova, was expelled from the party due to his constant public airing of internal party disputes, including the implication that Akerman resigned due to &quot;Trotskyist elements&quot; from the mostly mainland-based provincial council. To make this situation worse for an incoming leader, the NDP&#x27;s four MLAs, all from Cape Breton constituencies, voted 3–1 to keep him in the caucus, with Len J. Arsenault – the MLA for Cape Breton North – being the only negative vote. MacEwan&#x27;s expulsion became one of the dominant issues during the leadership race that fall.

In late September, Akerman was appointed to a top Nova Scotia civil service job that required him to both resign from the Legislature and terminate his membership in the NDP. James &#x27;Buddy&#x27; MacEachern, a leadership candidate, and MLA for Cape Breton Centre, was made the interim leader on October 2.

Despite these internecine battles, and not having a seat in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly, McDonough decided to enter the leadership race. The other candidate in the race to replace Akerman was Arsenault. The leadership convention was convened in Halifax, with the leadership vote held on November 16, 1980. McDonough received 237 votes, compared to Arsenault&#x27;s 42 votes, and MacEachern&#x27;s 41 votes, giving her a first ballot landslide victory. As a result of her victory, she became the first woman in Canada to lead a major recognized political party.

McDonough&#x27;s first order of business was to settle the Paul MacEwan question. On December 9, 1980, she managed to get her former leadership rivals to vote MacEwan out of the caucus and party. Since she did not have a seat in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly, the party was left with just two seats, because MacEwan was now an independent, and Akerman&#x27;s seat was left vacant due to his resignation. For almost a year, she would sit in the Assembly&#x27;s visitors gallery until she could run for a seat in the 1981 Nova Scotia general election. McDonough&#x27;s first provincial election as leader was fought in the Halifax Chebucto riding, where the Liberals and Conservatives were more or less evenly matched in terms of voter support, and the NDP was a distant third in the previous election. McDonough won her seat, the first one for the NDP in Mainland Nova Scotia, but the NDP lost all of its Cape Breton Island seats in the process. She spent the next three years as the only New Democrat, and the only woman in the House of Assembly. She took on the &quot;old boys&#x27; network&quot;, that permeated Nova Scotia&#x27;s politics at the time, by attempting to dismantle the province&#x27;s entrenched patronage system.

McDonough was personally popular throughout Nova Scotia, consistently being the voters&#x27; top choice in leadership polls, but her popularity did not rub off on the party. She led the party through three more elections, eventually building the caucus up to three members: all from the mainland, including future Nova Scotia NDP leader, Robert Chisholm. After fourteen years as the Nova Scotia NDP leader, which at the time made her the longest-serving leader of a major political party, she stepped down on November 19, 1994. John Holm, the NDP&#x27;s Sackville-Cobequid MLA, took over as interim leader, until Chisholm was elected leader in 1996.

==Federal leadership==
As the fortunes of the Nova Scotia NDP were slowly rising during the mid-1990s, the same could not be said of its federal counterpart. The 1993 Canadian federal election was an unmitigated disaster for the NDP. Under Audrey McLaughlin&#x27;s leadership, the party suffered its worst defeat since the late 1950s, in terms of seats, when it was then called the CCF. When looking at the popular vote, it was the worst ever election for a federal social-democratic party in the 20th century, with just seven percent of the vote. The party only had nine seats, three short of the twelve seats needed to have official party status in the House of Commons, and all the extra funding, research, office space and Question Period privileges it accords.

In the aftermath of the 1993 election, the party set about reforming its policies and purpose, with McLaughlin announcing on April 18, 1994, that she would step down as leader by 1996. McLaughlin, faced with internal squabbles similar to those that occurred in the Nova Scotia party back in 1980, advanced her departure from the end of 1996 to the end of 1995. With an internal party atmosphere that could best be described as toxic, McDonough entered the leadership race in the spring of 1995. The conditions were similar to the ones she faced during her first leadership campaign in 1980: a divided party that was self-immolating. However, the party was also hobbled by unpopular provincial NDP governments in Ontario and British Columbia. Indeed, the NDP had suffered particularly severe losses in those two provinces at the federal level in 1993, losing all of its Ontario MPs, and all but two of its British Columbia MPs, more than half of its caucus.

Prior to the NDP leadership convention on October 14, 1995, McDonough was widely viewed as an also-ran behind the leading contenders, Svend Robinson and Lorne Nystrom, but at the convention she placed second on the first ballot, ahead of Nystrom in what was almost a three-way split. Although Robinson had placed first on that ballot, he felt that most of Nystrom&#x27;s supporters would go to McDonough on the second ballot, giving her the victory. Thus, he conceded to McDonough before a second ballot could be held. On a motion by Robinson, the convention formally acclaimed McDonough as the party&#x27;s new leader. McDonough became the first person from Atlantic Canada to lead a major party since Robert Stanfield retired as the Progressive Conservatives&#x27; leader in 1976. Unusually for a major-party leader, she did not have one of her MPs in a safe seat resign so she could get into Parliament via a by-election, opting instead to make a third bid for her home riding of Halifax in the next general election.

In the 1997 election, her first as leader, the party won 21 seats. This included a historic breakthrough in the Atlantic provinces, a region where it had only won three seats in its entire history prior to 1997. McDonough herself won Halifax by 11,000 votes, pushing Liberal incumbent Mary Clancy into third place. She would continue to win it consecutively three more times until she retired from politics in 2008.

During the next few years, McDonough&#x27;s leadership of the party elicited controversy. Union leaders were lukewarm in their support of her, often threatening to break away from the NDP, in particular the Canadian Auto Workers&#x27; president Buzz Hargrove. She was widely seen within the NDP as trying to pull the party toward the centre of the political spectrum, in the Third Way mode of Tony Blair although when she made her leader&#x27;s speech at the party&#x27;s August 1999 Ottawa policy convention, she attempted to distance herself from &quot;Third Way&quot; policies by stating: &quot;We must lay out a new way for Canadians to navigate in the 21st century. Not an old way, not a &#x27;third way&#x27;, but a made-in-Canada way...&quot; A vote on a resolution to adopt Third Way policies in the party&#x27;s platform formally was defeated, as many union leaders opposed it and McDonough&#x27;s &quot;Canadian Way&quot;.

The Canadian Alliance and its new leader, Stockwell Day, presented a further challenge to McDonough&#x27;s NDP. Fearful of the prospect of an Alliance government, many NDP supporters moved to the Liberals. As well, two NDP MPs, Angela Vautour and Rick Laliberte, crossed the floor to other party caucuses, reducing the NDP caucus to 19 seats. In the 2000 federal election, the NDP was held to just 13 seats, and its 8.5 percent of the popular vote, was near its historic low from the 1993 campaign. About the only solace the NDP and McDonough could take from the 2000 campaign was that they kept official party status in the House of Commons (if only barely), unlike McLaughlin in the 1993 campaign.

After the disappointing performance in the 2000 federal election, there were more calls for party renewal. Some party activists perceived that the NDP had moved to the centre of the political spectrum and wanted to change that by bringing in social/political activists outside of the parliamentary process. They called their movement the New Politics Initiative, or NPI.&lt;ref name= &quot;NPI/NDProgress&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Another group, called NDProgress, wanted to reform the party&#x27;s internal structures, with procedural changes to how leaders were elected and limiting how much control Labour Unions had in the party. The NPI proposal to create a new party from the ashes of the NDP, was opposed by McDonough, and by former NDP leader, Ed Broadbent. The NPI resolution was voted down when it was presented at the party&#x27;s November 2001 Winnipeg policy convention. NDProgress&#x27;s resolution to have a &quot;one member one vote&quot; election for party leader, with a provision to limit organized labour&#x27;s allotment of ballots to a maximum of 25 percent, passed. The 2001 Winnipeg convention was also where McDonough easily defeated a leadership challenge by Socialist Caucus member Marcel Hatch, who was also an NPI supporter.

The issue that highlighted McDonough&#x27;s federal leadership occurred during the twilight of her career: the fight against Islamophobia and general anti-Arab sentiment, which swept through Canada and the United States in the wake of the 9/11 attacks in September 2001. She led the charge on the national scene to repatriate Mahar Arar, an Arab-Canadian who was wrongly detained as a terrorist by United States border officials, on an erroneous tip from Canada&#x27;s secret service. Throughout 2002 and 2003, McDonough campaigned for his release. When he was released, his wife, Monia Mazigh, joined the NDP and became a candidate for them in the 2004 federal election, out of recognition for the support McDonough and the party showed for her and her husband.

With Brian Masse&#x27;s May 2002 by-election victory, in the Windsor West riding, the party&#x27;s caucus grew to 14 members. A few weeks later, on June 5, 2002, McDonough used this positive turn in electoral fortunes to announce that she was stepping down as NDP leader. On January 25, 2003, at the Toronto leadership convention, she was succeeded by Jack Layton. She was re-elected to Parliament in the 2004 federal election and again in 2006. In the NDP&#x27;s shadow cabinet, McDonough served as the critic for International Development, International Cooperation and Peace Advocacy.

==Retirement==
On June 2, 2008, McDonough announced that she would not run again in the riding of Halifax in the next federal election. She made the announcement at the Lord Nelson Hotel, the same place where she celebrated her 1997 victory as the MP for Halifax. McDonough said that she would continue on as the MP for Halifax until the next federal election.

On June 29, 2009, it was announced that McDonough was named the new interim president of Mount Saint Vincent University, in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Her one-year appointment began in August 2009. It was announced on December 30, 2009, that she was to be appointed an officer of the Order of Canada for her pioneering work as both the Nova Scotia and Federal leader of the New Democratic Party. She received an honorary Doctor of Civil Laws degree from Acadia University, in Wolfville, Nova Scotia on May 13, 2012.

==Personal life and death==
McDonough&#x27;s only marriage was in 1966 to Halifax lawyer, Peter McDonough (April 1, 1940 – November 17, 2021), with whom she had two sons: Justin and Travis. In 1993, she separated from McDonough, later divorcing him; she said her political career did not play a part in it. In 1994, just before she stepped down as Nova Scotia leader, she had a hysterectomy, and waited until she recuperated before she announced her resignation. During her time as leader of the federal NDP, McDonough was romantically involved with David MacDonald, a former Progressive Conservative (PC) MP for Toronto Centre—Rosedale and a cabinet minister. MacDonald ran as the NDP candidate in Toronto Centre—Rosedale in the 1997 election; in the previous election, he was the PC incumbent, and like every other PC candidate in Ontario in 1993, was defeated. The pair split up prior to the 2004 federal election.

On May 3, 2013, McDonough announced that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer about four months earlier during a mammogram. She had been receiving treatment.

McDonough died at a long-term care home in Halifax, on January 15, 2022, at the age of 77. She suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in the seven years prior to her death.

<doc id="334966" wikidata="Q423890" url="?curid=334966" title="Digitoxin">
<text>Digitoxin is a cardiac glycoside used for the treatment of heart failure and certain kinds of heart arrhythmia. It is a phytosteroid and is similar in structure and effects to digoxin, though the effects are longer-lasting. Unlike digoxin, which is eliminated from the body via the kidneys, it is eliminated via the liver, and so can be used in patients with poor or erratic kidney function. While several controlled trials have shown digoxin to be effective in a proportion of patients treated for heart failure, the evidence base for digitoxin is not as strong, although it is presumed to be similarly effective.

==Medical uses==
Digitoxin is used for the treatment of heart failure, especially in people with impaired kidney function. It is also used to treat certain kinds of heart arrhythmia, such as atrial fibrillation.

==Contraindications==
Contraindications include
* problems with the heart rhythm, such as severe bradycardia (slow heartbeat), ventricular tachycardia (fast heartbeat caused by the ventricles), ventricular fibrillation, or first- to second-degree atrioventricular block,
* and certain electrolyte imbalances: hypokalemia (low blood potassium levels), hypomagnesemia (low magnesium), and hypercalcemia (high calcium).

==Adverse effects and toxicity==
Digitoxin exhibits similar toxic effects to digoxin, namely: anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, confusion, visual disturbances, and cardiac arrhythmias. Antidigoxin antibody fragments, the specific treatment for digoxin poisoning, are also effective in serious digitoxin toxicity.

==Interactions==
Drugs that can increase digitoxin toxicity include:
* calcium
* substances that lower potassium or magnesium levels, such as diuretics and corticosteroids
* inhibitors of the liver enzyme CYP3A4, which slow down digitoxin metabolism; examples are the antibiotic clarithromycin, the antifungal itraconazole, and grapefruit juice
* inhibitors of the transporter protein P-gp, such as clarithromycin
* Beta blockers add to the bradycardia (slow heartbeat) caused by digitoxin.

Drugs that can decrease the effectivity of digitoxin include:
* substances that increase potassium levels, such as potassium sparing diuretics
* inducers of CYP3A4 or P-gp, such as phenytoin, rifampicin and St John&#x27;s Wort
* substances that bind digitoxin in the gut, such as aluminium containing antacids or colestyramine

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===

Digitoxin inhibits the sodium-potassium ATPase in heart muscle cells, resulting in increased force of contractions (positive inotropic), reduced speed of electric conduction (negative dromotropic), increased excitability (positive bathmotropic), and reduced frequency of heartbeat (negative chronotropic).

===Pharmacokinetics===
The drug is almost completely absorbed from the gut. When in the bloodstream, 90 to 97% are bound to plasma proteins. Digitoxin undergoes enterohepatic circulation. It is metabolized in part by CYP3A4; metabolites include digitoxigenin, digoxin (&gt;2%), and conjugate esters. In healthy people, 60% are eliminated via the kidneys and 40% via the faeces. In people with impaired kidney function, elimination via the faeces is increased. The biological half-life is 7 to 8 days except when kidney &quot;and&quot; liver functions are impaired, in which case it is usually longer.

==History==
The first description of the use of foxglove dates back to 1775. For quite some time, the active compound was not isolated. Oswald Schmiedeberg was able to obtain a pure sample in 1875. The modern therapeutic use of this molecule was made possible by the works of the pharmacist and the French chemist Claude-Adolphe Nativelle (1812–1889). The first structural analysis was done by Adolf Otto Reinhold Windaus in 1925, but the full structure with an exact determination of the sugar groups was not accomplished until 1962.

== Use as a weapon ==
Digitoxin has been used for at least 7,000 years as an arrow poison. Marie Alexandrine Becker, a Belgian serial killer, was sentenced to death for poisoning eleven people with digitoxin.

=== In fiction ===
Digitoxin is used as a poison or murder weapon in:
* Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;Appointment with Death&quot;
* Elizabeth Peters&#x27; &quot;Die For Love&quot;
* &quot;&quot;, season 9, episode 19: &quot;The Descent of Man&quot;
* &quot;Rosewood&quot; season 2, episode 20: &quot;Calliphoridae and Country Roads&quot;
* &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (2006)
* &quot;Uneasy Lies the Crown&quot; on &quot;Columbo&quot;, season 9, episode 5 (1990)
* &quot;Affair of the Heart&quot; on &quot;McMillan and Wife&quot;, season 6, episode 5 (1977)
* &quot;Murder 101&quot;: &quot;College can be a Murder&quot;
* Several episodes of Murder She Wrote.
* Private Practice, season 4, episode 18: “The Hardest Part”

In The Decemberists&#x27;s song, &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Song&quot; on &quot;The Hazards of Love&quot; album, the narrator murders his daughter by feeding her foxglove.

In Metal gear Solid V the phantom pain, venom snake uses digitalis to obtain digoxin for tranquilizer rounds to incapacitate enemies.

== Research ==
Digitoxin and related cardenolides display anticancer activity against a range of human cancer cell lines in vitro but the clinical use of digitoxin to treat cancer has been restricted by its narrow therapeutic index. Digitoxin glycorandomization led to the discovery of novel digitoxigenin neoglycosides which displayed improved anticancer potency and reduced inotropic activity (the perceived mechanism of general toxicity).

<doc id="334975" wikidata="Q7345303" url="?curid=334975" title="Robert Harvey (footballer)">
<text>Robert Jeffrey Harvey (born 21 August 1971) is an Australian rules football coach and former player. He is currently an assistant coach for the St Kilda Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL). As a player, he played his entire career with St Kilda in the AFL. Following retirement, Harvey embarked on a career in assistant coaching which has spanned across three decades, highlighted by a nine-game stint as caretaker head coach of the Collingwood Football Club in 2021.

Harvey was recognised as one of the top 50 players of all time in &quot;The Australian Game of Football,&quot; a book commissioned by the AFL in 2008 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Australian rules football. The list was compiled by &quot;Herald Sun&quot; journalist Mike Sheahan. Harvey was known for his running ability and considered one of the best short passes of 15 to 30 metres in the history of the game. He holds St Kilda&#x27;s record for most career games. At his retirement, at the end of the 2008 AFL season, Harvey had played the third-highest total career games in league history, with 383 games. Currently, he ranks seventh in games played; Harvey was also the final active player from the VFL era of the league (pre-1990) to retire.

Harvey won numerous individual awards and medals during his playing career. He won consecutive Brownlow Medals, the league&#x27;s highest individual honour, in 1997 and 1998. He won St Kilda&#x27;s best and fairest award—now called the Trevor Barker Award—in 1992, 1994, 1997 and 1998. He was selected in the All-Australian team eight times, with his first All-Australian award being in 1992 and his last in 2003. He won three E. J. Whitten Medals, awarded to the player judged best player on the ground for Victoria in State of Origin matches; the 1997 AFL Players Association Most Valuable Player Award (now known as the Leigh Matthews Trophy); and the Michael Tuck Medal for player judged best on ground in the 2004 pre-season cup final. In 2012, Harvey was inducted in the Australian Football Hall of Fame. On 24 September 2013, Harvey was named the AFL’s Assistant Coach of the Year at the AFL Coaches Association awards presentation.

Harvey is the grandson of former Australian test cricketer Merv Harvey and grandnephew of Neil Harvey, who was Australia&#x27;s leading run-scorer and century-maker behind Don Bradman. His younger brother, Anthony Harvey, played four games for St Kilda in 1994 before captaining Norwood to the 1997 SANFL premiership.

==Playing career==
===St Kilda===

====Early career: 1988–1993====
Harvey was recruited from St Kilda&#x27;s then-VCFL zone Seaford and played his first senior game for St Kilda against Footscray at the Western Oval in round 19, 1988. Harvey played in the 1991 St Kilda team that qualified for the finals series for the first time since 1973. He was a vital player in St Kilda team that qualified for that year&#x27;s final series and had the club&#x27;s first finals&#x27; win since 1973. He won St Kilda&#x27;s 1992 award for the best and fairest player (now called the Trevor Barker Award) and was selected in the All-Australian team for the first time.

====Rising career: 1994–1996====
In 1994, he played his 100th premiership season match against North Melbourne in Round 2. He also won his second St Kilda best and fairest award and was selected in the All-Australian team for a second time. In 1995, he was again selected in the All-Australian team for a third selection. Harvey played in St Kilda’s 1996 Ansett Australia Cup winning side, the club&#x27;s first pre-season cup win. He was also selected for the fourth time in the All-Australian Team. 

====Brownlow Medals and captain: 1997–2003====
Harvey played in all 22 matches in the 1997 AFL regular season in which St Kilda qualified in first position for the finals series, winning the club’s second minor premiership and first McClelland Trophy. St Kilda qualified for the 1997 AFL grand final after wins in the qualifying and preliminary finals. Harvey played in the grand final in which St Kilda was defeated by 31 points. 

Harvey gained 756 disposals in 1997 which, at the time, was the highest single-season tally on record—an average of 30 possessions per game. He was recognised for his excellent season with numerous awards. He again won St Kilda&#x27;s best and fairest award and was also selected again in the 1997 All-Australian team—his fifth All-Australian honour. He also won the 1997 AFL Players Association Most Valuable Player Award (now the Leigh Matthews Trophy) and the league&#x27;s highest individual award, the Brownlow Medal. Chris Grant gained the most votes; however, Grant was ineligible to win the award due to a one-match suspension for striking Hawthorn&#x27;s Nick Holland. 

Harvey played in the St Kilda side that again qualified for the 1998 finals series. He played his 200th premiership season match that year against in round 21 at Waverley Park. St Kilda was eliminated from the finals after two consecutive losses. Harvey amassed 501 kicks in 1998 which, at the time, was the highest single-season tally on record. He again won the league&#x27;s highest individual award, the Brownlow Medal, for a second consecutive season. As of 2020, Harvey is the last man to win two consecutive Brownlow Medals. He also won the Trevor Barker Award for St Kilda&#x27;s best and fairest player for a second consecutive year—his fourth best-and-fairest award. Harvey was also again selected in the year&#x27;s All-Australian team, his sixth All-Australian award. 

Harvey was selected in the 1999 All-Australian Team—the sixth consecutive year he received an All-Australian selection and his seventh career All-Australian honour. Harvey was named captain of St Kilda for the 2001 and 2002 seasons. He was selected in the 2003 All-Australian team, his eighth All-Australian award. He was also named in St Kilda&#x27;s Team of the Century (1900–1999) in 2003. 

====Later career and records: 2004–2007====
Harvey played in St Kilda’s 2004 Wizard Home Loans Cup final winning side – the club&#x27;s second pre-season cup win. He was judged best on ground in the final and awarded the Michael Tuck Medal. St Kilda won a then club record 10 consecutive matches in the first 10 rounds of the 2004 AFL season. The club went on to qualify for the finals inside the top four. After a qualifying final loss and a semi-final win, Harvey played his 300th game and became the fourth player to play 300 games for St Kilda, in a preliminary final against Port Adelaide. St Kilda were eliminated from the finals series after a six-point loss. 

In round 7, 2006 against , in front of a near full house at Docklands Stadium, Harvey broke the all-time games record for St Kilda (until then held by Nathan Burke) when he played in his 324th premiership season match. To celebrate, the Saints wore special guernseys with Harvey&#x27;s silhouetted image in the centre. Harvey reached his 350th game against West Coast at Subiaco Oval in round 12, 2007, when the Saints defeated the reigning premiers by 23 points. 

====21st season and retirement: 2008====
To begin what would be his final season, Harvey played in St Kilda’s 2008 NAB Cup final winning side, which was the club&#x27;s third pre-season cup win. By the beginning of the regular season, Harvey became the first player to ever play in 21 consecutive VFL/AFL seasons (since overtaken by Dustin Fletcher&#x27;s current record of 23 seasons). At 37 years of age, he played in 24 of St Kilda&#x27;s 25 premiership season matches—including three finals—averaging 21 disposals per game. He had 31 disposals in another best-on-ground performance in St Kilda&#x27;s Round 13 win against Fremantle. 

St Kilda qualified for the 2008 finals series inside the top four for the third time in five years. After a qualifying final loss and a semi-final win, Harvey lined up for St Kilda in what turned out to be his final game in the AFL on 20 September 2008 in a preliminary final against Hawthorn at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, which St Kilda lost by 54 points. Harvey was chaired off the ground by teammates Lenny Hayes and Max Hudghton to a respectful ovation, while players and officials from both sides formed a guard of honour. After the game, a tribute to his long career was played on the big screen. 

Harvey ended his career having played 383 games at the top level for over 21 seasons, from the age of 16 until he was 37, the second-longest senior career (in terms of seasons) in VFL/AFL history. The only players (at the time) to have played over 400 games in the VFL/AFL, Michael Tuck and Kevin Bartlett, both expressed their disappointment at what they both thought was a premature retirement, believing Harvey could have followed in their footsteps and reached the elusive 400-game milestone. 

Harvey received 215 Brownlow Medal votes during his career, the second-highest tally of any player in league history. He was also the only player in league history to have received Brownlow Medal votes in more than 100 games. He holds the record for most games played without winning a premiership, but he did participate in 17 finals series matches, including one grand final. He was the last remaining VFL/AFL player left who had played in the 1980s.
===State of Origin===
Harvey had a prolific State of Origin career. He first played for Victoria in 1991, against South Australia, kicking two goals. The following year, he was named in the best players against Western Australia and won the E. J. Whitten Medal against South Australia, kicking one goal in the match. In 1993, he participated in the State of Origin Carnival, performing on the big stage in the Grand Final, again winning the E. J. Whitten Medal. He was selected in 1995 against South Australia. In 1996, he won the E. J. Whitten Medal for a record third time, against The Allies, kicking one goal.

==Coaching career==
===Carlton Football Club assistant coach (2009-2010)===
On 10 October 2008, it was announced that Harvey was appointed in an assistant coaching position as a development and fitness coach at the Carlton Football Club from 2009. On 2 November 2009, he was promoted from development coach to midfield coach at Carlton and served as a more direct assistant coach under senior coach Brett Ratten.

===St Kilda Football Club assistant coach (2011)===
It was formally announced by the Carlton and St Kilda football clubs, on 13 September 2010, that Harvey had accepted an offer to return to St Kilda as an assistant coach beginning with the 2011 pre-season, in the position of St Kilda midfield coach under senior coach Ross Lyon. Following Ross Lyon&#x27;s departure from the Saints in mid-September 2011, Harvey assumed the role as caretaker senior coach while the search for a new senior coach commenced at St Kilda. On being overlooked for St Kilda&#x27;s senior coaching role in favour of Scott Watters, Harvey was released from his assistant coaching obligations with St Kilda.

===Collingwood Football Club assistant coach (2012-2021)===
Harvey joined the Collingwood Football Club in October 2011 in an assistant coaching role as midfield coach under senior coach Nathan Buckley and was promoted to senior assistant coach during 2013. On 24 September 2013, Harvey was named the AFL&#x27;s Assistant Coach of the Year at the AFL Coaches Association awards.

===Collingwood Football Club caretaker senior coach (2021)===
After Nathan Buckley resigned as Collingwood Football Club senior coach in June 2021, Harvey assumed the role as caretaker senior coach, effective from round 14 of the 2021 AFL season. Harvey coached Collingwood to a total of nine games with two wins and seven losses, and then Collingwood finished in seventeenth place (second-last) position on the ladder in the 2021 season. Harvey then left the club at the end of the 2021 season, after he came to a mutual agreement with the club that a change was needed for both parties in the decision that Harvey would not be retained as Collingwood Football Club senior coach. Harvey described the discussions as “pretty transparent” and that he left “on good terms”. Harvey was replaced by Craig McRae as Collingwood Football Club senior coach.

===Hawthorn Football Club assistant coach (2022)===
On 22 September 2021, it was announced that Harvey would join as an assistant coach under senior coach Sam Mitchell.

===St Kilda Football Club assistant coach (2023-present)===
Following the appointment of Ross Lyon as senior coach of St Kilda, when Lyon returned in his second stint as Saints senior coach, it was announced in October 2022 that Harvey would be returning to St Kilda as an assistant coach under senior coach Ross Lyon.

==Personal life==
Harvey is married to Danielle Harvey. Danielle appeared on Fox Footy&#x27;s &quot;Living With Footballers&quot; before it was cancelled at the end of 2004. They have three children: son Connor and daughters Remi and Alyssa.

<text>A townhouse, townhome, town house, or town home, is a type of terraced housing. A modern townhouse is often one with a small footprint on multiple floors. In a different British usage, the term originally referred to any type of city residence (normally in London) of someone whose main or largest residence was a country house.

==History==
Historically, a townhouse was the city residence of a noble or wealthy family, who would own one or more country houses in which they lived for much of the year. From the 18th century, landowners and their servants would move to a townhouse during the social season (when major balls took place).

==Europe==

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom, most townhouses are terraced. Only a small minority of them, generally the largest, were detached, but even aristocrats whose country houses had grounds of hundreds or thousands of acres often lived in terraced houses in town. For example, the Duke of Norfolk owned Arundel Castle in the country, while his London house, Norfolk House, was a terraced house in St James&#x27;s Square over wide.

==North America==
===U.S. and Canada===
In the United States and Canada, a townhouse has two connotations. The older predates the automobile and denotes a house on a small footprint in a city, but because of its multiple floors (sometimes six or more), it has a large living space, often with servants&#x27; quarters. The small footprint of the townhouse allows it to be within walking or mass-transit distance of business and industrial areas of the city, yet luxurious enough for wealthy residents of the city.

Townhouses are expensive where detached single-family houses are uncommon, such as in New York City, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, Montreal, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco.

&quot;Rowhouses&quot; are similar and consist of several adjacent, uniform units originally found in older, pre-automobile urban areas such as Baltimore, Maryland; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Richmond, Virginia; Charleston, South Carolina; Savannah, Georgia and New Orleans, Louisiana; but now found in lower-cost housing developments in suburbs as well. A rowhouse is where there is a continuous roof and foundation, and a single wall divides adjacent townhouses, but some have a double wall with inches-wide air space in between on a common foundation. A rowhouse will generally be smaller and less luxurious than a dwelling called a townhouse.

The name &quot;townhouse&quot; or &quot;townhome&quot; was later used to describe non-uniform units in suburban areas that are designed to mimic detached or semi-detached homes. Today, the term &quot;townhouse&quot; is used to describe units mimicking a detached home that are attached in a multi-unit complex. The distinction between living units called &quot;apartments&quot; and those called &quot;townhouses&quot; is that townhouses usually consist of multiple floors and have their own outside door as opposed to having only one level and/or having access via an interior corridor hallway or via an exterior balcony-style walkway (more common in the warmer climates). Another distinction is that in most areas of the US outside of the very largest cities, &quot;apartment&quot; refers to rental housing, and &quot;townhouse&quot; typically refers to an individually owned dwelling, with no other unit beneath or above although the term townhouse-style (rental) apartment is also heard for bi-level apartments.

Townhouses can also be &quot;stacked&quot;. Such homes have multiple units vertically (typically two), normally each with its own private entrance from the street or at least from the outside. They can be side by side in a row of three or more, in which case they are sometimes referred to as &quot;rowhouses&quot;. A townhouse in a group of two could be referred to as a townhouse, but in Canada and the US, it is typically called a semi-detached home and in some areas of western Canada, a half-duplex.

In Canada, single-family dwellings, be they any type, such as single-family detached homes, apartments, mobile homes, or townhouses, for example, are split into two categories of ownership:

* Condominium (strata title), where one owns the interior of the unit and also a specified share of the undivided interest of the remainder of the building and land known as &quot;common elements&quot;.
* Freehold, where one owns exclusively the land and the dwelling without any condominium aspects. These may share the foundation as well but have narrow air spaces between and still referred to as a townhouse.

Condominium townhouses, just like condominium apartments, are often referred to as &quot;condos&quot;, thus referring to the type of ownership rather than to the type of dwelling. Since apartment-style condos are the most common, when someone refers to a &quot;condo&quot;, many erroneously assume that it must be an apartment-style dwelling and that only apartment-style dwellings can be condos. All types of dwellings can be condos, and this is therefore true of townhouses. A brownstone townhouse is a particular variety found in New York.

==Asia, Australia, South Africa, Zimbabwe==
In Asia, Australia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, the usage of the term follows the North American sense. Townhouses are generally found in complexes. Large complexes often have high security, resort facilities such as swimming pools, gyms, parks and playground equipment. Typically, a townhouse has a strata title; i.e., a type of title where the common property (landscaped area, public corridors, building structure, etc.) is owned by a corporation of individual owners and the houses on the property are owned by the individual owners.

In population-dense Asian cities dominated by high-rise residential apartment blocks, such as Hong Kong, townhouses in private housing developments remain almost exclusively populated by the very wealthy due to the rarity and relatively large sizes of the units. Prominent examples in Hong Kong include Severn 8, in which a townhouse sold for HK$285 million (US$37 million) in 2008, or HK$57,000 (US$7,400) per square foot, a record in Asia, and The Beverly Hills, which consists of multiple rows of townhouses with some units as large as . Commonly in the suburbs of major cities, an old house on a large block of land is demolished and replaced by a short row of townhouses, built &#x27;end on&#x27; to the street for added privacy.

<text>2nd &quot;Carmeli&quot; Brigade (Hebrew: חטיבת כרמלי, Hativat Carmeli, former 165th Brigade) is a reserve infantry brigade of the Israel Defense Forces, part of the Northern Command. Today the brigade consists of four battalions, including one reconnaissance battalion.

== History ==
The brigade was formed on February 22, 1948, during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, when the Levanoni Brigade in the Galilee split into the 1st Golani Brigade and the 2nd Carmeli Brigade. In its early days, the brigade gained control over three battalions – the 21st, 22nd and 23rd – although, later during the war the 24th battalion was also established. It has since participated in all of Israel&#x27;s major wars and nearly all major operations, including the Sinai War, Six-Day War, War of Attrition, Yom Kippur War, Operation Litani, the first and second wars in Lebanon, the Israel–Hamas war with its ramifications, and various operations during the Palestinian intifadas.

<doc id="334986" wikidata="Q853848" url="?curid=334986" title="Allopatric speciation">
<text>Allopatric speciation () – also referred to as geographic speciation, vicariant speciation, or its earlier name the dumbbell model – is a mode of speciation that occurs when biological populations become geographically isolated from each other to an extent that prevents or interferes with gene flow.

Various geographic changes can arise such as the movement of continents, and the formation of mountains, islands, bodies of water, or glaciers. Human activity such as agriculture or developments can also change the distribution of species populations. These factors can substantially alter a region&#x27;s geography, resulting in the separation of a species population into isolated subpopulations. The vicariant populations then undergo genetic changes as they become subjected to different selective pressures, experience genetic drift, and accumulate different mutations in the separated populations&#x27; gene pools. The barriers prevent the exchange of genetic information between the two populations leading to reproductive isolation. If the two populations come into contact they will be unable to reproduce—effectively speciating. Other isolating factors such as population dispersal leading to emigration can cause speciation (for instance, the dispersal and isolation of a species on an oceanic island) and is considered a special case of allopatric speciation called peripatric speciation.

Allopatric speciation is typically subdivided into two major models: vicariance and peripatric. These models differ from one another by virtue of their population sizes and geographic isolating mechanisms. The terms &quot;allopatry&quot; and &quot;vicariance&quot; are often used in biogeography to describe the relationship between organisms whose ranges do not significantly overlap but are immediately adjacent to each other—they do not occur together or only occur within a narrow zone of contact. Historically, the language used to refer to modes of speciation directly reflected biogeographical distributions. As such, allopatry is a geographical distribution opposed to sympatry (speciation within the same area). Furthermore, the terms allopatric, vicariant, and geographical speciation are often used interchangeably in the scientific literature. This article will follow a similar theme, with the exception of special cases such as peripatric, centrifugal, among others.

Observation of nature creates difficulties in witnessing allopatric speciation from &quot;start-to-finish&quot; as it operates as a dynamic process. From this arises a host of issues in defining species, defining isolating barriers, measuring reproductive isolation, among others. Nevertheless, verbal and mathematical models, laboratory experiments, and empirical evidence overwhelmingly supports the occurrence of allopatric speciation in nature. Mathematical modeling of the genetic basis of reproductive isolation supports the plausibility of allopatric speciation; whereas laboratory experiments of &quot;Drosophila&quot; and other animal and plant species have confirmed that reproductive isolation evolves as a byproduct of natural selection.

== Vicariance model ==

The notion of vicariant evolution was first developed by Léon Croizat in the mid-twentieth century. The vicariance theory, which showed coherence along with the acceptance of plate tectonics in the 1960s, was developed in the early 1950s by this Venezuelan botanist, who had found an explanation for the similarity of plants and animals found in South America and Africa by deducing that they had originally been a single population before the two continents drifted apart.

Currently, speciation by vicariance is widely regarded as the most common form of speciation; and is the primary model of allopatric speciation. Vicariance is a process by which the geographical range of an individual taxon, or a whole biota, is split into discontinuous populations (disjunct distributions) by the formation of an extrinsic barrier to the exchange of genes: that is, a barrier arising externally to a species. These extrinsic barriers often arise from various geologic-caused, topographic changes such as: the formation of mountains (orogeny); the formation of rivers or bodies of water; glaciation; the formation or elimination of land bridges; the movement of continents over time (by tectonic plates); or island formation, including sky islands. Vicariant barriers can change the distribution of species populations. Suitable or unsuitable habitat may be come into existence, expand, contract, or disappear as a result of global climate change or even large scale human activities (for example, agricultural, civil engineering developments, and habitat fragmentation). Such factors can alter a region&#x27;s geography in substantial ways, resulting in the separation of a species population into isolated subpopulations. The vicariant populations may then undergo genotypic or phenotypic divergence as: (a) different mutations arise in the gene pools of the populations, (b) they become subjected to different selective pressures, and/or (c) they independently undergo genetic drift. The extrinsic barriers prevent the exchange of genetic information between the two populations, potentially leading to differentiation due to the ecologically different habitats they experience; selective pressure then invariably leads to complete reproductive isolation. Furthermore, a species&#x27; proclivity to remain in its ecological niche (see phylogenetic niche conservatism) through changing environmental conditions may also play a role in isolating populations from one another, driving the evolution of new lineages.

Allopatric speciation can be represented as the extreme on a gene flow continuum. As such, the level of gene flow between populations in allopatry would be formula_1, where formula_2 equals the rate of gene exchange. In sympatry formula_3 (panmixis), while in parapatric speciation, formula_4 represents the entire continuum, although some scientists argue that a classification scheme based solely on geographic mode does not necessarily reflect the complexity of speciation. Allopatry is often regarded as the default or &quot;null&quot; model of speciation, but this too is debated.

=== Reproductive isolation ===

Reproductive isolation acts as the primary mechanism driving genetic divergence in allopatry and can be amplified by divergent selection. Pre-zygotic and post-zygotic isolation are often the most cited mechanisms for allopatric speciation, and as such, it is difficult to determine which form evolved first in an allopatric speciation event. Pre-zygotic simply implies the presence of a barrier prior to any act of fertilization (such as an environmental barrier dividing two populations), while post-zygotic implies the prevention of successful inter-population crossing after fertilization (such as the production of an infertile hybrid). Since species pairs who diverged in allopatry often exhibit pre- and post-zygotic isolation mechanisms, investigation of the earliest stages in the life cycle of the species can indicate whether or not divergence occurred due to a pre-zygotic or post-zygotic factor. However, establishing the specific mechanism may not be accurate, as a species pair continually diverges over time. For example, if a plant experiences a chromosome duplication event, reproduction will occur, but sterile hybrids will result—functioning as a form of post-zygotic isolation. Subsequently, the newly formed species pair may experience pre-zygotic barriers to reproduction as selection, acting on each species independently, will ultimately lead to genetic changes making hybrids impossible. From the researcher&#x27;s perspective, the current isolating mechanism may not reflect the past isolating mechanism.

=== Reinforcement ===
Reinforcement has been a contentious factor in speciation. It is more often invoked in sympatric speciation studies, as it requires gene flow between two populations. However, reinforcement may also play a role in allopatric speciation, whereby the reproductive barrier is removed, reuniting the two previously isolated populations. Upon secondary contact, individuals reproduce, creating low-fitness hybrids. Traits of the hybrids drive individuals to discriminate in mate choice, by which pre-zygotic isolation increases between the populations. Some arguments have been put forth that suggest the hybrids themselves can possibly become their own species: known as hybrid speciation. Reinforcement can play a role in all geographic modes (and other non-geographic modes) of speciation as long as gene flow is present and viable hybrids can be formed. The production of inviable hybrids is a form of reproductive character displacement, under which most definitions is the completion of a speciation event.

Research has well established the fact that interspecific mate discrimination occurs to a greater extent between sympatric populations than it does in purely allopatric populations; however, other factors have been proposed to account for the observed patterns. Reinforcement in allopatry has been shown to occur in nature (evidence for speciation by reinforcement), albeit with less frequency than a classic allopatric speciation event. A major difficulty arises when interpreting reinforcement&#x27;s role in allopatric speciation, as current phylogenetic patterns may suggest past gene flow. This masks possible initial divergence in allopatry and can indicate a &quot;mixed-mode&quot; speciation event—exhibiting both allopatric and sympatric speciation processes.

=== Mathematical models ===
Developed in the context of the genetic basis of reproductive isolation, mathematical scenarios model both prezygotic and postzygotic isolation with respect to the effects of genetic drift, selection, sexual selection, or various combinations of the three. Masatoshi Nei and colleagues were the first to develop a neutral, stochastic model of speciation by genetic drift alone. Both selection and drift can lead to postzygotic isolation, supporting the fact that two geographically separated populations can evolve reproductive isolation—sometimes occurring rapidly. Fisherian sexual selection can also lead to reproductive isolation if there are minor variations in selective pressures (such as predation risks or habitat differences) among each population. (See the Further reading section below). Mathematical models concerning reproductive isolation-by distance have shown that populations can experience increasing reproductive isolation that correlates directly with physical, geographical distance. This has been exemplified in models of ring species; however, it has been argued that ring species are a special case, representing reproductive isolation-by distance, and demonstrate parapatric speciation instead—as parapatric speciation represents speciation occurring along a cline.

== Other models ==
Various alternative models have been developed concerning allopatric speciation. Special cases of vicariant speciation have been studied in great detail, one of which is peripatric speciation, whereby a small subset of a species population becomes isolated geographically; and centrifugal speciation, an alternative model of peripatric speciation concerning expansion and contraction of a species&#x27; range. Other minor allopatric models have also been developed are discussed below.

=== Peripatric ===

Peripatric speciation is a mode of speciation in which a new species is formed from an isolated peripheral population. If a small population of a species becomes isolated (&quot;e.g.&quot; a population of birds on an oceanic island), selection can act on the population independent of the parent population. Given both geographic separation and enough time, speciation can result as a byproduct. It can be distinguished from allopatric speciation by three important features: 1) the size of the isolated population, 2) the strong selection imposed by the dispersal and colonization into novel environments, and 3) the potential effects of genetic drift on small populations. However, it can often be difficult for researchers to determine if peripatric speciation occurred as vicariant explanations can be invoked due to the fact that both models posit the absence of gene flow between the populations. The size of the isolated population is important because individuals colonizing a new habitat likely contain only a small sample of the genetic variation of the original population. This promotes divergence due to strong selective pressures, leading to the rapid fixation of an allele within the descendant population. This gives rise to the potential for genetic incompatibilities to evolve. These incompatibilities cause reproductive isolation, giving rise to rapid speciation events. Models of peripatry are supported mostly by species distribution patterns in nature. Oceanic islands and archipelagos provide the strongest empirical evidence that peripatric speciation occurs.

=== Centrifugal ===
Centrifugal speciation is a variant, alternative model of peripatric speciation. This model contrasts with peripatric speciation by virtue of the origin of the genetic novelty that leads to reproductive isolation. When a population of a species experiences a period of geographic range expansion and contraction, it may leave small, fragmented, peripherally isolated populations behind. These isolated populations will contain samples of the genetic variation from the larger parent population. This variation leads to a higher likelihood of ecological niche specialization and the evolution of reproductive isolation. Centrifugal speciation has been largely ignored in the scientific literature. Nevertheless, a wealth of evidence has been put forth by researchers in support of the model, much of which has not yet been refuted. One example is the possible center of origin in the Indo-West Pacific.

=== Microallopatric ===

Microallopatry refers to allopatric speciation occurring on a small geographic scale. Examples of microallopatric speciation in nature have been described. Rico and Turner found intralacustrine allopatric divergence of &quot;Pseudotropheus callainos&quot; (&quot;Maylandia callainos&quot;) within Lake Malawi separated only by 35 meters. Gustave Paulay found evidence that species in the subfamily Cryptorhynchinae have microallopatrically speciated on Rapa and its surrounding islets. A sympatrically distributed triplet of diving beetle (&quot;Paroster&quot;) species living in aquifers of Australia&#x27;s Yilgarn region have likely speciated microallopatrically within a 3.5 km2 area. The term was originally proposed by Hobart M. Smith to describe a level of geographic resolution. A sympatric population may exist in low resolution, whereas viewed with a higher resolution (&quot;i.e.&quot; on a small, localized scale within the population) it is &quot;microallopatric&quot;. Ben Fitzpatrick and colleagues contend that this original definition, &quot;is misleading because it confuses geographical and ecological concepts&quot;.

=== Modes with secondary contact ===

Ecological speciation can occur allopatrically, sympatrically, or parapatrically; the only requirement being that it occurs as a result of adaptation to different ecological or micro-ecological conditions. Ecological allopatry is a reverse-ordered form of allopatric speciation in conjunction with reinforcement. First, divergent selection separates a non-allopatric population emerging from pre-zygotic barriers, from which genetic differences evolve due to the obstruction of complete gene flow. The terms allo-parapatric and allo-sympatric have been used to describe speciation scenarios where divergence occurs in allopatry but speciation occurs only upon secondary contact. These are effectively models of reinforcement or &quot;mixed-mode&quot; speciation events.

== Observational evidence ==
As allopatric speciation is widely accepted as a common mode of speciation, the scientific literature is abundant with studies documenting its existence. The biologist Ernst Mayr was the first to summarize the contemporary literature of the time in 1942 and 1963. Many of the examples he set forth remain conclusive; however, modern research supports geographic speciation with molecular phylogenetics—adding a level of robustness unavailable to early researchers. The most recent thorough treatment of allopatric speciation (and speciation research in general) is Jerry Coyne and H. Allen Orr&#x27;s 2004 publication &quot;Speciation&quot;. They list six mainstream arguments that lend support to the concept of vicariant speciation:
*Closely related species pairs, more often than not, reside in geographic ranges adjacent to one another, separated by a geographic or climatic barrier.
*Young species pairs (or sister species) often occur in allopatry, even without a known barrier.
*In occurrences where several pairs of related species share a range, they are distributed in abutting patterns, with borders exhibiting zones of hybridization.
*In regions where geographic isolation is doubtful, species do not exhibit sister pairs.
*Correlation of genetic differences between an array of distantly related species that correspond to known current or historical geographic barriers.
*Measures of reproductive isolation increase with the greater geographic distance of separation between two species pairs. (This has been often referred to as reproductive isolation by distance.)

=== Endemism ===

Allopatric speciation has resulted in many of the biogeographic and biodiversity patterns found on Earth: on islands, continents, and even among mountains.

Islands are often home to species endemics—existing only on an island and nowhere else in the world—with nearly all taxa residing on isolated islands sharing common ancestry with a species on the nearest continent. Not without challenge, there is typically a correlation between island endemics and diversity; that is, that the greater the diversity (species richness) of an island, the greater the increase in endemism. Increased diversity effectively drives speciation. Furthermore, the number of endemics on an island is directly correlated with the relative isolation of the island and its area. In some cases, speciation on islands has occurred rapidly.

Dispersal and &quot;in situ&quot; speciation are the agents that explain the origins of the organisms in Hawaii. Various geographic modes of speciation have been studied extensively in Hawaiian biota, and in particular, angiosperms appear to have speciated predominately in allopatric and parapatric modes.

Islands are not the only geographic locations that have endemic species. South America has been studied extensively with its areas of endemism representing assemblages of allopatrically distributed species groups. &quot;Charis&quot; butterflies are a primary example, confined to specific regions corresponding to phylogenies of other species of butterflies, amphibians, birds, marsupials, primates, reptiles, and rodents. The pattern indicates repeated vicariant speciation events among these groups. It is thought that rivers may play a role as the geographic barriers to &quot;Charis&quot;, not unlike the river barrier hypothesis used to explain the high rates of diversity in the Amazon basin—though this hypothesis has been disputed. Dispersal-mediated allopatric speciation is also thought to be a significant driver of diversification throughout the Neotropics.
Patterns of increased endemism at higher elevations on both islands and continents have been documented on a global level. As topographical elevation increases, species become isolated from one another; often constricted to graded zones. This isolation on &quot;mountain top islands&quot; creates barriers to gene flow, encouraging allopatric speciation, and generating the formation of endemic species. Mountain building (orogeny) is directly correlated with—and directly affects biodiversity. The formation of the Himalayan mountains and the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau for example have driven the speciation and diversification of numerous plants and animals such as &quot;Lepisorus&quot; ferns; glyptosternoid fishes (Sisoridae); and the &quot;Rana chensinensis&quot; species complex. Uplift has also driven vicariant speciation in &quot;Macowania&quot; daisies in South Africa&#x27;s Drakensberg mountains, along with &quot;Dendrocincla&quot; woodcreepers in the South American Andes. The Laramide orogeny during the Late Cretaceous even caused vicariant speciation and radiations of dinosaurs in North America.

Adaptive radiation, like the Galapagos finches observed by Charles Darwin, is often a consequence of rapid allopatric speciation among populations. However, in the case of the finches of the Galapagos, among other island radiations such as the honeycreepers of Hawaii represent cases of limited geographic separation and were likely driven by ecological speciation.

=== Isthmus of Panama ===
Geological evidence supports the final closure of the isthmus of Panama approximately 2.7 to 3.5 mya, with some evidence suggesting an earlier transient bridge existing between 13 and 15 mya. Recent evidence increasingly points towards an older and more complex emergence of the Isthmus, with fossil and extant species dispersal (part of the American biotic interchange) occurring in three major pulses, to and from North and South America. Further, the changes in terrestrial biotic distributions of both continents such as with &quot;Eciton&quot; army ants supports an earlier bridge or a series of bridges. Regardless of the exact timing of the isthmus closer, biologists can study the species on the Pacific and Caribbean sides in what has been called, &quot;one of the greatest natural experiments in evolution&quot;. Additionally, as with most geologic events, the closure was unlikely to have occurred rapidly, but instead dynamically—a gradual shallowing of sea water over millions of years.

Studies of snapping shrimp in the genus &quot;Alpheus&quot; have provided direct evidence of an allopatric speciation event, as phylogenetic reconstructions support the relationships of 15 pairs of sister species of &quot;Alpheus&quot;, each pair divided across the isthmus and molecular clock dating supports their separation between 3 and 15 million years ago. Recently diverged species live in shallow mangrove waters while older diverged species live in deeper water, correlating with a gradual closure of the isthmus. Support for an allopatric divergence also comes from laboratory experiments on the species pairs showing nearly complete reproductive isolation.

Similar patterns of relatedness and distribution across the Pacific and Atlantic sides have been found in other species pairs such as:
*&quot;Diadema antillarum&quot; and &quot;Diadema mexicanum&quot;
*&quot;Echinometra lucunter&quot; and &quot;Echinometra vanbrunti&quot;
*&quot;Echinometra viridis&quot; and &quot;E. vanbrunti&quot;
*&quot;Bathygobius soporator&quot; and &quot;Bathygobius ramosus&quot;
*&quot;B. soporator&quot; and &quot;Bathygobius andrei&quot;
*&quot;Excirolana braziliensis&quot; and variant morphs

=== Refugia ===
Ice ages have played important roles in facilitating speciation among vertebrate species. This concept of refugia has been applied to numerous groups of species and their biogeographic distributions.

Glaciation and subsequent retreat caused speciation in many boreal forest birds, such as with North American sapsuckers (Yellow-bellied, Red-naped, and Red-breasted); the warblers in the genus &quot;Setophaga&quot; (&quot;S. townsendii&quot;, &quot;S. occidentalis&quot;, and &quot;S. virens&quot;), &quot;Oreothlypis&quot; (&quot;O. virginiae&quot;, &quot;O. ridgwayi&quot;, and &quot;O. ruficapilla&quot;), and &quot;Oporornis&quot; (&quot;O. tolmiei&quot; and &quot;O. philadelphia&quot; now classified in the genus &quot;Geothlypis&quot;); &quot;Fox sparrows&quot; (sub species &quot;P. (i.) unalaschensis&quot;, &quot;P. (i.) megarhyncha&quot;, and &quot;P. (i.) schistacea&quot;); &quot;Vireo&quot; (&quot;V. plumbeus&quot;, &quot;V. cassinii&quot;, and &quot;V. solitarius&quot;); &quot;tyrant flycatchers&quot; (&quot;E. occidentalis&quot; and &quot;E. difficilis&quot;); &quot;chickadees&quot; (&quot;P. rufescens&quot; and &quot;P. hudsonicus&quot;); and &quot;thrushes&quot; (&quot;C. bicknelli&quot; and &quot;C. minimus&quot;).

As a special case of allopatric speciation, peripatric speciation is often invoked for instances of isolation in glaciation refugia as small populations become isolated due to habitat fragmentation such as with North American red (&quot;Picea rubens&quot;) and black (&quot;Picea mariana&quot;) spruce or the prairie dogs &quot;Cynomys mexicanus&quot; and &quot;C. ludovicianus&quot;.

=== Superspecies ===
Numerous species pairs or species groups show abutting distribution patterns, that is, reside in geographically distinct regions next to each other. They often share borders, many of which contain hybrid zones. Some examples of abutting species and superspecies (an informal rank referring to a complex of closely related allopatrically distributed species, also called &quot;allospecies&quot;) include:

*Western, Chihuahuan, and Eastern meadowlarks in North America reside in dry western and wet eastern geographic regions with rare occurrences of hybridization, most of which results in infertile offspring. 
*Monarch flycatchers endemic to the Solomon Islands; a complex of several species and subspecies (Bougainville, white-capped, and chestnut-bellied monarchs and their related subspecies).
*North American sapsuckers and members of the genus &quot;Setophaga&quot; (the hermit warbler, black-throated green warbler, and Townsend&#x27;s warbler). 
*Sixty-six subspecies in the genus &quot;Pachycephala&quot; residing on the Melanesian islands.
*Bonobos and chimpanzees.
*&quot;Climacteris&quot; tree creeper birds in Australia.
*Birds-of-paradise in the mountains of New Guinea (genus &quot;Astrapia&quot;).
*Red-shafted and yellow-shafted flickers; black-headed grosbeaks and rose-breasted grosbeaks; Baltimore orioles and Bullock&#x27;s orioles; and the lazuli and indigo buntings. All of these species pairs connect at zones of hybridization that correspond with major geographic barriers.
*&quot;Dugesia&quot; flatworms in Europe, Asia, and the Mediterranean regions.
*Dichromatic toucanets of the genus &quot;Selenidera&quot; may be a superspecies that arose by the refugia hypothesis in the Amazon basin.

In birds, some areas are prone to high rates of superspecies formation such as the 105 superspecies in Melanesia, comprising 66 percent of all bird species in the region. Patagonia is home to 17 superspecies of forest birds, while North America has 127 superspecies of both land and freshwater birds. Sub-Saharan Africa has 486 passerine birds grouped into 169 superspecies. Australia has numerous bird superspecies as well, with 34 percent of all bird species grouped into superspecies.

== Laboratory evidence ==

Experiments on allopatric speciation are often complex and do not simply divide a species population into two. This is due to a host of defining parameters: measuring reproductive isolation, sample sizes (the number of matings conducted in reproductive isolation tests), bottlenecks, length of experiments, number of generations allowed, or insufficient genetic diversity. Various isolation indices have been developed to measure reproductive isolation (and are often employed in laboratory speciation studies) such as here (index formula_5 and index formula_6):

formula_7

formula_8

Here, formula_9 and formula_10 represent the number of matings in heterogameticity where formula_11 and formula_12 represent homogametic matings. formula_9 and formula_11 is one population and formula_10 and formula_12 is the second population. A negative value of formula_5 denotes negative assortive mating, a positive value denotes positive assortive mating (i. e. expressing reproductive isolation), and a null value (of zero) means the populations are experiencing random mating.

The experimental evidence has solidly established the fact that reproductive isolation evolves as a by-product of selection. Reproductive isolation has been shown to arise from pleiotropy (&quot;i.e.&quot; indirect selection acting on genes that code for more than one trait)—what has been referred to as genetic hitchhiking. Limitations and controversies exist relating to whether laboratory experiments can accurately reflect the long-scale process of allopatric speciation that occurs in nature. Experiments often fall beneath 100 generations, far less than expected, as rates of speciation in nature are thought to be much larger. Furthermore, rates specifically concerning the evolution of reproductive isolation in &quot;Drosophila&quot; are significantly higher than what is practiced in laboratory settings. Using index &quot;Y&quot; presented previously, a survey of 25 allopatric speciation experiments (included in the table below) found that reproductive isolation was not as strong as typically maintained and that laboratory environments have not been well-suited for modeling allopatric speciation. Nevertheless, numerous experiments have shown pre-zygotic and post-zygotic isolation in vicariance, some in less than 100 generations.

Below is a non-exhaustive table of the laboratory experiments conducted on allopatric speciation. The first column indicates the species used in the referenced study, where the &quot;Trait&quot; column refers to the specific characteristic selected for or against in that species. The &quot;Generations&quot; column refers to the number of generations in each experiment performed. If more than one experiment was formed generations are separated by semicolons or dashes (given as a range). Some studies provide a duration in which the experiment was conducted. The &quot;Selection type&quot; column indicates if the study modeled vicariant or peripatric speciation (this may not be explicitly). Direct selection refers to selection imposed to promote reproductive isolation whereas indirect selection implies isolation occurring as a pleiotropic byproduct of natural selection; whereas divergent selection implies deliberate selection of each allopatric population in opposite directions (&quot;e.g.&quot; one line with more bristles and the other line with less). Some studies performed experiments modeling or controlling for genetic drift. Reproductive isolation occurred pre-zygotically, post-zygotically, both, or not at all. It is important to note that many of the studies conducted contain multiple experiments within—a resolution of which this table does not reflect.


== History and research techniques ==

Early speciation research typically reflected geographic distributions and were thus termed geographic, semi-geographic, and non-geographic. Geographic speciation corresponds to today&#x27;s usage of the term allopatric speciation, and in 1868, Moritz Wagner was the first to propose the concept of which he used the term &quot;Separationstheorie&quot;. His idea was later interpreted by Ernst Mayr as a form of founder effect speciation as it focused primarily on small geographically isolated populations.

Edward Bagnall Poulton, an evolutionary biologist and a strong proponent of the importance of natural selection, highlighted the role of geographic isolation in promoting speciation, in the process coining the term &quot;sympatric speciation&quot; in 1903.

Controversy exists as to whether Charles Darwin recognized a true geographical-based model of speciation in his publication of the &quot;Origin of Species&quot;. In chapter 11, &quot;Geographical Distribution&quot;, Darwin discusses geographic barriers to migration, stating for example that &quot;barriers of any kind, or obstacles to free migration, are related in a close and important manner to the differences between the productions of various regions [of the world]&quot;. F. J. Sulloway contends that Darwin&#x27;s position on speciation was &quot;misleading&quot; at the least and may have later misinformed Wagner and David Starr Jordan into believing that Darwin viewed sympatric speciation as the most important mode of speciation. Nevertheless, Darwin never fully accepted Wagner&#x27;s concept of geographical speciation.
David Starr Jordan played a significant role in promoting allopatric speciation in the early 20th century, providing a wealth of evidence from nature to support the theory. Much later, the biologist Ernst Mayr was the first to encapsulate the then contemporary literature in his 1942 publication &quot;Systematics and the Origin of Species, from the Viewpoint of a Zoologist&quot; and in his subsequent 1963 publication &quot;Animal Species and Evolution&quot;. Like Jordan&#x27;s works, they relied on direct observations of nature, documenting the occurrence of allopatric speciation, of which is widely accepted today. Prior to this research, Theodosius Dobzhansky published &quot;Genetics and the Origin of Species&quot; in 1937 where he formulated the genetic framework for how speciation could occur.

Other scientists noted the existence of allopatrically distributed pairs of species in nature such as Joel Asaph Allen (who coined the term &quot;Jordan&#x27;s Law&quot;, whereby closely related, geographically isolated species are often found divided by a physical barrier) and Robert Greenleaf Leavitt; however, it is thought that Wagner, Karl Jordan, and David Starr Jordan played a large role in the formation of allopatric speciation as an evolutionary concept; where Mayr and Dobzhansky contributed to the formation of the modern evolutionary synthesis.

The late 20th century saw the development of mathematical models of allopatric speciation, leading to the clear theoretical plausibility that geographic isolation can result in the reproductive isolation of two populations.

Since the 1940s, allopatric speciation has been accepted. Today, it is widely regarded as the most common form of speciation taking place in nature. However, this is not without controversy, as both parapatric and sympatric speciation are both considered tenable modes of speciation that occur in nature. Some researchers even consider there to be a bias in reporting of positive allopatric speciation events, and in one study reviewing 73 speciation papers published in 2009, only 30 percent that suggested allopatric speciation as the primary explanation for the patterns observed considered other modes of speciation as possible.

Contemporary research relies largely on multiple lines of evidence to determine the mode of a speciation event; that is, determining patterns of geographic distribution in conjunction with phylogenetic relatedness based on molecular techniques. This method was effectively introduced by John D. Lynch in 1986 and numerous researchers have employed it and similar methods, yielding enlightening results. Correlation of geographic distribution with phylogenetic data also spawned a sub-field of biogeography called vicariance biogeography developed by Joel Cracraft, James Brown, Mark V. Lomolino, among other biologists specializing in ecology and biogeography. Similarly, full analytical approaches have been proposed and applied to determine which speciation mode a species underwent in the past using various approaches or combinations thereof: species-level phylogenies, range overlaps, symmetry in range sizes between sister species pairs, and species movements within geographic ranges. Molecular clock dating methods are also often employed to accurately gauge divergence times that reflect the fossil or geological record (such as with the snapping shrimp separated by the closure of the Isthmus of Panama or speciation events within the genus &quot;Cyclamen&quot;). Other techniques used today have employed measures of gene flow between populations, ecological niche modelling (such as in the case of the Myrtle and Audubon&#x27;s warblers or the environmentally-mediated speciation taking place among dendrobatid frogs in Ecuador), and statistical testing of monophyletic groups. Biotechnological advances have allowed for large scale, multi-locus genome comparisons (such as with the possible allopatric speciation event that occurred between ancestral humans and chimpanzees), linking species&#x27; evolutionary history with ecology and clarifying phylogenetic patterns.

<text>A rope is a group of yarns, plies, fibres, or strands that are twisted or braided together into a larger and stronger form. Ropes have tensile strength and so can be used for dragging and lifting. Rope is thicker and stronger than similarly constructed cord, string, and twine.

== Construction ==
Rope may be constructed of any long, stringy, fibrous material (e.g., rattan, a natural material), but generally is constructed of certain natural or synthetic fibres. Synthetic fibre ropes are significantly stronger than their natural fibre counterparts, they have a higher tensile strength, they are more resistant to rotting than ropes created from natural fibres, and they can be made to float on water. But synthetic ropes also possess certain disadvantages, including slipperiness, and some can be damaged more easily by UV light.

Common natural fibres for rope are Manila hemp, hemp, linen, cotton, coir, jute, straw, and sisal. Synthetic fibres in use for rope-making include polypropylene, nylon, polyesters (e.g. PET, LCP, Vectran), polyethylene (e.g. Dyneema and Spectra), Aramids (e.g. Twaron, Technora and Kevlar) and acrylics (e.g. Dralon). Some ropes are constructed of mixtures of several fibres or use co-polymer fibres. Wire rope is made of steel or other metal alloys. Ropes have been constructed of other fibrous materials such as silk, wool, and hair, but such ropes are not generally available. Rayon is a regenerated fibre used to make decorative rope.

The twist of the strands in a twisted or braided rope serves not only to keep a rope together, but enables the rope to more evenly distribute tension among the individual strands. Without any twist in the rope, the shortest strand(s) would always be supporting a much higher proportion of the total load.

==Size measurement==
Because rope has a long history, many systems have been used to specify the size of a rope. In systems that use the inch (Imperial and US customary measurement systems), large ropes over diameter – such as those used on ships – are measured by their circumference in inches; smaller ropes have a nominal diameter based on the circumference divided by three (as a rough approximation of pi). In the metric system of measurement, the nominal diameter is given in millimetres. The current preferred international standard for rope sizes is to give the mass per unit length, in kilograms per metre. However, even sources otherwise using metric units may still give a &quot;rope number&quot; for large ropes, which is the circumference in inches.

== Use ==
Rope has been used since prehistoric times. It is of paramount importance in fields as diverse as construction, seafaring, exploration, sports, theatre, and communications. Many types of knots have been developed to fasten with rope, join ropes, and utilize rope to generate mechanical advantage. Pulleys can redirect the pulling force of a rope in another direction, multiply its lifting or pulling power, and distribute a load over multiple parts of the same rope to increase safety and decrease wear.

Winches and capstans are machines designed to pull ropes.

Knotted ropes have historically been used for measurement and mathematics. For example, Ancient Egyptian rope stretchers used knotted ropes to measure distances, Middle Age European shipbuilders and architects performed calculations using arithmetic ropes, and some pre-colonial South American cultures used quipu for numerical record-keeping.

== History ==

The use of ropes for hunting, pulling, fastening, attaching, carrying, lifting, and climbing dates back to prehistoric times. It is likely that the earliest &quot;ropes&quot; were naturally occurring lengths of plant fibre, such as vines, followed soon by the first attempts at twisting and braiding these strands together to form the first proper ropes in the modern sense of the word. The earliest evidence of suspected rope is a very small fragment of three-ply cord from a Neanderthal site dated 50,000 years ago. This item was so small, it was only discovered and described with the help of a high power microscope. It is slightly thicker than the average thumb-nail, and would not stretch from edge-to-edge across a little finger-nail. There are other ways fibres can twist in nature, without deliberate construction.

A tool dated between 35,000 and 40,000 years found in the Hohle Fels cave in south-western Germany has been identified as a means for making rope. It is a strip of mammoth ivory with four holes drilled through it. Each hole is lined with precisely cut spiral incisions. The grooves on three of the holes spiral in a clockwise direction from each side of the strip. The grooves on one hole spiral clockwise on one side, but counter-clockwise from the other side. Plant fibres have been found on it that could have come from when they fed through the holes and the tool twisted, creating a single ply yarn. Fiber-making experiments with a replica found that the perforations served as effective guides for raw fibers, making it easier to make a strong, elastic rope than simply twisting fibers by hand spiral incisions would have tended to keep the fibres in place. But the incisions cannot impart any twist to the fibres pulled through the holes. Other 15,000-year-old objects with holes with spiral incisions, made from reindeer antler, found across Europe are thought to have been used to manipulate ropes, or perhaps some other purpose. They were originally named &quot;batons&quot;, and thought possibly to have been carried as badges of rank.

Impressions of cordage found on fired clay provide evidence of string and rope-making technology in Europe dating back 28,000 years. Fossilized fragments of &quot;probably two-ply laid rope of about diameter&quot; were found in one of the caves at Lascaux, dating to approximately 15,000 BC.

The ancient Egyptians were probably the first civilization to develop special tools to make rope. Egyptian rope dates back to 4000 to 3500 BC and was generally made of water reed fibres. Other rope in antiquity was made from the fibres of date palms, flax, grass, papyrus, leather, or animal hair. The use of such ropes pulled by thousands of workers allowed the Egyptians to move the heavy stones required to build their monuments. Starting from approximately 2800 BC, rope made of hemp fibres was in use in China. Rope and the craft of rope making spread throughout Asia, India, and Europe over the next several thousand years.

From the Middle Ages until the 18th century, in Europe ropes were constructed in ropewalks, very long buildings where strands the full length of the rope were spread out and then &quot;laid up&quot; or twisted together to form the rope. The cable length was thus set by the length of the available rope walk. This is related to the unit of length termed &quot;cable length&quot;. This allowed for long ropes of up to long or longer to be made. These long ropes were necessary in shipping as short ropes would require splicing to make them long enough to use for sheets and halyards. The strongest form of splicing is the short splice, which doubles the cross-sectional area of the rope at the area of the splice, which would cause problems in running the line through pulleys. Any splices narrow enough to maintain smooth running would be less able to support the required weight. Rope intended for naval use would have a coloured yarn, known as the &quot;rogue&#x27;s yarn&quot;, included in the layup. This enabled the source to be identified and to detect pilfering.

Leonardo da Vinci drew sketches of a concept for a ropemaking machine, but it was never built. Remarkable feats of construction were accomplished using rope but without advanced technology: In 1586, Domenico Fontana erected the 327 ton obelisk on Rome&#x27;s Saint Peter&#x27;s Square with a concerted effort of 900 men, 75 horses, and countless pulleys and meters of rope. By the late 18th century several working machines had been built and patented.

Some rope is still made from natural fibres, such as coir and sisal, despite the dominance of synthetic fibres such as nylon and polypropylene, which have become increasingly popular since the 1950s.

Nylon was discovered in the late 1930s and was first introduced into fiber ropes during World War II. Indeed, the first synthetic fiber ropes were small braided parachute cords and three-strand tow ropes for gliders, made of nylon during World War II.

== Styles of rope ==

=== Laid or twisted rope ===
Laid rope, also called twisted rope, is historically the prevalent form of rope, at least in modern Western history. Common twisted rope generally consists of three strands and is normally right-laid, or given a final right-handed twist. The ISO 2 standard uses the uppercase letters and to indicate the two possible directions of twist, as suggested by the direction of slant of the central portions of these two letters. The handedness of the twist is the direction of the twists as they progress away from an observer. Thus Z-twist rope is said to be right-handed, and S-twist to be left-handed.

Twisted ropes are built up in three steps. First, fibres are gathered and spun into yarns. A number of these yarns are then formed into strands by twisting. The strands are then twisted together to lay the rope. The twist of the yarn is opposite to that of the strand, and that in turn is opposite to that of the rope. It is this counter-twist, introduced with each successive operation, which holds the final rope together as a stable, unified object.

Traditionally, a three strand laid rope is called a &quot;plain-&quot; or &quot;hawser-laid&quot;, a four strand rope is called &quot;shroud-laid&quot;, and a larger rope formed by counter-twisting three or more multi-strand ropes together is called &quot;cable-laid&quot;. Cable-laid rope is sometimes clamped to maintain a tight counter-twist rendering the resulting cable virtually waterproof. Without this feature, deep water sailing (before the advent of steel chains and other lines) was largely impossible, as any appreciable length of rope for anchoring or ship to ship transfers, would become too waterlogged – and therefore too heavy – to lift, even with the aid of a capstan or windlass.

One property of laid rope is partial untwisting when used. This can cause spinning of suspended loads, or stretching, , or of the rope itself. An additional drawback of twisted construction is that every fibre is exposed to abrasion numerous times along the length of the rope. This means that the rope can degrade to numerous inch-long fibre fragments, which is not easily detected visually.

Twisted ropes have a preferred direction for coiling. Normal right-laid rope should be coiled clockwise, to prevent kinking. Coiling this way imparts a twist to the rope. Rope of this type must be bound at its ends by some means to prevent untwisting.

=== Braided rope ===

While rope may be made from three or more strands, modern braided rope consists of a braided (tubular) jacket over strands of fibre (these may also be braided). Some forms of braided rope with untwisted cores have a particular advantage; they do not impart an additional twisting force when they are stressed. The lack of added twisting forces is an advantage when a load is freely suspended, as when a rope is used for rappelling or to suspend an arborist. Other specialized cores reduce the shock from arresting a fall when used as a part of a personal or group safety system.

Braided ropes are generally made from nylon, polyester, polypropylene or high performance fibres such as high modulus polyethylene (HMPE) and aramid. Nylon is chosen for its strength and elastic stretch properties. However, nylon absorbs water and is 10–15% weaker when wet. Polyester is about 90% as strong as nylon but stretches less under load and is not affected by water. It has somewhat better UV resistance, and is more abrasion resistant. Polypropylene is preferred for low cost and light weight (it floats on water) but it has limited resistance to ultraviolet light, is susceptible to friction and has a poor heat resistance.

Braided ropes (and objects like garden hoses, fibre optic or coaxial cables, etc.) that have no &quot;lay&quot; (or inherent twist) uncoil better if each alternate loop is twisted in the opposite direction, such as in figure-eight coils, where the twist reverses regularly and essentially cancels out.

Single braid consists of an even number of strands, eight or twelve being typical, braided into a circular pattern with half of the strands going clockwise and the other half going anticlockwise. The strands can interlock with either twill or panama (Basked) or seldom plain weave. Kyosev introduced the German notation in English, where the floating length (German: Flechtigkeit) and the number of yarns in a group (German: Fädigkeit) in more natural way for braiding process are used, instead of the pattern names in weaving. The central void may be large or small; in the former case the term &quot;hollow braid&quot; is sometimes preferred.

Double braid, also called braid on braid, consists of an inner braid filling the central void in an outer braid, that may be of the same or different material. Often the inner braid fibre is chosen for strength while the outer braid fibre is chosen for abrasion resistance.

In a solid braid, (square braid, gasket, or form braid there are at least three or more groups of yarns, interlacing in complex (interlocking) structure. This construction is popular for gaskets and general purpose utility rope but rare in specialized high performance line.
Kernmantle rope has a core (kern) of long twisted fibres in the center, with a braided outer sheath or mantle of woven fibres. The kern provides most of the strength (about 70%), while the mantle protects the kern and determines the handling properties of the rope (how easy it is to hold, to tie knots in, and so on). In dynamic climbing line, core fibres are usually twisted to make the rope more elastic. Static kernmantle ropes are made with untwisted core fibres and tighter braid, which causes them to be stiffer in addition to limiting the stretch.

=== Other types ===
Plaited rope is made by braiding twisted strands, and is also called &quot;square braid&quot;. It is not as round as twisted rope and coarser to the touch. It is less prone to kinking than twisted rope and, depending on the material, very flexible and therefore easy to handle and knot. This construction exposes all fibres as well, with the same drawbacks as described above. Brait rope is a combination of braided and plaited, a non-rotating alternative to laid three-strand ropes. Due to its excellent energy-absorption characteristics, it is often used by arborists. It is also a popular rope for anchoring and can be used as mooring warps. This type of construction was pioneered by Yale Cordage.

Endless winding rope is made by winding single strands of high-performance yarns around two end terminations until the desired break strength or stiffness has been reached. This type of rope (often specified as cable to make the difference between a braided or twined construction) has the advantage of having no construction stretch as is the case with above constructions. Endless winding is pioneered by SmartRigging and FibreMax.

=== Rock climbing ===

The sport of rock climbing uses what is termed &quot;dynamic&quot; rope, an elastic rope which stretches under load to absorb the energy generated in arresting a fall without creating forces high enough to injure the climber. Such ropes are of kernmantle construction, as described below.

Conversely, &quot;static&quot; ropes have minimal stretch and are not designed to arrest free falls. They are used in caving, rappelling, rescue applications, and industries such as window washing. 

The UIAA, in concert with the CEN, sets climbing-rope standards and oversees testing. Any rope bearing a GUIANA or CE certification tag is suitable for climbing. Climbing ropes cut easily when under load. Keeping them away from sharp rock edges is imperative. Previous falls arrested by a rope, damage to its sheath, and contamination by dirt or solvents all weaken a rope and can render it unsuitable for further sport use.

Rock climbing ropes are designated as suitable for single, double or twin use. A single rope is the most common, and is intended to be used by itself. These range in thickness from roughly . Smaller diameter ropes are lighter, but wear out faster. 

Double ropes are thinner than single, usually and under, and are intended for use in pairs. These offer a greater margin of safety against cutting, since it is unlikely that both ropes will be cut, but complicate both belaying and leading. Double ropes may be clipped into alternating pieces of protection, allowing each to stay straighter and reduce both individual and total rope drag.

Twin ropes are thin ropes which must be clipped into the same piece of protection, in effect being treated as a single strand. This adds security in situations where a rope may get cut. However new lighter-weight ropes with greater safety have virtually replaced this type of rope.

The butterfly and alpine coils are methods of coiling a rope for carrying.

== Handling ==

Rope made from hemp, cotton or nylon is generally stored in a cool dry place for proper storage. To prevent kinking it is usually coiled. To prevent fraying or unravelling, the ends of a rope are bound with twine (whipping), tape, or heat shrink tubing. The ends of plastic fibre ropes are often melted and fused solid; however, the rope and knotting expert Geoffrey Budworth warns against this practice thus:
&quot;Sealing rope ends this way is lazy and dangerous.&quot; A tugboat operator once sliced the palm of his hand open down to the sinews after the hardened (and obviously &quot;sharp&quot;) end of a rope that had been heat-sealed pulled through his grasp. There is no substitute for a properly made whipping.
If a load-bearing rope gets a sharp or sudden jolt or the rope shows signs of deteriorating, it is recommended that the rope be replaced immediately and should be discarded or only used for non-load-bearing tasks.

The average rope life-span is 5 years. Serious inspection should be given to line after that point. However, the use to which a rope is put affects frequency of inspection. Rope used in mission-critical applications, such as mooring lines or running rigging, should be regularly inspected on a much shorter timescale than this, and rope used in life-critical applications such as mountain climbing should be inspected on a far more frequent basis, up to and including before each use.

Avoid stepping on climbing rope, as this might force tiny pieces of rock through the sheath, which can eventually deteriorate the core of the rope.

Ropes may be flemished into coils on deck for safety, presentation, and tidiness.

Many types of filaments in ropes are weakened by corrosive liquids, solvents, and high temperatures. Such damage is particularly treacherous because it is often invisible to the eye.

Shock loading should be avoided with general use ropes, as it can damage them. All ropes should be used within a safe working load, which is much less than their breaking strength.

A rope under tension – particularly if it has a great deal of elasticity – can be dangerous if parted. Care should be taken around lines under load.

== Terminology ==
&quot;Rope&quot; is a material, and a tool. When it is assigned a specific function it is often referred to as a &quot;line&quot;, especially in nautical usage. A line may get a further distinction, for example sail control lines are known as &quot;sheets&quot; (e.g. A jib sheet).

A halyard is a line used to raise and lower a sail, typically with a shackle on its sail end. Other maritime examples of &quot;lines&quot; include anchor line, mooring line, fishing line, . Common items include clothesline and a chalk line.

In some marine uses the term rope is retained, such as man rope, bolt rope, and bell rope.

<doc id="334993" wikidata="Q336306" url="?curid=334993" title="National Anthem of Uruguay">
<text>The &quot;&quot; (), also known by its incipit &quot;Orientales, la Patria o la Tumba&quot; (), is the longest national anthem in terms of duration with 105 bars of music. When performed in its entirety, the anthem lasts about four-and-a-half to six minutes, although nowadays only the first verse and chorus are sung on most occasions, such as before sporting events.

Its martial lyrics were written by the Uruguayan poet Francisco Acuña de Figueroa in 1830, who also wrote the lyrics for Paraguay&#x27;s national anthem, &quot;Paraguayos, República o Muerte&quot;. The lyrics were officially declared the national anthem in July 1833. Several proposed musical settings failed to gain public support. The Rossini-inspired music that eventually became universally associated with the anthem was composed by the Hungarian-born composer Francisco José Debali, with the assistance of Fernando Quijano, a Uruguayan actor and musician. A few days after the first performance in July 1845, Debali&#x27;s score was officially recognized as the music for the anthem. As with other South American national anthems, the music was inspired by the local popularity of Italian opera. It includes several references to &quot;La Cenerentola&quot; and other operas by Rossini, as well as a direct musical quotation from &quot;Lucrezia Borgia&quot; by Gaetano Donizetti.

The French composer Camille Saint-Saëns is sometimes erroneously credited with having composed the music: although he was requested to write a hymn to celebrate the national independence day, his composition never became the national anthem.

==History==

The Uruguayan poet Francisco Acuña de Figueroa, who also wrote the lyrics for Paraguay&#x27;s national anthem &quot;Paraguayos, República o Muerte&quot;, was responsible for the martial lyrics. On 8 July 1833, &quot;Orientales, la Patria o la Tumba&quot; was officially recognized as Uruguay&#x27;s national anthem.

Several proposed musical settings of Figueroa&#x27;s lyrics failed to gain public support. One of the discarded settings was by the Spanish-born composer Antonio Sáenz. A proposed melody by the Italian composer Francesco Casale became the basis for the music of the Paraguay national anthem.

The Rossini-inspired music that eventually became universally associated with the anthem was composed by the Hungarian-born composer Francisco José Debali, with the assistance of Fernando Quijano, a Uruguayan actor and musician. The score was first performed on 19 July 1845, and it was officially recognized as the music for the anthem on 25 July 1848.

==Music==

As with every other South American national anthem, the music was inspired by the local popularity of Italian opera.
The full 105-bar version of the anthem evokes an operatic &quot;scena e aria&quot; for soloist and chorus (almost in &quot;solita forma&quot; manner, with a &quot;cabaletta&quot;-like conclusion). Debali had conducted in many productions of operas by Gioachino Rossini and Gaetano Donizetti in Montevideo, and during the course of the anthem he makes several musical references to Rossini&#x27;s &quot;La Cenerentola&quot;, as well as to &quot;Largo al factotum&quot; from &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;, and to a chorus from &quot;Semiramide&quot;. A further passage is clearly borrowed from the ending of the Prologue of Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Lucrezia Borgia&quot;.

Of note, the music for the Uruguayan national anthem is sometimes erroneously attributed to Camille Saint-Saëns. It is true that during a visit to Uruguay in April 1916 Saint-Saëns was commissioned to write a hymn to celebrate the national independence day. However, circumstances prevented the work, &quot;Partido colorado&quot;, from becoming the national anthem.

<doc id="334994" wikidata="Q5165251" url="?curid=334994" title="Continental Baptist Churches">
<text>Continental Baptist Churches was an association of &quot;Calvinistic&quot; Baptist churches holding New Covenant theology, organized in June 1983. The roots of this movement are in the &quot;Baptist Reformation Review&quot;, founded by Norbert Ward at Nashville, Tennessee, in 1972, and the &quot;Sword and the Trowel&quot;, edited by Ron McKinney of Dallas, Texas. Both of these papers espoused the doctrines traditionally known as Calvinism.

In 1979, the &quot;Sword and Trowel&quot; leaders began to sponsor an annual &quot;Council on Baptist Theology.&quot; Through this form of exchange, it became clear that this &quot;Dallas&quot; group held different understandings, especially in the area of Covenant Theology, from those espoused by northeastern Reformed Baptists led by Walter Chantry and Albert N. Martin. This led the &quot;Dallas&quot; (&quot;Sword and Trowel&quot;) churches to form their own association – Continental Baptist Churches. This group began with about twenty churches.

Beliefs held by the churches of this body include the doctrines of grace, often referred to as the Five Points of Calvinism, the gathered believers church, believers&#x27; baptism by immersion requisite to church membership and to participation at the Lord&#x27;s table, and the autonomy of each local church. Continental Baptist Churches accept the First London Confession of Faith (1646 edition) as a general expression of their beliefs.

Continental Baptist churches generally disagreed with other Baptists in the Reformed tradition concerning the function of the moral law and the Ten Commandments in the Christian age, maintaining, for instance, the seventh-day Sabbath position that Christians have no obligation to observe the first day of the week as Christian Sabbath because of the fourth commandment.

The organizational structure includes an executive committee composed of a Council elected by the churches and the officers (Chairman, Vice Chairman, Secretary and Treasurer) elected by the association. A periodical called &quot;Kindred Minds&quot; is the official publication of Continental Baptist Churches. The association holds a Bible Conference and business meeting each year. In 1995, nine churches were participating in the association. Membership is open to any Baptist church &quot;on the North American continent which subscribes to the Constitution and Articles of Faith of the Association.&quot; These churches must be received by majority vote of the messengers at the annual meeting. Continental Baptist Churches also cooperates with the Sovereign Grace Baptist Association of Churches.

Beginning with twenty churches in 1983, by 1994 this body was down to six churches in Indiana, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia. According to Albert Wardin, &quot;ceased as an association in 2003.&quot;

<text>The American Philatelic Society (APS) is the largest nonprofit stamp collecting foundation of philately in the world. Both the membership and interests of the society are worldwide.

==History==
The organization, originally named the &quot;American Philatelic Association&quot;, was established on September 14, 1886 in New York City, and the following day elected John Kerr Tiffany as its first president. Voting membership was granted to 219 individuals who paid two bits (25¢) for the privilege. The organization&#x27;s name was changed to its present name for a few months in 1897, then back, then permanently in 1908.

Society membership reached over 4,000 in 1940 and included U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes. At the 1942 APS convention, board member Donald Lybarger argued for the creation of a central office near the geographic center of the philatelic community, but not in a large city. When he was elected APS President in 1943, he was able to turn his vision into reality. At the 1944 APS convention it was announced that the APS would accept applications for the position of Executive Secretary. H. Clay Musser of State College, Pennsylvania, was selected and the APS office was established there on April 1, 1945. As a testament to their leadership, the APS became the US representative to the Federation Internationale de Philatelie in 1947.
By the mid-1990s, the expanded services, staff and the American Philatelic Research Library had outgrown the facility in State College. A study determined that because of high local real estate values, it was not cost effective to expand the existing building. A search of alternatives identified a property ten miles (sixteen kilometers) from State College that was basically sound and could be acquired for a reasonable amount. In 2002, after much discussion, debate and soul searching, the APS committed millions of dollars to purchasing and renovating what was known as the Match Factory in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania. The American Philatelic Center was dedicated in June 2004.

==Philatelic services==
The APS offers numerous services to its members:
* &quot;The American Philatelist&quot; - monthly magazine
* &quot;StampStore&quot; - online stamp buying and selling
* Member sales circuits - for most collecting specialties via mail
* American Philatelic Research Library
* Stamp insurance - for stamp collectors
* &quot;American Philatelic Expertizing Service&quot; - stamp authentication
* Judging Accreditation for stamp competition 
* Stamp education opportunities
* Dispute resolution - between members
* APS Stamp Talk with Nancy Clark on internet radio talk station wsRadio.
* American Philatelic Society Hall of Fame

==Members==
APS membership includes over 600 commercial stamp dealers and about 450 local stamp clubs. In addition, nearly 200 specialty societies are affiliated with the APS. There are APS members from 110 countries of the world.
Individual membership reached a high of 57,815 in 1988 and stood at 24,421 as of April 30, 2023.

==Events==
The organization has two national events each year: &quot;APS AmeriStamp Expo&quot; is held each Winter and &quot;Great American Stamp Show&quot; is scheduled in the Summer. Both shows rotate to different locations around the country. The Summer event is the largest annual national show with 150 dealers, 10,000 pages of exhibits, meetings of more than 25 national societies, and over 100 educational seminars. Local stamp clubs host smaller shows, some several times each year.

According to the ARIPEX website, its 61st annual show to be held 15–17 February 2019 in Mesa, AZ, will be &quot;the last winter show conducted by the APS.&quot;

==Honors and awards==
The society honors those who serve honorably and notably in the field of philately. The American Philatelic Society Hall of Fame honors those now-deceased philatelists who have served philately. In addition, the society honors living distinguished philatelists for their contributions to the field with the Luff Award.

==Controversy==
Around 1970, numerous newly independent countries realized that issuing stamps was an excellent source of revenue. Because the stamps were sent to other countries, there was little risk of the stamps actually being used for postage. Historically, a country issued stamps to commemorate an event or honor a national figure, but these new nations created stamps that appealed to popular collecting themes, such as Disney figures, airplanes or space, famous people in the world. Instead of releasing a single stamp, they would create a set, with values ranging from a penny to five dollars. The APS was appalled and created the “black blot” program. The society published a monthly magazine for members and began to include a list of new stamp issues that were judged to be overpriced or unnecessary. A country with high illiteracy and a marginal postal service did not require 100 different stamps each year. However, many collectors rebelled at being told to reject some stamps, and the program was eventually dropped.

==Post office==
The original board and batten post office from Headsville, West Virginia, in service from 1860 to 1914, was purchased by the Smithsonian Institution in 1971, disassembled and moved to Washington, D.C., reassembled and opened as an example of a country store-post office for the Smithsonian&#x27;s 125th anniversary in 1971. It operated as a contract post office there until 2006 when the National Museum of American History closed for renovations. The historic building was again disassembled and moved to Bellefonte on loan to the APS. It was reassembled and again operates as a contract post office.

<text>The HP 49/50 series are Hewlett-Packard (HP) manufactured graphing calculators. They are the successors of the HP 48 series.

There are five calculators in the 49/50 series of HP graphing calculators. These calculators have both algebraic and RPN entry modes, and can perform numeric and symbolic calculations using the built-in Computer Algebra System (CAS), which is an improved ALG48 and Erable combination from the HP 48 series.

Along with the HP 15C and the HP 48, it is widely considered the greatest calculator ever designed for engineers, scientists, and surveyors. It has advanced functions suitable for applications in mathematics, linear algebra, physics, statistical analysis, numerical analysis, computer science, and others.
Although out of production, its popularity has led to high prices on the used market.
==HP 49G==

The HP 49G (F1633A, F1896A), was released in August 1999.

The 49G incorporated many of the most powerful interface and mathematics tools available on the HP 48 series into the firmware of the new 49G, including the ability to easily decompile and compile both SysRPL and Saturn assembly code on the unit.

The 49G was the first HP calculator to use flash memory and have an upgradable firmware. In addition, it had a hard sliding case as opposed to the soft pouches supplied with the HP 48 series. Almost the same hardware is also used by the HP 39G and HP 40G.

The last officially supported firmware update for the 49G calculator was 1.18, but several unofficial firmware versions were released by the developers. The final firmware version was 1.19-6. Several firmware versions for the successor hp 49g+ and HP 50g calculators have also been released in builds intended for PC emulation software that lacked full utilization of the successors&#x27; ARM CPU. Until at least firmware version 2.09, those emulator builds could be installed on the original HP 49G as well.

In 2003, the CAS source code of the 49G firmware was released under the LGPL. In addition, this release included an interactive geometry program and some commands to allow compatibility with certain programs written for the newer 49g+ calculator. Due to licensing restrictions, the recompiled firmware cannot be redistributed.

==hp 49g+==
In August 2003, Hewlett-Packard released the hp 49g+ (F2228A). This unit had metallic gold coloration and was backward compatible with the HP 49G.It was designed and manufactured by Kinpo Electronics for HP.

This calculator featured an entirely new processor architecture, USB (Mini-B) and IrDA (IrCOMM) infrared communication, memory expansion via an SD (SDSC/MMC) card, and a slightly larger screen, as well as other improvements over the previous model.

The calculator system did not run directly on the new ARM processor, but rather on an emulation layer for the older Saturn processors found in previous HP calculators. In principle, the firmware for the calculator is identical to that for the 49G, but it gets automatically patched in the course of development to replace some code sequences by special virtual &quot;Saturn+&quot; instructions which bypass the emulation and run natively on the underlying ARM processor in order to improve the calculator&#x27;s speed. This allowed the 49g+ to maintain binary-level compatibility with most of the programs written for the HP 49G calculator, as well as source code-level compatibility with many written for the HP 48 series.

Despite the emulation, the 49g+ was still much faster than any older model of HP calculator. The speed increase over the HP 49G is around 3–7 times depending on the task. It is even possible to run programs written for the ARM processor thus bypassing the emulation layer completely. A port of the GNU C compiler is also available (see HPGCC below).

==hp 48gII==

The hp 48gII (F2226A), which was announced on 20 October 2003, was not a replacement for the HP 48 series as its name suggested. Rather it was a 49g+, also with an ARM processor (unlike the HP 48G), but with reduced memory, no expansion via an SD memory card, lower clock speed, a smaller screen, and a non-flashable firmware. This calculator seems to target users that desire mathematical capability, but have no desire to install many programs. The original 2003 version had 128 KB RAM and ran on 3 AAA batteries, whereas the second 2007 version (based on the Apple V2 platform) needs four AAA batteries and comes with 256 KB RAM, added a USB (Mini-B) port and features a better keyboard.

==HP 50g==
The HP 50g (F2229A) is the latest calculator in the 49/50 series, introduced in 2006. The most apparent change is a revised color scheme, returning the unit to a more traditional HP calculator appearance. Using black plastic for the entire body, white, orange and yellow are used for function shift keys. The back shell is textured more deeply than the 49g+ to provide a more secure grip.

In 2009/2010, a blue and white color scheme variant (NW240AA) specifically tailored for high-contrast was introduced as well. It was also designed to aid color-blind users. In 2011/2012, a slightly different blue and white color scheme was introduced.

The form and size of the calculator shell is identical to the 49g+ series, but four AAA batteries are used as opposed to three in previous models. In addition to all the features of the 49g+, the 50g also includes the full equation library found in the HP 48G series (also available for the 49g+ with firmware 2.06 and above), as well as the periodic table library originally available as a plug-in card for the 48S series, as of firmware 2.15/ 2.16 (the latest, as of 2015), and has a 3.3 V TTL-level asynchronous serial port in addition to IrDA and USB Mini-B ports of the 49g+. Like the 49g+, the range of the infrared port has been limited to about 10 cm (4 inches). Like for the 49g+, the firmware is in principle identical to that for the 49G, but gets automatically patched in the course of development.

The asynchronous serial port is not a true RS-232 port as it uses different voltage levels and a non-standard connector. An external converter/adapter is required to interface with RS-232 equipment.

The keyboard, the most often criticized feature of the 49g+ calculators, uses the new design introduced on the very last 49g+ calculators (hinged keys) to eliminate previous problems.

A worldwide announcement regarding the availability of this calculator was made by HP in September 2006, and official details were available on the HP calculators webpage. The calculator was officially discontinued in 2015. It was HP&#x27;s last calculator to support RPL, later calculators like the HP Prime support RPN only, although in a variant named Advanced RPN.

==Programming==
The HP 49/50 series of calculators support both algebraic and a stack-based programming language named RPL, a combination of Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) and Lisp. RPL adds the concepts of lists and functions to stack-based programming, allowing the programmer to pass unevaluated code as arguments to functions, or return unevaluated code from a function by leaving it on the stack.

The highest level language is User RPL, consisting of sequences of built-in postfix operations, optionally including loops and conditionals. Every User RPL command checks the stack for its particular arguments and returns an error if they are incorrect or not present.

Below User RPL is System RPL (SysRPL). Most System RPL commands lack argument checking and are defined only for specific argument types (e.g. short integer vs. long integer), making System RPL programs run dramatically faster than equivalent User RPL ones. In addition, System RPL includes many advanced functions that are not available in User RPL. System RPL programs can be created without the use of PC software (although it is available), thanks to the calculator&#x27;s built-in compiler, MASD. MASD also can compile Saturn assembly language and, with the latest firmware revision for the 49g+/50g, ARMv4T assembly language on the calculator itself. Many tools exist to assist programmers and make the calculator a powerful programming environment.

Saturn assembly, and, on the 49g+/50g, ARM assembly and C, are also programmable using desktop based compilers. See also the programs available for the HP 48 series.

No model of this series is programmable in HP PPL.

==HPGCC for the 49g+/50g==
HPGCC is an implementation of the GCC compiler, released under the GNU GPL. It is now mainly targeted at the ARM-based 49g+/50g calculators. Previous versions of HPGCC supported the other ARM-based calculator models (the 48gII, and the hp 39g+/HP 39gs/HP 40gs), but this was removed due to lack of interest and compatibility issues. Formally, HPGCC is a cross-compiler; it compiles code for the ARM-based HP calculators, but runs on a PC rather than the target system.

The latest version of HPGCC offers many enhancements from earlier versions. Most notably, the compiled code is now in ARM Thumb mode by default, resulting in great reduction in code size with little performance hit. Besides implementing most of ANSI C, there are device-specific libraries that allow access to things like the calculator&#x27;s RPN stack, memory and piezoelectric buzzer. The GCC compiler itself is the property of the Free Software Foundation, and they state that its use does not impose any particular licensing restrictions on any of its output. However, the libraries included with HPGCC, including routines necessary to actually invoke any HPGCC-compiled program on an actual calculator, are released under a modified GPL license, contrary to GCC on many other platforms which use a more permissive license for their libraries. Thus any programs that link against them can only be distributed if they are also released under the GPL (with an exception for &quot;non-profit&quot; software).

Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X versions are available for download. The Windows version also includes a version of Programmer&#x27;s Notepad for a basic IDE.

==Emulators==
There are several emulators available for the HP 49G calculator. A version of EMU48 is available in the Debug4x IDE that allows emulation of most of the features of the 49g+/50g, but will not execute any ARM-based code.

An ARM-based emulator, x49gp, has been released and allows the true emulation of the 49g+/50g ARM processor and successfully runs HPGCC 2 and 3 compiled programs. The emulator is only available for Linux and Mac OS X and must be compiled from the source. (See README.QUICKSTART for details.)

The commercial version of the application m48 also supports HP 49G. So far, there are no 49g+/50g emulators for smartphones with the exception of HP 50g for iPhone and iPad released in October 2012.

An emulator for Microsoft Windows Mobile (PPC, smartphones) is available.

Other 49G/49g+/50g emulators for Android (without ARM support).

In 2012, Hewlett-Packard released an emulator named &quot;HP 50g Virtual Calculator&quot; (version 3.1.29/3.1.30 with firmware 2.16 and support for the StreamSmart 410) for Windows.

==Firmware updates==
The 49/50 series allows the user to update the firmware to gain enhanced features or bug fixes. Official firmware updates are released by Hewlett-Packard. Unsupported unofficial firmware updates are also available at sites such as hpcalc.org.

<text>Tom Reamy (January 23, 1935 – November 4, 1977) was an American science fiction and fantasy author and a key figure in 1960s and 1970s science fiction fandom. He died at age 42 prior to the publication of his first novel; his work is primarily dark fantasy.

== Fan, editor, convention organizer ==
Thomas Earl Reamy was born in Woodson, Texas during the Great Depression. While still in his teens in the early 1950s, Reamy became active in science fiction fandom&#x27;s fanzine and convention culture, as both a fan writer and fan artist. During this period, Reamy began to experiment with writing fantasy and science fiction stories. He was never quite satisfied with or confident enough to submit his stories to the editors of the professional genre magazines of the era, despite encouragement from friends and others who felt he had talent; Reamy continued to hone his writing for many years, while exploring other expressions for his growing creativity.

Reamy, along with transplanted Texan Orville W. Mosher, founded the first organized science fiction fan club in Texas: The Dallas Futurian Society (DFS), so named after the earlier New York Futurians. The DFS was founded in late fall of 1953 when Reamy was 18, and the club was continually active until July 6, 1958, when it expired in a colorful fashion. During that five-year period, Mosher and Reamy traded off editing the club&#x27;s fanzine &quot;CriFanAc&quot; (a fandom term for Critical Fan Activity), attracting a variety of contributors, both local and from greater science fiction fandom; Reamy became its sole editor with its sixth issue. He had been contributing both artwork and commentary to its pages, as he was also doing to other science fiction fanzines of the era.

With fellow Dallas Futurians James and Gregory Benford, Reamy organized the first science fiction convention held in Texas. A rotating city and state regional convention of the era, Southwesterncon&#x27;s sixth incarnation was held in Dallas on the weekend of July 5, 1958, concluding the next day, July 6; the professional guest of honor was new writer and well-known fan Marion Zimmer Bradley, who by then had replaced Fredric Brown. Longtime science fiction fan personality, collector, and literary agent Forrest J Ackerman came from Los Angeles and served at the convention&#x27;s banquet as toastmaster. On the last day of the convention, the members of the Dallas Futurian Society disbanded their club as part of Southwestercon VI&#x27;s business meeting. During that meeting, Reamy proposed a motion that club co-founder Orville W. Mosher, the man behind much of the club&#x27;s behind-the-scenes intrigue and politics during its final years, be elected by consensus their new president. Just moments later, the same Dallas Futurian Society voted on another Reamy motion, to officially disband itself forever; the motion passed, despite objections from Mosher. He was never heard from again. 

During the mid-to-late 1960s, while working as a technical illustrator for aerospace contractor Collins Radio at their Dallas branch, Reamy became the editor and publisher of &quot;Trumpet&quot;, a slickly produced, professionally printed fanzine (the norm for the era was to use the much less expensive ditto or mimeograph reproduction for fanzines). Between 1965 and 1969, 10 issues appeared, the later issues having full-color front covers. In 1966, &quot;Trumpet&quot; received enough nominations for inclusion on that year&#x27;s final Hugo Awards ballot; it was later ruled as being ineligible because it failed to meet the Hugo&#x27;s minimum number of published issues requirement needed for nomination. In 1967 and then again in 1969, &quot;Trumpet&quot; made it on the final ballot in the Best Fanzine category for science fiction&#x27;s Hugo Award.

In the late 1960s, Reamy also organized and became chairman of Dallas fandom&#x27;s long-running &quot;Big D in &#x27;73&quot; bid to host the 31st World Science Fiction Convention. He also edited and designed the bid&#x27;s official publication, &quot;The Dallascon Bulletin&quot;, which, like &quot;Trumpet&quot;, used photo-offset printing. Nothing like them had been produced by previous Worldcon bidders. Each issue&#x27;s appearance polarized strong support for or against the Texas bid, due to its widespread, free circulation to 6000+, and the large amount of paid advertising each issue carried. As a result, the Texans were sometimes accused of trying to buy a win for the Dallas bid. Ultimately, the long-running Dallascon bid collapsed for complex reasons unrelated to this controversy, several months before 1973&#x27;s site-selection vote was taken at Noreascon, the 1971 Worldcon in Boston. As a result, the Toronto bid won the 31st Worldcon, becoming Torcon II.

Early in the 1970s, Reamy became one of the founders of the Dallas area&#x27;s Turkey City Writer&#x27;s Workshop. Many new Texas genre writers emerged from this workshop, eventually giving birth in 1976 to the all-Texas original speculative fiction hardcover anthology, &quot;Lone Star Universe&quot;; the workshop continues to this day.

Reamy&#x27;s high-profile Worldcon bid in science fiction fandom and its &quot;Dallascon Bulletin&quot; had a lasting impact: These and Reamy&#x27;s ten issues of &quot;Trumpet&quot; inspired the formation on July 3, 1971, of the still-ongoing Kansas City Science Fiction and Fantasy Society (KaCSFFS) and several year&#x27;s later, Kansas City&#x27;s bid for the 1976 Worldcon. Many of Dallas&#x27; &quot;Big Bid&quot; concepts were adopted by KC and used in its multi-level bidding strategy. Reamy joined the KC bid at chairman Ken Keller&#x27;s request, shortly before their victory in 1974, filling two key department head positions on the convention committee. The ill-fated &quot;Big D in &#x27;73&quot; bid was reborn in Kansas City as &quot;KC in &#x27;76.&quot; Kansas City went on to win their Worldcon bid at Discon 2, held during Labor Day weekend 1974.

Following his move to KC in the late summer of 1974, Reamy retired &quot;Trumpet&quot; and began publishing the similar &quot;Nickelodeon&quot;. There, with new business partner Ken Keller, he started a typesetting and graphic design business, Nickelodeon Graphics Arts Service. Together, they created the publications division for KC&#x27;s now official MidAmeriCon, the 34th World Science Fiction Convention. Reamy immediately established a strong editorial style and modern graphic design approach to the convention&#x27;s progress reports and other publications. That included a first: a full-sized, hardcover program book, a concept left over from the old Dallascon bid. All of this had a permanent influence on all Worldcon publications that followed. Reamy was also the department head of the convention&#x27;s ambitious film program department that developed another first: a comprehensive, 80-hour, &quot;all 35mm&quot; science fiction film retrospective within a World Science Fiction Convention. The concept included a movie theater-style concessions area that offered freshly popped popcorn, selections of soda, and candies.

==Published writer==

In the early 1970s, having honed his writing craft quietly for many years, Reamy felt confident enough to begin submitting his fiction to the genre&#x27;s magazines and original short story anthologies; his work began selling almost immediately, the first two stories being bought on the very same day. Thirteen stories of various lengths and one novel were completed before his untimely death.

Reamy&#x27;s only novel &quot;Blind Voices&quot;, published posthumously in both hardcover and mass-market paperback editions, earned critical comparisons with the works of Richard Matheson, Ray Bradbury, and Harlan Ellison. The novel deals with the arrival of a strange and wonderful “freak show” at a rural town in Kansas during the 1920s and its effects on the lives of the residents. While not quite as polished as those authors’ works (there was some question as to whether Reamy intended another polish draft of the novel), critics regarded &quot;Blind Voices&quot; as an exceptional first novel, causing both fans and critics to ponder how important a figure he could have become if he had lived.

Other than &quot;Blind Voices&quot;, the only other Tom Reamy book is a collection of his shorter fiction, &quot;San Diego Lightfoot Sue and Other Stories&quot;, also published in both hardcover and mass-market paperback. The volume has an insightful and passionate introduction, &quot;Embrace the Departing Shadow,&quot; by Harlan Ellison, surveying Reamy&#x27;s stories and his short career before his untimely death). The story &quot;San Diego Lightfoot Sue&quot; won the 1975 Nebula Award for Best Novelette, and was a finalist for the 1976 Hugo Award for Best Novelette.

==Death==

Tom Reamy died on November 4, 1977 at age 42 while at his home in Independence, Missouri. He was found dead from a heart attack, slumped over his typewriter seven pages into a new, untitled story for editor Edward L. Ferman at &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;. He was laid to rest in Woodson Cemetery in Woodson, Texas, where other members of the Reamy family were interred. Prior to his death, Reamy and artist George Barr had begun working again on their graphic novel adaptation of Poul Anderson&#x27;s fantasy novel &quot;The Broken Sword&quot;, which had begun appearing a decade before in the pages of Reamy&#x27;s &quot;Trumpet&quot;; the project languished after his untimely death.

<text>Peta Gia Wilson (born 18 November 1970) is an Australian actress, lingerie designer, and model. She is best-known as Nikita in the television series &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Wilson was born in Sydney on 18 November 1970. She is the daughter of the caterer Karlene White Wilson and Darcy Wilson, a former Warrant Officer in the Australian Army. She spent several years in Papua New Guinea when her father was stationed there. Her parents divorced in 1982.

===Career===
Wilson worked first as a model in Australia and in Europe before moving to Los Angeles in 1991. There she studied acting with Arthur Mendoza at the Actors Circle Theatre, and with Tom Waits at the TomKat Repertory Group. After five years of study, she was hired for some small roles in independent films such as &quot;Naked Jane&quot; and &quot;Loser&quot;. 

In 1996, she was preparing to continue her studies at an acting school in New York City, but decided to audition first for a new television show being produced for the USA cable TV channel in North America. Over 200 actresses auditioned for the starring role, and Wilson was chosen. The show was called &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot;, based on the French action thriller movie &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot; (1990). 

The hour-long series was produced by a combination of Canadian and American companies. It ran for five years and 96 episodes (22 episodes per season for four years, and another eight episodes in its fifth and final TV year). Most were filmed in and around Toronto, Ontario. Wilson&#x27;s co-stars were Roy Dupuis, Don Francks, Alberta Watson and Eugene Robert Glazer. Wilson was twice nominated for the annual Gemini Award for &quot;Best Performance by An Actress in a Continuing Leading Dramatic Role&quot;.
In 2001, Wilson took part in the Moscow International Film Festival, where she met Russian president Vladimir Putin, who confessed to being a fan of hers. She portrayed real-life actress Anny Ondra in the television movie &quot;Joe and Max&quot; (2002).

She also appeared as the vampire Mina Harker in the 2003 film &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;. 

During 2006 she appeared on an Australian TV mystery anthology drama &quot;Two Twisted&quot; and had a small role in the movie &quot;Superman Returns&quot; as the character Bobbie-Faye, a NASA spokeswoman.

In 2009, Wilson starred in an Australian independent film &quot;Beautiful&quot;. She guest starred on &quot;&quot; (2010) and &quot;The Finder&quot; (2012).

In 2012, she launched a lingerie label, Wylie Wilson, with a flagship store in Los Angeles.

In 2013, Wilson received the Best Actress Award at the Cinerockom International Film Festival for her performance as CIA agent Marla Criswell in the short film &quot;Liberator&quot;.

===Personal life===
Wilson lived with her longtime boyfriend, director Damian Harris, from 1997 until their separation in 2002. They have a son.

<text>A graphing calculator (also graphics calculator or graphic display calculator) is a handheld computer that is capable of plotting graphs, solving simultaneous equations, and performing other tasks with variables. Most popular graphing calculators are programmable calculators, allowing the user to create customized programs, typically for scientific, engineering or education applications. They have large screens that display several lines of text and calculations.

== History ==

An early graphing calculator was designed in 1921 by electrical engineer Edith Clarke. The calculator was used to solve problems with electrical power line transmission.

Casio produced the first commercially available graphing calculator in 1985. Sharp produced its first graphing calculator in 1986, with Hewlett Packard following in 1988, and Texas Instruments in 1990.

== Features ==

=== Computer algebra systems ===
Some graphing calculators have a computer algebra system (CAS), which means that they are capable of producing symbolic results. These calculators can manipulate algebraic expressions, performing operations such as factor, expand, and simplify. In addition, they can give answers in exact form without numerical approximations. Calculators that have a computer algebra system are called symbolic or CAS calculators.

=== Laboratory usage ===
Many graphing calculators can be attached to devices like electronic thermometers, pH gauges, weather instruments, decibel and light meters, accelerometers, and other sensors and therefore function as data loggers, as well as WiFi or other communication modules for monitoring, polling and interaction with the teacher. Student laboratory exercises with data from such devices enhances learning of math, especially statistics and mechanics.

===Games and utilities===

Since graphing calculators are typically user-programmable, they are also widely used for utilities and calculator gaming, with a sizable body of user-created game software on most popular platforms. The ability to create games and utilities has spurred the creation of calculator application sites (e.g., Cemetech) which, in some cases, may offer programs created using calculators&#x27; assembly language. Even though handheld gaming devices fall in a similar price range, graphing calculators offer superior math programming capability for math based games. However ,due to poor display resolution, slow processor speed and lack of a dedicated keyboard, they are mostly preferred only by high school students.

However, for developers and advanced users like researchers, analysts and gamers, third-party software development involving firmware modifications, whether for powerful gaming or exploiting capabilities beyond the published data sheet and programming language, is a contentious issue with manufacturers and education authorities as it might incite unfair calculator use during standardized high school and college tests where these devices are targeted.

== Software Graphing Calculators ==

There are many graphing calculators that do not require dedicated hardware, but run on a device in a web browser or as an app. Notable graphing calculators of this type include Desmos and GeoGebra.

== Graphing calculators in education ==
* North America – high school mathematics teachers allow and even encourage their students to use graphing calculators in class. In some cases (especially in calculus courses) they are &quot;required&quot;.
* College Board of the United States – permits the use of most graphing or CAS calculators that do not have a QWERTY-style keyboard for parts of its AP and SAT exams, but the ACT exam and IB schools do not permit the use of calculators with computer algebra systems.
* United Kingdom – a graphing calculator is allowed for A-level maths courses, however they are not required and the exams are designed to be broadly &#x27;calculator neutral&#x27;. Similarly, at GCSE, all current courses include one paper where no calculator of any kind can be used, but students are permitted to use graphical calculators for other papers. The use of graphical calculators at GCSE is not widespread with cost being a likely factor. The use of CAS is not allowed for either A-level or GCSE. Similarly, calculators with QWERTY keyboard layout are also not allowed as well. The Scottish SQA allows the use of graphic calculators in maths exams (excluding paper 1, which is exclusively non-calculator), however these should either be checked before exams by invigilators or handed out by the exam centre, as certain functions / information is not allowed to be stored on a calculator in the exam.
* Finland and Slovenia – and certain other countries, it is forbidden to use calculators with symbolic calculation (CAS) or 3D graphics features in the matriculation exam. This changed in the case of Finland, however, as symbolic calculators were allowed from spring 2012 onwards.
* Norway – calculators with wireless communication capabilities, such as IR links, have been banned at some technical universities.
* Australia – policies vary from state to state.
** Victoria – the VCE specifies approved calculators as applicable for its mathematics exams. For Further Mathematics an approved graphics calculator (for example TI-83/84, Casio 9860, HP-39G) or CAS (for example TI-89, the ClassPad series, HP-40G) can be used. Mathematical Methods (CAS) has a technology free examination consisting of short answer and some extended answer questions. It then also has a technology-active examination consisting of extended response and multiple choice questions: a CAS is the assumed technology for Mathematical Methods (CAS). Specialist Mathematics has a technology free examination and a technology-active examination where either an approved graphics calculator or CAS may be used. Calculator memories are not required to be cleared. In subjects like Physics and Chemistry, students are only allowed a standard scientific calculator.
** Western Australia – all tertiary entrance examinations in Mathematics involve a calculator section which assume the student has a graphics calculator; CAS enabled calculators are also permitted. In subjects such as Physics, Chemistry and Accounting only non-programmable calculators are permitted.
** New South Wales – graphics calculators are allowed for the General Mathematics Higher School Certificate exam, but disallowed in the higher level Mathematics courses.
* China - Only the Shanghai College Entrance Examination allows the use of calculators without graphing and memory. Except for Shanghai, the other provinces and cities do not allow the use of calculators, so calculators in general are banned in primary and secondary education in most parts of China.
* India - Calculators are prohibited in primary and secondary education. (ICSE allows the Casio fx-82MS, or equivalent scientific calculator in 12th boards). University degree and diploma courses have their own rules on use of permitted models of calculators in exams. Casio&#x27;s fx-991MS, fx-991ES, fx-100MS, and fx-350MS scientific calculators are used in many university degree and diploma courses. These calculators are also permitted for university exams as they are non-programmable since programmable calculators are not allowed for university exams. During the online GATE examinations and other competitive examinations, candidates are provided with a virtual scientific calculator as physical calculators of any type are not permitted.
* New Zealand – Calculators identified as having high-level algebraic manipulation capability are prohibited in NCEA examinations unless specifically allowed by a standard or subject prescription. This includes calculators such as the TI-89 series .
* Turkey – any type of calculator whatsoever is prohibited in all primary and high schools. 
* Singapore – graphing calculators are used in junior colleges; it is required in the Mathematics paper of the GCE &#x27;A&#x27; Levels, and most schools use the TI-84 Plus or TI-84 Plus Silver Edition.
* Netherlands – high school students are obliged to use graphing calculators during tests and exams in their final three years. Most students use the TI-83 Plus or TI-84 Plus, but other graphing calculators are allowed, including the Casio fx-9860G and HP-39G. Graphing calculators are almost always allowed to be used during tests instead of normal calculators, which sometimes results in cheat sheets being made on forehand and exchanged before the test starts using link cables.
* Israel – Graphing calculators are forbidden to use in the Bagrut (equivalent to the British A-Levels) math exam, in addition to programmable calculators. University degree and diploma courses have their own rules on use and permitted models of calculators in exams.

== Programming ==

Most graphing calculators, as well as some non-graphing scientific calculators and programmer&#x27;s calculators can be programmed to automate complex and frequently used series of calculations and those inaccessible from the keyboard.

The actual programming can often be done on a computer then later uploaded to the calculators. The most common tools for this include the PC link cable and software for the given calculator, configurable text editors or hex editors, and specialized programming tools such as the below-mentioned implementation of various languages on the computer side.

Earlier calculators stored programs on magnetic cards and the like; increased memory capacity has made storage on the calculator the most common implementation. Some of the newer machines can also use memory cards.

Many graphing and scientific calculators will tokenize the program text, replacing textual programming elements with short numerical tokens. For example, take this line of TI-BASIC code:
codice_1
. In a conventional programming language, this line of code would be nine characters long (eight not including a newline character). For a system as slow as a graphing calculator, this is too inefficient for an interpreted language. To increase program speed and coding efficiency, the above line of code would be only three characters. &quot;Disp_&quot; as a single character, &quot;[A]&quot; as a single character, and a newline character. This normally means that single byte chars will query the standard ASCII chart while two byte chars (the Disp_ for example) will build a graphical string of single byte characters but retain the two byte character in the program memory. Many graphical calculators work much like computers and use versions of 7-bit, 8-bit or 9-bit ASCII-derived character sets or even UTF-8 and Unicode. Many of them have a tool similar to the character map on Windows.

They also have BASIC like functions such as chr$, chr, char, asc, and so on, which sometimes may be more Pascal or C like. One example may be use of &quot;ord&quot;, as in Pascal, instead of the &quot;asc&quot; of many Basic variants, to return the code of a character, i.e. the position of the character in the collating sequence of the machine.

A cable and/or IrDA transceiver connecting the calculator to a computer make the process easier and expands other possibilities such as on-board spreadsheet, database, graphics, and word processing programs. The second option is being able to code the programs on board the calculator itself. This option is facilitated by the inclusion of full-screen text editors and other programming tools in the default feature set of the calculator or as optional items. Some calculators have QWERTY keyboards and others can be attached to an external keyboard which can be close to the size of a regular 102-key computer keyboard. Programming is a major use for the software and cables used to connect calculators to computers.

The most common programming languages used for calculators are similar to keystroke-macro languages and variants of BASIC. The latter can have a large feature set—approaching that of BASIC as found in computers—including character and string manipulation, advanced conditional and branching statements, sound, graphics, and more including, of course, the huge spectrum of mathematical, string, bit-manipulation, number base, I/O, and graphics functions built into the machine.

Languages for programming calculators fall into all of the main groups, i.e. machine code, low-level, mid-level, high-level languages for systems and application programming, scripting, macro, and glue languages, procedural, functional, imperative &amp;. object-oriented programming can be achieved in some cases.

Most calculators capable to being connected to a computer can be programmed in assembly language and machine code, although on some calculators this is only possible through using exploits. The most common assembly and machine languages are for TMS9900, SH-3, Zilog Z80, and various Motorola chips (e.g. a modified 68000) which serve as the main processors of the machines although many (not all) are modified to some extent from their use elsewhere. Some manufacturers do not document and even mildly discourage the assembly language programming of their machines because they must be programmed in this way by putting together the program on the PC and then forcing it into the calculator by various improvised methods.

Other on-board programming languages include purpose-made languages, variants of Eiffel, Forth, and Lisp, and Command Script facilities which are similar in function to batch/shell programming and other glue languages on computers but generally not as full featured. Ports of other languages like BBC BASIC and development of on-board interpreters for Fortran, REXX, AWK, Perl, Unix shells (e.g., bash, zsh), other shells (DOS/Windows 9x, OS/2, and Windows NT family shells as well as the related 4DOS, 4NT and 4OS2 as well as DCL), COBOL, C, Python, Tcl, Pascal, Delphi, ALGOL, and other languages are at various levels of development.

Some calculators, especially those with other PDA-like functions have actual operating systems including the TI proprietary OS for its more recent machines, DOS, Windows CE, and rarely Windows NT 4.0 Embedded et seq, and Linux. Experiments with the TI-89, TI-92, TI-92 Plus and Voyage 200 machines show the possibility of installing some variants of other systems such as a chopped-down variant of CP/M-68K, an operating system which has been used for portable devices in the past.

Tools which allow for programming the calculators in C/C++ and possibly Fortran and assembly language are used on the computer side, such as HPGCC, TIGCC and others. Flash memory is another means of conveyance of information to and from the calculator.

The on-board BASIC variants in TI graphing calculators and the languages available on the HP-48 series can be used for rapid prototyping by developers, professors, and students, often when a computer is not close at hand.

Most graphing calculators have on-board spreadsheets which usually integrate with Microsoft Excel on the computer side. At this time, spreadsheets with macro and other automation facilities on the calculator side are not on the market. In some cases, the list, matrix, and data grid facilities can be combined with the native programming language of the calculator to have the effect of a macro and scripting enabled spreadsheet.

<doc id="335005" wikidata="Q434804" url="?curid=335005" title="Dick Durbin">
<text>Richard Joseph Durbin (born November 21, 1944) is an American lawyer and politician serving as the senior United States senator from Illinois, a seat he has held since 1997. A member of the Democratic Party, Durbin is in his fifth Senate term and has served since 2005 as the Senate Democratic whip (the second-highest position in the Democratic leadership in the Senate) and since 2025 as the Senate minority whip. He chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee from 2021 to 2025, and led the Ketanji Brown Jackson Supreme Court nomination hearings.

Durbin was born in East St. Louis, Illinois. He graduated from the School of Foreign Service and the Georgetown University Law Center. Working in state legal counsel throughout the 1970s, he made an unsuccessful run for lieutenant governor of Illinois in 1978. He later maintained a private law practice and co-owned a pub in Springfield. Durbin was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982, representing the Springfield-based 20th congressional district.

After serving seven House terms, Durbin was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1996 and reelected in 2002, 2008, 2014, and 2020. He has served as the Senate Democratic whip since 2005—under Harry Reid until 2017, and under Chuck Schumer since 2017. During that time, he had two stints as Senate majority whip (from 2007 to 2015 and from 2021 to 2025), and three as minority whip (from 2005 to 2007, from 2015 to 2021, and since 2025). As of 2024, Durbin is the longest-serving Senate party whip in U.S. history. He is the dean of Illinois&#x27;s congressional delegation.
==Early life, education and career==
Durbin was born in East St. Louis, Illinois, to an Irish-American father, William Durbin, and a Lithuanian-born mother, Anna (&quot;née&quot; Kutkin; Lithuanian: Ona Kutkaitė). He graduated from Assumption High School in East St. Louis in 1962. During his high school years he worked at a meatpacking plant. He earned a B.S. from the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in 1966. Durbin interned in Senator Paul Douglas&#x27;s office during his senior year in college, and worked on Douglas&#x27;s unsuccessful 1966 reelection campaign. Durbin adopted the nickname &quot;Dick&quot;, which he did not previously use, after Douglas mistakenly called him by that name.

Durbin earned his J.D. from Georgetown University Law Center in 1969 and was admitted to the Illinois bar later that year. After graduating from law school, Durbin started a law practice in Springfield. He was legal counsel to Lieutenant Governor Paul Simon from 1969 to 1972, and then legal counsel to the Illinois State Senate Judiciary Committee from 1972 to 1982. Durbin was an unsuccessful Democratic candidate for the Illinois State Senate in 1976. From 1976 to 1981 he co-owned the Crow&#x27;s Mill Pub in Springfield&#x27;s Toronto neighborhood, which he later described as a &quot;crash course&quot; in running a business. He ran for lieutenant governor in 1978 as the running mate of State Superintendent of Schools Michael Bakalis. They were defeated by Republican incumbents Jim Thompson and Dave O&#x27;Neal. Durbin then worked as an adjunct professor of medical law at the Southern Illinois University School of Medicine for five years while maintaining his law practice.

===U.S. House of Representatives===
In 1982, Durbin won the Democratic nomination for the 20th congressional district, which included Macon and most of Springfield. He scored a 1,400-vote victory, defeating 22-year incumbent Paul Findley, a U.S. Navy veteran, whose district lines had been substantially redrawn to remove rural farms and add economically depressed Macon. This replaced 35% of the voters and included more Democrats as part of the decennial redistricting. Durbin&#x27;s campaign emphasized unemployment and financial difficulties facing farmers, and told voters that electing him would send &quot;a message to Washington and to President Reagan that our economic policies are not working.&quot; Durbin benefited from donations by pro-Israel groups, especially AIPAC, that opposed Findley&#x27;s advocacy on behalf of the Palestine Liberation Organization in the year before the election. Durbin was reelected six times, rarely facing substantial opposition, and winning more than 55% of the vote in each election except 1994.

==U.S. Senate==
In 1996, Durbin defeated Pat Quinn to become the Democratic nominee to replace the retiring Senator Paul Simon, a longtime friend. He faced Republican State Representative Al Salvi in the general election. Although the election had been expected to be competitive, Durbin benefited from Bill Clinton&#x27;s 18-point win in Illinois that year and defeated Salvi by 15 points. He was reelected in 2002, 2008, 2014 and 2020, each time by at least 10 points.

=== Leadership ===

In November 1998, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle appointed Durbin Assistant Democratic Whip. After the 2004 election, Durbin became the Democratic Whip in the 109th Congress. He became the first senator from Illinois to serve as a Senate Whip since Everett Dirksen in the late 1950s, and the fifth to serve in Senate leadership. Durbin served as assistant minority leader from 2005 to 2007, when the Democrats became the majority party in the Senate. He then assumed the role of assistant majority leader, or majority whip.

In addition to his caucus duties, Durbin chairs the Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government.

In 2000, Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore reportedly considered asking Durbin to be his running mate for Vice President of the United States. Gore ultimately chose Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman.

When Majority Leader Harry Reid faced a difficult reelection fight in 2010, some pundits predicted a possibly heated fight to succeed him between Durbin and Senator Chuck Schumer, who is well known for his fund-raising prowess. Reid&#x27;s reelection rendered such speculation moot. Upon Reid&#x27;s retirement announcement in 2015, Durbin, Reid, and Schumer were aligned in elevating Schumer to party leader and Durbin to retain the Whip position.

In 2021, Durbin became Senate Majority Whip again for the 117th Congress, as well as becoming chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee. This is the first time that the whip of either party has served as chair of this committee.

==Political positions==
In 2006, the &quot;National Journal&quot; rated Durbin as the most liberal U.S. senator. According to the 2019 Govtrack report card, he had the tenth-most left-leaning voting record in the Senate.

The American Conservative Union gave him a 5% lifetime conservative rating in 2020.

=== Social issues ===

==== Abortion ====

During his first term in Congress, Durbin supported upholding existing restrictions on abortion and imposing new limitations, including a Constitutional amendment that would have nullified &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;. Beginning in his second Senate term, he reversed his position and has since voted to maintain access to abortion, including support for Medicaid funding of it, and opposed any limitation he considers a practical or potential encroachment upon &quot;Roe&quot;. Durbin has maintained that this reversal came about due to personal reflection and his growing awareness of potentially harmful implications of his previous policy with respect to women facing dangerous pregnancies. He said, &quot;I still oppose abortion and would try my best to convince any woman in my family to carry the baby to term. But I believe that ultimately the decision must be made by the woman, her doctor, her family, and her conscience.&quot;

In September 2020, Durbin voted to confirm judges Stephen McGlynn and David W. Dugan, who have criticized Supreme Court rulings such as &quot;Roe&quot;, to lifetime appointments to the federal judiciary in Illinois. Durbin opposed the 2022 overturning of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, saying, &quot;millions of Americans are waking up in a country where they have fewer rights than their parents and grandparents.&quot;

==== Criminal justice reform ====
In July 2017, Durbin, Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, and Kamala Harris introduced the Dignity for Incarcerated Women Act, legislation implementing a ban on the shackling of pregnant women and mandating the Federal Bureau of Prisons to form superior visitation policies for parents along with providing parenting classes and health products such as tampons and pads. The bill also restricted prison employees from entering restrooms of the opposite sex except in pressing circumstances.

In December 2018, Durbin voted for the First Step Act, legislation aimed at reducing recidivism rates among federal prisoners by expanding job training and other programs in addition to expanding early-release programs and modifying sentencing laws such as mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders, &quot;to more equitably punish drug offenders.&quot;

==== Gun control ====
Durbin received an &quot;F&quot; grade from the National Rifle Association of America for his consistent support for gun control. Durbin supports a national assault weapon ban.

Durbin sent Attorney General Jeff Sessions a letter in May 2017 asking for support in expanding the Chicago Police Department&#x27;s violence prevention programs by expanding access to the Strategic Decision Support Centers and the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network. He also asked the Justice Department to support the Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act, which would stop illegal state-to-state gun trafficking.

In response to mass shootings, such as the Orlando nightclub shooting and Las Vegas shooting, Durbin has repeatedly called for expanded gun control laws, saying that Congress would be &quot;complicit&quot; in the shooting deaths of people if it did not act.

After the October 2017 Las Vegas shooting, Durbin was one of 24 senators to sign a letter to National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins espousing the view that it was critical that the NIH &quot;dedicate a portion of its resources to the public health consequences of gun violence&quot; at a time when 93 Americans die per day from gun-related fatalities and noted that the Dickey Amendment did not prohibit objective, scientific inquiries into shooting death prevention.

In January 2019, Durbin was one of 40 senators to introduce the Background Check Expansion Act, a bill that would require background checks for either the sale or transfer of all firearms including all unlicensed sellers. Exceptions to the bill&#x27;s background check requirement included transfers between members of law enforcement, loaning firearms for either hunting or sporting events temporarily, providing firearms as gifts to members of one&#x27;s immediate family, firearms transferred as part of an inheritance, or giving a firearm to another person temporarily for immediate self-defense.

==== HIV/AIDS ====
In March 2007, Durbin introduced the African Health Capacity Investment Act of 2007 to the Senate. The bill was designed so that over three years, the U.S. would supply over $600 million to help create safer medical facilities and working conditions, and to recruit and train doctors from all over North America.

In December 2007, Durbin and two other senators co-sponsored Senator John Kerry&#x27;s Nondiscrimination in Travel and Immigration Act. In March 2007, he joined 32 other senators to co-sponsor the Early Treatment for HIV Act.

==== Immigration ====
Durbin is the chief proponent of the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act. The bill would provide certain students who entered or were brought to the nation illegally with the opportunity to earn conditional permanent residency if they arrived in the U.S. as children; graduated from a U.S. high school; have been in the country continuously for at least five years before the bill&#x27;s enactment; submit biometric data; pass a criminal background check; and complete two years toward a four-year degree from an accredited university or complete at least two years in the military within a five-year period. In 2013, the Immigrant Legal Resource Center presented Durbin with the inaugural Nancy Pelosi Award for Immigration &amp; Civil Rights Policy for his leadership on this issue.

On January 28, 2013, Durbin was a member of a bipartisan group of eight senators, the Gang of Eight, which announced principles for comprehensive immigration reform (CIR).

In April 2018, Durbin was one of five senators to send acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Thomas Homan a letter about standards the agency used to determine how to detain a pregnant woman, requesting that pregnant women not be held in custody except in extraordinary circumstances after reports &quot;that ICE has failed to provide critical medical care to pregnant women in immigration detention—resulting in miscarriages and other negative health outcomes&quot;.

In July 2018, Durbin said Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen should resign over the Trump administration family separation policy. He argued it &quot;is and was a cruel policy inconsistent with the bedrock values of the nation,&quot; adding someone &quot;in this administration has to accept responsibility.&quot; Tyler Houlton, a DHS spokesman, replied on Twitter that &quot;obstructionists in Congress should get to work&quot;.

In July 2019, after reports that the Trump administration intended to end protections of spouses, parents and children of active-duty service members from deportation, Durbin was one of 22 senators to sign a letter led by Tammy Duckworth arguing that the program allowed service members the ability &quot;to fight for the United States overseas and not worry that their spouse, children, or parents will be deported while they are away&quot; and that the program&#x27;s termination would cause personal hardship for service members in combat.

In October 2019, Durbin blocked the passage of S.386, the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act, which aims to eliminate the per-country numerical limitation for all employment-based immigrants and to increase the per-country limitation for all family-sponsored immigrants from 7% to 15%.

Durbin argued that bill S.386 would prioritize people of Indian and Chinese origin, who have been in the green card backlog for years, at the expense of future immigrants from other countries. After blocking S.386, he proposed his own bill, which would almost triple the number of employment-based green cards and eliminate country caps. Durbin agreed that his bill would not pass in the current administration and promised for a bipartisan agreement to pass S.386.

==== Tobacco regulation ====
In 1987, Durbin introduced major tobacco regulation legislation in the House. The bill banned cigarette smoking on airline flights of two hours or less. Representative C. W. Bill Young joined him in saying that the rights of smokers to smoke ends where their smoking affects other people&#x27;s health and safety, such as on airplanes. The bill passed as part of the 1988 transportation spending bill. In 1989, Congress banned cigarette smoking on all domestic airline flights.

In March 1994, Durbin proposed an amendment to the Improving America&#x27;s Schools Act that required schools receiving federal drug prevention money to teach elementary and secondary students about the dangers of tobacco, drugs, and alcohol. The amendment also required schools to warn students about tobacco and teach them how to resist peer pressure to smoke.

In February 2008, Durbin called on Congress to support a measure that would allow the Food and Drug Administration to oversee the tobacco industry. The measure would require companies to disclose the contents of tobacco products, restrict advertising and promotions, and mandate the removal of harmful ingredients from tobacco products. It would also prohibit tobacco companies from using terms like &quot;low risk,&quot; &quot;light,&quot; and &quot;mild&quot; on the packaging.

Durbin attributes his stance against tobacco smoking to his father, who smoked two packs of cigarettes a day and died of lung cancer.

==== Freedom of expression ====
In 2007, speaking as Senate Majority Whip, Durbin said on record that &quot;It&#x27;s time to reinstitute the Fairness Doctrine.&quot;

In 2010, Durbin cosponsored and passed from committee the Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act, a bill to combat media piracy by blacklisting websites. Many opposed to the bill argue that it violates First Amendment rights and promotes censorship. The announcement of the bill was followed by a wave of protest from digital rights activists, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, calling it censorship and stating that action could be taken against all users of sites on which only some users are uploading infringing material.

Durbin sponsored the PROTECT IP Act.

==== Attempts to remove PAC radio advertisements ====
In July 2014, Americas PAC, a Political Action Committee designed to elect conservative Republicans, released a radio advertisement attacking Durbin&#x27;s staff salaries. This was based on a &quot;Washington Times&quot; article that stated Durbin&#x27;s female staff members made $11,000 less annually than his male staffers. In response, lawyers representing Durbin submitted a letter claiming the information in the ad was false and that the radio stations would be liable for airing the ad, with the possibility of losing their FCC license. The radio station stated the sources provided to back up the information provided by Americas PAC were checked and verified and that they would keep the ad on air.

=== Economic issues ===

==== Child care ====
In 2019, Durbin and 34 other senators introduced the Child Care for Working Families Act. The bill was expected to create 770,000 new child care jobs and ensure families under 75% of the state median income would not pay for child care, with higher-earning families having to pay &quot;their fair share for care on a sliding scale, regardless of the number of children they have.&quot; The legislation also supported universal access to high-quality preschool programs for all three- and four-year-olds. Additionally, it would have changed child care compensation and training to aid both teachers and caregivers. The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, where it did not receive a hearing or vote.

====2007–2008 financial crisis====
On September 18, 2008, Durbin attended a closed meeting with congressional leaders, then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, and was urged to craft legislation to help financially troubled banks. That same day (trade effective the next day), Durbin sold mutual fund shares worth $42,696 and reinvested it all with Warren Buffett.

On February 26, 2009, Durbin introduced the Protecting Consumers from Unreasonable Credit Rates Act of 2009, calling for a maximum annual interest rate cap of 36%, including all interest and fees. The bill was intended to put an end to predatory lending activities.

In an April 27, 2009, interview with WJJG talk radio host Ray Hanania, Durbin said banks were responsible for the 2007–2008 financial crisis. He added that many of the banks responsible for the crisis &quot;own the place&quot;, referring to the power the banking lobby wields on Capitol Hill.

==== Trade ====
In January 2005, Durbin changed his longstanding position on sugar tariffs and price supports. After several years of voting to keep sugar quotas and price supports, he now favors abolishing the program. &quot;The sugar program depended on congressmen like me from states that grew corn&quot;, Durbin said, referring to the fact that, though they were formerly a single entity, the sugar market and the corn syrup market are now largely separate.

In May 2006, Durbin campaigned to maintain a $0.54 per gallon tariff on imported ethanol. He justified the tariff by joining Barack Obama in stating that &quot;ethanol imports are neither necessary nor a practical response to current gasoline prices&quot;, arguing instead that domestic ethanol production is sufficient and expanding. The American Coalition for Ethanol gave him a rating of 100%.

American Airlines praised Durbin for arguing for the need to lower rising oil prices.

==== Environment ====
Among Durbin&#x27;s legislative causes are environmental protection, particularly the protection of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The League of Conservation Voters gives him a rating of 89%. Sierra Club gives him a 90% rating.

==== Rod Blagojevich ====
Shortly after Governor Rod Blagojevich&#x27;s arrest on federal corruption charges on December 9, 2008, Durbin called for the Illinois legislature to quickly pass legislation for a special election to fill then-President-elect Barack Obama&#x27;s vacant Senate seat. He stated that no United States Senate appointment of Blagojevich&#x27;s could produce a credible replacement.

Durbin and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid led all 50 members of the Senate Democratic Caucus in writing Blagojevich to urge him to resign and not name a successor to Obama following Blagojevich&#x27;s arrest.

==== Transportation ====
Durbin has been a major proponent of expanded Amtrak funding and support.

==== Election finance ====
Durbin reintroduced the Fair Elections Now Act during the 112th Congress. The bill would provide public funds to candidates who do not take political donations larger than $100 from any donor.

=== Foreign and military policy ===

==== China ====
In April 2017, Durbin was one of eight Democratic senators to sign a letter to President Trump noting government-subsidized Chinese steel had been placed into the American market in recent years below cost and had hurt the domestic steel industry and the iron ore industry that fed it, calling on Trump to raise the steel issue with President of the People&#x27;s Republic of China Xi Jinping in his meeting with him.

==== Darfur ====
On March 2, 2005, then-Senator Jon Corzine presented the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act (S. 495) to the Senate. Durbin was one of 40 senators to co-sponsor the bill. The bill asked all people involved in or deemed in some way responsible for the genocide in Darfur to be denied visas and entrance to the U.S.

In 2006, Durbin co-sponsored the Durbin-Leahy Amendment to the Supplemental Appropriations bill for emergency funding to instill peace in Darfur. In 2006, he also co-sponsored the Lieberman Resolution and the Clinton Amendment.

On June 7, 2007, Durbin introduced the Sudan Disclosure Enforcement Act, which was aimed &quot;at enhancing the U.S. Government&#x27;s ability to impose penalties on violators of U.S. sanctions against Sudan.&quot; The bill called for the U.N. Security Council to vote on sanctions against the Sudanese Government for the genocide in Darfur.

Durbin has voted for all Darfur-related legislation. In addition to the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act, he also supported the Civilian Protection No-Fly Zone Act, the Hybrid Force Resolution, and the Sudan Divestment Authorization Act.

==== Myanmar ====
In October 2017, Durbin condemned the genocide of the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar and called for a stronger response to it.

==== Guantanamo Bay ====
In 2005, Durbin compared the U.S. treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base to the atrocities committed by &quot;Nazis, Soviets in their gulags, or some mad regime—Pol Pot or others—that had no concern for human beings.&quot; Demands that he apologize were initially rebuffed, but Durbin later apologized to the military for his remarks, which he said were &quot;a very poor choice of words.&quot;

===== Guantanamo interrogation criticism =====
Durbin received media attention on June 14, 2005, when in the U.S. Senate chambers he compared interrogation techniques used at Camp X-Ray, Guantanamo Bay, as reported by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to those utilized by such regimes as Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, and the Khmer Rouge:

Durbin&#x27;s comments drew widespread criticism that comparing U.S. actions to such regimes insulted the United States and victims of genocide. Radio host Rush Limbaugh and White House deputy chief of staff Karl Rove accused him of treason, while former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich called on the Senate to censure him. Chicago Mayor Richard Daley, whose son Patrick was serving in U.S. Army, also called on Durbin to apologize for his remarks, saying that he thought it was a &quot;disgrace to say that any man or woman in the military would act like that.&quot; John Wertheim, Democratic state party chairman of New Mexico, and Jim Pederson, Arizona Democratic party chairman, also criticized Durbin&#x27;s remarks. The leader of the Veterans of Foreign Wars also demanded an apology, as did the Anti-Defamation League.

Durbin initially did not apologize, but on June 21, 2005, he went before the Senate, saying, &quot;More than most people, a senator lives by his words ... occasionally words fail us, occasionally we will fail words.&quot;

Former &quot;The New Republic&quot; editor Andrew Sullivan praised Durbin for raising serious moral issues about U.S. policy. Other commentators, including commentator Markos Moulitsas Zúniga of &quot;Daily Kos&quot;, condemned Durbin for apologizing to his critics, arguing he made a mistake in making himself, rather than detention and torture concerns at Guantanamo Bay, the focus of media coverage.

==== Impeachment trials of Bill Clinton and Donald Trump ====
On February 12, 1999, Durbin joined all Democrats in the Senate in voting to acquit Bill Clinton on both impeachment articles in Clinton&#x27;s impeachment trial. On February 5, 2020, Durbin voted to convict Donald Trump on both impeachment articles in Trump&#x27;s first impeachment trial. On February 13, 2021, Durbin voted to convict Trump again in Trump&#x27;s second impeachment trial.

==== 2001 invasion of Afghanistan ====
Durbin voted to approve the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists. This act granted the executive broad military powers and was used to justify the 2001 U.S. invasion of Afghanistan and later military interventions.

==== Iraq War ====
On September 9, 2002, Durbin was the first of four Democratic senators (the others being Bob Graham, Dianne Feinstein, and Carl Levin) on the Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI), responding to the Bush administration&#x27;s request for a joint resolution authorizing a preemptive war on Iraq without having prepared a National Intelligence Estimate (NIE), to ask Central Intelligence Director George Tenet to prepare an NIE on the status of Iraq&#x27;s Weapon of mass destruction programs. Durbin was also one of few senators who read the resulting October 1, 2002, NIE, &quot;Iraq&#x27;s Continuing Programs for Weapons of Mass Destruction&quot;.

On September 29, 2002, Durbin held a news conference in Chicago to announce that &quot;absent dramatic changes&quot; in the resolution, he would vote against the resolution authorizing war on Iraq. On October 2, at the first high-profile Chicago anti-Iraq War rally in Federal Plaza, he repeated his promise to oppose the resolution in a letter read during the rally.

On October 10, the U.S. Senate failed to pass Durbin&#x27;s amendment to the resolution to strike &quot;the continuing threat posed by Iraq&quot; and insert &quot;an imminent threat posed by Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction&quot;, by a 30–70 vote, with most Democratic senators voting for the amendment and 21 joining all 49 Republican senators voting against it. On October 11, Durbin was one of 23 senators to vote against the joint resolution authorizing the Iraq War.

On April 25, 2007, Durbin said that as an intelligence committee member he knew in 2002 from classified information that the Bush Administration was misleading the American people into a war on Iraq, but could not reveal this because, as an intelligence committee member, he was sworn to secrecy. This revelation prompted an online attack ad against Durbin by the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

==== Russia ====
Durbin spearheaded a nonbinding resolution in July 2018 &quot;warning President Trump not to let the Russian government question diplomats and other officials&quot;. The resolution states the U.S. &quot;should refuse to make available any current or former diplomat, civil servant, political appointee, law enforcement official or member of the Armed Forces of the United States for questioning by the government of Vladimir Putin&quot;. It passed 98–0.

In December 2018, after United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the Trump administration was suspending its obligations in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 60 days if Russia continued to violate the treaty, Durbin was one of 26 senators to sign a letter expressing concern over the administration &quot;now abandoning generations of bipartisan U.S. leadership around the paired goals of reducing the global role and number of nuclear weapons and ensuring strategic stability with America&#x27;s nuclear-armed adversaries&quot; and calling on Trump to continue arms negotiations.

==== Saudi Arabia ====
In March 2019, Durbin was one of 10 Democratic senators to sign a letter to Salman of Saudi Arabia requesting the release of human rights lawyer Waleed Abu al-Khair and writer Raif Badawi, women&#x27;s rights activists Loujain al-Hathloul and Samar Badawi, and Dr. Walid Fitaih. The senators wrote, &quot;Not only have reputable international organizations detailed the arbitrary detention of peaceful activists and dissidents without trial for long periods, but the systematic discrimination against women, religious minorities and mistreatment of migrant workers and others has also been well-documented.&quot;

==== Israel-Palestine ====
In his 1982 campaign, Durbin benefited from donations by pro-Israel groups, especially AIPAC, that opposed Paul Findley&#x27;s advocacy on behalf of the Palestine Liberation Organization in the year before the election.

In 2019, Durbin co-signed a Senate resolution affirming support for a two-state solution and opposition to a proposed Israeli annexation of the West Bank. In November 2023, Durbin was the first U.S. senator to call for a ceasefire in the Israel–Hamas war.

In January 2024, Durbin voted against a resolution, proposed by Senator Bernie Sanders, to apply the human rights provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act to U.S. aid to Israel&#x27;s military. The proposal was defeated, 72 to 11. In March 2024, Durbin urged the Biden administration to recognize a &quot;nonmilitarized&quot; Palestinian state after the end of the war in Gaza.

==== Drone warfare ====
In April 2013, Durbin chaired a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Human Rights about the moral, legal and constitutional issues surrounding targeted killings and the use of drones. Durbin said, &quot;Many in the national security community are concerned that we may undermine our counterterrorism efforts if we do not carefully measure the benefits and costs of targeted killing.&quot;

=== Other positions ===
In October 2007, Durbin opposed a bill in the Illinois General Assembly that would allow three casinos to be built, saying, &quot;I really, really think we ought to stop and catch our breath and say, &#x27;Is this the future of Illinois? That every time we want to do something we&#x27;ll just build more casinos?&#x27;&quot;

In August 2013, Durbin was one of 23 Democratic senators to sign a letter to the Defense Department warning of some payday lenders &quot;offering predatory loan products to service members at exorbitant triple-digit effective interest rates and loan products that do not include the additional protections envisioned by the law&quot; and asserting that service members and their families &quot;deserve the strongest possible protections and swift action to ensure that all forms of credit offered to members of our armed forces are safe and sound.&quot;

In March 2018, Durbin was one of 10 senators to sign a letter spearheaded by Jeff Merkley lambasting a proposal by FCC Chairman Ajit Pai that would curb the scope of benefits from the Lifeline program during a period when roughly 6.5 million people in poor communities relied on Lifeline to receive access to high-speed internet, arguing that it was Pai&#x27;s &quot;obligation to the American public, as the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, to improve the Lifeline program and ensure that more Americans can afford access, and have means of access, to broadband and phone service.&quot; The senators also advocated insuring that &quot;Lifeline reaches more Americans in need of access to communication services.&quot;

In April 2019, Durbin was one of 34 senators to sign a letter to Trump encouraging him &quot;to listen to members of your own Administration and reverse a decision that will damage our national security and aggravate conditions inside Central America&quot;, asserting that Trump had &quot;consistently expressed a flawed understanding of U.S. foreign assistance&quot; since becoming president and that he was &quot;personally undermining efforts to promote U.S. national security and economic prosperity&quot; by preventing the use of Fiscal Year 2018 national security funding. The senators argued that foreign assistance to Central American countries created less migration to the U.S. by helping to improve conditions in those countries.

In April 2019, Durbin was one of six senators to send CFPB director Kathy Kraninger a letter expressing concern that &quot;CFPB leadership has abandoned its supervision and enforcement activities related to federal student loan servicers&quot; and opining that such behavior displayed &quot;a shocking disregard for the financial well-being of our nation&#x27;s public servants, including teachers, first responders, and members of the military.&quot; The senators requested that Kraninger clarify the CFPB&#x27;s role in overseeing the Public Service Loan Forgiveness&#x27;s student loan servicers handling since December 2017, such as examinations.

In April 2019, Durbin was one of 41 senators to sign a bipartisan letter to the housing subcommittee praising the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development&#x27;s Section 4 Capacity Building program as authorizing &quot;HUD to partner with national nonprofit community development organizations to provide education, training, and financial support to local community development corporations (CDCs) across the country&quot; and expressing disappointment that Trump&#x27;s budget &quot;has slated this program for elimination after decades of successful economic and community development.&quot; The senators wrote of their hope that the subcommittee would support continued funding for Section 4 in Fiscal Year 2020.

In June 2019, Durbin was one of 15 senators to introduce the Affordable Medications Act, legislation intended to promote transparency by mandating that pharmaceutical companies disclose the amount of money going toward research and development in addition to both marketing and executives&#x27; salaries. The bill also abolished the restriction that stopped the federal Medicare program from using its buying power to negotiate lower drug prices for beneficiaries and hinder drug company monopoly practices used to keep prices high and disable less expensive generics entering the market.

In August 2019, Durbin, three other Senate Democrats, and Bernie Sanders signed a letter to Acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless in response to Novartis falsifying data as part of an attempt to gain the FDA&#x27;s approval for its new gene therapy Zolgensma, writing that it was &quot;unconscionable that a drug company would provide manipulated data to federal regulators in order to rush its product to market, reap federal perks, and charge the highest amount in American history for its medication.&quot;

Durbin was participating in the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count when pro-Trump rioters attacked the U.S. Capitol. Along with other senators and staff, Durbin ran out of the Senate Chamber after the attackers, whom he called &quot;extremists&quot;, breached the Capitol. He then evacuated to a secure location with Pelosi, McConnell and Schumer. Durbin blamed Trump for the attack. He also said Senator Josh Hawley was partially responsible for the attack. He called for Trump&#x27;s removal through the invocation of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution or impeachment.

==Electoral history==













































==Personal life==
=== Family ===
Durbin and his wife Loretta have had three children, Christine, Jennifer and Paul. After several weeks in the hospital with complications due to a congenital heart condition, Christine died on November 1, 2008, at age 40.

As of 2023, according to CAKnowledge.com, Durbin&#x27;s net worth is $10 million. In June 2024, Durbin underwent a hip replacement surgery.

=== Conflict of interest issues ===
Durbin&#x27;s wife was a lobbyist, and it was reported by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; in 2014 that some of her &quot;clients have received federal funding promoted by [Durbin]&quot;. In addition to announcing the award of monies to ten clients of his wife&#x27;s lobbying firm, these conflicts included her lobbying firm receiving a one-year contract with a housing nonprofit group around the time Durbin went to bat for the organization; a state university receiving funds through an earmark by Durbin when his wife was its lobbyist; and Durbin arranging federal money for a public health nonprofit when his wife was seeking state support for the same group. The Durbins maintain that they try to avoid conflicts of interest.

=== Religion ===
Durbin is a Roman Catholic. In 2004, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Springfield in Illinois barred him from receiving communion because he voted against the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. The current bishop of the diocese said Durbin stays away from his Springfield parish because &quot;he doesn&#x27;t want to make a scene&quot;. Durbin responded to the communion ban in 2004 that he is accountable to his constituents, even if it means defying Church teachings. In 2018, Bishop Thomas John Paprocki affirmed the decision to deny Durbin communion in the Springfield Diocese after Durbin&#x27;s vote against the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.

In 2017, Durbin was criticized for requesting a clarification from then Court of Appeals nominee Amy Coney Barrett during her Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing about her self-descriptive terminology &quot;orthodox Catholic.&quot; He contended that such terminology might unfairly characterize Catholics who may not agree with the church&#x27;s positions about abortion or the death penalty. Barrett had written in an article that &quot;litigants and the general public are entitled to impartial justice, and that may be something that a judge who is heedful of ecclesiastical pronouncements cannot dispense&quot;. Barrett also opined that judges aren&#x27;t bound by precedent conflicting with the Constitution. She wrote that judges could recuse themselves from hearing matters if their faith conflicted with issues to be decided in cases they might otherwise hear. Senator Dianne Feinstein said, &quot;Senators must inquire about these issues when considering lifetime appointments because ensuring impartiality and fidelity to precedent are critical for the rule of law&quot;. The issue prompted questions regarding the application of Article VI, Section 3 of the Constitution, which mandates: &quot;No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.&quot;

<text>Ashok Kumar (born Kumudlal Ganguly; 13 October 1911 – 10 December 2001), was an Indian actor who attained iconic status in Indian cinema. He was considered the first big star of Indian cinema as well as the first lead actor to play an anti-hero. He also became the first star to reinvent himself, enjoying a long and hugely successful career as a character actor. He was a member of the cinematic Ganguly family. He was honoured in 1988 with the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, the highest national award for cinema artists, by the Government of India. He received the Padma Shri in 1962 and Padma Bhushan in 1999 for his contributions to Indian cinema.

== Background and personal life ==
Ashok Kumar was born Kumudlal Ganguly to a Hindu Bengali Brahmin family in Bhagalpur, Bengal Presidency, British India (present-day Bihar, India). His father, Kunjlal Ganguly, was a lawyer while his mother, Gouri Devi, was a housewife. Kumudlal was the eldest of four children. His only sister, Sati Devi, a few years younger than him, was married at a very young age to Sashadhar Mukherjee and became the matriarch of a large &quot;film family&quot;. Next was his brother, Kalyan, 16 years younger (b.1927), who later took the screen name Anoop Kumar. Youngest of all was Abhas (b.1929), whose screen name was Kishore Kumar, who became a phenomenally successful playback singer in Hindi films. Although the eldest by several years, Kumudlal outlived all his siblings. In fact, he stopped celebrating his birthday after his youngest brother, Kishore, died on that day in 1987.

While still a teenager and well before he had even given thought to a career in films, the young Kumudlal was married to Shobha (a first cousin of actress Chhaya Devi), a girl of his own Bengali Brahmin community and similar family background, in a match arranged by their parents in the usual Indian way. Their lifelong marriage was a harmonious and conventional one, and despite his film career, the couple retained a very middle-class outlook and value system, bringing up their children with traditional values in a remarkably simple home. They were the parents of one son, Aroop Ganguly, and three daughters named Bharati Patel, Rupa Verma and Preeti Ganguly. Aroop Kumar Ganguly worked in only one film, appearing as a hero in &quot;Bezubaan&quot; (1962), which flopped at the box office. He then made a career in the corporate world. The eldest daughter, Bharati Patel, is the mother of the actress Anuradha Patel. His second eldest daughter, Rupa Ganguly, is a former actress and widow of actor-comedian Deven Verma. The youngest daughter, Preeti Ganguly acted as a comedienne in several Hindi films during the 1970s and 1980s and died unmarried in 2012.

Kumudlal&#x27;s daughter Bharati married twice. Her first marriage was to Dr. Veerendra Patel, a Gujarati doctor. Through this marriage, she had two sons, Rahul and Rohit, and one daughter, the actress Anuradha Patel, who is married to the actor Kanwaljit Singh. Later, and much against the wishes of all her relatives, Bharati married Hameed Jaffrey, a Muslim, the brother of the actor Saeed Jaffrey. By this second marriage, Bharati had one son, Saahil, and also acquired step-daughters, Geneviève and Shaheen, who were Hameed&#x27;s daughters by his first wife Valerie Salway, a woman of Scottish, Irish, Portuguese and Spanish heritage. Geneviève married a Sindhi businessman named Jagdeep Advani. Their daughter is actress Kiara Advani. Thus, Ashok Kumar has no blood relationship with Kiara Advani but he is related to her in her family tree. In all, Kumar had eight biological grandchildren - Bharati&#x27;s four children Rahul, Rohit, Anuradha and Saahil, and Aroop&#x27;s four children Rishi, Mihir, Tushar and Somdatta (from his marriage to Nirmala Ganguly), in addition to his step-granddaughters Geneviève and Shaheen.

Kumar was educated at Presidency College of the University of Calcutta, Kolkata, where he studied to become a lawyer. However, his heart was not in his law studies. Ganguly was more interested in cinema, in which he dreamt of working as a technician.

== Career ==
=== Debut and breakthrough (1936–1942) ===

Kumar reluctantly made his debut in the year 1936 with Franz Osten&#x27;s &quot;Jeevan Naiya&quot; alongside Devika Rani.

His breakthrough came the same year with another Franz Osten&#x27;s film &quot;Achhut Kannya&quot; which was a reformist piece featuring a Brahmin boy falling in love with a girl from the so-called untouchables in Indian society.
After the huge box office success of &quot;Achhut Kanya&quot;, he delivered a hat-trick of silver jubilee hits with &quot;Kangan&quot; (1939), &quot;Bandhan&quot; (1940) and &quot;Jhoola&quot; (1941), all opposite Leela Chitnis.

=== Superstardom (1943–1959) ===

In 1943, Ashok Kumar played the lead role in Gyan Mukherjee&#x27;s drama film &quot;Kismet&quot; opposite Mumtaz Shanti. It became the first film to present the main lead as an anti-hero as well as an unmarried girl getting pregnant. Despite having themes considered way ahead of times, &quot;Kismet&quot; became the first Indian film to do a nett business of and emerged an &quot;All Time Blockbuster&quot; at the box office. It ran in Kolkata&#x27;s Roxy Cinema for 184 weeks, a record which remains unbroken till date. &quot;Kismet&quot; also got the tag of being the first true blue mega blockbuster in the history of Indian cinema. Its music, especially the patriotic song &quot;Aaj Himalay Ki Choti Se&quot; written by Kavi Pradeep was highly successful and played big role in making &quot;Kismet&quot; a box office sensation. The mass hysteria created by &quot;Kismet&quot; made Kumar the first big superstar of Indian cinema. Such was his popularity at the time that, in the words of Manṭo, &quot;Ashok&#x27;s popularity grew each passing day. He seldom ventured out, but wherever he was spotted, he was mobbed. Traffic would come to a stop and often the police would have to use lathis to disperse his fans&quot;. The huge box office success of &quot;Kismet&quot; was followed by films, such as Gyan Mukherjee&#x27;s &quot;Chal Chal Re Naujawan&quot; (1944), Mehboob Khan&#x27;s &quot;Humayun&quot; (1945) and Kishore Sahu&#x27;s &quot;Sajan&quot; (1947), all three of which received critical acclaim and emerged box office hits.

In 1949, Kumar produced and starred in Kamal Amrohi&#x27;s &quot;Mahal&quot;, which had Madhubala in her debut. Recalled as Hindi cinema&#x27;s first horror film, &quot;Mahal&quot; went on to become a blockbuster at the box office and third highest-grossing film of the year, behind &quot;Barsaat&quot; and &quot;Andaz&quot;. The film made Madhubala an overnight sensation and launched the career of Lata Mangeshkar who sang Aayega Aanewala, which remains popular till date. &quot;Mahal&quot; also became the source of inspiration for several films like &quot;Madhumati&quot; (1958), &quot;Karz&quot; (1980) and &quot;Om Shanti Om&quot; (2007). The early-1950s saw the rise of younger crop of stars like Dilip Kumar, Dev Anand and Raj Kapoor, but Kumar remained rock-steady and continued to deliver huge hits throughout the decade. In 1950, Kumar delivered another blockbuster and highest-earning film of the year with Ramesh Saigal&#x27;s &quot;Samadhi&quot; opposite Nalini Jaywant. That same year, he reunited with Jaywant and Gyan Mukherjee for &quot;Sangram&quot;. After &quot;Kismet&quot;, Kumar again donned the hat of anti-hero for &quot;Sangram&quot;, in turn adding another huge hit in his kitty. In 1951, he starred in B. R. Chopra&#x27;s crime drama film &quot;Afsana&quot; and Nitin Bose&#x27;s romantic musical &quot;Deedar&quot;. &quot;Afsana&quot; in which Kumar played a double role was the first hit of Chopra as a filmmaker and made him a notable name in the industry while &quot;Deedar&quot; co-starring Nargis and Dilip Kumar also proved to be a major commercial success. 

Kumar&#x27;s only notable release of 1952 was M. L. Anand&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Bewafa&quot; which also had Nargis and Raj Kapoor in the lead. In 1953, he produced and starred in Bimal Roy&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Parineeta&quot; alongside Meena Kumari. Based upon the 1914 Bengali novel of the same name by Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay, it proved to be a critical and commercial success. Post-&quot;Parineeta&quot;, Kumar had three unsuccessful ventures in &quot;Baadbaan&quot; (1954), &quot;Sardar&quot; (1955) and &quot;Bandish&quot; (1955), but this changed with a superhit in B. R. Chopra&#x27;s family drama film &quot;Ek Hi Raasta&quot; (1956), acting alongside Meena Kumari and Sunil Dutt. He also had successes in M. V. Raman&#x27;s &quot;Bhai-Bhai&quot; and Shakti Samanta&#x27;s &quot;Inspector&quot;, the same year and Devendra Goel&#x27;s &quot;Ek Saal&quot;, the next year.

In 1958, Kumar added one more superhit in his kitty with Satyen Bose&#x27;s musical comedy &quot;Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi&quot;, which also had his brothers Anoop Kumar and Kishore Kumar in the lead. The film gained cult status in later years and got remade twice in Hindi and once in Marathi. Its soundtrack composed by S. D. Burman was highly successful with a number of hit songs, including &quot;Babu Samjho Ishaare&quot;, &quot;Ek Ladki Bheegi Bhaagi Si&quot;, &quot;Hum The Woh Thi Aur Sama Rangeen&quot; and &quot;Haal Kaisa Hai Janaab Ka&quot;. His other major release of the year was Shakti Samanta&#x27;s crime thriller &quot;Howrah Bridge&quot; which had Madhubala opposite him. The film opened to positive response from critics and proved to be a hit. Its dance numbers - &quot;Mera Naam Chin Chin Chu&quot; sung by Geeta Dutt which brought fame to Helen and &quot;Aaiye Meharban&quot; sung by Asha Bhosle were hugely popular among the masses. Kumar&#x27;s last notable film in his prime came with Yash Chopra&#x27;s maiden directional venture &quot;Dhool Ka Phool&quot; (1959), co-starring Mala Sinha, Rajendra Kumar and Nanda. It opened to critical acclaim and emerged a blockbuster at the box office.

=== Continued success, acclaim and expansion to television (1960–1984) ===

With the beginning of the 1960s, Kumar was open to all kind of roles, whether as main lead, second lead, or in a character role. This prevented him from being type-cast and he continued to receive acclaim for his work.

It started with B. R. Chopra&#x27;s courtroom drama &quot;Kanoon&quot; (1960) which also had Rajendra Kumar and Nanda in the lead. Despite not having any songs and other gimmicks required in a commercial Hindi film, &quot;Kanoon&quot; emerged a hit and went on to win National Film Award for Best Feature Film (Hindi). After playing a brief role in Yash Chopra&#x27;s critically acclaimed partition drama &quot;Dharmputra&quot; (1961), the following year, he did lead roles in A. Bhimsingh&#x27;s &quot;Rakhi&quot; and Phani Majumdar&#x27;s &quot;Aarti&quot;. Both &quot;Rakhi&quot; and &quot;Aarti&quot; received critical acclaim and proved to be box office hits. Kumar received his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of a doting brother in &quot;Rakhi&quot;. 1963 proved to be a hugely successful year for Kumar with many successes. He first collaborated with B. R. Chopra for the romantic thriller &quot;Gumrah&quot; co-starring Sunil Dutt, Mala Sinha, Shashikala and Nirupa Roy. &quot;Gumrah&quot; did very well at the box office and proved to be a superhit. For his performance in the film, Kumar won his first BFJA Award for Best Actor (Hindi). The film won National Film Award for Third Best Feature Film in Hindi. This was followed by Bimal Roy&#x27;s critically and commercially successful drama film &quot;Bandini&quot;. &quot;Bandini&quot; was the last feature film directed by Roy and won him his final Filmfare Award for Best Director along with National Film Award for Best Feature Film (Hindi) as well as Filmfare Award for Best Film. Before the end of year, he reunited with Rajendra Kumar in H. S. Rawail&#x27;s muslim social &quot;Mere Mehboob&quot;, co-starring Sadhana and Nimmi. The film topped box office chart in 1963 and emerged an &quot;All Time Blockbuster&quot;. Its music composed by Naushad dominated the year-end annual list of Binaca Geetmala and was the second best-selling Hindi film album of the 1960s. 

In 1964, Kumar delivered two moderately successful films with A. Bhimsingh&#x27;s &quot;Pooja Ke Phool&quot; and Inder Raj Anand&#x27;s &quot;Phoolon Ki Sej&quot; which had Dharmendra and Manoj Kumar in the lead respectively, but his other releases, such as &quot;Chitralekha&quot; and &quot;Benazir&quot; flopped at the box office. In 1965, he had a hit in &quot;Bheegi Raat&quot; and a semi-hit in &quot;Oonche Log&quot;. The hit streak continued in 1966 with Asit Sen&#x27;s &quot;Mamta&quot; which again had Dharmendra in the lead along with Suchitra Sen who played a double role. It was a successful venture domestically, but an &quot;All Time Blockbuster&quot; in overseas markets. The same year, Kumar also appeared in Brij Sadanah&#x27;s &quot;Afsana&quot; which was a box office failure, but won him Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor. 1967 was a notable year for him as he starred in two of the biggest hits of the year - Vijay Anand&#x27;s spy heist thriller &quot;Jewel Thief&quot; and A. Bhimsingh&#x27;s light hearted drama film &quot;Mehrban&quot;. Both the films proved to be critical and commercial successes with Kumar getting applauded for his performances in them and receiving a nomination in the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor category for the latter. 

In 1968, he played the lead role in Hrishikesh Mukherjee&#x27;s social drama &quot;Aashirwad&quot;. Although the film did not do well at the box office, it was a huge critical success, winning National Film Award for Best Feature Film (Hindi). Kumar&#x27;s portrayal of a loving father was very well received and won him all the major accolades that year, such as National Film Award for Best Actor, Filmfare Award for Best Actor and BFJA Award for Best Actor (Hindi). One of its song &quot;Rail Gaadi Chhuk Chhuk Chhuk Chhuk&quot; sung by Kumar himself is considered the first rap song of Indian cinema. Kumar ended the decade on a high. He co-starred alongside Sanjay Khan and Sadhana in R.K. Nayyar&#x27;s mystery thriller &quot;Intaqam&quot; which went on to become a superhit at the box office. He then did a guest appearance in Samanta&#x27;s romantic blockbuster &quot;Aradhana&quot; which made Rajesh Khanna a superstar. Kumar also reunited with Hrishikesh Mukherjee for drama film &quot;Satyakam&quot; which like their previous collaboration &quot;Aashirwad&quot; met with immense acclaim and won National Film Award for Best Feature Film (Hindi).

The 1970s saw the domination of whole new generation of stars, including Rajesh Khanna, Dharmendra, Amitabh Bachchan, Manoj Kumar, Shashi Kapoor, Vinod Khanna, Jeetendra and Rishi Kapoor. Kumar worked with all of them in various successful and acclaimed films. In 1970, he played important roles in two directional ventures of Asit Sen, &quot;Sharafat&quot; co-starring Dharmendra, Hema Malini and &quot;Safar&quot; which also had Rajesh Khanna, Sharmila Tagore, Feroz Khan in the lead. Both the films emerged superhits and received big thumbs from reviewers, especially &quot;Safar&quot; which won Sen his first Filmfare Award for Best Director. He also collaborated with Manoj Kumar for his second directional, the patriotic drama &quot;Purab Aur Paschim&quot;, which proved to be a blockbuster in India as well as overseas. The following year, he appeared in acclaimed ventures, such &quot;Naya Zamana&quot;, &quot;Guddi&quot; and &quot;Adhikar&quot;. In 1972, he starred in Kamal Amrohi&#x27;s magnum opus &quot;Pakeezah&quot; which had Meena Kumari as the eponymous lead, alongside Raaj Kumar. Despite getting mixed reviews and being a slow starter, it went on to become a massive blockbuster and also the final film appearance of Kumari who passed away few weeks after its release. Kumar then played the role of a doting grandfather in Samanta&#x27;s &quot;Anuraag&quot; and a crook in Sadanah&#x27;s &quot;Victoria No. 203&quot;. Both the films emerged superhits with Kumar again getting nominated in the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor category for &quot;Anuraag&quot;. That same year, he reunited with Rajesh Khanna for &quot;Maalik&quot; and &quot;Dil Daulat Duniya&quot;, but contrary to expectations, both the films flopped commercially. 

Kumar played small roles in both of his major releases of 1973 and 1974 which were - &quot;Dhund&quot; and &quot;Prem Nagar&quot;, respectively. In 1975, he had a superhit in &quot;Chori Mera Kaam&quot; co-starring Shashi Kapoor and Zeenat Aman. He also appeared alongside Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan in &quot;Mili&quot;. It did average business, but won massive acclaim and is now considered a film ahead of its times. The following year, Kumar saw four profitable ventures in &quot;Ek Se Badhkar Ek&quot;, &quot;Barood&quot;, &quot;Chhoti Si Baat&quot; and &quot;Suntan&quot;. He received his fifth and final nomination in the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor category for his heartfelt portrayal of a retired colonel in &quot;Chhoti Si Baat&quot;. His other successful films of the decade, include &quot;Dream Girl&quot; (1977), &quot;Anand Ashram&quot; (1977), &quot;Safed Jhooth&quot; (1977), &quot;Chala Murari Hero Banne&quot; (1977), &quot;Dil Aur Deewaar&quot; (1978), &quot;Anpadh&quot; (1978) and &quot;Khatta Meetha&quot; (1978).

Kumar began the next decade with supporting role in four hit films, including &quot;Khubsoorat&quot;, &quot;Jyoti Bane Jwala&quot;, &quot;Sau Din Saas Ke&quot; and &quot;Judaai&quot;. In 1981, he had two more box office successes with Shibu Mitra&#x27;s &quot;Maan Gaye Ustaad&quot; and Pramod Chakravarty&#x27;s &quot;Jyoti&quot;. He then played the lead role in Basu Chatterjee&#x27;s comedy drama &quot;Shaukeen&quot; (1982), which was a commercial as well as critical success and is now considered a cult classic. In 1983, he appeared in another of Basu Chatterjee&#x27;s acclaimed venture &quot;Pasand Apni Apni&quot; and Sunil Dutt&#x27;s drama film &quot;Dard Ka Rishta&quot;, which proved to be a box office hit. The following year, Kumar made his television debut with the soap opera &quot;Hum Log&quot;, which was telecasted on Doordarshan and presented the story of an Indian middle-class family from the 1980s and their daily struggles. Every episode ended with the Kumar in a sharp suit and dark glasses explaining the theme of the day and prodding viewers to think about what they had just watched. During its 1 and a half-year run, he received over 400,000 letters from young viewers, asking him to convince their parents in marriage of their choice. The show proved to be a huge success with each episode having a regular viewing audience of more than 50 million.

=== Further works and retirement (1985–1997) ===

In 1985, Kumar played a notable supporting role in B. R. Chopra&#x27;s drama film &quot;Tawaif&quot;. The film opened to positive response from reviewers and emerged a major commercial success. In 1986, he played the title role in B. R. Chopra&#x27;s acclaimed and successful television show &quot;Bahadur Shah Zafar&quot;. The following year, he appeared in Shekhar Kapoor&#x27;s superhero film &quot;Mr. India&quot;, which was a major critical and commercial success, followed by two more hits films, &quot;Watan Ke Rakhwale&quot; and &quot;Jawab Hum Denge&quot;. Towards the end of decade, Kumar&#x27;s workload slowed due to declining health. His major releases in 1988 and 1989 - &quot;Inteqam&quot; and &quot;Clerk&quot;, respectively, were critical and commercial failures.

In the early-1990s, he appeared in films, such as &quot;Majboor&quot; (1990), &quot;Begunaah&quot; (1991), &quot;Humlaa&quot; (1992) and &quot;Aasoo Bane Angaarey&quot; (1993), but they did not succeed at the box office. During this period, success came with the TV shows &quot;Bheem-Bhavani&quot; (1990) and &quot;Tehkikaat&quot; (1994). Kumar received Lifetime Achievement Award at the 41st Filmfare Awards, which was held in the year 1996. The same year, he reunited with Dev Anand and Dharmendra for &quot;Return of Jewel Thief&quot;, which was highly anticipated before release, but ended up as a loss making venture. Kumar quit acting after making an appearance in Ashim Samanta&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Ankhon Mein Tum Ho&quot; (1997) starring Sharad Kapoor, Suman Ranganathan and Rohit Roy. The film opened to negative reviews from critics and was a box office flop.

<text>Otto Braun (28 January 1872 – 15 December 1955) was a politician of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) during the Weimar Republic. From 1920 to 1932, with only two brief interruptions, Braun was Minister President of the Free State of Prussia. The continuity of personnel in high office resulted in a largely stable government in Prussia, in contrast to the sometimes turbulent politics of the Reich. During his term of office, Prussia&#x27;s public administration was reorganized along democratic lines. He replaced many monarchist officials with supporters of the Weimar Republic, strengthened and democratized the Prussian police, and made attempts to fight the rise of the Nazi Party.

On 20 July 1932, in the Prussian coup d&#x27;état (), Reich Chancellor Franz von Papen ousted Braun&#x27;s government from power following its loss of a parliamentary majority to the Nazis and the Communist Party of Germany. After Adolf Hitler seized power at the end of January 1933, Prussia lost its democratic constitution and Braun went into exile. After World War II, he had little or no political influence and was largely forgotten by the time he died in 1955.

== Life and character ==

Braun was born in Königsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia), the capital and largest city of East Prussia. His father was originally a self-employed master shoemaker who ended his working life as a railroad lineman, a position then considered considerably lower socially. After a short period of schooling, Otto completed an apprenticeship as a lithographer. 

Little information survives about his wife Emilie, née Podzius, who was one year older than Braun. He met her in the 1890s at a party function where he spoke, and they were married on 3 April 1894. During Braun&#x27;s time as Minister President, Emilie never appeared in public. After she became terminally ill in 1927, the couple&#x27;s life was largely confined to the house. According to eyewitness accounts, Braun cared for his wife devotedly; his flight to Switzerland in 1933 appears to have been primarily out of concern for her. Their only child, Erich, died of diphtheria in 1915 at the age of 21 as a volunteer in World War I. It was a loss that affected Braun deeply.

He was an impressive figure: almost 1.9 meters tall (6 ft. 2 in.), broadly built, strong-willed, with a marked organizational talent and an ability to lead even complex groups. He thought and acted in a matter-of-fact, sober manner but lacked both rhetorical skill and the ability to excite his listeners with a rousing speech. Although he was often described to the outside world as a &quot;Prussian iceberg&quot;, his political pragmatism was always guided by a deep humanist conviction of people&#x27;s right to freedom and political equality. 

== In the SPD ==
In 1888, at the age of 16, Braun became involved with the SPD, which had been banned under the Anti-Socialist Laws of German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. Influenced by anarcho-syndicalism – a view that revolutionary industrial unionism or syndicalism was a way for workers to gain control of a capitalist economy – he initially belonged to the party&#x27;s left wing. He was chairman of the Königsberg Workers&#x27; Election Association, the local party&#x27;s legal front, and later producer, editor and printer of various Social Democratic periodicals. In a region where several attempts by the SPD to establish a party newspaper had failed, Braun successfully founded the , later the , with no start-up capital, minimal support from party leadership and under difficult sales conditions in a rural area dominated by large-scale agriculture.

During the period he was particularly involved with the agricultural workers of East Prussia, and as a result he became an expert on agricultural policy within the SPD as well as a lifelong opponent of the landed Junkers of East Elbia, the area of Germany to the east of the Elbe river. In a later work, (&#x27;The East Elbian Rural Proletariat&#x27;), he wrote in his unwieldy prose:The exploited, disenfranchised East Elbian rural population is the pedestal on which the preponderant share of the power of the East Elbian Junkers rests and, propped on it, drives the policies of robbery that starve and disenfranchise the people. But the more the pedestal succeeds in spreading Social Democratic principles among the population groups that form it, the more rotten it must become.Braun was also co-founder of the German Agricultural Workers&#x27; Union, chairman of the local health insurance fund and a member of the Königsberg City Council.

In 1892 Braun received a two month prison sentence for lèse-majesté. In November 1903 prosecutors accused him of exporting anarchist writings to Russia that called for the overthrow of Tsar Nicholas II. He was arrested, and in 1904 proceedings were instituted against him and eight other Social Democrats for high treason. Braun spent over five months in pretrial detention awaiting what came to be known as the &quot;Königsberg secret society trial&quot;. Braun was defended by fellow East Prussian Social Democrat Hugo Haase, who in the process revealed the cooperation of the Prussian police with the Russian secret service Okhrana. The evidence against Braun was not considered substantive by the court, and he was acquitted.

In 1898 Braun became chairman of the East Prussian SPD and in 1905 assumed his first party office at the Reich level as a member of the Control Commission. In 1911 he moved up to the Reich Executive Committee of the SPD as chief treasurer where he remained until 1917. In 1913 he won a seat in the Prussian House of Representatives which he kept until 1933. Although he initially belonged to the left wing of the party, as an autodidact he was very different from the often highly educated Spartacists and Communists. He found their argumentation too unworldly, too theoretical and too little oriented toward practical and attainable goals. He once criticized Rosa Luxemburg for her &quot;insufferable schoolmasterly manner&quot;. In 1895, commenting on discussions in the party about an agrarian program, he said that &quot;for practical agitation the draft offers nothing. There, as in the whole debate, they argued doctoral questions.&quot; After the party rejected the draft, he said, &quot;So let us leave our program, which has already helped us over many a mountain and led to many a victory, completely untouched for the time being, and let us not tinker around with it so much; that can lead to no good results. But it is different with our tactics, which on the basis of our program have to adapt naturally to the respective conditions in all locations.&quot; 

During World War I, Braun sided with the SPD&#x27;s more moderate wing that supported the Reichstag&#x27;s &quot;Burgfriedenspolitik&quot;, which was intended to prevent domestic political disputes during the war. When the left wing of the SPD split off in 1917 to form the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD), Braun stayed with the majority in the MSPD. He participated in the organization of the strike of January 1918, in which 400,000 workers, primarily in munitions plants, unsuccessfully went on strike. At the end of the war and the start of the German Revolution of 1918–1919, he became a representative of the MSPD on the Berlin Workers&#x27; and Soldiers&#x27; Council, which was set up on the pattern of Russian soviets. With Braun&#x27;s concern about reliability and organizational efficiency, he was not happy in the council. Its majorities often changed, its composition was highly dependent on chance, and the discussions frequently did not revolve around practical issues but got lost in ideological debates about principles. Because of his experience with it he retained a lifelong aversion to &quot;the wretchedness () of councils&quot;.

In 1919 and 1920 Braun was a member of the Weimar National Assembly, which was both the new Republic&#x27;s interim parliament and the body that drafted and adopted the Weimar Constitution. From 1920 to 1933, he was a member of the German Reichstag. Due to conflicts of interest between the Reich and Prussia and because of Braun&#x27;s often hands-on and unconventional manner, he and the SPD&#x27;s party leadership became estranged even though both the national and the Prussian parliaments were often governed by what came to be called the Weimar Coalition made up of the SPD, the center-left German Democratic Party (DDP) and the center-right Catholic Centre Party. While as a pragmatist Braun focused his actions primarily on the interests of the coalition in Prussia and thus on the stability of the government, the SPD&#x27;s own interests took precedence for the leadership of both the party and the Reichstag parliamentary group. Especially after the Majority Democratic Party and the USPD reunited in September 1922, conflicts often arose over the proper political course. Personal rivalries, especially between Braun and SPD party chairman Otto Wels, continued to worsen the climate and communications. Braun accused the SPD leadership of acting irresponsibly, and Wels thought that Braun&#x27;s behavior toward the party was reckless and that he lacked respect for Social Democratic principles.

== In the Prussian government ==
In 1918, after the fall of the monarchy, Braun became Prussia&#x27;s Minister of Agriculture under Minister President Paul Hirsch. He opposed the breakup of Prussia that many were proposing following the war. In contrast to the ultra-conservative government of Bavaria which was referred to as an (&#x27;cell of order&#x27;), he saw Prussia as Germany&#x27;s democratic . He also feared that the dissolution of Prussia, which covered about two-thirds of Germany in area but was very inhomogeneous in composition, would strengthen the annexation demands of the victorious powers.

As Minister of Agriculture he attempted an agrarian reform designed primarily to strip the great landowners east of the Elbe of their power. The centerpiece of his idea was a policy that would settle former soldiers on fallow lands. The soldiers would have obtained civilian employment, and at the same time the strained food situation in Germany would have improved. Fierce resistance from large-scale agriculturalists, Hirsch&#x27;s hesitant stance and the fact that Braun&#x27;s plans ran counter to law caused them for the most part to fail. 

When the Allied demands in the Treaty of Versailles became known on 7 May 1919, the outrage of the public and the political leadership was fierce. On 21 May 1919 Braun said in Lyck, East Prussia:Never in the history of the world has such a shameless fraud been perpetrated on a people as this. ... The Prussian State Government and the Reich Government, in agreement with the entirety of the people&#x27;s representatives, have taken the stand that the treaty is calculated to lead the German people into permanent slavery, and that it is therefore completely unacceptable to us and must not be signed. 

=== Minister President ===
Braun was Prussian Minister President from March 1920 to March 1921, November 1921 to January 1925, and April 1925 to May 1932. Ironically, he became Minister President only because he seemed more dangerous to his opponents in the SPD as Minister of Agriculture, and they lobbied the other coalition parties to make him Minister President. He thus became the most powerful man in what was by far the largest and most populous state in the Weimar Republic.

Among the numerous problems Braun had to deal with were disputes with the large landowners and the nationalist-conservative German National People&#x27;s Party (DNVP) that was allied with them; tensions over border and minority issues with Poland and the Polish minority in Prussia; and the 1923–1925 occupation of the Ruhr (which was part of Prussia) by troops from France and Belgium. His office was made more difficult by a conflict with Cologne Mayor Konrad Adenauer, chairman of the Prussian provincial council, over the status of the Rhine Province as part of the Prussian state. In addition, there was a clash with the House of Hohenzollern over their family property which led to the failed referendum on the expropriation of the princes in 1926. Within the coalition, the Centre Party was the critical partner. During most of the period, it could have broken with the SDP and formed a right-wing coalition with the DNVP and the German People&#x27;s Party (DVP), as it did several times at the Reich level.

=== Prussia as a &quot;democratic bulwark&quot; ===
Braun pursued ambitious policies amid the tense political environment. His greatest advantages over national politics were the favorable election results – the Weimar Coalition of SPD, Centre and DDP always retained a narrow majority in the Prussian House of Representatives – and the fact that under the Prussian constitution, the Minister President was elected by Parliament, which meant that unlike the German Chancellor, he could usually rely on a parliamentary majority. Ernst Heilmann (SPD) and Joseph Heß (Centre) made significant contributions to the cohesion of their respective parties in the government. Braun&#x27;s most important allies were the state&#x27;s two Social Democratic Interior Ministers, Carl Severing (1920–1926 and 1930–1932) and Albert Grzesinski (1927–1929). 

The main points of conflict within the coalition were school policy and disputes over the appointment of civil servants. While the Centre Party favored church-based denominational schools, the SPD and the DDP wanted state schools independent of religion. When it came to appointing civil servants, there were differences over whether it should be done based primarily on political-democratic considerations or on professional expertise, which, due to the recruitment of junior civil servants under the German Empire until 1919, resulted in a preponderance of conservative civil servants who were hostile to the Republic. Finally, the Centre and DDP frequently criticized Prussia&#x27;s agricultural policy, which they thought was &quot;full of socialist experiments&quot;.

Because of his authoritarian style of governing, Braun was sometimes referred to as the &quot;Tsar of Prussia&quot;, but Prussia itself was considered a democratic stronghold under his leadership. German Chancellor Gustav Stresemann (DVP) described Prussia during the crises of 1923 as the &quot;bulwark of German republicans&quot;. The historian Hajo Holborn wrote that Braun was not a social revolutionary but &quot;a determined democratic reformer&quot; and a shrewd coalition builder.

=== Reform policies ===

During Braun&#x27;s term in office, land reform and a democratic reform of the school system were partially successful. Appointment of democrats to the civil service and especially the police force was one of the most important goals of Braun&#x27;s government. Particularly after the failed 1920 Kapp Putsch, the Prussian government, unlike other German states, consistently took disciplinary measures against disloyal civil servants. Interior Minister Grzesinski summarized the government&#x27;s program on the occasion of his inauguration late in 1926:

* fight enemies of the Republic
* consolidate state power, especially through the expansion of the police
* remove reactionary leading officials in the state administration and replace them with committed supporters of the Weimar Constitution, including from the broad strata of the people
* eliminate the still-existing privileges of the nobility in Prussia through the abolition of manor districts
* initiate and implement state and municipal administrative reform

Braun and Severing had replaced almost all Prussian governors (), district presidents (), district administrators and police chiefs. After its reorganization by Wilhelm Abegg, the Prussian police force was considered one of the most important guarantors of the Weimar Republic. In the end, it was about 50,000 strong, predominantly republican-minded, and part of it trained paramilitarily. It also knew how to respond effectively during the periods of street fighting that became frequent in the late 1920s and early 1930s.

Since there were few supporters of democracy who already had civil service training or extensive experience in office, the restaffing could only be partially carried out. Especially below the immediate leadership level, the government had to leave many officials loyal to the monarchy in office. Conservative and bourgeois parties in particular strongly opposed political reassignments, although both the DDP and the DVP were awarded an above-average number of posts in the administration&#x27;s governing bodies. The reintegration of the DVP into the Prussian government failed several times mainly due to this issue.

=== 1925 presidential election ===

In the 1925 German presidential election, Braun campaigned to succeed Friedrich Ebert as President of the Reich, running against the Centre Party&#x27;s Wilhelm Marx, Karl Jarres of the DVP and Ernst Thälmann of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). The Social Democrats were counting on a leadership figure known throughout Germany who was similar to Ebert in mentality. In the first round of voting, Braun received 29 percent of the vote, a considerably better result than the SPD&#x27;s 20.5% in the previous Reichstag election. Because the Centre Party refused to support a Social Democratic candidate on the second ballot, Braun withdrew in favor of Marx. He was no more successful than Braun in appealing to conservative voters and lost to Paul von Hindenburg. 

=== End of the Weimar Republic ===
Braun initially had a good relationship with President Hindenburg, something that was surprising both to observers and to the two men themselves. The Minister President, who topped the tall field marshal by a hand&#x27;s breadth, was also one of the few men who symbolically met Hindenburg eye to eye. The two found common conversational grounds in their mutual passion for hunting in East Prussia. Hindenburg viewed Braun as a politician who thought not so much in terms of ideological subtleties but instead, within certain basic convictions, was open and pragmatically oriented toward day-to-day politics. After their first meeting, Hindenburg said, &quot;My friends … had told me that Otto Braun was a fanatical rabble-rouser. Now I see that he is a quite reasonable person with whom one can talk about everything.&quot;

Over the long term, however, Braun was unable to hold out against Hindenburg&#x27;s inner circle. The trust between the two men was lost for good in October 1929 after Braun banned the Rhineland chapter of Der Stahlhelm, a veteran&#x27;s organization that served as the paramilitary body of the right-wing DNVP. The ban left Hindenburg, an honorary member of the association who took Braun&#x27;s action personally, ready to back drastic action against him and the Prussian government.

In the final phase of the Weimar Republic, Braun tried to take action against the rising Nazi Party (NSDAP). In addition to banning the Rhineland Stahlhelm, he worked with the Prussian police and Interior Ministers Albert Grzesinski and then Carl Severing to enforce a nationwide ban on the Sturmabteilung (SA), the Nazi Party&#x27;s paramilitary wing. The (state security) worked comparatively purposefully and successfully against the NSDAP, but both its powers and options were limited. After the failure in March 1930 of the grand coalition led by Hermann Müller (SPD) in the German Parliament, the SPD in the Reichstag for the most part supported the government of Heinrich Brüning (Centre), primarily so that the Centre Party in Prussia would continue to support Braun, and the Prussian police could therefore remain under the command of democrats. 

Braun&#x27;s majority in the Prussian Parliament had slowly dwindled, especially since the opponents of the Republic had been able to cooperate to work against the government. In 1930 the DNVP and Communists (KPD) introduced a joint motion of no confidence, and in 1931 the Stahlhelm, with the support of the NSDAP, DNVP, DVP and KPD, attempted to pass a popular referendum to remove the government in Prussia. Both measures failed.

=== Removal from office ===
In the election of 24 April 1932, the Weimar coalition for the first time fell short of a majority in a Prussian state election. Under the Prussian constitution, an incumbent government could not be deposed unless a prospective successor already commanded a majority. That measure, the constructive vote of no confidence, was intended to ensure that a government had sufficient support to govern. In 1932 neither the Communists nor the National Socialists would support the governing coalition, but neither of them could muster sufficient support to form a government in their own right, and they would not consider working with each other. As a result, Braun and his cabinet, after formally submitting their resignations, remained in office on a caretaker basis in accordance with Article 59 of the state constitution.

After the strains of the election campaign, Braun had a physical breakdown on the night of April 22–23. When it became clear that his government would remain in office, he turned the handling of day-to-day affairs over to Heinrich Hirtsiefer, the Centre Party Minister of Public Welfare, and withdrew to rest and recuperate.

In an attempt to break the parliamentary stalemate and remove the Braun government from office, Reich Chancellor Franz von Papen, with the approval of President Hindenburg, initiated the 1932 Prussian coup d&#x27;état on 20 July. It replaced Prussia&#x27;s legal government with von Papen as Reich Commissioner and gave executive power to the Reich Minister of the Armed Forces Kurt von Schleicher. Braun remained in Berlin and prepared a legal complaint to the State Constitutional Court () of the Reichsgericht (Reich Court of Justice) on behalf of the Prussian state government.

In the SPD&#x27;s poor election results and Braun&#x27;s ill health, Papen had found an opportunity to eliminate the most important power centre of the republican parties in Germany. The immediate pretext was provided by the Altona Bloody Sunday, a clash in Altona (near Hamburg) between the Nazi SA, Communists and the police that left 18 dead. It provided the rationale for a &quot;Reichsexekution&quot;, a constitutionally sanctioned intervention by the federal government against a member state, to be presented as a necessary step toward restoring peace and order. Although Braun officially remained Minister President, his powers were transferred to Papen as &quot;Reichskommissar&quot;.

On 25 July the State Constitutional Court refused to issue an injunction against Hindenburg&#x27;s &quot;Emergency Decree concerning the restoration of public safety and order in the territory of Prussia&quot;. Braun then spent the summer on a recuperative vacation in Bad Gastein, Austria and Ascona in Switzerland. In mid-October, he was back in Berlin, and on 25 October the State Court ruled in &quot;Prussia versus the Reich&quot; that the measures taken by Papen and Hindenburg had not been lawful, but that the result had to be accepted. Braun&#x27;s government continued to retain its constitutional rights with respect to the Prussian Landtag, the Reichsrat – the upper house of the German Parliament that represented the interest of the states – and the Reich government. Talks with Papen and Hindenburg on 29 October brought no progress. Braun was legally still Minister President of Prussia, but his only power lay in presiding over meaningless meetings of his cabinet, now called a &quot;sovereign government&quot; (), and in representing Prussia in the Reichsrat, while Reich Commissioner Papen was rapidly erasing the reforms of the previous twelve years. The appointment of Kurt von Schleicher as Reichskommissar brought no significant changes. It was not until Adolf Hitler seized power in 1933 that Hermann Göring, with Papen&#x27;s help, secured a new emergency decree from Hindenburg that officially deposed Braun&#x27;s &quot;sovereign government&quot;. His response was again limited to filing a complaint with the State Constitutional Court on 7 February 1933. 

The events following the 27 February 1933 Reichstag fire and warnings that his life was threatened induced Braun to flee Germany. On 4 March he set off by car across the border to Austria. The SPD party leadership did not forgive him for his flight, which became known before the polling stations closed for the March 5 election for the Prussian Parliament and the German Reichstag. It seemed to them to be a desertion, with perhaps disastrous consequences for the election results and a demoralizing effect on the defenders of the Republic. There was practically no contact between Braun and the party leadership in exile, the Sopade.

Afterwards, Braun was often reproached for surrendering without a fight and not calling a general strike or attempting to regain his powers with the help of the Prussian uniformed police, which at the time numbered 50,000 men. Braun&#x27;s behavior during the Prussian coup d&#x27;état in particular symbolized the helplessness of the democratic forces in the face of an enemy that felt bound neither by order nor by existing law. He considered a more active approach futile in view of the political-military balance of power in 1932. In his opinion, it would only have caused unnecessary bloodshed.

== In exile ==
After Braun had been warned by men close to the Reich President of a wave of arrests, he fled to Ascona in Switzerland, which he already knew as a vacation spot. In Switzerland, he was forbidden any political activity as well as gainful employment. He had been able to save most of his assets, but, confident that he would be paid his pension as Prussian Minister President, he had spent it on a plot of land with a house and even taken out a mortgage. After it became clear that he would have to get by with almost no money, Braun in depression withdrew into gardening and thus the nature he loved. He wrote in a letter that he was brooding over the &quot;whole misery of my wretched existence&quot; and that he was asking himself, &quot;How am I, as a 62-year-old worn out man whose freedom of movement is severely hampered by my paralyzed wife, supposed to create a new existence for myself under today&#x27;s conditions?&quot; Although it seemed implausible to the Gestapo that the &quot;Red Tsar of Prussia&quot; was content to grow potatoes in exile, they found no convincing evidence to the contrary.

In the summer of 1937, a lawyer attempted to collect five hundred marks in debt from Braun. He tried unsuccessfully to rent or sell his house, but fearing the bailiff, he finally left Switzerland. In Paris, he had his first close contact with the SPD in exile and showed a constant manic compulsion to justify himself. His friends were able to persuade him to write his memoirs. Braun buried himself in documents, and by 1938 the manuscript for (&#x27;From Weimar to Hitler&#x27;) was completed. His political testament appeared in 1940, greatly abridged because of Swiss censorship. 

He was at that point able to rent out his house in Ascona at a good price. It allowed him to move back to Switzerland and live there, relieved of at least the worst of his financial worries until the outbreak of the war. Then things went downhill again; no tenant could be found so Braun had to move back into his house without any income. His book did not bring in enough to even pay the mortgage interest on his house. In the summer of 1941, he sold his watch and &quot;other expendable things that could be turned into money&quot;. He spent much of the time in bed suffering from attacks of rheumatism. To his closest confidant Herbert Weichmann, he wrote, &quot;when many weeks I wander from table to table like a beggar student, I can hardly help feeling depressed&quot;.

It was the former Reichstag member Heinrich Georg Ritzel who brought Braun back into social and political life. He established contact with the Bavarian Social Democrat Wilhelm Hoegner and the former Reich Chancellor Joseph Wirth. Together they drew up plans for a possible postwar order, but Braun&#x27;s attempt to have the Allies reinstate the previous democratic Prussian government failed because they had decided to abolish Prussia. Ritzel arranged modest financial support from the Swiss Workers&#x27; Relief Agency so that Braun at least no longer had to beg.

== Post-war ==
Although he had been one of the most powerful men of the Weimar Republic, Braun largely disappeared from public memory after World War II. His ideas about post-war politics failed to attract interest. Neither his political views nor what he symbolized fit into the changed situation in Germany. The old Free State of Prussia was divided between the Federal Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic, Poland and the Soviet Union, and the idea of a genuinely democratic and republican socialism increasingly contradicted both the West&#x27;s and the East&#x27;s Cold War political ideas. In the Soviet Occupation Zone and later East Germany, both as a Social Democrat and as a Prussian, he was too close to what was called revanchism to be appreciated. In West Germany, Konrad Adenauer, Braun&#x27;s longtime domestic political adversary and a staunch opponent of both Prussianism and socialism, dominated the government for many years. In addition, Braun&#x27;s commitment to the Weimar Republic was long overshadowed by his ultimate political failure and general passivity during the Prussian coup d&#x27;état. Otto Braun died in Locarno, Switzerland on 15 December 1955. 

It was not until the 1970s that historians began to take an interest in Otto Braun again. Hagen Schulze wrote a comprehensive biography of him in 1977 (see Further Reading).

== Legacy ==

In 1995 the Hans-Beimler-Straße (Hans Beimler Street) in former East Berlin was renamed the Otto-Braun-Straße by the Berlin Government.

<doc id="335014" wikidata="Q2916659" url="?curid=335014" title="Operation Dani">
<text>Operation Dani, also spelled Danny, was an Israeli military offensive launched on July 9–19, 1948 at the end of the first truce of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. The objectives were to capture territory east of Tel Aviv and then to push inland and relieve the Jewish population and forces in Jerusalem. The main forces fighting against the IDF were the Arab Legion and Palestinian irregulars

On 10 July, Glubb Pasha ordered the defending Arab Legion troops to &quot;make arrangements ... for a phony war&quot;.

The operation commander was Yigal Allon and his deputy was Yitzhak Rabin. The total force numbered around 6,000 soldiers.

==Name==
The operation was named after Palmach officer Daniel &quot;Dani&quot; Mass, who had fallen on January 16, 1948, while commanding a relief action known as &quot;Convoy of 35&quot;.

==Objectives==
The first phase of Operation Dani was to capture the cities of Lydda and Ramle, located on the road to Jerusalem, southeast of Tel Aviv. Ramle was one of the main obstacles blocking Jewish transportation. From the start of the war, Lydda and Ramle militiamen had attacked Jewish traffic on nearby roads. Ramle became a focal point for blocking Jewish transportation, forcing traffic from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv to a southern bypass.

The second phase was to capture the fort at Latrun and break through Ramallah. The operation was carried out under Palmach command using the Yiftach Brigade, the Harel Brigade, the 8th Armored Brigade and two battalions from the Kiryati and Alexandroni brigades.

==Lydda and Ramle==


On 9 July units from the Yiftach Brigade began approaching Ramle from the south. At the same time troops from the other brigades began attacking villages north of Lydda. Caught in a pincer movement and with only a token Arab Legion presence the two towns were captured the following day. This put Lydda airport and the strategic railway station at Ramle in Israeli hands.

As part of the 1948 Palestinian expulsions, Israeli forces violently expelled 50,000-70,000 people from Lydda and Ramle, killing hundreds.

==Latrun==


The second phase of the operation failed after several costly attacks on Arab Legion positions in the Battle of Latrun and the threat of a UN-imposed cease-fire.

==Casualties==
The Palmach record the names of ninety-one of its members killed during this Operation. Forty-four were killed at Khirbet Kurikur on 18 July 1948. Seven were killed in the capture of Lydda.

==Palestinian Arab communities captured==
==Units==

<doc id="335017" wikidata="Q132616" url="?curid=335017" title="Naomi Watts">
<text>Naomi Ellen Watts (born 28 September 1968) is a British actress. After her family moved to Australia, she made her film debut there in the drama &quot;For Love Alone&quot; (1986). She appeared in three television series, &quot;Hey Dad..!&quot; (1990), &quot;Brides of Christ&quot; (1991), and &quot;Home and Away&quot; (1991), and the film &quot;Flirting&quot; (1991). Ten years later, Watts moved to the United States, where she initially struggled as an actress. She took roles in small-scale films until she starred in her breakthrough role as an aspiring actress in David Lynch&#x27;s mystery film, &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;, in 2001.

Watts played a tormented journalist in the horror remake &quot;The Ring&quot; (2002). She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance as a grief-stricken mother in Alejandro González Iñárritu&#x27;s film &quot;21 Grams&quot; (2003). She had starring roles in &quot;I Heart Huckabees&quot; (2004), &quot;King Kong&quot; (2005), &quot;Eastern Promises&quot; (2007), and &quot;The International&quot; (2009). For her role as Maria Bennett in the disaster film &quot;The Impossible&quot; (2012), Watts received a second nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. She has since starred in &quot;Birdman&quot; (2014), &quot;St. Vincent&quot; (2014), &quot;While We&#x27;re Young&quot; (2015), &quot;The Glass Castle&quot; (2017), and &quot;Luce&quot; (2019), and appeared in the &quot;Divergent&quot; franchise (2015–2016).

Watts ventured into television with the third season of Lynch&#x27;s mystery series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (2017) and the biographical miniseries &quot;The Loudest Voice&quot; (2019). She then starred in the Netflix thriller series &quot;The Watcher&quot; (2022), and portrayed Babe Paley in the anthology series &quot;&quot; (2024), for which she received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination.

Watts is particularly known for her work in remakes and independent productions with dark or tragic themes, as well as for portrayals of characters who endure loss or suffering. Magazines such as &quot;People&quot; and &quot;Maxim&quot; have included her on their lists of the world&#x27;s most beautiful women. She has served as an ambassador for the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and Pantene&#x27;s Beautiful Lengths. From 2005 to 2016, she was in a relationship with American actor Liev Schreiber, with whom she has two children. In June 2023, she married American actor Billy Crudup.

==Early life and education ==
Naomi Ellen Watts was born on 28 September 1968, in Shoreham, Kent, England. She is the daughter of Myfanwy (Miv) Edwards (née Roberts), an antiques dealer and costume and set designer, and Peter Watts (1946–1976), a road manager and audio engineer who worked with Pink Floyd. Watts&#x27;s maternal grandfather was Welsh. Watts&#x27;s parents divorced when she was four years old. After the divorce, their mother moved several times with Watts and her older brother Ben within South East England. Their father Peter Watts left Pink Floyd in 1974 and remarried in 1976. In August 1976, when Watts was nearly eight years old, he was found dead in a flat in Notting Hill, London, of an apparent heroin overdose. Following his death, Watts&#x27;s mother moved the family to Llanfawr Farm in Llangefni and Llanfairpwllgwyngyll, towns on the island of Anglesey in North Wales, to live with her parents, Nikki and Hugh Roberts. During this period of three years, Watts attended a Welsh medium school, Ysgol Gyfun Llangefni.

She later said of her time in Wales: &quot;We took Welsh lessons in a school in the middle of nowhere while everyone else was taking English. Wherever we moved, I would adapt and pick up the regional accent. It&#x27;s obviously significant now, me being an actress. Anyway, there was quite a lot of sadness in my childhood, but no lack of love.&quot; In 1978, her mother remarried and moved with her children to Suffolk. (She and her second husband later divorced.) There Watts attended Thomas Mills High School. Watts has said that she wanted to become an actress after seeing her mother performing on stage and from the time she watched the 1980 film &quot;Fame&quot;. In 1982, when Watts was 14, the family moved to Sydney, Australia. Her mother Myfanwy established a career in the burgeoning film business, first working as a stylist for television commercials. She turned to costume design, and worked for the soap opera &quot;Return to Eden&quot;. Watts briefly cameoed as a model in two episodes. Watts was enrolled by her mother in acting lessons in Sydney. She auditioned for numerous television advertisements, where she met and befriended the young actress Nicole Kidman. In Australia, Watts attended Mosman High School and North Sydney Girls High School. She did not graduate from school. After leaving school she worked as a papergirl, a negative cutter, and managed a Delicacies store in Sydney&#x27;s affluent North Shore.

At the age of 18, Watts decided to become a model. She signed with a models agency that sent her to Japan, but after several failed auditions, she returned to Sydney. She began to work in advertising for a department store. &quot;Follow Me&quot; magazine hired her as an assistant fashion editor. A casual invitation to participate in a drama workshop inspired Watts to quit her job and pursue acting. Despite her years in Australia, Watts considers herself firmly British in regards to her nationality. She has said that: &quot;I consider myself British and have very happy memories of the UK. I spent the first 14 years of my life in England and Wales and never wanted to leave. When I was in Australia I went back to England a lot.&quot;

==Career==
===Early roles and struggling career (1986–2000)===
Watts&#x27;s career began in television, where she made brief appearances in commercials. She made her film debut in &quot;For Love Alone&quot; (1986). It was set in the 1930s and based on Christina Stead&#x27;s 1945 best-selling novel of the same name. In 1990 she appeared in two episodes of the fourth season of the Australian sitcom &quot;Hey Dad..!&quot;. At the 1989 premiere of her friend Nicole Kidman&#x27;s film &quot;Dead Calm&quot;, Watts met John Duigan, who invited her to take a supporting role in his 1991 indie film &quot;Flirting&quot;. The film received critical acclaim and was featured on American critic Roger Ebert&#x27;s list of the 10 best films of 1992. Also in 1991, she took the part of Frances Heffernan, a girl who struggles to find friends at a Catholic school in Sydney, in the mini-series &quot;Brides of Christ&quot;. She also had a recurring role in the soap opera &quot;Home and Away&quot; as the handicapped Julie Gibson. Watts was offered a role in the drama series &quot;A Country Practice&quot; but turned it down, not wanting to &quot;get stuck on a soap for two or three years&quot;. She later said that decision was &quot;naïve&quot;.

Watts took a year off to travel, visiting Los Angeles and being introduced to agents through Kidman. Encouraged, Watts decided to move to the United States, to pursue her career further. In 1993, she had a small role in the John Goodman film &quot;Matinee&quot;. She returned to Australia temporarily to star in three Australian films: another of Duigan&#x27;s pictures, &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea&quot;; and the drama &quot;The Custodian&quot;. She had her first leading role in the film &quot;Gross Misconduct&quot;, as a student who accuses one of her teachers (played by Jimmy Smits) of raping her. Watts returned to Los Angeles and the US for good but had difficulty finding agents, producers and directors willing to hire her. She never worked outside the film industry, but had some tight times in which she was unable to pay the rent on time and lost her medical insurance.

After nine auditions, she won a supporting role of &quot;Jet Girl&quot; in the futuristic film &quot;Tank Girl&quot; (1995). The film met mixed reviews and flopped at the box office. It has since become something of a cult classic. Throughout the rest of the decade, Watts took mostly supporting roles in films. Occasionally she considered leaving the business, but: &quot;there were always little bites. Whenever I felt I was at the end of my rope, something would come up. Something bad. But for me it was &#x27;work begets work&#x27;; that was my motto.&quot; In 1996, she starred alongside Joe Mantegna, Kelly Lynch and J. T. Walsh in George Hickenlooper&#x27;s action-thriller &quot;Persons Unknown&quot;; alongside James Earl Jones, Kevin Kilner and Ellen Burstyn in the period drama &quot;Timepiece&quot;; in &quot;Bermuda Triangle&quot;, a TV pilot that was not picked up for a full series, where she played a former documentary filmmaker who disappears in the Bermuda Triangle; She had the lead role in &quot;Children of the Corn IV: The Gathering&quot;, in which children in a small town become possessed under the command of a wrongfully murdered child preacher.

In 1997, she starred in the Australian ensemble romantic drama &quot;Under the Lighthouse Dancing&quot; starring Jack Thompson and Jacqueline McKenzie. She also played the lead role in the short-lived television series &quot;Sleepwalkers&quot;. In 1998, she starred alongside Neil Patrick Harris and Debbie Reynolds in the TV film &quot;The Christmas Wish&quot;, played the supporting role of Giulia De Lezze in &quot;Dangerous Beauty&quot;, and provided some voice work for &quot;&quot;. She said in an interview in 2012, &quot;That really should not be on my résumé! I think that was early on in the day, when I was trying to beef up my résumé. I came in and did a couple days&#x27; work of voiceovers and we had to suck on [helium] and then do a little mouse voice. But I was one in a hundred, so I&#x27;m sure you would never be able to identify my voice. I probably couldn&#x27;t either!&quot;

In 1999, she played Alice in the romantic comedy &quot;Strange Planet&quot; and the Texan student Holly Maddux in &quot;The Hunt for the Unicorn Killer&quot;. This was based on the true effort to capture Ira Einhorn, who was charged with Maddux&#x27;s murder. In 2000, while David Lynch was developing the rejected pilot of &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; as a feature film, Watts starred alongside Derek Jacobi, Jack Davenport and Iain Glen in the BBC TV film &quot;The Wyvern Mystery&quot;, an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Sheridan Le Fanu. It was broadcast in March of that year. She had some near misses for roles in her early career: she was considered for significant roles in such films as 1997&#x27;s &quot;The Postman&quot; and &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot;; all eventually went to other actresses.

In 2002 Watts recalled her early career in an interview. She had lost a role she wanted in &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; in 2000. She said, &quot;It is a tough town. I think my spirit has taken a beating. The most painful thing has been the endless auditions. Knowing that you have something to offer, but not being able to show it, is so frustrating. As an unknown, you get treated badly. I auditioned and waited for things I did not have any belief in, but I needed the work and had to accept horrendous pieces of shit.&quot; Watts studied the Meisner Technique. She referred to this again in a 2012 interview. Watts said, &quot;I came to New York and auditioned at least five times for &quot;Meet the Parents&quot;. I think the director liked me but the studio didn&#x27;t. I heard every piece of feedback you could imagine, and in this case, it was &#x27;not sexy enough&#x27;.&quot;

===Rise to prominence (2001–2002)===
In 1999, director David Lynch began casting for his psychological thriller &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;. He interviewed Watts after looking at her headshot, without having seen any of her previous work, and offered her the lead role. Lynch later said about his selection of Watts, &quot;I saw someone that I felt had a tremendous talent, and I saw someone who had a beautiful soul, an intelligence—possibilities for a lot of different roles, so it was a beautiful full package.&quot; Conceived as a pilot for a television series, Lynch shot a large portion of the film in February 1999, planning to keep it open-ended for a potential series. However, the pilot was rejected. Watts recalled thinking at the time, &quot;just my dumb luck, that I&#x27;m in the only David Lynch programme that never sees the light of day.&quot; Lynch filmed an ending for the work in October 2000, turning it into a feature film, which was picked up for distribution. &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;, also starring Laura Harring and Justin Theroux, premiered at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival to high critical acclaim and marked Watts&#x27;s breakthrough. Reviewing her performance, Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated that &quot;Watts&#x27;s face metamorphoses miraculously from fresh-faced beauty to a frenzied, teary scowl of ugliness.&quot;; Emanuel Levy wrote, &quot;... Watts, in a brilliant performance, a young, wide-eyed and grotesquely cheerful blonde, full of high hopes to make it big in Hollywood.&quot; The film and Watts received numerous awards and nominations, including the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress and a nomination for the American Film Institute Award for Best Actress. The surrealist film explored the story of aspiring actress Betty Elms, played by Watts. It sparked controversy over its strong lesbian theme.

Also in 2001, Watts starred in two short films, &quot;Never Date an Actress&quot; and &quot;Ellie Parker&quot;, and the horror film &quot;The Shaft&quot;, director Dick Maas&#x27;s remake of his 1983 film &quot;De Lift&quot;. In 2002, she starred in one of the biggest box office hits of that year, &quot;The Ring&quot;, the English-language remake of the Japanese horror film &quot;Ring&quot;. Directed by Gore Verbinski, the film, which also starred Martin Henderson and Brian Cox, received favourable reviews and grossed around US$129 million domestically (equivalent to US$ million in 2025). Watts portrayed Rachel Keller, a journalist investigating the strange deaths of her niece and other teenagers after they watched a mysterious videotape and received a phone call announcing their deaths in seven days. Her performance was praised by critics, including Paul Clinton of &quot;CNN.com&quot;, who said that she &quot;is excellent in this leading role, which proves that her stellar performance in &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; was not a fluke. She strikes a perfect balance between skepticism and the slow realisation of the truth in regard to the deadly power of the videotape.&quot; In the same year, she also starred in &quot;Rabbits&quot;, a series of short films directed by David Lynch; alongside several other famous British actors in the black comedy &quot;Plots with a View&quot;; and with Tim Daly in &quot;The Outsider&quot;, a western.

===Established actress (2003–2007)===
In 2003, Watts took the part of Julia Cook in Gregor Jordan&#x27;s Australian film &quot;Ned Kelly&quot;, opposite Heath Ledger, Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush. She also starred in the Merchant-Ivory film &quot;Le Divorce&quot;. She portrayed Roxeanne de Persand, a poet who is pregnant and abandoned by her husband Charles-Henri de Persand. Roxeanne and her sister Isabel (played by Kate Hudson) dispute the ownership of a painting by Georges de La Tour with the family of Charles-Henri&#x27;s lover. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a &quot;C&quot; rating and lamented Watts&#x27;s performance: &quot;I&#x27;m disappointed to report that Hudson and Watts have no chemistry as sisters, perhaps because Watts never seems like the expatriate artiste she&#x27;s supposed to be playing&quot;.

Her performance opposite Sean Penn and Benicio del Toro in Alejandro González Iñárritu&#x27;s psychological drama &quot;21 Grams&quot; (2003) earned Watts numerous award nominations, including her first nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress, the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role. In the story, told in a non-linear manner, she portrayed Cristina Peck, a grief-stricken widow living a suburban life after her husband and two children were killed by Jack Jordan (Benicio del Toro). She became involved in a relationship with Paul Rivers (Sean Penn), an academic mathematician who was critically ill. She has said of the nomination, &quot;It&#x27;s far beyond what I ever dreamed for – that would have been too far fetched&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised her: &quot;Because Ms. Watts reinvents herself with each performance, it&#x27;s easy to forget how brilliant she is. She has a boldness that comes from a lack of overemphasis, something actresses sometimes do to keep up with Mr. Penn&quot;. The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote: &quot;Watts is riveting, but she&#x27;s much better in scenes of extreme emotion than in those requiring subtlety.&quot;
In 2004, Watts starred alongside Mark Ruffalo in the independent film &quot;We Don&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot;, based on short stories by Andre Dubus. It explores the crises of two married couples who are friends and struggling in their lives. She reunited with Sean Penn in &quot;The Assassination of Richard Nixon&quot;, playing the wife of the would-be presidential assassin Samuel Byck (Penn). She teamed up with Jude Law and Dustin Hoffman in David O. Russell&#x27;s ensemble comedy &quot;I Heart Huckabees&quot;. She headlined and produced the semi-autobiographical drama &quot;Ellie Parker&quot; (2005), which depicted the struggle of an Australian actress in Hollywood. The film began as a short film that was screened at the Sundance Film Festival in 2001. Over the next four years, it was expanded into a feature-length production. Film critic Roger Ebert praised Watts&#x27;s performance: &quot;The character is played by Watts with courage, fearless observation and a gift for timing that is so uncanny it can make points all by itself.&quot;

Watts starred in the sequel to &quot;The Ring&quot;, &quot;The Ring Two&quot; (2005), which despite a negative critical response, made more than US$161 million worldwide gross (equivalent to US$ million in 2025). In 2005, Watts also headlined the remake of &quot;King Kong&quot; as Ann Darrow. She was the first choice for the role, portrayed by Fay Wray in the original film, and no other actors were considered. In preparation for her role, Watts met with Wray, who was to make a cameo appearance and say the final line of dialogue. Wray died at the age of 96 during pre-production. &quot;King Kong&quot; proved to be Watts&#x27;s most commercially successful film yet. Helmed by director Peter Jackson, who had made &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, the film won high praise and grossed US$550 million worldwide (equivalent to US$ million in 2025). The &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; praised Watts&#x27;s performance: &quot;The third act becomes a star-crossed, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; parable far more operatic and tragic than anything the original filmmakers could have imagined, exquisitely pantomimed by Watts with a poignancy and passion that rates Oscar consideration.&quot; Watts reprised her role as Darrow in the video game adaptation of &quot;King Kong&quot;, for which her voice performance garnered her significant praise. She was nominated for a Spike Video Game Award for Best Performance by a Female. Watts and the game&#x27;s other cast members also won an award for Best Cast. Her other 2005 film release was Marc Forster&#x27;s psychological thriller &quot;Stay&quot;, alongside Ewan McGregor, Ryan Gosling and Bob Hoskins.

At this point in her career, Watts said the following:

In the romantic drama &quot;The Painted Veil&quot; (2006), based on the novel of the same name by Somerset Maugham, Watts played the daughter of a lawyer and his wife. She is under pressure to marry and chooses a physician (Edward Norton) known as a bacteriologist. She is not prepared when her husband goes to Hong Kong, then a British colony, for work and then forces her to mainland China to a region suffering a cholera epidemic. Comparing her portrayal with Greta Garbo&#x27;s in the original movie adapted from the same novel, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote, &quot;Watts makes the role work on her own terms–her Kitty is more desperate, more foolish, more miserable and more driven... and her spiritual journey is greater. Watts also provided the voice of a small role, Suzie Rabbit, in David Lynch&#x27;s psychological thriller &quot;Inland Empire&quot;. In the same year, she was announced as the new face of the jewelers David Yurman and completed a photoshoot that was featured in the 2007 Pirelli Calendar.

In David Cronenberg&#x27;s &quot;Eastern Promises&quot; (2007), Watts portrays a Russian-British midwife, opposite Viggo Mortensen. She delivers the baby of a drug-addicted 14-year old prostitute. In its review, &quot;Slate&quot; magazine observed that she &quot;brings a wounded radiance to the overcurious midwife Anna. Though it&#x27;s a bit of a one-note role, it&#x27;s a note she&#x27;s long specialised in, a kind of flustered moral aggrievement&quot;. &quot;Eastern Promises&quot; grossed US$56 million worldwide, (equivalent to US$ million in 2025). Also that year she was a producer and starred in Michael Haneke&#x27;s &quot;Funny Games&quot; (2007). She played a mother who, with her family, is held hostage by a pair of sociopathic teenagers. It was a remake of Haneke&#x27;s 1997 film of the same name. According to the UK&#x27;s &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, the director said that he agreed to make the film on condition that he be allowed to cast Watts. The film was largely unnoticed by critics and audiences. &quot;Newsweek&quot; said that Watts &quot;hurls herself into her physically demanding role with heroic conviction&quot;.

===Biographical and independent films (2009–2014)===
After a short hiatus from acting following the birth of her two children, Watts returned to acting in 2009, starring alongside Clive Owen in the political action thriller &quot;The International&quot;, in which she played a Manhattan assistant district attorney who partners with an Interpol agent to take down a merchant bank. The production was a moderate commercial success, grossing over US$60 million (equivalent to $ million in 2025) worldwide. She next appeared in the drama &quot;Mother and Child&quot;, portraying the role of a lawyer who never knew her biological mother. &quot;ViewLondon&quot; found her to be &quot;terrific as [her character], delivering a powerful performance that [...] isn&#x27;t afraid to be unsympathetic&quot;. She was nominated for the Best Actress award at the Australian Film Institute Awards and for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female.

Her next film, the Woody Allen-directed dramedy &quot;You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger&quot;, opened at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival, and saw her portray Sally, a woman who has a troubled marriage with author Roy (played by Josh Brolin). It made over US$26 million (equivalent to $ million in 2025). Her portrayal of Valerie Plame in the biographical thriller &quot;Fair Game&quot; followed, and marked the third pairing of Watts with Sean Penn after &quot;21 Grams&quot; and &quot;The Assassination of Richard Nixon&quot;. The film earned Watts a Satellite Award nomination for Best Actress. In 2011, she appeared with Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz in Jim Sheridan&#x27;s psychological horror film &quot;Dream House&quot;, as the neighbour of a murdered family, and with Leonardo DiCaprio in Clint Eastwood&#x27;s biographical drama &quot;J. Edgar&quot;, playing secretary Helen Gandy. While &quot;Dream House&quot; flopped, &quot;J. Edgar&quot; had a more favorable reception.

Watts starred in &quot;The Impossible&quot; (2012), a disaster drama based on the true story of María Belón and her family&#x27;s experience of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami; she played the lead role, with her name changed to Maria Bennett. The film was a critical darling, had the highest-grossing opening weekend for a film in Spain, and made US$180.2 million (equivalent to $ million in 2025) globally. Deborah Young of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; stated that &quot;Watts packs a huge charge of emotion as the battered, ever-weakening Maria whose tears of pain and fear never appear fake or idealised,&quot; while Justin Chang of &quot;Variety&quot; magazine remarked that she &quot;has few equals at conveying physical and emotional extremis, something she again demonstrates in a mostly bedridden role.&quot; Damon Wise of &quot;The Guardian&quot; felt that &quot;Watts is both brave and vulnerable, and her scenes with the young Lucas [...] are among the film&#x27;s best.&quot; Watts earned nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role, in addition to her second nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.

In &quot;Adore&quot; (2013), Watts starred with Robin Wright as two childhood friends who fall in love with each other&#x27;s sons. On the film, critics concluded that Watts and Wright &quot;give it their all, but they can&#x27;t quite make &quot;Adore&quot;&#x27;s trashy, absurd plot believable&quot;. She obtained the FCCA Award for Best Actress in 2014 for her role. The anthology comedy &quot;Movie 43&quot; (2013) featured Watts as a devoted mother, alongside Liev Schreiber. &quot;Movie 43&quot; was universally panned by critics, with Richard Roeper calling it &quot;the &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; of awful&quot;.

In Laurie Collyer&#x27;s independent drama &quot;Sunlight Jr.&quot; (2013), Watts starred with Matt Dillon as a struggling working-class couple. The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, praising Watts and Dillon, wrote in its review for the film that they are &quot;formidable actors at the top of their game here [...] exhibiting a remarkable chemistry&quot;. Watts portrayed the title role in Oliver Hirschbiegel&#x27;s &quot;Diana&quot; (her final film released in 2013), a biographical drama about the last two years of the life of Diana, Princess of Wales. Released amid much controversy given its subject, the film was a critical flop. James Berardinelli found the film to be a &quot;dull, pointless&quot; production and remarked that while Watts did a &quot;decent job encapsulating the look and feel of Diana&quot;, her portrayal was &quot;a two-dimensional recreation&quot;.

Alejandro González Iñárritu&#x27;s dark comedy &quot;Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)&quot; (2014) featured Watts as the actress of a play mounted by a faded Hollywood actor (played by Michael Keaton). The film was the subject of widespread acclaim, and won four awards at the 87th Academy Awards including Best Picture; Watts and the other cast members earned the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Cast in a Motion Picture. Her other two awaiting projects were screened at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival. The dramedy &quot;St. Vincent&quot; starred Watts as a Russian prostitute. She learned the accent by spending time with Russian women in a West Village spa during a six-week period. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported a dividing reaction towards her performance, asserting that her part &quot;put off some critics with its outrageousness&quot;, but &quot;earned plenty of plaudits too&quot;. Watts earned a nomination for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role. In &quot;While We&#x27;re Young&quot;, Watts starred with Ben Stiller as a New York City-based married couple who begin hanging out with a couple in their 20s. That film was an arthouse success and Watts received praise for her on-screen chemistry with Stiller.

===Film and television work (2015–present)===
Watts played rebel leader Evelyn Johnson-Eaton in &quot;Insurgent&quot; (2015), the second film in &quot;The Divergent Series&quot;, which is based on Veronica Roth&#x27;s best-selling young adult novel of the same name. Despite mixed reviews, the film was a commercial success, grossing US$274.5 million worldwide. Watts reprised her role in the series&#x27;s third instalment, &quot;Allegiant&quot;, released on 18 March 2016, to negative reviews and lackluster box office sales.

Watts starred in Gus Van Sant&#x27;s mystery drama &quot;The Sea of Trees&quot;, opposite Matthew McConaughey, as the wife of an American man who attempts suicide in Mount Fuji&#x27;s &quot;Suicide Forest&quot;. The film premiered at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival where it competed for the Palme d&#x27;Or, but was heavily panned by both critics and audiences, who reportedly booed and laughed during its screening. Critic Richard Mowe stated the audience reaction should &quot;give the film&#x27;s creative team pause for reflection about exactly where they went so badly awry.&quot; Justin Chang of &quot;Variety&quot; also criticised the film, but commended Watts&#x27;s performance for being &quot;solidly moving and sometimes awesomely passive-aggressive.&quot; &quot;The Sea of Trees&quot; did not find an audience in theaters.

Like &quot;St. Vincent&quot; and &quot;While We&#x27;re Young&quot; the previous year, Watts starred in two films—&quot;Demolition&quot; and &quot;Three Generations&quot;— which screened at the Toronto International Film Festival, in 2015. In &quot;Demolition&quot;, directed by Jean-Marc Vallée and opposite Jake Gyllenhaal, Watts played a customer service representative and the interest of a grieving investment banker (Gyllenhaal). &quot;The Wrap&quot; felt that she &quot;empathetically captures [her] harried single mom&quot; role as she played &quot;both the wit and the sadness with grace&quot;. In &quot;Three Generations&quot;, directed by Gaby Dellal, she appeared with Susan Sarandon and Elle Fanning as the mother of a young transgender man (Fanning). Pulled from the schedule days before its intended initial release, the film subsequently opened on selected theatres in May 2017.

Watts played Linda, the second wife of heavyweight boxer Chuck Wepner (played by Liev Schreiber) in the biographical sport drama &quot;The Bleeder&quot; (2016), revolving around the life of Wepner and his 1975 fight with Muhammad Ali. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote in its review: &quot;Slightly out of place as the feisty bartender who gives Wepner a second chance at his downest and outest, a spirited Naomi Watts nonetheless gives proceedings her best Amy Adams in &quot;The Fighter&quot;.&quot; She headlined the thriller &quot;Shut In&quot; (also 2016), playing a psychologist isolated with her child in a rural house during a winter storm. The film received largely negative reviews and made US$8 million worldwide.
Watts appeared in &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, a limited event television series and a continuation of the 1990 show of the same name. It was broadcast on Showtime in 2017, to critical acclaim. Watts starred as &quot;a therapist who begins to develop dangerous and intimate relationships with the people in her patients&#x27; lives&quot; in the Netflix drama series &quot;Gypsy&quot; (also 2017), and served as one of its executive producers. While response was mixed, &quot;Gypsy&quot; was cancelled by Netflix after one season. In &quot;The Book of Henry&quot; (2017), Watts portrayed the mother of young genius who plans save the girl next door from abuse. The film polarized critics and audiences, but &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described her as &quot;a plus in any movie&quot; and found her to be &quot;excellent&quot; in the role. In her other 2017 film, &quot;The Glass Castle&quot; opposite Brie Larson, and Woody Harrelson. An adaptation of Jeannette Walls&#x27;s best selling memoir of the same name, Watts played the nonconformist mother of the author.

She played Queen Gertrud in &quot;Ophelia&quot;. In 2019, Watts portrayed Gretchen Carlson in the Showtime miniseries &quot;The Loudest Voice&quot; based on the book &quot;The Loudest Voice in the Room&quot; about Roger Ailes&#x27;s sexual harassment of Carlson. She next starred in the films &quot;Penguin Bloom&quot;, &quot;Boss Level&quot;, and &quot;This Is the Night&quot;. In 2022, Watts played a lead in Netflix&#x27;s &quot;The Watcher&quot; as Nora Brannock alongside Bobby Cannavale, who played Dean Brannock. In 2024, she starred in the anthology series &quot;&quot; as Babe Paley, for which she received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie nomination.

<text>Black Mountain College was a private liberal arts college in Black Mountain, North Carolina. It was founded in 1933 by John Andrew Rice, Theodore Dreier, and several others. The college was ideologically organized around John Dewey&#x27;s educational philosophy, which emphasized holistic learning and the study of art as central to a liberal arts education.

Many of the college&#x27;s faculty and students were or would go on to become highly influential in the arts, including Josef and Anni Albers, Ruth Asawa, John Cage, Robert Creeley, Merce Cunningham, Max Dehn, Elaine de Kooning, Willem de Kooning, Buckminster Fuller, Walter Gropius, Ray Johnson, Franz Kline, Robert Motherwell, Charles Olson, Robert Rauschenberg, M. C. Richards, Dorothea Rockburne, Michael Rumaker, Aaron Siskind and Cy Twombly.

Although it was quite notable during its lifetime, the school closed in 1957 after 24 years due to funding issues; Camp Rockmont for Boys now sits on the campus&#x27; site.

The history and legacy of Black Mountain College are preserved and extended by the Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center, located in downtown Asheville, North Carolina.

== History ==
Black Mountain College was founded in 1933 by John Andrew Rice, Theodore Dreier, Frederick Georgia, and Ralph Lounsbury, who were dismissed as faculty from Rollins College in a seminal academic freedom incident, specifically for refusing to sign a loyalty pledge, for which Rollins was formally censured by the American Association of University Professors. The institution was established to &quot;avoid the pitfalls of autocratic chancellors and trustees and allow for a more flexible curriculum,&quot; and &quot;with the holistic aim &#x27;to educate a student as a person and a citizen.&#x27;&quot; The school was originally funded through a $10,000 gift from &quot;Mac&quot; Forbes, a former Rollins College faculty member, after the founders were unable to raise funds from traditional sources.:7

Black Mountain was experimental in nature and committed to an interdisciplinary approach, prioritizing art-making as a necessary component of education and attracting a faculty and lecturers that included many of America&#x27;s leading visual artists, composers, poets, and designers. During the 1930s and 1940s the school flourished, becoming well known as an incubator for artistic talent. Notable events at the school were common; it was here that the first large-scale geodesic dome was made by faculty member Buckminster Fuller and students, where Merce Cunningham formed his dance company, and where John Cage staged his first musical happening. In the 1950s, the focus of the school shifted to the literary arts under the rectorship of Charles Olson. Olson founded &quot;The Black Mountain Review&quot; in 1954 and, together with his colleague and student Robert Creeley, developed the poetic school of Black Mountain poets.

Additionally, the College was an important incubator for the American avant-garde. Black Mountain proved to be an important precursor to and prototype for many of the alternative colleges of today, ranging from College of the Atlantic, Naropa University, the University of California, Santa Cruz, and Marlboro College to The Evergreen State College, Hampshire College, Shimer College, Prescott College, Goddard College, World College West (1973–1992), and New College of Florida, among others, including Warren Wilson College located just minutes down the road from where Black Mountain College was located. Bennington College, based on the same philosophy, was founded one year before Black Mountain College.

== Structure ==

The school operated using non-hierarchical methodologies that placed students and educators on the same plane. Revolving around 20th-century ideals about the value and importance of balancing education, art, and cooperative labor, students were required to participate in farm work, construction projects, and kitchen duty as part of their holistic education.

The students were involved at all levels of institutional decision-making. They were also left in charge of deciding when they were ready to graduate, which notoriously few ever did. There were no course requirements, official grades (except for transfer purposes), or accredited degrees. Graduates were presented with handcrafted diplomas as purely ceremonial symbols of their achievement.

The liberal arts program offered at Black Mountain was broad, and supplemented by art making as a means of cultivating creative thinking within all fields. While Josef Albers led the school, the only two requirements were a course on materials and form taught by Albers and a course on Plato.

== Sociopolitical context ==
In 1933, the Nazis shut down the Bauhaus in Germany, a similarly progressive arts-based educational institution. Many of the school&#x27;s faculty left Europe for the US, and a number of them settled at Black Mountain, most notably Josef Albers, who was selected to run the art program, and his wife Anni Albers, who taught weaving and textile design.

Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power and the subsequent persecution taking place in Europe led many artists and intellectuals to flee and resettle in the US, populating Black Mountain College with an influx of both students and faculty.

In addition, the college was operating in the South during the period of legal racial segregation at other colleges and universities in the region. While not immune from racial tensions, the student Alma Stone Williams, an African-American woman who enrolled at Black Mountain College in 1944, is considered by some to be the first black student to enroll in an all-white institution of higher education in the South during the Jim Crow era. Notable African-American instructors included Carol Brice and Roland Hayes during the 1945 Summer Music Institute; Percy H. Baker, hired on full-time in 1945; Jacob Lawrence and Gwendolyn Knight during the 1946 Summer Art Institute; and Mark Oakland Fax for the Spring 1946 quarter. The Julius Rosenwald Fund provided African-American teachers&#x27; salaries as well as student scholarships.

== Locations ==
The college originally rented the YMCA Blue Ridge Assembly buildings south of Black Mountain, North Carolina, founded and owned by another progressive educator, Willis D. Weatherford. 

In 1937, it purchased a property across the valley at Lake Eden.:8 This property, developed by E.W. Grove (of the Grove Park Inn and Grove Arcade in Asheville) as a summer resort for residents of his nearby Grovemont neighborhood, included a gate house, dining hall, sleeping lodges, several cottages and other structures.

In May 1941, following the end of their lease at Blue Ridge Assembly, the College moved its operations to Lake Eden, where it remained until its closing in 1957.:8 Over these 16 years, College faculty, staff, and students established a working farm and constructed new buildings, including the iconic Studies Building designed by architect A. Lawrence Kocher, music rehearsal cubicles (Paul Beidler), the Service Building (Lawrence Kocher), the Science Building (Paul Williams, Dan Rice, and Stan Vanderbeek), the Minimum House (designed by students), the Jalowetz House (Lawrence Kocher), and the Quiet House (a memorial to Mark Dreier designed by Alex &quot;Bill&quot; Reed).

The property was later purchased and converted to an ecumenical Christian boys&#x27; residential summer camp (Camp Rockmont). This has been used for years as the site of the Black Mountain Festival, the Lake Eden Arts Festival (LEAF), and Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center&#x27;s {Re}HAPPENING. A number of the original structures are still in use as lodgings or administrative facilities, and two frescoes painted by Jean Charlot remain intact on the site.

== Closing ==
Black Mountain College closed in 1957, eight years after Albers left to direct the first design department at Yale. The college suspended classes by court order due to debts; the school was unable to sustain itself financially given the greatly decreased number of students. In 1962, the school&#x27;s books were finally closed, with all debts covered.

== Legacy ==
The Black Mountain College Museum &amp; Arts Center, founded in 1933, continues the legacy of Black Mountain College through talks, exhibitions, performances, collection and preservation, and an annual fall conference that examines the college&#x27;s history and impact.

The Journal of Black Mountain College Studies is a multidisciplinary open-access digital publication that publishes articles, essays, and creative work related to the school and the individuals associated with it.

Black Mountain College was the subject of the museum exhibition &quot;Leap Before You Look: Black Mountain College 1933–1957,&quot; which opened at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston on October 10, 2015. The show was curated by Helen Molesworth with Ruth Erickson. The show later exhibited at the Hammer Museum from February 21 to May 15, 2016.

Black Mountain College was featured in Nicholas Sparks&#x27; novel, &quot;The Longest Ride&quot; (2013) and the 2015 movie adaptation of the same name.

<doc id="335026" wikidata="Q235313" url="?curid=335026" title="Edna Purviance">
<text>Olga Edna Purviance (; October 21, 1895 – January 13, 1958) was an American actress of the silent film era. She was the leading lady in many of Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s early films and in a span of eight years, she appeared in over 30 films with him.

==Life and career==
===1895–1913: Early life===
Edna Purviance was born on October 21, 1895, in Paradise Valley, Nevada, to English immigrant Louisa Wright Davey and American vintner to the western mining camps Madison (Matt) Gates Purviance. When she was three, the family moved to Lovelock, Nevada, where they assumed ownership of the Singer Hotel. Her parents divorced in 1902, and her mother later married Robert Nurnberger, a German plumber. Growing up, Purviance was a talented pianist.

She left Lovelock in 1913 and moved in with her married sister Bessie while attending business college in San Francisco.

===1914–1927: Film career===

In 1915, Purviance was working as a stenographer in San Francisco when actor and director Charlie Chaplin was working on his second film with Essanay Studios, working out of Niles, California, 28 miles (45 km) southeast of San Francisco, in Southern Alameda County. He was looking for a leading lady for &quot;A Night Out&quot;.

&quot;A Chaplin talent scout recognized potential in a pretty stenographer named Edna Purviance ... spotted sipping coffee at Tate&#x27;s Café on Hill Street in Noe Valley.&quot;

&quot;...Tate&#x27;s Cafe on Hill Street. There she met Carl Strauss, in town scouting for a leading lady for the young Charlie Chaplin.&quot;

Chaplin arranged a meeting with her, but he was concerned that she might be too serious for comedic roles. Purviance still won the role.

Edna Purviance was so closely associated with Chaplin on screen that trade reviewers took exception when she was away. Columnist Julian Johnson, reporting on Chaplin&#x27;s solo performance in &quot;One A.M.&quot;, wrote: &quot;Congratulations, Mr. Chaplin, on speaking your piece so nicely, but—come on back, Edna!&quot; The noticeably close relationship extended to the actors&#x27; private lives: Chaplin and Purviance were romantically involved during the making of his Essanay, Mutual, and First National films of 1915 to 1917. The romance ended suddenly when Purviance read a newspaper report of Chaplin having married 16-year-old Mildred Harris.

Purviance appeared in 33 of Chaplin&#x27;s productions, including the 1921 &quot;The Kid&quot;. Her last credited appearance in a Chaplin film, &quot;A Woman of Paris&quot;, was also her first leading role. The film was not a success and effectively ended Purviance&#x27;s career. She appeared in two more films: &quot;Sea Gulls&quot;, also known as &quot;A Woman of the Sea&quot; (which Chaplin never released) and &quot;Éducation de Prince&quot;, a French film released in 1927.

Purviance was peripherally involved in a scandal. She and Mabel Normand were guests of millionaire oil broker Courtland Stark Dines (1889-1945) on New Year’s Day 1924. Mabel’s chauffeur, R. C. Greer, alias Joe Kelly, got into an argument with Dines, produced a revolver and shot him, not fatally. As a result some cities banned &quot;A Woman of Paris&quot;.

Between Purviance&#x27;s last film in 1924 and her death in 1958, Chaplin kept her on the payroll at $1000 a month.

===1927–1958: Retirement and later years===
For more than 30 years afterward, Edna Purviance lived quietly outside Hollywood. Purviance married John Squire, a Pan-American Airlines pilot, in 1938. They remained married until his death in 1945.

Chaplin kept Purviance on his payroll. She received a small monthly salary from Chaplin&#x27;s film company until she got married, and the payments resumed after her husband&#x27;s death. She later played bit roles in Chaplin&#x27;s last two American movies, &quot;Monsieur Verdoux&quot; and &quot;Limelight&quot;.

“How could I forget Edna?” Chaplin responded to an interviewer after her death. &quot;She was with me when it all began.&quot;

In her posthumously published memoir, actress Georgia Hale, who played opposite Chaplin in &quot;The Gold Rush&quot; (1925), reported that Chaplin always spoke affectionately of Purviance. Hale relates Chaplin’s account of an incident during the silent film era, when Chaplin and Purvience—he in “an old sweatshirt” and she in “a cotton house dress”—stopped at the exclusive Riverside Inn “looking like hoboes.” The head waiter, alarmed at the couple&#x27;s appearance, ushered them to the back of the restaurant:

==Death==
On January 13, 1958, Purviance died from throat cancer at the Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, California, aged 62. Her remains are interred at Grand View Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

==In popular culture==
She was portrayed by Penelope Ann Miller in the film &quot;Chaplin&quot; (1992) and by Katie Maguire in the film &quot;Madcap Mabel&quot; (2010).

In the TV series &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot; (series three, episode four), the character Tatiana Petrovna played by Gaite Jansen is said to resemble her.

<doc id="335028" wikidata="Q551888" url="?curid=335028" title="Wars of Alexander the Great">
<text>The wars of Alexander the Great () were a series of conquests carried out by Alexander III of Macedon from 336 to 323 BC. They began with battles against the Achaemenid Empire, then under the rule of Darius III. After Alexander&#x27;s chain of victories, he began a campaign against local chieftains and warlords that stretched from Greece to as far as the region of Punjab in South Asia. By the time he died, Alexander ruled over most regions of Greece and the conquered Achaemenid Empire, including much of Achaemenid Egypt; he did not, however, manage to conquer the Indian subcontinent in its entirety according to his initial plan. 

Despite his military accomplishments, Alexander did not provide any stable alternative to the rule of the Achaemenids, and his untimely death threw the vast territories he conquered into a series of civil wars commonly known as the Wars of the Diadochi.

Alexander assumed kingship over ancient Macedonia following the assassination of his father, Philip II (). During his two decades on the throne, Philip II had unified the &quot;polis&quot; (Greek city-states) of mainland Greece (with Macedonian hegemony) under the League of Corinth. Alexander proceeded to solidify Macedonian rule by quashing a rebellion in the southern Greek city-states and staged a short but bloody excursion against the city-states to the north. He then proceeded east to carry out his plans to conquer the Achaemenid Empire. His campaign of conquests from Greece spanned across Anatolia, Syria, Phoenicia, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greater Iran, Afghanistan, and India. He extended the boundaries of his Macedonian Empire as far east as the city of Taxila in modern-day Pakistan.

Prior to his death, Alexander had also made plans for a Macedonian military and mercantile expansion into the Arabian Peninsula, after which he planned to turn his armies to Carthage, Rome, and the Iberian Peninsula in the west. However, the Diadochi (his political rivals) abandoned these plans after he died; instead, within a few years of Alexander&#x27;s death, the Diadochi began a series of military campaigns against each other and divided the territories of the Macedonian Empire among themselves, triggering 40 years of warfare during the Hellenistic period.

== Historical campaigns ==

=== Background ===

In 336 BC, Philip II was assassinated by the captain of his bodyguards, Pausanias of Orestis. Philip&#x27;s son, and previously designated heir, Alexander, was proclaimed king by the Macedonian noblemen and army. He also succeeded his father as head of the League of Corinth, a confederation of Greek states that were under the hegemony of Macedonia in order to combat the Achaemenid Empire. In this way, the Macedonian king subjugated the Greek polis.

News of Philip&#x27;s death roused many states into revolt, including Thebes, Athens, Thessaly, as well as the Thracian tribes to the north of Macedon. When news of the revolt reached Alexander, he took quick action. Although his advisers recommended the use of diplomacy, Alexander ignored the advice and instead proceeded to gather his Macedonian cavalry of 3,000 men. Together, the army rode south towards Thessaly (Macedon&#x27;s immediate neighbor to the south). When he found the Thessalian army blocking the pass between Mount Olympus and Mount Ossa, he had his men ride over Mount Ossa. When the Thessalians awoke, they found Alexander at their rear. The Thessalians quickly surrendered, and their cavalry was added to Alexander&#x27;s force. He then proceeded south, towards the Peloponnese.

Alexander stopped at Thermopylae, where he was recognized as the leader of the Sacred League before heading south to Corinth. Athens sued for peace and Alexander received the envoy and pardoned anyone involved with the uprising. At Corinth, he was given the title &#x27;Hegemon&#x27; of the Greek forces against the Persians. Whilst at Corinth, he heard the news of a Thracian uprising in the north.

=== Balkan campaign ===

Before crossing to Asia, Alexander wanted to safeguard his northern borders and, in the spring of 335 BC, he advanced into Thrace to deal with the revolt, which was led by the Illyrians and Triballi. At Mount Haemus, the Macedonian army attacked and defeated a Thracian garrison manning the heights. The Macedonians were then attacked in the rear by the Triballi, who were crushed in turn. Alexander then advanced on to the Danube, encountering the Getae tribe on the opposite shore. The Getae army retreated after the first cavalry skirmish, leaving their town to the Macedonian army. News then reached Alexander that Cleitus, King of Illyria, and King Glaukias of the Taulantii were in open revolt against Macedonian authority. Alexander defeated each in turn, forcing Cleitus and Glaukias to flee with their armies, leaving Alexander&#x27;s northern frontier secure.

While he was triumphantly campaigning north, the Thebans and Athenians rebelled once more. Alexander reacted immediately, but, while the other cities once again hesitated, Thebes decided to resist with the utmost vigor. This resistance was useless, however, as the city was razed to the ground amid great bloodshed and its territory divided between the other Boeotian cities. The end of Thebes cowed Athens into submission, leaving all of Greece at least outwardly at peace with Alexander.

=== Persia ===
==== Asia Minor ====
In 334 BC, Alexander crossed the Hellespont into Asia. It took over one hundred triremes (triple-banked galleys) to transport the entire Macedonian army, but the Persians decided to ignore the movement.

In these early months, Darius still refused to take Alexander seriously or mount a serious challenge to Alexander&#x27;s movements. Memnon of Rhodes, the Greek mercenary who aligned himself with the Persians, advocated for a scorched earth strategy. He wanted the Persians to destroy the land in front of Alexander, which he hoped would force Alexander&#x27;s army to starve, and then to turn back. The satraps in Anatolia rejected this advice, considering it their duty to defend their land. Eventually, with Alexander advancing deeper into Persian territory, Darius ordered all five satraps of the Anatolian provinces to pool their military resources together and confront Alexander. This army was guided by Memnon, while absolute command was split among the five satraps.

===== Battle of the Granicus River =====

The Battle of the Granicus River in May 334 BC was fought in Northwestern Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey), near the site of Troy. After crossing the Hellespont, Alexander advanced up the road to the capital of the Satrapy of Phrygia. The various satraps of the Persian Empire gathered their forces at the town of Zelea and offered battle on the banks of the Granicus River. Alexander ultimately fought many of his battles on a river bank. By doing so, he was able to minimize the advantage the Persians had in numbers. In addition, the deadly Persian chariots were useless on a cramped, muddy river bank.

Arrian, Diodorus, and Plutarch all mention the battle, with Arrian providing the most detail. The Persians placed their cavalry in front of their infantry, and drew up on the right (east) bank of the river. The Macedonian line was arrayed with the heavy Phalanxes in the middle, Macedonian cavalry led by Alexander on the right, and allied Thessalian cavalry led by Parmenion on the left. The Persians expected the main assault to come from Alexander&#x27;s position and moved units from their center to that flank.
Alexander&#x27;s second-in-command, Parmenion, suggested crossing the river upstream and attacking at dawn the next day, but Alexander attacked immediately. He ordered a small group of cavalry and light infantry to attack from the Macedonian right to draw the Persians off the bank and into the river. Seeing that he had broken the Persian line, Alexander led his horse companions in oblique order further to the right in order to outflank the Persians and buy time for his infantry to cross the river. Several high-ranking Persian nobles were killed by Alexander himself or his bodyguards, although Alexander was stunned by an axe-blow from a Persian nobleman named Spithridates. Before the noble could deal a death-blow, however, he was killed by Cleitus the Black. The Macedonian cavalry opened a hole in the Persian line as the Macedonian infantry advanced, forcing the enemy back and eventually breaking their center. The Persian cavalry turned and fled the battlefield, and the Greek mercenary infantry they held in reserve were encircled by the Macedonians and slaughtered; only around two-thousand of which survived, and were sent back to Macedonia for labor.

===== Alexander consolidates support in Asia Minor =====
After the battle, Alexander buried the dead Greeks and Persians and sent the captured Greek mercenaries back to Greece to work in the mines as an abject lesson for any Greek who decided to fight for the Persians. He sent some of the spoils back to Greece, including three hundred panoplies (complete Persian suits of armor) back to Athens to be dedicated in the Parthenon with the inscription &quot;Alexander, son of Philip and the Greeks, Lacedaemonians (Spartans) excepted, these spoils from the barbarians who dwell in Asia&quot;.

Antipater, whom Alexander had left in charge of Macedon in his absence, had been given a free hand to install dictators and tyrants wherever he saw fit in order to minimize the risk of a rebellion. As he moved deeper into Persia, however, the threat of trouble seemed to grow. Many of these towns had been ruled for generations by heavy handed tyrants, so in these Persian towns, he did the opposite of what he did in Greece. Wanting to appear to be a liberator, he freed the population and allowed self-government. As he continued marching into Persia, he saw that his victory at Granicus had been lost on no one. Town after town seemed to surrender to him. The satrap at Sardis, as well as his garrison, was among the first of many satraps to capitulate.

As these satraps gave up, Alexander appointed new ones to replace them, and claimed to distrust the accumulation of absolute power into anyone&#x27;s hands. There appeared to be little change from the old system. Alexander, however, appointed independent boards to collect tribute and taxes from the satrapies, which appeared to do nothing more than improve the efficiency of government. The true effect, however, was to separate the civil from the financial function of these satrapies, thus ensuring that these governments, while technically independent of him, never truly were. Otherwise, he allowed the inhabitants of these towns to continue as they always had, and made no attempt to impose Greek customs on them. Meanwhile, ambassadors from other Greek cities in Asia Minor came to Alexander, offering submission if he allowed their &#x27;democracies&#x27; to continue. Alexander granted their wish, and allowed them to stop paying taxes to Persia, but only if they joined the League of Corinth. By doing so, they promised to provide monetary support to Alexander.

===== Siege of Halicarnassus =====

The Siege of Halicarnassus was undertaken in 334 BC. Alexander, who had a weak navy, was constantly being threatened by the Persian navy. It continuously attempted to provoke an engagement with Alexander, who would have none of it. Eventually, the Persian fleet sailed to Halicarnassus, in order to establish a new defense. Ada of Caria, the former queen of Halicarnassus, had been driven from her throne by her usurping brother. When he died, Darius had appointed Orontobates satrap of Caria, which included Halicarnassus in its jurisdiction. On the approach of Alexander in 334 BC, Ada, who was in possession of the fortress of Alinda, surrendered the fortress to him. Alexander and Ada appear to have formed an emotional connection. He called her &quot;mother&quot;, finding her more amicable than his cal snake-worshiping mother Olympias. In return for his support, Ada gave Alexander gifts, and even sent him some of the best cooks in Asia Minor, realizing that Alexander had a sweet tooth. In the past, Alexander had referred to his biological father, Philip, as his &quot;so-called&quot; father, and preferred to think of the deity Amon Zeus as his actual father. Thus, he had finally managed to divorce himself from both of his biological parents.

Orontobates and Memnon of Rhodes entrenched themselves in Halicarnassus. Alexander had sent spies to meet with dissidents inside the city, who had promised to open the gates and allow Alexander to enter. When his spies arrived, however, the dissidents were nowhere to be found. A small battle resulted, and Alexander&#x27;s army managed to break through the city walls. Memnon, however, now deployed his catapults, and Alexander&#x27;s army fell back. Memnon then deployed his infantry, and shortly before Alexander would have received his first (and only) defeat, his infantry managed to break through the city walls, surprising the Persian forces and killing Orontobates. Memnon, realizing the city was lost, set fire to it and withdrew with his army. A strong wind caused the fire to destroy much of the city. Alexander then committed the government of Caria to Ada; and she, in turn, formally adopted Alexander as her son, ensuring that the rule of Caria passed unconditionally to him upon her eventual death.

==== Syria ====
Shortly after the battle, Memnon died. His replacement was a Persian who had spent time in Macedonia called Pharnabazus. He disrupted Alexander&#x27;s supply routes by taking Aegean islands near the Hellespont and by fomenting rebellion in southern Greece. Meanwhile, Darius took the Persian army to intercept Alexander.

Alexander marched his army east through Cappadocia, where, for a stretch of nearly , there was no water. As his army approached Mount Taurus, they found only one route through which to pass, which was a narrow defile called &quot;The Gates&quot;. The defile was very narrow, and could have been easily defended. However, the Persian satrap of Cappadocia had an inflated view of his own abilities. He had been at the Battle of the Granicus River, and had believed that Memnon&#x27;s scorched Earth strategy would work here. He did not realize that the different circumstances of the terrain made that strategy useless. Had he mounted a credible defence of the defile, Alexander would have been easily repulsed. He left only a small contingent to guard the defile, and took his entire army to destroy the plain that lay ahead of Alexander&#x27;s army. The Persian contingent that was supposed to guard the defile soon abandoned it, and Alexander passed through without any problems. Alexander supposedly said after this incident that he had never been so lucky in his entire career.

After reaching Mount Taurus, Alexander&#x27;s army found a stream that flowed from the mountain with water that was ice cold. Not thinking, Alexander jumped into the stream, suffered a cramp and then a convulsion, and was pulled out nearly dead. He quickly developed pneumonia, but none of his physicians would treat him, because they feared that, if he died, they would be held responsible. One physician named Philip, who had treated Alexander since he was a child, agreed to treat him. Although he soon fell into a coma, he eventually recovered.

===== Battle of Issus =====
The Battle of Issus took place in southern Anatolia on November 333 BC. After Alexander&#x27;s forces defeated the Persians at the Battle of the Granicus, Darius took personal charge of his army, gathered a large army from the depths of the empire, and maneuvered to cut the Greek line of supply, requiring Alexander to countermarch his forces, setting the stage for the battle near the mouth of the Pinarus River and south of the village of Issus. Darius was apparently unaware that, by deciding to stage the battle on a river bank, he was minimizing the numerical advantage his army had over Alexander&#x27;s.

Initially, Alexander chose what was apparently unfavorable ground. This surprised Darius who mistakenly elected to hold the wrong position while Alexander instructed his infantry to take up a defensive posture. Alexander personally led the more elite Greek Companion cavalry against the Persian left up against the hills, and cut up the enemy on the less encumbering terrain, thereby generating a quick rout. After achieving a breakthrough, Alexander demonstrated he could do the difficult thing and held the cavalry in check after it broke the Persian right. Alexander then mounted his beloved horse Bucephalus, took his place at the head of his Companion cavalry, and led a direct assault against Darius. The horses that were pulling Darius&#x27; chariot were injured, and began tossing at the yoke. Darius, about to fall off his chariot, instead jumped off. He threw his royal diadem away, mounted a horse, and fled the scene. The Persian troops, realizing they had lost, either surrendered or fled with their hapless king. The Macedonian cavalry pursued the fleeing Persians for as long as there was light. As with most ancient battles, significant carnage occurred after the battle as pursuing Macedonians slaughtered their crowded, disorganized foe.

The invading troops led by Alexander were outnumbered more than 2:1, yet they defeated the army personally led by Darius III of Achaemenid Persia. The battle was a decisive Macedonian victory and it marked the beginning of the end of Persian power. It was the first time the Persian army had been defeated with the King present on the field. Darius left his wife and an enormous amount of treasure behind as his army fled. The greed of the Macedonians helped to persuade them to keep going, as did the large number of Persian concubines and prostitutes they picked up in the battle. Darius, now fearing for both his throne and his life, sent a letter to Alexander in which he promised to pay a substantial ransom in exchange for the prisoners of war, and agreeing to a treaty of alliance with and the forfeiture of half of his empire to Alexander. Darius received a response which began &quot;King Alexander to Darius&quot;. In the letter, Alexander blamed Darius for his father&#x27;s death and claimed Darius was but a vulgar usurper, who planned to take Macedonia. He agreed to return the prisoners without ransom, but told Darius that he and Alexander were not equals, and that Darius was to henceforth address Alexander as &quot;King of all Asia&quot;. Darius was also curtly informed that, if he wanted to dispute Alexander&#x27;s claim to the Achaemenid throne, that he would have to stand and fight, and that if he instead fled, Alexander would pursue and kill him. By this, Alexander revealed for the first time that his plan was to conquer the entire Persian Empire.

===== Siege of Tyre =====

The Siege of Tyre occurred in 332 BC when Alexander set out to conquer Tyre, a strategic coastal base. Tyre was the site of the only remaining Persian port that did not capitulate to Alexander. Even by this point in the war, the Persian navy still posed a major threat to Alexander. Tyre, the largest and most important city-state of Phoenicia, was located both on the Mediterranean coast as well as a nearby Island with two natural harbors on the landward side. At the time of the siege, the city held approximately 40,000 people, though the women and children were evacuated to Carthage, an ancient Phoenician colony.

Alexander sent an envoy to Tyre, proposing a peace treaty, and asked to visit their city and offer sacrifices to their God Melqart. The Tyrians politely told Alexander that their town was neutral in the war, and that allowing him to offer sacrifices to Melqart would be tantamount to recognizing him as their king. Alexander considered building a causeway that would allow his army to take the town by force. His engineers did not believe it would be possible to build such a massive structure, and so Alexander sent peace envoys once more to propose an alliance. The Tyrians believed this to be a sign of weakness, and so they killed the envoys and threw their bodies over the city wall. The dissent against Alexander&#x27;s plans to take the city by force disappeared, and his engineers began to design the structure. Alexander began with an engineering feat that shows the true extent of his brilliance; as he could not attack the city from sea, he built a kilometer-long causeway stretching out to the island on a natural land bridge no more than two meters deep. Alexander then constructed two towers 150 feet high and moved them to the end of the causeway. The Tyrians, however, quickly devised a counterattack. They used an old horse transport ship, filling it with dried branches, pitch, sulfur, and various other combustibles. They then lit it on fire, creating what we might call a primitive form of napalm, and ran it up onto the causeway. The fire spread quickly, engulfing both towers and other siege equipment that had been brought up.

This convinced Alexander that he would be unable to take Tyre without a navy. Fate would soon provide him with one. Presently, the Persian navy returned to find their home cities under Alexander&#x27;s control. Since their allegiance was to their city, they were therefore Alexander&#x27;s. He now had eighty ships. This coincided with the arrival of another hundred and twenty from Cyprus, which had heard of his victories and wished to join him. Alexander then sailed on Tyre and quickly blockaded both ports with his superior numbers. He had several of the slower galleys, and a few barges, refit with battering rams, the only known case of battering rams being used on ships. Alexander started testing the wall at various points with his rams, until he made a small breach in the south end of the island. He then coordinated an attack across the breach with a bombardment from all sides by his navy. Once his troops forced their way into the city, they easily overtook the garrison, and quickly captured the city. Those citizens that took shelter in the temple of Heracles were pardoned by Alexander. It is said that Alexander was so enraged at the Tyrians&#x27; defense and the loss of his men that he destroyed half the city. Alexander granted pardon to the king and his family, whilst 30,000 residents and foreigners taken were sold into slavery. There was a family, though, that Alexander gave a very high position in his government, but the only contact he ever had with them was when he spent the night with the wife of the household.

==== Egypt ====

===== Siege of Gaza =====
The stronghold at Gaza was built on a hill and was heavily fortified. The inhabitants of Gaza and their Nabataean allies did not want to lose the lucrative trade which was controlled by Gaza.
Batis, the commander of the fortress of Gaza, refused to surrender to Alexander. Though a eunuch, Batis was physically imposing and ruthless. After three unsuccessful assaults, the stronghold was finally taken by force, but not before Alexander received a serious shoulder wound. When Gaza was taken, the male population was put to the sword and the women and children were sold into slavery. According to the Roman historian Quintus Curtius Rufus, Batis was killed by Alexander in imitation of Achilles&#x27; treatment of the fallen Hector. A rope was forced through Batis&#x27;s ankles, probably between the ankle bone and the Achilles tendon, and Batis was dragged alive by chariot beneath the walls of the city. Alexander, who admired courage in his enemies and might have been inclined to show mercy to the brave Persian general, was infuriated at Batis&#x27;s refusal to kneel and by the enemy commander&#x27;s haughty silence and contemptuous manner.

With Gaza taken, Alexander marched into Egypt. His entry was described as &quot;closer to a triumphant procession than an invasion.&quot; They welcomed Alexander as their king, placed him on the throne of the Pharaohs, giving him the crown of Upper and Lower Egypt, and named him the incarnation of Ra and Osiris. He set in motion plans to build Alexandria, and, though future tax revenues would be channeled to him, he left Egypt under the management of Egyptians, which helped to win him their support. 

==== Mesopotamia ====
===== Battle of Gaugamela =====
The Battle of Gaugamela took place in 331 BC in what is now Iraqi Kurdistan, possibly near Dohuk, and resulted in a decisive victory for the Macedonians. After the Siege of Gaza, Alexander advanced from Syria towards the heart of the Persian Empire, crossing both the Euphrates and the Tigris rivers without any opposition. Darius was building up a massive army, drawing men from the far reaches of his empire, and planned to use sheer numbers to crush Alexander. Though Alexander had conquered part of the Persian empire, it was still vast in area and in manpower reserves, and Darius could recruit more men than Alexander could dream of. Also present in the Persian army, a sign that the Persians were still very powerful, were the feared war elephants. While Darius had a significant advantage in number of soldiers, most of his troops were not as organized as Alexander&#x27;s.
The battle began with the Persians already present at the battlefield. Darius had recruited the finest cavalry from his eastern satrapies. Darius placed himself in the center with his best infantry as was the tradition among Persian kings. The Macedonians were divided into two, with the right side of the army falling under the direct command of Alexander, and the left to Parmenion. Alexander began by ordering his infantry to march in phalanx formation towards the center of the enemy line. Darius now launched his chariots, which were intercepted by the Agrianians, and quickly rendered useless. Alexander, while leading the charge, formed his units into a giant wedge, which quickly smashed right into the weakened Persian center. Darius&#x27; charioteer was killed by a spear, and chaos rang out as everyone (incorrectly) thought it was Darius who had been killed. The Persian line then collapsed, and Darius fled. Darius escaped with a small core of his forces remaining intact, although the Bactrian cavalry and Bessus soon caught up with him. The remaining Persian resistance was quickly put down. In all, the Battle of Gaugamela was a disastrous defeat for the Persians, and possibly one of Alexander&#x27;s finest victories.

==== Persis ====

After the battle, Parmenion rounded up the Persian baggage train while Alexander and his own bodyguard chased after Darius in hopes of catching up. Substantial amounts of loot were gained following the battle, with 4,000 talents captured, as well as the King&#x27;s personal chariot and bow. Darius planned to head further east, and raise another army to face Alexander while he and the Macedonians headed to one of the Persian capitals, Babylon, and then to another, Susa. There, Alexander found wealth that even he had never imagined possible. He paid his troops, and sent a sum of money six times the annual income of Athens to Greece, in order to put down a Spartan rebellion. Darius, meanwhile, dispatched letters to his eastern satrapies asking them to remain loyal. The satrapies, however, had other intentions, and quickly capitulated to Alexander.

Bessus fatally stabbed Darius, before fleeing eastwards. Darius was found by one of Alexander&#x27;s scouts, moaning in pain. Darius, dying and chained to a baggage train being pulled by an ox, was lying next to a lone dog and his royal robes were covered in blood. He asked for water, and then, clutching the Macedonian soldier&#x27;s hand, said that he was thankful that he would not die utterly alone and abandoned. Alexander, who may have felt genuinely saddened at Darius&#x27; death, buried Darius next to his Achaemenid predecessors in a full military funeral. Alexander claimed that, while dying, Darius had named Alexander as his successor to the Achaemenid throne and had asked Alexander to avenge his death, a striking irony since it was Alexander who had pursued him to his death. The Achaemenid Persian Empire is considered to have fallen with the death of Darius.

Alexander, viewing himself as the legitimate Achaemenid successor to Darius, viewed Bessus as a usurper to the Achaemenid throne, and eventually found and executed this &#x27;usurper&#x27;. The majority of the existing satraps were to give their loyalty to Alexander, and be allowed to keep their positions. Alexander&#x27;s troops now thought the war was over. Alexander was unsure how to deal with this, so he decided to scare them into submission. He gave a speech, arguing that their conquests were not secure, that the Persians did not want the Greeks to remain in their country, and that only the strength of Macedon could secure the country. The speech worked, and Alexander&#x27;s troops agreed to remain with him. Alexander, now the Persian &quot;King of Kings&quot;, adopted Persian dress and mannerisms, which, in time, the Greeks began to view as decadent and autocratic. They began to fear that Alexander, the king they had hero-worshiped, was turning into an eastern despot, although a young eunuch was eventually introduced to Alexander, and helped to keep his decadence in check.

==== Battle of the Persian Gate ====
In the winter of 330 BC, at the Battle of the Persian Gate northeast of today&#x27;s Yasuj in Iran, the Persian satrap Ariobarzanes led a last stand of the Persian forces. After the Battle of Gaugamela in present-day Iraqi Kurdistan, Alexander had advanced to Babylon and Susa. A Royal Road connected Susa with the more eastern capitals of Persepolis and Pasargadae in Persis (the Persian Empire had several &quot;capitals&quot;), and was the natural venue for Alexander&#x27;s continued campaign. After the conquest of Susa, Alexander split the Macedonian army into two parts. Alexander&#x27;s general, Parmenion, took one half along the Royal Road, and Alexander himself took the route towards Persis. Passing into Persis required traversing the Persian Gates, a narrow mountain pass that lent itself easily to ambush.

Believing that, after his victory over the Uxians, he would not encounter any more enemy forces during his march, Alexander neglected to send scouts ahead of his vanguard, and thus walked into Ariobarzanes&#x27; ambush. Once the Macedonian army had advanced sufficiently into the narrow pass, the Persians rained down boulders on them from the northern slopes. From the southern slope, Persian archers and catapults launched their projectiles. Alexander&#x27;s army initially suffered heavy casualties, losing entire platoons at a time. Ariobarzanes had hoped that defeating Alexander at the Persian Gates would allow the Persians more time to field another army, and possibly stop the Macedonian invasion altogether.

Ariobarzanes held the pass for a month, but Alexander succeeded in encircling the Persian army and broke through the Persian defenses. The defeat of Ariobarzanes&#x27;s forces at the Persian Gate removed the last military obstacle between Alexander and Persepolis. Upon his arrival at the city of Persepolis, Alexander appointed a general named Phrasaortes as successor of Ariobarzanes. Four months later, Alexander allowed the troops to loot Persepolis. A fire broke out and spread to the rest of the city. It is not clear if it had been a drunken accident, or a deliberate act of revenge for the burning of the Acropolis of Athens during the Second Greco-Persian War.

=== Siege of the Sogdian Rock ===
==== Bactria ====
In 329 BC, Alexander launched the Siege of Cyropolis and fought against the Sakas in Battle of Jaxartes. After Alexander defeated the last of the Achaemenid Empire&#x27;s forces in battle of Gabai against Spitamenes, and Coenus (Koinos), one Alexander the Great&#x27;s generals in 328 BC, he began a new campaign to Ariana in 327 BC. He wanted to conquer the entire known world, which in Alexander&#x27;s day, ended on the eastern end of India. Greeks of Alexander&#x27;s day knew nothing of China, or any other lands east of Bactria. The Siege of the Sogdian Rock, a fortress located north of Bactria in Sogdiana, occurred in 327 BC. Oxyartes of Bactria had sent his wife and daughters, one of whom was Roxana, to take refuge in the fortress, as it was thought to be impregnable, and was provisioned for a long siege. When Alexander asked the defenders to surrender, they refused, telling him that he would need &quot;men with wings&quot; to capture it. Alexander asked for volunteers, whom he would reward if they could climb the cliffs under the fortress. There were some 300 men who from previous sieges had gained experience in rock-climbing. Using tent-pegs and strong flaxen lines, they climbed the cliff face at night, losing about 30 of their number during the ascent. In accordance with Alexander&#x27;s orders, they signaled their success to the troops below by waving bits of linen, and Alexander sent a herald to shout the news to the enemy&#x27;s advanced posts that they might now surrender without further delay. The defenders were so surprised and demoralized by this that they surrendered. Alexander fell in love with Roxana, whom ancient historians call the &quot;most beautiful woman in the world&quot; (not an uncommon claim for an ancient queen), on sight and eventually married her. The story of the siege is told by the Roman historian Arrian of Nicomedia, in Anabasis (section 4.18.4–19.6).

=== Indian campaign ===

After the death of Spitamenes and his marriage to Roxana (Roshanak in Bactrian) to cement his relations with his new Central Asian satrapies, Alexander was finally free to turn his attention to the Indian subcontinent. Alexander invited all the chieftains of the former satrapy of Gandhara, in the north of what is now the Jhelum River, Pakistan, to come to him and submit to his authority. Omphis, ruler of Taxila, whose kingdom extended from the Indus to the Hydaspes, complied, but the chieftains of some hill clans, including the Aspasioi and Assakenoi sections of the Kambojas (known in Indian texts also as Ashvayanas and Ashvakayanas), refused to submit.

In the winter of 327/326 BC, Alexander personally led a campaign against these clans; the Aspasioi of Kunar valley, the Guraeans of the Guraeus valley, and the Assakenoi of the Swat and Buner valleys. A fierce contest ensued with the Aspasioi in which Alexander himself was wounded in the shoulder by a dart but eventually the Aspasioi lost the fight. Alexander then faced the Assakenoi, who fought bravely and offered stubborn resistance to Alexander in the strongholds of Massaga, Ora and Aornos. The fort of Massaga could only be reduced after several days of bloody fighting in which Alexander himself was wounded seriously in the ankle. According to Curtius, &quot;Not only did Alexander slaughter the entire population of Massaga, but also did he reduce its buildings to rubbles&quot;. A similar slaughter then followed at Ora, another stronghold of the Assakenoi. In the aftermath of Massaga and Ora, numerous Assakenians fled to the fortress of Aornos. Alexander followed close behind their heels and captured the strategic hill-fort after the fourth day of a bloody fight. This fight was the challenge Alexander was looking for, an army with huge elephants that were almost able to defeat Alexander.
After gaining control of the former Achaemenid satrapy of Gandhara, including the city of Taxila, Alexander advanced into Punjab, where he engaged in battle against the regional king Porus, whom Alexander defeated in the Battle of the Hydaspes in 326 BC, but was so impressed by the demeanor with which the king carried himself that he allowed Porus to continue governing his own kingdom as a satrap. Although victorious, Battle of the Hydaspes was also the most costly battle fought by the Macedonians.

East of Porus&#x27; kingdom, near the Ganges River, was the powerful Nanda Empire of Magadha. According to the Greek sources, the Nanda army was five times larger than the Macedonian army. Fearing the prospects of facing the powerful Nanda Empire armies and exhausted by years of campaigning, his army mutinied at the Hyphasis River, refusing to march further east. This river thus marks the easternmost extent of Alexander&#x27;s conquests. As for the Macedonians, however, their struggle with Porus blunted their courage and stayed their further advance into India. For having done all they could do to repulse an enemy who mustered only twenty thousand infantry and two thousand horse, they violently opposed Alexander when he insisted on crossing the river Ganges also, the width of which, as they learned, was thirty-two furlongs, its depth a hundred fathoms, while its banks on the further side were covered with multitudes of men-at-arms and horsemen and elephants. For they were told that the kings of the Ganderites and Praesii were awaiting them with eighty thousand horsemen, two hundred thousand footmen, eight thousand chariots, and six thousand fighting elephants.

Alexander spoke to his army and tried to persuade them to march further into India but Coenus pleaded with him to change his opinion and return, the men, he said, &quot;longed to again see their parents, their wives and children, their homeland&quot;. Alexander, seeing the unwillingness of his men agreed and diverted. Along the way his army conquered the Malli clans (in modern-day Multan). In the territory of the Indus, he nominated his officer Peithon as a satrap, a position he would hold for the next ten years until 316 BC, and in the Punjab he left Eudemus in charge of the army, at the side of the satrap Porus and Taxiles. Eudemus became ruler of a part of the Punjab after their death. Both rulers returned to the West in 316 BC with their armies. In 321 BC, Chandragupta Maurya founded the Maurya Empire in India and overthrew the Greek satraps.

=== Return from India ===
Alexander now sent much of his army to Carmania (modern southern Iran) with his general Craterus, and commissioned a fleet to explore the Persian Gulf shore under his admiral Nearchus, while he led the rest of his forces back to Persia by the southern route through the Gedrosian Desert (now part of southern Iran and Makran now part of Pakistan). According to Plutarch, during the 60-day march through the desert, Alexander lost three-quarters of his army to the harsh desert conditions along the way.

<text>Linn&#x27;s Stamp News is an American weekly magazine for stamp collectors. It is published by Amos Media Co., which also publishes the Scott &quot;Standard Postage Stamp Catalogue&quot;, the Scott &quot;Specialized Catalogue of United States Stamps and Covers&quot;, and the Scott &quot;Classic Specialized Catalogue of Stamps and Covers 1840–1940&quot;. &quot;Linn&#x27;s&quot; was founded in 1928 by George W. Linn as &quot;Linn&#x27;s Weekly Stamp News&quot;.

The size of the paper shrank in late 2007.

==Description==
The front page of the publication features news from the stamp world, including significant new stamp issues around the world, major auctions of rare items, significant new discoveries, philatelic controversies, and notable events, such as eBay&#x27;s ending two programs that regularly examined stamp and coin listings for the purpose of deterring fraudulent sales.

Each issue has additional news stories inside along with a wide variety of features and columns.

Regular features include:
* &quot;U.S. Stamp News&quot; by John Hotchner, a weekly column that touches on a variety of unusual and interesting U.S. stamps and covers, along with a monthly column on stamp expertizing and a monthly cartoon contest.
* &quot;Editor&#x27;s Insights&quot; by Charles Snee, editor of &quot;Linn&#x27;s&quot; and the Scott catalogs. Snee discusses numerous topics and current news of interest to collectors.
* &quot;Washington Postal Scene&quot; by veteran reporter Bill McAllister, whose in-depth stories on news involving the United States Postal Service have gained national attention.
* &quot;Kitchen Table Philately&quot; by two pseudonymous mixture reviewers, &quot;E. Rawolik VI&quot; and &quot;E Rawolik VII&quot; (&quot;kiloware&quot; spelled backward). Both reviewers report on the contents of stamp mixtures (also known as kiloware) bought from dealers advertising in &quot;Linn&#x27;s&quot;. They use the number of stamps in the mixture and pricing to determine whether a particular mixture is a good value or is overpriced.
* &quot;Collector&#x27;s Forum&quot; is about unusual stamps or usages reported by collectors. When the &quot;Linn&#x27;s&quot; staff can answer the inquiry, they provide details. In other cases, the answer is provided by readers in a subsequent &quot;Forum Update.&quot;
* &quot;Stamp Market Tips&quot; gives readers tips on stamps that the columnists consider to be of good value.
* The &quot;Stamp Events Calendar&quot; and &quot;Auction Calendar&quot; indicate forthcoming events.
* The United States Stamp Program is a weekly feature. Stamp programs of Canada and the United Nations are published monthly.

==&quot;Linn&#x27;s Stamp News Monthly&quot;==
Collectors who subscribe to the weekly publication also received &quot;Linn&#x27;s Stamp News Monthly&quot;. 
&quot;Linn&#x27;s Stamp News Monthly&quot; included a special section devoted to new listings in the Scott catalog. The monthly publication also features:
* &quot;Auction Roundup&quot; by &quot;Linn&#x27;s&quot; New York Correspondent Matthew Healey, which offered coverage of recent auctions and the prices realized at those sales.
* &quot;Spotlight&quot; by noted stamp writer Ken Lawrence, who presented in-depth research on a variety of stamp topics.
* &quot;Amazing Stamp Stories&quot; by David Lodge and Patrick Reynolds, a cartoon-style feature on rare and interesting stamps.

Collectors also can subscribe to &quot;Linn&#x27;s Stamp News Monthly&quot; only, at a reduced price. Subscribers can read the complete contents online at no extra charge. Several eNewsletters are sent each week that contain excerpts to Linn’s stories with links to the full story online.

==Publication changes==
In 2023 Amos Media Co. announced changes to the publication of &quot;Linn&#x27;s Stamp News&quot;. The monthly publication changed its name to &quot;Scott Stamp Monthly&quot;. Additionally the weekly &quot;Linn&#x27;s Stamp News&quot; changed to 52 issues per year; however, only 24 were physical publications with the rest being digital only. These changes went into effect 6 March 2023.

<doc id="335035" wikidata="Q27074603" url="?curid=335035" title="Sooty shearwater">
<text>The sooty shearwater (Ardenna grisea) is a medium-large shearwater in the seabird family Procellariidae. In New Zealand, it is also known by its Māori name , and is harvested by Māori people for muttonbird, like its relatives the wedge-tailed shearwater (&quot;A. pacificus&quot;) and the Australian short-tailed shearwater (&quot;A. tenuirostris&quot;).

==Taxonomy==
The sooty shearwater was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin under the binomial name &quot;Procellaria grisea&quot;. The shearwater had been briefly described in 1777 by James Cook in the account of his second voyage to the Pacific, but without a valid scientific name; and also in 1785 the English ornithologist John Latham had described a museum specimen, again without giving it a scientific name. The sooty shearwater is now placed in the genus &quot;Ardenna&quot;, that was described in 1853 by Ludwig Reichenbach. The genus name &quot;Ardenna&quot; was used to refer to a seabird by Italian naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi in 1603, and the specific epithet &quot;grisea&quot; is medieval Latin for &quot;grey&quot;. The species is considered to be monotypic; no subspecies are recognised.

It appears to be particularly closely related to the great shearwater (&quot;A. gravis&quot;) and the short-tailed shearwater, all blunt-tailed, black-billed species, but its precise relationships are obscure. In any case, these three species are among the larger species of shearwaters that have been moved into a separate genus &quot;Ardenna&quot; based on a phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA.

==Description==

Sooty shearwaters are in length with a wingspan. It has the typical &quot;shearing&quot; flight of the genus, dipping from side to side on stiff wings with few wing beats, the wingtips almost touching the water. Its flight is powerful and direct, with wings held stiff and straight, giving the impression of a very small albatross. This shearwater is identifiable by its dark plumage, which is responsible for its name. In poor viewing conditions, it looks all black, but in good light, it shows as dark chocolate-brown with a silvery strip along the centre of the underwing.

Sooty shearwaters are vocal at night on the breeding grounds, with usually loud coos and croaks. At sea, they are usually silent, though may call when competing for food in large groups.

In the Atlantic, it is the only all-dark large shearwater, though can be confused with the smaller and usually somewhat paler Balearic shearwater at long range; the latter does not have the pale stripe on the underwing. In the Pacific part of its range, other all-dark large shearwaters are found. The short-tailed shearwater in particular is almost impossible to tell apart from the present species at a distance.

==Distribution and habitat==
Sooty shearwaters breed on small islands in two main populations, one in the south Pacific Ocean, mainly around southeast Australia, New Zealand and in the Auckland Islands and Phillip Island off Norfolk Island, and the other in the south Atlantic Ocean on the Falkland Islands, Tierra del Fuego, and Tristan da Cunha. They start breeding in October, and incubate their young for about 54 days. Once the chick hatches, the parents raise their chick for 86 to 109 days.

They are spectacular long-distance migrants, following a circular route, traveling north up the western side of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans at the end of the nesting season in March–May, reaching subarctic waters in June–July, where they cross from west to east, then return south down the eastern side of the oceans in September–October, reaching to the breeding colonies in November. They do not migrate as a flock, but rather as individuals, associating only opportunistically; in June 1906, for example, two were shot near Guadalupe Island off Baja California, Mexico, several weeks before the bulk of the population would pass by. Likewise, the identity of numerous large, dark shearwaters observed in October 2004 off Kwajalein in the Marshall Islands remain enigmatic; they might have been either sooty or short-tailed shearwaters, but neither species is generally held to pass through this region at that time.

In the Atlantic Ocean, they cover distances in excess of from their breeding colony on the Falkland Islands (52°S 60°W) north to 60 to 70°N in the North Atlantic Ocean off north Norway; distances covered in the Pacific are similar or larger; although the Pacific Ocean colonies are not quite so far south, at 35 to 50°S off New Zealand, and moving north to the Aleutian Islands, the longitudinal width of the ocean makes longer migrations necessary. Recent tagging experiments have shown that birds breeding in New Zealand may travel 74,000 km in a year, reaching Japan, Alaska, and California, averaging more than 500 km per day.

In Great Britain, they move south in late August and September; with strong north and north-west winds, they may occasionally become &quot;trapped&quot; in the shallow, largely enclosed North Sea, with passage of a few, or exceptionally up to a thousand birds in a day, may be seen flying back north up the British east coast as they retrace their path back to the Atlantic over northern Scotland.

==Ecology and status==
The sooty shearwater feeds on fish and squid. They can dive up to 68 m deep for food, but more commonly take surface food, in particular often following whales to catch fish disturbed by them. They also follow fishing boats to take fish scraps thrown overboard. Isotopic analyses revealed significant niche overlap between sooty shearwaters and great shearwaters.

They breed in huge colonies and the female lays one white egg, which on average measures 48mm (1.7 in.) in width and 77.5mm (3.1 in.) in length. These shearwaters nest in burrows lined with plant material, which are visited only at night to avoid predation by large gulls and skuas. The architecture of sooty shearwater burrows can vary within and between breeding colonies, and is influenced by competition for breeding space and habitat type, with soil under dense tussac grass being easier to excavate than other substrates.

In New Zealand, about 250,000 chicks are harvested for muttonbird for oils and food each year by the indigenous Māori population. Young birds just about to fledge are collected from the burrows, plucked, and often preserved in salt. In 2022, climate change was thought to be impacting this cultural harvest by Ngāi Tahu.

Its numbers have been declining in recent decades, and it is presently classified as near threatened by the IUCN.

==Inspiration for Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Birds&quot;==

On August 18, 1961, the &quot;Santa Cruz Sentinel&quot; reported that thousands of crazed sooty shearwaters were sighted on the shores of North Monterey Bay in California, regurgitating anchovies, flying into objects, and dying on the streets. The incident sparked the interest of local resident Alfred Hitchcock, along with a story about strange bird behaviour by the British writer Daphne du Maurier, helping to inspire Hitchcock&#x27;s 1963 thriller &quot;The Birds&quot;, a cautionary tale of nature revolting against man. The film is now ranked among the American Film Institute&#x27;s top-10 thrillers of the last century.

Scientists looking at the stomach contents of turtles and seabirds gathered in 1961 Monterey Bay ship surveys found that toxin-making algae were present in 79% of the plankton the creatures ate. &quot;I am pretty convinced that the birds were poisoned,&quot; says ocean environmentalist Sibel Bargu of Louisiana State University. &quot;All the symptoms were extremely similar to later bird poisoning events in the same area.&quot;

Plankton expert Raphael Kudela of USC points to leaky septic tanks installed amid a housing boom around Monterey Bay in the early 1960s as the ultimate culprit that may have fed the toxic algae: &quot;It is to some extent a natural phenomenon, and the best thing we can do is monitor for the presence of toxins, and treat impacted wildlife.&quot;
