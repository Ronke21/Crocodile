<text>Christina Nilsdotter Gyllenstierna of Fogelvik (Swedish: &quot;Kristina&quot; or &quot;Kerstin&quot;: 1494 – January 1559, Hörningsholm Castle) was a Swedish noblewoman. She was married to the Swedish regent Sten Sture the Younger, and led the Swedish resistance against Christian II of Denmark after the death of her spouse. In her own lifetime she was simply referred to as &quot;Fru Kristina&quot; (&#x27;Lady Christina&#x27;), but she has become known in history as &quot;Kristina Gyllenstierna&quot; because of the house of nobility to which she belonged.

== Early life ==
Christina Gyllenstierna was born to &quot;riksråd&quot; Nils Eriksson (Gyllenstierna), Lord of Tullgarn (also written with the Danish spelling Niels Eriksen, and surnamed &quot;Gyllenstjerna&quot; by later historians) and Sigrid Eskilsdotter (Banér) of Venngarn, Heir of Lindholm. She was a great-granddaughter of King Charles VIII of Sweden through her paternal grandmother princess Christina Karlsdotter Bonde (1432-1493/1500), heir of Fogelvik, after whom she was named. Her grandfather Erik Eriksen of Demstrup (&quot;Gyldenstjerne&quot;) originated from Denmark, but during the power struggle between Denmark and Sweden, two formally united parts of the Kalmar Union, he allied with the Swedish claimant, Charles VIII, who made him his son-in-law and High Steward of Charles&#x27; court. By the first marriage of her mother, Christina was the half-sister of Cecilia Månsdotter of Eka and thereby the maternal aunt of the future king Gustav I.

Christina was first engaged to Nils Gädda (d. 1508), governor of Kalmar and Lycka, but the marriage never took place due to his death. On 16 November 1511 in Stockholm, she married the son of the Swedish regent Svante and the nephew of her former betrothed, Sten Sture the Younger. She had six children during her marriage, but only one of them survived to adulthood: 
*Nils (1512–1528), died in childhood
*Iliana (1514–1521), died in early childhood
*Magdalena (1516–1521), died in early childhood
*Svante Stensson Sture (1517–1567)
*Anna (1518–1521), died in early childhood
*Gustav (1519–1520), died in early childhood

==Reign of Sten Sture==
In 1512, Sten Sture succeeded his father as elected regent of Sweden upon his death. During this period, Denmark, Norway and Sweden were formally part of the Kalmar Union through a personal union under the king of Denmark, but in reality, Sweden had been a de facto independent kingdom under &quot;Regents&quot; (Sw. &quot;riksföreståndare&quot;) native high nobles elected to rule the country.

Sten Sture&#x27;s election as regent was not without opposition. At the death of his father, Sten was 18 years old, and High Councillor Eric Trolle, who supported the union with Denmark, was initially chosen as regent by the council. However, Sten utilized the castles and troops granted to him by his late father and took power in a coup: after having promised to continue negotiations with Denmark, the High Council accepted him as regent instead of Trolle. 
In reality, lord Sten&#x27;s purpose was to keep Sweden independent of Denmark. He took the Sture name, heritage from his great-grandmother, because it symbolized independence of Sweden as a reminder of Sten Sture the Elder, his father&#x27;s third cousin.

Regent Sten had already in 1504 been proposed as a candidate in the election of a new king of Sweden as a replacement for John, King of Denmark, who had been elected king of Sweden in 1497 but who was ousted from there in 1502. Upon the death of John in 1513, it was again proposed to elect regent Sten as king of Sweden rather than the son of John, Christian II of Denmark, and Sten was making preparations to arrange an election, including seeking support for it from the pope.

It is considered likely that Christina participated in state affairs and acted as the political adviser to her spouse, given her later role. In reality, Sten and Christina already functioned as king and queen of Sweden: by 1519, Peder Månsson, Bishop of Västerås, expressed his surprise in a letter from Rome to Abbess Anna Germundsdotter of Vadstena Abbey that Sten had not yet been crowned, and in the contemporary Stockholm chronicle, Christina is referred to as &quot;Our Gracious Princess.&quot;
By their ambitions, they became the natural enemies of King Christian II of Denmark, whose ambition it was to be elected king of Sweden and thereby again make Sweden a part of the Kalmar union in practice and not only in name.

Sten became involved in a conflict with archbishop Gustav Trolle, son of his previous rival Eric Trolle. The archbishop claimed more autonomy for the church. In 1516, Sten besieged Staket, the fortress of archbishop Trolle, and when Staket was taken the following year, Sten had the fortress dismantled, Trolle taken captive, imprisoned and deposed as archbishop. The deposition of an archbishop resulted in the excommunication of Sten Sture by the pope, who gave Christian II support in his designs against Sten Sture. On the New Year of 1520, Christian II invaded Sweden.

==Defender of Stockholm==
On 19 January 1520, Regent Sten was mortally wounded at the battle of Bogesund. Lady Christina emerged as the leader of the Sture party and defender of her son&#x27;s right. She took command of the city and Castle of Stockholm in the name of her underage son, and secured support from the majority of the peasantry and burgher class. The commanders of the most important fortresses of the realm pledged their loyalty to her. These were the Västerås Castle, Nyköping Castle, Kalmar Castle as well as the province of Finland. However, she did not manage to secure enough support from the nobility: &quot;Some stated their will to fight for the children of Lord Sten, while one party gave a stern now to Lady Christina the widow of Lord Sten, with the city of Stockholm and those of her followers, and often wrote to them that they should unite and resist the enemy, although such letters were not considered.&quot; On 6 March 1520, several members of the Privy Council of Sweden submitted to Christian II, electing him king of Sweden in Uppsala. The peasantry of central Sweden roused by her patriotism, flew to arms and defeated the Danish invaders at Balundsås on 19 March and were only with the utmost difficulty finally defeated at the bloody battle of Uppsala, on 6 April.

In late May, the Danish fleet arrived and the city of Stockholm was besieged by land and sea by the Danes under Christian II. Shortly before, Christina managed to send her eldest son, the seven year old Nils Stensson Sture to safety in Danzig in Poland with an envoy headed by the chancellor of the Sture family, Peder Jakobsson (Sunnanväder). This was done to issue negotiations with Sigismund I the Old and the Hanseatic League for support against Denmark. In her embassy to Danzig, she stated that she governed the realm until her sons had reached the age of majority and could take over the regency. She had the support from the burghers of Stockholm, who referred to her as their Princess. Lady Christina took command and held out stoutly at Stockholm, while the second stronghold of Sweden, Kalmar, was commanded and defended and by the widow of its governor, Anna Eriksdotter (Bielke), in the same fashion.

On 7 September 1520, after four months of siege, Christina was persuaded to capitulate in exchange for a letter of amnesty. In the letter of amnesty issued by Christian II, an amnesty of the most explicit and absolute character was extracted for Christina herself, her dead spouse and all their followers for all acts of resistance against Christian II himself, his father King John and his grandfather Christian I before him, regardless of all acts against bishop Trolle. Personally, Christina was granted Häme Castle and county, Kuhmo state in Finland, Hörningsholm Castle in Södermanland and Eksjö estate in Småland.

==Stockholm Bloodbath==

On 1 November Christian II was proclaimed King Christian I of Sweden, followed by his coronation in Storkyrkan by the reinstated archbishop Gustav Trolle on 4 September. The coronation was followed by three days of festivities attended by the Swedish nobility, during which he danced with Christina on a ball.

On 7 November, King Christian summoned the Swedish nobility to a meeting in the throne hall at Stockholm Castle. When the meeting was opened, the doors were closed and guarded, and archbishop Trolle accused her, her mother, her late spouse and the followers of Sture for his deposition and demanded compensation and punishment.
Lady Christina stepped forward and pointed out the fact that the deposition of bishop Trolle had been a decision taken by a united parliament: everyone had signed the bill of deposition, placing the responsibility on the entire realm and making it impossible to accuse and punish a particular individual for the act. Furthermore, the amnesty granted by the king as a term for her surrender made it impossible for the king to punish them for their actions against him and his followers.
She stated that there was proof as the protocol from the meeting of 1517, when the removal of Trolle was decided upon, was there: the document with signatures was then presented to the king. Because of the amnesty, the Swedes now considered the matter solved. However, Christian had found a loophole, which the Swedes had overlooked. Previously advised by Didrik Slagheck and Jens Andersen Beldenak not to keep his word to heretics, he stated that the deposition of an archbishop was a crime against the church, and that a monarch had no jurisdiction to pardon anyone for heresy. In effect, this meant that the king could in fact execute the participators in the rebellion against him despite the amnesty, by having them judged by the church for heresy rather than accused of treason by a secular court. This resulted in the infamous Stockholm Bloodbath upon the followers of Sten Sture.

Christina&#x27;s brothers Erik Nilsson, Lord of Tullgarn and Eskil Nilsson, her maternal uncle and her brother-in-law were executed by beheading, as were many other Swedish Sture party followers. Her husband&#x27;s remains were exhumed and burned publicly at the stake as a heretic, as were those of her youngest son Gustav. Her mother Sigrid became the only woman sentenced to be executed: she was sentenced to be drowned, but avoided execution by ceding her property to the king. Christina herself was not executed. King Christian called upon her and asked her to choose which method of execution she preferred, being burned at the stake or being buried alive. Confronted with this choice, she was unable to reply and fainted with horror. Christian was advised to spare her life and neither of these alternatives was carried out. To save her life, she ceded a large part of her property to Christian. 
The king stated that she &quot;is now dead to the world, for she is judged as the others for heresy&quot;.

However, Danish rule in Sweden was threatened by her nephew Gustav Vasa, who soon became the leader of the Swedish War of Liberation. In the spring of 1521, Christina and her half-sister Cecilia (Gustav&#x27;s mother) were forced to write to Gustav Vasa in an attempt to persuade him to surrender to Denmark.

==Denmark==
Christina was held captive at Stockholm Castle until August 1521, after which her children, mother, and finally herself were all transferred to the infamous &quot;Blåtårn&quot; (&quot;Blue Tower&quot;) of Copenhagen Castle along with a large number of other women and children related to the executed of the Stockholm Bloodbath, among them her half sister Cecilia and nieces Emerentia and Margareta. Christina herself and her daughters joined them there in September.

In the chronicle of Per Brahe the Elder, the captivity of the Swedish noblewomen in Denmark were described: &quot;They were much deprived of food and drink [...]. Hardly given enough each day to keep their lives but they worked to be fed&quot;: King Gustav I of Sweden used their treatment in captivity in his propaganda against Christian II and claimed that the Danish monarch starved the women and children who only survived by the mercy showed them by the queen of Denmark, Isabella of Austria. Whatever the truth of this, it is confirmed that many of the imprisoned women and children died, among them Christina&#x27;s daughter Magdalena, half sister Cecilia and niece Emerentia, though the cause of death are given as the plague, at that point used to classify a number of different illnesses. However, one source claims that Christina, in contrast to the other hostages, were not kept prisoner at Blue Tower but in Kalundborg, where she is confirmed to have been at least when the Swedish king later negotiated for her release.

After about two years imprisonment, the political situation changed. In January 1523 Christian II was deposed by Frederick I of Denmark and Christina&#x27;s nephew Gustav I of Sweden took Stockholm from the Danes as the leader of the Swedish War of Liberation and was elected king of an independent kingdom of Sweden. In the summer of 1523, King Gustav applied for her release to Frederick I through the Hanseatic League. At that point, Christina reconciled with bishop Gustav Trolle in Roskilde.

==Power struggle with Gustav I==
In January 1524 Frederick I of Denmark agreed to release the Swedish noblewomen imprisoned at Blue Tower. Christina Gyllenstierna was released and is confirmed to have been in Sweden on 28 January that year: she returned in the company of her mother and her eldest son Nils, while her younger son Svante remained in Denmark to finish his education. On a meeting in Linköping, she reconciled with her former political advisory, bishop Hans Brask.

In summer 1524, King Gustav was informed by the mayor of Rostock and the Danish council that Christina planned to marry Søren Norby, Grand Admiral of Denmark and a follower of the deposed Danish king Christian II, in exchange for Norby using his fleet and military knowledge to help her conquer the Swedish throne for her son. These plans were regarded as a threat both by the new Danish monarch, Frederick I, as well as by King Gustav, and Gustav suspected that she had been led to believe that &quot;she and her children would come to govern the realm&quot; by the help of such a marriage, and that &quot;Lady Christina and her party and followers who attempt to reward, with such evil plots and treason, all the kindness and good acts that we have [...] shown them.&quot;

In March, the first of the Dalecarlian rebellions took place organized by Knut Mickelsson and Christina&#x27;s former chancellor Peder Jakobsson (Sunnanväder), who glorified the reign of the Sture family in contrast to that of Gustav Vasa. The rebels reportedly contacted Søren Norby, who in the same month was promised by Christian II to be his governor in Sweden should he depose King Gustav. In April, Norby was rumored to be on his way to Blekinge with a fleet, after which he launched attacks with his fleet from his base in Gotland. King Gustav sent Berend von Melen, married to his relative Margareta and governor of Kalmar Castle, to fight Norby. However, von Melen broke his loyalty to the king and allied with Søren Norby, a treason for which the king blamed his relative Margareta von Melen. Shortly after, Christina sent her son Nils to von Melen at Kalmar Castle, and it was evidently believed that von Melen would help Nils to unite with Norby. It was speculated abroad that Søren Norby and Berend von Melen would conquer Sweden together as they were &quot;through their wives highly connected&quot; in Sweden. 
At this point, the von Melen couple left for Germany, leaving Nils and a garrison in Kalmar, which was sieged by the troops of Gustav I, while Christina herself seems to have been placed in arrest. In May, the Dalecarlian rebels reproached King Gustav for having imprisoned Christina and having driven her son Nils out of the country and demanded Christina&#x27;s freedom.
On 20 July 1525, however, the rebellion was crushed when Nils, the son of Christina, was taken prisoner by King Gustav after his victory at the Siege of Kalmar. 
When Norby negotiated to submit his loyalty to the new king of Denmark, Frederick I, one of his demands were to secure help from Frederick I to secure Christina&#x27;s release from the prison of Gustav.

In November 1525, Christina and King Gustav I were reconciled in a meeting in Vadstena, where Christina stated that she had never contemplated to marry Søren Norby and that the engagement gifts she sent him were merely gifts of gratitude because he had assisted her and her children from the captivity in Denmark. In a letter from Vadstena on 29 December, she denied ever having contemplated a marriage with Søren Norby. The same month, King Gustav I stated that Christina was to marry his cousin &quot;riksråd&quot; Johan Turesson Tre Rosor, Lord of Falun, riksråd and governor of Nyköping (149?-1556): they were officially engaged at Christmans 1526 and married at Lindholmen Castle, Västergötland, in the summer of 1527. Her second marriage was likely arranged by the king to neutralize Christina politically, as which she would no longer have the prestige of being &quot;The widow of Sten Sture&quot; and leader of the Sture party, but the wife of a loyal relative of the king. From her second marriage, she had a son, Gustaf Johansson. Eric XIV made Svante Count of Vestervik and Stegeholm, and at the same time made Gustaf Count of Enköping (later changed to county of Bogesund).

In the official chronicle of the king, the elder son of Christina, Nils, is claimed to have died the year of his mother&#x27;s remarriage. In 1527, however, the second of the Dalecarlian Rebellions broke out in opposition to Gustav&#x27;s introduction of the Protestant Reformation to Sweden, and the leader of the rebellion was the so-called &quot;Daljunkern&quot; (&#x27;The youngster from Dalarna&#x27;), who claimed to be Nils Sture, the 15-year-old elder son of Christina. Modern research indicate that &quot;Daljunkern&quot; was indeed Nils, the son of Christina. Gustav defeated the rebels, and Daljunkern fled to Norway and then Germany, where he was arrested in Rostock. In August 1528, King Gustav had Christina issue an official statement that Daljunkern was not her son.
In order to have the Daljunkern executed, Gustav I had Christina write a statement in which she stated that of all the sons she had with regent Sten, the only son alive was Svante. Preserved documents show that the first version of Christina&#x27;s letter was written carefully and only asked the authorities in Rostock to send the person claiming to be Nils to Sweden for questioning: in the final version of the letter, which was eventually sent, however, she called him a thief and impostor and demanded that he be executed on the spot. It is considered likely that she wrote the letter under pressure.

==Later life==
The relationship between Christina and King Gustav was described as somewhat tense. After the death of her mother in 1527, Christina and Gustav came to be involved in a conflict over her inheritance after her mother, which was not solved until 1550. 
During the Westrogothian rebellion in 1529, Christina was given the task by the king to negotiate with her rebellious brother-in-law Jöran Turesson (Tre Rosor).
During the Dacke War, the king ordered her that she should prevent any rebels who reached Nyköping to acquire supplies and imprison them.

Her second son Svante was, according to tradition, engaged to her relative Margaret Leijonhufvud, who however was arranged to marry the king in 1536. After the marriage of Margaret to the king, Christina and other relatives of the new queen were granted some privileges, such as the right to some of the money from the fines paid to the crown. It is noted that she evidently attended court during the tenure of Margaret as queen, as she, alongside Margaret&#x27;s mother Ebba Eriksdotter Vasa, is often listed to have occupied the best rooms next to the queen. Whether she was ever given a court office is unknown. It is confirmed that she was briefly made responsible for the court of the royal children between the death of queen Margaret in 1551 and the king&#x27;s marriage to queen Katarina Stenbock in 1552. Christina died in January 1559 at Hörningsholm Castle.

<text>Sandown is a seaside resort and civil parish on the south-east coast of the Isle of Wight, England. The neighbouring resort of Shanklin and the settlement of Lake are sited just to the south of the town. Sandown has a population of 11,654 according to the 2021 Census, and the three Sandown Bay settlements form a built-up area of more than 20,000 inhabitants. Sandown is the Bay&#x27;s northernmost town, with its easily accessible, sandy beaches running continuously from the cliffs below Battery Gardens in the south to Yaverland in the north.

== History ==
There is some evidence for a pre-Roman settlement in the area. During the Roman period, it was a site of salt production.

Before the 19th century, Sandown was on the map chiefly for its military significance, with the Bay&#x27;s beaches feared to offer easy landing spots for invaders from the Continent.

It is the site of the lost Sandown Castle. While undergoing construction in 1545, the fortification was attacked during the French invasion of the Isle of Wight when invaders fought their way over Culver Down from Whitecliff Bay before being repelled. The castle was built into the sea, prone to erosion and demolished fewer than a hundred years after it was built. In 1631, the castle was replaced by Sandham Fort, built further inland. In 1781, the fort&#x27;s complement consisted of a master gunner and over twenty soldiers. Sandham Fort was demolished in the mid-19th century and is now the site of Sandham Gardens.

In the 1860s, five Palmerston Forts were built along the coast of Sandown Bay, including Granite Fort at Yaverland, now the Wildheart Animal Sanctuary. On the town&#x27;s western cliffs Sandown Barrack Battery survives as a scheduled monument and Bembridge Fort, where the National Trust offers tours, can be seen on the downs to the north-east.

One of the first non-military buildings was Sandham Cottage or &#x27;Villakin&#x27;, a holiday home leased by the radical politician and one-time Mayor of London John Wilkes in the final years of the 18th century. See &#x27;Sandown&#x27;s famous connections&#x27; below.

The arrival of the railway in 1864 saw Sandown grow as a Victorian resort, with the town&#x27;s safe bathing becoming increasingly popular. In the summer of 1874, the Crown Prince Frederick and Princess Victoria of Germany, their children and entourage rented several properties in the town and took regular dips in the Bay. Sandown&#x27;s pier was built in the same decade, opening in May 1878, and extended in length in 1895.
The town laid further claim to becoming a fashionable English resort when the Ocean Hotel opened in 1899. The brainchild of West End theatrical impresario Henry Lowenfeld, the Ocean built around the town&#x27;s previous hotel of choice, the King&#x27;s Head. For the new hotel&#x27;s inauguration, a large number of dignitaries were invited from London, arriving in Sandown from Portsmouth by special boat. Guests had the chance to explore Sandown in coaches and carriages, and the hotel servants were all dressed in uniforms &#x27;like admirals and post-captains&#x27;.

Sandown&#x27;s destiny in the 20th century was to become a favourite bucket-and-spade destination for all classes. The Canoe Lake was opened in 1929 by the author Henry De Vere Stacpoole followed in 1932 by Brown&#x27;s Golf Course (see below). The Art Deco Grand Hotel, opened next door to Brown&#x27;s in April 1938, is now closed with planning permission for demolition granted in 2014.

Today, Sandown&#x27;s esplanade has a mixture of former Victorian and Edwardian hotels with modern counterparts overlooking the beach and the Bay. A new Premier Inn opened in 2021. 

The original Sandown Pier was opened in 1878 and extended to its present length in 1895. The Pier Pavilion Theatre closed in the 1990s and the pier&#x27;s former landing stage is used for sea fishing today.

Further north is the Wildheart Animal Sanctuary, formerly Isle of Wight Zoo. Established as Sandown Zoo in the 1950s, it was acquired by the Corney family in the 1970s; today, it specialises in rescued tigers, other big cats and primates. Nearby is the purpose-built Dinosaur Isle palaeontology centre, which opened in 2001, and Sandham Gardens, which offers a dinosaur miniature golf course, attractions for children and young people, and bowls.

===HMS &quot;Eurydice&quot;===

On 24 March 1878, the Royal Navy training ship HMS &quot;Eurydice&quot; capsized and sank in Sandown Bay with the loss of 317 lives, one of Britain&#x27;s worst peacetime naval disasters. The tops of the vessel&#x27;s sunken masts were still visible from Sandown two months later, on the day the town&#x27;s pier was opened.

The ship was re-floated in August and beached at Yaverland to be pumped out, the subject of a painting by Henry Robins (1820-1892) for Queen Victoria who came over from Osborne House with other members of her family to see the wreck.

There is a memorial to crew of the &quot;Eurydice&quot; in the graveyard of Christ Church, Sandown.

== Geography ==
The town is surrounded by natural features that form part of the Isle of Wight Biosphere Reserve designated by UNESCO&#x27;s Man and the Biosphere Programme in June 2019. The area features walks along the Isle of Wight Coastal Path.

The bay that gives Sandown its name is an example of a concordant coastline, with of tidal beaches from Luccombe to Culver replenished by longshore drift. Sandown Bay has one of the longest unbroken beaches in the British Isles.

To the north-east is Culver Down, mostly owned and managed by the National Trust. It supports typical chalk downland wildlife, and seabirds and birds of prey which nest on the cliffs.

Nearby is the flood plain of the Eastern Yar, one of the few freshwater wetlands on the Isle of Wight, where Alverstone Mead Local Nature Reserve is popular for birdwatching. Sandown Meadows Nature Reserve, acquired by the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust in 2012, is a place to spot kingfishers and water voles. Further inland, Borthwood Copse provides woodland walks, with many bluebells in the Spring.

The area&#x27;s marine sub-littoral zone, including the reefs and seabed, is a Special Area of Conservation. At extreme low tide, a petrified forest may be revealed in the northern part of the bay, and fragments of petrified wood are often washed up.

==Town Hall==

Commissioned by the local board of health in 1869, the Grade II listed Sandown Town Hall is in Grafton Street. In March 2021, the Isle of Wight Council granted planning permission to convert the building for housing and subsequently decided to dispose of the Town Hall while exploring opportunities for community use. In 2022, paint samples found evidence of the celebrated multi-coloured ceiling decorated by Henry Tooth in 1873, hidden for many decades beneath layers of 20th century paint. In 2023, government funding was announced to renovate parts of the Town Hall for youth and community services.

==Brown&#x27;s golf course==

Designed by one of the UK&#x27;s leading players of the time, Henry Cotton, the Brown&#x27;s pitch and putt courses were the idea of south London pie and sausage maker Alex Kennedy. Opened on Sandown&#x27;s eastern sea front in March 1932, the original clubhouse had the motto &quot;Golf for Everybody&quot; emblazoned on its roof. Brown&#x27;s and its ice cream factory were reportedly adapted in the 1940s to disguise pumping apparatus for Pipeline Under the Ocean (PLUTO) intended to deliver oil to the D-Day beaches. A conservation management plan for the site was published in July 2020.

==Events==

The town&#x27;s summer carnival has existed since 1889. Today, Sandown Carnival Association puts on a series of events including the Children&#x27;s Carnival and Illuminated Carnival, Sandown Bay Regatta, and New Year&#x27;s Day Celebrations with a fireworks display. Arts Council England funding was received in 2023 and 2024 to revive the town&#x27;s tradition of wearing hats on Regatta day.

==Amenities==

Sandown offers an assortment of restaurants, cafes, bars and pubs along the seafront and in the town.
Sandown Pier is a popular attraction for amusements and refreshments, and there are new cafes and eating places along the seafront promenade towards Lake and Shanklin. 

&quot;Boojum and Snark&quot; at 105 High Street opened in 2019 as a venue for art exhibitions and community events, with its name inspired by author Lewis Carroll who stayed across the road in the 1870s.

==Transport==

Sandown railway station is a stop on the Island Line, the Isle of Wight&#x27;s one remaining public railway line from Ryde Pier Head to . Services are operated by South Western Railway.

Sandown is served by buses run by Southern Vectis with direct services to Bembridge, Newport, Ryde, Shanklin and Ventnor. Night buses run on Fridays and Saturdays.

==Media location==
The UK group Take That filmed the video for their fifth single &quot;I Found Heaven&quot; on Sandown&#x27;s beaches and sea front in 1992.

Sandown High School and locations nearby were used in the 1972 film &quot;That&#x27;ll Be The Day&quot; starring David Essex, Ringo Starr, Billy Fury and Rosemary Leach.

The TV series &quot;Tiger Island&quot;, on ITV and National Geographic in 2007 and 2008, chronicled the lives of the more than twenty tigers living at Isle of Wight Zoo.

Sandown featured in the Channel 5 series &quot;Isle of Wight: Jewel of the South&quot;, shown in the UK in 2023 and 2024.

<text>Christian socialism is a religious and political philosophy that blends Christianity and socialism, endorsing socialist economics on the basis of the Bible and the teachings of Jesus. Many Christian socialists believe capitalism to be idolatrous and rooted in the sin of greed. Christian socialists identify the cause of social inequality to be the greed that they associate with capitalism. Christian socialism became a major movement in the United Kingdom beginning in the 19th century. The Christian Socialist Movement, known as Christians on the Left since 2013, is one formal group, as well as a faction of the Labour Party.

According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, socialism is a &quot;social and economic doctrine that calls for public rather than private ownership or control of property and natural resources. According to the socialist view, individuals do not live or work isolated, but live in cooperation with one another. Furthermore, everything that people produce is in some sense a social product, and everyone who contributes to the production of a good is entitled to a share in it. Society as a whole, therefore, should own or at least control property for the benefit of all its members. ... Early Christian communities also practised the sharing of goods and labour, a simple form of socialism subsequently followed in certain forms of monasticism. Several monastic orders continue these practices today.&quot;

The Hutterites believe in strict adherence to biblical principles and church discipline, and practices common ownership of nearly all property, resembling a form of communism to secular observers. In the words of historians Max Stanton and Rod Janzen, the Hutterites &quot;established in their communities a rigorous system of Ordnungen, which were codes of rules and regulations that governed all aspects of life and ensured a unified perspective. As an economic system, Christian communism was attractive to many of the peasants who supported social revolution in sixteenth century central Europe&quot;, such as the German Peasants&#x27; War, and Friedrich Engels came to view Anabaptists as proto-communists.

Other earlier figures viewed as Christian socialists include the 19th-century writers F. D. Maurice (&quot;The Kingdom of Christ&quot;, 1838), John Malcolm Forbes Ludlow (&quot;The Christian Socialist&quot;, 1850), Adin Ballou (&quot;Practical Christian Socialism&quot;, 1854), Thomas Hughes (&quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot;, 1857), John Ruskin (&quot;Unto This Last&quot;, 1862), Charles Kingsley (&quot;The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby&quot;, 1863), Frederick James Furnivall (co-creator of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;), and Francis Bellamy (a Baptist minister and the author of the Pledge of Allegiance in the United States).
== History ==
=== Biblical age ===
Elements that would form the basis of Christian socialism are found in the Old Testament, as well as the New Testaments. They include , , , , , , , , , , , , , and .

==== Old Testament ====
The Old Testament had divided perspectives on the issue of poverty. One part of the Biblical tradition held that poverty was judgment of God upon the wicked while viewing prosperity as a reward for the good, stating in the that &quot;[t]he righteous have enough to satisfy their appetite, but the belly of the wicked is empty.&quot; There are other sections that instruct generosity to the have-nots of society. Mosaic Law instructs followers to treat neighbours equally and to be generous to have-nots.


Some of the Psalms include many references to social justice for the poor.

Amos emphasizes the need for justice and righteousness that is described as conduct that emphasizes love for those who are poor and to oppose oppression and injustice towards the poor. The prophet Isaiah, to whom is attributed the first thirty-nine chapters of the Book of Isaiah known as Proto-Isaiah, followed upon Amos&#x27; themes of justice and righteousness involving the poor as necessary for followers of God, denouncing those who do not do these things.
The Book of Sirach, one of the deuterocanonical or biblical apocrypha books of the Old Testament, denounces the pursuit of wealth.
==== New Testament ====

The teachings of Jesus are frequently described as socialist, especially by Christian socialists, such as Terry Eagleton. records that in the early church in Jerusalem &quot;[n]o one claimed that any of their possessions was their own&quot;; this pattern, which helped Christians survive after the siege of Jerusalem, was taken seriously for several centuries, and was an important factor in the rise of feudalism. While it would later disappear from church history except within monasticism, it experienced a revival since the 19th century. Christian socialism was one of the founding threads of the Labour Party in the United Kingdom and is said to begin with the uprising of Wat Tyler and John Ball in the 14th century.

In the New Testament, Jesus identifies himself with the hungry, the poor, the sick, and the prisoners. Matthew 25:31–46 is a major component of Christianity and is considered the cornerstone of Christian socialism. Another key statement in the New Testament that is an important component of Christian socialism is Luke 10:25–37 that follows the statement &quot;You shall love your neighbour as yourself&quot; with the question &quot;And who is my neighbour?&quot; In the Parable of the Good Samaritan. Jesus gives the response that the neighbour includes anyone in need, even people we might be expected to shun. The Samaritans and Jews claim descension from different Tribes of Israel, which had faced a schism prior to the events described in the New Testament. This schism led to interethnic and interreligious conflict between the two groups.

Luke 6:20–21 shows Jesus narrating the Sermon on the Plain. It reads: &quot;Blessed are you poor, for yours is the kingdom of God. Blessed are you that hunger now, for you shall be satisfied.&quot; Christian socialists cite James the Just, the brother of Jesus, who criticizes the rich intensely and in strong language in the Epistle of James.
During the New Testament period and beyond, there is evidence that many Christian communities practised forms of sharing, redistribution, and communism. Some of the Bible verses that inspired the communal economic arrangements of the Hutterites are found in the book of the Acts.


=== Church Fathers age ===
Basil of Caesarea, the Church Father of the Eastern monks who became Bishop of Caesarea, established a complex (later called Basileias) around the church and monastery that included hostels, almshouses, and hospitals for infectious diseases. During the great famine of 368, Basil denounced against profiteers and the indifferent rich. Basil wrote a sermon on the Parable of the Rich Fool in which he states:
John Chrysostom declared his reasons for his attitude towards the rich and position of attitude towards wealth. He said:
=== Early modern period ===
During the English Civil War and the period of the Commonwealth of England (1642–1660), the Diggers espoused a political and economic theory rooted in Christianity that bears a strong resemblance to modern socialism, particularly its anarchist and communist strains. Some scholars believe the Munster Rebellion may have formed an early socialist state.

=== 19th century to present ===
In &quot;Religion and the Rise of Socialism&quot;, historian Eric Hobsbawn argued that the &quot;modern working-class socialist movement has developed an overwhelmingly secular, indeed often militantly anti-religious ideology.&quot; At the same time, he and other historians cited examples where this was not the case, particularly Britain in the 19th and 20th centuries, where E. P. Thompson and Stephen Yo said a form of ethical socialism dominated the labour movement. A prominent example of Christian socialism, or socialist Christianity, was Keir Hardie, a founder of the Labour Party in Britain, who said he learnt his &quot;Socialism in the New Testament&quot;, where he said he found what he described as his &quot;chief inspiration&quot;. Those socialists argued that socialism was the embodiment of the teachings of Jesus, and that it would also rescue the church from Mammon, which they said caused it to have lost its way and become corrupt by siding with the rich and powerful against the poor. According to this view, socialism was not anti-religion but was opposed to those who would use it to support capitalism and the &quot;status quo&quot;. James Connolly is credited with setting the groundwork for Christian socialism in Ireland. Connolly, who wrote a story for the Christian socialist journal &quot;Labour Prophet&quot;, said: &quot;It is not Socialism but Capitalism that is opposed to religion ... when the organised Socialist working class tramples upon the Capitalist Class it will not be trampling on a pillar of God&#x27;s Church but upon a blasphemous defiler of the Sanctuary, it will be rescuing the faith from the impious vermin who make it noisome to the really religious men and women.&quot;

In France, Philippe Buchez began to characterize his philosophy as Christian socialism in the 1820s and 1830s. A variety of socialist perspectives emerged in 19th-century Britain, beginning with John Ruskin. Edward R. Norman identifies what he describes as the three &quot;immediate intellectual sources&quot; for mid-century Christian socialism: Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Thomas Carlyle, and Thomas Arnold. The United States also has a Christian socialist tradition. In Utah, it developed and flourished in the first part of the 20th century, playing an important part in the development and expression of radicalism. Part of a larger, nationwide movement in many American Protestant churches, Christian socialism in Utah was particularly strong, and dedicated Christian socialist ministers, such as Episcopal Church bishop Franklin Spencer Spalding of Utah and Congregational minister Myron W. Reed in the American West, were fierce advocates for the miners laboring in the Mountain states.

==== John Ruskin ====
The influential Victorian era art critic John Ruskin expounded theories about social justice in &quot;Unto This Last&quot; (1860). In it, he stated four goals that might be called socialist even though Ruskin did not use the term.
# &quot;[T]raining schools for youth, established at government cost.&quot;
# In connection with these schools, the government should establish &quot;manufactories and workshops, for the production and sale of every necessary of life.&quot;
# All unemployed people should be &quot;set to work&quot; or trained for work if needed or forced to work if necessary.
# &quot;[F]or the old and destitute, comfort and home should be provided.&quot;

Although Norman says Ruskin was not &quot;an authentic Socialist in any of its various nineteenth-century meanings&quot;, as his only real contact with the Christian socialists came through the Working Men&#x27;s College, he influenced later socialist thinking, especially the artist William Morris.

==== Artists ====
The painters of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood were influenced and sponsored by Ruskin. Morris was a leader of the Socialist League founded in December 1884.

==== Fabian Society ====
The Fabian Society was founded in 1884, with Beatrice Webb and Sydney Webb being among its leading members. The Fabians influenced members of the Bloomsbury Group and were important in the early history of the Labour Party in the United Kingdom.

===== Episcopal Church Socialist League and Church League for Industrial Democracy =====
Founded by Vida Dutton Scudder in 1911, herself influenced by the Fabian Society, the Episcopal Church Socialist League and its successor, the Church League for Industrial Democracy, sought to ally Christian doctrine with the plight of the working class as a part of the larger social gospel movement that was taking hold of many urban churches across the United States in the early 20th century.

In the November 1914 issue of &quot;The Christian Socialist&quot;, Spalding stated:
==== Christian anarchism ====

Although anarchists have traditionally been skeptical of or vehemently opposed to organized religion, some anarchists have provided religious interpretations and approaches to anarchism, including the idea that glorification of the state is a form of sinful idolatry. Christian anarchists say anarchism is inherent in Christianity and the Gospels, that it is grounded in the belief that there is only one source of authority to which Christians are ultimately answerable—the authority of God as embodied in the teachings of Jesus. It therefore rejects the idea that human governments have ultimate authority over human societies. Christian anarchists denounce the state, believing it is violent, deceitful, and idolatrous when glorified.

The foundation of Christian anarchism is a rejection of violence, with Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;The Kingdom of God Is Within You&quot; regarded as a key text. Tolstoy sought to separate Russian Orthodox Christianity—which was merged with the state—from what he believed was the true message of Jesus as contained in the Gospels, specifically in the Sermon on the Mount. Tolstoy takes the Christian pacifist viewpoint that all governments who wage war, and churches who in turn support those governments, are an affront to the Christian principles of nonviolence and nonresistance. Although Tolstoy never used &quot;Christian anarchism&quot; in &quot;The Kingdom of God Is Within You&quot;, reviews of this book following its publication in 1894 appear to have coined the term.

Christian anarchists hold that the Reign of God is the proper expression of the relationship between God and humanity. Under the Reign of God, human relationships would be characterized by divided authority, servant leadership, and universal compassion—not by the hierarchical, authoritarian structures that are normally attributed to religious social order. Most Christian anarchists are pacifists who reject war and the use of violence. More than any other Bible source, the Sermon on the Mount is used as the basis for Christian anarchism. Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;The Kingdom of God Is Within You&quot; is often regarded as a key text for modern Christian anarchism.

Critics of Christian anarchism include both Christians and anarchists. Christians often cite Romans 13 as evidence that the state should be obeyed, while secular anarchists do not believe in any authority including God as per the slogan &quot;no gods, no masters&quot;. Christian anarchists often believe Romans 13 is taken out of context, emphasizing that Revelation 13 and Isaiah 13, among other passages, are needed to fully understand Romans 13 text.

==== Christian communism ====
Christian communism is a form of religious communism based on Christianity and the view that the teachings of Jesus compel Christians to support communism as the ideal social system. While there is no universal agreement on the exact date when Christian communism was founded, Christian communists say that evidence from the Bible suggests that the first Christians, including the Apostles in the New Testament as described in the Acts, established their own communist society in the years following Jesus&#x27; death and resurrection.

Advocates of Christian communism, including other communists, such as Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, and Karl Kautsky, argue that it was taught by Jesus and practised by the apostles themselves. This is generally agreed by historians. The link was highlighted in one of Marx&#x27;s early writings, which stated that &quot;[a]s Christ is the intermediary unto whom man unburdens all his divinity, all his religious bonds, so the state is the mediator unto which he transfers all his Godlessness, all his human liberty.&quot;

==== Christian democracy ====
The political movement of Christian democracy espouses some values of Christian socialism in the form of economic justice and social welfare. It opposes an individualist worldview and approves state intervention in the economy in defence of human dignity. Because of its close association with Catholicism, Christian democracy differs from Christian socialism by its emphasis on traditional church and family values, its defence of private property, and by its opposition to excessive state intervention.

Salvatore Talamo, a neo-Thomistic sociologist and Catholic social theorist, when distinguishing between the conservative and Christian democratic views on labour issues, used &quot;Christian Socialists&quot; for the latter; most Christian democrats avoid using &quot;socialism&quot;, which is occasionally mainly used by conservatives who attempt to discredit their Christian democratic opponents by using a word with Marxist connotations. Christian democratic parties under various names were formed in Europe and Latin America after World War II. Some, such as in Germany and Italy, became a major political force.

==== Liberation theology ====
Liberation theology is a synthesis of Christian theology and socio-economic analyses that emphasizes &quot;social concern for the poor and political liberation for oppressed peoples&quot;, as well as &quot;the oppressed and maimed and blind and lame&quot;, and bring the &quot;good news to the poor&quot;. Beginning in the 1960s after the Second Vatican Council, it became the political praxis of Latin American liberation theologians, such as Gustavo Gutiérrez, Leonardo Boff, and Jesuits like Juan Luis Segundo and Jon Sobrino, who popularized the phrase &quot;preferential option for the poor&quot;. This expression was used first by Jesuit Father General Pedro Arrupe in 1968, and the World Synod of Catholic Bishops in 1971 chose as its theme &quot;Justice in the World&quot; for the Second Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops.

The Latin American context produced evangelical advocates of liberation theology, such as Rubem Alves, José Míguez Bonino, and C. René Padilla, who called for integral mission in the 1970s, emphasizing evangelism and social responsibility. Theologies of liberation have developed in other parts of the world, such as black theology in the United States and South Africa, Palestinian liberation theology, Dalit theology in India, and Minjung theology in South Korea.

== In Catholicism ==

Communism and socialism have been condemned by Pope Pius IX, Pope Leo XIII, Pope Pius X, Pope Benedict XV, Pope Pius XI, Pope Pius XII, Pope John XXIII, Pope Paul VI, and Pope John Paul II. Many of these popes, Leo XIII and Pius XI in particular, have also condemned unregulated capitalism. Pope Benedict XVI condemned both ideologies, while distinguishing them from democratic socialism, which he praised. The views of Pope Francis on the issue have also been called into question, with some arguing he holds socialist or communist views, while others argue he does not. Pope Francis has denied accusations of him being a communist, including by &quot;The Economist&quot;, calling them a &quot;misinterpretation&quot; of his views. In 2016, Francis criticized Marxist ideology as wrong but praised communists for &quot;[thinking] like Christians&quot;.

=== 19th century ===
Pope Pius IX criticized socialism in his works &quot;Nostis et nobiscum&quot; and &quot;Quanta cura&quot;. In his 1849 work &quot;Nostis et nobiscum&quot;, he referred to communism and socialism as &quot;wicked theories&quot; that confuse people with what he called &quot;perverted teachings&quot;. In his 1864 work &quot;Quanta cura&quot;, he referred to communism and socialism as a &quot;fatal error&quot;. Communism was later further criticized in the 1878 papal encyclical &quot;Quod apostolici muneris&quot;, by Pope Leo XIII, as he believed that it led to state domination over the freedom of the individual and quelled proper religious worship, inherently turning the top hierarchical power over to the state instead of God. Leo said in this work that socialists steal &quot;the very Gospel itself with a view to deceive more easily the unwary ... [and] distort it so as to suit their own purposes.&quot; In the words of academic Catherine Ruth Pakaluk, who refers to the reigns of Pope Pius IX to Pope Pius XII (1850–1950) as the Leonine era, &quot;socialism and communism appear so often in the papal texts of the Leonine era, and with such importance, that they might be described as central foils over and against which the Church is defined and refined over time.&quot;

In his 1891 encyclical &quot;Rerum novarum&quot;, Pope Leo XIII said that socialism acts against natural injustice and destroys the home. He wrote that materialist socialism &quot;must be utterly rejected&quot; by Catholics. Leo XIII strongly criticized capitalism. According to historian Eamon Duffy, it was revolutionary in that, as recounted by theologian Paul Misner, up until that point, the Vatican was allied with reactionary institutions and monarchies, and it was the first major statement of the old institutions to discuss the realities of 19th-century society and endorse the working class&#x27;s grievances. In the words of Duffy, &quot;For the successor of Pio Nono to say these things ... was truly revolutionary. Leo&#x27;s attack on unrestriced capitalism, his insistence on the duty of state intervention on behalf of the worker, his assertion of the right to a living wage and the rights of organised labour, changed the terms of all future Catholic discussions on social questions, and gave weight and authority to more adventurous advocates of Social Catholicism.&quot;

Many Catholics and non-Catholics used the &quot;Christian socialists&quot; label for those who wanted to put &quot;Rerum novarum&quot; into practice. The Knights of Saint Columbanus can trace its origins back to &quot;Rerum novarum&quot;. The labour movement in Ireland and the United States traces its origins back to Roman Catholicism and the 1891 encyclical &quot;Rerum novarum&quot; and the various subsequent encyclicals it spawned. The Starry Plough, a symbol associated with socialism in Ireland, was designed with an explicit reference to Catholicism in mind. The right to association, such as the creation of and involvement in trade unions and co-operatives, are regarded as a core part of Roman Catholic social teaching.

=== 20th century ===
In 1901, Leo XIII in his encyclical &quot;Graves de communi re&quot; referred to socialism as a &quot;harvest of misery&quot;. In 1910, Pope Pius X criticized socialism in his Apostolic letter &quot;Notre charge apostolique&quot;, predicting that the rise of socialism will be &quot;a tumultuous agitation&quot;. In 1914, Pope Benedict XV wrote his encyclical, &quot;Ad beatissimi Apostolorum&quot;, which reaffirmed the anti-socialist stance of the Catholic Church, calling on Catholics to remember &quot;the errors of Socialism and of similar doctrines&quot;, as taught by his predecessors.

In 1931, Pope Pius XI wrote his work &quot;Quadragesimo anno&quot;, wherein Pius described the major dangers for human freedom and dignity arising from unrestrained capitalism and totalitarian communism. Pius XI called upon true socialism to distance itself from totalitarian communism as a matter of clarity and also as a matter of principle. Communists were accused of attempting to overthrow all existing civil society. It was argued that Christian socialism, if allied to communism, was deemed to be an oxymoron because of this. At the time, Pius XI famously wrote: &quot;Religious socialism, Christian socialism, are contradictory terms; no one can be at the same time a good Catholic and a true socialist.&quot;

Some prominent Catholic socialists existed during Pope Pius XI&#x27;s era, including the American anarchist Dorothy Day who advocated for distributism and the Irish priest Michael O&#x27;Flanagan who was suspended for his political beliefs. In 1931, it was clarified that a Catholic was free to vote for the Labour Party, the British affiliate of the Socialist International. Later in 1937, Pius XI rejected atheistic communism in an encyclical entitled &quot;Divini Redemptoris&quot; as &quot;a system full of errors and sophisms&quot;, with a &quot;pseudo-ideal of justice, equality, and fraternity&quot; and &quot;a certain false mysticism&quot;, and contrasted it with a humane society (&quot;civitas humana&quot;).

In 1949, Pope Pius XII issued the Decree against Communism, which declared Catholics who professed communist doctrine to be excommunicated as apostates from the Christian faith. In 1952, when referring to socialism, Pius XII stated: &quot;The Church will fight this battle to the end, for it is a question of supreme values: the dignity of man and the salvation of souls.&quot; In 1959, on the question of whether Catholics could &quot;associate themselves with the communists and support them with their course of action&quot;, a response from the Holy Office under Pope John XXIII replied: &quot;No.&quot; On 15 May 1961, John XXIII promulgated the encyclical &quot;Mater et magistra&quot;, which reaffirmed the Church&#x27;s anti-socialist stances. John XXIII wrote:

Nonetheless, Pope John XXIII helped the Christian Democracy party to cooperate with the Italian Socialist Party, as part of the Catholic open up to the left.

In Chile, many Catholics supported the democratic president Salvador Allende, and a group of Catholic priests and faithful founded the group Christians for Socialism, which supported the president and argued that socialism is closer to Catholic values than capitalism. In a meeting organized by the group in April 1972 attended by over 400 Catholic priests and nuns, the participants issued a declaration calling for official Catholic support for socialism, argued that Christians are obliged to involve themselves in the revolutionary process, and called for class struggle. The group also cited the words of Chilean papal prelate Raúl Silva Henríquez, who stated: &quot;There are more of the Gospel&#x27;s values in socialism than there are in capitalism.&quot; In May 1971, Chilean bishops released a pastoral letter &quot;The Gospel, Politics, and Socialisms&quot; (), which stated that while the Catholic Church could not endorse a specific political ideology, socialism is not incompatible with Catholic teaching and might be seen as a direct application of Catholic principles. At the same time, Chilean bishops warned that Catholics must reject variants of socialism that are based on atheism or a materialistic view of history, as these were elements incompatible with the teaching of the Church.

In 1971, Pope Paul VI wrote the Apostolic Letter, &quot;Octogesima adveniens&quot;. About Christians and socialism, he wrote: &quot;Too often Christians attracted by socialism tend to idealize it in terms which, apart from anything else, are very general: a will for justice, solidarity and equality. They refuse to recognize the limitations of the historical socialist movements, which remain conditioned by the ideologies from which they originated.&quot; Pope John Paul II criticized socialism in his 1991 encyclical &quot;Centesimus annus&quot;. He wrote:

The 1992 &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;, also promulgated by Pope John Paul II, condemns socialism as an atheistic ideology. Paragraph 2425 states:

=== 21st century ===
In 2004, Joseph Ratzinger, the future Pope Benedict XVI, addressed the Italian Senate, declaring that &quot;[i]n many respects democratic socialism was and is close to Catholic social doctrine; in any case, it contributed toward the formation of a social consciousness.&quot; In 2005, Benedict XVI in his encyclical &quot;Deus caritas est&quot; stated: &quot;We do not need a State which regulates and controls everything, but a State which, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, generously acknowledges and supports initiatives arising from the different social forces and combines spontaneity with closeness to those in need. The Church is one of those living forces. ... In the end, the claim that just social structures would make works of charity superfluous masks a materialist conception of man ... a conviction that demeans man and ultimately disregards all that is specifically human.&quot; In 2007, Benedict XVI criticized Karl Marx in his encyclical &quot;Spe salvi&quot;, stating that &quot;[w]ith the victory of the revolution, though, Marx&#x27;s fundamental error also became evident. He showed precisely how to overthrow the existing order, but he did not say how matters should proceed thereafter. ... He forgot that freedom always remains also freedom for evil. He thought that once the economy had been put right, everything would automatically be put right. His real error is materialism: man, in fact, is not merely the product of economic conditions, and it is not possible to redeem him purely from the outside by creating a favourable economic environment.&quot;

Pope Francis has been viewed as having some sympathy to socialist causes, with his frequent criticism of capitalism and of neoliberalism. In 2016, Francis said that the world economy is &quot;[f]undamental terrorism, against all of Humanity&quot;, and that &quot;[i]f anything, it is the communists who think like Christians. Christ spoke of a society where the poor, the weak and the marginalized have the right to decide.&quot; When later questioned on whether or not he is a communist, Francis responded: &quot;As for whether or not I&#x27;m a communist: I am sure that I have not said anything more than what the Church&#x27;s social doctrine teaches ... maybe the impression of being a little more &#x27;of the left&#x27; has been given, but that would be a misinterpretation.&quot; In 2013, he said: &quot;The ideology of Marxism is wrong. But I have met many Marxists in my life who are good people, so I don&#x27;t feel offended.&quot;

Movements like liberation theology argue for the compatibility of socialism and Catholicism; they have been rejected by Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI. António Guterres, a practicing Catholic and Secretary-General of the United Nations since 2017, is the immediate past president of the Socialist International.

== In Calvinism ==
=== Australia ===
In Australia, the academic Roland Boer has attempted to synthesize Calvinism and Marxism. In a 2010 interview, he stated that &quot;it became clear to me that within Christianity there is a strong tradition of political and theological radicalism, which I continued to explore personally. Reformed or Calvinist theology did not seem to sit easily with that interest, so I spent many a long year rejecting that tradition, only to realise later that Calvin himself was torn between the radical potential of elements in the Bible and his own conservative preferences.&quot;

=== France ===
In France, the birthplace of Calvinism, the &quot;Christianisme Social&quot; (Social Christianity) movement emerged in the 1870s from the preaching of Tommy Fallot. Early on, the movement focused on such issues as illiteracy and alcoholism amongst the poor. After the First World War, Social Christianity moved in two directions — towards pacifism and towards ecumenism. Within the movement emerged conscientious objectors, such as Jacques Martin, Philo Vernier, and Henri Roser, economists pursuing policies that reflected cooperation and solidarity, such as Bernard Lavergne and Georges Lasserre, and theologians like Paul Ricoeur. One of the pastors in the movement, Jacques Kaltenbach, was also to have a formative influence on André Trocmé.

Under the Vichy regime, which had seen the emergence of other forms of witness, particularly the support of internees in the camps and aiding Jews to escape, the movement was reborn to tackle the problems of a changing world. It expressed a Christian socialism, more or less in line with the beginning of a new political left. Political activism was very broad and included the denunciation of torture, East–West debate on European integration and taking a stance on the process of decolonization. It facilitated meetings between employers, managers, and trade unionists to discern a new economic order. After the events of May 68, Calvinism in France became much more left-wing in its orientation.

One doctrinal text produced in the 1960s, &quot;Church and Authorities&quot;, was described as Marxist in its orientation. Churches now seized for themselves the political and social issues to tackle, such as nuclear power and justice for the Third World. In the early 2000s, the Social Christianity movement temporarily discontinued and its journal &quot;Other Times&quot; ceased to be published. The movement was relaunched on 10 June 2010 with a petition signed by over 240 people, and now maintains an active presence with its own website. Economically, most Calvinists have supported capitalism and have been in the vanguard of promoting free-market capitalism, and have produced many of France&#x27;s leading entrepreneurs. With regard to politics and social issues, they are socialists. Three of France&#x27;s post-war prime ministers have been Calvinists, despite Protestants only making up two percent of the population. Two of these prime ministers have been socialists.

=== Wales ===
In Wales, Calvinistic Methodism is the largest non-conformist religion. Its beginnings may be traced to Griffith Jones (1684–1761), of Llanddowror, Carmarthenshire, whose sympathy for the poor led him to set on foot a system of circulating charity schools for the education of children. Until the 19th century, the prevailing thought amongst Welsh non-conformists was that &quot;it would be wiser if the churches limited their activities to those of the altar and not to meddle at all with the state and social questions.&quot; This stemmed partly from the traditional nonconformist belief in the separation of church and state.

In his influential sermon &quot;Y Ddwy Alwedigaeth&quot; (&quot;The Two Vocations&quot;), Emrys ap Iwan challenged this passive pietism. He wrote: &quot;We must not think, like the old Methodists, Puritans and some Catholics, that we can only seek Godliness outside our earthly vocation.&quot; He condemned those Christians who limited godliness to directly religious matters such as Sabbath observance and personal devotion. He declared that all earthly things, including language and culture, have some kind of divine origin. Many of the founders of the Welsh nationalist social-democratic party, Plaid Cymru, were also Calvinists, including John Edward Daniel. Daniel was the theologian credited for bringing neo-orthodoxy to Wales. Daniel argued that God did not create man as an isolated individual but as a social being. The second generation of Plaid Cymru leaders included R. Tudur Jones. His political stance, combined with Calvinist doctrine, created an integrated vision that was significant to the religious life of Christian Wales in the later half of the 20th century. Jones argued that the &quot;state should be a servant, to preserve order and to allow men to live the good life.&quot;

The Calvinist tradition in Plaid Cymru influenced its non-violent approach. According to Rhys Llwyd, &quot;[t]he ideal is no fist violence, no verbal violence, and no heart violence. ... Christians ... point to the New Testament example of Jesus Christ clearing the temple. Here there is no suggestion of violence against people; rather the tables are turned as a symbolic act. The life and teaching of Jesus Christ were seen as the foundations of nonviolent direct action [for Plaid Cymru members] ... loving their enemies on the one hand, but not compromising on what they saw as an issue of moral rightness.&quot; Plaid Cymru continues to see itself as very much part of the Christian pacifist tradition.

== In Methodism ==

Many prominent British Methodists have been proponents of socialism, including Donald Soper (a Methodist minister and Labour politician), whose West London Methodist Mission reached out to the poor. Methodists were prominent in the early labour movement in Britain and the socialist British Labour Party is said to &quot;owe more to Methodism than Marx&quot;.

== Reception ==
In Britain, Christian socialism is viewed positively by many different backgrounds, ranging from Nonconformists to Roman Catholic, particularly Anglo-Catholic Ritualism. It is viewed critically by some socialists, who reject it as utopian socialism and for its methodology, and by some religious figures and popes, who rejected socialism&#x27;s compatibility with Christianity due to its perceived atheism and materialism. Continental Reformed Protestant pastor Henri Nick defended it, saying: &quot;It is not socialism that I would criticise, but atheism falsely called social.&quot;

Anglo-Catholic Christian socialism was part of Catholic polemic against perceived Protestant individualism and puritanism, which led many anti-Ritualist Protestants to associate Catholicism and socialism. Charles Haddon Spurgeon, an English Particular Baptist preacher, was critical of socialist doctrines, and warned that those who seek socialism &quot;may soon have too much of it&quot;. Specifically, he regarded collectivist Christianity as inferior to faith on an individual level. He said: &quot;I would not have you exchange the gold of individual Christianity for the base metal of Christian Socialism.&quot; Tommy Fallot, a French Lutheran pastor, argued: &quot;Socialism has drawn a good deal of its program from the Gospel. It seeks to build a society on the pillars of justice, something the Gospel seeks to do as well. In that regard, a condemnation of socialism would represent a condemnation of the Gospel and the prophets.&quot;

Views of Christian socialism generally depend on the left–right political spectrum. While Christian leftists argue that Jesus would prioritize the poor and migrant&#x27;s rights over opposition to abortion, Christian rightists argue he would be against wealth redistribution, illegal immigrants, abortion, and same-sex marriage. The conservative view is reflected by Lawrence Reed, president emeritus of the American libertarian-leaning Foundation for Economic Education, American conservative and evangelical Christian Johnnie Moore Jr., and Bryan Fischer, an American traditionalist conservative, of the American Family Association, a Christian fundamentalist organization. Opposing this view on the right is Quentin Letts, who said, &quot;Jesus preached fairness — you could almost call him a Lefty&quot;.

<text>Chobham Common is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest north of Chobham in Surrey. It is a Nature Conservation Review site, Grade I and a national nature reserve. It is part of the Thames Basin Heaths Special Protection Area and the Thursley, Ash, Pirbright and Chobham Special Area of Conservation. It contains three scheduled monuments. Most of the site is managed by the Surrey Wildlife Trust as the Chobham Common nature reserve, but the SSSI also includes a small private reserve managed by the Trust, Gracious Pond.

==Animals==
* 26 species of mammal have been recorded on the site including the nationally rare water vole.
* 116 species of bird have been recorded. The Common is a nationally important breeding area for European nightjar, woodlark and Dartford warbler.
* 9 species of reptiles and amphibians have been recorded, including adders and the nationally rare sand lizard.
* The Common is nationally important for its invertebrate fauna being the best site in the UK for spiders, hymenoptera (bees wasp and ants) and ladybirds – it is one of the last two sites on the mainland UK for the red barbed ant &quot;Formica rufibarbis&quot;.
* 23 species of dragonfly
* 33 species of butterfly including large colonies of the rare silver studded blue have been recorded.

==Plants==
* 390 species of vascular plant
* A good assemblages of bryophytes, lichens and fungi have been recorded.
** Of most note are the marsh club moss (&quot;Lycopodiella inundata&quot;) and Deptford pink (&quot;Dianthus armeria&quot;)
* A good assemblages of wetland species including sundews (&quot;Drosera&quot;) and marsh gentian (&quot;Gentiana pneumonanthe&quot;), and of heathland road verge species.

==History==
Peat and tumuli at the site suggest that, like other non-mountainous heaths, Chobham Common was transformed from to mostly shrubs, grass and bog when late paleolithic farmers and wood-gatherers cleared much of the primary woodland that before their arrival cloaked the country. This exposed and degraded the fragile topsoils of the site, creating the conditions favoured by heathland. After the initial clearance the area would have been kept free of trees by grazing and fuel gathering. The specific earliest periods of occupation were the Neolithic period and the Bronze Age; analysis of peat cores from areas with similar geology and patterns of settlement elsewhere in southern Britain would suggest the heathland on Chobham Common emerged at some time during these periods.

An inclosure award was made by Parliament in 1855 of part to the Earl of Onslow outright, the rest, for example, in 1911 comprising &quot;several thousand acres of common land&quot; was uninclosed but associated with his land, at which time Chobham remained a large parish (i.e. village or town) in southern England, covering .

In addition to the Great Camp of 1853, the common also hosted the Battle of Chobham Common in September 1871, as part of the Autumn Manoeuvres of that year. During the First World War, trenching exercises were held in August 1915 in advance of Kitchener&#x27;s Third Army&#x27;s mobilisation in France.

Chobham Common was used by the military during the 1920s and 1930s, and throughout the Second World War. Captured enemy tanks were also tested in the common as was equipment to detonate land mines using flails and probably caused the significant damage that lead to reseeding.

Immediately after the Second World War, the southern part was ploughed and seeded with an annual grass to allow the natural vegetation to re-establish, while the area north of Staple Hill, which was not as heavily damaged, was allowed to recover naturally. By the 1950s, plants and associated small animals were recovering well. At this time the common was heavily grazed by rabbits with little scrub and large areas of close-cropped heather and gorse. Myxomatosis reached the area in 1955 and consequently the heather and gorse on Chobham Common grew and scrub began to develop. By the 1960s scrub including brambles was starting to become a problem. Surrey County Council purchased the slightly reduced area comprising the common from William Onslow, 6th Earl of Onslow for £1 per acre by in 1966.

===Monuments===
* There are three scheduled monuments on Chobham Common: a Bronze Age barrow, and two earthworks of unknown date and origin known as &quot;The Beegardens&quot;.
* Queen Victoria reviewed troops encamped on the Common, including the Light Brigade (famous from the &quot;Charge of the Light Brigade&quot;), before their departure to the Crimea during the Crimean War in 1853. The Victoria Monument erected on the site in 1901 commemorates this review.

==Loss of heathlands nationally==
Over 80% of the heathlands that once covered extensive areas of southern Britain have been lost, with similar losses on the near continent where the remaining lowland heathland of oceanic temperate regions occurs. This dramatic decline began during the eighteenth century and early nineteenth century as changes in agriculture, which resulted in the loss of grazing on heaths, and as the growing availability of cheap coal as an alternative to other fuels, brought traditional heathland management to an end in many areas. Large areas of heathland were lost to neglect or subjected to agricultural “improvement” and enclosure as arable farming methods advanced. During the twentieth century&#x27; 50% of the heathland that remained in 1919 was converted to commercial forestry and substantial areas have been lost to development and invading scrub. In geology and soil, it lies on the sandy Bagshot Formation, which is named after a nearby village of Surrey, and where covered by topsoil this is accordingly naturally wet, acid heath soil, with patches of dry, acid heath soil, due to the drainage and chemistry of this material. This accounts for which is just 1.9% of English soil and 0.2% of Welsh soil. In wettest patches which have peat this is the best type of soil for pines and coniferous landscapes.

==Maintenance==
The survival of Chobham Common as an extensive area of lowland heath is largely due to the historic isolation of the Chobham area where traditional heathland management continued until the early twentieth century. While turbary (turf cutting) was still practised on a small scale at the beginning of the twentieth century it had ceased to be an important factor in the management of the Common by that time. Rough grazing and the cutting of heather, gorse and small trees began to decline after 1914 and had almost completely ended by the time of the Second World War. Photographic evidence and verbal reports indicate that during the early part of the twentieth century large tracts of &quot;Calluna vulgaris&quot; (heather) with extensive areas of wet heath and open bog dominated the Common. There was little scrub and the only trees of any great size were at the Clump on Staple Hill and the Lone Pine to the south of the Beegarden.

===Management===
In 1984, Surrey County Council produced the first management plan for Chobham Common which acknowledged invading scrub, fire and erosion as the main threats to the site. The Surrey Trust for Nature Conservation (now renamed the Surrey Wildlife Trust) had carried out small-scale scrub clearance work from 1974 onwards and Surrey County Council began clearing scrub on the Common from the 1970s onwards; however despite their best efforts the scrub continued to advance. While describing birch and pine invasion on the Common as &quot;“Possibly the most serious problem for nature conservation”&quot; the 1984 Management Plan states, &quot;“Widespread invasion control is difficult to justify financially. Intervention management will therefore be limited to the more significant open habitats and places where an acceptable level of tree cover can be maintained at low cost”&quot;.

From the late 1980s, a more aggressive approach to scrub management was adopted together with more active conservation management starting with the large scale annual events for schools and volunteers such as &quot;“Purge the Pine”&quot; and &quot;“Free Christmas Tree”&quot; events. While these events, which involved over 1,500 volunteers in some years, dramatically reduced the threat to the Common from pine invasion, birch remained a major threat to the site.

The 1992 Management Plan took a much more positive approach to conservation management of Chobham Common. In the same year the site was proposed as a national nature reserve (NNR) and a substantial grant covering a ten-year period was awarded to Surrey County Council under the Countryside Stewardship Scheme for the management of 280 hectares of the Common. The scheme was extended to cover the whole NNR for a further ten years in October 2002. At the time of writing at least seventeen hectares of scrub management takes place each year together with at least twenty hectares of conservation mowing, and bracken control. Bare ground creation and heather cutting, and pond, scrape and pool creation are also carried out to enhance bio-diversity. The restoration of conservation grazing on Chobham Common is seen as a priority by site managers.

==Fire==
Fires occurred fairly regularly during the 1950s and 1960s and the whole of Chobham Common was seriously damaged by major fires in the early and mid-1970s which caused the loss of the smooth snake (&quot;Coronella austriaca&quot;) and sand lizard from the site and allowed extensive areas of purple moor grass and bracken to establish. Since 1976, a network of fire tracks and firebreaks has been created and progressively upgraded. Since 1990 rangers and volunteers have fire watched during periods of high risk and in 2006 the rangers were equipped with a fire fighting system. These measures together with close liaison with the Surrey Fire Service have served to reduce both the frequency and scale of fires on the site.

The major utilities that cross Chobham Common were constructed during the 1950s and early 1960s. The M3 motorway was completed in 1974 cutting the site in half. Some attempts were made at mitigation work at the time, but with hindsight they were both inappropriate and inadequate and large blocks of gorse (Ulex europeaus) developed in the zone of disturbance on either side of the motorway creating further fragmentation of the site and causing serious fire risks. Following serious fires in 2001 and 2002 the Department for Transport provided funding for clearance of the gorse in the zone of disturbance and this area is mown annually to suppress any gorse regrowth.

Strong summer heat can occur to dry out the long grass, shrubs and trees of acidic heath soil. When a fire breaks out, Surrey Fire and Rescue Service (in the case of the major May 2010 fire attracting rubbernecking, Surrey Police and Hampshire Fire and Rescue assisted) extinguish it in a range of vehicles and teams.

In August 2020, a fire on the common spread to the golf course at the Wentworth Club causing the abandonment of the final event of the Rose Ladies Series.

==Erosion mitigation==
The first car parks on Chobham Common were created in 1936 at Staple Hill and south of the Monument. After the Second World War, the recreational use of the Common grew dramatically. This recreational use developed in an ad-hoc manner with walkers and horse riders creating tracks then abandoning them for new routes as they gullied and became impassable, causing wide scale erosion of the site.

It is also reported that during the 1950s and 1960s visitors regularly took vehicles onto Chobham Common further adding to the problem. An aerial photograph dated 1964 clearly shows severe erosion problems on Tank Hill and Staple Hill. By the time Surrey County Council acquired Chobham Common in 1968 there were nine car parks on the area covered by this plan. Initially the Council wished to develop a country park but these plans were soon dropped in favour of informal recreation and nature conservation.

Erosion and disturbance continued to be serious problems through the 1970s and 1980s. While attempts to restrict horse riding proved unsuccessful, by the late 1980s both walkers and riders were showing a marked preference for the growing network of high quality fire tracks.

In 1992, a consultative process began to resolve long running conflicts of interest between horse riders and other users, and to rationalise the rights of way networks in order to meet the needs of visitors while protecting sensitive habitats and species. Following a public enquiry in 1996 the present network of rights of way and agreed horse rides which incorporates the fire track network was installed. Since then there have been few serious erosion problems and disturbance has been greatly reduced.

==Rail access==
*Longcross railway station
Very limited service at this station. Alternatives are Virginia Water and Sunningdale.

==Access==
Chobham Common is open to the public, has six car parks, an extensive network of footpaths, bridleways, other tracks and three self-guided trails.

<doc id="328801" wikidata="Q1984232" url="?curid=328801" title="Shemale">
<text>Shemale (also spelled she-male; also she-man and he-she) is a term most commonly used in the pornography industry to describe trans women or other people with male genitalia and female secondary sex characteristics (including breasts) acquired via hormones or surgery. Many people in the transgender community consider the term offensive and degrading. Using the term &quot;shemale&quot; for a trans woman may imply that she is working in the sex trade.

==Academic use==
The term has been used by some psychologists to refer to transgender women who have transitioned, but have never undergone genital surgery.

Some biologists have used &quot;shemale&quot; to refer to male non-human animals displaying female traits or behaviors, such as female pheromones being given off by male reptiles. Joan Roughgarden, a biologist and Charles Darwin-critic, rejected use of the term in the reptile literature, as she says it is &quot;degrading and has been borrowed from the porn industry.&quot; She writes that &quot;gynomorphic male&quot; and &quot;andromorphic female&quot; are preferred in scientific literature, adding, &quot;I hope future work on these animals is carried out with more professionalism.&quot;

== Other usage ==
Since the mid-19th century, the term &quot;she-male&quot; has been applied to &quot;almost anyone who appears to have bridged gender lines&quot;, including effeminate men and lesbians. In the early 19th century, &quot;she-male&quot; was used as a colloquialism in American literature for female, often pejoratively. Davy Crockett is quoted as using the term in regard to a shooting match; when his opponent challenges Crockett to shoot near his opponent&#x27;s wife, Crockett is reported to have replied: &quot;&#x27;No, No, Mike,&#x27; sez I, &#x27;Davy Crockett&#x27;s hand would be sure to shake, if his iron pointed within a hundred miles of a shemale, and I give up beat...&#x27;&quot; It was used through the 1920s to describe a woman, usually a feminist or an intellectual. 

The term came to have a more negative connotation over time and been used to describe a &quot;hateful woman&quot; or &quot;bitch.&quot; Up through the mid-1970s, it was used to describe an assertive woman, &quot;especially a disliked, distrusted woman; a bitch.&quot;

The term later took on an implicit sexual overtone. In her 1990 book, &quot;From Masculine To Feminine And All points In Between&quot;, Jennifer Anne Stevens defined &quot;she-male&quot; as &quot;usually a gay male who lives full-time as a woman; a gay transgenderist.&quot; The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; defines &quot;she-male&quot; as &quot;a passive male homosexual or transvestite.&quot; It has been used as gay slang for &quot;faggot&quot;.

== Connotations ==
In 1979, Janice Raymond employed the term as a derogatory descriptor for trans women in her controversial book, &quot;The Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male&quot;. Raymond and other cultural feminists like Mary Daly argue that a &quot;she-male&quot; or &quot;male-to-constructed female&quot; is still male and constitutes a patriarchal attack by males upon the female essence. This is often considered to be part of trans-exclusionary radical feminist (TERF) ideology. In some cultures, &quot;shemale&quot; can also be used interchangeably with other terms referring to trans women.

The term has since become a derogatory term applied to trans women. Psychologists Dana Finnegan and Emily Mcnally write that the term &quot;tends to have demeaning connotations.&quot; French professor John Phillips writes that &quot;shemale&quot; is &quot;a linguistic oxymoron that simultaneously reflects but, by its very impossibility, challenges [gender] binary thinking, collapsing the divide between the masculine and the feminine.&quot; Trans author Leslie Feinberg writes, &quot;&#x27;he-she&#x27; and &#x27;she-male&#x27; describe the person&#x27;s gender expression with the first pronoun and the birth sex with the second. The hyphenation signals a crisis of language and an apparent social contradiction, since sex and gender are &#x27;supposed&#x27; to match.&quot; Jack Halberstam, director of the Institute for Research on Women, Gender and Sexuality, describes &quot;she-male&quot; as &quot;a degrading pornographic term&quot;. The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation has said the term is a &quot;dehumanizing slur&quot; and should not be used &quot;except in a direct quote that reveals the bias of the person quoted.&quot;

Willow Arune wrote, &quot;Using the term &quot;she-male&quot; for a transsexual woman would be considered highly offensive, for it implies that she is working &#x27;in the [sex] trade.&#x27; It may be considered libelous.&quot; Melissa Hope Ditmore, of the Trafficked Persons Rights Project, says the term &quot;is an invention of the sex industry, and most transwomen find the term abhorrent.&quot; Biologist and transgender activist Julia Serano states that it remains &quot;derogatory or sensationalistic.&quot; According to sex columnist Regina Lynn, &quot;Porn marketers use &#x27;she-male&#x27; for a very specific purpose — to sell porn to straight guys without triggering their homophobia — that has nothing to do with actual transgendered people (or helping men overcome their homophobia, either).&quot; 

Some have adopted the term as a self-descriptor, often in the context of sex work. Gender non-conforming author Kate Bornstein wrote that a friend who self-identified as &quot;she-male&quot; described herself as &quot;tits, big hair, lots of make-up, and a dick.&quot; Pornographic actress Wendy Williams stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t think &quot;tranny&quot; and &quot;she-male&quot; are slurs. They were words initially used so the laymen person could understand the products they were buying in porn. There are more issues we have to worry about: suicide, the homeless rate, getting an education and finding jobs as trans women.&quot; According to sex columnist Sasha, &quot;The term &quot;shemale&quot; is used in [the pornography] setting to denote a fetishized sexual persona and is not typically used by transgendered women outside of sex work. Many transgendered women are offended by this categorization and call themselves T-girls or trans.&quot;

== In popular culture ==

In addition to its use in pornography, the term has been used as a punch line or for rhetorical effect. Flora Finch starred in &quot;The She-Male Sleuth&quot;, a 1920 film comedy. As part of the 42nd Street Art Project in 1994, designer Adelle Lutz turned a former shop in Times Square called American Male into &quot;American She-Male&quot;, with brightly colored mannequins and clothes made of condoms. The 2004 &quot;Arrested Development&quot; episode &quot;Sad Sack&quot; had a gag where Maeby tricks Lindsay into wearing a shirt that says &quot;Shémale&quot;, in order to convince a suitor Lindsay is transgender. Film critic Manohla Dargis has written about the lack of &quot;real women&quot; in summer blockbusters, claiming Judd Apatow comedies feature men who act more like leading ladies: &quot;These aren&#x27;t the she-males you find in the back pages of &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, mind you. The Apatow men hit the screen anatomically intact: they’re emasculated but not castrated, as the repeated images of the flopping genitals in &quot;Forgetting Sarah Marshall&quot; remind you.&quot; 

The word came under extreme criticism when it was used during episode four of &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot; season 6. Logo TV, the show&#x27;s broadcast station, released a statement on April 14, 2014, saying: &quot;We wanted to thank the community for sharing their concerns around a recent segment and the use of the term &#x27;she-mail&#x27; on Drag Race. Logo has pulled the episode from all of our platforms and that challenge will not appear again. Furthermore, we are removing the &#x27;You&#x27;ve got she-mail&#x27; intro from new episodes of the series. We did not intend to cause any offense, but in retrospect we realize that it was insensitive. We sincerely apologize.&quot;

<text>Beaune (; in Burgundian: &quot;Beane&quot;) is the wine capital of Burgundy in the Côte d&#x27;Or department in eastern France. It is located between Lyon and Dijon. Beaune is one of the key wine centers in France, and the center of Burgundy wine production and business. The annual wine auction of the Hospices de Beaune is the primary wine auction in France.

The town is surrounded by some of the world&#x27;s most famous wine villages, while the facilities and cellars of many producers, large and small, are situated in the historic center of Beaune itself, as they have been since Roman times. With a rich historical and architectural heritage, Beaune is considered the &quot;Capital of Burgundy wines&quot;. It is an ancient and historic town on a plain by the hills of the Côte d&#x27;Or, with features remaining from the pre-Roman and Roman eras, through the medieval and renaissance periods.

Beaune is a walled city, with about half of the battlements, ramparts, and the moat, having survived in good condition. The central &quot;old town&quot; or &quot;vieille ville&quot; is extensive. Historically Beaune is intimately connected with the Dukes of Burgundy.

The 15th-century Hospices de Beaune, in the town center, is one of the best preserved renaissance buildings in Europe. Other landmarks in Beaune include the old market (les Halles), the Beffroi (clock tower), and the collegiate church of Notre Dame. Beaune is the main center for the &quot;Burgundian tile&quot; polychrome renaissance roofing style of the region. Because of its historical importance in wine production and the unique system of &quot;terroir&quot; in the region, the town of Beaune was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2015 as part of the Climats, terroirs of Burgundy site.

==Wine==

Beaune is one of the wine communes of the Côte de Beaune subregion of the Burgundy wine region, which bears the name of this town. Although Beaune is lacking a Grand cru vineyard in the commune, it is the hub of the region&#x27;s wine business, as most of Burgundy&#x27;s major négociants are here. Beaune is renowned for its annual charity wine auction on behalf of the Hospices de Beaune.

It is on the &quot;route des Grands Crus&quot; tourist trail among the vineyards. The road runs north from Beaune to Gevrey Chambertin and Nuits-Saint-Georges and south to Nolay, Saisy and Autun.

==The town==

Beaune is the centre for wine industry services (such as tractors and equipment for vat-rooms) as well as a number of wine-related institutes and education facilities. The train station is served by TGV, through Dijon or Lyon.

There is a comprehensive &quot;traditional&quot; shopping area clustered around the central square with a focus on gourmet food, fashion, and wine, while large supermarkets, business parks, etc., are situated on the outskirts of town.

Beaune has a major fine food market on Saturdays, where there are a large number of stall holders supplying a broad selection of products and specialties from Burgundy and the surrounding regions. For example, Bresse chickens, Jura cheeses, small goods, spices, produce of every variety as well as seasonal specialties such as truffles. There is a smaller market on Wednesday, and special-event markets and fetes are held throughout the year.

Although Beaune is not primarily a tourist town but one centred on the wine industry, it nevertheless attracts a large amount of tourists. About five traditional smaller hotels are located within the city walls with around five chain hotels on the outskirts.

Beaune is one of a number of towns in Europe asserting a key role in the &quot;invention of film&quot;; a number of murals and other tourist attractions reflect this.

Technically Beaune is a commune in eastern France, a sub-prefecture of department 21, the Côte-d&#x27;Or department, in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region.

==Population==

==Origin, geography and climate==
The name &quot;Beaune&quot; derives from the Latinised Gaulish word &quot;Belena&quot;, which was the name of a spring around which the settlement was established. That name in turn is derived from &quot;Belen&quot; or &quot;Belenos&quot;, a god of fast-flowing water. A Roman fort was built there in the first century A.D. and it was already a prosperous wine-growing region in the 13th century.

The town is served by a small watercourse, the &quot;Bouzaise&quot; (or &quot;Bouzaize&quot;) of which the source is in a public park at the north-east boundary.

Beaune has a semi-continental climate with an oceanic tendency. The oceanic influence is seen with frequent rains in each season (though autumn has the most and summer the least) and many weather changes. On the other hand, one sees the semi-continental influence with one of the greatest seasonal temperature differences, characterized by cold winters with frequent snowfall, and hot summers with violent storms. It is this climate which creates the unique environment for which the Côte d&#x27;Or is known.

==Hospices de Beaune==
Founded in 1442 by Nicolas Rolin, chancellor of the Duke of Burgundy, and his wife, the Hospices are a charity running hospitals and other services for the needy. Following from past donations, they own vineyards in Burgundy.

==The American Expeditionary Forces University at Beaune==
At the end of WWI the American Expeditionary Forces University was established in Beaune, complete with its own chapter of Phi Beta Kappa. Faculty included Walter M. Chandler, a Progressive Party member and, later, a Republican Party member of the U.S. House of Representatives from the State of New York.

<text>The 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment–Delta (1st SFOD-D), also known as Delta Force, Combat Applications Group (CAG), or within Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) as Task Force Green, is a special operations force of the United States Army under the operational control of JSOC. The unit&#x27;s missions primarily involve counterterrorism, hostage rescue, direct action, and special reconnaissance, often against high-value targets.

Delta Force, along with the Intelligence Support Activity, and its Navy and Air Force counterparts, DEVGRU (SEAL Team 6) and the 24th Special Tactics Squadron, are the U.S. military&#x27;s tier one special mission units that are tasked with performing the most complex, covert, and dangerous missions directed by the president of the United States and the secretary of defense.

Most Delta Force operators and combat support members are selected from the Army Special Operations Command&#x27;s 75th Ranger Regiment and U.S. Army Special Forces, though selection is open to other special operations and conventional units across the Army and other military branches.

==History==
Delta Force was created in 1977 after numerous well-publicized terrorist incidents led the U.S. government to develop a full-time counter-terrorism unit.

Key military and government figures had already been briefed on this type of unit in the early 1960s. Charlie Beckwith, a Special Forces (Green Berets) officer and Vietnam War veteran, served as an exchange officer with the British Army&#x27;s 22 Special Air Service Regiment during the Malayan Emergency. On his return, Beckwith presented a detailed report highlighting the U.S. Army&#x27;s vulnerability in not having a SAS-type unit. U.S. Army Special Forces in that period focused on unconventional warfare providing training and medical care to indigenous resistance fighters, but Beckwith recognized the need for &quot;not only a force of teachers, but a force of doers&quot;. He envisioned highly adaptable and completely autonomous small teams with a broad array of special skills for direct action and counter-terrorism missions. He briefed military and government figures, who were resistant to creating a new unit outside of Special Forces or changing existing methods.

Finally, in the mid-1970s, as the threat of terrorism grew, Pentagon and Army senior leaders appointed Beckwith to form the unit. Beckwith estimated that it would take 24 months to get his new unit mission ready. Beckwith&#x27;s estimate came from a conversation he had had earlier with Brigadier John Watts while in England in 1976. Watts had made it clear to Beckwith that it would take eighteen months to build a squadron, but advised him to tell Army leaders that it would take two years, and not to &quot;let anyone talk (him) out of this.&quot; To justify why it would take two years to build Delta, Beckwith and his staff drafted what they dubbed the &quot;Robert Redford Paper,&quot; which outlined its necessities and historical precedents for a four-phase selection/assessment process.

Delta Force was established on 19 November 1977, by Beckwith and Colonel Thomas Henry. In the meantime, Colonel Bob &quot;Black Gloves&quot; Mountel of the 5th Special Forces Group created a unit to bridge the short-term gap that existed until Delta was ready, dubbed Blue Light. The initial members of the unit were screened from volunteers and put through a specialized selection process in early 1978, involving a series of land navigation problems in mountainous terrain while carrying increasing weight. The purpose was to test candidates&#x27; endurance, stamina, willingness to endure, and mental resolve. The first training course lasted from April to September 1978. Delta Force was certified as fully mission capable in fall 1979, right before the Iran hostage crisis.

On 4 November 1979, 52 American diplomats and citizens were taken captive and held in the U.S. embassy in Tehran, Iran. Delta Force was tasked to plan and execute Operation Eagle Claw, the effort to recover the hostages from the embassy by force on the nights of 24 and 25 April in 1980. The operation was aborted due to helicopter failures. The review commission that examined the failure found 23 problems with the operation, among them unexpected weather encountered by the aircraft, command-and-control problems between the multi-service component commanders, a collision between a helicopter and a ground-refueling tanker aircraft, and mechanical problems that reduced the number of available helicopters from eight to five (one fewer than the minimum desired) before the mission contingent could leave the trans-loading/refueling site.

After the failed operation, the U.S. government realized more changes were needed. The 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne), also known as the &quot;Night Stalkers&quot;, was created for special operations requiring air support. The Navy&#x27;s SEAL Team Six, an earlier incarnation of the current Naval Special Warfare Development Group, was created for maritime counter-terrorism operations. The Joint Special Operations Command was created for command and control of the military&#x27;s various counter-terrorism units.

== Organization and structure ==
The unit is under the organization of the U.S. Army Special Operations Command (USASOC), but is controlled by the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC). Command of 1st SFOD-D is a colonel&#x27;s billet. Virtually all information about the unit is highly classified and details about specific missions or operations generally are not available publicly. The unit is headquartered at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

Delta Force&#x27;s structure is similar to the British 22 SAS Regiment, which inspired Delta&#x27;s formation. In &quot;Not a Good Day to Die: The Untold Story of Operation Anaconda&quot;, &quot;Army Times&quot; staff writer Sean Naylor describes Delta as having, at the time (in 2001), nearly 1,000 soldiers, of whom about 250 to 300 are trained to conduct direct action and hostage rescue operations. The rest are combat support and service support personnel who are among the very best in their fields.

Naylor further details Delta Force&#x27;s structure in his book &quot;Relentless Strike: The Secret History of Joint Special Operations Command&quot;. He describes a few formations in Delta, primarily the following operational elements:

* A Squadron
* B Squadron
* C Squadron
* D Squadron
* E Squadron
* G Squadron (advanced force operations (AFO), formerly known as Operational Support Troop (OST))
* Signal Squadron
* Combat Support Squadron
* Combat Development Directorate
* Selection and Training

A, B, C, and DSquadrons are sabre squadrons (assault). CSquadron was activated around 1990 and DSquadron in 2006. Combat Support Squadron was activated in 2005. ESquadron was activated in 1989 and is stationed separately in Fort Eustis, Virginia, where it is known as the Aviation Technology Office. An earlier forerunner of the unit was known as SeaSpray.

Within each squadron there are three troops: troops 1 and 2 (assault) and troop 3 (reconnaissance). Each squadron is led by a lieutenant colonel (O-5), executive officer and a command sergeant major (E-9). Troops are led by captains (O-3) or majors (O-4) and are assisted by sergeants major (E-9). Each troop has four teams, each one led by a team leader, a master sergeant (E-8) or sergeant first class (E-7), and an assistant team leader who can also have the same rank. Each team usually has five or six members.

=== Recruitment ===
Since the 1990s, the Army has posted recruitment notices for the 1st SFOD-D. The Army, however, has never released an official fact sheet for the unit. The recruitment notices in Fort Bragg&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;Paraglide&quot;, refer to Delta Force by name, and label it &quot;...the U.S. Army&#x27;s special operations unit organized for the conduct of missions requiring rapid response with surgical application of a wide variety of unique special operations skills...&quot;. The notice states that applicants must be in the grade of E-4 through E-8, have at least two and a half years of service remaining in their enlistment, be 22 years or older, and have an Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery GT score of 110 or higher to attend a briefing to be considered for admission. Candidates must be airborne qualified or volunteer for airborne training. Officer candidates need to be O-3 or O-4. All candidates must be eligible for a security clearance level of &quot;secret&quot; and have not been convicted by court-martial or have disciplinary action noted in their official military personnel file under the provisions of Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

On 29 June 2006 during a session of the Committee on Armed Services, General Wayne Downing testified before the U.S. House of Representatives that &quot;[t]he Delta Force is probably 70 percent Rangers who have come out of either a Ranger [to] Special Forces track or directly from [the] Ranger Regiment to Delta&quot;.

=== Selection process ===
Selection is held twice a year (late March to late April, and late September to late October) at Camp Dawson, West Virginia, and lasts four weeks. Eric Haney&#x27;s book &quot;Inside Delta Force&quot; described the selection course and its inception in detail. Haney wrote that the course began with standard tests including push-ups, sit-ups, and a run, an inverted crawl and a swim fully dressed. The candidates were then put through a series of land navigation courses, one of which required them to travel at night while carrying a rucksack. With every successive challenge, the distance to cover and the weight of the rucksack are increased, while less time is allotted. The final challenge was a march with a rucksack over rough terrain that had to be completed in an unknown amount of time; this was also colloquially known as &quot;The Long Walk&quot;. Haney wrote that only the senior officer and NCO in charge of selection were allowed to see the set time limits, but all assessment and selection tasks and conditions were set by Delta training cadre.

The mental portion of the testing began with numerous psychological exams. Each candidate was then called to face a board of Delta instructors, unit psychologists, and the Delta commander, who asked the candidate a barrage of questions and then dissected every response and mannerism to exhaust the candidate mentally. The commander then approaches the candidate and informs him if he has been selected. Those who passed the screening process underwent an intense six-month Operator Training Course (OTC), to learn counter-terrorism and counter-intelligence techniques, and training with firearms and other weapons. Participants were allowed very little contact with friends and family for the duration.

In an interview, former Delta operator Paul Howe mentioned the high attrition rate of the Delta selection course. He said that out of his two classes of 120 applicants each, 12 to 14 completed the selection. Former Navy SEAL, DEVGRU and Delta operator Kevin Holland stated that in his selection class 120 candidates started, 16 passed and eight finished OTC.

The Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s secretive Special Activities Center (SAC) and more specifically its Special Operations Group (SOG), often works with – and recruits – former operators from Delta Force.

=== Training ===
According to Eric Haney, the unit&#x27;s Operator Training Course is approximately six months long. While the course is constantly changing, the skills taught broadly include the following:

* Marksmanship:
** The trainees shoot without aiming at stationary targets at close range until they gain almost complete accuracy, then progress to moving targets.
** Once these shooting skills are perfected, trainees move to a shoot house and clear rooms of &quot;enemy&quot; targets – first one only, then two at a time, then three, and finally four. When all trainees can demonstrate the sufficient skill required, &quot;hostages&quot; are added to the mix.
* Demolitions and Breaching:
** Trainees learn how to pick many different locks, including those on cars and safes.
** Advanced demolition and bomb-making using common materials.
* Combined skills (the FBI, FAA, and other agencies were used to advise on the training of this portion of OTC):
** The new Delta operators use demolition and marksmanship at the shoot house and other training facilities to train for hostage and counter-terrorist operations with assault and sniper troops working together. They practice terrorist or hostage situations in buildings, aircraft, and other settings.
** All trainees learn how to set sniper positions around a building containing hostages. They learn the proper ways to set up a Tactical Operations Center (TOC) and communicate in an organized manner. Although Delta has specialized sniper troops, all members go through this training.
** The students then go back to the shoot house and the &quot;hostages&quot; are replaced with other students and Delta Force members. Live ammunition is known to have been used in these exercises, to test the students, and build trust between one another.
* Tradecraft (during the first OTCs and Delta creation, CIA personnel were used to teach this portion of the training):
** Students learn different espionage-related skills, such as dead drops, brief encounters, pickups, load and unload signals, danger and safe signals, surveillance and counter-surveillance.
* Executive Protection (during the first OTCs and creation of Delta, the U.S. State Department&#x27;s Diplomatic Security Service and the United States Secret Service were consulted and advised Delta):
** Students take an advanced driving course to learn to use a vehicle or many vehicles as defensive and offensive weapons.
** They then learn techniques for VIP and diplomatic protection developed by the Secret Service and DSS.
* Culmination Exercise:
** A final test requires the students to apply and dynamically adapt all of the skills that they have learned.

Delta Force trains with other foreign special operations units to improve tactics and increase relationships with them, including the Australian Special Air Service Regiment, the British Special Air Service, and Canada&#x27;s Joint Task Force 2.

=== Unit name ===
In a 2010 article, Marc Ambinder reported that &quot;Army Compartmented Elements&quot; (ACE) was a new cover name for Delta Force. However, Ambinder subsequently wrote an e-book about JSOC in which he reported that the Army Compartmented Elements is a different unit from Delta.

In January 2022 it was reported that the name of the unit may have recently been changed to the 3rd Operational Support Group.

== Secrecy ==
The Department of Defense tightly controls information about Delta Force and usually refuses to comment publicly on the highly secretive unit and its activities, unless the unit is part of a major operation or a unit member has been killed. Delta operators are granted an enormous amount of flexibility and autonomy during military operations overseas. Relaxed grooming standards such as civilian hairstyles and facial hair are allowed to enable the members to blend in and avoid recognition as military personnel.

2023 Israel incident

During President Joe Biden&#x27;s visit to Israel, the White House accidentally published a photo of Delta Force operators with unblurred faces and tattoos, drawing scrutiny. The White House later issued an apology for the incident.

== The term &quot;operator&quot; ==
In &quot;Veritas&quot;, the Journal of Army Special Operations History, Charles H. Briscoe stated that &quot;SF did not misappropriate the appellation. Unbeknownst to most members of the ARSOF (Army Special Operations Forces) community, that moniker was adopted by Special Forces in the mid to late 1950s.&quot; He goes on to state that all qualified enlisted and officers in Special Forces had to &quot;voluntarily subscribe to the provisions of the &#x27;Code of the Special Forces Operator&#x27; and pledge themselves to its tenets by witnessed signature.&quot;

Inside the United States special operations community, an operator is a Delta Force member who has completed selection and has finished OTC (Operator Training Course). &quot;Operator&quot; was used by Delta Force to distinguish between operators (assaulters and snipers) and combat support assigned to the unit.

== Operations ==

Most operations assigned to Delta are classified, but some details have become public knowledge. For service during Operation Urgent Fury, the United States&#x27; invasion of Grenada, Delta was awarded the Joint Meritorious Unit Award. The unit was awarded the Valorous Unit Award for extraordinary heroism during the Modelo Prison hostage rescue mission and the capture of Manuel Noriega in December 1989 during Operation Just Cause in Panama. 1st SFOD-D operators from C Squadron were also involved in Operation Gothic Serpent in Somalia.

During Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, 1st SFOD-D was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for combat operations in Afghanistan from 4 October 2001 to 15 March 2002 and Iraq from 19 March 2003 to 13 December 2003.

On 26 October 2019, Delta operators accompanied by members of the 75th Ranger Regiment conducted a raid on the compound of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leading to his death.

<doc id="328810" wikidata="Q175537" url="?curid=328810" title="Symphony No. 13 (Haydn)">
<text>Joseph Haydn&#x27;s Symphony No. 13 in D major was written in 1763 for the orchestra of Haydn&#x27;s patron, Prince Nikolaus Esterházy, in Eisenstadt.

The work can be precisely dated thanks to a dated score in Haydn&#x27;s own hand in the National Library of Budapest. Two other Haydn symphonies are known to have been written in the same year: Symphony No. 12 and Symphony No. 40.

==Movements==
A typical symphony at this time was written for a pair of oboes and horns and strings, but the Eisenstadt orchestra had recently taken on two new horn players, and Haydn wrote this symphony for an expanded ensemble of one flute, two oboes, four horns, timpani and strings (violins divided into firsts and seconds, violas, cellos and double basses), with bassoon doubling the bass-line. The timpani part in the autograph score is not in Haydn&#x27;s hand, but it is quite possibly authentic: he may have written it on a separate sheet, with somebody else adding it to the score at a later date.

#Allegro molto, 
#Adagio cantabile in G major, 
#Menuet &amp; Trio (Trio in G major), 
#Finale. Allegro molto, 

The first movement opens with held chords in the winds and the strings playing a simple figure based on an arpeggio:

The movement can be considered to be in sonata form, with a repeated first half beginning in the home key of D major and modulating to A major, then a second half beginning with a development of previously heard material (passing through B minor) followed by a recapitulation of the first half, now entirely in D major (this second half also repeated). However, there is little &quot;second subject&quot; to speak of – following the key change in the first half, the music is mainly based on simple scale passages.

The second movement, marked &quot;adagio cantabile&quot; (slowly, singing), in G major, features a solo cello playing a melody against simple chords from the rest of the strings. The winds do not play in this movement. In Haydn&#x27;s day, the cello part would have been played by the principal cellist of the Eistenstadt orchestra, Joseph Franz Weigl.

The D major third movement is a minuet and trio in ternary form, with the flute prominently featured in the trio. The last movement is based around a four-note figure which sounds like the last movement of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Jupiter Symphony&quot;:

The figure, which appears in various keys throughout the movement, is treated in a manner which hints at fugue. Near the end it is heard in the strings in &quot;stretto&quot; (overlapping entries, a new one beginning before the last has ended).

A typical performance of the whole piece will last a little over twenty minutes.

<doc id="328811" wikidata="Q2086472" url="?curid=328811" title="Religious tolerance">
<text>Religious tolerance or religious toleration may signify &quot;no more than forbearance and the permission given by the adherents of a dominant religion for other religions to exist, even though the latter are looked on with disapproval as inferior, mistaken, or harmful&quot;. Historically, most incidents and writings pertaining to toleration involve the status of minority and dissenting viewpoints in relation to a dominant state religion. However, religion is also sociological, and the practice of toleration has always had a political aspect as well.

An overview of the history of toleration and different cultures in which toleration has been practiced, and the ways in which such a paradoxical concept has developed into a guiding one, illuminates its contemporary use as political, social, religious, and ethnic, applying to LGBT individuals and other minorities, and other connected concepts such as human rights.

==In Antiquity==

Religious toleration has been described as a &quot;remarkable feature&quot; of the Achaemenid Empire of Persia. Cyrus the Great assisted in the restoration of the sacred places of various cities. In the Old Testament, Cyrus was said to have released the Jews from the Babylonian captivity in 539–530 BCE, and permitted their return to their homeland.

The Hellenistic city of Alexandria, founded 331 BCE, contained a large Jewish community which lived in peace with equivalently sized Greek and Egyptian populations. According to Michael Walzer, the city provided &quot;a useful example of what we might think of as the imperial version of multiculturalism.&quot;

Before Christianity became the state church of the Roman Empire, it encouraged conquered peoples to continue worshipping their own gods. &quot;An important part of Roman propaganda was its invitation to the gods of conquered territories to enjoy the benefits of worship within the &quot;imperium&quot;.&quot; Christians were singled out for persecution because of their own rejection of Roman pantheism and refusal to honor the emperor as a god. There were some other groups that found themselves to be exceptions to Roman tolerance, such as the Druids, the early followers of the cult of Isis, the Bacchanals, the Manichaens and the priests of Cybele, and Temple Judaism was also suppressed.

In the early 3rd century, Cassius Dio outlined the Roman imperial policy towards religious tolerance:
In 311 CE, Roman Emperor Galerius issued a general edict of toleration of Christianity, in his own name and in those of Licinius and Constantine I (who converted to Christianity the following year).

Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery of the Sinai region of Egypt claims to have once had possession of an original letter of protection from Mohammed, known as the Ashtiname of Muhammad and traditionally dated to 623 CE. The monastery&#x27;s tradition holds that a Christian delegation from the Sinai requested for the continued activity of the monastery, and regional Christianity &quot;per se&quot;. The original no longer exists, but a claimed 16th century copy of it remains on display in the monastery. While several twentieth century scholars accepted the document as a legitimate original, some modern scholars now question the documentary&#x27;s authenticity.

==Buddhism==

Since the 19th century, Western intellectuals and spiritualists have viewed Buddhism as an unusually tolerant faith. James Freeman Clarke said in &quot;Ten Great Religions&quot; (1871) that &quot;Buddhists have founded no Inquisition; they have combined the zeal which converted kingdoms with a toleration almost inexplicable to our Western experience.&quot; Bhikkhu Bodhi, an American-born Buddhist convert, stated:

The Edicts of Ashoka issued by King Ashoka the Great (269–231 BCE), a Buddhist, declared ethnic and religious tolerance. His Edict in the 12th main stone writing of Girnar on the third century BCE which state that &quot;Kings accepted religious tolerance and that Emperor Ashoka maintained that no one would consider his / her is to be superior to other and rather would follow a path of unity by accuring the essence of other religions&quot;.

However, Buddhism has also had controversies regarding toleration. In addition, the question of possible intolerance among Buddhists in Sri Lanka and Myanmar has been raised by Paul Fuller.

==Christianity==

The books of Exodus, Leviticus and Deuteronomy make similar statements about the treatment of strangers. For example, Exodus 22:21 says: &quot;Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt&quot;. These texts are frequently used in sermons to plead for compassion and tolerance of those who are different from us and less powerful. Julia Kristeva elucidated a philosophy of political and religious toleration based on all of our mutual identities as strangers.

The New Testament Parable of the Tares, which speaks of the difficulty of distinguishing wheat from weeds before harvest time, has also been invoked in support of religious toleration. In his &quot;Letter to Bishop Roger of Chalons&quot;, Bishop Wazo of Liege (c. 985–1048) relied on the parable to argue that &quot;the church should let dissent grow with orthodoxy until the Lord comes to separate and judge them&quot;.

Roger Williams used this parable to support government toleration of all of the &quot;weeds&quot; (heretics) in the world, because civil persecution often inadvertently hurts the &quot;wheat&quot; (believers) too. Instead, Williams believed it was God&#x27;s duty to judge in the end, not man&#x27;s. This parable lent further support to Williams&#x27; belief in a wall of separation between church and state as described in his 1644 book, &quot;The Bloody Tenent of Persecution&quot;.

===Middle Ages===
In the Middle Ages, there were instances of toleration of particular groups. The Latin concept &quot;tolerantia&quot; was a &quot;highly-developed political and judicial concept in medieval scholastic theology and canon law.&quot; &quot;Tolerantia&quot; was used to &quot;denote the self-restraint of a civil power in the face of&quot; outsiders, like infidels, Muslims or Jews, but also in the face of social groups like prostitutes and lepers. Heretics such as the Cathari, Waldensians, Jan Hus, and his followers, the Hussites, were persecuted. Later theologians belonging or reacting to the Protestant Reformation began discussion of the circumstances under which dissenting religious thought should be permitted. Toleration &quot;as a government-sanctioned practice&quot; in Christian countries, &quot;the sense on which most discussion of the phenomenon relies—is not attested before the sixteenth century&quot;.

====Unam sanctam and Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus====
Centuries of Roman Catholic intoleration of other faiths was exemplified by &quot;Unam sanctam&quot;, a papal bull issued by Pope Boniface VIII on 18 November 1302. The bull laid down dogmatic propositions on the unity of the Catholic Church, the necessity of belonging to it for eternal salvation (&quot;Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus&quot;), the position of the Pope as supreme head of the Church, and the duty thence arising of submission to the Pope in order to belong to the Church and thus to attain salvation. The bull ends, &quot;Furthermore, we declare, we proclaim, we define that it is absolutely necessary for salvation that every human creature be subject to the Roman Pontiff.&quot;

====Tolerance of the Jews====

In Poland in 1264, the Statute of Kalisz was issued, guaranteeing freedom of religion for the Jews in the country.

In 1348, Pope Clement VI (1291–1352) issued a bull pleading with Catholics not to murder Jews, whom they blamed for the Black Death. He noted that Jews died of the plague like anyone else, and that the disease also flourished in areas where there were no Jews. Christians who blamed and killed Jews had been &quot;seduced by that liar, the Devil&quot;. He took Jews under his personal protection at Avignon, but his calls for other clergy to do so failed to be heeded.

Johann Reuchlin (1455–1522) was a German humanist and a scholar of Greek and Hebrew who opposed efforts by Johannes Pfefferkorn, backed by the Dominicans of Cologne, to confiscate all religious texts from the Jews as a first step towards their forcible conversion to the Catholic religion.

Despite occasional spontaneous episodes of pogroms and killings, as during the Black Death, Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was a relatively tolerant home for the Jews in the medieval period. In 1264, the Statute of Kalisz guaranteed safety, personal liberties, freedom of religion, trade, and travel to Jews. By the mid-16th century, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was home to 80% of the world&#x27;s Jewish population. Jewish worship was officially recognized, with a Chief Rabbi originally appointed by the monarch. Jewish property ownership was also protected for much of the period, and Jews entered into business partnerships with members of the nobility.

====Vladimiri====
Paulus Vladimiri (c. 1370–1435) was a Polish scholar and rector who at the Council of Constance in 1414, presented a thesis, &quot;Tractatus de potestate papae et respectu infidelium&quot; (Treatise on the Power of the Pope and the Emperor Respecting Infidels). In it he argued that pagan and Christian nations could coexist in peace and criticized the Teutonic Order for its wars of conquest of native non-Christian peoples in Prussia and Lithuania. Vladimiri strongly supported the idea of conciliarism and pioneered the notion of peaceful coexistence among nations—a forerunner of modern theories of human rights. Throughout his political, diplomatic and university career, he expressed the view that a world guided by the principles of peace and mutual respect among nations was possible and that pagan nations had a right to peace and to possession of their own lands.

====Erasmus====

Desiderius Erasmus Roterodamus (1466–1536), was a Dutch Renaissance humanist and Catholic whose works laid a foundation for religious toleration. For example, in &quot;De libero arbitrio&quot;, opposing certain views of Martin Luther, Erasmus noted that religious disputants should be temperate in their language, &quot;because in this way the truth, which is often lost amidst too much wrangling may be more surely perceived.&quot; Gary Remer writes, &quot;Like Cicero, Erasmus concludes that truth is furthered by a more harmonious relationship between interlocutors.&quot; Although Erasmus did not oppose the punishment of heretics, in individual cases he generally argued for moderation and against the death penalty. He wrote, &quot;It is better to cure a sick man than to kill him.&quot;

====More====
Saint Thomas More (1478–1535), Catholic Lord Chancellor of King Henry VIII and author, described a world of almost complete religious toleration in Utopia (1516), in which the Utopians &quot;can hold various religious beliefs without persecution from the authorities.&quot; However, More&#x27;s work is subject to various interpretations, and it is not clear that he felt that earthly society should be conducted the same way as in Utopia. Thus, in his three years as Lord Chancellor, More actively approved of the persecution of those who sought to undermine the Catholic faith in England.

===Reformation===
At the Diet of Worms (1521), Martin Luther refused to recant his beliefs citing freedom of conscience as his justification. According to Historian Hermann August Winkler, the individual&#x27;s freedom of conscience became the hallmark of Protestantism. Luther was convinced that faith in Jesus Christ was the free gift of the Holy Spirit and could therefore not be forced on a person. Heresies could not be met with force, but with preaching the gospel revealed in the Bible. Luther: &quot;Heretics should not be overcome with fire, but with written sermons.&quot; In Luther&#x27;s view, the worldly authorities were entitled to expel heretics. Only if they undermine the public order, should they be executed. Later proponents of tolerance such as Sebastian Franck and Sebastian Castellio cited Luther&#x27;s position. He had overcome, at least for the Protestant territories and countries, the violent medieval criminal procedures of dealing with heretics. But Luther remained rooted in the Middle Ages insofar as he considered the Anabaptists&#x27; refusal to take oaths, do military service, and the rejection of private property by some Anabaptist groups to be a &quot;political&quot; threat to the public order which would inevitably lead to anarchy and chaos. So Anabaptists were persecuted not only in Catholic but also in Lutheran and Reformed territories. However, a number of Protestant theologians such as John Calvin, Martin Bucer, Wolfgang Capito, and Johannes Brenz as well as Landgrave Philip of Hesse opposed the execution of Anabaptists. Ulrich Zwingli demanded the expulsion of persons who did not accept the Reformed beliefs, in some cases the execution of Anabaptist leaders. The young Michael Servetus also defended tolerance since 1531, in his letters to Johannes Oecolampadius, but during those years some Protestant theologians such as Bucer and Capito publicly expressed they thought he should be persecuted. The trial against Servetus, an Antitrinitarian, in Geneva was not a case of church discipline but a criminal procedure based on the legal code of the Holy Roman Empire. Denying the Trinity doctrine was long considered to be the same as atheism in all churches. The Anabaptists made a considerable contribution to the development of tolerance in the early-modern era by incessantly demanding freedom of conscience and standing up for it with their patient suffering.

====Castellio====

Sebastian Castellio (1515–1563) was a French Protestant theologian who in 1554 published under a pseudonym the pamphlet &quot;Whether heretics should be persecuted (De haereticis, an sint persequendi)&quot; criticizing John Calvin&#x27;s execution of Michael Servetus: &quot;When Servetus fought with reasons and writings, he should have been repulsed by reasons and writings.&quot; Castellio concluded: &quot;We can live together peacefully only when we control our intolerance. Even though there will always be differences of opinion from time to time, we can at any rate come to general understandings, can love one another, and can enter the bonds of peace, pending the day when we shall attain unity of faith.&quot; Castellio is remembered for the often quoted statement, &quot;To kill a man is not to protect a doctrine, but it is to kill a man.

====Bodin====
Jean Bodin (1530–1596) was a French Catholic jurist and political philosopher. His Latin work &quot;Colloquium heptaplomeres de rerum sublimium arcanis abditis&quot; (&quot;The Colloqium of the Seven&quot;) portrays a conversation about the nature of truth between seven cultivated men from diverse religious or philosophical backgrounds: a natural philosopher, a Calvinist, a Muslim, a Roman Catholic, a Lutheran, a Jew, and a skeptic. All agree to live in mutual respect and tolerance.

====Montaigne====
Michel de Montaigne (1533–1592), French Catholic essayist and statesman, moderated between the Catholic and Protestant sides in the Wars of Religion. Montaigne&#x27;s theory of skepticism led to the conclusion that we cannot precipitously decide the error of others&#x27; views. Montaigne wrote in his famous &quot;Essais&quot;: &quot;It is putting a very high value on one&#x27;s conjectures, to have a man roasted alive because of them...To kill people, there must be sharp and brilliant clarity.&quot;

====Edict of Torda====

In 1568, King John II Sigismund of Hungary, encouraged by his Unitarian Minister Francis David (Dávid Ferenc), issued the Edict of Torda decreeing religious toleration of all Christian denominations except Romanian Orthodoxy. It did not apply to Jews or Muslims but was nevertheless an extraordinary achievement of religious tolerance by the standards of 16th-century Europe.

====Maximilian II====
In 1571, Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II granted religious toleration to the nobles of Lower Austria, their families and workers.

====The Warsaw Confederation, 1573====

The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth had a long tradition of religious freedom. The right to worship freely was a basic right given to all inhabitants of the Commonwealth throughout the 15th and early 16th centuries, however complete freedom of religion was officially recognized in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1573 in the Warsaw Confederation. The Commonwealth kept religious-freedom laws during an era when religious persecution was an everyday occurrence in the rest of Europe.

The Warsaw Confederation was a private compact signed by representatives of all the major religions in Polish and Lithuanian society, in which they pledged each other mutual support and tolerance. The confederation was incorporated into the Henrican articles, which constituted a virtual Polish–Lithuanian constitution.

====Edict of Nantes====
The Edict of Nantes, issued on April 13, 1598, by Henry IV of France, granted Protestants—notably Calvinist Huguenots—substantial rights in a nation where Catholicism was the state religion. The main concern was civil unity—the edict separated civil law from religious rights, treated non-Catholics as more than mere schismatics and heretics for the first time, and opened a path for secularism and tolerance. In offering general freedom of conscience to individuals, the edict offered many specific concessions to the Protestants, such as amnesty and the reinstatement of their civil rights, including the right to work in any field or for the State, and to bring grievances directly to the king. The edict marked the end of the religious wars in France that tore apart the population during the second half of the 16th century.

The Edict of Nantes was revoked in 1685 by King Louis XIV with the Edict of Fontainebleau, leading to renewed persecution of Protestants in France. Although strict enforcement of the revocation was relaxed during the reign of Louis XV, it was not until 102 years later, in 1787, when Louis XVI signed the Edict of Versailles—known as the Edict of Tolerance—that civil status and rights to form congregations by Protestants were restored.

===The Enlightenment===
Beginning in the Enlightenment commencing in the 1600s, politicians and commentators began formulating theories of religious toleration and basing legal codes on the concept. A distinction began to develop between &quot;civil tolerance&quot;, concerned with &quot;the policy of the state towards religious dissent&quot;., and &quot;ecclesiastical tolerance&quot;, concerned with the degree of diversity tolerated within a particular church.

====Milton====

John Milton (1608–1674), English Protestant poet and essayist, called in the &quot;Areopagitica&quot; for &quot;the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties&quot; (applied, however, only to the conflicting Protestant denominations, and not to atheists, Jews, Muslims or even Catholics). &quot;Milton argued for disestablishment as the only effective way of achieving broad toleration. Rather than force a man&#x27;s conscience, government should recognize the persuasive force of the gospel.&quot;

====Rudolph II====
In 1609, Rudolph II decreed religious toleration in Bohemia.

====In the American colonies====

In 1636, Roger Williams and companions at the foundation of Rhode Island entered into a compact binding themselves &quot;to be obedient to the majority only in civil things&quot;. Williams spoke of &quot;democracie or popular government.&quot; Lucian Johnston writes, &quot;Williams&#x27; intention was to grant an infinitely greater religious liberty than what existed anywhere in the world outside of the Colony of Maryland.&quot; In 1663, Charles II granted the colony a charter guaranteeing complete religious toleration.

Also in 1636, Congregationalist Thomas Hooker and a group of companions founded Connecticut. They combined the democratic form of government that had been developed by the Separatist Congregationalists in Plymouth Colony (Pilgrim Fathers) with unlimited freedom of conscience. Like Martin Luther, Hooker argued that as faith in Jesus Christ was the free gift of the Holy Spirit it could not be forced on a person.

In 1649 Maryland passed the Maryland Toleration Act, also known as the Act Concerning Religion, a law mandating religious tolerance for Trinitarian Christians only (excluding Nontrinitarian faiths). Passed on September 21, 1649 by the assembly of the Maryland colony, it was the first law requiring religious tolerance in the British North American colonies. The Calvert family sought enactment of the law to protect Catholic settlers and some of the other denominations that did not conform to the dominant Anglicanism of England and her colonies.

In 1657, New Amsterdam, governed by Dutch Calvinists, granted religious toleration to Jews. They had fled from Portuguese persecution in Brazil.

In the Province of Pennsylvania, William Penn and his fellow Quakers heavily imprinted their religious values of toleration on the Pennsylvania government. The Pennsylvania 1701 Charter of Privileges extended religious freedom to all monotheists, and government was open to all Christians.

====Spinoza====

Baruch Spinoza (1632–1677) was a Dutch Jewish philosopher. He published the Theological-Political Treatise anonymously in 1670, arguing (according to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) that &quot;the freedom to philosophize can not only be granted without injury to piety and the peace of the Commonwealth, but that the peace of the Commonwealth and Piety are endangered by the suppression of this freedom&quot;, and defending, &quot;as a political ideal, the tolerant, secular, and democratic polity&quot;. After interpreting certain Biblical texts, Spinoza opted for tolerance and freedom of thought in his conclusion that &quot;every person is in duty bound to adapt these religious dogmas to his own understanding and to interpret them for himself in whatever way makes him feel that he can the more readily accept them with full confidence and conviction.&quot;

====Locke====
English philosopher John Locke (1632–1704) published A Letter Concerning Toleration in 1689. Locke&#x27;s work appeared amidst a fear that Catholicism might be taking over England, and responds to the problem of religion and government by proposing religious toleration as the answer.
Unlike Thomas Hobbes, who saw uniformity of religion as the key to a well-functioning civil society, Locke argued that more religious groups actually prevent civil unrest. In his opinion, civil unrest results from confrontations caused by any magistrate&#x27;s attempt to prevent different religions from being practiced, rather than tolerating their proliferation. However, Locke denies religious tolerance for Catholics, for political reasons, and also for atheists because &quot;Promises, covenants, and oaths, which are the bonds of human society, can have no hold upon an atheist&quot;. A passage Locke later added to &quot;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot; questioned whether atheism was necessarily inimical to political obedience.

====Bayle====

Pierre Bayle (1647–1706) was a French Protestant scholar and philosopher who went into exile in Holland. In his &quot;Dictionnaire Historique et Critique&quot; and &quot;Commentaire Philosophique&quot; he advanced arguments for religious toleration (though, like some others of his time, he was not anxious to extend the same protection to Catholics he would to differing Protestant sects). Among his arguments were that every church believes it is the right one so &quot;a heretical church would be in a position to persecute the true church&quot;. Bayle wrote that &quot;the erroneous conscience procures for error the same rights and privileges that the orthodox conscience procures for truth.&quot;

Bayle was repelled by the use of scripture to justify coercion and violence: &quot;One must transcribe almost the whole New Testament to collect all the Proofs it affords us of that Gentleness and Long-suffering, which constitute the distinguishing and essential Character of the Gospel.&quot; He did not regard toleration as a danger to the state, but to the contrary: &quot;If the Multiplicity of Religions prejudices the State, it proceeds from their not bearing with one another but on the contrary endeavoring each to crush and destroy the other by methods of Persecution. In a word, all the Mischief arises not from Toleration, but from the want of it.&quot;

====English Toleration Act 1688====
Following the Glorious Revolution, when the Dutch king William came to the English throne, the Toleration Act 1688 adopted by the English Parliament allowed freedom of worship to Nonconformists who had pledged to the oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy and rejected transubstantiation. The Nonconformists were Protestants who dissented from the Church of England such as Baptists and Congregationalists. They were allowed their own places of worship and their own teachers, if they accepted certain oaths of allegiance. The Act, however, did not apply to Catholics and non-trinitarians, and continued the existing social and political disabilities of Dissenters, including their exclusion from political office and from the universities of Oxford and Cambridge.

====Voltaire====

François-Marie Arouet, the French writer, historian and philosopher known as Voltaire (1694–1778) published his &quot;Treatise on Toleration&quot; in 1763. In it he attacked religious views, but also said, &quot;It does not require great art, or magnificently trained eloquence, to prove that Christians should tolerate each other. I, however, am going further: I say that we should regard all men as our brothers. What? The Turk my brother? The Chinaman my brother? The Jew? The Siam? Yes, without doubt; are we not all children of the same father and creatures of the same God?&quot; On the other hand, Voltaire in his writings on religion was spiteful and intolerant of the practice of the Christian religion, and Orthodox rabbi Joseph Telushkin has claimed that the most significant of Enlightenment hostility against Judaism was found in Voltaire.

====Lessing====
Gotthold Ephraim Lessing (1729–1781), German dramatist and philosopher, trusted in a &quot;Christianity of Reason&quot;, in which human reason (initiated by criticism and dissent) would develop, even without help by divine revelation. His plays about Jewish characters and themes, such as &quot;Die Juden&quot; and &quot;Nathan der Weise&quot;, &quot;have usually been considered impressive pleas for social and religious toleration&quot;. The latter work contains the famous parable of the three rings, in which three sons represent the three Abrahamic religions, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. Each son believes he has the one true ring passed down by their father, but judgment on which is correct is reserved to God.

====French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen====

The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (1789), adopted by the National Constituent Assembly during the French Revolution, states in Article 10: &quot;No-one shall be interfered with for his opinions, even religious ones, provided that their practice does not disturb public order as established by the law.&quot; (&quot;Nul ne doit être inquiété pour ses opinions, mêmes religieuses, pourvu que leur manifestation ne trouble pas l&#x27;ordre public établi par la loi.&quot;) Napoleon emancipated the Jews in countries his imperial army conquered, expanding the impact of the French Declaration of Rights of Man.

====The First Amendment to the United States Constitution====

The First Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified along with the rest of the Bill of Rights on December 15, 1791, included the following words: &quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...&quot;
In 1802, Thomas Jefferson wrote a letter to the Danbury Baptists Association in which he said:
&quot;...I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should &#x27;make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,&#x27; thus building a wall of separation between Church &amp; State.&quot;

===In the nineteenth century===
The process of legislating religious toleration went unevenly forward, while philosophers continued to discuss the underlying rationale.

====Roman Catholic Relief Act====
The Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 adopted by the Parliament in 1829 repealed the last of the civil restrictions aimed at Catholic citizens of the United Kingdom.

====Mill====
John Stuart Mill&#x27;s arguments in &quot;On Liberty&quot; (1859) in support of the freedom of speech were phrased to include a defense of religious toleration:
 Let the opinions impugned be the belief of God and in a future state, or any of the commonly received doctrines of morality... But I must be permitted to observe that it is not the feeling sure of a doctrine (be it what it may) which I call an assumption of infallibility. It is the undertaking to decide that question &quot;for others&quot;, without allowing them to hear what can be said on the contrary side. And I denounce and reprobate this pretension not the less if it is put forth on the side of my most solemn convictions.

====Syllabus of Errors====
The Syllabus of Errors was issued by Pope Pius IX in 1864. It condemns 80 errors or heresies, including the following propositions regarding religious toleration:
====Renan====

In his 1882 essay &quot;What is a Nation?&quot;, French historian and philosopher Ernest Renan proposed a definition of nationhood based on &quot;a spiritual principle&quot; involving shared memories, rather than a common religious, racial or linguistic heritage. Thus members of any religious group could participate fully in the life of the nation. &quot;You can be French, English, German, yet Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, or practicing no religion&quot;.

===In the twentieth century===
In 1948, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states:
 Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance
Even though not formally legally binding, the Declaration has been adopted in or influenced many national constitutions since 1948. It also serves as the foundation for a growing number of international treaties and national laws and international, regional, national and sub-national institutions protecting and promoting human rights including the freedom of religion.

In 1965, the Catholic Vatican II Council issued the decree &quot;Dignitatis humanae&quot; (Religious Freedom) that states that all people must have the right to religious freedom. The Catholic 1983 Code of Canon Law states:
In 1986, the first World Day of Prayer for Peace was held in Assisi. Representatives of one hundred and twenty different religions came together for prayer.

In 1988, in the spirit of Glasnost, Soviet general secretary Mikhail Gorbachev promised increased religious toleration.

==Hinduism==
The Rigveda says &quot;Ekam Sath Viprah Bahudha Vadanti&quot; which translates to &quot;The truth is One, but sages call it by different Names&quot;. Consistent with this tradition, India chose to be a secular country even though it was divided by partitioning on religious lines. Whatever intolerance Hindu scholars displayed towards other religions was subtle and symbolic and most likely was done to present a superior argument in defence of their own faith. Traditionally, Hindus showed their intolerance by withdrawing and avoiding contact with those whom they held in contempt, instead of using violence and aggression to strike fear in their hearts.
Pluralism and tolerance of diversity are built into Hindu theology. India&#x27;s long history is a testimony to its tolerance of religious diversity. Christianity came to India with St. Thomas in the first century CE, long before it became popular in the West. Judaism came to India after the Jewish temple was destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE and the Jews were expelled from their homeland. In a recent book titled &quot;Who are the Jews of India?&quot; (University of California Press, 2000), author Nathan Katz observes that India is the only country where the Jews were not persecuted. The Indian chapter is one of the happiest of the Jewish Diaspora. Both Christians and Jews have existed in a predominant Hindu India for centuries without being persecuted. Zoroastrians from Persia (present day Iran) entered India in the 7th century to flee Islamic conquest. They are known as Parsis in India. The Parsis are an affluent community in the city of Mumbai. Once treated as foreigners, they remain a minority community, yet still housing the richest business families in India; for example, the Tata family controls a huge industrial empire in various parts of the country. Mrs. Indira Gandhi, the powerful Prime Minister of India (1966–77; 1980–84), was married to Feroz Gandhi, a Parsi (no relation to Mahatma Gandhi).
==Islam==

=== Religious tolerance in Quran ===
Islam is an Abrahamic, One of the Quranic verses that deals with religious freedom is, “If your Lord had so wished, everyone on earth would have believed, all of them together! So will you force mankind to become believers?’. The verse advocates for man’s freedom of will. The words of Quran are regarded as the absolute truth, and human beings are called upon to utilize their conscience to recognize this truth, and follow this religion based on their own conviction. The verse also acts as a caution to the believers of Islam against employing any sort of physical, social or financial coercion relating to the matter of faith. Prophet Muhammad was commanded against utilizing any force for submission. He was instructed to, “Invite [people] to your Lord’s way with discretion and kindly instruction, and discuss [things] with them in the politest manner. Your Lord is quite aware as to who has strayed from His path, just as He is quite aware of those who have consented to be guided.” The prescribed method of communication with individuals from other faiths is through a wise dialogue and good advice.

Islam demonstrates a profound tolerance towards the people of the book, encompassing the Abrahamic religions, i.e., Christianity and Judaism. The Quran contains numerous verses that emphasize the status and respect toward the people of the book. The Quran invites Christians and Jews diplomatically and respectfully. However, if they reject the call, the Quran still recognizes them as the people of the book, who are described with good manners and deeds. Similarly, the Quran gives equal status to worship places, for example, monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques. Islam further continues in religious tolerance towards Christians and Jews by making family connections with different religious groups. For instance, in the Quran chapter of Maida verse 5 states that Muslim men are allowed to marry the women of the book without putting any condition on their conversion. However, there is a silence in the Quran regarding the marriage of Muslim women to the men of the book.

While Islam has plenty of references regarding the religious tolerance towards Christians and Jews, there is not much reference in the Quran regarding non-Abrahamic religions such as pagans or, for example, Hindus and Buddhists. With a reductionist approach, it can be concluded that Islam does not force anyone to their choice of faith. However, it also discourages Muslims from having strong ties with pagans, such as marriage; Muslims are not allowed to marry pagan men or women.

The Quran, albeit having given importance to its &#x27;true believers&#x27;, commands its followers to tolerate &#x27;the people of all faiths and communities&#x27; and to let them command their dignity, without breaking the Shariah law.

Certain verses of the Quran were interpreted to create a specially tolerated status for People of the Book, Jewish and Christian believers in the Old and New Testaments considered to have been a basis for Islamic religion:
Verily! Those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians, whoever believes in God and the Last Day and do righteous good deeds shall have their reward with their Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.
Under Islamic law, Jews and Christians were considered &quot;dhimmis&quot;, a legal status inferior to that of a Muslim but superior to that of other non-Muslims.

Jewish communities in the Ottoman Empire held a protected status and continued to practice their own religion, as did Christians, though both were subject to additional restrictions, such as restrictions on the areas where they could live or work or in clothing, and both had to pay additional taxes. Yitzhak Sarfati, born in Germany, became the Chief Rabbi of Edirne and wrote a letter inviting European Jews to settle in the Ottoman Empire, in which he asked: &quot;Is it not better for you to live under Muslims than under Christians?&#x27;&quot;. Sultan Beyazid II (1481–1512), issued a formal invitation to the Jews expelled from Catholic Spain and Portugal, leading to a wave of Jewish immigration.

According to Michael Walzer:
The established religion of the [Ottoman] empire was Islam, but three other religious communities—Greek Orthodox, Armenian Orthodox, and Jewish—were permitted to form autonomous organizations. These three were equal among themselves, without regard to their relative numerical strength. They were subject to the same restrictions vis-à-vis Muslims—with regard to dress, proselytizing, and intermarriage, for example—and were allowed the same legal control over their own members.

=== Prohibition on access to holy places ===
According to the interpretation of the Quran, non-Muslims should not access the holiest places, namely Mecca and Medina mosques. Since the 9th year of Prophet Muhammad’s migration, the Pagans were not allowed to perform pilgrimage around Kaߵba. Moreover, they were not allowed to occupy the mosques and the worshiping places of the Muslims. In chapter, The Repentance al-Tawba, Allah says to Muhammad, “O believers! Indeed, the polytheists are ˹spiritually˺ impure, so they should not approach the Sacred Mosque after this year.”

Based on the interpretation of Abu Hayyan al-Andalusi, “polytheists” are the unbelievers, which does not include the people of the book, i.e., Christians and Jews, who are monotheists. Abu Hayyan’s exegesis aligns with the Jurisprudence of Abu Hanifa, the founder of one of the four Islamic Law schools, allowing Christians and Jews to access mosques. The scholars also emphasized that the “impurity” that is mentioned in the Quran is meant in an allegorical way. Those who are spiritually impure should not enter the Sacred places. They support their argument that the people of the book cannot be considered impure by the Quran because elsewhere in the book, the believers are allowed to eat food of the people of the book, as it is halal (religiously permissible).

However, the Maliki school used analogy qiyas to conclude that every non-Muslim, including the People of the Book, are unbeliever and, therefore, should not access the sacred places. They also made an analogy between the Holy Mosque and all other mosques. Based on this interpretation, many modern Muslims believe that they can pray anywhere as long as they face Mecca and the place is pure.

=== Religious tolerance in Medieval Iberia ===
In Al-Andalus (Andalusia), from the 8th to the 15th centuries, under Muslim rule, a degree of  religious tolerance was granted to Christians and Jews. This part of history is known for its supposed religious tolerance, especially under the Umayyad Caliphate where many cultural and intellectual achievements were made. Under this Islamic rule, non-Muslims were known as ‘dhimmi’ and Christians and Jews were granted certain protections whilst given the right to practice their faith in exchange for a tax, called jizya. However, the People of the Book are treated as second class citizens    

The term Convivencia (co-existence) was coined by Americo Castro in the 1940s, to describe how the three religions lived together peacefully during this time. However, many scholars point out the oversimplification of this phenomenon. On one hand, there is the belief of the medieval Iberian Peninsula as a cross- cultural, peaceful era and on the other, it has been characterized as a place of conflict, not cooperation.

==Judaism==
Jews have been among the most persecuted group in the world and have faced waves of discrimination as early as 605 BCE, when Jews who lived in the Neo-Babylonian Empire were persecuted and deported. During the Spanish Inquisition, royal decrees to force the conversion to Christianity led to mass expulsion of Jews from Spain. A major target of the Portuguese Inquisition were the conversos, Jews who converted to Christianity and were accused of practicing Crypto-Judaism.

Jews have also been used as scapegoats for tragedies and shortcomings, such as those seen in the Black Death Persecutions, the 1066 Granada Massacre, Expulsions from Europe and the Middle East, the Massacre of 1391 in Spain, the many Pogroms in the Russian Empire, and the tenets of Nazism prior to and during World War II, which lead to the Holocaust and the murder of six million Jews. In the post-war era, Jews were the subject of purges in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin, beginning in 1948. Stalin had plans to deport the entire Jewish population in the Soviet Union to Siberia.

==Modern analyses and critiques==
Contemporary commentators have highlighted situations in which toleration conflicts with widely held moral standards, national law, the principles of national identity, or other strongly held goals. Michael Walzer notes that the British in India tolerated the Hindu practice of suttee (ritual burning of a widow) until 1829. On the other hand, the United States declined to tolerate the Mormon practice of polygamy. The French head scarf controversy represents a conflict between religious practice and the French secular ideal. Toleration of the Romani people in European countries is a continuing issue.

===Modern definition===
Historian Alexandra Walsham notes that the modern understanding of the word &quot;toleration&quot; may be very different from its historic meaning. Toleration in modern parlance has been analyzed as a component of a liberal or libertarian view of human rights. Hans Oberdiek writes, &quot;As long as no one is harmed or no one&#x27;s fundamental rights are violated, the state should keep hands off, tolerating what those controlling the state find disgusting, deplorable or even debased. This for a long time has been the most prevalent defense of toleration by liberals... It is found, for example, in the writings of American philosophers John Rawls, Robert Nozick, Ronald Dworkin, Brian Barry, and a Canadian, Will Kymlicka, among others.&quot;

Isaiah Berlin attributes to Herbert Butterfield the notion that &quot;toleration... implies a certain disrespect. I tolerate your absurd beliefs and your foolish acts, though I know them to be absurd and foolish. Mill would, I think, have agreed.&quot;

John Gray states that &quot;When we tolerate a practice, a belief or a character trait, we let something be that we judge to be undesirable, false or at least inferior; our toleration expresses the conviction that, despite its badness, the object of toleration should be left alone.&quot; However, according to Gray, &quot;new liberalism—the
liberalism of Rawls, Dworkin, Ackerman and suchlike&quot; seems to imply that &quot;it is wrong for government to discriminate in favour of, or against, any form of life animated by a definite conception of the good.&quot;

===Tolerating the intolerant===

Walzer, Karl Popper and John Rawls have discussed the paradox of tolerating intolerance. Walzer asks &quot;Should we tolerate the intolerant?&quot; He notes that most minority religious groups who are the beneficiaries of tolerance are themselves intolerant, at least in some respects. Rawls argues that an intolerant sect should be tolerated in a tolerant society unless the sect directly threatens the security of other members of the society. He links this principle to the stability of a tolerant society, in which members of an intolerant sect in a tolerant society will, over time, acquire the tolerance of the wider society.

===Other criticisms and issues===
Toleration has been described as undermining itself via moral relativism: &quot;either the claim self-referentially undermines itself or it provides us with no compelling reason to believe it. If we are skeptical about knowledge, then we have no way of knowing that toleration is good.&quot;

Ronald Dworkin argues that in exchange for toleration, minorities must bear with the criticisms and insults which are part of the freedom of speech in an otherwise tolerant society. Dworkin has also questioned whether the United States is a &quot;tolerant secular&quot; nation, or is re-characterizing itself as a &quot;tolerant religious&quot; nation, based on the increasing re-introduction of religious themes into conservative politics. Dworkin concludes that &quot;the tolerant secular model is preferable, although he invited people to use the concept of personal responsibility to argue in favor of the tolerant religious model.&quot;

In &quot;The End of Faith&quot;, Sam Harris asserts that society should be unwilling to tolerate unjustified religious beliefs about morality, spirituality, politics, and the origin of humanity, especially beliefs which promote violence.

<text>Theistic evolution (also known as theistic evolutionism or God-guided evolution), alternatively called evolutionary creationism, is a view that God acts and creates through laws of nature. Here, God is taken as the primary cause while natural causes are secondary, positing that the concept of God and religious beliefs are compatible with the findings of modern science, including evolution. Theistic evolution is not in itself a scientific theory, but includes a range of views about how science relates to religious beliefs and the extent to which God intervenes. It rejects the strict creationist doctrines of special creation, but can include beliefs such as creation of the human soul. Modern theistic evolution accepts the general scientific consensus on the age of the Earth, the age of the universe, the Big Bang, the origin of the Solar System, the origin of life, and evolution.

Supporters of theistic evolution generally attempt to harmonize evolutionary thought with belief in God and reject the conflict between religion and science; they hold that religious beliefs and scientific theories do not need to contradict each other. Diversity exists regarding how the two concepts of faith and science fit together.

==Definition==
Francis Collins describes theistic evolution as the position that &quot;evolution is real, but that it was set in motion by God&quot;, and characterizes it as accepting &quot;that evolution occurred as biologists describe it, but under the direction of God&quot;. He lists six general premises on which different versions of theistic evolution typically rest. They include:
# The prevailing cosmological model, with the universe coming into being about 13.8 billion years ago;
# The fine-tuned universe;
# Evolution and natural selection;
# No special supernatural intervention is involved once evolution got under way;
# Humans are a result of these evolutionary processes; and
# Despite all these, humans are unique. The concern for the Moral Law (the knowledge of right and wrong) and the continuous search for God among all human cultures defy evolutionary explanations and point to our spiritual nature.

The executive director of the National Center for Science Education in the United States of America, Eugenie Scott, has used the term to refer to the part of the overall spectrum of beliefs about creation and evolution holding the theological view that God creates through evolution. It covers a wide range of beliefs about the extent of any intervention by God, with some approaching deism in rejecting the concepts of continued intervention or special creation, while others believe that God has directly intervened at crucial points such as the origin of humans.

In the Catholic version of theistic evolution, human evolution may have occurred, but God must create the human soul, and the creation story in the book of Genesis should be read metaphorically.

Some Muslims believe that only humans were exceptions to common ancestry (human exceptionalism), while some give an allegorical reading of Adam&#x27;s creation (Non-exceptionalism). Some Muslims believe that only Adam and Hawa (Eve) were special creations and they alongside their earliest descendants were exceptions to common ancestry, but the later descendants (including modern humans) share common ancestry with the rest of life on Earth because there were &quot;human-like&quot; beings on Earth before Adam&#x27;s arrival who came through evolution. This belief is known as &quot;Adamic exceptionalism&quot;.

When evolutionary science developed, so did different types of theistic evolution. Creationists Henry M. Morris and John D. Morris have listed different terms which were used to describe different positions from the 1890s to the 1920s: &quot;Orthogenesis&quot; (goal-directed evolution), &quot;nomogenesis&quot; (evolution according to fixed law), &quot;emergent evolution&quot;, &quot;creative evolution&quot;, and others.

The Jesuit paleontologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (1881–1955) was an influential proponent of God-directed evolution or &quot;orthogenesis&quot;, in which man will eventually evolve to the &quot;omega point&quot; of union with the Creator.

=== Alternative terms ===
Others see &quot;evolutionary creation&quot; (EC, also referred to by some observers as &quot;evolutionary creationism&quot;) as the belief that God, as Creator, uses evolution to bring about his plan. Eugenie Scott states in &quot;Evolution Vs. Creationism&quot; that it is a type of evolution rather than creationism, despite its name. &quot;From a scientific point of view, evolutionary creationism is hardly distinguishable from Theistic Evolution ... [the differences] lie not in science but in theology.&quot; Those who hold to evolutionary creationism argue that God is involved to a greater extent than the theistic evolutionist believes.

Canadian biologist Denis Lamoureux published a 2003 article and a 2008 theological book, both aimed at Christians who do not believe in evolution (including young Earth creationists), and at those looking to reconcile their Christian faith with evolutionary science. His main argument was that Genesis presents the &quot;science and history of the day&quot; as &quot;incidental vessels&quot; to convey spiritual truths. Lamoureux rewrote his article as a 2009 journal paper, incorporating excerpts from his books, in which he noted the similarities of his views to theistic evolution, but objected to that term as making evolution the focus rather than creation. He also distanced his beliefs from the deistic or more liberal beliefs included in theistic evolution. He also argued that although referring to the same view, the word arrangement in the term &quot;theistic evolution&quot; places &quot;the process of evolution as the primary term, and makes the Creator secondary as merely a qualifying adjective&quot;.

Divine intervention is seen at critical intervals in history in a way consistent with scientific explanations of speciation, with similarities to the ideas of progressive creationism that God created &quot;kinds&quot; of animals sequentially.

Regarding the embracing of Darwinian evolution, historian Ronald Numbers describes the position of the late 19th-century geologist George Frederick Wright as &quot;Christian Darwinism&quot;.

Jacob Klapwijk and Howard J. Van Till have, while accepting both theistic creation and evolution, rejected the term &quot;theistic evolution&quot;.

In 2006, American geneticist and Director of the National Institute of Health, Francis Collins, published &quot;The Language of God&quot;. He stated that faith and science are compatible and suggested the word &quot;BioLogos&quot; (Word of Life) to describe theistic evolution. Collins later laid out the idea that God created all things, but that evolution is the best scientific explanation for the diversity of all life on Earth. The name BioLogos instead became the name of the organization Collins founded years later. This organization now prefers the term &quot;evolutionary creation&quot; to describe their take on theistic evolution.

==Historical development==
Historians of science (and authors of pre-evolutionary ideas) have pointed out that scientists had considered the concept of biological change well before Darwin.

In the 17th century, the English Nonconformist/Anglican priest and botanist John Ray, in his book &quot;The Wisdom of God Manifested in the Works of Creation (1692)&quot;, had wondered &quot;why such different species should not only mingle together, but also generate an animal, and yet that that hybridous production should not again generate, and so a new race be carried on&quot;.

18th-century scientist Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778) published &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; (1735), a book in which he considered that new varieties of plants could arise through hybridization, but only under certain limits fixed by God. Linnaeus had initially embraced the Aristotelian idea of immutability of species (the idea that species never change), but later in his life he started to challenge it. Yet, as a Christian, he still defended &quot;special creation&quot;, the belief that God created &quot;every living creature&quot; at the beginning, as read in Genesis, with the peculiarity a set of original species of which all the present species have descended.

Linnaeus wrote:
Linnaeus attributed the active process of biological change to God himself, as he stated:

Jens Christian Clausen (1967), refers to Linnaeus&#x27; theory as a &quot;forgotten evolutionary theory [that] antedates Darwin&#x27;s by nearly 100 years&quot;, and reports that he was a pioneer in doing experiments about hybridization.

Later observations by Protestant botanists Carl Friedrich von Gärtner (1772–1850) and Joseph Gottlieb Kölreuter (1733–1806) denied the immutability of species, which the Bible never teaches. Kölreuter used the term &quot;transmutation of species&quot; to refer to species which have experienced biological changes through hybridization, although they both were inclined to believe that hybrids would revert to the parental forms by a general law of reversion, and therefore, would not be responsible for the introduction of new species. Later, in a number of experiments carried out between 1856 and 1863, the Augustinian friar Gregor Mendel (1822–1884), aligning himself with the &quot;new doctrine of special creation&quot; proposed by Linnaeus, concluded that new species of plants could indeed arise, although limitedly and retaining their own stability.

Georges Cuvier&#x27;s analysis of fossils and discovery of extinction disrupted static views of nature in the early 19th century, confirming geology as showing a historical sequence of life. British natural theology, which sought examples of adaptation to show design by a benevolent Creator, adopted catastrophism to show earlier organisms being replaced in a series of creations by new organisms better adapted to a changed environment. Charles Lyell (1797–1875) also saw adaptation to changing environments as a sign of a benevolent Creator, but his uniformitarianism envisaged continuing extinctions, leaving unanswered the problem of providing replacements. As seen in correspondence between Lyell and John Herschel, scientists were looking for creation by laws rather than by miraculous interventions. In continental Europe, the idealism of philosophers including Lorenz Oken (1779–1851) developed a &quot;Naturphilosophie&quot; in which patterns of development from archetypes were a purposeful divine plan aimed at forming humanity. These scientists rejected transmutation of species as materialist radicalism threatening the established hierarchies of society. The idealist Louis Agassiz (1807–1873), a persistent opponent of transmutation, saw mankind as the goal of a sequence of creations, but his concepts were the first to be adapted into a scheme of theistic evolutionism, when in &quot;Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation&quot; published in 1844, its anonymous author (Robert Chambers) set out goal-centred progressive development as the Creator&#x27;s divine plan, programmed to unfold without direct intervention or miracles. The book became a best-seller and popularised the idea of transmutation in a designed &quot;law of progression&quot;. The scientific establishment strongly attacked &quot;Vestiges&quot; at the time, but later more sophisticated theistic evolutionists followed the same approach of looking for patterns of development as evidence of design.

The comparative anatomist Richard Owen (1804–1892), a prominent figure in the Victorian era scientific establishment, opposed transmutation throughout his life. When formulating homology he adapted idealist philosophy to reconcile natural theology with development, unifying nature as divergence from an underlying form in a process demonstrating design. His conclusion to his &quot;On the Nature of Limbs&quot; of 1849 suggested that divine laws could have controlled the development of life, but he did not expand this idea after objections from his conservative patrons. Others supported the idea of development by law, including the botanist Hewett Watson (1804–1881) and the Reverend Baden Powell (1796–1860), who wrote in 1855 that such laws better illustrated the powers of the Creator. In 1858 Owen in his speech as President of the British Association said that in &quot;continuous operation of Creative power&quot; through geological time, new species of animals appeared in a &quot;successive and continuous fashion&quot; through birth from their antecedents by a Creative law rather than through slow transmutation.

===&quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;===

When Charles Darwin published &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; in 1859, many liberal Christians accepted evolution provided they could reconcile it with divine design. The clergymen Charles Kingsley (1819–1875) and Frederick Temple (1821–1902), both conservative Christians in the Church of England, promoted a theology of creation as an indirect process controlled by divine laws. Some strict Calvinists welcomed the idea of natural selection, as it did not entail inevitable progress and humanity could be seen as a fallen race requiring salvation. The Anglo-Catholic Aubrey Moore (1848–1890) also accepted the theory of natural selection, incorporating it into his Christian beliefs as merely the way God worked. Darwin&#x27;s friend Asa Gray (1810–1888) defended natural selection as compatible with design.

Darwin himself, in his second edition of the &quot;Origin&quot; (January 1860), had written in the conclusion:
Within a decade most scientists had started espousing evolution, but from the outset some expressed opposition to the concept of natural selection and searched for a more purposeful mechanism. In 1860 Richard Owen attacked Darwin&#x27;s &quot;Origin of Species&quot; in an anonymous review while praising &quot;Professor Owen&quot; for &quot;the establishment of the axiom of &quot;the continuous operation of the ordained becoming of living things&quot;&quot;. In December 1859 Darwin had been disappointed to hear that Sir John Herschel apparently dismissed the book as &quot;the law of higgledy-pigglety&quot;, and in 1861 Herschel wrote of evolution that &quot;[a]n intelligence, guided by a purpose, must be continually in action to bias the direction of the steps of change—to regulate their amount—to limit their divergence—and to continue them in a definite course&quot;. He added &quot;On the other hand, we do not mean to deny that such intelligence may act according to law (that is to say, on a preconceived and definite plan)&quot;. The scientist Sir David Brewster (1781–1868), a member of the Free Church of Scotland, wrote an article called &quot;&quot; (1862) in which he rejected many Darwinian ideas, such as those concerning vestigial organs or questioning God&#x27;s perfection in his work. Brewster concluded that Darwin&#x27;s book contained both &quot;much valuable knowledge and much wild speculation&quot;, although accepting that &quot;every part of the human frame had been fashioned by the Divine hand and exhibited the most marvellous and beneficent adaptions for the use of men&quot;.

In the 1860s theistic evolutionism became a popular compromise in science and gained widespread support from the general public. Between 1866 and 1868 Owen published a theory of derivation, proposing that species had an innate tendency to change in ways that resulted in variety and beauty showing creative purpose. Both Owen and Mivart (1827–1900) insisted that natural selection could not explain patterns and variation, which they saw as resulting from divine purpose. In 1867 the Duke of Argyll published &quot;The Reign of Law&quot;, which explained beauty in plumage without any adaptive benefit as design generated by the Creator&#x27;s laws of nature for the delight of humans. Argyll attempted to reconcile evolution with design by suggesting that the laws of variation prepared rudimentary organs for a future need.

Cardinal John Henry Newman wrote in 1868: &quot;Mr Darwin&#x27;s theory need not then to be atheistical, be it true or not; it may simply be suggesting a larger idea of Divine Prescience and Skill ... and I do not [see] that &#x27;the accidental evolution of organic beings&#x27; is inconsistent with divine design—It is accidental to us, not to God.&quot;

In 1871 Darwin published his own research on human ancestry in &quot;The Descent of Man&quot;, concluding that humans &quot;descended from a hairy quadruped, furnished with a tail and pointed ears&quot;, which would be classified amongst the Quadrumana along with monkeys, and in turn descended &quot;through a long line of diversified forms&quot; going back to something like the larvae of sea squirts. Critics promptly complained that this &quot;degrading&quot; image &quot;tears the crown from our heads&quot;, but there is little evidence that it led to loss of faith. Among the few who did record the impact of Darwin&#x27;s writings, the naturalist Joseph LeConte struggled with &quot;distress and doubt&quot; following the death of his daughter in 1861, before enthusiastically saying in the late 1870s there was &quot;not a single philosophical question connected with our highest and dearest religious and spiritual interests that is fundamentally affected, or even put in any new light, by the theory of evolution&quot;, and in the late 1880s embracing the view that &quot;evolution is entirely consistent with a rational theism&quot;. Similarly, George Frederick Wright (1838–1921) responded to Darwin&#x27;s &quot;Origin of Species&quot; and Charles Lyell&#x27;s 1863 &quot;Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man&quot; by turning to Asa Gray&#x27;s belief that God had set the rules at the start and only intervened on rare occasions, as a way to harmonise evolution with theology. The idea of evolution did not seriously shake Wright&#x27;s faith, but he later suffered a crisis when confronted with historical criticism of the Bible.

==Acceptance==

According to Eugenie Scott: &quot;In one form or another, Theistic Evolutionism is the view of creation taught at the majority of mainline Protestant seminaries, and despite the Catholic Church having no official position, it does support belief in it. Studies show that acceptance of evolution is lower in the United States than in Europe or Japan; among 34 countries sampled, only Turkey had a lower rate of acceptance than the United States.

Theistic evolution has been described as arguing for compatibility between science and religion, and as such it is viewed with disdain both by some atheists and many young Earth creationists.

==Hominization==
, in both science and religion, involves the process or the purpose of becoming human. The process and means by which hominization occurs is a key problem in theistic evolutionary thought. This is noticeable more so in Abrahamic religions, which often have held as a core belief that the souls of animals and humans differ in some capacity. Thomas Aquinas taught animals did not have immortal souls, but that humans did. Many versions of theistic evolution insist on a special creation consisting of at least the addition of a soul just for the human species.

Scientific accounts of the origin of the universe, the origin of life, and subsequent evolution of pre-human life forms may not cause any difficulty but the need to reconcile religious and scientific views of hominization and to account for the addition of a soul to humans remains a problem. Theistic evolution typically postulates a point at which a population of hominids who had (or may have) evolved by a process of natural evolution acquired souls and thus (with their descendants) became fully human in theological terms. This group might be restricted to Adam and Eve, or indeed to Mitochondrial Eve, although versions of the theory allow for larger populations. The point at which such an event occurred should essentially be the same as in paleoanthropology and archeology, but theological discussion of the matter tends to concentrate on the theoretical. The term &quot;special transformism&quot; is sometimes used to refer to theories that there was a divine intervention of some sort, achieving hominization.

Several 19th-century theologians and evolutionists attempted specific solutions, including the Catholics John Augustine Zahm and St. George Jackson Mivart, but tended to come under attack from both the theological and biological camps. and 20th-century thinking tended to avoid proposing precise mechanisms.

== Islamic views ==
=== Theological views and stances ===
The Islamic scholar, science lecturer and theologian Shoaib Ahmed Malik divides Muslim positions on the evolution theory into four different views.

# Non-evolutionism: The rejection of evolutionary theory and all of its elements, including common ancestry, macro-evolution, etc. many of its proponents, however, still accept micro-evolution.
# Human exceptionalism: The acceptance of the entirety of evolutionary theory except for human evolution. More specifically, it rejects the idea that modern humans share common ancestry with other life-forms on Earth. It may still accept that humans evolved over time after Adam&#x27;s creation and that various species of humans evolved over time.
# Adamic exceptionalism: The acceptance of evolution, only making an exception for Adam and Hawa (Eve). It asserts that Adam was the first &quot;theologically accurate&quot; human. However, &quot;taxonomically accurate&quot; humans or &quot;human-like&quot; beings already existed on Earth before their arrival. Thus, it accepts the belief that modern humans share common ancestry with other life-forms on Earth, and that our lineage can be traced back to the origin of life.
# Non-exceptionalism: The acceptance of evolution without any exceptions for miraculous creation.

Adamic exceptionalism is the current leading view, as it is considered to be compatible with both science and Islamic theology. Adamic exceptionalism asserts that Adam and Eve were created by Allah through miracles as the first humans, and that the rest of humanity descends from them. At the same time, this view asserts that modern humans emerged through evolution and that modern humans have a lineage leading up to the origin of life (FUCA), and that evolution occurred just as theorized (e.g. &quot;Austalopithecus afarensis&quot; to &quot;Homo habilis&quot;, &quot;H. habilis&quot; to &quot;H. eragaster&quot;, &quot;H. eragaster&quot; to &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot;, &quot;H. heidelbergensis&quot; to &quot;H. sapiens&quot;, etc.) Adamic exceptionalists believe that Allah created &quot;human-like&quot; beings on Earth through evolution before Adam was brought into the world; however, these &quot;human-like&quot; beings do not fit the theological description of &quot;humans&quot;. From a theological perspective, they&#x27;re not true humans, but they are biologically human, since they fit the &quot;taxonomical&quot; description for it. Adam is still considered to be the first human from a theological perspective. Adamic exceptionalism also asserts that the early descendants of Adam mated or hybridized with these &quot;human-like beings&quot;, yielding one lineage that leads to Adam and another that leads to FUCA. This belief is considered to be the most viable because it synthesizes the miraculous creation of Adam and Eve and agrees with Muslim theology. At the same time, it is considered as compatible with evolutionary science—any questions regarding Adam and his miraculous creation, the lineage that leads to him, or whether this lineage mated with other &quot;human-like&quot; beings are irrelevant to science and are not obstacles to any established scientific theories.

David Solomon Jalajel, an Islamic author, proclaims an Adamic exceptionalism view of evolution which encourages the theological use of &quot;tawaqquf&quot;; a &quot;tawaqquf&quot; is to make no argument for or against a matter to which scripture possesses no declarations for. With &quot;tawaqquf&quot;, Jalajel believes that Adam&#x27;s creation does not necessarily signal the beginning of humanity as the Quran makes no declaration as to whether or not human beings were on Earth before Adam had descended. As a result, Jalajel invokes &quot;tawaqquf&quot; which insinuates that it is possible for humans to exist or not exist before the appearance of Adam on earth with either belief being possible due to the Quran, and that it is possible that an intermingling of Adam&#x27;s descendants and other humans may or may not have occurred. Thus, the existence of Adam is a miracle since the Quran directly states it to be, but it does not assert there being no humans who could have existed at the time of Adam&#x27;s appearance on earth and who could have come about as a result of evolution. This viewpoint stands in contrast to creationism and human exceptionalism, ultimately declaring that evolution could be viewed without conflict with Islam and that Muslims could either accept or reject &quot;human evolution on its scientific merits without reference to the story of Adam&quot;.

&quot;Human exceptionalism&quot; is theologically compatible, but has some issues with science due to the rejection of common ancestry of modern humans. &quot;Non-exceptionalism&quot; is scientifically compatible, but it&#x27;s theological validity is a matter of debate.

Proponents of human-exceptionalism include: Yasir Qadhi, Nuh Ha Mim Keller, etc. Proponents of Adamic-exceptionalism include David Solomon Jalajel. Proponents of non-exceptionalism include: Rana Dajani, Nidhal Guessoum, Israr Ahmed, Caner Taslaman, etc.

=== Acceptance ===

The theory of evolution is controversial in plenty of contemporary Muslim societies due to negative social views and misconceptions such as &quot;the theory is atheistic&quot; and lack of understanding about views such as human exceptionalism and Adamic exceptionalism. A lot of people suggest that it also has a lot to do with lack of proper scientific facilities and development in a lot (but not all) Muslim countries, particularly where there exists a lot of conflict and political tension. Regardless, a large majority of Muslims accept evolution in Kazakhstan (79%) and Lebanon (78%). However relatively few in Afghanistan (26%) and Iraq (27%) believe in human evolution. Most other Muslim countries have statistics in between. Belief in theistic evolution is increasing in a lot of Muslim countries and societies. The younger generations have a higher rate of acceptance. Countries more developed or developing faster also have higher rates of acceptance. Muslim societies in non-Muslim countries (such as in the West) are inconsistent and can be high or low depending on the specific countries.

==Relationship to other positions==

===19th-century &#x27;theistic evolution&#x27;===
The American botanist Asa Gray used the name &quot;theistic evolution&quot; in a now-obsolete sense for his point of view, presented in his 1876 book &quot;Essays and Reviews Pertaining to Darwinism&quot;. He argued that the deity supplies beneficial mutations to guide evolution. St George Jackson Mivart argued instead in his 1871 &quot;On the Genesis of Species&quot; that the deity, equipped with foreknowledge, sets the direction of evolution (orthogenesis) by specifying the laws that govern it, and leaves species to evolve according to the conditions they experience as time goes by. The Duke of Argyll set out similar views in his 1867 book &quot;The Reign of Law&quot;. The historian Edward J. Larson stated that the theory failed as an explanation in the minds of biologists from the late 19th century onwards as it broke the rules of methodological naturalism which they had grown to expect.

===Non-theistic evolution===
The major criticism of theistic evolution by non-theistic evolutionists focuses on its essential belief in a supernatural creator. Physicist Lawrence Krauss considers that, by the application of Occam&#x27;s razor, sufficient explanation of the phenomena of evolution is provided by &quot;natural&quot; processes (in particular, natural selection), and the intervention or direction of a &quot;super&quot;natural entity is not required. Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins considers theistic evolution a &quot;superfluous attempt&quot; to &quot;smuggle God in by the back door&quot;.

===Intelligent design===

A number of notable proponents of theistic evolution, including Kenneth R. Miller, John Haught, George Coyne, Simon Conway Morris, Denis Alexander, Ard Louis, Darrel Falk, Alister McGrath, Francisco J. Ayala, and Francis Collins are critics of intelligent design.

===Young Earth creationism===
Young Earth creationists including Ken Ham prefer to criticize theistic evolution on theological grounds rather than on any scientific data, finding it hard to reconcile the nature of a loving God with the process of evolution, in particular, the existence of death and suffering before the Fall of Man. They consider that it undermines central biblical teachings by regarding the creation account as a myth, a parable, or an allegory, instead of treating it as an accurate record of historical events. They also fear that a capitulation to what they call &quot;atheistic&quot; naturalism will confine God to the gaps in scientific explanations, undermining biblical doctrines, such as God&#x27;s incarnation through Christ.

<text>White Plains is an unincorporated community in Charles County, Maryland, in the United States, just south of Waldorf. It is at latitude 38°35&#x27;25&quot; N, longitude 76°56&#x27;26&quot; W. The United States Postal Service has assigned White Plains the ZIP Code 20695. The commercial portion of White Plains lies along U.S. Route 301. The area is experiencing population sprawl from the adjacent unincorporated communities of Waldorf and St. Charles and features new office parks and a scenic new rail trail. The Charles County Department of Health is headquartered in White Plains, and a public golf course is also there. Plans to complete an east–west connector road in the area were mired in controversy because of alleged adverse effects on the environment.

The historic home Spye Park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.

<text>Ellinikon International Airport , sometimes spelled &quot;Hellinikon&quot;, was an international airport that served Athens, Greece, for 63 years. Following its closure on 28 March 2001, it was replaced in service by the new Athens International Airport &quot;Eleftherios Venizelos&quot;. The airport was located south of Athens, and just west of Glyfada. It was named after the village of Elliniko, now a suburb of Athens. The airport had an official capacity of 11 million passengers per year, but served 13.5 million passengers during its last year of operations. A large portion of the site was converted into a stadium and sports facilities for the 2004 Olympic Games.

The former airport is now the site of a major development for coastal Athens, which came under criticism because well-preserved historic buildings (from the 1930s) were demolished. In 2020, construction began on the Hellenikon Metropolitan Park, a complex consisting of luxury homes, hotels, a casino, the Inspire Athens tower, a marina, shops, and offices; it is estimated to be completed by 2025.

The airport site is bordered by beaches to the west, by the Glyfada Golf Club to the south, by the Elliniko-Glyfada municipal boundary, and by a residential area. The Athens radar center is still based at Elliniko.

==History==

Built in 1938, Ellinikon International Airport was originally called Kalamaki Airfield. Following the German invasion of Greece in 1941, Kalamaki Airfield was used as a Luftwaffe air base during the occupation. After World War II, the Greek government allowed the United States to use the airport from 1945 until 1993. Known as Hassani Airport in 1945, it was used by the United States Army Air Forces (USAF) as early as 1 October 1945 as a base of operations for Air Transport Command flights between Rome, Italy, and points in the Middle East. By agreement with Greece, the USAF operated out of the airport for over four decades. In 1988, in one of the first projects for the eventual bid for the 1996 Summer Olympics, the Greek government decided not to renew the agreement, as technical and security issues prevented the airport&#x27;s modernization and expansion. Additionally, it was considered one of the most difficult and risky airports in the world for take-offs and landings because of the natural characteristics of the region (a short and small runway on a narrow strip of flat land between the Aegean Sea and the mountains surrounding the Attiki basin, particularly Mt. Hymmetus. After the non-renewal of the agreement, a series of feasibility studies began on the possibility of a deactivation of the airport and the construction of a new one. Three years after the withdrawal of the agreement, the USAF concluded its operations after the end of the Gulf War.

The airport was the base of operations for the Greek national carrier Olympic Airways. The airport had two terminals: the West Terminal for Olympic Airways, and the East Terminal for all other carriers. The East Terminal building was designed between 1960 and 1969 by Finnish architect Eero Saarinen. Just before its closure in 2001, the airport recorded a 15.6% growth rate over its previous year, serving 13.5 million passengers per year and handling 57 airlines flying to 87 destinations. The airport&#x27;s official capacity was 11 million passengers per year.

The airport was closed on 28 March 2001. The last aircraft to depart from Ellinikon was an Olympic Airways Boeing 737 bound for Thessaloníki. All flights were transferred to the new Athens International Airport, located 20 km east of the city in Spata.

==Redevelopment==
A large part of the airport is still derelict, and old aircraft and airport vehicles can still be seen on the site. The site has been used as a camp for immigrants and refugees. The Civil Aviation Museum operated out of the West Terminal from April 2011 until 2018. The Olympic Airways Employees’ Cultural Center (POLKEOA) hopes to reopen a museum showcasing its collection of Olympic Airways memorabilia and aircraft.

===2004 Olympic Summer Games===

After its closure, the northwest portion of the airport was redeveloped, converting aprons into a provisory Olympic complex that housed the 2004 Summer Olympics venues for canoe and kayak slalom, field hockey, baseball, and softball. Other Olympics-related upgrades to the airport included transforming one of the western hangars into the secondary arena for the basketball tournament and the fencing competition. During the 2004 Summer Paralympics, the arena hosted wheelchair fencing and sitting volleyball matches. The archery events, blind football, and CP football were held at the hockey and softball fields.

===Hellenikon Metropolitan Park===

In 2005, a team led by architects David Serero, Elena Fernandez, and landscape architect Philippe Coignet won a competition against over 300 teams of architects to design a metropolitan park on the former site of the Ellinikon Airport. The competition was sponsored by UIA (International Union of Architects), the Greek Ministry of Environment, and the Organization for the Planning and Environmental Protection of Athens (ORSA). The project was further developed in 2006 and 2007 by this team through two development phases with the planning organizations of Athens. By 2012, government plans to attract investors and develop the site commercially were eclipsing the proposed park, though nearby communities remained vocal about their preference for a park. There was also another plan to turn the airport into a coastal resort. 

==Accidents and incidents==
The following is a list of aircraft accidents and incidents that occurred at or in the vicinity of Ellinikon airport. Only deadly occurrences or hull-losses are listed.

*21 June 1959 – Following a tire burst upon landing, a fire erupted when debris ruptured the fuel lines of a Royal Canadian Air Force Canadair North Star (registration 17525) that was returning to Canada.
*2 August 1961 – SAA Boeing 707-344 ZS-CKE scraped a wall and hit a tree during takeoff. After arriving in Nairobi, it was discovered substantial damage was present. The plane was repaired.
*26 December 1968 – Two terrorists opened fire and threw grenades at El Al Flight 253, killing one passenger.
*8 December 1969 – Olympic Airways Flight 954, a Douglas DC-6 (tail number SX-DAE), crashed into Mount Paneio while on approach to the airport. All 90 passengers and crew on board were killed, making the accident the worst aviation disaster involving a DC-6.
*21 October 1972 – An Olympic Airways NAMC YS-11A-500 (tail number SX-BBQ) that was operating a domestic scheduled Kerkyra–Athens passenger service crashed into the sea on approach to the airport in poor visibility. There were 53 people aboard, of whom 36 passengers and the co-pilot drowned, while 13 passengers and the remaining three crew members were rescued.
*22 January 1973 – A Piaggio P.136L-2 amphibious plane (tail number SX-BDC) crashed shortly after takeoff from runway 33. The crash occurred as a result of the reversing of the aileron connecting cables during the installation of a new control column on the plane. Alexander Onassis, one of the aircraft&#x27;s three passengers, died as a result of injuries sustained in the accident.
*5 August 1973 – The 1973 Athens Hellinikon International Airport attack, in which two Palestinian militants claiming affiliation with the Black September Organization opened fire on a passenger lounge, killing three and wounding 55.
*17 December 1973 – Stopover of hijacked Lufthansa Flight 303, a flight from Italy to Kuwait.
*3 December 1975 – TMA Boeing 747-123F OD-AGC landed on runway 15 with just 5,000 feet of pavement remaining and applied thrust reversers late, causing the plane to go off the end of the runway and onto a public road. All 7 onboard survived and the plane was repaired.
*9 August 1978 – Olympic Airways Flight 411, a Boeing 747, experienced an engine failure on takeoff but returned safely without passenger or crew injuries.
*8 October 1979 – Swissair Flight 316, a Douglas DC-8-62 (registration HB-IDE), overran the runway on landing, inbound from Geneva. Both the port wing and the tail separated from the fuselage before the aircraft came to rest. A fire that broke out killed 14 of the 154 people on board.
*14 June 1985 – TWA Flight 847 was hijacked shortly after takeoff from Athens, and the passengers were held hostage for three days. One was murdered.
*24 March 1992 – A Golden Star Air Cargo Boeing 707-320C (tail number ST-ALX) that was operating an Amsterdam-Athens cargo service, struck Mount Hymettus, southeast of the airport, on a visual approach. There were seven reported fatalities.

==Climate==
Elliniko has a hot semi-arid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;), closely bordering a Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;) with hot, dry summers and cool, rainy winters.

==In popular culture==
Ellinikon had been featured in several movie productions:
* A sequence of the 1986 Menahem Golan movie &quot;The Delta Force&quot; where one of the Lebanese terrorists exits a taxi was shot at Ellinikon&#x27;s eastern terminal. The Athens airport interiors, however, were filmed in Terminal 1 of Ben Gurion Airport in Israel.
* The 2015 Christoforos Papakaliatis movie &quot;Worlds Apart&quot; used the East Terminal building and apron as a camp for refugees, as well as the exterior and interior of the abandoned Boeing 747-200 parked there.
*In 2018, the music video for &quot;Tomame&quot; by Greek pop star Eleni Foureira was partially filmed in the airport.
*The sci-fi short film &quot;Third Kind&quot; by Yorgos Zois is set in the airport, in the aftermath of the refugee crisis, where the belongings of the refugees are the props of the movie.
*In 2019, a challenge for the 2020 season of the Belgian reality TV show &quot;De Mol&quot; was filmed on the runway and apron.

<doc id="328835" wikidata="Q305880" url="?curid=328835" title="Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park">
<text>Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park is a national park of the United States located in western Colorado and managed by the National Park Service. The Black Canyon of the Gunnison was established as a national monument on March 2, 1933. It was redesignated a national park on October 21, 1999, and incorporated 4,000 acres owned by the Bureau of Land Management. The Gunnison Gorge National Conservation Area was created at the same time. There are two primary entrances to the park: the south rim entrance is located east of Montrose, while the north rim entrance is south of Crawford and is closed in the winter. The park contains of the Gunnison River. The national park itself contains the deepest and most dramatic section of the canyon, but the canyon continues upstream into Curecanti National Recreation Area and downstream into Gunnison Gorge National Conservation Area. The canyon&#x27;s name owes itself to the fact that parts of the gorge only receive 33 minutes of sunlight a day, according to &quot;Images of America: The Black Canyon of the Gunnison&quot;. In the book, author Duane Vandenbusche states, &quot;Several canyons of the American West are longer and some are deeper, but none combines the depth, sheerness, narrowness, darkness, and dread of the Black Canyon.&quot;

== Geology ==

The Gunnison River drops an average of through the entire canyon, making it the 5th steepest mountain descent in North America. By comparison, the Colorado River drops an average of through the Grand Canyon. The greatest descent of the Gunnison River occurs within the park at Chasm View dropping . The Black Canyon is so named because its steepness makes it difficult for sunlight to penetrate into its depths. As a result, the canyon is often shrouded in shadow, causing the rocky walls to appear black. At its narrowest point the canyon is only wide at the river.
The extreme steepness and depth of the Black Canyon formed as the result of several geologic processes acting together. The Gunnison River is primarily responsible for carving the canyon, though several other geologic events had to occur in order to form the canyon as it is seen today.

===Precambrian===
The Precambrian gneiss and schist that make up the majority of the steep walls of the Black Canyon formed 1.7 billion years ago during a metamorphic period brought on by the collision of ancient volcanic island arcs with the southern end of what is present-day Wyoming. The lighter-colored pegmatite dikes that can be seen crosscutting the basement rocks formed later during this same period.

===Cretaceous - Tertiary===
The entire area underwent uplift during the Laramide orogeny between 70 and 40 million years ago which was also part of the Gunnison Uplift. This raised the Precambrian gneiss and schist that makes up the canyon walls. During the Tertiary from 26 to 35 million years ago large episodes of volcanism occurred in the area immediately surrounding the present day Black Canyon. The West Elk Mountains, La Sal Mountains, Henry Mountains, and Abajo Mountains all contributed to burying the area in several thousand feet of volcanic ash and debris.

The modern Gunnison River set its course 15 million years ago as the run-off from the nearby La Sal and West Elk Mountains and the Sawatch Range began carving through the relatively soft volcanic deposits.

===Quaternary===
With the Gunnison River&#x27;s course set, a broad uplift in the area 2 to 3 million years ago caused the river to cut through the softer volcanic deposits. Eventually the river reached the Precambrian rocks of the Gunnison Uplift. Since the river was unable to change its course, it began scouring through the extremely hard metamorphic rocks of the Gunnison Uplift. The river&#x27;s flow was much larger than currently, with much higher levels of turbidity. As a result, the river dug down through the Precambrian gneiss and schist at the rate of every 100 years. The extreme hardness of the metamorphic rock along with the relative quickness with which the river carved through them created the steep walls that can be seen today.

A number of feeder canyons running into the Black Canyon slope in the wrong direction for water to flow into the canyon. It is believed that less-entrenched streams in the region shifted to a more north-flowing drainage pattern in response to a change in the tilt of the surrounding terrain. The west-flowing Gunnison, however, was essentially trapped in the hard Precambrian rock of the Black Canyon and could not change its course.

== History ==
The Ute had known the canyon to exist for a long time before the first Europeans saw it. They referred to the river as &quot;much rocks, big water&quot;, and are known to have avoided the canyon out of superstition. By the time the United States declared independence in 1776, two Spanish expeditions had passed by the canyons. In the 1800s, the numerous fur trappers searching for beaver pelts would have known of the canyon&#x27;s existence but they left no written record. The first official account of the Black Canyon was provided by Captain John Williams Gunnison in 1853, who was leading an expedition to survey a route from Saint Louis and San Francisco. He described the country to be &quot;the roughest, most hilly and most cut up&quot; he had ever seen, and skirted the canyon south towards present-day Montrose. Following his death at the hands of the Ute later that year, the river that Captain Gunnison had called the Grand was renamed in his honor.

=== The Denver &amp; Rio Grande ===
In 1881, William Jackson Palmer&#x27;s Denver and Rio Grande Railroad had reached Gunnison from Denver. The line was built to provide a link to the burgeoning gold and silver mines of the San Juan mountains. The rugged terrain precluded using standard rail; Palmer decided to go with the narrower gauge. It took over a year for Irish and Italian laborers to carve out a roadbed from Sapinero to Cimarron, costing a staggering $165,000 per mile. The last mile is said to have cost more than the entire Royal Gorge project.

On August 13, 1882, the first passenger train passed through the Black Canyon. The editor of the Gunnison Review-Press rode in one of the observation cars; he remarked that the canyon was undoubtedly the largest and most rugged canyon in the world traversed by the iron horse. We had often heard of the scenery of this canyon, but no one can have the faintest conception of its grandeur and magnificence until they have made a trip through it. It is a narrow gorge with walls of granite rising in some places to a height of thousands of feet... Throughout its entire length there is probably not a quarter of a mile of straight track on it. It is a serpentine road in every respect and the curves are frequent and sharp. In hundreds of places the walls of granite are perpendicular and in many places the road bed is blasted out in the side of the walls of rock which overhang the track. He went on to proclaim, &quot;Another such a feat of railroad engineering probably can not be found in the world, and there is probably no section of Colorado or of the whole country where such a varied and interesting lot of scenery can be found.&quot;

In the hopes of running the railroad through the rest of the Black Canyon, Palmer sent his top engineer Bryan Bryant on an inner canyon exploration. Bryant set off with a 12-man crew in December 1882 expecting to complete the survey in 20 days; he returned in 68. &quot;Eight of the twelve-man crew left after a few days, terrified of the task in front of them. What the rest of the men saw was spectacular and had never been seen by another human.&quot; Bryant reported that the Black Canyon was impenetrable, and that it was impossible to build anything in its depths.

Heeding Bryant&#x27;s advice, Palmer decided to route the railroad south of the canyon and in March 1883, it completed its connection to Salt Lake City and for a brief period the canyon was on the main line of a transcontinental railroad system. While the railroad and early visitors used the canyon as a path to Utah and mines to the southwest, later visitors came to see the canyon as an opportunity for recreation and personal enjoyment.
Rudyard Kipling described his 1889 ride through the canyon in the following words: We entered a gorge, remote from the sun, where the rocks were two thousand feet sheer, and where a rock splintered river roared and howled ten feet below a track which seemed to have been built on the simple principle of dropping miscellaneous dirt into the river and pinning a few rails a-top. There was a glory and a wonder and a mystery about the mad ride...

By 1890, an alternate route through Glenwood Springs had been completed and the route through the Black Canyon, being more difficult to operate, lost importance for through trains. However, local rail traffic continued over the &quot;Black Canyon Line&quot; until the route was finally abandoned in the early 1950s. Today, various elements of the railroad have been preserved in the Cimarron area including a steel bridge in Cimarron Canyon.

=== The Gunnison Tunnel ===
In 1901, the U.S. Geological Survey sent Abraham Lincoln Fellows and William Torrence into the canyon to look for a site to build a diversion tunnel bringing water to the Uncompahgre Valley, which was suffering from water shortages due to an influx of settlers into the area. Torrence, a Montrose native and an expert mountaineer, joined four other men in a failed expedition to explore the canyon in September 1900 using two wooden boats. His experience proved invaluable on the second attempt in August 1901. Torrence and Fellows opted to bring a small specially made multi-chambered rubber raft with a lifeline all the way around it instead of the wooden boats that had doomed the previous journey. The two men entered the canyon on August 12 equipped with &quot;hunting knives, two silk lifeline ropes, and rubber bags to encase their instruments.&quot; Torrence and Fellows each had backpacks weighing 35 pounds and the rubber raft turned out to be a great way to float their gear on the narrow river. After 10 days of climbing over rock falls, descending waterfalls, and swimming over 70 sections of the river, they emerged from their 30 mile run with a first recorded descent as well as a suitable tunnel site.

Construction on the tunnel began 4 years later, and was fraught with difficulties right from the onset. Working conditions at the tunnel were difficult due to the high levels of carbon dioxide, excessive temperatures, humidity, water, mud, shale, sand, and a fractured fault zone... It took the tunneling crew almost one year to bore through 2000 feet of water-filled rock. The tunnel was driven through granite, quartzite, gneiss, and shale as well as layers of sandstone, coal, and limestone. Work on the Gunnison Tunnel was first done manually and by candlelight. One miner would hold the drill and rotate it while the second miner would use a sledgehammer to drive the drill into the rock. This work required strong, hard-working men. In spite of good pay and fringe benefits, most disliked the dangerous underground conditions and stayed an average of only 2 weeks. 26 men were killed during the 4 year undertaking. The tunnel was finally completed in 1909, stretching a distance of 5.8 miles and costing nearly 3 million dollars. At the time, the Gunnison Tunnel held the honor of being the world&#x27;s longest irrigation tunnel. On September 23, President William Howard Taft dedicated the tunnel in Montrose. The East Portal of the Gunnison Tunnel is accessible via East Portal Road which is on the South Rim of the canyon. Although the tunnel itself is not visible, the diversion dam can be seen from the campground.

=== Creation of the park ===
The Black Canyon of the Gunnison was established as a national monument on March 2, 1933. It was redesignated a national park on October 21, 1999, and incorporated 4,000 acres owned by the Bureau of Land Management. The Gunnison Gorge National Conservation Area was created at the same time.

During 1933–35, the Civilian Conservation Corps built the North Rim Road to design by the National Park Service. This includes five miles of roadway and five overlooks; it is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places as a historic district.

About half of the park, , was designated a wilderness area in 1976.

The 2,500-acre Sanburg Ranch was added to the park in 2017.

== Biology ==
The Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park contains a wide variety of flora and fauna. Some common plants native to the park include aspen, Ponderosa pine, sagebrush, desert mahogany (&quot;Cercocarpus ledifolius&quot;), Utah juniper, gambel oak (&quot;scrub oak&quot;) and single-leaf ash. The Black Canyon gilia (&quot;Aliciella penstemonoides&quot;) is a species of wildflower native to the park.
Wildlife in this park include the pronghorn, black bear, coyote, muskrat, six species of lizard, cougar, raccoon, beaver, elk, river otter, bobcat, and mule deer. In addition, the canyon is the home of a number of resident birds including the American dipper, two species of eagle, eight species of hawk, six species of owl, and Steller&#x27;s jay as well as migratory birds such as the mountain bluebird, peregrine falcon, magpie, white-throated swift and canyon wren.

==Climate==

According to the Köppen climate classification system, Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park has a warm-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;).

== Attractions ==
An annual average of about 190,000 tourists visited the park in the period from 2007 to 2016. The main attraction of the park is the scenic drive along US Highway 50 and Colorado Highway 92, as well as the south rim. The east end of the park, where it meets Blue Mesa Reservoir at Blue Mesa Point, is the area most developed for camping. It includes tent camping and RV camping with full hookups (private site), as well as canyon tours, hiking, fishing and boat tours. Nearby is the Curecanti National Recreation Area which includes a visitor center, marina facilities and, among 10 campgrounds within the NRA, the Lake Fork Campground. The west end of the park has river access by automobile, as well as guided tours of the canyon. A short hike at Blue Mesa Point Information Center heads down to Pine Creek and the Morrow Point boat tours, boating, fishing and hiking. At the south rim there is one campground for tent and RV camping, one loop of which has electrical hookups, and several hiking and nature trails. The north rim is also accessible by automobile and has a small, primitive campground. Automobiles can access the river via the East Portal Road at the south rim; this road has a 16% grade and is prohibited to vehicles over in length.

The river can also be accessed by steep, unmaintained trails called &quot;routes&quot; or &quot;draws&quot; on the north and south rim. These routes require about two hours to hike down and two to four hours to hike back up, depending on which route is taken. All inner canyon descents are strenuous and require Class 3 climbing and basic route finding skills. Steep talus, impassable ledges, and lack of cover are some of the challenges hikers are faced with. Poison ivy also grows abundantly in the draws and on the canyon floor. Long sleeves and hiking boots are strongly recommended. The flow rate of the Gunnison River should also be considered for those planning on camping in the canyon, as high river levels can wash out the camp sites. The National Park Service warns the following: &quot;Routes are difficult to follow, and only individuals in excellent physical condition should attempt these hikes ... Hikers are expected to find their own way and to be prepared for self-rescue.&quot; A free back country permit is required for all inner canyon use except at the west end.

The Gunnison River is designated as a Gold Medal Water from 200 yards downstream of Crystal Reservoir Dam to the North Fork. This includes the 12 miles within the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park. Only artificial flies and lures are permitted, and all rainbow trout are catch and release. Additionally, fishing is prohibited within 200 yards downstream of Crystal Dam.
The Black Canyon is a center for rock climbing in a style known as traditional climbing. Most of the climbs are difficult and attempted only by advanced climbers.

Rafting opportunities exist in the region, but the run through the park itself is a difficult technical run for only the best kayakers. There are several impassable stretches of water requiring long, sometimes dangerous portages. The remaining rapids are class III - V, and are only for expert river runners. Downstream, in the Gunnison Gorge National Conservation Area, the river is somewhat easier to navigate, though still very remote and only for experienced runners, with rapids that are Class III - IV.

== In popular culture ==

The canyon inspired a 1954 symphonic composition by Frank William Erickson, &quot;Black Canyon of the Gunnison&quot;. Author Ursula K. Le Guin based the site of the eponymous city in her 1967 novel &quot;City of Illusions&quot; on the Black Canyon of Gunnison National Park. In 2017, The Infamous Stringdusters released a song about the trip undertaken by Fellows and Torrence, &quot;1901: A Canyon Odyssey&quot;.

<doc id="328838" wikidata="Q174782" url="?curid=328838" title="Town square">
<text>A town square (or public square, urban square, or simply square), also called a plaza or piazza, is an open public space commonly found in the heart of a traditional town, and which is used for community gatherings. A square in a city may be called a city square. Related concepts are the civic center, the market square and the village green.

Most squares are hardscapes suitable for open markets, concerts, political rallies, and other events that require firm ground. They are not necessarily a true geometric square.

Being centrally located, town squares are usually surrounded by small shops such as bakeries, meat markets, cheese stores, and clothing stores. At their center is often a well, monument, statue or other feature. Those with fountains are sometimes called fountain squares.

The term &quot;town square&quot; (especially via the term &quot;public square&quot;) is synonymous with the politics of many cultures, and the names of a certain town squares, such as the Euromaidan or Red Square, have become symbolic of specific political events throughout history.

==Australia==
The city centre of Adelaide and the adjacent suburb of North Adelaide, in South Australia, were planned by Colonel William Light in 1837. The city streets were laid out in a grid plan, with the city centre including a central public square, Victoria Square, and four public squares in the centre of each quarter of the city. North Adelaide has two public squares. The city was also designed to be surrounded by park lands, and all of these features still exist today, with the squares maintained as mostly green spaces.

==China==

In Mainland China, People&#x27;s Square is a common designation for the central town square of modern Chinese cities, established as part of urban modernization within the last few decades. These squares are the site of government buildings, museums and other public buildings. One such square, Tiananmen Square, is a famous site in Chinese history due to it being the site of the May Fourth Movement, the Proclamation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the 1976 Tiananmen Incident, the 1989 Tiananmen Square Protests, and all Chinese National Day Parades.

==Germany==

The German word for square is , which also means &quot;Place&quot;, and is a common term for central squares in German-speaking countries. These have been focal points of public life in towns and cities from the Middle Ages to today. Squares located opposite a Palace or Castle () are commonly named Schlossplatz. Prominent &quot;Plätze&quot; include the Alexanderplatz, Pariser Platz and Potsdamer Platz in Berlin, Heldenplatz in Vienna, and the Königsplatz in Munich.

==Indonesia==

A large open square common in villages, towns and cities of Indonesia is known as &quot;alun-alun&quot;. It is a Javanese term which in modern-day Indonesia refers to the two large open squares of kraton compounds. It is typically located adjacent a mosque or a palace. It is a place for public spectacles, court celebrations and general non-court entertainments.

==Iran==

In traditional Persian architecture, town squares are known as maydan or meydan. A maydan is considered one of the essential features in urban planning and they are often adjacent to bazaars, large mosques and other public buildings. Naqsh-e Jahan Square in Isfahan and Azadi Square in Tehran are examples of classic and modern squares. Several countries use the term &quot;maidan&quot; across Eastern Europe and Central Asia, including Ukraine, in which the term became well-known globally during the Euromaidan.

==Italy==
A () is a city square in Italy, Malta, along the Dalmatian coast and in surrounding regions. Possibly influenced by the centrality of the Forum (Roman) to ancient Mediterranean culture, the &quot;piazze&quot; of Italy are central to most towns and cities. Shops, businesses, metro stations, and bus stops are commonly found on &quot;piazzas&quot;, and in multiple locations also feature Roman Catholic Churches, such as in places known as the Piazza del Duomo, with the most famous perhaps being at Duomo di Milan, or government buildings, such as the Piazza del Quirinale adjacent from the Quirinal Palace of the Italian president.

The Piazza San Marco in Venice and Piazza del Popolo in Rome are among the world&#x27;s best known. The Italian piazzas historically played a major role in the political developments of Italy in both the Italian Medieval Era and the Italian Renaissance. For example, the Piazza della Signoria in Florence remains synonymous with the return of the Medici from their exile in 1530 as well as the burning at the stake of Savonarola during the Italian Inquisition.

The Italian term is roughly equivalent to the Spanish , French term , Portuguese , and German . Not to be confused, other countries use the phrase to refer to an unrelated feature of architectural or urban design, such as the &quot;piazza&quot; at King&#x27;s Cross station in London or &quot;piazza&quot; as used by some in the United States, to refer to a verandah or front porch of a house or apartment, such as at George Washington&#x27;s historic home Mount Vernon.

Several countries, especially around the Mediterranean Sea, feature Italian-style town squares. In Gibraltar, one such town square just off Gibraltar&#x27;s Main Street, between the Parliament Building and the City Hall officially named &quot;John Mackintosh Square&quot; is referred to as &quot;The Piazza&quot;.

==Netherlands and Belgium==

In the Low Countries, squares are often called &quot;markets&quot; because of their usage as marketplaces. Most towns and cities in Belgium and the southern part of the Netherlands have in their historical centre a (literally &quot;Big Market&quot;) in Dutch or (literally &quot;Grand Square&quot;) in French (for example the Grand-Place in Brussels and the in Antwerp). The or is often the location of the town hall, hence also the political centre of the town. The Dutch word for square is &quot;plein&quot;, which is another common name for squares in Dutch-speaking regions (for example Het Plein in The Hague).

In the 17th and 18th centuries, another type of square emerged, the so-called &quot;royal square&quot; (, ). Such squares did not serve as a marketplace but were built in front of large palaces or public buildings to emphasise their grandeur, as well as to accommodate military parades and ceremonies, among others (for example the Place Royale in Brussels and the Koningsplein in Amsterdam). Palace squares are usually more symmetrical than their older market counterparts.

==Russia==

In Russia, &quot;central square&quot; (, romanised: &quot;tsentráĺnaya plóshchad́&quot;) is a common term for an open area in the heart of the town. In a number of cities, the square has no individual name and is officially designated &quot;Central Square&quot;, for example Central Square (Tolyatti). The most famous central square is the monumentally-proportioned Red Square which became a synecdoche for the Soviet Union during the 20th century; nevertheless, the association with &quot;red communism&quot; is a back formation, since &quot;krásnaja&quot; (the term for &quot;red&quot;) also means &quot;beautiful&quot; in archaic and poetic Russian, with many cities and towns throughout the region having locations with the name &quot;Red Square.&quot;

==South Korea==
Gwanghwamun Plaza (Korean: 광화문광장) also known as Gwanghwamun Square) is a public open space on Sejongno, Jongno-gu, Seoul, South Korea. It against the background of A Gwanghwamun Gate(Korean: 광화문).

In 2009, Restoration of Gwanghwamun Gate made the gate&#x27;s front space as a public plaza. The square has been renovated to modern style has new waterways &amp; rest Areas, exhibition Hall for Excavated Cultural Assets in 2022 Aug.

==Spanish-speaking countries==
The Spanish-language term for a public square is ( or depending on the dialectal variety). It comes from Latin , with the meaning of &#x27;broad street&#x27; or &#x27;public square&#x27;. Ultimately coming from Greek &quot;plateia (hodos)&quot;, it is a cognate of Italian and French (which has also been borrowed into English).

The term is used across Spanish-speaking territories in Spain and the Americas, as well as in the Philippines. In addition to smaller plazas, the (sometimes called in the Americas as &quot;Plaza de Armas&quot;, &quot;armament square&quot; where troops could be mustered) of each center of administration held three closely related institutions: the cathedral, the &quot;cantabile&quot; or administrative center, which might be incorporated in a wing of a governor&#x27;s palace, and the or law court. The plaza might be large enough to serve as a military parade ground. At times of crisis or fiestas, it serves as the gathering space for large crowds.

Diminutives of include and the latter&#x27;s double diminutive , which can be occasionally used as a particle in a proper noun.

Like the Italian and the Portuguese , the plaza remains a center of community life that is only equaled by the market-place. A is a bullring. Shopping centers may incorporate &#x27;plaza&#x27; into their names, and is used in some countries as a synonym for i.e. &quot;shopping center&quot;.

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, and especially in London and Edinburgh, a &quot;square&quot; has a wider meaning. There are public squares of the type described above but the term is also used for formal open spaces surrounded by houses with private gardens at the centre, sometimes known as garden squares. Most of these were built in the 18th and 19th centuries. In some cases the gardens are now open to the public. See the Squares in London category. Additionally, many public squares were created in towns and cities across the UK as part of urban redevelopment following the Blitz. Squares can also be quite small and resemble courtyards, especially in the City of London.

==United States==
In some cities, especially in New England, the term &quot;square&quot; (as its Spanish equivalent, &quot;plaza&quot;) is applied to a commercial area (like Central Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts), usually formed around the intersection of three or more streets, and which originally consisted of some open area (many of which have been filled in with traffic islands and other traffic calming features). Many of these intersections are irregular rather than square.

The &quot;placita&quot; (Spanish for &quot;little plaza&quot;), as it is known in the Southwestern United States, is a common feature within the boundaries of the former provincial kingdom of Santa Fe de Nuevo México. They are a blend of Hispano and Pueblo design styles, several of which continue to be hubs for cities and towns in New Mexico, including Santa Fe Plaza, Old Town Albuquerque, Acoma Pueblo&#x27;s plaza, Taos Downtown Historic District, Mesilla Plaza, Mora, and Las Vegas Plaza.

In U.S. English, a plaza can mean one of several things:
* a town square, as in the Spanish usage
* &quot;any open area usually located near urban buildings and often featuring walkways, trees and shrubs, places to sit, and sometimes shops&quot;
* a shopping center of any size
* a toll plaza, where traffic must temporarily stop to pay tolls
* an area adjacent to an expressway that has service facilities (such as restaurants, gas stations, and restrooms)

Today&#x27;s metropolitan landscapes often incorporate the plaza as a design element, or as an outcome of zoning regulations, building budgetary constraints, and the like. Sociologist William H. Whyte conducted an extensive study of plazas in New York City: his study humanized the way modern urban plazas are conceptualized, and helped usher in significant design changes in the making of plazas. They can be used to open spaces for low-income neighborhoods, and can also the overall aesthetic of the surrounding area boosting economic vitality, pedestrian mobility and safety for pedestrians. Most plazas are created out of a collaboration between local non-profit applicants and city officials which requires approval from the city.

Throughout North America, words like &quot;place&quot;, &quot;square&quot;, or &quot;plaza&quot; frequently appear in the names of commercial developments such as shopping centers and hotels.

<text>This is a list of political parties in Switzerland.

Switzerland has a multi-party system. Since 1959, the four largest parties have formed a coalition government, according to a &quot;&quot; or &quot;magic formula&quot;. This arithmetic formula divides the seven cabinet seats among representatives of the four largest parties.

== Political parties in Switzerland ==

=== Federal and cantonal parliaments ===

The following parties are represented in the Swiss Federal Assembly or cantonal parliaments and executive councils as of 2024. For their names in the four national languages of Switzerland, see #Names in the national languages below.

<text>The vitreous body (&quot;vitreous&quot; meaning &quot;glass-like&quot;; , ) is the clear gel that fills the space between the lens and the retina of the eyeball (the vitreous chamber) in humans and other vertebrates. It is often referred to as the vitreous humor (also spelled humour), from Latin meaning liquid, or simply &quot;the vitreous&quot;. Vitreous fluid or &quot;liquid vitreous&quot; is the liquid component of the vitreous gel, found after a vitreous detachment. It is not to be confused with the aqueous humor, the other fluid in the eye that is found between the cornea and lens.

==Structure==
The vitreous humor is a transparent, colorless, gelatinous mass that fills the space in the eye between the lens and the retina. It is surrounded by a layer of collagen called the vitreous membrane (or hyaloid membrane or vitreous cortex) separating it from the rest of the eye. It makes up four-fifths of the volume of the eyeball. The vitreous humour is fluid-like near the centre, and gel-like near the edges.

The vitreous humour is in contact with the vitreous membrane overlying the retina. Collagen fibrils attach the vitreous at the optic nerve disc and the ora serrata (where the retina ends anteriorly), at the Wieger-band, the dorsal side of the lens. The vitreous also firmly attaches to the lens capsule, retinal vessels, and the macula, the area of the retina which provides finer detail and central vision.

Aquaporin 4 in Müller cells in rats transports water to the vitreous body.

===Anatomical features===
The vitreous has many anatomical landmarks, including the hyaloid membrane, Berger&#x27;s space, space of Erggelet, Wieger&#x27;s ligament, Cloquet&#x27;s canal and the space of Martegiani.

Surface features:
* Patella fossa: Shallow saucer-like concavity anteriorly, in which the lens rests, separated by Berger&#x27;s space
* (Wieger&#x27;s ligament): Circular thickening of vitreous 8–9mm in diameter, delineates the patella fossa
* Anterior hyaloid: Vitreous surface anterior to ora serrata. Continuous with and invests in the zonular fibres, and extends forward between the ciliary processes
* Vitreous base: Denser cortical area of vitreous. Firmly attached to the posterior 2mm of the pars plana, and the anterior 2–4mm of retina
* Posterior hyaloid surface: Closely applied to retinal internal limiting membrane. Firm attachment sites: Along blood vessels and at sites of retinal degeneration
* Space of Martegioni: A funnel shaped space overlying the optic disc with condensed edge
* Cloquet&#x27;s canal: A 1–2 mm wide canal within the vitreous, from the space of Martegioni to the space of Berger, along an S-shaped course mainly below the horizontal. It is labelled &quot;hyaloid canal&quot; in the above diagram.
* Mittendorf&#x27;s dot: A small circular opacity on the posterior lens capsule, which represents the site of attachment of the hyaloid artery before it subsequently regressed.
* Bergmeister&#x27;s papilla: A tuft of fibrous tissue at the optic disc, which represents a remnant of the sheath associated with the hyaloid artery before it subsequently regressed.

Internal structures of the vitreous
* The vitreous body at birth is homogenous with a finely striated pattern.
* With early aging the vitreous develops narrow transvitreal &quot;channels&quot;.
* The cortex is denser than the centre with development.
* From adolescence, vitreous tracts form from anterior to posterior.
* These vitreous tracts are fine sheet-like condensations of vitreous.

Named tracts
* Retrolental tract: Extends posteriorly from the hyaloideocapsular ligament into central vitreous
* Coronary tract: External to the retrolental tract, and excluding posteriorly from a circular zone overlying the posterior 1/3rd of the ciliary processes
* Median tract: Extends back from a circular zone external to the coronary tract, at the anterior margin of the vitreous base
* Preretinal tract: Extends back from the ora serrata and vitreous base

===Biochemical properties===
Its composition is similar to that of the cornea, but the vitreous contains very few cells. It is composed mostly of phagocytes, which remove unwanted cellular debris in the visual field, and hyalocytes, which turn over the hyaluronan.

The vitreous humour contains no blood vessels, and 98–99% of its volume is water. In addition to water, the vitreous consists of salts, sugars, vitrosin (a type of collagen), a network of collagen type II fibrils with glycosaminoglycan, hyaluronan, opticin, and a wide array of proteins. Despite having little solid matter, the fluid is substantial enough to fill the eye and give it its spherical shape. This contrasts with the aqueous humour, which is more fluid, and the lens, on the other hand, which is elastic in nature and is tightly packed with cells. The vitreous humour has a viscosity two to four times that of water, giving it a gelatinous consistency. It has a refractive index of 1.336.





==Development==
The vitreous fluid is not present at birth (the eye being filled with only the gel-like vitreous &quot;body&quot;), but found after age 4-5, and increases in size thereafter.

Produced by cells in the non-pigmented portion of the ciliary body, the vitreous humour is derived from embryonic mesenchyme cells, which degenerate after birth.

The nature and composition of the vitreous humour changes over the course of life. In adolescence, the vitreous cortex becomes more dense and vitreous tracts develop; and in adulthood, the tracts become better defined and sinuous. Central vitreous liquefies, fibrillar degeneration occurs, and the tracts break up (syneresis).

Coarse strands develop with ageing. The gel volume decreases with age, and the liquid volume increases. The cortex may disappear at sites, allowing liquid vitreous to extrude adjacently into the potential space between vitreous cortex and retina (vitreous detachment).

==Clinical significance==
===Injury===
If the vitreous pulls away from the retina, it is known as a vitreous detachment. As the human body ages, the vitreous often liquefies and may collapse. This is more likely to occur, and occurs much earlier, in eyes that are nearsighted (myopia). It can also occur after injuries to the eye or inflammation in the eye (uveitis).

The collagen fibres of the vitreous are held apart by electrical charges. With aging, these charges tend to reduce, and the fibres may clump together. Similarly, the gel may liquefy, a condition known as synaeresis, allowing cells and other organic clusters to float freely within the vitreous humour. These allow floaters which are perceived in the visual field as spots or fibrous strands. Floaters are generally harmless, but the sudden onset of recurring floaters may signify a posterior vitreous detachment or other diseases of the eye.

Posterior vitreous detachment: Once liquid vitreous enters the sub-hyaloid space between the vitreous cortex and the retina, it may strip the vitreous cortex off the retina with each eye movement (see Saccade).

===Postmortem and forensic===
After death, the vitreous resists putrefaction longer than other body fluids. Within the hours, days and weeks after death, the vitreous potassium concentration rises, at such a predictable speed that vitreous potassium levels are frequently used to estimate the time since death (post-mortem interval) of a corpse.

The metabolic exchange and equilibration between systemic circulation and vitreous humour is so slow that vitreous humour is sometimes the fluid of choice for postmortem analysis of glucose levels or substances which would be more rapidly diffused, degraded, excreted or metabolized from the general circulation.

According to Jewish religion, extracting the vitreous fluid for forensic chemical analysis is preferred to blood analysis (in case a forensic or post-mortem toxicology test is deemed necessary). This avoids the loss of even a few droplets of blood from the body prior to burial.

<text>Vitrectomy is a surgery to remove some or all of the vitreous humor from the eye.

Anterior vitrectomy entails removing small portions of the vitreous humor from the front structures of the eye—often because these are tangled in an intraocular lens or other structures.

&quot;Pars plana&quot; vitrectomy is a general term for a group of operations accomplished in the deeper part of the eye, all of which involve removing some or all of the vitreous humor—the eye&#x27;s clear internal jelly.

Even before the modern era, some surgeons performed crude vitrectomies. For instance, Dutch surgeon Anton Nuck (1650–1692) claimed to have removed vitreous by suction in a young man with an inflamed eye. In Boston, John Collins Warren (1778–1856) performed a crude limited vitrectomy for angle closure glaucoma.

== Anesthesia for vitrectomy ==
Options for anesthesia for vitrectomy are general anaesthesia, local anesthesia, topical anesthesia and intracameral lidocaine irrigation.

Each anesthesia technique has its advantages and disadvantages, and the selection of anesthesia will depend on various factors including the surgeon&#x27;s and patient&#x27;s choice, disease and additional surgical steps required.

== &quot;Pars plana&quot; vitrectomy ==
Vitrectomy was originated by Robert Machemer with contributions from Thomas M. Aaberg Sr in late 1969 and early 1970. The original purpose of vitrectomy was to remove clouded vitreous humor—usually containing blood.

The success of these first procedures led to the development of techniques and instruments to remove clouding and also to peel scar tissue off the light sensitive lining of the eye—the retina—membranectomy, to provide space for materials injected in the eye to reattach the retina such as gases or liquid silicone, and to increase the efficacy of other surgical steps such as scleral buckle.

The development of new instruments and surgical strategies through the 1970s and 1980s was spearheaded by surgeon and engineer Steve Charles. More recent advances have included smaller and more refined instruments for use in the eye, the injection of various medications at the time of surgery to manipulate a detached retina into its proper position and mark the location of tissue layers to allow their removal, and for long term protection against scar tissue formation. Several technologies and systems exist to treat vitrectomy.

==Additional surgical steps==
Additional surgical steps involved as part of modern vitrectomy surgeries may include:

Membranectomy – removal of layers of unhealthy tissue from the retina with minute instruments such as forceps (tiny grasping tools), picks (miniature hooks), and visco-dissection (separating layers of tissue with jets of fluid.) This layer of unhealthy tissue is called an epiretinal membrane and it can occur in anyone, but is more likely to occur in the elderly or in people who have had prior eye disease or eye surgery. If the patient has an epiretinal membrane and is also complaining of symptoms such as decreased visual acuity, then a membranectomy is performed in addition to the vitrectomy. Complications of this additional step are similar to complications of the standard vitrectomy procedure.

Fluid/air exchange – injection of air into the eye to remove the intraocular fluid from the posterior segment of the globe while maintaining intraocular pressure to temporarily hold the retina in place or seal off holes in the retina. The air pressure is temporary as the posterior segment will soon re-fill with fluid.

Air/gas exchange – In some cases, gas can be used to help hold the retina in place. Gas, or more typically mixed gas and air, is injected through the sclera and into the posterior segment of the globe. This procedure is often referred to as pneumatic retinopexy. Typical gases used are perfluoropropane or sulfur hexafluoride. The gases are mixed with air to neutralize their expansive properties to provide for a longer acting (than air alone) retinal tamponade. The retinal tamponade acts to hold the retina in place or temporarily seal off holes in the retina. The mixed gases disappear spontaneously once they have accomplished their purpose and the posterior segment re-fills with fluid.

Silicone oil injection – Similar to an air/gas exchange, or pneumatic retinopexy, the eye can also be filled with liquid silicone to hold the retina in place. In contrast to the pneumatic retinopexy, however, the silicone oil remains in the eye until it is later removed surgically. Oils have less surface tension and buoyancy than gases so the tension exerted by the oil is about 30 times less than that of the gas.

Photocoagulation – In cases when there is a tear in the retina, or when there are unhealthy damaging blood vessels (which can be seen in patients with diabetic retinopathy), laser treatment can be used. In such cases, the laser is used to seal the hole or prevent growth of the unhealthy, damaging blood vessels.

Scleral buckling – placement of a support positioned like a belt around the eyeball to maintain the retina in a proper, attached position. This is referred to as an &quot;exoplant&quot;. Placement of the scleral buckle for patients who have had a retinal detachment has been shown to lead to reattachment approximately 80 to 90 percent of the time after one surgery. In cases of failure, most patients are treated with vitrectomy.

Lensectomy – In some cases, a lensectomy, or &quot;cataract surgery&quot;, is done in conjunction with the vitrectomy. This extra procedure is performed when the lens of eye is cloudy (cataract), damaged during the vitrectomy, if there is attached to scar tissue, or if the pressure in the eye needs to be lowered (as in the case with some glaucomatous patients).

==Indications==

Conditions which can benefit from vitrectomy include:

Retinal detachment – a blinding condition where the lining of the eye peels loose and floats freely within the interior of the eye. Steps to reattach the retina may include vitrectomy to clear the inner jelly, scleral buckling to create a support for the reattached retina, membranectomy to remove scar tissue, injection of dense liquids to smooth the retina into place, photocoagulation to bond the retina back against the wall of the eye, and injection of a gas or silicone oil to secure the retina in place as it heals.

Macular pucker – formation of a patch of unhealthy tissue in the central retina (the macula) distorting vision. Also called epiretinal membrane. After vitrectomy to remove the vitreous gel, membranectomy is undertaken to peel away the tissue.

Diabetic retinopathy – may damage sight by either a non-proliferative or proliferative retinopathy. The proliferative type is characterized by formation of new unhealthy, freely bleeding blood vessels within the eye (called vitreal hemorrhage) and/or causing thick fibrous scar tissue to grow on the retina, detaching it. Often diabetic retinopathy is treated in early stages with a laser in the physician&#x27;s office to prevent these problems. When bleeding or retinal detachment occur, vitrectomy is employed to clear the blood, membranectomy removes scar tissue, and injection of gas or silicone with scleral buckle may be needed to return sight. Diabetics should have an eye exam yearly.

Macular holes – the normal shrinking of the vitreous humor with aging can occasionally tear the central retina causing a macular hole with a blind spot blocking sight.

Vitreous hemorrhage – bleeding in the eye from injuries, retinal tears, subarachnoid hemorrhages (as Terson syndrome), or blocked blood vessels. Once blood is removed, photocoagulation with a laser can shrink unhealthy blood vessels or seal retinal holes.

Vitreous floaters – deposits of various size, shape, consistency, refractive index, and motility within the eye&#x27;s normally transparent vitreous humor which can obstruct vision. Here pars plana vitrectomy has been shown to relieve symptoms. Because of possible side effects it is used only in severe cases.

==Complications==
There are a few complications that can result from vitrectomy surgery. Cataract is the most frequent complication. Many patients will develop a cataract within the first few years after surgery. Because there have been no published controlled trials evaluating the benefits and risks stemming from post vitrectomy cataract surgery, ophthalmologists have no clear evidence to rely upon when counseling patients about cataract surgery.

Other common complications include high intraocular pressure, bleeding in the eye, and retinal edema, swelling in the back of the eye. In most cases, the retinal edema can be managed with over-the-counter medication. In severe cases, this swelling can be treated with intra-ocular injections.

More severe complications after a vitrectomy are endophthalmitis (inflammation of the fluids in the eye) or suprachoroidal hemorrhage (bleeding above the choroidal layer of the eye). Rates of these complications have been reported to be less than 0.5%.

Lastly, although vitrectomy surgery is often done to correct retinal detachments, a subsequent retinal detachment is a possible complication as well. Rates of retinal detachment have been reported to be less than 5%.

==Recovery==
Patients use eye drops for several weeks, or longer, to allow the surface of the eye to heal. In some cases, heavy lifting is avoided for a few weeks.

A gas bubble may be placed inside the eye, to keep the retina in place. If a gas bubble is used, sometimes a certain head positioning (&quot;posturing&quot;) has to be maintained, such as face down or sleeping on the right or left side. The gas bubble will dissolve over time, but this takes several weeks. Flying should be avoided while the gas bubble is still present.

Problems such as return of the original condition, bleeding, or infection from the surgery may require additional treatment or can result in blindness. In the event that the patient would need to remain face down after surgery, a vitrectomy support system can be rented, to help aid during the recovery time. This particular equipment may be used for as little as five days to as long as three weeks. A Cochrane review found that in one study, cataract surgery was needed within two years for about half of the eyes operated on for idiopathic macular hole, and retinal detachment was found in about one in 20 eyes.

==Outcome==
The return of eyesight after vitrectomy depends on the underlying condition which prompted the need for surgery. It also depends on patient age and their visual acuity before surgery. For example, if the eye is healthy, but filled with blood, then vitrectomy can result in return of 20/20 eyesight. With more serious problems, such as a retina which has detached several times, final sight may be only sufficient to safely walk (ambulatory vision) or less.

With a retinal detachment, some very important considerations are how long the retina has been detached, and what part of the retina was detached. For example, if the macula of the retina comes off too, outcomes might not be as good as they would if the macula was still attached. Also, the longer the time between the detachment and the reattachment, the worse the outcomes. Some ophthalmologists believe that if a patient has a retinal detachment that involves the macula and it has been longer than 6 months, then a vitrectomy for that patient is unlikely to help. However, recent studies have shown that visual improvement might still be found in these patients. Given the high variability between outcomes for different patients with retinal detachments, it is very important to be examined by an ophthalmologist as soon as possible.

A Cochrane review found vitrectomy for patients with idiopatic macular hole improved visual acuity by about 1.5 lines on an acuity chart. Macular hole closure was 76% in those treated with vitrectomy compared to 11% in those observed.

<text>A periplus (), or periplous, is a manuscript document that lists the ports and coastal landmarks, in order and with approximate intervening distances, that the captain of a vessel could expect to find along a shore. In that sense, the periplus was a type of log and served the same purpose as the later Roman itinerarium of road stops. However, the Greek navigators added various notes, which, if they were professional geographers, as many were, became part of their own additions to Greek geography.

The form of the &quot;periplus&quot; is at least as old as the earliest Greek historian, the Ionian Hecataeus of Miletus. The works of Herodotus and Thucydides contain passages that appear to have been based on &quot;peripli&quot;.

==Etymology==
&quot;Periplus&quot; is the Latinization of the Greek word περίπλους (&quot;periplous&quot;, contracted from περίπλοος &quot;periploos&quot;), which is &quot;a sailing-around.&quot; Both segments, &quot;peri-&quot; and &quot;-plous&quot;, were independently productive: the ancient Greek speaker understood the word in its literal sense; however, it developed a few specialized meanings, one of which became a standard term in the ancient navigation of Phoenicians, Greeks, and Romans.

==Known &quot;peripli&quot;==
Several examples of &quot;peripli&quot; that are known to scholars:

=== Carthaginian ===

*The Periplus of Himilco the Navigator, parts which are preserved in Pliny the Elder and Avienius.
*The Periplus of Hanno the Navigator, Carthaginian colonist and explorer who explored the coast of Africa from present-day Morocco southward at least as far as Senegal in the sixth or fifth century BCE.

=== Greek ===

*The &quot;Periplus&quot; of the Greek Scylax of Caryanda, in Caria, who allegedly sailed down the Indus River and then to Suez on the initiative of Darius I. This voyage is mentioned by Herodotus, and his periplus is quoted by Hecataeus of Miletus, Aristotle, Strabo and Avienius.
* The &quot;Euthymenes&quot; description of West Africa (around third quarter of the sixth century). His published accounts have not survived, but seem to have been known, at least at secondhand, by &quot;Plutarch&quot;.
*The &quot;Massaliote Periplus&quot;, a description of trade routes along the coasts of Atlantic Europe, by anonymous Greek navigators of Massalia (now Marseille, France), possibly dates to the sixth century BCE, also preserved in Avienius
*Pytheas of Massilia, (fourth century BCE) &quot;On the Ocean&quot; (Περί του Ωκεανού), has not survived; only excerpts remain, quoted or paraphrased by later authors, including Strabo, Diodorus Siculus, Pliny the Elder and in Avienius&#x27; &quot;Ora maritima&quot;.
*The &quot;Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax&quot;, generally is thought to date to the fourth or third century BCE.
*The Periplus of Nearchus surveyed the area between the Indus and the Persian Gulf under orders from Alexander the Great. He was a source for Strabo and Arrian, among others.
*&quot;On the Red Sea&quot; by Agatharchides. Fragments preserved in Diodorus Siculus and Photius.
* The Periplus of Scymnus of Chios is dated to around 110 BCE.
*The &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot; or Red Sea was written by a Greek of the Hellenistic/Romanized Alexandrian in the first century CE. It provides a shoreline itinerary of the Red (Erythraean) Sea, starting at the port of Berenice. Beyond the Red Sea, the manuscript describes the coast of India as far as the Ganges River and the east coast of Africa (called Azania). The unknown author of the &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot; claims that Hippalus, a mariner, was knowledgeable about the &quot;monsoon winds&quot; that shorten the round-trip from India to the Red Sea. Also according to the manuscript, the Horn of Africa was called, &quot;the Cape of Spices,&quot; and modern day Yemen was known as the &quot;Frankincense Country.&quot;
*The &quot;Periplus Ponti Euxini&quot;, a description of trade routes along the coasts of the Black Sea, written by Arrian (in Greek Αρριανός) in the early second century CE.
*The &quot;Stadiasmus Maris Magni&quot;, it was written by an anonymous author and is dated to the second half of the third century AD.

==&quot;Rahnāmag&quot;==
Persian sailors had long had their own sailing guide books, called &quot;Rahnāmag&quot; in Middle Persian (&quot;Rahnāmeh&quot; رهنامه in Modern Persian).

They listed the ports and coastal landmarks and distances along the shores.

The lost but much-cited sailing directions go back at least to the 12th century. Some described the Indian Ocean as &quot;a hard sea to get out of&quot; and warned of the &quot;circumambient sea,&quot; with all return impossible.

==Tactic of naval combat==
A &quot;periplus&quot; was also an ancient naval maneuver in which attacking &quot;triremes&quot; would outflank or encircle the defenders to attack them in the rear.

<doc id="328860" wikidata="Q183019" url="?curid=328860" title="Mill (currency)">
<text>The mill (American English) or mil (Commonwealth English, except Canada) is a unit of currency, used in several countries as one-thousandth of the base unit. It is symbolized as ₥, the MILL SIGN character in Unicode. 

In the United States, it is a notional unit equivalent to a thousandth of a United States dollar (a hundredth of a dime or a tenth of a cent). In the United Kingdom, it was proposed during the decades of discussion on decimalisation as a division of sterling&#x27;s pound. While this system was never adopted in the United Kingdom, the currencies of some British or formerly British territories did adopt it, such as the Palestine pound and the Maltese lira.

The term comes from the Latin &quot;millesimum&quot;, meaning &quot;thousandth part&quot;.

==Usage==

===United States===

In the United States, the term was first used by the Continental Congress in 1786, being described as the &quot;lowest money of account, of which 1000 shall be equal to the federal dollar&quot;.

The Coinage Act of 1792 describes milles and other subdivisions of the dollar: 

The US Mint in Philadelphia made half cents worth 5 mills each from 1793 to 1857.

Tokens in this denomination were issued by some states and local governments (and by some private interests) for such uses as payment of sales tax. These were of inexpensive materials such as tin, aluminium, plastic or paper. Rising inflation depreciated the value of these tokens in relation to the value of their constituent materials; this depreciation led to their eventual abandonment. Virtually none were made after the 1960s.

Today, most Americans would refer to fractions of a cent rather than mills, a term that is widely unknown. For example, a gasoline price of $3.019 per gallon, if pronounced in full, would be &quot;three dollars [and] one and nine-tenths cents&quot; or &quot;three &lt;point&gt; zero-one-nine dollars&quot;. Discount coupons, such as those for grocery items, usually include in their fine print a statement such as &quot;Cash value less than of 1 cent&quot;. There are also common occurrences of &quot;half-cent&quot; discounts on goods bought in quantity. However, the term &quot;mill&quot; is still used when discussing billing in the electric power industry as shorthand for the lengthier &quot; of a dollar per kilowatt hour&quot;. The term is also commonly used when discussing stock prices, the issuance of the founder&#x27;s stock of a company, and cigarette taxes.

====Property tax====

Property taxes are also expressed in terms of mills per dollar assessed (a mill levy, known more widely in the US as a &quot;mill rate&quot;). For instance, with a millage rate of 2.8₥, a house with an assessment of would be taxed , or . The term is often spelled &quot;mil&quot; when used in this context.

With respect to property taxes, a &quot;mil&quot; is also slang for one million units of currency, especially as a rate expressed per mille &quot;‰&quot;, as one million units of currency per milliard on the long scale of numeration, that is, 1,000,000 per 1,000,000,000 currency units of assessed valuation on all private property throughout the &quot;mill yard&quot; or property tax levy district.

====Finance====
The term mill is often used in finance, particularly in conjunction with equity market microstructure. For example, a broker that charges 5 mils per share is taking in $5 every 1000 shares traded. Additionally, in finance the term is sometimes spelled &quot;mil&quot;. Cf. basis point.

Some exchanges allow prices to be accounted in ten-thousandths of a dollar ($29.4125 = 29,412.5₥ for example). This last digit is sometimes called a &quot;decimill&quot; or &quot;deci-mill&quot;, but no exchange officially recognizes the term.

====Fiction====

Mark Twain introduced a fictional elaboration of the mill in his 1889 novel &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot;. When Hank Morgan, the American time traveler, introduces decimal currency to Arthurian Britain, he has it denominated in cents, mills, and &quot;milrays&quot;, or tenths of a mill (the name perhaps suggested by &quot;myriad&quot;, meaning ten thousand or by the Portuguese and Brazilian milreis).

===Canada===
In Canada, the mill rate system is fundamental for calculating property taxes at the municipal level, reflecting the amount of tax per $1,000 of assessed property value. Municipalities determine annual mill rates based on budget needs for public services like education, infrastructure, healthcare, and law enforcement.

This calculation helps standardize property taxes while allowing flexibility to address specific financial needs in each locality. Mill rates are subject to adjustment annually or periodically, depending on factors like government spending requirements, economic conditions, and shifts in property valuations, providing a fair and balanced approach to local tax funding.

For example, if a property is valued at $100,000 and the mill rate is set at 50, the tax due would be calculated as: 100,000 × (50 / 1000) = 5,000. This straightforward calculation offers transparency for taxpayers and aids municipalities in consistent revenue collection.

===United Kingdom===
Proposed on several occasions as a means of decimalising sterling under the &quot;pound and mil&quot; system suggested in 1855 by Sir William Brown MP, the mil was occasionally used in accounting.

The 1862 report from the &quot;Select committee on Weights and Measures&quot; noted that the Equitable Insurance Company had been keeping accounts in mils (rather than in shillings and pence) for such purposes for over 100 years. Such a unit of a thousandth of a pound would have also been similar in value to the farthing coin (worth of a pound).

By the time British currency was decimalised in 1971, the farthing had been demonetised eleven years prior, in part due to having its value eroded by inflation; thus, the mil was no longer necessary.

===Malta===
The Maltese lira was decimalised in 1972 on the &quot;pound and mil&quot; system. The coinage included denominations of 2 mils, 3 mils, and 5 mils from 1972 to 1994, with 10 mils being equal to one cent. While prices could still be marked using mils until 2008, when the country switched to the euro, in practice these were rounded off for accounting purposes.

=== Mandatory Palestine, Israel, Jordan ===

The Palestine pound, used as the currency of the British Mandate for Palestine from 1927 to 1948, was divided into 1,000 mils. Its successor currencies, the Israeli lira and the Jordanian dinar retained the division, respectively named the &quot;pruta&quot; and &quot;fils&quot;. The Israeli pruta lasted until 1960, and the Jordanian fils until 1992, and in Supermarket prices and taxi meters well into the 21st century.

===Hong Kong===
Between 1863 and 1866 the one mil coin was the lowest denomination issued by the British government in Hong Kong; it was eliminated due to its unpopularity.

===Cyprus===
The Cypriot pound was decimalised using the &quot;pound and mil&quot; system in 1955 and lasting until 1983. However, coins smaller than 5 mils ceased being used in the mid 1960s. When switched to cents in 1983, a ½-cent coin was struck that was abolished a few years later.

===Tunisia===
Coins are minted in 10, 20, 50, and 100 &quot;millimes&quot;, thousandths of a Tunisian dinar. Older coins of 5 &quot;millimes&quot; remain in circulation.

==Related units==

*The Egyptian pound is divided into 1,000 &quot;milliemes&quot;, 10 milliemes equal 1 piastre (25 piastres is the smallest currently-minted coin).
*The Tunisian dinar is divided into 1,000 &quot;millimes&quot; (10 millimes is the smallest currently-minted coin).
*The Kuwaiti dinar, Bahraini dinar, Jordanian dinar, and Iraqi dinar are divided into 1,000 &quot;fils&quot;. The smallest coins currently minted are 5 fils (Kuwait and Bahrain), 1/4 dinar (Jordan), 25 dinars (Iraq).
*The Omani rial is divided into 1,000 &quot;baisa&quot;.
*The Libyan dinar has been divided into 1,000 &quot;dirhams&quot; since 1971.
*The Japanese yen was formerly divided into 1,000 &quot;rin&quot;. An early proposed (but not accepted) design for the 1-rin coin used &quot;1 mil&quot; in the Romanized text.

<doc id="328865" wikidata="Q7406104" url="?curid=328865" title="Saltfleet">
<text>Saltfleet is a coastal village in the East Lindsey district of Lincolnshire, England. It is approximately north of Mablethorpe and east of Louth.

The village is part of the civil parish of Skidbrooke with Saltfleet Haven, which had a population of 523 at the 2001 Census, increasing to 543 at the 2011 Census.

Saltfleet has a village store with adjoining cafe, a petrol station, a seasonal fish and chip shop and numerous caravan sites (Sunnydale, Beach, Tuxworth, Kindswood, Sandyfields and New Inn). The beaches at Saltfleet attract visitors for days out and holidays, some of whom gather samphire on the coast close to the village.

==History==
The parish church is a Grade I listed building, dedicated to Saint Botolph, dating from the 13th century. The font is 13th-century. There is a gravestone to a rector of the parish who died in 1413, set in the chancel floor. The church is now redundant.

Saltfleet has a Grade II listed 19th-century windmill. There are two public houses; the New Inn, a Grade II listed building, dating from the 17th century, and The Crown Inn, which is over 200 years old.

Opposite the New Inn is the Manor House, built in 1673, a date referred to as inscribed against the names of Robert Fox and Jane Hardy in a first floor room. &quot;Lincolnshire Life&quot; magazine published articles on the Manor House: in February 2008 in its Homes and Gardens page; in May 1970; and during the 1960s when it mentioned former occupants, including the 1670s owner, Lord Willoughby, a friend of Oliver Cromwell.

Adjacent to the Manor House is a red brick Methodist chapel dating from 1815.

A listed limestone village pump was erected in 1899 in memory of F. A. Freshney who died from wounds inflicted while fighting in South Africa.

Some Roman pottery has been found in the village.

==Governance==
An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward stretches south west to Little Carlton with a total population taken at the 2011 census of 2,066.

==Geography and ecology==
A section of the parish seashore is salt marsh between Saltfleet and the North Sea. Many halophyte plant species are found there including &quot;Armeria maritima&quot;, &quot;Halimione portulacoides&quot; and &quot;Limonium vulgare&quot;. Wildlife includes skipper butterfly, shore crab and sky lark. south of the village is Saltfleetby-Theddlethorpe Dunes National Nature Reserve. Grey seals breed north in Donna Nook nature reserve within the Saltfleet and North Somercotes parishes.

<doc id="328867" wikidata="Q1017345" url="?curid=328867" title="Safari jacket">
<text>A safari jacket or bush jacket also known as a “shacket” is a garment originally designed for the purpose of going on safari in the African bush. When paired with trousers or shorts, it becomes a safari suit. A safari jacket is commonly a lightweight cotton drill or lighter poplin jacket, traditionally khaki in color, with a self-belt, epaulets, four or more expandable bellows pockets and often with cartridge loops.

==History==

Lightweight, light-coloured uniforms were worn by European soldiers serving in warm climates from the 19th century and, little altered, throughout World War II. They typically featured epaulettes, pleated pockets, belts and other features later found on safari jackets.

The earliest reference to a &#x27;safari suit&#x27; listed in &quot;The Oxford English Dictionary&quot; is from an American newspaper in 1935. In 1936, author and adventurer Ernest Hemingway designed a &#x27;bush jacket&#x27; which was made by Willis &amp; Geiger Outfitters. In 1939, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch advertised safari jackets, shorts and trousers, of &#x27;coat shirt style&#x27; for sports and leisure wear.
In the 1960s and 1970s, safari suits became fashionable thanks to designer versions for men and women by, for example, French designers Ted Lapidus and Yves Saint Laurent, both of whom are among those credited with inventing and popularising the look.

==Australia==

The safari suit is popularly associated with Australian fashion in the 1970s. It was sometimes worn by the former South Australian Premier Don Dunstan.

On 7 March 1974, male politicians in the Northern Territory were given permission by the Speaker of the House Les MacFarlane to wear safari suits during sittings of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. It was granted at the request of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Jon Isaacs. The Speaker of the House said:

Honourable members, I have received a further request that the standard of male dress be relaxed to include safari jackets. I have been in touch with the federal parliament and I find that the Speaker, Sir Billy Snedden, is allowing safari jackets with shirt and tie. He also allows one member to wear a safari jacket over an open-necked shirt. Therefore, I have decided to accept safari jackets as suitable dress in the Assembly. I must say that I do this very reluctantly because I feel that we have relaxed our standards too far. However, the precedent has been set. I might add that I will not allow T-shirts.

Charles, Prince of Wales famously wore a safari suit on his visit to Ayers Rock with Diana, Princess of Wales in 1983.

Decades after they had ceased being fashionable, then-father of the house Philip Ruddock wore a safari suit into the Australian House of Representatives during Question Time in 2015 as part of a charity drive.

==India==

In India, the safari suit gained popularity through the 1970s influenced to a large degree by films (James Bond/Roger Moore) and some fashions trends from the west for warmer climates. The safari suit in India gained prominence when local synthetic fibre manufacture and supply was significantly increased in the later half of the 1970s.

Reliance Industries and other textile manufactures set up synthetic fibre plants in India significantly reducing the price of synthetic fibre and the Indian middle class jumped at the opportunity to be well dressed in a fabric which, though unsuited to India&#x27;s climate was fairly cheap, easy to maintain and long-lasting. The safari suit continued to be the de facto business attire, particularly in government/public sectors and the SMB arena in India, through the late-1990s. With India&#x27;s growth over the 1990s, liberalization and with the middle class suddenly having more disposable income, the younger generations began to gravitate towards more modern western fashions such as suits and other business attire. Although it is still visible in some parts of India, the Safari suit is now indelibly associated with the so-called License Raj—the slow, inefficient Indian bureaucracy of the 1970s and the 1980s.

==Revival==

Beginning in the mid 2010s, a variant of the bush jacket, known as a shirt jacket or &quot;shacket&quot;, underwent a revival in the UK and Europe due to the popularisation of vintage workwear by the hipster subculture. These were frequently made from blue denim, cambric, seersucker, heavy cotton in olive green or khaki, natural linen, or camouflage cloth, and featured patch pockets. Some had the epaulets, belt, and pocket flaps of the traditional safari jacket, while others did not.

<text>Korean mythology () is the group of myths told by historical and modern Koreans. There are two types: the written, literary mythology in traditional histories, mostly about the founding monarchs of various historical kingdoms, and the much larger and more diverse oral mythology, mostly narratives sung by shamans or priestesses (mansin) in rituals invoking the gods and which are still considered sacred today.

The historicized state-foundation myths representing the bulk of the literary mythology are preserved in Classical Chinese-language works such as &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; and &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;. One state&#x27;s foundation myth, that of the first Korean kingdom of Gojoseon by legendary king Dangun, has become the founding myth of the whole Korean nation. State-foundation myths are further divided into northern, such as that of the kingdom of Goguryeo and its founder Jumong, where the founder is the son of a celestial male figure and an earthly female figure, and southern, such as that of the kingdom of Silla and its founder Hyeokgeose, where the founder begins as an object descended from the heavens, and himself marries an earthly woman. Other literary myths include the origin myths of family lineages recorded in genealogies.

The narratives of Korean shamanism, the country&#x27;s indigenous religion, feature a diverse array of both gods and humans. They are recited in ritual contexts both to please the gods and to entertain the human worshippers. As oral literature, the shamanic narrative is regularly revised with each performance, although a certain degree of consistency is required; new narratives have appeared since the 1960s. It has frequently been at odds with the official ideologies of Korean society, and its mythology is often characterized as subversive of traditional norms such as patriarchy.

The shamanic mythology is divided into five regional traditions, with each region having original narratives, as well as distinctive versions of pan-Korean narratives. The mythological tradition of southern Jeju Island is especially divergent. The two narratives found in all but one region respectively are the &quot;Jeseok bon-puri&quot;, featuring a girl who in most versions is impregnated by a supernaturally potent Buddhist priest—who was probably originally a sky god—and gives birth to triplets who themselves become gods; and the &quot;Princess Bari&quot;, about a princess who is abandoned by her father for being a girl and who later resurrects her dead parents with the flower of life.

==Introduction==

Korean mythology comprises two distinct corpora of literature. The first is the literary mythology (, ) recorded in the traditional Korean histories, such as the thirteenth-century work &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;. The myths contained in these volumes are heavily , to the point that it is often difficult to differentiate between historical fact and mythology. The primary literary myths are the state-foundation myths (, ), which recount the story of how a particular kingdom or dynasty was founded, although the category also includes other supernatural stories found in the historical chronicles as well as the origin myths of non-royal lineages.

The second corpus is the modern oral mythology (, ), which is &quot;incomparably&quot; richer than the literary tradition in both sheer quantity of material and the diversity of themes and content. The oral mythology primarily consists of the shamanic narratives (, ), which are sung by Korean shamans during &quot;gut&quot;, religious ceremonies in which shamans invoke the gods. While also mythological in content, these narratives are very different in function and content from the literary myths. The state-foundation myths are preserved only in writing, deprived of their original ritual context, and have existed in written form for centuries. By contrast, the shamanic narratives are oral literature that is &quot;living mythology,&quot; sacred religious truth to the participants of the &quot;gut&quot;. They began to be published only in 1930, centuries after the first attestation of the literary myths. Unlike the historicized accounts of the literary myths, shamans&#x27;s songs feature elements such as the primordial history of the world, the ascent of human individuals to divinity, and divine retribution upon impious mortals.

The academic study of Korean mythology began with the literary myths, with historians such as Choe Nam-seon (1890–1957) and Yi Pyong-do (1896–1989) pioneering the first studies of state-foundation myths. But research into the much richer oral corpus was minimal until the 1960s, when the study of the shamanic narratives was spearheaded by scholars such as Kim Yeol-gyu (1932–2013), who applied structuralist, comparative, and myth-ritual approaches to the songs, Hyeon Yong-jun (1931–2016), who published a vast encyclopedia of Jeju ritual and mythology, and Seo Daeseok (born 1942), who established the literary study of the shamanic narratives and whose comprehensive work on the &quot;Jeseok bon-puri&quot; narrative proved a model for future researchers. Recent trends in the study of Korean mythology since the 1990s include a greater focus on comparisons with neighboring mythologies, new research into the hitherto neglected village-shrine myths (, ) that involve the patron god of one specific village, and feminist interpretations. Bella Myong-wol Dalton-Fenkl and renowned folklorist Heinz Insu Fenkl wrote &quot;Korean Myths,&quot; published by Thames and Hudson in 2024, that provides a comprehensive introduction to Korean Mythology. 

The oral mythology is always religious, and must be distinguished from the broader corpus of Korean folklore, which might be secular. For instance, the &quot;Woncheon&#x27;gang bon-puri&quot;, a Jeju shamanic narrative about a girl who goes in search for her parents and becomes a goddess, is either descended from or ancestral to a very similar mainland Korean folktale called the Fortune Quest. But because the &quot;Woncheon&#x27;gang bon-puri&quot; is a sacred story about a goddess, unlike the Fortune Quest, the former is a myth and the latter is not. Some Korean myths are mythicized folktales, while many Korean folktales are desacralized myths.

==Literary mythology==
===State-foundation myths===

State-foundation myths narrate the life of the first ruler of a new Korean kingdom or dynasty. They include the founder&#x27;s supernatural birth, the story of how the founder came to create his kingdom, and his miraculous death or departure. They are often interpreted as euhemerized accounts of actual events that happened during the kingdom&#x27;s founding.

The oldest surviving accounts of the founding myths of the ancient Korean kingdoms—such as Gojoseon, Goguryeo, and Silla—are transcribed in Classical Chinese in Korean texts compiled during or after the twelfth century. Such texts include &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;, &quot;Jewang ungi&quot;, &quot;Eungje siju&quot;, and &quot;Tongguk t&#x27;onggam&quot;. These texts were compiled on the basis of earlier sources that are now lost. Several ancient Chinese texts are also important contemporaneous sources for myths; these include not only the official dynastic histories such as the third-century &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; and the sixth-century &quot;Book of Wei&quot;, but also more general texts such as the &quot;Lunheng&quot;, written in 80 CE. In the case of Goguryeo, there are also five Chinese-language stelae narrating the kingdom&#x27;s foundation myth from the perspective of the Goguryeo people themselves. The oldest of the five is the Gwanggaeto Stele, erected in 414 CE.

The founding myth of the Goryeo dynasty, which ruled Korea from the tenth to the fourteenth centuries, is recorded in &quot;Goryeo-sa&quot;, the official dynastic history published in the fifteenth century. &quot;Yongbieocheon&#x27;ga&quot;, a poem published around the same time as &quot;Goryeo-sa&quot; by the succeeding Joseon dynasty, is sometimes seen as the Joseon foundation myth, but it is debated whether &quot;Yongbieocheon&#x27;ga&quot; should be seen as having a narrative at all. As the Joseon were the final Korean dynasty, there are no newer founding myths.

State foundation myths were once also narrated orally, perhaps by shamans. The poet Yi Gyu-bo (1168–1241) mentions that both written and spoken forms of the Goguryeo foundation myth were known during his lifetime, even though the kingdom itself had fallen more than five centuries earlier. The modern &quot;Jeseok bon-puri&quot; shamanic narrative has many structural parallels to the Goguryeo myth and may be a direct descendant of the ancient tale.

The ancient (pre-Goryeo) state-foundation myths are classified into two major types, northern and southern, though both share the central motif of a king associated with the heavens. In the northern kingdoms of Gojoseon, Buyeo, and Goguryeo, the founding monarch is born from the coupling of a celestial male figure and an earthly woman. In the southern kingdoms of Silla and Geumgwan Gaya, the king is generated from a physical object that descends from heaven, and then marries an earthly woman himself. In the northern myths, the demigod king succeeds his heavenly father or creates a new kingdom himself. In the south, the celestial being is crowned by the consensus of local chieftains.

==== Northern kingdoms ====
=====Gojoseon=====
The foundation myth of Gojoseon, the earliest Korean kingdom, is first recorded in two nearly contemporaneous works: &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;, a history compiled by the Buddhist monk Iryeon around the late 1270s, and &quot;Jewang ungi&quot;, a Chinese-language epic poem written in 1287.

Iryeon&#x27;s account is as follows. Hwanung, a younger son of the sky god Hwanin (who the monk identifies with the Buddhist god Indra), desires to rule the human world. Hwanin sees that his son could &quot;broadly benefit the human world,&quot; and gives him three unspecified treasures to take with him to earth. Hwanung descends beneath a sacred tree on Mount Taebaek (), where he and his three thousand followers found the &quot;Sacred City.&quot; With the gods of wind, rain, and cloud, Hwanin supervises various human affairs.

A bear and a tiger then ask that Hwanung turn them into humans. The god gives the animals twenty pieces of garlic and a clump of sacred mugwort, and tells them that they will become humans if they eat them and do not see sunlight for a hundred days. The two animals then fast, and the bear becomes a woman on the twenty-first day. The tiger fails to fast and remains an animal. The bear-turned-woman prays for a child at the sacred tree, and Hwanung grants her wish by becoming a human to marry her. She gives birth to a boy named Dangun Wanggeom, who founds the kingdom of Gojoseon at the site of Pyongyang. Dangun rules for fifteen centuries, then departs from the kingdom when the Chinese King Wu of Zhou sends Jizi to rule over Korea. The king ultimately becomes a mountain god.

The Dangun myth is of the northern type, featuring the founder&#x27;s birth from a celestial father (Hwanung) and an earthly mother (the bear). It is often interpreted as a mythicized account of interactions between three clans whose totemic symbols or mythological ancestors were a sky god, a bear, and a tiger respectively. The tiger-associated clan was somehow eliminated, but the bear clan joined the dominant sky god clan in the establishment of the Gojoseon polity. Folklorist James H. Grayson draws connections to the Japanese foundation myth. Ninigi-no-Mikoto descends to earth with three treasures as well, and the first Japanese emperor Jinmu is a younger son like Hwanung. Grayson also notes Siberian myths where a bear is the mother of a tribal ancestor.

Dangun appears to have been worshipped only locally in the Pyongyang area until the thirteenth century, when intellectuals attempted to bolster the legitimacy of the Korean state, then imperiled by Mongol invasion and domination, by establishing him as the ancestor of all Korean polities. By the twentieth century he had become accepted as the mythical founder of the Korean nation and plays an important role in the ideologies of both North and South Korea.

=====Buyeo, Goguryeo, and Baekje=====
The foundation myth of the northern kingdom of Goguryeo is recorded in detail in both the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, the oldest surviving work of Korean history, compiled in 1145, and the &quot;Dongmyeongwang-pyeon&quot;, a Chinese-language epic poem written by the poet Yi Gyu-bo in 1193. Yi&#x27;s work is much longer and more detailed than the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, but much of this may be due to the poet&#x27;s own literary embellishment. The &quot;Dongmyeongwang-pyeon&quot; myth is summarized below.

Haeburu, ruler of the kingdom of Buyeo, is childless. One day, he finds a boy in the shape of a golden frog (Korean pronunciation of Classical Chinese: ) and adopts him as his son. Some time later, Haeburu moves his court towards the Sea of Japan, where he founds the kingdom of Eastern Buyeo (Dong-Buyeo).

Haemosu, son of the sky god, descends to Haeburu&#x27;s former capital in 59 BCE on a chariot steered by five dragons and founds a new kingdom there. One day, Haemosu encounters the three beautiful daughters of the god of the Yalu River and abducts Yuhwa, the oldest. The outraged river god challenges him to a shapeshifting duel but is bested. The river god concedes his defeat and allows Haemosu to marry Yuhwa, but after the marriage the former returns to the heavens without his wife.

The river god sends Yuhwa into exile. She is captured by a fisherman and brought to Geumwa the frog-king, who has succeeded his adopted father in Eastern Buyeo. He keeps her in an annex of the palace. One day, sunlight falls on Yuhwa from the heavens, impregnating her. She gives birth to an egg from her left armpit, and a boy hatches from the egg. The boy is supernaturally potent, including shooting down flies with a bow—for which he is named Jumong, &quot;good archer.&quot; The king makes Jumong the stable-keeper, which offends him enough that he decides to found his own kingdom. With three companions, Jumong flees south, leaving his mother and wife behind. When they find an unfordable river, Jumong proclaims his divine descent, and the fish and turtles of the river allow them to cross on their backs. Jumong founds the kingdom of Goguryeo in 37 BCE. He is opposed by an established local chieftain named Songyang. After a series of confrontations between the two, Songyang ultimately surrenders when Jumong causes a great flood in his country.

Yuri, Jumong&#x27;s son by his wife he has left behind in Eastern Buyeo, asks his mother who his father is. When she tells him that he does not have any one father, he attempts to kill himself, forcing her to reveal the truth. After solving a riddle his father has left, Yuri finds his father&#x27;s token, a half of a sword. He goes to Goguryeo and meets Jumong. Yuri and Jumong match their halves of the sword, and the sword becomes one while oozing blood. When Jumong asks his son to show his power, the boy rides atop sunlight. Jumong then makes Yuri his heir. In 19 BCE, the king ascends into heaven and does not return. Yuri holds a funeral for his father, using the king&#x27;s whip in place of his missing body, and becomes Goguryeo&#x27;s second king.

The foundation of the southwestern kingdom of Baekje is also linked to the Jumong myth. According to the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, when Yuri is made heir, Jumong&#x27;s two sons by a local wife are excluded from the kingship. These two brothers, Biryu and Onjo, migrate south to found their own kingdoms. Biryu sets up court in an unfavorable place, while Onjo founds Baekje in good terrain in what is now southern Seoul. The former dies of shame when he learns that his brother&#x27;s kingdom is flourishing, and the remnants of his people join Baekje.

The myth of Jumong is of the northern type, with Haemosu as the celestial father and Yuhwa as the earthly woman. Contemporaneous Chinese sources report that Jumong and Yuhwa were both actively worshipped as gods by the Goguryeo people, including in rituals involving shamans. Like the Dangun myth, the story is also subject to euhemerized interpretations. For instance, Seo Daeseok argues that Haemosu symbolizes an ancient iron-using, agricultural sun-worshipping people, that Yuhwa was a member of a riverine group of hunters, farmers, and fishermen, and that Geumwa&#x27;s polity centered on hunting and pastoralism.

The Jumong myth is first attested in the fifth-century Gwanggaeto Stele, but the first-century Chinese text &quot;Lunheng&quot; describes a barbarian tale of a good archer who crosses a river on the backs of fish and turtles to found a new kingdom in the south. However, this figure&#x27;s mother is a slave-girl impregnated by an egg-like energy rather than a goddess who gives birth to a physical egg, and the figure himself founds the kingdom of Buyeo, rather than that of Goguryeo. The Goguryeo foundation myth thus incorporates the myths of Haemosu and Yuri and the Buyeo foundation myth into a single narrative.

==== Southern kingdoms ====

=====Silla=====

The ancient Silla kingdom was originally dominated by three clans: the Bak, the Seok, and the Kim. At some point the Seok were eliminated from power, and all Silla monarchs from then on were children of a Kim father and a Bak mother. All three clans have associated founding myths.

The Bak foundation myth is given in the fullest detail in &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;. Six chieftains of the Gyeongju area convene to found a united kingdom. They see a strange light shining on a well. When they go there, they see a white horse kneeling. The horse ascends to heaven, leaving a large egg behind. The chieftains break open the egg and find a beautiful boy inside, who they name Hyeokgeose.

Some time later, a chicken-dragon gives birth to a beautiful girl with a chicken beak from its left rib. When they wash the girl in a nearby stream, the beak falls off. When the boy and the girl are both thirteen years old, the chieftains crown them as the first king and queen of Silla and give the king the clan name of Bak. Hyeokgeose rules for sixty-one years and ascends to heaven. Seven days later, his dead body drops from the sky. The queen dies soon after. A giant snake prevents the people from holding a funeral until they dismember the body into five parts, which is why Hyeokgeose has five different tombs.

The &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; also records the Seok and Kim foundation myths. In the first, a ship surrounded by magpies lands on the Silla coast after sailing away from Gaya for unspecified reasons. There is a giant chest in the ship, and when they open it they find slaves, treasures, and a young boy inside. The boy, Seok Talhae, reveals that he is a prince of a country called Yongseong (). When he was born in the form of an egg, his father put him inside the chest and sent him away to found his own kingdom abroad. Having settled in Silla, Seok steals the house of the aristocrat Hogong through deceit and marries the eldest daughter of the Silla king, a descendant of Hyeokgeose. He succeeds his father-in-law as king and founds the Seok clan. After his death, he becomes the patron god of a local mountain. A village-shrine &quot;bon-puri&quot; very similar to the Seok Talhae myth is transmitted by modern shamans in the southern island of Jeju.

Hogong appears prominently in the Kim foundation myth as well. One night, Hogong sees a great light in the woods. When he goes closer, he discovers a golden chest hanging from a tree and a white rooster crowing below. He opens the chest and discovers a boy, who he names Alji. Alji is brought to court and made the Silla king&#x27;s heir, but he later abdicates his position. Alji would become the mythical founder of the Kim clan, which would later monopolize the patrilineal line of the Silla kings.

=====Gaya=====

Until their conquest by Silla in the sixth century, the delta of the southern Nakdong River was occupied by the Gaya polities. The &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; preserves the foundation myth of one of the most powerful Gaya kingdoms, that of Geumgwan Gaya. The nine chieftains of the country hear a strange voice announce that heaven has commanded it to found a kingdom there. After singing and dancing as commanded by the voice, a golden chest wrapped in red cloth descends from heaven. When the chieftains open it, they find six golden eggs. The eggs hatch into giant boys, who fully mature in merely two weeks. On the fifteenth day, the six each become kings of the six Gaya kingdoms. The first to hatch, Suro, becomes king of Geumgwan Gaya.

Later, Suro is challenged by the Seok clan&#x27;s founder Seok Talhae. According to the history of Gaya given in &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;, the two engage in a shapeshifting duel, after which Seok acknowledges defeat and flees to Silla. A beautiful princess named Heo Hwang&#x27;ok then arrives on a ship with red sails, bearing great wealth from a distant kingdom called Ayuta. Heo tells Suro that Shangdi has commanded her father to marry her to Suro, and the two become king and queen. They both live for more than 150 years.

The foundation myths of Silla and Gaya are of the southern type, with the founder descending directly from heaven on vessels such as eggs and chests. The myths may also reflect real historical figures and processes. Hyeokgeose may therefore symbolize an ancient migration of northern horse-riders who created the state of Silla with the support of local chieftains, while Seok Talhae stands for a maritime group that was defeated by Gaya and was integrated into the Silla state and Heo Hwang&#x27;ok preserves the historical memory of a merchant group that contributed to the establishment of the early Geumgwan Gaya polity.

===Other literary myths===

Many other supernatural stories are contained in the &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; to the point that Grayson calls its compiler, Iryeon, &quot;the first Korean folklorist.&quot; Some of these stories reflect shamanic mythology. One example is the tale of Cheoyong. Cheoyong, a son of the Dragon King of the East Sea, arrives in the Silla court where he marries a beautiful woman. One night, he goes home to find the smallpox god having sex with his wife. Rather than punish the intruder, Cheoyong only sings a song. The smallpox god is so astounded by his mercy that he repents and agrees to never enter any house with Cheoyong&#x27;s face on its gate. The people of Silla then attach portraits of Cheoyong to their gates. The story of Cheoyong is traditionally interpreted as the myth of a shaman or benevolent deity who wards off the spirit of pestilence, although the exact relationship between Cheoyong&#x27;s song (which survives in two different versions) and Korean shamanic chants continues to be debated.

Another genre of literary mythology are the origin myths of specific family lineages, which are recorded in genealogies. The motif of the founding ancestor&#x27;s birth from a stone or golden chest also appears in the genealogies of many non-royal lineages. Other ancestor myths involve the coupling of a human and a non-human. The Chungju Eo ( &quot;fish&quot;) claim descent from a man who was born to a human mother and a carp father, while the Changnyeong Jo are thought to descend from the offspring of a Silla noblewoman and the son of a dragon.

==Shamanic and oral mythology==
===Nature and context===

The shamanic narratives are works of oral literature sung during &quot;gut&quot;—the Korean term for large-scale shamanic rituals—which constitute the mythology of Korean shamanism, the indigenous polytheistic religion of the country.

Since the long-ruling Joseon dynasty (1392–1910), the attitude of the Korean population towards the traditional religion has been ambivalent. The Joseon, whose state ideology was Neo-Confucianism, were opposed to shamanism and made significant efforts to eliminate the religion from the public sphere. As Koreans increasingly accepted the Joseon state&#x27;s patriarchal and anti-shamanic ideology, shamanism became increasingly associated with women, who were also marginalized by the new social structure. It was in this restrained capacity as women&#x27;s private religion, without public influence, that shamanism was still tolerated by Joseon society.

Despite the continued presence of shamanism as a significant force in Korean religious life, a cultural ambivalence regarding it persists. As of 2016, the capital of Seoul alone has hundreds of ritual places, where &quot;gut&quot; are held on most days of the year. Yet when in public, many worshipers—often Christians or Buddhists as well as practitioners of shamanism—avoid discussing their shamanic worship and sometimes disparage their own beliefs as superstition.

Reflecting this ambivalence, shamanism and its mythology are often characterized as subversive of Korea&#x27;s mainstream values and official culture, though some may also simultaneously incorporate more mainstream thinking such as the Confucian virtues. The story of Princess Bari is a typical example. The myth centers on the princess&#x27;s journey to the world of the dead to save her parents. The story is thus &quot;an affirmation of a Confucian virtue,&quot; that of filial piety. Yet the parents&#x27; savior is not a son but a daughter—indeed, the very daughter that Bari&#x27;s parents abandon at birth merely for being a girl. Later, Bari leaves her husband for her parents, although Confucian culture demands that women transfer their loyalties to their husband&#x27;s family after marriage. The myth therefore can be interpreted to subvert the Confucian framework of patriarchy using the very values of Confucianism.

All shamanic narratives meet the purposes of both religiosity and entertainment, albeit to varying degrees. Shamanic narratives are almost never sung in non-religious circumstances, and the ritual context is critical to a full understanding of the mythology. For instance, the story of Bari is performed at ceremonies where the soul of the deceased is sent off to the realm of the dead. Bari is the goddess that guides the soul on its way, and the story of the princess&#x27;s journey thus further reassures the bereaved that the spirit of their loved one is in good hands. At the same time, shamans also seek to entertain worshippers. This may be done by inserting riddles, popular songs, or humorous or sexual descriptions into the retelling of the myth, or by having the accompanying musicians interrupt the narrative with often vulgar jokes. Such humorous elements also helped convey the subversive message of many shamanic myths, such as criticism of gender hierarchies and class structures.

As oral literature, shamanic narratives are also affected by both the received tradition and the performing shaman&#x27;s original innovations. Many narratives have lengthy formulaic paragraphs and imagery that appear identically throughout multiple versions of the myth or even across multiple myths, and which are memorized by shamans when they first learn the songs. For instance, a series of highly metaphoric descriptions of Bari&#x27;s mother&#x27;s pregnancies is found in all regions where the Princess Bari myth is performed. On the other hand, shamans regularly add new content and reword phrases of the narratives, and the same shaman may even sing different variants of the same myth depending on the specific circumstances of the &quot;gut&quot;. A certain degree of consistency is nonetheless expected; in one case, a Jeju shaman reciting the &quot;Chogong bon-puri&quot; narrative was interrupted ten times for giving inaccurate details until more experienced shamans demanded that he name the man who taught him. The shamanic mythology is thus unusually conservative for oral literature.

Unlike the literary mythology, the shamanic mythology is a living tradition capable of creating new narratives. In the 1960s, an unknown shaman in eastern Gangwon Province adapted the &quot;Simcheong-ga&quot;, a story involving a blind man, into the new &quot;Simcheong-gut&quot; narrative, recited in order to ward off eye disease. The new myth has since become very popular in the region. Another apparently new myth is the &quot;Jemyeon-gut&quot; narrative, which appeared in the city of Gangneung for the first time in 1974 despite not being attested when the same ritual was held in 1966 and 1969. The &quot;Jemyeon-gut&quot; myth has no clear source for its story, and researchers have noted an increase in narrative details from the 1970s to the 1990s. Several other shamanic narratives appear to have been adapted at some point from, or otherwise bear a close relation to, late Joseon-era vernacular literature. Cross-cultural similarities have also been noted between Korean shamanic narratives and other East Asian myths, in particular the mythology of Manchu shamanism.

Korean shamanism is currently undergoing a major restructuring that is not favorable towards a lengthy performance of the mythology. The traditional village community-oriented ceremonies are in decline, while rituals commissioned by individual worshippers are on the rise. The setting of the &quot;gut&quot; has also shifted to ritual places where only the shamans and the relevant worshippers are present, in contrast to the public participation that was traditional for the ceremonies. Most of these individual worshippers have little interest in the mythology itself, sometimes even leaving when the narrative begins, but are very invested in ceremonies specifically related to themselves or their friends and family, such as the &quot;gongsu&quot; rite in which the shaman conveys messages directly from the gods to the worshipper. With the emergence of other forms of entertainment, the entertainment value of shamanic rituals has also declined. In at least Seoul, the performance of the &quot;Princess Bari&quot; is therefore becoming increasingly shorter. As many new shamans now learn narratives from published books or recordings rather than being taught personally by a more experienced shaman as was traditional, the regional diversity of the mythology may also be in decline.

Unlike the Greco-Roman or Norse mythologies familiar to Western readers, the deities of Korean shamanic mythology exist mostly independently of each other. Each shamanic narrative establishes the nature and functions of the deities it is dedicated to, but there are few cases where gods that have previously appeared in their own narratives interact with each other. It is thus not possible to establish a genealogy of the gods.

===Regional traditions===

The shamanic mythology is divided into five regional traditions ( ), representing the primary variations of the two narratives the &quot;Jeseok bon-puri&quot; and the &quot;Princess Bari&quot;, which are both found throughout the Korean peninsula. Each of the five regions also has myths not found in the other regions, as well as distinctive tendencies in the actual performance of the narratives. The mythological tradition of southern Jeju Island is particularly divergent.

A characteristic of Korean mythology is that the corpus is poorest in and near the capital of Seoul—the traditional political, economic, and cultural center of the country—and largest and most diverse in South Hamgyong Province and Jeju Island, the northernmost and southernmost peripheries respectively. The two peripheral mythologies are the most archaic. Several similar myths are found in both Hamgyong and Jeju despite the great distances involved, suggesting that the two mythologies both descend from a common ancient Korean source.

====Northern====

The northern tradition is poorly understood because all of its area is now part of North Korea, where ethnographic research is not feasible. Ethnologist Hong Tae-han calls it a grouping made for convenience&#x27;s sake, as what regional diversity may have existed there is now inaccessible to scholarship. The religion of South Hamgyong Province may form a coherent shamanic tradition independent of other northern shamanism. The South Hamgyong mythology includes a large corpus of unique shamanic narratives, of which the most important is the &quot;Song of Dorang-seonbi and Cheongjeong-gaksi&quot;, centering on a woman who attempts to meet her beloved husband after his death. Other notable South Hamgyong myths include the &quot;Seng-gut&quot; narrative, which combines the creation myth and the &quot;Jeseok bon-puri&quot;; the &quot;Donjeon-puri&quot;, in which a husband and wife become the gods of money; and the &quot;Jim&#x27;gajang&quot; narrative, about three boys who take vengeance on their murderer by reincarnating as his sons. By contrast, Hwanghae Province in North Korea has virtually no shamanic mythology. The ritual and entertainment role played by mythical narratives in other regions is served by an unusually developed tradition of ceremonial dance and theater.

According to a North Korean shaman who defected in 2008, shamanism is widespread in modern North Korea and &quot;de facto&quot; condoned by the state, but the old songs and chants are no longer transmitted.

====West-Central====
The west-central tradition is the mythological tradition of Seoul and its environs, and is distinguished by a strong emphasis on the sacred nature of the narratives. The recitations are primarily addressed to the deity, not the physically present human worshippers. Formulaic phrases of the received tradition are frequently used. Hong Tae-han characterizes the west-central mythology as the most &quot;solemn&quot; of Korean shamanic narratives. This may be because Seoul shamans frequently held ceremonies in the royal palaces for queens and other court women, who would have expected dignity and gravity from the rituals. This region also has the fewest myths. The only specifically west-central narrative is &quot;Seongju-puri&quot;, explaining the origins of the patron god of the household. In the city of Seoul itself, &quot;Princess Bari&quot; is the only shamanic narrative that is performed.

====East Coast and Gyeongsang====
In contrast to the west-central tradition, shamans of the East Coast and Gyeongsang tradition do much to make their narratives entertaining for the human worshippers. Narratives are recited with an unusual level of detail, and the diversity of rhetorical techniques is unprecedented. Indeed, Hong Tae-han refers to the East Coast shaman families as &quot;the most skilled performing arts group in the entirety of Korea.&quot; The musicians go beyond simply providing background music and intervene directly in the performance, while the performing shaman actively interacts with the human audience. Non-shamanic music, such as folk songs or Buddhist hymns, is integrated into the narrative at appropriate moments. Characteristic regional narratives include a very detailed account of the journeys of the Visitors, the gods of smallpox. The region currently has the most vigorous mythological tradition.

====Jeolla====
The Jeolla tradition is characterized by the reduced importance of the pan-Korean narratives, and the greater prominence of two other myths: the &quot;Jangja-puri&quot;, about a rich man who evades the gods of death, and the &quot;Chilseong-puri&quot;, featuring seven brothers who become gods of the Big Dipper. As of 2002, the Jeolla mythology was in decline.

====Jeju====
The Jeju tradition also stresses the sanctity of the myths to the point that the performing shaman always sings the stories while facing the sacrificial altar, turning their back towards the musicians and worshippers. The explicit purpose of the Jeju mythology, as expressed in many narratives directly, is to make the gods &quot;giddy with delight&quot; by retelling them the story of their lives and deeds. The island has the richest corpus of shamanic narratives. The island represents the only tradition where Princess Bari is unknown. The Jeju mythological tradition is also at risk, as the largest Jeju &quot;gut&quot; rituals—which take fourteen days to complete—are seldom fully held nowadays. Several myths are already no longer performed by shamans.

===Creation narratives===
Several Korean shamanic narratives discuss the creation and primordial history of the world. The most complete creation narratives are found in the northern and Jeju traditions, although one is known from the west-central tradition. Several East Coast versions of the &quot;Jeseok bon-puri&quot; also incorporate relevant elements.

The northern and Jeju creation narratives share many elements. In both traditions, the universe is created with the division of heaven and earth, which were originally fused. A giant is often involved in the creation; in one northern narrative, the creator god Mireuk who cleaves heaven and earth is said to have eaten grain by the &quot;seom&quot; (180 liters) and to have worn robes with sleeves twenty feet (6.7 meters) long or wide. In both northern and Jeju myths, a benevolent god is challenged by an usurper who claims rule over the human world. The two gods engage in three contests to decide who will rule. In both, the final challenge is a flower-growing contest, in which the god that grows the better flower will take charge of humanity. The benevolent god grows the (better) flower, but the usurper steals it while the other god sleeps. Having won this final contest, the usurper takes control of the world, but his unjust victory is the source of the evil and suffering of the present world. Both northern and Jeju creation myths also tell of how there were once two suns and two moons, making the world very hot during day and very cold during night, until a deity destroys one of each.

Nonetheless, the northern and Jeju creation myths differ significantly in structure. In the north, the two protagonists are the creator Mireuk and the usurper Seokga. Both are Buddhist names, referring to Maitreya and Shakyamuni respectively. But as the myths are otherwise unrelated to Buddhism, they are believed to be indigenous gods whose original names were at some point replaced. The two gods fight two duels of supernatural power—such as making a river freeze in midsummer, or hitting a bottle of liquor midair and having the liquor float in the air even while the bottle shatters and falls—before the final flower contest. In the majority of narratives, the sun and moon double or disappear after Seokga&#x27;s unjust victory, and the usurper is obliged to embark on a quest to restore cosmic order by retrieving the sun and moon or destroying the doubled ones. Only the northern tradition discusses the creation of humanity; according to one narrative, Mireuk grows insects into humans.

The Jeju creation myth does not show Buddhist influence. In Jeju, the sky god Cheonji-wang descends to earth some time after creation, often to punish an impious man named Sumyeong-jangja. There, he sleeps with an earthly woman and gives her the tokens of two gourd seeds as he returns to the heavens. The woman gives birth to the twins Daebyeol-wang and Sobyeol-wang. When the brothers grow up, they plant the gourd seeds, which grow into gigantic vines that stretch into heaven. The twins climb these vines to enter their father&#x27;s realm. After verifying their parentage, the twins hold a contest to decide who will rule the human world and who the world of the dead. After two riddle contests, the younger twin wins the final flower contest through cheating and takes charge of the living. The realm of Sobyeol-wang, the physical world where humans live, is full of suffering and disorder. But Daebyeol-wang establishes justice and order for his kingdom of the afterlife, where human souls go after death.

===&quot;Jeseok bon-puri&quot;===

The &quot;Jeseok bon-puri&quot; is the only truly pan-Korean myth, being found in all five regional traditions. The mainland versions of the narrative recount the origins of the Jeseok gods, fertility deities that guarantee fortune and agricultural prosperity, as well as often Samsin, the goddess of childbirth. As of the year 2000, there were sixty-one known versions of the &quot;Jeseok bon-puri&quot;, excluding the highly divergent Jeju versions.

All versions share the following basic narrative structure. Danggeum-aegi is the virgin daughter of a nobleman. When her parents and brothers are temporarily absent, a Buddhist priest comes on an alms round to her house. Danggeum-aegi gives alms in the form of rice, but the priest usually stalls for time by spilling all the rice that she gives, so that she must pick them up and offer them again.

In the Jeolla tradition, the priest then briefly grasps her wrist before leaving. In the west-central tradition, Danggeum-aegi eats three of the grains of rice that the priest has spilled. In the northern and East Coast-Gyeongsang traditions, the girl offers the priest lodging in her father&#x27;s room, but he refuses. He consecutively rejects her offer of every room in the mansion until she agrees to share her own room with him, where they have sex. In any case, the girl becomes pregnant. When her family returns, they attempt to kill her to salvage the family&#x27;s honor but fail, sometimes because rocks and earth fall on top of her parents and brothers while celestial light shines on the girl.

In the west-central and Jeolla traditions, they then expel her from the household. Danggeum-aegi successfully finds the priest and gives birth in his presence to sons, usually but not always triplets. The priest abandons Buddhism and starts a family with her and the sons. In the Jeolla tradition, the myth ends here without anybody becoming gods. In the west-central tradition, the priest confers divinity upon his sons with Danggeum-aegi as the Jeseok gods.

In the northern and East Coast-Gyeongsang traditions, the family imprisons Danggeum-aegi in a pit or stone chest, but she miraculously survives and always gives birth to triplet sons. Danggeum-aegi is then brought back to the family. In most versions, the triplets prove to be supernaturally talented, such that the other children repeatedly attempt and fail to murder them out of envy. One day, the triplets ask who their father is. Danggeum-aegi usually gives the names of various trees as their father, but each tree tells the triplets that she is lying. Once she admits the truth, the brothers go out to find their father. When they reach the priest&#x27;s temple, he gives them a series of impossible tasks to verify their parentage. This includes walking in water while wearing paper shoes without making any of the paper wet, crossing a river using only the bones of cows dead for three years, creating a rooster out of straw that perches and crows, and eating a fish and then vomiting it out alive. The triplets succeed in all these tasks, and the priest acknowledges that they are his sons when he sees that his blood mingles with the triplets&#x27;. The priest then makes Danggeum-aegi the goddess of childbirth, and the triplets either the Jeseok gods or a group of equivalent fertility deities.

In the northern and eastern traditions, the &quot;Jeseok bon-puri&quot; is often linked to the creation narrative, with the usurper Seokga being the same god as the priest who impregnates Danggeum-aegi. According to Hong Tae-han, the &quot;Jeseok bon-puri&quot; was probably originally episodes in a longer narrative centering on the deeds of the creator god, as still seen today in the South Hamgyong &quot;Seng-gut&quot; narrative. The northern versions where the &quot;Jeseok bon-puri&quot; follows the creation narrative are thus the most archaic.

Despite the Buddhist veneer, the priest has many attributes of a sky god. In various versions, the priest is said to live in the palace of the heavens, or to ride into his home in the clouds on a paper horse, or to take Danggeum-aegi with him on a journey to heaven using a rainbow as a bridge. Many versions refer to the priest or his temple as &quot;Golden&quot; ( ), which may be a corruption of the archaic Middle Korean phrase &quot;han kem&quot; () &quot;the Great God.&quot; The myth is thus one in which an earthly woman is impregnated by a celestial male figure and gives birth to children who become the objects of worship. Scholars have noted parallels between the meeting of the girl and the priest and the meeting of Yuhwa and Haemosu in the Goguryeo founding myth, and between the triplets&#x27; quest to find their father and their subsequent attainment of divinity and Yuri&#x27;s quest to find Jumong and his subsequent coronation as king.

===&quot;Princess Bari&quot;===

The &quot;Princess Bari&quot; narrative is found in all regions except Jeju. Roughly one hundred versions of the myth have been transcribed by scholars as of 2016, and around half of those since 1997. As of 1998, all known versions were sung only during &quot;gut&quot; rituals held for the deceased. Princess Bari is therefore a goddess closely associated with funeral rites. Bari&#x27;s exact role varies according to the version, sometimes failing to become a deity at all, but she is usually identified as the patron goddess of shamans, the conductor of the souls of the dead, or the goddess of the Big Dipper.

Despite the large number of versions, most agree upon the basic story. The first major episode shared by almost all versions is the marriage of the king and queen. The queen gives birth to six consecutive daughters who are treated luxuriously. When she is pregnant a seventh time, the queen has an auspicious dream. The royal couple takes this as a sign that she is finally bearing a son and prepares the festivities. Unfortunately, the child is a girl. The disappointed king orders the daughter to be thrown away, dubbing her Bari, from Korean &quot;to throw away.&quot; In some versions, she must be abandoned two or three times because she is protected by animals the first and second times. The girl is then rescued by a figure such as the Buddha (who regrets upon seeing her that he cannot take a woman as his disciple), a mountain god, or a stork.

Once Bari has grown, one or both of her parents fall gravely ill. They learn that the disease can only be cured through medicinal water from the Western Heaven. In the majority of versions, the king and queen ask their six older daughters to go fetch the water, but all of them refuse. Desperate, the king and queen order Princess Bari to be found again. In other versions, the royal couple is told in a dream or a prophecy to find their daughter. In any case, Bari is brought to court. She agrees to go to the Western Heaven and departs, usually wearing the robes of a man.

The details of Bari&#x27;s quest differ according to the version. In one of the oldest recorded narratives, recited by a shaman from near Seoul in the 1930s, she meets the Buddha after having gone three thousand leagues. Seeing through her disguise and remarking that she is a woman, the Buddha asks if she can truly go another three thousand leagues. When Bari responds that she will keep going even if she is to die, he gives her a silk flower, which turns a vast ocean into land for her to cross. She then liberates hundreds of millions of dead souls who are imprisoned in a towering fortress of thorns and steel.

When Bari finally arrives at the site of the medicinal water, she finds it defended by a supernatural guardian (of varying nature) who also knows that she is a woman, and obliges her to work for him and bear him sons. Once this is done―she may give birth to as many as twelve sons, depending on the version―she is allowed to return with the medicinal water and the flowers of resurrection. When she returns, she finds that her parents (or parent) have already died and that their funerals are being held. She interrupts the funeral procession, opens the coffin lids, and resurrects her parents with the flowers and cures them with the water. In most versions, the princess then attains divinity.

Each of the four mainland regional traditions feature distinctive elements of the &quot;Princess Bari&quot;. The west-central tradition is marked by strong Buddhist influence. The rescuer is always the Buddha, who brings her to be raised by an old childless couple who are said to desire good &quot;karma&quot;. The East Coast and Gyeongsang tradition elaborates the most on Bari&#x27;s quest, and portrays the guardian of the medicinal water as an exiled god who must have sons in order to return to heaven. The Jeolla tradition is the least detailed, and does not mention Bari dressing as a man. There is great diversity within regions. For instance, the aforementioned 1930s version mentions a wood of resurrection, although most other versions, including other west-central ones, involve a flower.

The northern tradition is represented by only two versions, both from South Hamgyong, but feature remarkable differences. The princess does not reach the divine realm on her own, but through divine mercy. There, Bari steals the flowers of resurrection and flees. She suddenly dies at the end of the narrative without becoming a goddess, and the mother that she resurrected dies soon after. Her divine role in funerals as the link between the living world and the afterlife is replaced by the local goddess Cheongjeong-gaksi.

The &quot;Princess Bari&quot; has traditionally had an informal association with the royal court, and there is some evidence that its performance was patronized by King Jeongjo for the soul of his father, Prince Sado, who starved to death in a rice chest in 1762. According to modern Seoul shamans, an older version of the narrative had much jargon that was specific to the Korean court. Parallels to the Manchu folktale &quot;Tale of the Nishan Shaman&quot; have also been drawn.

===Localized mainland narratives===


The vast majority of mainland shamanic narratives are localized, being transmitted only in one or two specific regional traditions. South Hamgyong Province was particularly rich in these localized myths, with nine different narratives recited during the Mangmuk-gut funerary ritual alone. One of the most popular myths in South Hamgyong was the &quot;Song of Dorang-seonbi and Cheongjeong-gaksi&quot;. The myth centers on a woman named Cheongjeong-gaksi, who is devastated by the death of her husband Dorang-seonbi. The priest from the Golden Temple gives her a series of tasks in order to meet her husband again. This includes tearing out all her hair, twisting them into a rope, boring holes into her palms, and hanging from the rope in the middle of the air, with the rope passing through her palms, without screaming in pain; immersing her fingers in oil for three years, then praying while setting them on fire; and, finally, paving rough mountain roads with only what remains of her bare hands.

Despite succeeding in all this, she can only temporarily be reunited with Dorang-seonbi. In one version, the husband drowns in an accident the same day he is revived. As he dies, he tells his wife to commit suicide so that they can meet again. Cheongjeong-gaksi hangs herself and is united with her husband in the afterlife. Some time later, they both become gods. Dorang-seonbi and Cheongjeong-gaksi were the most important of the deities invoked in the Mangmuk-gut funeral, and were even worshipped in Buddhist temples as second only to the Buddha himself.

In a testimony to the diversity of Korean mythology, the localized narrative of the Visitors ( ), a group of wandering male and female smallpox gods most prominent in the East Coast-Gyeongsang tradition, covers entirely different themes from the tragic romance above. The narrative was traditionally performed to appease these dangerous deities during smallpox epidemics so they would inflict only light cases of the disease, and also to forestall potential epidemics. In a typical version performed in 1987, three of the Visitors, a group of male and female smallpox gods living in China, decide to visit Korea one day. The ferryman on the border demands that a female Visitor have sex with him to cross. The goddess immediately kills him and consecutively kills six of his seven children with smallpox. When his wife begs for mercy, she lets the youngest live as a blind, immobile hunchback.

In Seoul, the Visitors are chased away from the house of the wealthy Kim-jangja and lodge at the house of a poor crone. In return for her hospitality, the gods reward her and her granddaughter with great fortune. The crone also requests that the Visitors bless Cheolhyeon, Kim-jangja&#x27;s fifteen-year-old son who she used to nurse. But when Kim-jangja rejects the Visitors a second time, the female Visitor takes the form of Cheolhyeon&#x27;s mother in order to lure him away and gives him a severe case of smallpox. Kim-jangja vows to sacrifice a calf for the gods, only to refuse the sacrifice when the Visitors recall the illness in response. The outraged gods kill Cheolhyeon, who becomes the youngest Visitor. Later, the Visitors discover that Kim-jangja has been reduced to poverty and that he has no children left due to Cheolhyeon&#x27;s death. They take pity on him and give the 70-year-old Kim-jangja a new son.

===Jeju narratives===

The Jeju tradition has the richest mythology. Its corpus of shamanic narratives, called &quot;bon-puri&quot; (), is divided into three or four categories. The approximately dozen general &quot;bon-puri&quot; are known by all shamans, and involve deities with universal functions who are worshipped throughout the island. The village-shrine &quot;bon-puri&quot; feature the guardian gods of a specific village, and are known only by shamans from the relevant village and its neighbors. The ancestral &quot;bon-puri&quot; are about the patron gods of specific families or occupations; despite the name of the category, the god is often not perceived as an actual ancestor. They are known only by shamans from the family or occupation in question, and are thus poorly understood. Some analyses also include a small fourth category of &quot;special &quot;bon-puri&quot;,&quot; which are no longer ritually performed by shamans.

Many general &quot;bon-puri&quot; are clearly related to mainland narratives but have distinctive Jeju characteristics. A typical example is the &quot;Chogong bon-puri&quot;, the Jeju version of the &quot;Jeseok bon-puri&quot; but with a very different ritual function. The early part of the &quot;Chogong bon-puri&quot; is similar to &quot;Jeseok bon-puri&quot; versions from Jeolla, the closest part of the mainland. After being supernaturally impregnated, the teenage Noga-danpung-agassi (the Jeju equivalent of the mainland Danggeum-aegi) is expelled from home and goes in search for the priest. But in Jeju, the priest sends her away to give birth to the triplets alone. Unlike in Jeolla, but like in the northern and eastern traditions, the triplets grow up fatherless.

When they best three thousand Confucian scholars in the civil service examinations, the jealous scholars murder Noga-danpung-agassi. The triplets visit their father for help, and the priest makes them abandon their previous life and initiates them into shamanism. The triplets hold the first shamanic rituals to successfully resurrect their mother, then become divine judges of the dead in order to bring justice to the scholars in the afterlife. When asked about the origin of a ritual, Jeju shamans respond that &quot;it was done that way in the &quot;Chogong bon-puri&quot;.&quot;

Village-shrine &quot;bon-puri&quot; are dedicated to the patron gods of one or multiple villages. Most fit a formulaic structure. In their most complete form, a carnivorous hunting god emerges from the hills of Jeju and an agricultural goddess arrives from overseas, often China. The two marry and become village gods, but then separate, generally because the goddess cannot stand the god&#x27;s foul habits or the stench of his meat. The goddess then gives birth to a third god, who is expelled from the island and goes on adventures abroad before returning to settle as the god of a different village. Many villages have only parts of this structure, so that the &quot;bon-puri&quot; ends with the marriage or even involves only the emergence or arrival of the deity. Many Jeju village gods are also thought to be related to one another. Among the most important village &quot;bon-puri&quot; is thus the one dedicated to the gods of Songdang shrine, who are the parents or grandparents of 424 guardian gods of various villages and locations on the island.

===Mainland village-shrine myths===


As in Jeju, mainland Korean villages are traditionally associated with specific guardian deities. The Joseon dynasty strongly promoted Confucian-style worship for these gods over traditional shamanic practices. By the late nineteenth century, most important rituals for village gods were being held by men according to Confucian norms, complete with invocations in Chinese instead of Korean. The sacred stories associated with these gods are therefore not (or no longer) shamanic narratives, except in Jeju Island.

Nonetheless, many such stories reflect shamanic beliefs, such as the emphasis on appeasing sorrowful spirits. Like the shamanic narratives, village-shrine myths are closely associated with rituals dedicated to the god, often explaining the identity of the deity that is venerated. The village mythology is also a living one. For example, it is now believed in the village of Soya, in North Gyeongsang Province, that the local guardian god accurately predicted which soldiers from the village would survive World War II.

In a study of 94 village-shrine myths from South Jeolla Province, Pyo In-ju divides the myths into two major categories, depending on whether the god is identified as a natural object or a human spirit. The most prominent natural objects in the myths are trees, dragons, and rocks. In the village of Jangdong in Gwangyang, for example, a local tree is said to have wept one day during the 1592 Japanese invasion. While all the villagers crowded to the tree at this strange sound, the Japanese attacked. Finding the village abandoned, they suspected a trap and left. A few days later, the Japanese returned and attempted to cut down the tree, but the tree dropped giant branches on them and killed them all. The Japanese never dared approach the village afterwards. Ever since, locals have worshipped the tree as a god.

Village gods identified as the spirits of humans are often the founder of the village, or alternatively a sorrowful spirit (, ) which has remained in the human world after death because of their grief or resentment, for instance because they were murdered or because they died as a child.

==In popular culture==

The state-foundation myths have been adapted into several South Korean TV series, such as the popular 2006 series &quot;Jumong&quot;, but their potential in popular culture is limited due to the small size of the corpus and the lack of thematic diversity. In recent years, the larger and more diverse shamanic mythology has also appeared in South Korean culture beyond its ritual context. The shamanic narrative best known in South Korea is the &quot;Princess Bari&quot; in large part due to the work of feminists since the 1990s, who highlighted the myth&#x27;s characteristics as women&#x27;s literature. The goddess has since appeared in mediums as diverse as flash games to musicals. In 2007, Hwang Sok-yong—one of the country&#x27;s most important living novelists—published &quot;Bari-degi&quot;, a novel set in the modern day about a girl named Bari, whose life parallels the myth of her divine namesake. Other shamanic narratives have also recently entered popular culture, notably in the 2010s Webtoon &quot;Along with the Gods&quot;, which draws heavily on Jeju &quot;bon-puri&quot;. However, much of the shamanic mythology remains largely unknown to the South Korean public.

<text>The Korean Demilitarized Zone () is a heavily militarized strip of land running across the Korean Peninsula near the 38th parallel north. The demilitarized zone (DMZ) is a border barrier that divides the peninsula roughly in half. It was established to serve as a buffer zone between the sovereign states of the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea (North Korea) and the Republic of Korea (South Korea) under the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement in 1953, an agreement between North Korea, China, and the United Nations Command.

The DMZ is long and about wide. There have been various incidents in and around the DMZ, with military and civilian casualties on both sides. Within the DMZ is a meeting point between the two Korean states, where negotiations take place: the small Joint Security Area (JSA) near the western end of the zone.

==Location==

The Korean Demilitarized Zone intersects but does not follow the 38th parallel north, which was the border before the Korean War. It crosses the parallel on an angle, with the west end of the DMZ lying south of the parallel and the east end lying north of it.

The DMZ is long, approximately wide. Though the zone itself is demilitarized, the zone&#x27;s borders on both sides are some of the most heavily militarized borders in the world. The Northern Limit Line, or NLL, is the disputed maritime demarcation line between North and South Korea in the Yellow Sea, not agreed in the armistice. The coastline and islands on both sides of the NLL are also heavily militarized.

==History==

The 38th parallel north—which divides the Korean Peninsula roughly in half—was the original boundary between the United States and Soviet Union&#x27;s brief administration areas of Korea at the end of World War II. Upon the creation of the North Korea (formally the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea or DPRK) and South Korea (formally the Republic of Korea or ROK) in 1948, it became a &quot;de facto&quot; international border and one of the most tense fronts in the Cold War.

Both the North and the South remained dependent on their sponsor states from 1948 to the outbreak of the Korean War. That conflict, which claimed over three million lives and divided the Korean Peninsula along ideological lines, commenced on 25 June 1950, with a full-front DPRK invasion across the 38th parallel, and ended in 1953 after international intervention pushed the front of the war back to near the 38th parallel.

In the Armistice Agreement of 27 July 1953, the DMZ was created as each side agreed to move their troops back from the front line, creating a buffer zone wide. The Military Demarcation Line (MDL) goes through the center of the DMZ and indicates where the front was when the agreement was signed.

Owing to this theoretical stalemate, and genuine hostility between the North and the South, large numbers of troops are stationed along both sides of the line, each side guarding against potential aggression from the other side, even years after its establishment. The armistice agreement explains exactly how many military personnel and what kind of weapons are allowed in the DMZ. Soldiers from both sides may patrol inside the DMZ, but they may not cross the MDL. Sporadic outbreaks of violence in and around the border have killed over 500 South Korean soldiers, 50 American soldiers and 250 North Korean soldiers along the DMZ between 1953 and 1999.

Daeseong-dong (also written &quot;Tae Sung Dong&quot; and known as “Freedom Village”), in South Korea, and Kijŏng-dong (also known as the &quot;Peace Village&quot;), in North Korea, are the only settlements allowed by the armistice committee to remain within the boundaries of the DMZ. Residents of Tae Sung Dong are governed and protected by the United Nations Command and are generally required to spend at least 240 nights per year in the village to maintain their residency. In 2008, the village had a population of 218 people. The villagers of Tae Sung Dong are direct descendants of people who owned the land before the 1950–53 Korean War.

To continue to deter North Korean incursion, in 2014 the United States government exempted the Korean DMZ from its pledge to eliminate anti-personnel landmines. On 1 October 2018, however, a 20-day process began to remove landmines from both sides of the DMZ.

==Joint Security Area==
Inside the DMZ, near the western coast of the peninsula, Panmunjeom is the home of the Joint Security Area (JSA). Originally, it was the only connection between North and South Korea but that changed on 17 May 2007, when a Korail train went through the DMZ to the North on the new Donghae Bukbu Line built on the east coast of Korea. However, the resurrection of this line was short-lived, as it closed again in July 2008 following an incident in which a South Korean tourist was shot and killed.

The JSA is the location of the famous Bridge of No Return, over which prisoner exchanges have taken place. There are several buildings on both the north and the south side of the MDL, and there have been some built on top of it. All negotiations since 1953 have been held in the JSA, including statements of Korean solidarity, which have generally amounted to little except a slight decline of tensions.

Within the JSA are a number of buildings for joint meetings called Conference Rooms. The MDL goes through the conference rooms and down the middle of the conference tables where the North Koreans and the United Nations Command (primarily South Koreans and Americans) meet face to face.

Facing the Conference Row buildings are the North Korean &quot;Panmungak&quot; () and the South Korean Freedom House. In 1994, North Korea enlarged Panmungak by adding a third floor. In 1998, South Korea built a new Freedom House for its Red Cross staff and to possibly host reunions of families separated by the Korean War. The new building incorporated the old Freedom House Pagoda within its design.

Since 1953 there have been occasional confrontations and skirmishes within the JSA. The axe murder incident in August 1976 involved the attempted trimming of a tree which resulted in two deaths (Captain Arthur Bonifas and First Lieutenant Mark Barrett). Another incident occurred on 23 November 1984, when a Soviet tourist named Vasily Matuzok (sometimes spelled Matusak), who was part of an official trip to the JSA (hosted by the North), ran across the MDL shouting that he wanted to defect to the South. As many as 30 North Korean soldiers pursued him across the border, opening fire. 
Border guards on the South Korean side returned fire, eventually surrounding the North Koreans. One South Korean and three North Korean soldiers were killed in the action. Matuzok survived and was eventually resettled in the U.S.

In late 2009, South Korean forces in conjunction with the United Nations Command began renovation of its three guard posts and two checkpoint buildings within the JSA compound. Construction was designed to enlarge and modernize the structures. Work was undertaken a year after North Korea finished replacing four JSA guard posts on its side of the MDL. On 15 October, 2018, during the high-level talks in Panmunjeom, military officials of the rank of colonel from the two Koreas and Burke Hamilton, Secretary of the UNC Military Armistice Commission, announced measures to reduce conventional military threats, such as creating buffer zones along their land and sea boundaries and a no-fly zone above the border, removing 11 front-line guard posts by December, and demining sections of the Demilitarized Zone.

==Villages==

Both North and South Korea maintain &quot;peace villages&quot; in sight of each other&#x27;s side of the DMZ. In the South, Daeseong-dong is administered under the terms of the DMZ. Villagers are classed as South Korean citizens, but are exempt from paying tax and other civic requirements such as military service. In the North, Kijŏng-dong features a number of brightly painted, poured-concrete multi-story buildings and apartments with electric lighting. These features represented an unheard-of level of luxury for rural Koreans, North or South, in the 1950s. The town was oriented so that the bright blue roofs and white sides of the buildings would be the most distinguishing features when viewed from the border. However, based on scrutiny with modern telescopic lenses, it has been confirmed that the buildings are mere concrete shells lacking window glass or even interior rooms, with the building lights turned on and off at set times and the empty sidewalks swept by a skeleton crew of caretakers in an effort to preserve the illusion of activity.

===Flagpoles===

In the 1980s, the South Korean government built a flag pole in Daeseong-dong, which flies a South Korean flag weighing . The North Korean government responded by building the Panmunjeom flagpole in Kijŏng-dong, only west of the border with South Korea. It flies a flag of North Korea. In 2014, the Panmunjeom flagpole was the fourth tallest in the world, after the Jeddah Flagpole in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, at , the Dushanbe Flagpole in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, at and the pole at the National Flag Square in Baku, Azerbaijan, which is . It is currently the world&#x27;s seventh largest flagpole.

==DMZ-related incidents and incursions==

Since demarcation, the DMZ has had numerous cases of incidents and incursions by both sides, although the North Korean government typically never acknowledges direct responsibility for any of these incidents (there are exceptions, such as the axe incident). This was particularly intense during the Korean DMZ Conflict (1966–1969) when a series of skirmishes along the DMZ resulted in the deaths of 81 American, 299 South Korean and 397 North Korean soldiers. This included the Blue House Raid in 1968, an attempt to assassinate South Korea President Park Chung Hee at the Blue House.

In 1976, in now-declassified meeting minutes, U.S. deputy secretary of defense William Clements told U.S. secretary of state Henry Kissinger that there had been 200 raids or incursions into North Korea from the south, though not by the U.S. military. Details of only a few of these incursions have become public, including raids by South Korean forces in 1967 that had sabotaged about 50 North Korean facilities.

===Incursion tunnels===

Since 15 November 1974, South Korea has discovered four tunnels crossing the DMZ that had been dug by North Korea. The orientation of the blasting lines within each tunnel indicated they were dug by North Korea. North Korea claimed that the tunnels were for coal mining; no coal was found in the tunnels, which were dug through granite. Some of the tunnel walls were painted black to give the appearance of anthracite.

The tunnels are believed to have been planned as a military invasion route by North Korea. They run in a north–south direction and do not have branches. Following each discovery, engineering within the tunnels has become progressively more advanced. For example, the third tunnel sloped slightly upwards as it progressed southward, to prevent water stagnation. Today, visitors from the south may visit the second, third and fourth tunnels through guided tours.

====First tunnel====
The first of the tunnels was discovered on 15 November 1974, by a South Korean Army patrol, noticing steam rising from the ground. The initial discovery was met with automatic fire from North Korean soldiers. Five days later, during a subsequent exploration of this tunnel, US Navy Commander Robert M. Ballinger and ROK Marine Corps Major Kim Hah-chul were killed in the tunnel by a North Korean explosive device. The blast also wounded five Americans and one South Korean from the United Nations Command.

The tunnel, which was about , extended more than beyond the MDL into South Korea. The tunnel was reinforced with concrete slabs and had electric power and lighting. There were weapon storage areas and sleeping areas. A narrow-gauge railway with carts had also been installed. Estimates based on the tunnel&#x27;s size suggest it would have allowed considerable numbers of soldiers to pass through it.

====Second tunnel====
The second tunnel was discovered on 19 March 1975. It is of similar length to the first tunnel. It is located between below ground, but is larger than the first, approximately .

====Third tunnel====

The third tunnel was discovered on 17 October 1978. Unlike the previous two, the third tunnel was discovered following a tip from a North Korean defector. This tunnel is about long and about below ground. Foreign visitors touring the South Korean DMZ may view inside this tunnel using a sloped access shaft.

====Fourth tunnel====

A fourth tunnel was discovered on 3 March 1990, north of Haean town in the former Punchbowl battlefield. The tunnel&#x27;s dimensions are , and it is deep. The method of construction is almost identical in structure to the second and the third tunnels.

===Korean wall===

According to North Korea, between 1977 and 1979, the South Korean and United States authorities constructed a concrete wall along the DMZ. North Korea, however, began to propagate information about the wall after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, when the symbolism of a wall unjustly dividing a people became more apparent.

Various organizations, such as the North Korean tour guide company Korea Konsult, claimed a wall was dividing Korea, saying that:

In December 1999, Chu Chang-jun, North Korea&#x27;s ambassador to China, repeated claims that a &quot;wall&quot; divided Korea. He said the south side of the wall is packed with soil, which permits access to the top of the wall and makes it effectively invisible from the south side. He also claimed that it served as a bridgehead for any northward invasion.

The United States and South Korea deny the wall&#x27;s existence, although they do claim there are anti-tank barriers along some sections of the DMZ. Dutch journalist and filmmaker Peter Tetteroo also shot footage of a barrier in 2001 which his North Korean guides said was the Korean Wall.

A 2007 Reuters report revealed that there is no coast to coast wall located across the DMZ and that the pictures of a &quot;wall&quot; which have been used in North Korean propaganda have merely been pictures of concrete anti-tank barriers. While 800,000 landmines were being removed in 2018, it was shown that the Joint Security Area along the Korean border was guarded by standard barbed wire.

==North Korean side of the DMZ==

The North Korean side of the DMZ primarily serves to stop an invasion of North Korea from the south. Its other purpose is to ensure that North Korean citizens face significant difficulty in any effort to defect to South Korea.

From the armistice until 1972, approximately 7,700 South Korean soldiers and agents infiltrated into North Korea in order to sabotage military bases and industrial areas. Around 5,300 of them never returned home.

North Korea has thousands of artillery pieces near the DMZ. According to a 2018 article in &quot;The Economist&quot;, North Korea could bombard Seoul with over 10,000 rounds every minute. Experts believe that 60 percent of its total artillery is positioned within a few kilometers of the DMZ acting as a deterrent against any South Korean invasion.

==Propaganda==

===Loudspeaker installations===

From 1953 until 2004, both sides broadcast audio propaganda across the DMZ. Massive loudspeakers mounted on several of the buildings delivered DPRK propaganda broadcasts directed towards the south as well as propaganda radio broadcasts across the border. South Korean broadcasts featured &quot;popular music and lectures on freedom and democracy,&quot; while the North Korean broadcast featured &quot;martial music and praises to the country&#x27;s rulers.&quot; In 2004, the North and South agreed to end the broadcasts as part of an agreement to ease diplomatic tensions.

On 4 August 2015, a border incident occurred where two South Korean soldiers were wounded after stepping on landmines that had allegedly been laid on the southern side of the DMZ by North Korean forces near an ROK guard post. Both North Korea and South Korea then resumed broadcasting propaganda by loudspeaker. After four days of negotiations, on 25 August 2015 South Korea agreed to discontinue the broadcasts following a statement from North Korea&#x27;s government expressing regret for the landmine incident.

On 8 January 2016, in response to North Korea&#x27;s supposed successful testing of a hydrogen bomb, South Korea resumed broadcasts directed at the North. On 15 April 2016, it was reported that the South Koreans purchased a new audio system to combat the North&#x27;s broadcasts.

===Balloons===

Both North and South Korea have held balloon propaganda leaflet campaigns since the Korean War.

In recent years, mainly South Korean non-governmental organizations have been involved in launching balloons targeted at the DMZ and beyond. Due to the winds, the balloons tend to fall near the DMZ where there are mostly North Korean soldiers to see the leaflets. As with the loudspeakers, balloon operations were mutually agreed to be halted between 2004 and 2010. It has been assessed that the activists&#x27; balloons may contribute to the decay of remaining cooperation between the Korean governments, and the DMZ has become more militarized in recent years.

Many North Korean leaflets during the Cold War gave instructions and maps to help targeted South Korean soldiers in defecting. One of the leaflets found on the DMZ included a map of Cho Dae-hum&#x27;s route of defection to North Korea across the DMZ. In addition to using balloons as a means of delivery, North Koreans have also used rockets to send leaflets to the DMZ.

===Dismantling===
On 23 April 2018, both North and South Korea officially cancelled their border propaganda broadcasts. On 1 May 2018, the loudspeaker systems across the Korean border were dismantled. Both sides also committed to ending the balloon campaigns. On 5 May 2018, an attempt by North Korean defectors to disperse more balloon propaganda across the border from South Korea was halted by the South Korean government. The no-fly zone which was established on 1 November 2018 also designates a no-fly zone for all aircraft types above the MDL, and prohibits hot-air balloons from traveling within 25 km of the Korean border&#x27;s MDL.

In 2024, as a response to continuing leaflets from South Korean activists, the North flew around 1,000 balloons filled with cigarette butts, manure, waste batteries, scraps of cloth, and dirty diapers over the border. In response, South Korean activists released helium balloons with anti-Pyongyang leaflets and USB sticks with K-dramas and world news into North Korea. The actions of North Korea resulted in a June 2024 decision by the South to suspend the above deal and resume military drills near the border.

==Civilian Control Line==
The Civilian Control Line (CCL), or the Civilian Control Zone (CCZ, ), is a line that designates an additional buffer zone to the DMZ within a distance of from the Southern Limit Line of the DMZ. Its purpose is to limit and control the entrance of civilians into the area in order to protect and maintain the security of military facilities and operations near the DMZ. The commander of the 8th US Army ordered the creation of the CCL and it was activated and first became effective in February 1954.

The buffer zone that falls south of the Southern Limit Line is called the Civilian Control Zone. Barbed wire fences and manned military guard posts mark the Civilian Control Line. The Civilian Control Zone is necessary for the military to monitor civilian travel to tourist destinations close to the Southern Limit Line of the DMZ like the discovered infiltration tunnels and tourist observatories. Usually when traveling within the Civilian Control Zone, South Korean soldiers accompany tourist buses and cars as armed guards to monitor the civilians as well as to protect them from North Korean intruders.

Right after the ceasefire, the Civilian Control Zone outside the DMZ encompassed 100 or so empty villages. The government implemented migration measures to attract settlers into the area. As a result, in 1983, when the area delineated by the Civilian Control Line was at its largest, a total of 39,725 residents in 8,799 households were living in the 81 villages located within the Civilian Control Zone.

Most of the tourist and media photos of the &quot;DMZ fence&quot; are actually photos of the CCL fence. The actual DMZ fence on the Southern Limit Line is completely off-limits to everybody except soldiers, and it is illegal to take pictures of the DMZ fence. The CCL fence acts more as a deterrent for South Korean civilians from getting too close to the dangerous DMZ and is also the final barrier for North Korean infiltrators if they get past the Southern Limit Line DMZ fence.

==Neutral Zone of the Han River Estuary==
The whole estuary of the Han River is deemed a &quot;Neutral Zone&quot; and is off-limits to all civilian vessels and is treated like the rest of the DMZ. Only military vessels are allowed within this neutral zone.

According to the July 1953 Korean Armistice Agreement civil shipping was supposed to be permissible in the Han River estuary and allow Seoul to be connected to the Yellow Sea (West Sea) via the Han River. However, both Koreas and the UNC failed to make this happen. The South Korean government ordered the construction of the Ara Canal to finally connect Seoul to the Yellow Sea, which was completed in 2012. Seoul was effectively landlocked from the ocean until 2012. The biggest limitation of the Ara Canal is it is too narrow to handle any vessels except small tourist boats and recreational boats, so Seoul still cannot receive large commercial ships or passenger ships in its port.

In recent years Chinese fishing vessels have taken advantage of the tense situation in the Han River Estuary Neutral Zone and illegally fished in this area due to both North Korean and South Korean navies never patrolling this area due to the fear of naval battles breaking out. This has led to firefights and sinkings of boats between Chinese fishermen and South Korean Coast Guard.

On January 30, 2019, North Korean and South Korean military officials signed a landmark agreement that would open the Han River Estuary to civilian vessels for the first time since the Armistice Agreement in 1953. The agreement was scheduled to take place in April 2019 but the failure of the 2019 Hanoi Summit indefinitely postponed these plans.

==Castle of Gung Ye==
Within the DMZ itself, in the town of Cheorwon, is the old capital of the kingdom of Taebong (901–918), a regional upstart that became Goryeo, the dynasty that ruled a united Korea from 918 to 1392.

Taebong was founded by the charismatic leader Gung Ye, a brilliant if tyrannical one-eyed ex-Buddhist monk. Rebelling against the kingdom of Silla, Korea&#x27;s then ruling dynasty, he proclaimed the kingdom of Taebong—also called Later Goguryeo, in reference to the ancient kingdom of Goguryeo (37 BCE – 668 CE)—in 901, with himself as king. The kingdom consisted of much of central Korea, including areas around the DMZ. He placed his capital in Cheorwon, a mountainous region that was easily defensible (in the Korean War, this same region would earn the name &quot;the Iron Triangle&quot;).

As a former Buddhist monk, Gung Ye actively promoted the religion of Buddhism and incorporated Buddhist ceremonies into the new kingdom. Even after Gung Ye was dethroned by his own generals and replaced by Wang Geon, the man who would rule over a united Korea as the first king of Goryeo, this Buddhist influence would continue, playing a major role in shaping the culture of medieval Korea.

As the ruins of Gung Ye&#x27;s capital lie in the DMZ itself, visitors cannot see them. Moreover, excavation work and research have been hampered by political realities. In the future, inter-Korean peace may allow for proper archaeological studies to be conducted on the castle site and other historical sites within and underneath the DMZ.

The ruins of the capital city of Taebong, the ruins of the castle of Gung Ye, and Gung Ye&#x27;s tomb all lie within the DMZ and are off-limits to everybody except soldiers who patrol the DMZ.

==Transportation==
Panmunjeom is the site of the negotiations that ended the Korean War and is the main center of human activity in the DMZ. The village is located on the main highway and near a railroad connecting the two Koreas.

The railway, which connects Seoul and Pyongyang, was called the Gyeongui Line before division in the 1940s. Currently the South uses the original name, but the North refers to the route as the P&#x27;yŏngbu Line. The railway line has been mainly used to carry materials and South Korean workers to the Kaesong Industrial Region. Its reconnection was seen as part of the general improvement in the relations between North and South in the early part of this century. However, in November 2008 North Korean authorities closed the railway amid growing tensions with the South. Following the death of former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, conciliatory talks were held between South Korean officials and a North Korean delegation who attended Kim&#x27;s funeral. In September 2009, the Kaesong rail and road crossing was reopened.

The road at Panmunjeom, which was known historically as &quot;Highway One&quot; in the South, was originally the only access point between the two countries on the Korean Peninsula. Passage is comparable to the strict movements that occurred at Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin at the height of the Cold War. Both North and South Korea&#x27;s roads end in the JSA; the highways do not quite join as there is a concrete line that divides the entire site. People given the rare permission to cross this border must do so on foot before continuing their journey by road.

In 2007, on the east coast of Korea, the first train crossed the DMZ on the new Donghae Bukbu (Tonghae Pukpu) Line. The new rail crossing was built adjacent to the road which took South Koreans to Mount Kumgang Tourist Region, a region of significant cultural importance for all Koreans. More than one million civilian visitors crossed the DMZ until the route was closed following the shooting of a 53-year-old South Korean tourist in July 2008. After a joint investigation was rebuffed by North Korea, the South Korean government suspended tours to the resort. Since then, the resort and the Donghae Bukbu Line have effectively been closed by North Korea. Currently, the South Korean Korea Railroad Corporation (Korail) organizes tours to DMZ with special DMZ themed trains.

On 14 October 2018, North and South Korea, agreed to meet the summit&#x27;s goal of restoring railway and road transportation, which had been cut since the Korean War, by either late November or early December 2018. Road and railway transportation along the DMZ were reconnected in November 2018, following the removal of the &quot;frontline&quot; guard posts and Arrowhead Hill landmines, railroad transportation between North and South Korea resumed. The same day, 30 officials from both North and South Korea started an 18-day survey of a 400-kilometer (248-mile) railroad section in North Korea alongside the DMZ between Kaesong and Sinuiju. Efforts to conduct the survey had previously been obstructed due to the presence of the guard posts and the Arrowhead Hill landmines. The survey will then follow the groundbreaking of a new railroad along the DMZ. The railway survey which involved the Gyeongui Line concluded on 5 December 2018.

On 8 December 2018, a South Korean bus crossed the DMZ into North Korea. The same day, the officials who conducted the inter-Korean survey for the Gyeongui Line began surveying the Donghae Line.

==Nature reserve==
In the past 70 years, the Korean DMZ has been a deadly place for humans, making habitation impossible. Only around the former village of Panmunjom and more recently the Donghae Bukbu Line on Korea&#x27;s east coast have there been regular incursions by people.

This natural isolation along the length of the DMZ has created an involuntary park which is now recognized as one of the most well-preserved areas of temperate habitat in the world. In 1966 it was first proposed that the DMZ be turned into a national park.

There are over 6,000 species of animals and plants in the DMZ. The DMZ has over 100 endangered animal species of the 267 in Korea, as well as many endangered plant species, among the heavily fortified fences, landmines and listening posts. These animals include the endangered red-crowned crane (a staple of Asian art), the white-naped crane, critically endangered Korean fox and Asiatic black bear, and, potentially, the extremely rare Siberian tiger, Amur leopard, and endangered marine species such as western gray whale. Ecologists have identified some 2,900 plant species, 70 types of mammals and 320 kinds of birds within the narrow buffer zone. Additional surveys are now being conducted throughout the region.

The DMZ owes its varied biodiversity to its geography, which crosses mountains, prairies, swamps, lakes, and tidal marshes. Environmentalists hope that the DMZ will be conserved as a wildlife refuge, with a well-developed set of objective and management plans vetted and in place. In 2005, CNN founder and media mogul Ted Turner, on a visit to North Korea, said that he would financially support any plans to turn the DMZ into a peace park and a UN-protected World Heritage Site.

In September 2011, South Korea submitted a nomination form to Man and the Biosphere Programme (MAB) in UNESCO for designation of in the southern part of the DMZ below the Military Demarcation Line, as well as in privately controlled areas, as a Biosphere Reserve according to the Statutory Framework of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves. The MAB National Committee of the Republic of Korea mentioned only the southern part of DMZ to be nominated since there was no response from Pyongyang when it requested Pyongyang to push jointly. North Korea is a member nation of the international coordinating council of UNESCO&#x27;s Man and the Biosphere Programme, which designates Biosphere Reserves.

North Korea opposed the application as a violation of the armistice agreement during the council&#x27;s meeting in Paris on 9 to 13 July 2011. The South Korean government&#x27;s attempt to designate the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve was turned down at UNESCO&#x27;s MAB council meeting in Paris in July 2012. Pyongyang expressed its opposition by sending letters to 32 council member countries, except for South Korea, and the UNESCO headquarters a month prior to the meeting. At the council meeting, Pyongyang said the designation violated the Armistice Agreement.

==Destruction of guard posts==

On 26 October 2018, South Korean major general Kim Do-gyun and North Korean lieutenant general An Ik-san met in Tongilgak (the &quot;Unification Pavilion&quot;), a North Korean building located within the JSA. There, they began implementing new protocols which aim to reduce tension by requiring both North and South Korea to destroy 22 guard posts across the DMZ, among other steps. Both generals approved requirements for the guard posts to be destroyed by the end of November 2018. The JSA&#x27;s guard posts were destroyed on 25 October 2018. North and South Korea agreed to dismantle 11 guard posts located within their individual country and deemed as &quot;front-line&quot;. It was also agreed that after the posts are dismantled, both Koreas would also withdraw equipment and personnel stationed at each post as well. In tandem with the September 2018 Pyongyang and Military Domain Agreements, both sides also agreed to gradually remove all guard posts near the DMZ following verification in December 2018.

However, all remaining troops and equipment, including weapons, were withdrawn from all of the 22 &quot;frontline&quot; guard posts before destruction began and both Koreas later agreed to individually destroy 10 of these guard posts instead of 11.

On 4 November 2018, the North and South Korean governments hoisted a yellow flag above each of their 11 DMZ guard posts to publicly indicate that they all will be dismantled. On 10 November 2018, the withdrawal of military personnel and weapons from all of the DMZ&#x27;s 22 &quot;front-line&quot; guard posts was completed. The destruction of 20 guard posts officially began on 11 November 2018. However, both Koreas amended the original agreement and decided to preserve 2 of the 22 now demilitarized frontline guard posts. Both of the posts which were planned to be preserved are located on the opposite sides of the Korean border.

On 15 November 2018, destruction of two DMZ guard posts, one being located in South Korea and the other located in North Korea, was completed. Work was still ongoing to complete the destruction of other guard posts as well. On 23 November 2018, it was revealed that South Korea was slowly destroying their guard posts with excavators.

On 20 November 2018, North Korea, hoping to further ease tensions with South Korea, destroyed all of their 10 remaining &quot;frontline&quot; guard posts. The South Korean Defense Ministry released photos confirming this and also released a statement stating that North Korea had informed them about the plans to demolish them before it took place. This came in accordance with the earlier agreements. South Korea also released videos of the guard posts being destroyed as well.

On 30 November 2018, both Koreas completed work to dismantle 10 of their &quot;frontline&quot; guard posts. However, the later agreement for each Korea to preserve one &quot;frontline&quot; post was upheld as well. The &quot;frontline&quot; guard post which was preserved on the North Korean side of the DMZ was visited by Kim Jong-un in 2013 when tensions were rising between both Koreas.

==Establishment of buffer zones, no-fly zones and Yellow Sea peace zones==
On 1 November 2018, buffer zones were established across the DMZ by the North and South Korean militaries. In compliance with the Comprehensive Military Agreement which was signed at the September 2018 inter-Korean summit, the buffer zone helps ensure that both North and South Korea will effectively ban hostility on land, air, and sea. Both Koreas are prohibited from conducting live-fire artillery drills and regiment-level field maneuvering exercises or those by bigger units within 5 kilometers of the Military Demarcation Line (MDL). The buffer zones stretch from the north of Deokjeok Island to the south of Cho Island in the West Sea and the north of Sokcho city and south of Tongchon County in the East (Yellow) Sea.

No-fly zones have also been established along the DMZ to ban the operation of drones, helicopters and other aircraft over an area up to away from the MDL. For UAVs, within from the MDL in the East and from the MDL in the West. Hot-air balloons cannot travel within of the DMZ as well. For fixed-wing aircraft, no fly zones are designated within from the MDL in the East (between MDL Markers No. 0646 and 1292) and within of the MDL in the West (between MDL Markers No. 0001 and 0646). For rotary-wing aircraft, the no fly zones are designated within of the MDL.

Both Koreas also created &quot;peace zones&quot; near their disputed Yellow Sea border.

==Reconnecting of MDL-crossing road==
On 22 November 2018, North and South Korea completed construction to connect a road along the DMZ, northeast of Seoul. This road, which crosses the Korean MDL land border, consists of in South Korea and in North Korea. The road was reconnected for the first time in 14 years in an effort to assist with a process at the DMZ&#x27;s Arrowhead Hill involving the removal of landmines and exhumation of Korean War remains.

==Presence of landmines and Korean War remains==
On 1 October 2018, North and South Korean military engineers began a scheduled 20 day removal process of landmines and other explosives planted across the JSA. Work to remove landmines from the Joint Security Area was completed on 25 October 2018. Demining had begun at the DMZ&#x27;s Arrowhead Hill and resulted in the discovery of Korean War remains. Work between both Koreas to remove landmines from Arrowhead Hill was completed on 30 November 2018.

==Military Border Crossing==
On 12 December 2018, militaries from both Koreas crossed the DMZ&#x27;s MDL into the opposition countries for the first time in history to inspect and verify the removal of &quot;frontline&quot; guard posts.

==Meeting of Trump, Kim, and Moon at the DMZ==

On 30 June 2019, U.S. president Donald Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to enter North Korea, doing so at the DMZ line. After crossing into North Korea, Trump and North Korean chairman Kim Jong Un met and shook hands. Kim stated, in Korean, &quot;It&#x27;s good to see you again&quot;, &quot;I never expected to meet you at this place&quot; and &quot;you are the first U.S. president to cross the border.&quot; Both men then briefly crossed the border line before crossing back into South Korea.

On the South Korean side of the DMZ, Kim, South Korean president Moon Jae-in, and Trump held a brief chat before holding an hour-long meeting at the DMZ&#x27;s Inter-Korean House of Freedom.

==Pilgrimages==
An annual youth pilgrimage including a 6-day peace walk to the DMZ is organised by the Catholic Church. The first pilgrimage took place in 2012. Young people from 15 countries attended the 2019 pilgrimage. The 2022 pilgrimage included visits to the Ulleungdo and Dokdo islands.

<text>Rubén Blades Bellido de Luna (born July 16, 1948), known professionally as Rubén Blades (, ), is a Panamanian musician, singer, composer, actor, activist, and politician, performing musically most often in the salsa, and Latin jazz genres. As a songwriter, Blades brought the lyrical sophistication of Central American &quot;nueva canción&quot; and Cuban &quot;nueva trova&quot; as well as experimental tempos and politically inspired Son Cubano salsa to his music, creating &quot;thinking persons&#x27; (salsa) dance music&quot;. Blades has written dozens of hit songs, including &quot;Pedro Navaja&quot; and &quot;El Cantante&quot; (which became Héctor Lavoe&#x27;s signature song). He has won twelve Grammy Awards out of 20 nominations and twelve Latin Grammy Awards.

His acting career began in 1983, and has continued, sometimes with several-year breaks to focus on other projects. He has prominent roles in films such as &quot;Crossover Dreams&quot; (1985), &quot;The Milagro Beanfield War&quot; (1988), &quot;The Super&quot; (1991), &quot;Predator 2&quot; (1990), &quot;Color of Night&quot; (1994), &quot;Safe House&quot; (2012), &quot;The Counselor&quot; (2013) and &quot;Hands of Stone&quot; (2016), along with three Emmy Award nominations for his performances in &quot;The Josephine Baker Story&quot; (1991), &quot;Crazy from the Heart&quot; (1992) and &quot;The Maldonado Miracle&quot; (2003). He portrayed Daniel Salazar, a main character on the TV series &quot;Fear the Walking Dead&quot; (2015–2017; 2019–2023).

In 1994, Blades managed to attract 17% of the vote in a failed attempt to win the Panamanian presidency. In September 2004, he was appointed minister of tourism by Panamanian president Martín Torrijos for a five-year term.

He made his U.S. debut with the Pete Rodriguez orchestra in 1970 on his album &quot;De Panamá a New York&quot; and among his most successful albums are &quot;Rubén Blades y Son del Solar... Live!&quot;, &quot;Amor y Control&quot;, &quot;Caminando&quot;, SALSWING!, &quot;Son de Panamá&quot;, &quot;Tangos&quot;, &quot;Canciones del Solar de los Aburridos&quot;, &quot;Buscando América&quot;, &quot;El Que la Hace la Paga&quot;, &quot;Escenas&quot;, &quot;Salsa Big Band&quot;, &quot;Metiendo Mano!&quot; and his famous album &quot;Siembra&quot; released in 1978. In addition, he has collaborated with different artists such as Usher, Elvis Costello, as a soloist and as a guest Michael Jackson, Luis Miguel, Julio Iglesias, Ricky Martin, Juan Gabriel, Laura Pausini, Shakira, Thalía in the Spanish version of the song &quot;What More Can I Give&quot; written and translated by Blades as &quot;Todo Para Ti&quot;. He has also participated in several productions by different Latino artists such as &quot;Almost Like Praying&quot;, &quot;Color Esperanza 2020&quot;, &quot;Hoy Es Domingo&quot; among other tracks. He also translated into Spanish the track &quot;I Just Can&#x27;t Stop Loving You&quot; in the version called &quot;Todo Mi Amor eres Tu&quot; included in Jackson&#x27;s anniversary album &quot;Bad 25&quot;.

==Family history and early life==
Blades was born in Panama City, Panama. He is the son of Cuban musician and actress Anoland Díaz (her real surname is Bellido de Luna), and Colombian Rubén Darío Blades Sr., an athlete, a percussionist and a graduate of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics in Washington, D.C. His younger brother, Roberto Blades, is also a musician. His mother&#x27;s great-uncle, Juan Bellido de Luna, was active in the Cuban revolutionary movement against Spain and was a writer and publisher in New York City. Blades&#x27;s paternal grandfather, was thought to be Rubén Blades, an English-speaking native of St. Lucia who came to Panama as an accountant. However, in 2025 it was revealed on &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot; that Blades is actually the grandson of poet Ricardo Miró. Blades says that the man he thought was his grandfather had come to Panama to work on the Panama Canal, as he states in the song &quot;West Indian Man&quot; on the album &quot;Amor y Control&quot; (&quot;That&#x27;s where the Blades comes from&quot;) (1992). He explains the source and the pronunciation () of his family surname, which is of English origin, in his web show &quot;Show De Ruben Blades&quot; (SDRB). Additionally, on &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot; it was revealed that Amelia Denis de Icaza, the first Panamanian woman to publish her poems, was the aunt of Ricardo Miró, making her Blades&#x27;s great-aunt.

In Blades&#x27;s early days, he was a vocalist in Los Salvajes del Ritmo, and also a songwriter and guest singer with a popular Latin music conjunto (ensemble), Bush y sus Magníficos. His strongest influence of the day was the Joe Cuba sextet and Cheo Feliciano, whose singing style he copied to the point of imitating his voice tone and vocal range.

==Career==
===1970s–1980s===
Blades earned multiple degrees in political science and law at the Universidad Nacional de Panamá and performed legal work at the Bank of Panama as a law student.

Blades&#x27; first recording in the US was the solo album &quot;De Panamá a New York&quot;, with the Pete Rodriguez Orchestra, which included original compositions such as &quot;Juan Gonzalez&quot;, &quot;Descarga Caliente&quot; and &quot;De Panamá a New York&quot;, recorded in 1969 at The Sound Factory studio in California and released by New York City-based label Alegre Records in 1970. He then returned to Panamá and finished his degree.

In 1974, he moved to the United States, initially staying with his exiled parents in Miami, Florida, before moving to New York City where he began working in the mailroom at Fania Records. Soon Blades was working with salseros Ray Barretto and Larry Harlow. Shortly thereafter, Blades started collaborating with trombonist and bandleader Willie Colón. They recorded several albums together and participated in albums by plena singer Mon Rivera and the Fania All Stars.

Blades&#x27;s first notable hit was a song on the 1977 album &quot;Metiendo Mano&quot; that he had composed in 1968, &quot;Pablo Pueblo&quot;, a meditation about a working-class father who returns to his home after a long day at work. The song later became his unofficial campaign song when he ran for president of Panama. The Colón and Blades recording on the same album of Tite Curet Alonso&#x27;s composition, &quot;Plantación Adentro&quot;, which dealt with the brutal treatment of Indian natives in Latin America&#x27;s colonial times, was a hit in various Caribbean countries. He wrote and performed several songs with the Fania All Stars and as a guest on other artists&#x27; releases, including the hits &quot;Paula C&quot;, written about a girlfriend at the time; &quot;Juan Pachanga&quot;, about a party animal who buries his pain for a lost love in dance and drink; and &quot;Sin Tu Cariño&quot;, a love song, featuring a bomba break. The latter two songs feature piano solos by the Puerto Rican pianist Papo Lucca.

In 1978, Blades wrote the song &quot;El Cantante&quot;; Colón convinced him to give the song to Colón&#x27;s former musical partner, Héctor Lavoe, to record, since Lavoe&#x27;s nickname was already &quot;El Cantante de los Cantantes&quot; (&quot;the singer of singers&quot;). Lavoe recorded it that same year, and it became both a big hit and Lavoe&#x27;s signature song; a biographical film about Lavoe took the same title. (The film &quot;El Cantante&quot;, starring executive producer Marc Anthony and then wife Jennifer López, told a fictionalized version of this story, in which Blades tells Lavoe he wrote the song for him.)

The Colón and Blades album &quot;Siembra&quot; (1978) became the best-selling salsa record in history, with Blades writing all but one of the songs. It has sold over 3 million copies, and almost all of its songs were hits at one time or another in various Latin American countries. Its most famous song was &quot;Pedro Navaja&quot;, a song inspired by the 1928 song &quot;Mack the Knife&quot;; it tells the story of a neighborhood thug who is killed by a street walker who knows him (he stabs her, she shoots him, they both die, a bum finds them, and takes their belongings). The song inspired a 1980 Puerto Rican musical, &quot;La verdadera historia de Pedro Navaja&quot;, and a 1984 Mexican film, &quot;Pedro Navaja&quot;, neither of which had Blades&#x27; involvement. Blades wrote and sang a sequel song, &quot;Sorpresas&quot;, (surprises) on his 1985 album, &quot;Escenas&quot;, which revealed that Pedro had survived the incident and was still alive.

Blades became dissatisfied with Fania and tried to terminate his contract, but was legally obliged to record several more albums, released after his departure.

His 1981 song Tiburón (with Willie Colon) protested against military interventions by the United States (the metaphorical &quot;shark&quot; in the song&#x27;s title) in Latin America. It received little airplay in the US because of its controversial political message, with Blades being accused of sympathizing with communism and becoming particularly unpopular with the Cuban community in Miami. Blades would later state that &quot;I was out of the radio for fifteen years in [the US] because of &#x27;Tiburon&#x27;.&quot; Although he explicitly characterized &quot;Tiburón&quot; as &quot;an anti-imperialist song&quot;, he also sought to distance himself from radical Anti-Americanism among the Latin American Left. A 2016 study concluded that &quot;Regardless of his constant efforts not to be cornered ideologically [...] Blades always identified himself as a Panamanian and a Latin Americanist&quot;, inspired by Simón Bolívar.

In 1982 Blades got his first acting role, in &quot;The Last Fight&quot;, portraying a singer-turned-boxer vying for a championship against a fighter who was played by real-life world-champion boxer Salvador Sánchez. In 1984, he released &quot;Buscando América&quot;, and in 1985, Blades gained widespread recognition as co-writer and star of the independent film &quot;Crossover Dreams&quot; as a New York salsa singer willing to do anything to break into the mainstream. Blades also began his career in films scoring music for soundtracks. Also in 1985, he earned a master&#x27;s degree in international law from Harvard Law School. He was the subject of Robert Mugge&#x27;s documentary &quot;The Return of Rubén Blades&quot;, which debuted at that year&#x27;s Denver Film Festival. He also recorded a segment for the &quot;60 Minutes&quot; television program, interviewed by Morley Safer.

In 1984, Blades left Fania, and signed with Elektra, although Fania continued to release recordings compiled from their archives for some years afterwards. Blades assembled a band (known variously as Seis del Solar or Son del Solar) and began touring and recording with them. His first album with them, &quot;Escenas&quot;, included a duet with Linda Ronstadt (1985), won Blades his first Grammy Award, for Best Tropical Latin Album. He then recorded the album &quot;Agua de Luna&quot;, based on the short stories of writer Gabriel García Márquez, in 1987. The next year he released the English-language collaboration &quot;Nothing But the Truth&quot;, with rock artists Sting, Elvis Costello, and Lou Reed whose song &quot;The Hit&quot; aka its main chorus &quot;Don&#x27;t Double Cross the Ones You Love&quot;, appeared in the opening and closing credits of Sidney Lumet&#x27;s 1990 crime drama film &quot;Q &amp; A&quot;; also in 1988 he released the more traditionally salsa &quot;Antecedente&quot;, again with Seis del Solar, which again won a Grammy Award.

===1990s–2000s===
During the 1990s, he acted in films and continued to make records with Seis/Son del Solar. In 1990, he released the collection &quot;Poetry: the Greatest Hits&quot; that according to Q Magazine &quot;highlighted his political commentary and pastiche approach to music&quot;.

In 1994, he mounted an unsuccessful Panamanian presidential bid, founding a center-left party called Movimiento Papa Egoró (whose name comes from the Emberá language and means &quot;Mother Earth&quot;). The album that followed this experience was titled &quot;La Rosa de los Vientos&quot;. He also made award-winning music such as Pena and Amor y Control, won the 1997 Grammy for Best Tropical Latin Performance, and all its songs were by Panamanian songwriters, recorded using all Panamanian musicians. In 1996, Blades along with Son Miserables performed &quot;No Te Miento (I Am Not Lying [to you])&quot; for the AIDS benefit album &quot;Silencio=Muerte: Red Hot + Latin&quot; produced by the Red Hot Organization. In 1997, Blades headed the cast of singer/songwriter Paul Simon&#x27;s first Broadway musical, &quot;The Capeman&quot;, based on a true story about a violent youth who becomes a poet in prison, which also starred Marc Anthony and Ednita Nazario. His many film appearances include &quot;The Milagro Beanfield War&quot; (1988), &quot;The Two Jakes&quot; (1990), &quot;Predator 2&quot; (1990), &quot;Mo&#x27; Better Blues&quot; (1990), &quot;Color of Night&quot; (1994), and &quot;Devil&#x27;s Own&quot; (1997). He also guest-starred in an amusing episode of &quot;The X Files&quot; titled, &quot;El Mundo Gira&quot; (&quot;As The World Turns&quot;). He played immigration agent (la migra), Conrad Lozano, who works with Mulder and Scully to solve unexplained murders involving both rural California migrant workers and the Mexican folklore of El Chupacabra. In 1999, he played Mexican artist Diego Rivera in Tim Robbins&#x27; &quot;Cradle Will Rock&quot;. In the 2003 film &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot;, starring Johnny Depp, Antonio Banderas, and Willem Dafoe, he played the role of a retired FBI agent.

Blades&#x27;s 1999 album &quot;Tiempos&quot;, which he recorded with musicians from the Costa Rican groups Editus and Sexteto de Jazz Latino, represented a break from his salsa past and a further rejection of commercial trends in Latin music. Ironically, the album won a Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album. Blades was inducted into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame in 2001. Even more eclectic was the 2002 album &quot;Mundo&quot; with the 11-member Editus Ensemble and bagpiper Eric Rigler, which incorporated instruments from around the world. &quot;Mundo&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best World Music Album, and was also nominated for a Latin Grammy Award for Album of the Year. The same year, Blades guested on world music artist Derek Trucks&#x27; album, &quot;Joyful Noise&quot;. In 2003 he followed &quot;Mundo&quot; with a web site free-download project. Blades was presented with the Founders Award at the 2005 ASCAP Latin Awards. In 2004, he put his artistic career on hold when he began serving a five-year appointment as Panama&#x27;s minister of tourism. Beginning in June 2007, however, Blades turned some of his attention back to his artistic career, presenting an online TV show titled &quot;Show de Ruben Blades (SDRB)&quot; on his website.

In November 2005 he received an honorary degree from the Berklee College of Music.

In May 2007, Blades was sued by his former bandmate Willie Colón for breach of contract. This led to a series of suits and countersuits that lasted over five years, resulting in decisions in Blades&#x27; favor. In the middle of 2008 he took a leave of absence for a mini-tour in Europe, backed by the Costa Rican band Son de Tikizia. When his government service was completed in June 2009, he reunited the members of Seis del Solar for the 25th anniversary of &quot;Buscando América&quot; in a tour of the Americas.

===2010–present===

In June 2011, Blades was given the Harry Chapin Humanitarian Award by ASCAP and WhyHunger.

In 2014, Blades was the closing act for the Festival Internacional Cervantino in Mexico.

In 2015, Blades&#x27; album &quot;Tangos&quot; won a Grammy award for Best Latin Pop Album.

Blades expressed his interest in making another run for president of Panama in 2019.

In 2015, Blades was cast in the regular role of Daniel Salazar in the AMC post-apocalyptic drama &quot;Fear the Walking Dead&quot;, a companion series to &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;. Blades first appears in the second episode &quot;So Close, Yet So Far&quot;.

In 2017, Blades performed as one of the featured artists for Puerto Rico in Lin-Manuel Miranda&#x27;s charity single &quot;Almost Like Praying&quot; to raise money for victims of Hurricane Maria.

In September 2018, Blades was appointed as NYU Steinhardt Dean&#x27;s Inaugural Scholar-in-Residence at New York University.

In 2021, Blades was honored as the Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year for his contributions to Latin music and activism.

In 2024, Blades received the Doctor of Music honorary degree at Princeton University in New Jersey, USA.

Lincoln Center in NYC named Blades its Visionary Artist for the 2024-2025 season.

In 2025, it was discovered on &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot; that Blades is the newly discovered grandson of poet Ricardo Miró.

<doc id="328888" wikidata="Q6714932" url="?curid=328888" title="MCM/70">
<text>The MCM/70 is a pioneering microcomputer first built in 1973 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and released the next year. This makes it one of the first microcomputers in the world, the second to be shipped in completed form, and the first portable computer. The MCM/70 was the product of Micro Computer Machines, one of three related companies set up in Toronto in 1971 by Mers Kutt. It is considered by some historians to be the first usable personal microcomputer system.

==Early history==
Kutt, a professor of mathematics at Queen&#x27;s University in Kingston, Ontario during the late 1960s, noted that the efficiency of computer users there was hampered by the long wait times involved in submitting programs in punched card form for batch processing by a shared mainframe computer. In 1968, Kutt and Donald Pamenter started a firm, Consolidated Computer Inc., and began to produce a data-entry device named &quot;Key-Edit&quot;. This was a low-cost terminal, with a one-line display device, which bypassed the need for keypunching.

In 1971, Kutt, no longer part of CCI, began planning a machine to support software development in the recently developed programming language APL. APL was best programmed using a custom keyboard and these were very rare at the time. He initially named his design the &quot;Key-Cassette&quot;; similar in design and concept to Key-Edit, it would offer editing ability and support for either two cassette decks or one cassette and an acoustic coupler to upload programs to other machines.
The original design resembled a desktop electronic calculator. Kutt&#x27;s notes of the era showed his intent to use the cover and display from an extant calculator with a modified power supply, to include a small keyboard with 32 keys, and a display made of either 13 or 15 segmented LEDs. Kutt also created a company, Micro Computer Machines, which would later manufacture the devices.

==Development==
Through his acquaintance with Intel founder Robert Noyce, Kutt had been following Intel&#x27;s work on the 1201, an 8-bit microprocessor later renamed the Intel 8008. The processor was scheduled to be complete in late 1971, but its release was delayed until spring. In December 1971, Kutt incorporated a technology development company, Kutt Systems. He signed an agreement with Intel to supply an Intel 4004, a SIM4- 01 development system, supporting chips from the MCS-4 chipset, and an MP7-01 EPROM programmer to his new company. This equipment was used for early development work until the 8008 was available.

Kutt hired programmer Gord Ramer, and the two began work on developing Kutt&#x27;s concept. In May 1972, Kutt Systems received one of the earliest SIM8-01 kits. The team, now including hardware engineer José Laraya, software engineer André Arpin, and two APL programmers, Don Genner and Morgan Smyth, started to build what was then termed the &quot;M/C&quot;, for &quot;microcomputer&quot;. By then, the design had expanded to include a complete keyboard, a &quot;chiclet&quot; design similar to the ones used on early models of the Commodore PET, and a Burroughs Self-Scan 32-character display. Unlike the earlier &quot;Key-Edit&quot; system, the M/C would allow entering and executing APL programs.

Dissatisfied with the SIM8 equipment, the Kutt Systems staff built a motherboard from scratch, including an Omniport, an 8008-expansion bus. Meanwhile, work on porting an APL interpreter to the system continued, using an 8008 emulator written in Fortran named &quot;INTERP/8&quot;. The system, mocked up in breadboard form, was first displayed publicly on 11 November 1972 at the Kutt offices in Kingston, Ontario. In May 1973, the same system was shown at the APL Users’ Conference in Toronto, now encased in fibreglass. The completed design, in its new injection moulded case, was demonstrated for the press on 25 September 1973.

==Specifications==
The MCM/70, manufactured by Micro Computer Machines in Kingston, was encased in a wedge-shaped metal box about half a metre on a side, with a keyboard at the front, a compact audio cassette tape recorder(s) in the middle, and a one-line plasma display at the top. The MCM/70 had a one-line display and alphanumeric keyboard, and optionally had a second tape drive. It resembled desktop calculators of the time, such as HP 9830A.

An APL interpreter was built into the read-only memory (ROM), and the machine included a battery which allowed it time to save the &quot;workspace&quot; automatically when it was turned off. The MCM/70 weighed 20 pounds (9 kg) and shipped with up to 8 kilobytes of RAM and zero, one, or two cassette drives.

==Release==
The first complete systems were shipped to dealers in the autumn of 1974. The basic unit, model 720 with an 800 kHz 8008, 2 KB RAM and no cassette drive sold for $4,950 Canadian (at the time the dollar was about equal to the US dollar). The fully equipped model 782 with 8 KB and two drives was $9,800, and was the only model that sold well.

At the time, the machine was already officially being called a &quot;personal computer&quot;. The first manuals contain a personal note from Kutt to future customers, &quot;But the simplicity of the MCM/70 and its associated computer language…make personal computer use and ownership a reality… Enjoy the privilege of having your own personal computer.&quot;

The MCM/70 was sold mainly to companies and government institutions with the need to make complex calculations and mathematical analysis. MCM&#x27;s customers ranged from hospitals and insurance companies to NASA and the United States Army.

==Later development==
In 1975, the computer was rereleased with no changes as the MCM/700. Also released that year were a punched card reader, plotter, and several programs. The MCM/800 followed in 1976. It was faster, included 16 KB RAM, and included the ability to drive an external monitor. Virtual memory was supported on all of the machines, although using cassettes for storage made it slow.

Released in 1978, MCM/900 was faster yet, included 24 KB RAM, and an included a monitor. The MCM/1000, also called the MCM Power was a repackaged /900, and was later repackaged again as the MCM MicroPower. The bigger change for the /900 and /1000 was to support the HDS-10 disk server, which included an 8.4 MB 8-inch Shugart hard drive, an 8-inch floppy disk drive, and a 64 k Zilog Z80 to control it. Up to eight /900s or /1000s could be plugged into the HDS-10.

==Demise and legacy==
By the late 1970s, after selling several hundred units, MCM was facing competition from several home computer systems with the same computing power as their own machines. Although they were designing another more advanced microcomputer, termed &quot;A*2&quot;, the funding needed for rapid development was unavailable. By 1983, the firm had ceased operating.

Rights to the in-progress A*2 design were sold to Ampex. They worked on the design for about a year before also ceasing development. This machine, called &quot;Sysmo&quot;, was sold in France by Sysmo company from 1975. This start-up was funded in Paris by Michel Carlier, an engineer who had invested also in MCM, with his own capital. However, the machine was sold for management applications while it was programmed with a complex scientific language (APL) much better adapted to scientific and technical fields; Sysmo company filed for bankruptcy in 1978. The stock of MCM/Sysmo was bought by French company Generale d&#x27;Electricite (later Alcatel) for its own use because of the product&#x27;s mathematical computing features.

In 2011, York University professor Zbigniew Stachniak published a book about the development of the MCM/70, titled &quot;Inventing the PC: The MCM/70 Story&quot;. A collection of papers, illustrations and hardware related to the device have been included in the York University Computer Museum.

<doc id="328905" wikidata="Q271457" url="?curid=328905" title="Aleksandr I. Kuprin">
<text>Aleksandr Ivanovich Kuprin (;  – 25 August 1938) was a Russian writer best known for his novels &quot;The Duel&quot; (1905) and &quot;&quot; (1915), as well as &quot;Moloch&quot; (1896), &quot;Olesya&quot; (1898), &quot;Captain Ribnikov&quot; (1906), &quot;Emerald&quot; (1907), and &quot;The Garnet Bracelet&quot; (1911) – the latter made into a 1965 movie.

==Early life==
Aleksandr Kuprin was born 1870 in Narovchat, Penza, to Ivan Ivanovich Kuprin, a government official in Penza Governorate. and Liubov Alekseyevna Kuprina, Kulunchakova. His father was Russian, his mother belonged to a noble Volga Tatar family who had lost most of their wealth during the 19th century. Aleksandr had two older sisters, Sofia (1861–1922) and Zinaida (1863–1934).

In 1871 his father, aged 37, died of cholera. Three years later Aleksandr&#x27;s mother moved, with young Aleksandr, into the Widows&#x27; Home in Kudrino, Moscow, a period reflected in his tale &quot;A White Lie&quot; (1914). In 1876 he entered the Razumovsky boarding school, the source of what he later referred to as &#x27;childhood grievances&#x27;, but also an environment which nourished his riotous nature and in which he found himself popular among peers as storyteller.

=== Cadet Corps: 1883–1887 ===
In 1880, inspired by Russia&#x27;s victory in the Russo-Turkish War, Kuprin was enrolled into the Second Moscow Military High School, and turned over to the Cadet Corps in 1882. Several of Kuprin&#x27;s autobiographical stories, like &quot;At the Turning Point&quot; (1900), &quot;The River of Life&quot; (1906) and &quot;Lenochka&quot; (1910), refer to this period. &quot;The memory of the birching at the Cadet Corps stayed with me for the rest of my life,&quot; he wrote not long before his death. Yet it was there that he develop an interest in literature and started to write poetry. 

Most of Kuprun&#x27;s thirty youthful poems date from 1883 to 1887, the four years when he was in the Cadet Corps. Kuprin also made several translations of foreign verse (including Béranger&#x27;s &quot;Les Hirondelles&quot; and Heine&#x27;s &quot;Lorelei&quot;). His early political awareness found expression in these works; according to the scholar Nicholas Luker, &quot;perhaps the most interesting of Kuprin&#x27;s early poems is the political piece &quot;Dreams&quot;, written on 14 April 1887, the day before sentence was passed on the terrorists who had plotted to assassinate Alexander III in March of that year.&quot; Kuprin was 17 years of age at that date.

=== 46th Dnieper Infantry Regiment: 1888–1894 ===
In the autumn of 1888, Kuprin left the Cadet Corps to enter the Alexander Military Academy in Moscow. In the summer of 1890, he graduated from the Academy ranked sublieutenant and was posted to the 46th Dnieper Infantry Regiment (which he chose at random) stationed in Proskurov (now Khmelnitsky), where he spent the next four years.

== Literary career ==

In 1889 Aleksandr Kuprin met Liodor Palmin, an established poet who arranged for the publication in the &quot;Russian Satirical Leaflet&quot; of Kuprin&#x27;s debut short story &quot;The Last Debut&quot;, based on a real life incident, the 1881 suicide by poisoning on stage of the singer Yevlalya Kadmina, a scandalous tragedy which had also inspired Ivan Turgenev&#x27;s tale &quot;Clara Milich&quot;. 

Three years would pass between the appearance of &quot;The Last Debut&quot; and Kuprin&#x27;s second publication &quot;Psyche&quot; in December 1892. Like &quot;On a Moonlit Night&quot; which followed, &quot;Psyche&quot; showed the aberrations of a deranged mind, investigating the thin line between fantasy and reality.

Kuprin&#x27;s years of military service saw the publication of a short novel &quot;In the Dark&quot; (1893) and several short stories, mostly the artful studies of abnormal states of mind (&quot;A Slav Soul&quot;, &quot;Madness&quot; and &quot;The Forgotten Kiss&quot;, all 1894). Only &quot;The Inquiry&quot; (1894), his first publication to arouse critical comment, was concerned with the army, starting a series of Russian army-themed short stories: &quot;A Place to Sleep&quot; (1897), &quot;The Night-shift&quot; (1899), &quot;Praporshchik&quot; (1897), and &quot;The Mission&quot; (1901) which finally resulted in his most famous work, &quot;The Duel&quot;. 

Aside from his personal dissatisfaction with army life, the publication of &quot;The Inquiry&quot; was probably the major reason for Kuprin&#x27;s resignation, in the summer of 1894. &quot;There can be no doubt that the appearance of such a work, written by an officer and signed with his full name, would have had unpleasant consequences for him,&quot; Luker argues.

After retiring from the service, without any definite plans for the future, or &quot;any knowledge, academic or practical&quot; (according to &quot;Autobiography&quot;), Kuprin embarked upon a five-year-long trip through the South-West of the Russian Empire. He tried many types of job, including dental care, land surveying, acting, being a circus performer, psalm singer, doctor, hunter, fisher, etc., each of these subsequently reflected in his fictional work. All the while he was engaged in self-education and reading. Gleb Uspensky, with his sketches, became his favorite author.

In summer 1894 Kuprin arrived in Kyiv and by September had begun working for local newspapers &quot;Kyivskoe Slovo&quot; (Kyiv Word), &quot;Zhizn i Iskusstvo&quot; (Life and Art), and later &quot;Kievlianin&quot;. The qualities necessary for a good journalist, he believed, were &quot;mad courage, audacity, breadth of view, and amazing memory,&quot; gifts he considered himself to possess in full measure. While on frequent journeys to Russia&#x27;s Southwest he contributed to newspapers in Novocherkassk, Rostov-on-Don, Tsaritsyn, Taganrog, and Odessa.

In 1896 &quot;Russkoye Bogatstvo&quot; published &quot;Moloch&quot;, Kuprin&#x27;s first major work, a critique of the rapidly growing Russian capitalism and a reflection of the growing industrial unrest in the country. Since then only twice did he briefly returned to the theme, in &quot;A Muddle&quot; (1897) and &quot;In the Bowels of the Earth&quot; (1899). &quot;On this basis one is tempted to conclude that his concern for the industrial worker in &quot;Moloch&quot; was little more than a passing phase,&quot; Luker opines.

Alongside feuilletons and chronicles, Kuprin wrote small sketches investigating particular environments, or portraying people of specific occupations or circumstances, later gathered into a collection. March 1896 saw the publication of eight such sketches in a small edition entitled &quot;Kyiv Types&quot;, Kuprin&#x27;s first book. In October 1897 his second collection, &quot;Miniatures&quot;, came out, with one of his best known circus stories, &quot;Allez!&quot;, earning high praise from Leo Tolstoy. In 1905 Kuprin described &quot;Miniatures&quot; as his &quot;first childish steps along the road of literature&quot;. &quot;Miniatures&quot;, as well as his &quot;Industrial Sketches&quot;, made in 1896–1899 after his visit to the Donbas region, definitely marked a further stage in his maturing as a writer.

In 1897 Kuprin traveled to Volhynia to work as an estate manager, then went to the Polesye area in Southern Belorussia, where he helped to grow makhorka. &quot;There I absorbed my most vigorous, noble, extensive, and fruitful impressions... and came to know the Russian language and landscape,&quot; he remembered in 1920. Three stories of his unfinished &quot;Polesye Cycle&quot; – &quot;The Backwoods&quot;, his much acclaimed love piece &quot;Olesya&quot;, and &quot;The Werewolf&quot; (a horror story) – were published between 1898 and 1901. &quot;Moloch&quot; and &quot;Olesya&quot; did much to help Kuprin build his literary reputation. In September 1901 Viktor Mirolyubov, the editor of &quot;Zhurnal Dlya Vsekh&quot;, invited Kuprin to join this popular Petersburg monthly, and in December he moved to the capital.

=== Saint Petersburg: 1901–1904 ===
In Petersburg Kuprin found himself in the center of Russian cultural life. He became friends with Anton Chekhov, whom he regularly corresponded with up until the latter&#x27;s death in 1904, often seeking his advice. Kuprin&#x27;s friendship with Ivan Bunin would last almost forty years, continuing in emigration. Another important figure for Kuprin was the scholar and critic Fyodor Batyushkov of &quot;Mir Bozhiy&quot;. The 150 letters that are extant represent a minor part of their vast correspondence. Later Kuprin expressed much gratitude to Viktor Mirolyubov, who, as well as Maxim Gorky, exerted strong influence upon his career.

In 1901 Kuprin joined the Moscow Sreda (Wednesday) literary society, which was founded in 1899 by Nikolay Teleshov, and united mostly the young realist writers, among whom were Gorky, Bunin, and Leonid Andreyev. In February 1902 Kuprin married Maria Karlovna Davydova, the adopted daughter of Alexandra Davydova, the editor of &quot;Mir Bozhy&quot;. The latter died that same year. Maria Karlovna took over the publication; and soon Kuprin left &quot;Zhurnal Dlya Vsekh&quot;, to head the fiction section of the magazine that his wife was now editing.

In February 1903 the Gorky-founded Znanye (Knowledge) published the collection of eight tales by Kuprin, among them &quot;The Enquiry&quot; and &quot;Moloch&quot;. Leo Tolstoy praised the collection for its vivid language; and critics were almost unanimous in their approbation, pointing to Kuprin&#x27;s closeness in themes and technique to Chekhov and Gorky. Angel Bogdanovich of &quot;Mir Bozhy&quot; (who in 1897 had written unflatteringly of &quot;Moloch&quot;) now praised Kuprin&#x27;s compact style and his ability to convey a feeling of effervescent joie de vivre. Gorky himself, writing to Teleshov in March 1903, ranked Kuprin a third Russian author, next to Chekhov and Andreyev.

Despite his literary success, Kuprin&#x27;s first years in Petersburg were stressful. His employment with the magazine left him little time for his own writing; and when his work did appear in &quot;Mir Bozhy&quot;, rumor had it that he owed his success to his family connections. &quot;Life is hard: scandal, gossip, envy, hatred ... I feel very lonely and sad,&quot; he confessed to one of his Kyiv friends in a letter.

Kuprin wrote less between 1902 and 1905 than he had in the provinces; but, according to Luker, &quot;if the quantity of his writing was reduced – some twenty tales in all – its quality was incomparably higher... More conscious now of the blatant contrasts prevalent in Russian society, he turned his attention to the plight of the &#x27;little man&#x27; - thus following the best traditions of Russian literature.&quot; Among the noticeable stories were &quot;At the Circus&quot; (1902) praised by Chekhov and Tolstoy, &quot;The Swamp&quot; (1902), linked thematically with the Polesye cycle, and &quot;The Jewess&quot; (1904), demonstrating Kuprin&#x27;s profound sympathy for this persecuted minority in Russian society at a time when pogroms were regular occurrences in the Russian South West. Other themes of Kuprin&#x27;s prose of this period include hypocrisy (&quot;A Quiet Life&quot;, 1904; &quot;Good Company&quot;, 1905), bigotry (&quot;Measles&quot;, 1904), and the degeneration of the idle class (&quot;The High Priest&quot;, 1905).

=== &quot;The Duel&quot; (1905) ===
In 1904 Kuprin started working on &quot;The Duel&quot;. This novel, conceived in his second year in the army, and commenting on the &quot;horror and tedium of army life,&quot; was published on 3 May 1905. The creation of this novel was a cathartic experience for Kuprin. &quot;I must free myself from the heavy burden of impressions accumulated by my years of military service. I will call this novel The Duel, because it will be my duel ... with the tsarist army. The army cripples the soul, destroys all a man&#x27;s finest impulses, and debases human dignity... I have to write about all I have known and seen. And with my novel I shall challenge the tsarist army to a duel,&quot; he informed his wife in a letter.

&quot;The Duel&quot; became the literary sensation of the year in Russia. In 1905 some 45.5 thousand copies were sold, a vast number for the early 1900s. The controversy this novel caused continued until 1917. Critics on the left welcomed &quot;The Duel&quot; as &quot;another nail in the coffin of autocracy,&quot; while their conservative counterparts condemned it as a &quot;perfidious assault on the ruling order.&quot; One officer even challenged Kuprin to a duel through a Petersburg paper, while a group of twenty officers sent Kuprin a letter in 1905, expressing their gratitude. &quot;The Duel&quot;, according to Luker, marked &quot;the summit of Kuprin&#x27;s career... assuring him immortality in the annals of Russian literature.&quot; The first edition in English, translated by W. F. Harvey, was published in London in 1907.

====1905 Revolution &amp; aftermath: 1905–1913====
After the 1905 Revolution Kuprin became openly critical of the regime. He established links with sailors of the Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol, and even attempted to enlist on the battleship &quot;Potemkin&quot;, which mutinied in June 1905. Regarded as politically unreliable, he was put under secret police surveillance. In &quot;Events in Sevastopol&quot; he described the destruction of the cruiser &quot;Ochakov&quot;, which Kuprin witnessed in Balaklava. His later tale &quot;The Caterpillar&quot; (1918) reveals that he helped to rescue several sailors who escaped from the blazing cruiser. The Black Sea Fleet commander, Admiral Grigory Chukhnin, generally seen as responsible for the tragedy, ordered Kuprin to leave Sevastopol within 48 hours, and instituted legal proceedings for defamation. In June 1906 Chukhnin was assassinated; but the case was not closed; and two years later in Zhitomir Kuprin was sentenced to a fine and ten days&#x27; house arrest.

Among his better known stories of the mid-1900s were &quot;Dreams&quot;, &quot;The Toast&quot;, &quot;Art&quot;, and &quot;The Murderer&quot;, the latter taking up the issue of violence that swept over Russia at the time. &quot;Junior Captain Rybnikov&quot; (1906), which told the tale of a Japanese spy posing as a Russian officer, was praised by Gorky. Much discussed were &quot;An Insult&quot; (1906) - and &quot;Gambrinus&quot; (1907), an emotional summation of many motifs of his writing after 1905, echoing the declamatory tone of &quot;Events in Sevastopol&quot;, according to Luker.

From 1905 onwards, Kuprin again became engaged in numerous non-literary fields. He put himself forward as an elector to the first State Duma for the city of Petersburg. In 1909–1910 he made an air balloon flight with a renowned sportsman, Sergey Utochkin, then ventured into the Black Sea depths as a diver, and accompanied the airman Ivan Zaikin in his airplane trips. In 1907 he divorced his first wife - and married Yelizaveta Geinrikh (1882–1943), who in 1908 gave birth to their daughter Ksenia Kuprina.In 1908 Kuprin&#x27;s relationship with Gorky deteriorated, and he quit Znanye. The same year saw the publication of &quot;Seasickness&quot;, a short story telling of the rape of a Social Democrat heroine - and showing her revolutionary husband in an unfavorable light, which Gorky regarded as a deliberate slur on the Russian Socialists. Among Kuprin&#x27;s other works of the period are &quot;Emerald&quot; (1907), the most famous of his animal stories, &quot;Sulamith&quot; (1908), an ode to &#x27;eternal love&#x27;, closely based on The Song of Songs, the autobiographical &quot;Lenochka&quot; (1910), and &quot;The Garnet Bracelet&quot; (1911), his famous &#x27;doomed romanticism&#x27; novella, where hopeless love finds its quietly tragic apotheosis. &quot;The Lestrigons&quot; (1907–1911), a set of sketches on the fishermen of Balaklava, provided a lyrical paean to the simple life and an epic glorification of the virtues of its simple folk. In October 1909 Kuprin and Bunin were jointly awarded the Pushkin Prize.

=== &quot;The Pit&quot; (1909) ===
In 1908 Kuprin started working on &quot;&quot;, his most ambitious and controversial work. The first part of this novelistic study of prostitution appeared in 1909, the second in 1914, and the third in 1915. Part I, as it came out, provoked widespread controversy; parts II and III were met with almost universal indifference. Kuprin, who could not decide, apparently, whether his novel should be a documentary or fiction, either oscillated between the two or attempted to combine them in an artificial way. &quot;He is more successful when in documentary vein, and so Part I, with its details of life in the brothel, is by far the best,&quot; argues Luker. The novel was criticized by some Russian critics and authors (Leo Tolstoy among them) for excessive naturalism; among those who admired it was the young Nina Berberova.
&quot;The Pit&quot; was Kuprin&#x27;s last major work, and to many it signaled the decline of his creativity. His best-known 1912–1914 stories are &quot;Black Lightning&quot; and &quot;Anathema&quot;, while his visit to the South of France between April and July 1912 gave rise to &quot;The Cote d&#x27;Azur&quot;, the twenty sketches forming a cycle of travel impressions. In 1911 he moved his family to Gatchina, near Saint Petersburg.

As World War I broke out, Kuprin opened a military hospital in his Gatchina home, then visited towns on the Western front. Towards the end of 1914 he appealed through the press for money for the wounded, and in December rejected the idea of celebrating the 25th anniversary of his literary career. As a reserve officer he was called up in November 1914, and commanded an infantry company in Finland till May 1915, when he was discharged on grounds of ill health. That was the reason why he could not become a war correspondent, a career he aspired to during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905. Among his few stories that reflected the war, most notable were his satires (&quot;Goga Veselov&quot;, &quot;The Cantaloups&quot;, &quot;Daddy&quot;, &quot;Grunya&quot;), taking a swipe at the cynics who were making fortunes upon the nation&#x27;s grievances.

The February Revolution found Kuprin in Helsinki, where he had gone on medical advice. Returning to Gatchina, he expressed his enthusiasm at the collapse of tsarism in a series of articles, and in May started editing the Socialist Revolutionary Party&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Svobodnaia Rossiya&quot; (Free Russia), contributing also to &quot;Volnost&quot; (Freedom) and &quot;Petrogradskii Listok&quot; (The Petrograd Leaflet). While welcoming the freedom brought by the February Revolution, he foresaw the excesses that further upheaval might bring, and warned against Russia&#x27;s plunging into an orgy of bloodshed.

The October Revolution did little to clarify Kuprin&#x27;s political position. In the articles he contributed to various papers till mid-1918 – &quot;Petrogradskoe Ekho&quot; (Petrograd Echo), &quot;Vecherneye Slovo&quot; (Evening Word), and &quot;Zaria&quot; (Dawn) among them – his attitude to the new regime remained ambivalent. He recognized the historical significance of the Bolshevik Revolution, and admired Lenin as &quot;an honest and courageous man,&quot; stating that &quot;Bolshevism constitutes a great, pure, disinterested doctrine, that is inevitable for mankind.&quot; Still, while working for a brief time with Maxim Gorky at the World Literature publishing company, he criticized prodrazverstka and the policy of War Communism, arguing that the Bolsheviks threatened Russian culture, and that their insufficient knowledge of the country had brought suffering to peasants. In June 1918 Kuprin was arrested for a short time for an article in the paper &quot;Molva&quot; (Rumor) critical of the regime. One of his 1918 stories (&quot;The Caterpillar&quot;) praised the heroism of women revolutionaries, another (&quot;The Ghost of Gatchina&quot;) was an anti-Bolshevik tale of the tyranny of Russia&#x27;s new masters.

At the end of 1918 Kuprin drew up elaborate plans for &quot;Zemlia&quot; (Land), a paper designed especially for the peasantry. His proposed program involved assisting the government in the radical transformation of rural life, along lines not conflicting with the principles of communism. Supported by Gorky and approved by Lenin, who met Kuprin on 25 December 1918, the project remained unrealized.

== Years in emigration ==

On 16 October 1919 Gatchina was taken by the White Army, led by General Nikolai Yudenich. For a fortnight Kuprin was editing &quot;Prinevsky Krai&quot; (Neva Country), a paper published by Yudenich&#x27;s army headquarters. In October, as the Whites retreated westward, Kuprin traveled with them to Yamburg, where he joined his wife and daughter. Via Narva the family reached Revel in Estonia, and in December left for Finland. After half a year in Helsinki, they sailed for France, arriving in Paris in early July 1920.

The next seventeen years in Paris saw the decline of Kuprin&#x27;s creativity and his succumbing to alcoholism. Grieved at his separation from Russia, he became lonely and withdrawn. The family&#x27;s poverty made the situation worse. &quot;I am left naked ... and destitute as a homeless old dog,&quot; Kuprin wrote to Ivan Zaikin, an old friend. All this combined to hinder his writing. &quot;The more talented a man is, the harder is for him life without Russia,&quot; Kuprin told a reporter in 1925.

Kuprin&#x27;s nostalgia explains the retrospective quality of his work after he had emigrated. He returned to familiar themes from his earlier writing - and dwelled on personal experiences, linking him with the homeland he had lost. His visit to southwest France in 1925 inspired &quot;Crimson Blood&quot; (1926), a colorful account of a bullfight in Bayonne, followed in 1927 by &quot;The Blessed South&quot;, four sketches on Gascony and the Hautes-Pyrénées. Then came the predominantly urban sketches made in Yugoslavia, the result of Kuprin&#x27;s visit to Belgrade in 1928, to attend a conference of Russian writers who had also emigrated. The three major works of Kuprin&#x27;s Parisian years were &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; (13 sketches styled as a novel, 1929), the autobiographical &quot;The Junkers&quot; (1932), and the romantic &quot;Jeannette&quot; (1933), describing an elderly professor&#x27;s affection for a little girl in his neighborhood.

== Return to Russia and death ==

By 1930 Kuprin&#x27;s family was in poverty and debt. His literary fees were meager; heavy drinking dogged his Parisian years; after 1932 his sight began to deteriorate; and his handwriting became impaired. His wife&#x27;s attempts to establish a book-binding shop and a library for émigrés were financial disasters. A return to the Soviet Union offered the only solution to Kuprin&#x27;s material and psychological difficulties. In late 1936 he finally decided to apply for a visa. On 29 May 1937, seen off only by their daughter, the Kuprins left the Gare du Nord for Moscow. On 31 May they were met there by representatives of writers&#x27; organizations, and installed in the Metropole Hotel. In early June they moved to a dacha, owned by the Soviet Union of Writers, at Golitsyno, outside Moscow, where Kuprin received medical attention, and rested till the winter. In mid-December he and his wife moved to an apartment in Leningrad.

The years in Paris had broken his health, and transformed him into an old man. The tragic change was noticed by the writer Nikolay Teleshov, his friend of the early 1900s. Visiting Kuprin shortly after his arrival, Teleshov found him confused, rambling, and pathetic. &quot;He left Russia ... physically very robust and strong,&quot; he wrote later, &quot;but returned an emaciated, ... feeble, weak-willed invalid. This was no longer Kuprin – that man of outstanding talent; it was something ... weak, sad, and visibly dying.&quot; Later Bunin insisted that Kuprin&#x27;s role was purely passive: &quot;He did not go to Russia – he was taken there, very ill, already in his second childhood,&quot; he wrote.

Kuprin&#x27;s return earned publication of his works within the Soviet Union, but he wrote practically nothing new after that. In June 1937, to mark the first anniversary of Gorky&#x27;s death in June, &quot;Izvestiya&quot; published Kuprin&#x27;s &quot;Fragments of Memoirs&quot;. In October the sketch &quot;My Native Moscow&quot; came out. Memoirs about Kuprin&#x27;s last days, published in the Soviet Union, give us a picture of a man, happy with his return to his native country. On the other hand, in her account of Kuprin&#x27;s last months, the writer Lydia Nord painted a picture of a disillusioned old man, who felt he was a stranger in his native country.

In January 1938 Kuprin&#x27;s health deteriorated. By July his condition was grave. Already suffering from a kidney disorder and sclerosis, he had now developed cancer of the oesophagus. Surgery did little to help. Alexander Kuprin died on 25 August 1938, and was interred in Volkovo Cemetery&#x27;s Literaturskiye Mostki (Literary Bridge) in Leningrad two days later.

==Private life==

In February 1902, Kuprin married Maria Karlovna Davydova (1881—1966), the adopted daughter of Alexandra Davydova, the widow of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory&#x27;s director who, after her husband&#x27;s death in 1889, became editor of &quot;Mir Bozhy&quot;. When she died in 1902, Maria Karlovna took over it and soon Kuprin became the head of the fiction section of his wife&#x27;s journal. They had one daughter, Lidia (1903–1924).

In the mid-1900s their relationships deteriorated, Kuprin&#x27;s alcohol abuse being the major reason. On one occasion, outraged by his behavior in the company of drunkards and prostitutes whom he brought to their dacha, Maria Karlovna crashed a decanter over his head. Another incident when, during an ugly row, he tried to set her dress on fire, proved to be their last: in 1907 the couple divorced. Maria Davydova later married the Soviet diplomat Nikolai Iordansky; in 1966 her book of memoirs &quot;Years of Youth&quot; (Годы молодости, 1966) came out.

Kurpin&#x27;s second wife was Yelizaveta Geinrikh (1882–1942), a daughter of the Hungarian revolutionary Morits Rotoni-Geinrich, brought up by the family of Dmitry Mamin-Sibiryak, her sister Maria&#x27;s husband. In the early 1900s she was a sister of mercy, later Lidia&#x27;s governess and Alexandra Davydova&#x27;s good friend. In 1907 the couple married and settled in Gatchina. In 1908 their daughter Ksenia was born. Their second daughter Zinaida was born in 1909 and died of pneumonia in 1912. After the Kuprins&#x27; return to Russia Yelizaveta Kuprina-Geinrikh devoted herself to compiling and publishing her husband&#x27;s literary legacy. She committed suicide in 1942, during the Siege of Leningrad.

Ksenia Kuprina (1908–1981) in the late 1920s became a Paul Poiret model and then actress who, as Kissa Kuprine, appeared in 11 films, starting with &quot;Le Diable au cœur&quot; (1927) by Marcel L&#x27;Herbier. After her return to the USSR in 1958, she worked as stage actress, translator, author and scriptwriter. Her book of memoirs &quot;My Father Kuprin&quot; (Мой отец – Куприн) came out in 1978.

==Legacy==
According to Nicholas Luker: Kuprin&#x27;s position in the history of Russian literature is highly significant, if not unique. Born into an age overshadowed by the great Russian novel, which had reached its zenith in the 1860s. he turned to the short story as the genre suited both to his own restless temperament and to the manifold preoccupations of his generation... With his contemporaries Chekhov, Gorky, and Bunin. he brought the genre of the short story to an efflorescence without parallel in Russian letters. What he conceded in restraint to Chekhov, conviction to Gorky, and subtlety to Bunin, Kuprin made up for in narrative pace, construction of plot, and richness of theme. These latter qualities, coupled with his abiding interest in the human soul, make him still very readable today.
Made famous by his novel &quot;The Duel&quot; (1905), Kuprin was highly praised by fellow writers including Anton Chekhov, Maxim Gorky, Leonid Andreyev, Nobel Prize-winning Ivan Bunin and Leo Tolstoy who acclaimed him a true successor to Chekhov. Although he lived in an age when writers were carried away by literary experiments, Kuprin did not seek innovation and wrote only about the things he himself had experienced and his heroes are the next generation after Chekhov&#x27;s pessimists. Vladimir Nabokov styled him &quot;the Russian Kipling&quot; for his stories about pathetic adventure-seekers, who are often &quot;neurotic and vulnerable.&quot; All through the 20th century Alexander Kuprin remained &quot;one of the widest read classics in Russian literature,&quot; with many films based on his works, partly due to &quot;his vivid stories of the lives of ordinary people and unhappy love, his descriptions of the military and brothels, making him a writer for all times and places.&quot;

A minor planet 3618 Kuprin, discovered by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh in 1979, is named after him.

<text>Joseph Weigl (28 March 1766 – 3 February 1846) was an Austrian composer and conductor, born in Eisenstadt, Hungary, Austrian Empire.

The son of Joseph Franz Weigl (1740–1820), the principal cellist in the orchestra of the Esterházy family, he studied music under Johann Georg Albrechtsberger, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri. He became Kapellmeister at the court theatre in Vienna in 1792, and from 1827 to 1838, was vice-Kapellmeister of the court.

Weigl composed a number of operas, both Italian and German and in various genres, although most of his late works are pieces of sacred music. His best known work was the opera &quot;Die Schweizerfamilie&quot; (1809). He also set Emanuel Schikaneder&#x27;s libretto &quot;Vestas Feuer&quot; (1805), after his close friend Ludwig van Beethoven had composed a single scene and then abandoned it. Weigl died in Vienna in 1846.

His younger brother Thaddäus Weigl was a composer and music publisher.

<text>Joseph Franz Weigl (19 May 1740 - 25 January 1820) was a Bavarian and Austrian cellist. He was a cellist in the orchestra of the Esterházy family. He played under the directorship of Joseph Haydn, who also was godfather to the cellist&#x27;s son, and it is thought that Haydn wrote his cello concerto in C major (Hob. VIIb/1) for him.

He was the father of Joseph Weigl (1766–1846), the composer and conductor, and Thaddäus Weigl (1776–1844), the composer and music publisher.</text><links>

<text>William Daniel Hillis (born September 25, 1956) is an American inventor, entrepreneur, and computer scientist, who pioneered parallel computers and their use in artificial intelligence. He founded Thinking Machines Corporation, a parallel supercomputer manufacturer, and subsequently was Vice President of Research and Disney Fellow at Walt Disney Imagineering.

Hillis was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2001 for advances in parallel computers, parallel software, and parallel storage.

More recently, Hillis co-founded Applied Minds, and Applied Invention, an interdisciplinary group of engineers, scientists, and artists. 

==Biography==

===Early life and academic work===

Born September 25, 1956, in Baltimore, Maryland, Danny Hillis spent much of his childhood living overseas, in Europe, Africa, and Asia.

He attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and received his bachelor of science in mathematics in 1978. As an undergraduate, he worked at the MIT Logo Laboratory under the tutelage of Seymour Papert, developing computer hardware and software for children. During this time, he also designed computer-oriented toys and games for the Milton Bradley Company. While still in college, he co-founded Terrapin Inc., a producer of computer software, including Logo, for elementary schools.

As a graduate student at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Hillis designed tendon-controlled robot arms and a touch-sensitive robot &quot;skin&quot;.

During his college years, Hillis was part of the team that built a computer composed entirely of Tinkertoys, currently at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California.

At MIT, Hillis began to study Artificial Intelligence under Marvin Minsky. In 1981, he proposed building a massively parallel computer for Artificial Intelligence, consisting of a million processors, each similar to a modern Graphics Processing Unit. This work culminated in the design of a massively parallel computer with 64,000 processor cores. He named it the Connection Machine, and it became the topic of his PhD, for which he received the 1985 Association for Computing Machinery Doctoral Dissertation award. Hillis earned his doctorate as a Hertz Foundation Fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, under the supervision of Marvin Minsky, Claude Shannon and Gerald Sussman, receiving his PhD in 1988. He later served as an adjunct professor at the MIT Media Lab, where he wrote &quot;The Pattern on the Stone&quot;.

==Technology career==

Hillis has founded a number of technology companies, including Thinking Machines Corporation, Applied Minds, Metaweb Technologies, Applied Proteomics, and Applied Invention. Hillis has over 300 issued patents in fields including parallel computers, touch interfaces, disk arrays, forgery prevention methods, electronic and mechanical devices, and bio-medical techniques, RAID disk arrays, multicore multiprocessors and for wormhole routing in parallel processing.

===Thinking Machines===

As a graduate student at MIT, Hillis co-founded Thinking Machines Corporation to produce and market parallel computers, developing a series of influential products called the Connection Machine. At the time the company produced many of the fastest computers in the world. The Connection Machine was used in demanding computation and data-intensive applications. It was used by the Stanford Exploration Project for oil exploration and for pioneering data mining applications by American Express, as well as many scientific applications at organizations including Schlumberger, Harvard University, University of Tokyo, the Los Alamos National Laboratory, NASA, Sandia National Laboratories, National Center for Supercomputer Applications, Army High Performance Computing Research Center, University of California Berkeley, University of Wisconsin at Madison, and Syracuse University.

In addition to designing the company&#x27;s major products, Hillis worked closely with users of his machine, applying it to problems in astrophysics, aircraft design, financial analysis, genetics, computer graphics, medical imaging, image understanding, neurobiology, materials science, cryptography, and subatomic physics.

At Thinking Machines, he built a team of scientists, designers, and engineers, including people in the field as well as those who later became leaders and innovators in multiple industries. The team included Sydney Brenner, Richard Feynman, Brewster Kahle, and Eric Lander.

Among the users of Thinking Machines computers was Sergey Brin, who went on later to found Google, and Neal Stephenson, who attempted to use a CM-2 to implement a game that he later turned into the novel Snow Crash.

===Disney Imagineering===

In 1996, Hillis joined The Walt Disney Company in the newly created role of Disney Fellow and as vice president, Research and Development at Disney Imagineering. He developed new technologies and business strategies for Disney&#x27;s theme parks, television, motion pictures, and consumer products businesses. He also designed new theme park rides, a full-sized walking dinosaur, and various micro mechanical devices.

===Applied Minds===
In 2000, Hillis co-founded the R&amp;D think-tank Applied Minds with his Disney colleague Bran Ferren. Minds is a team of engineers, scientists, and designers that provide design and technology services for clients. The creative environment and the diverse projects it undertook gained Applied Minds abundant media attention. &quot;It&#x27;s as if Willy Wonka&#x27;s chocolate factory just yawned wide to welcome us. Only here, all the candy plugs in,&quot; said an article in &quot;Wired&quot; magazine. Work done at the firm covered the range of industries and application domains, including satellites, helicopters, and educational facilities.

While at Applied Minds, Hillis designed and built a large-scale computer data center for Sun Microsystems (the Sun Modular Datacenter) that would fit into a standard 20-foot shipping container, solving, among others, the problems of accommodating processor capacity, cooling, power requirements, and storage within a uniquely portable solution. This type of &quot;datacenter in a box,&quot; has now become a common method for building large data centers.

For Herman Miller, Hillis designed an audio privacy solution based on phonetic jumbling—Babble—which was received in the media as a version of the Cone of Silence, and was marketed through a new company, Sonare. Also for Herman Miller, Hillis developed a flexible reconfigurable power and lighting system, which was marketed through another new company, Convia.

As part of an early touchscreen map table interface, Hillis invented and patented the use of multiple touch points to control a zoom interface, which is now called &quot;pinch to zoom.&quot;. One of these patents was the basis for the USPTO decision to reject Apple Inc.&#x27;s claim on a &quot;pinch-to-zoom&quot; patent in its legal dispute with Samsung, on the grounds that it was described in the Hillis patent.

===Metaweb Technologies===

In 2005, Hillis and others from Applied Minds founded Metaweb Technologies to develop a semantic data storage infrastructure for the Internet, and Freebase, an open, structured database of the world&#x27;s knowledge. That company was acquired by Google, and its technology became the basis of the Google Knowledge Graph.

===Cancer research and Applied Proteomics===

In 2012, Hillis helped to create a research program on cancer and proteomics as Professor of Research Medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, and the principal investigator of the National Cancer Institute&#x27;s Physical Sciences in Oncology Laboratory at USC. He co-founded Applied Proteomics (API) with David Agus to make proteomics-based biomarker discovery practical. Hillis and his colleagues at API developed one of the first protein biomarker discovery platforms and a blood test for early stage colon cancer, but they were unable to convince investors to finance taking their proteomic technology to the market.

Hillis has academic appointments as the Judge Widney Professor of Engineering and Medicine at the University of Southern California, Professor of Research Medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, and research professor of engineering at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering. He was the first principal investigator of the National Cancer Institute&#x27;s Physical Sciences in Oncology Laboratory at USC.

===Applied Invention===

In 2015, Hillis co-founded Applied Invention, an interdisciplinary group of engineers, scientists, and artists. Applied Invention develops technology solutions in partnership with other companies and entrepreneurs.

Applied Invention co-founded Dark Sky, a weather forecasting technology company with consumer web and mobile applications that was eventually sold to Apple.

==&quot;The Pattern on the Stone&quot;==
Hillis&#x27; 1998 popular science book &quot;The Pattern on the Stone&quot; attempts to explain concepts from computer science for laymen using simple language, metaphor and analogy. It moves from Boolean algebra through topics such as information theory, parallel computing, cryptography, algorithms, heuristics, Turing machines, and evolving technologies such as quantum computing and emergent systems.

==The Long Now Foundation==
In 1986, Hillis expressed alarm that society had what he called a &quot;mental barrier&quot; of looking at the year 2000 as the limit of the future. He proposed a project to build a mechanical clock that would last 10,000 years. This project became the initial project of The Long Now Foundation, which he co-founded with Stewart Brand and where he serves as co-chairman. A prototype of the Clock of the Long Now is on display at the London Science Museum. A full-scale mechanical clock is being installed at a site inside a mountain in western Texas.

==Awards==
Hillis is the recipient of the inaugural Dan David Prize for shaping and enriching society and public life in 2002, the 1991 Spirit of American Creativity Award for his inventions, the 1989 Grace Murray Hopper Award for his contributions to computer science, and the 1988 Ramanujan Award for his work in applied mathematics.

Hillis is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery, a fellow of the International Leadership Forum, and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

<doc id="328909" wikidata="Q6140781" url="?curid=328909" title="Jim Gray (jurist)">
<text>James Polin Gray (born February 14, 1945) is an American jurist and writer. He was the presiding judge of the Superior Court of Orange County, California. Gray was the 2012 Libertarian Party vice presidential nominee, as well as the party&#x27;s 2004 candidate for the United States Senate in California. He is the author of multiple books and a play, and is an outspoken critic of American drug laws.

Gray has been a member of the California Judicial Council, as well as the California Judicial Council&#x27;s Advisory Committee on Juvenile Law, the Alcohol Advisory Board to the Orange County Board of Supervisors, the Advisory Board of the California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs, and the Orange County Law Library.
He has also been a member of the Board of Councilors of the University of Southern California Law School. Gray also introduced Orange County to the Peer Court system, where juvenile defendants travel to a school outside their district to have their actual cases tried by other teenagers. In 2012, Gray was nominated by Libertarian Party convention delegates as the running mate of former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson.

He unsuccessfully sought the Libertarian presidential nomination in the 2020 election.

==Background==
Born in Washington, D.C., and raised in the Los Angeles, California, area, Gray earned his undergraduate degree from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1966, after which he taught in the Peace Corps in Costa Rica. Gray returned to California and earned a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Southern California Law School in 1971.

==Judicial career==
From 1972 through 1975, Gray practiced law as a Lieutenant with the United States Navy Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Corps at Naval Air Station Agana in Guam and Naval Air Station Lemoore in California.

After five years in private practice, he was named to the Santa Ana Municipal Court in 1983 by Governor George Deukmejian, who then appointed Gray to the Orange County Superior Court in 1989. Gray retired as a judge in January 2009. Much of his legal career has dealt with drug-related issues.

==2004 U.S. Senate candidacy==

Following an unsuccessful bid in 1998 for the Republican nomination for the congressional seat in California&#x27;s 46th congressional district, Gray left the Republican Party and joined the Libertarian Party. In 2003, he openly considered making a run for the 2004 Libertarian presidential nomination, but eventually decided to instead run for the U.S. Senate. In November 2003, he declared his candidacy for the U.S. Senate seat occupied by Barbara Boxer in California. Gray was a keynote speaker at the 2004 Libertarian National Convention. In March 2004 Gray defeated former Libertarian Party of California chair Gail Lightfoot in a statewide primary for the party&#x27;s nomination for U.S. Senate. Gray suspended his judicial activities while running for the Senate against incumbent Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer and Republican Bill Jones. Gray received 216,522 votes, 1.8% of the total vote, finishing behind Boxer, Jones, and Peace and Freedom Party candidate Marsha Feinland.

==Activism as War on Drugs opponent==
Gray is an outspoken critic of drug laws and the War on Drugs, particularly in the state of California. He was a proponent of the Regulate, Control and Tax Cannabis Act of 2010, a statewide referendum measure that was defeated in the 2010 California state elections.

He is the author of &quot;Why Our Drug Laws Have Failed and What We Can Do About It – A Judicial Indictment of the War on Drugs&quot; (2001), and appears in the 2007 documentary &quot;American Drug War: The Last White Hope&quot;.

In early 2011 Gray was one of the four co-sponsors of an initiative called Regulate Marijuana Like Wine. Had it passed, the initiative would have regulated cannabis consumption and production like wine in California. While the measure failed to collect the minimum number of signatures needed for qualification to be placed on the ballot in the 2012 statewide election, Gray&#x27;s active role in the effort prompted media speculation regarding his future in the Libertarian Party and in national politics.

==2012 vice-presidential candidacy==

On April 27, 2012, the question &quot;What would you think of Judge Gray running for Vice President?&quot; was posted from Gray&#x27;s Facebook page, and received numerous positive responses. Within three days of the posting, it was confirmed that Gray had been chosen by 2012 Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson to be his preferred running mate should Johnson receive the party&#x27;s nomination at the 2012 Libertarian National Convention. Gray then confirmed his candidacy for the Libertarian vice-presidential nomination in an open letter to the party&#x27;s Convention delegates. On May 5, 2012, Gray won the Libertarian Party (LP) vice-presidential nomination on the first ballot with 60% of the vote. He ran on the ticket with Johnson, who received the LP presidential nomination.
==2020 presidential campaign==
On April 13, 2020, Gray announced his intention to seek the Libertarian Party&#x27;s nomination for president with Larry Sharpe as his running mate. The announcement came in response to Lincoln Chafee exiting the race. He dropped out on May 23, 2020.

== Personal life ==
Gray resides in Newport Beach, California. He is married, and is the father of three children.

<doc id="328912" wikidata="Q616417" url="?curid=328912" title="Later... with Jools Holland">
<text>Later... with Jools Holland (also known as Even Later... with Jools Holland, and previously known as Later Live... with Jools Holland and ...Later with Jools Holland) is a contemporary British music television show hosted by Jools Holland. A spin-off of &quot;The Late Show&quot;, it has been running in short series since 8 October 1992 and is now part of BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Music&quot; block, usually broadcast at around 10pm. The day of transmission has varied over the years, but it is usually recorded on a Tuesday for Saturday broadcast and features a mixture of both established and new musical artists, from solo performers to bands and larger ensembles.

The show is considered an institution, having millions of fans around the world. It is currently broadcast in America on MTV Live (formerly known as Palladia); previously it had been shown on Ovation, BBC America, Fuse, and Dave. The Ovation and Fuse broadcasts leave out several performances (and usually one or two performers entirely) to air commercials within a one-hour timeslot. It is also shown in Australia on the UKTV channel and ABC2, in Canada on HIFI and AUX TV, in Germany on ZDFkultur, in Spain on Canal+ Xtra, in Croatia on HRT 2, in Latin America on Film&amp;Arts and in Belgium, France, Portugal, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates on iConcerts HD, and in Ireland on TG4.

The 200th programme was broadcast on 1 February 2008. The 250th edition was broadcast in September 2010.

==Programme format==

&quot;Later...&quot; draws from a diverse palette of both popular and world music, and each show features around five bands with a variety of styles performing for each other and a studio audience of around 300 people. Jools Holland introduces the show and interviews one or more of the performers. A unique feature is the short jam session that begins each show, involving all of his invited guests, along with Holland on piano. This beginning jam session also best shows the unusual layout of the set – all the bands are arrayed in a circle with the audience filling in the gaps between them. Holland often also accompanies his guests&#x27; performances, with mixed results – Mark E. Smith of the Fall insisted that he would only appear on the show if Holland would promise not to play piano over any of his songs. Over time, these jam sessions have changed - the end of the hour-long show ends with a jam session now - and Jools accompanies relatively few artists in comparison to earlier seasons. The international singer Anastacia performed live along Jools on the piano the non-single song &quot;Ask Of You&quot;.

On 1 April 2008, a new format was debuted, featuring a 30-minute, fully live show broadcast on a Tuesday, &quot;Later Live... with Jools Holland&quot;, followed by the original hour-long pre-recorded show, &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot;, typically broadcast on a Friday. The Friday show features the performances recorded on a Tuesday as well as others recorded during the session for the live show. The HD hour-long broadcasts use Dolby Digital 5.1, which adds to the overall ambience of the studio environment. For Series 51, the hour-long show was moved to Saturday nights, seemingly to accommodate the new BBC One show, &quot;Sounds Like Friday Night&quot;.

After the 2012 closure of BBC Television Centre for redevelopment, production from April 2013 moved to Studio 1 at The Maidstone Studios, close to Holland&#x27;s home in Cooling, Kent.

&quot;Later...&quot; and &quot;Jools&#x27; Annual Hootenanny&quot; were opened up to tender in 2018, with the contract to produce the show being retained by BBC Studios. A number of changes were made to the show&#x27;s format, with the 60-minute show having a more relaxed feel, including &quot;bespoke films and backstage interviews&quot;. Each 60-minute programme also saw Holland joined by a special guest to co-host. The October 2019 series of the programme saw it return to Television Centre, where it was filmed until 2012. It is filmed in TC1, the largest studio on the site.

As of Series 54 both editions are pre-recorded: the 30 minute edition airs Thursday night at 10pm, with the 60 minute &quot;Even Later&quot; edition airing Friday night, usually at around 11 pm to 12 midnight, as part of BBC Two&#x27;s post-&quot;Newsnight&quot; late-night line-up.

In 2020, the format was changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with Holland introducing guests via videolink from his Helicon Mountain home studio and the programme becoming 45 minutes in length, as &quot;Newsnight&quot; was now starting at 10:45pm.

After a number of years where the show had been broadcast on Tuesday and Friday nights, in October 2021, series 59 started to be broadcast on a Saturday, still in a 45 minute format, at around 10pm, as part of a schedule block devoted to music programming. In 2022, the programme moved from Helicon Mountain to a permanent location at the restored Alexandra Palace Theatre in North London, with Wet Leg, Joe Bonamassa and Cat Burns appearing on the first episode recorded at the theatre, which was episode one of series 60.

==Special editions==
Occasional special editions of the show showcase a major artist under the &quot;Later...&quot; banner, with the &quot;Later presents...&quot; title. Artists featured in these shows have included Alice in Chains in 1992, Paul Weller and Metallica in 1996, R.E.M. and the Verve in 1998, Oasis in 2000, Radiohead in 2001 and 2007, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 2007. The bands in question play for the duration of the hour-long show. Despite the different name, the show is still introduced by Jools Holland and takes place in a similarly set-up studio.

The special episode featuring M People in 1998 was later released on video and DVD under the title &quot;One Night in Heaven&quot;. Also, a selection of the songs from the programme have been released on the limited edition of &quot;The Best of M People&quot; album and as a b-side to the single &quot;Dreaming&quot;.

Special editions broadcast on New Year&#x27;s Eve each year are referred to as &quot;Jools Holland&#x27;s Hootenanny&quot; and are pre-recorded, typically in early December. In 2003 a &#x27;Spring Hootenanny&#x27; was broadcast, which proved to be a one-off.

In 2017, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the show, a &quot;Later 25&quot; show was held at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall - it was recorded on 21 September 2017 and broadcast two days later on the 23rd. The setup was roughly similar, with bands located around the arena of the Hall with some artists also on the stage. The 2 hour long show featured 10 artists.

Repeated excerpts from the show were broadcast under the title &quot;A Little Later&quot; as fill-in programmes on BBC HD, while in 2022, BBC Four had a number of new &quot;Later&quot; compilations made for the channel, themed around various musical genres like pop or musical collaborations.

On 12 November 2022 a special &quot;30th Birthday Bash&quot; programme, recorded at London’s Eventim Apollo in London, was broadcast on BBC 2. It was followed by the special &quot;The A-Z of &quot;Later... with Jools Holland: From Adele to ZZ Top&quot;, narrated by comedian Paul Whitehouse.

==Criticism==
In 2008, the head rock and pop critic of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Alexis Petridis, claimed the programme featured a &quot;distinct lack of spontaneity&quot; and was failing to showcase enough dance music, pop, hip-hop, experimental music or present R&amp;B artists. He also argued &quot;all the artists it breaks are essentially the same: MOR singer-songwriters&quot;.

In 2010, Joe Elliott, lead singer of rock band Def Leppard, criticised the programme for excluding the band from appearing on it, claiming &quot;Jools Holland won&#x27;t have us on his show because we&#x27;re not cool enough.&quot;

==Accolades==
In 2000, the series was ranked at number 81 in the British Film Institute&#x27;s list of the &quot;BFI TV 100&quot;, listing the top 100 British television programmes of the 20th century.

<doc id="328916" wikidata="Q1972118" url="?curid=328916" title="Edge connector">
<text>An edge connector is the portion of a printed circuit board (PCB) consisting of traces leading to the edge of the board that are intended to plug into a matching socket. The edge connector is a money-saving device because it only requires a single discrete female connector (the male connector is formed out of the edge of the PCB), and they also tend to be fairly robust and durable. They are commonly used in computers for expansion slots for peripheral cards, such as PCI, PCI Express, and AGP cards.

== Socket design ==
Edge connector sockets consist of a plastic &quot;box&quot; open on one side, with pins on one or both sides of the longer edges, sprung to push into the middle of the open center. Connectors are often keyed to ensure the correct polarity, and may contain bumps or notches both for polarity and to ensure that the wrong type of device is not inserted. The socket&#x27;s width is chosen to fit to the thickness of the connecting PCB.

The opposite side of the socket is often an insulation-piercing connector which is clamped onto a ribbon cable. Alternatively, the other side may be soldered to a motherboard or daughtercard.

== Uses ==

Edge connectors are commonly used in personal computers for connecting expansion cards and computer memory to the system bus. Example expansion peripheral technologies which use edge connectors include PCI, PCI Express, and AGP. Slot 1 and Slot A also used edge connectors; the processor being mounted on a card with an edge connector, instead of directly to the motherboard as before and since.

IBM PCs used edge connector sockets attached to ribbon cables to connect 5.25&quot; floppy disk drives. 3.5&quot; drives use a pin connector instead.

Video game cartridges typically take the form of a PCB with an edge connector: the socket is located within the console itself. The Nintendo Entertainment System was unusual in that it was designed to use a zero insertion force edge connector: instead of the user forcing the cartridge into the socket directly, the cartridge was first placed in a bay and then mechanically lowered into position.

Starting with the Amiga 1000 in 1985, various Amiga models used the 86-pin Zorro I edge connector, which was later reshaped into the internal 100-pin Zorro II slot on the Amiga 2000 and later upmarket models.

In 2008 the city hosted a nine-day version of the festival with expanded international participation to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the puppetry festival. Iida&#x27;s connection to the traditional Japanese puppet theater commonly known as &quot;ningyō jōruri&quot; or &quot;Bunraku&quot; goes back more than 300 years. Four traditional puppet troupes are located in or near Iida: the Imada Puppet Troupe, Kuroda Puppet Troupe, the Furuta Puppets, and the Waseda Puppets.

In June, the &quot;Saiwai Shimoina Wadaiko Festival&quot;, a major taiko drum festival takes place in Iida. Each year, top drum groups perform at the &quot;Super Show&quot; while amateur groups perform at the &quot;Fringe Festival.&quot;

Beginning in July, there are many festivals at local shrines. One aspect of these festivals that surprises visitors is the quantity of fireworks. One of the biggest and most spectacular displays of fireworks is the Tōrō-nagashi festival, in Tokimata, held around the 16th of August. The fireworks are also shot off on the surface of the Tenryū River. Another important festival in Iida is Oneri Matsuri, which is held every seventh year (the last being 2016, the next in March, 2022), a massive four-day event, most famous for the &quot;shi-shi&quot; lion dance.

Iida has adopted the apple as its symbol. One of the city&#x27;s largest festivals is the Ringo Matsuri (Apple Festival), held every year in early August, and Iida&#x27;s Ringo Namiki-dori (a street lined with apple trees) is tended by students of the city&#x27;s Higashi Middle School. The area around Iida is well known for extensive peach, apple, and persimmon orchards, as well as the production of many other agricultural products, including Asian pears (&quot;nashi&quot;) and strawberries. A local specialty is &quot;hoshi-gaki&quot;, or dried persimmons.

Iida is also known for the production of &quot;mizuhiki.&quot;

During the Muromachi period, the region came under the control of the Ogasawara Ōi clan. The area had a very unsettled history during the Sengoku period.

<doc id="328929" wikidata="Q1932556" url="?curid=328929" title="Sandline International">
<text>Sandline International was a private military company (PMC) based in London, established in the early 1990s. It was involved in conflicts in Papua New Guinea in 1997 and had a contract with the government under then-Prime Minister Julius Chan, causing the Sandline affair. In 1998 in Sierra Leone Sandline had a contract with ousted the President, Ahmad Tejan Kabbah and in Liberia in 2003 was involved in a rebel attempt to evict the then-president Charles Taylor near the end of the civil war. Sandline ceased all operations on 16 April 2004.
On the company&#x27;s website, a reason for closure is given:
Sandline was founded and managed by retired British Army Lieutenant Colonel Tim Spicer. Sandline billed itself as a PMC and offered military training, &quot;operational support&quot; such as equipment and arms procurement and limited direct military activity, intelligence gathering, and public relations services to governments and corporations. While the mass media often referred to Sandline as a mercenary company, the company&#x27;s founders disputed that characterisation. A commercial adviser for Sandline once told the BBC that the firm saw themselves differently from mercenaries, stating that they were an established entity with “established sets of principles” and that they employed professional people. He reiterated that the firm would not accept contracts from groups or governments that would jeopardise its reputation.

Spicer recounted his experiences with Sandline in the book &quot;An Unorthodox Soldier&quot;.

<doc id="328931" wikidata="Q154423" url="?curid=328931" title="Maud of Wales">
<text>Maud of Wales (Maud Charlotte Mary Victoria; 26 November 1869 – 20 November 1938) was Queen of Norway as the wife of King Haakon VII. The youngest daughter of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom, she was known as Princess Maud of Wales before her marriage, as her father was the Prince of Wales at the time.

==Early life and education==

Maud was born on 26 November 1869 at Marlborough House, London. She was the third daughter and fifth child of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, and Alexandra, Princess of Wales. Albert Edward was the eldest son of Queen Victoria, and Alexandra was the eldest daughter of Christian IX of Denmark. Maud was christened &quot;Maud Charlotte Mary Victoria&quot; at Marlborough House by John Jackson, Bishop of London, on 24 December 1869.
Her godparents were her paternal uncle Prince Leopold, for whom the Duke of Cambridge stood proxy; Prince Frederick William of Hesse-Kassel, for whom Prince Francis of Teck stood proxy; Count Gleichen; the Duchess of Nassau, for whom Princess Francis of Teck stood proxy; Charles XV of Sweden, for whom Swedish minister Baron Hochschild stood proxy; Princess Marie of Leiningen, for whom Princess Claudine of Teck stood proxy; her maternal aunt the Tsarevna of Russia for whom Baroness de Brunnow stood proxy; Crown Princess Louise of Denmark, for whom Madame de Bülow, wife of the Danish minister, stood proxy; and her great-great-aunt the Duchess of Inverness.

The tomboyish Maud was known as &quot;Harry&quot; to the royal family, after Edward VII&#x27;s friend Admiral Henry Keppel, whose conduct in the Crimean War was considered particularly courageous at the time. Maud took part in almost all the annual visits to the Princess of Wales&#x27;s family gatherings in Denmark and later accompanied her mother and sisters on cruises to Norway and the Mediterranean. She was a bridesmaid at the 1885 wedding of her paternal aunt Beatrice to Prince Henry of Battenberg, and at the wedding of her brother George to Mary of Teck in 1893.

Maud, along with her sisters, Victoria and Louise, received the Imperial Order of the Crown of India from their grandmother Queen Victoria on 6 August 1887. Like her sisters, she also held the Royal Order of Victoria and Albert (First Class) and was a Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem.

==Princess of Denmark==

Maud married relatively late, waiting until her late twenties to find a husband. She had initially wanted to marry a distant cousin, Prince Francis of Teck, younger brother of her sister-in-law Mary. Despite being relatively impoverished from mounting gambling debts and being in a position to possibly benefit from Maud&#x27;s status, he ignored her advances.

On 22 July 1896, Princess Maud married her first cousin, Prince Carl of Denmark, in the private chapel at Buckingham Palace. Prince Carl was the second son of Queen Alexandra&#x27;s eldest brother, Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark, and Princess Louise of Sweden. The bride&#x27;s father gave them Appleton House on the Sandringham Estate as a country residence for her frequent visits to England. It was there that the couple&#x27;s only child, Prince Alexander, was born on 2 July 1903.

Prince Carl served as an officer in the Royal Danish Navy, and he and his family lived mainly in Denmark until 1905. In June 1905 the Norwegian Storting dissolved Norway&#x27;s 91-year-old union with Sweden and voted to offer the throne to Prince Carl of Denmark. Maud&#x27;s membership in the British royal house played some part in why Carl was chosen. Following a plebiscite in November, Prince Carl accepted the Norwegian throne as King Haakon VII, while his young son was renamed Olav. King Haakon VII and Queen Maud were crowned at Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim on 22 June 1906; there has not been a coronation in Scandinavia since.

==Queen of Norway==

Queen Maud quickly adapted to her new country and duties as a queen consort. A court was formed, and Marie Magdalena Rustad was appointed her principal lady-in-waiting. Maud played a strong and dominant role within the court and family, but a discreet role in public.

During her first years in Norway, she and her husband were photographed in Norwegian folk costumes, and enjoying winter sports such as skiing, to give them a Norwegian appearance in the eyes of the public. She disliked representation but performed her role as a queen with great care, and used clothes and jewellery to make a regal impression. She supported charitable causes, particularly those associated with children and animals, and gave encouragement to musicians and artists. Among her projects was &quot;Dronningens Hjelpekomité&quot; (the Queen&#x27;s Relief Committee) during World War I. She supported the feminist Katti Anker Møller&#x27;s home for unwed mothers (1906), which was regarded as radical, designed furniture for the benefit of the &quot;Barnets utstilling&quot; (Children&#x27;s Exhibition) 1921, and sold photographs for charitable purposes. An avid rider, Maud insisted that the stables of the royal palace in Oslo be upgraded. Queen Maud supervised much of this project herself and was greatly inspired by the Royal Mews in London when the stables were expanded.

Maud continued to regard Great Britain as her true home even after her arrival in Norway, and visited Great Britain every year. She mostly stayed at her Appleton House, Sandringham, during her visits. She did, however, also appreciate some aspects of Norway, such as the winter sports, and she supported bringing up her son as a Norwegian. She learned to ski and arranged for English gardens at Kongsseteren, the royal lodge overlooking Oslo, and at the summer residence at Bygdøy. She is described as reserved as a public person but energetic and with a taste for practical jokes as a private person.

Queen Maud&#x27;s last public appearance in Britain was at the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in May 1937 at Westminster Abbey. She sat in the royal pew at Westminster Abbey next to her sister-in-law Queen Mary and her niece Mary, Princess Royal, as part of the official royal party.

Maud also acquired a reputation for dressing with fashionable chic. An exhibition of numerous items from her elegant wardrobe was held at the Victoria and Albert Museum in 2005 and published in the catalogue &quot;Style and Splendour: Queen Maud of Norway&#x27;s Wardrobe 1896–1938&quot;.

==Death and legacy==

Maud visited England in October 1938. Initially, she stayed at Sandringham, but then moved into a hotel in London&#x27;s West End. She became ill and was taken to a nursing home at 18 Bentinck Street, Marylebone, London, where an abdominal operation was performed on 16 November 1938, where modern-day information suggests that she suffered from advanced cancer. King Haakon immediately travelled from Norway to her bedside. Although she survived the surgery, Maud died unexpectedly of heart failure on 20 November 1938, six days before her 69th birthday and on the 13th anniversary of her mother&#x27;s death. At the time of her death Queen Maud of Norway was the last surviving child of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra. Norwegian newspapers were allowed to break the law forbidding publication on Sundays in order to notify the Norwegian public of her death. King Haakon returned Appleton House to the British royal family.

Her body was returned to Norway on board , the flagship of the Second Battle Squadron of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Home Fleet. Her body was moved to a small church in Oslo before the burial. Queen Maud was buried in the royal mausoleum at Akershus Castle in Oslo. Her will was sealed in London in 1939. Her estate in England and Wales was valued at £7,941 (or £362,400 in 2022 when adjusted for inflation).

Queen Maud Land and Queen Maud Mountains in Antarctica; Queen Maud Secondary School in Hong Kong; and Queen Maud Gulf (including Queen Maud Gulf Migratory Bird Sanctuary) in Nunavut, Canada, are named after Maud.

During the Edo period the area of Saku developed as the castle town of Tatsuoka Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate and as a post town. Following the post-Meiji restoration cadastral reforms, the area was organised into Saku District, with the town of Asama, and the village of Higashi (from Kitasaku District) merging with the towns of Nozawa and Nakagomi (both from Minamisaku District) to create the city of Saku.

<text>Jamie Macgregor Reid (16 January 1947 – 8 August 2023) was an English visual artist. His best known works include the record cover for the Sex Pistols single &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, which was lauded as &quot;the single most iconic image of the punk era.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Jamie Macgregor Reid was born in London on 16 January 1947 and grew up in Croydon. He was educated at John Ruskin Grammar School. In 1962, he began to study at Wimbledon Art School, then enrolled in Croydon Art School in 1964. With Malcolm McLaren, he took part in a sit-in at Croydon Art School.

==Career==
Reid&#x27;s work often featured letters cut from newspaper headlines in the style of a ransom note, particularly in the UK; he created the ransom-note style while he was designing for &quot;Suburban Press&quot;, a radical political magazine he founded in 1970. His best known works include the Sex Pistols album &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks, Here&#x27;s the Sex Pistols,&quot; and the singles &quot;Anarchy in the U.K.&quot;, &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; (based on a Cecil Beaton photograph of Queen Elizabeth II, with an added safety pin through her nose and swastikas in her eyes, described by Sean O&#x27;Hagan of &quot;The Observer&quot; as &quot;the single most iconic image of the punk era&quot;), &quot;Pretty Vacant&quot;, and &quot;Holidays in the Sun&quot;. The image from &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; was named &quot;the greatest record cover of all time&quot; by &quot;Q&quot; magazine in 2011 and later became part of the collection in the National Portrait Gallery.

Reid produced a series of screen prints in 1997, the twentieth anniversary of the birth of punk rock. Ten years later, on the thirtieth anniversary of the release of &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, Reid produced a new print entitled &quot;Never Trust a Punk&quot;, based on his original design which was exhibited at London Art Fair in the Islington area of the city. He also produced artwork for the world music fusion band Afro Celt Sound System.

Reid&#x27;s exhibitions included &quot;Peace is Tough&quot; at The Arches in Glasgow, and at the Microzine Gallery in Liverpool, where he lived. From 2004, he exhibited and published prints with the Aquarium Gallery, where a career retrospective, &quot;May Day, May Day&quot;, was held in May 2007. Starting in 2004, he exhibited and published work at Steve Lowe&#x27;s new project space the L-13 Light Industrial Workshop in Clerkenwell, London.

In 2009, following allegations Damien Hirst was to sue a student for copyright infringement, Reid called him a &quot;hypocritical and greedy art bully&quot; and, in collaboration with Jimmy Cauty, produced his &quot;For the Love of Disruptive Strategies and Utopian Visions in Contemporary Art and Culture&quot; image as a pastiche, replacing the God Save The Queen with God Save Damien Hirst.

In October 2010, U.S. activist David Jacobs, founder of the early 1970s Situationist group Point-Blank!, challenged claims that Reid created the &quot;Nowhere Buses&quot; graphic which appeared on the sleeve to the Sex Pistols&#x27; 1977 single &quot;Pretty Vacant&quot; and has subsequently been used many times for limited edition prints. Jacobs said he created the design, which first appeared in a pamphlet as part of a protest about mass transit in San Francisco in 1973.

Reid was also involved in direct action campaigns on issues including the poll tax, Clause 28, and the Criminal Justice Bill.

==Personal life==
His former partner was actress Margi Clarke, with whom he had a daughter.

Reid&#x27;s great-uncle was George Watson MacGregor Reid, a modern Druid who established and led the Church of the Universal Bond. Reid was an honorary bard in the Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids and worked with Philip Carr-Gomm, the order&#x27;s former Chosen Chief, to produce a book on the eight festivals of the Druidic calendar.

Reid died on 8 August 2023, at the age of 76, at home in Liverpool.
