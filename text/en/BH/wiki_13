<text>The Union syndicale Solidaires, Solidaires or Solidaires Unitaires Démocratiques (SUD) is a French group of trade unions.

==Political position==

They tend to favor progressive or even radical views and work with the alter-globalization or anti-globalization movement.

The Group of 10 and the SUD Unions are part of the European Social Forum and the World Social Forum.

Most of the SUD trade-union practice a syndicalism of struggle (&quot;syndicalisme de lutte&quot;), like factions of the CGT, FO and the CNT. That places it in opposition to the reformist or negotiation unions: the CFDT, Confédération Française des Travailleurs Chrétiens (CFTC), CFE-CGC and Union nationale des syndicats autonomes (UNSA).

Many members of SUD are also members of the New Anticapitalist Party, but there are also communist, socialist, ecologist, and anarchist sympathizers within the union.

== History ==

The Group of 10 was created in 1981 by autonomous unions, such as the SNUI, or the SNJ, organizing journalists.

Most of these were unions who had refused to choose a side in the 1946 split between the reformist Workers&#x27; Force and the communist CGT.

But several of those unions decided to join UNSA - an alliance of moderate Unions - in 1993, soon after Sud-PTT joined the Group of 10.

The first SUD union was created in 1988 after a split within the CFDT.

The CFDT expelled several unions from the health and the post and telecommunications federations located in the Paris region because they supported wildcat strikes self-organized by the workers. The expelled post and telecommunication unions decided to create a new federation, Sud-PTT, which got encouraging electoral results a few months later.

SUD defends social movement unionism by working with several movements: illegal immigrants, unemployed people and so forth.

The successes of SUD in La Poste and France Télécom convinced other unions from the left wing of the CFDT to create similar unions in their professional sectors and several new SUD unions were formed following the mass public sector strikes of November and December 1995 and May and June 2003.

SUD unions are now important in the health care sector, education, transportation (including the SNCF and Air France), cultural institutions such as the Louvre, as well as in some companies such as Michelin, Thales, or even students with Solidaires étudiant-e-s, syndicat de luttes.

==Professional Elections==

Solidaires won 3.82% of the vote in the employee&#x27;s college during the 2008 professional elections, its best result to date. It had won 1.51% in 2002.

<text>The Mouvement des entreprises de France (MEDEF), or the Movement of the Enterprises of France, is the largest employer federation in France. Established in 1998, it replaced the Conseil national du patronat français ([[CNPF]]), or the &quot;National Council of the French Employers&quot;, which was founded in 1946.

==Operations==
MEDEF has more than 750,000 member firms, 90 percent of them being small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with fewer than 50 employees. MEDEF is engaged in lobbying at local, regional, national, and EU-wide levels.

Every year, MEDEF International organises a number of delegations of French business leaders with tangible projects to targeted countries, especially developing countries. MEDEF espouses “sustainable development”, raising companies’ awareness to the fact that environmental protection can also feature among their competitive advantages.

<text>The Sabirs (Savirs, Suars, Sawar, Sawirk among others; ,) were a nomadic Turkic equestrian people who lived in the north of the Caucasus beginning in the late-5th–7th century, on the eastern shores of the Black Sea, in the Kuban area, and possibly came from Western Siberia. They were skilled in warfare, used siege machinery, had a large army (including women) and were boat-builders. They were also referred to as Huns, a title applied to various Eurasian nomadic tribes in the Pontic-Caspian Steppe during late antiquity. Sabirs led incursions into Transcaucasia in the , but quickly began serving as soldiers and mercenaries during the Byzantine–Sasanian Wars on both sides. Their alliance with the Byzantines laid the basis for the later Khazar-Byzantine alliance.

Gyula Németh and Paul Pelliot considered Turkic etymology for Säbir / Sabïr / Sabar / Säβir / Sävir / Savar / Sävär / Sawār / Säwēr from the root *&quot;sap-&quot; &#x27;to go astray&#x27;, i.e. the &#x27;wanderers, nomads&#x27;, placed in a group of semantically similar names: Qazar, Qazaq, Yazar, and Qačar. Al-Masudi recorded that the &quot;Khazars&quot; were named as such in Persian, while in Turkic it is &quot;Sabir&quot;, implying the same semantic meaning, and related ethnogenesis. 

However, Golden notes that root *&quot;sap-&quot;&#x27;s aorist (ending in &quot;-ar&quot;) is &quot;sapar&quot;; according to Gerard Clauson, the meanings &quot;to go astray, to deviate&quot; of root &quot;sap-&quot; ~ &quot;sep-&quot; only appeared as new words in later medieval period. Golden suggests possible derivations (though still problematic) from other roots: &quot;sav-&quot; &quot;to drive away, repulse, avoid, escape from&quot;, which fits better into the category of ethnonyms denoting nomads; or &quot;sipir-&quot; &quot;to sweep, [...] to drive out, to send away&quot;, whose derivative would mean &quot;those who sweep away [their foes]&quot;, even though the &quot;a&quot;/&quot;ä&quot; vocalization is unattested (unlike &quot;sipir-&quot; &gt; &quot;süpür-&quot;).

Walter Bruno Henning considered to have found them in the Sogdian Nafnamak (near Turpan) long after the 5th century. Some scholars related their name to the name of Siberia (e.g. Harmatta), with a far-eastern Xianbei (e.g. Pritsak) and Finno-Ugric origin (e.g. Artamonov). The ancient historians related and differed them from the Huns, implying their mixed descent.

Byzantine documents normally refer to Sabirs as &quot;Sabiroi&quot;, although the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos (908–959) writes in his &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot; that he was told by a Hungarian delegation visiting his court that the &quot;Tourkoi&quot; (the Byzantine name for the Hungarians) used to be called &quot;sabartoi asphaloi&quot;, generally considered to mean &quot;steadfast Sabirs&quot;, and still regularly sent delegations to those who stayed behind in the Caucasus region near Persia. Possibly some Hungarian group derived from the Sabirs as their name is reflected in Szavard, and personal clan name Zuard.

==History==
In 463 AD, Priscus mentions that the Sabirs attacked the Saragurs, Oghurs and Onogurs, as a result of having themselves been attacked by the Avars. It has been suggested that the nomadic motion began with the Chinese attack in 450–458 against the Rouran Khaganate. 

In 504 and 515, they held raids around the Caucasus, which was the Sasanian northern frontier during the rule of king Kavadh I, causing problems to the Persians in their war against the Byzantine Empire. It has been proposed that the 20,000 Huns led by Zilgibis were Sabirs. They made treaties with both Justin I and Kavadh I, but decided on the former, which resulted in mutual agreement between Justin I and Kavadh I, and the former devastating attack on Zilgibis and his army. 

In 520s, the Queen Boareks, widow of the Sabir chieftain Balaq (Turkic &quot;balaq&quot;) through Justinian I&#x27;s diplomacy came closer to the Byzantines, and successfully attacked two Hunnic leaders Astera/Styrax (executed in Constantinople) and Aglanos/Glones (Sasanian ally). She ruled over 100,000 people and could field 20,000 strong-men army. At the Battle of Satala (530), a mixed Persian army led by Mihr-Mihroe consisted of circa three thousand Sabirs. In December 531, many Sabirs were summoned by the Persians to plunder around Euphratesia, Cyrrhus, Cilicia, but some of the booty had been returned by the Roman magister militum.

During the Lazic War (541–562), in 548, along with the Alans they allied with Gubazes II of Lazica and conquered the Petra from the Persians. In 551, some Sabirs were allied to Bessas in the successful attempt to wrest Petra from the Persians, meanwhile, other four thousand led by Mihr-Mihroe were part of the unsuccessful siege of Archaeopolis. In 556, two thousand Sabirs served as heavy infantry mercenaries of the Byzantine Empire against the Sasanian Empire. They were led by Balmaq (Turkic &quot;barmaq&quot;, &quot;finger&quot; ), Kutilzis (Turkic &quot;*qut-il-či&quot;, with &quot;qut&quot; meaning &quot;majesty&quot;) and Iliger (Turkic &quot;Ilig-ār&quot;, &quot;prince-man&quot;). They won against the three thousand Dilimnites near Archaeopolis. Eight hundred Dilimnites were killed in a failed rush. In the same year, some five thousand Sabirs allied to the Persians were killed by three thousand Roman horsemen. 

As part of the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 572–591, in 572–573, Sabirs lost as part of the Sasanian mixed army against the Marcian near Nisibis. In 578, some eight thousand Sabirs and Arab allies were on the side of the Persians and raided territory around Resaena and Constantia.

The Syriac translation of the Pseudo-Zacharias Rhetor&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; (c. 555) in Western Eurasia recorded thirteen tribes, including the &quot;sbr&quot; (Sabir). They are described in typical phrases reserved for nomads in the ethnographic literature of the period, as people who &quot;live in tents, earn their living on the meat of livestock and fish, of wild animals and by their weapons (plunder)&quot;.

The Armenian and Arabic sources placed them in the North Caucasus, near Laks, Alans, Filān, Masqat, Sāhib as-Sarīr and the Khazar town Samandar. By the late 6th century, the coming of the Pannonian Avars into Europe terminated the Sabir union in the North Caucasus. According to Theophylact Simocatta, when the Barsils, Onogurs and Sabirs saw the invading Uar and Chunni they panicked because thought the invaders were the Avars. Menander Protector placed the events between 558 and 560. He mentioned them last time in connection with the Byzantine conquest in Caucasian Albania during the reign of Tiberius II Constantine (578–582), but the large sums were not enough to stop them to rejoin the Persians.

They were assimilated into the Khazars and Bulgars confederations. The tribe Suwāz in Volga Bulgaria is related to the city Suwār in the same state, and North Caucasian kingdom Suwār. However, it is uncertain whether these Suwār i.e. Sawâr are the Sabirs who gone to the North Caucasus and after 558 retreated to the Volga, came there as the result of the Khazar state creation, or were tribes who never went to the North Caucasus, but stopped on the Volga. Ahmad ibn Fadlan recorded that in the 10th century they still had their own leader with the title &quot;Wirgh&quot; (*&quot;Vuyrigh&quot;, Turkic &quot;Buyruq&quot;), and there were some Suwār-Bulghar hostilities.

There is no reliable information supporting the view of Mikhail Artamonov, who has claimed the intermixing of the Sabirs and Khazars was facilitated by their common Bulgar ethnicity, or that they were Turkicized Ugrians. Károly Czeglédy considered that the Khazar state was composed of three basic groups, including the Sabirs. Dieter Ludwig suggested that the Khazars were Sabirs who had formed an alliance with the Uar of Khwarezm. The intimate ties between the Hungarians and the Sabirs led Lev Gumilev to speculate that rather than Oghuric they may have been Ugric speakers (both terms being of the same etymological origin). Al-Biruni remarked that the language of the Volga Bulgars and Sawârs was &quot;compounded of Turkic and Khazar&quot;, while modern scholars like Gyula Németh, Lajos Ligeti and Peter Benjamin Golden consider that the Sabirs spoke standard Turkic rather than Oghuric Turkic.

==Legacy==
A number of Caucasian toponyms derive from their name; Šaberan, Samir, Samirkent, Sabir-xost, Sibir-don, Sivir-don, Savir, Bila-suvar, Sebir-oba, Sevare, Suvar, and as well as the subdivisions Sabar and Sabur/Sabïr of the Kyrgyzes. Chuvash historians postulate that their nation is descended from Sabirs. In the Mari language modern Volga Tatars are called ; Chuvash also are known as (which means &quot;Suar&quot;-icized Mari), or in Finnish .

<text>The Britten-Norman Trislander (more formally designated the BN-2A Mk III Trislander) is a three-engined piston-powered utility aircraft designed and produced by the British aircraft manufacturer Britten-Norman.

The Trislander was designed in the late 1960s as an expanded derivative of the company&#x27;s Islander, a twin-engined commercial aircraft that had proved to be a commercial success. In comparison to its predecessor, it had a larger carrying capacity, being capable of seating up to 18 passengers, and could also perform STOL operations when required. On 11 September 1970, the prototype Trislander performed its maiden flight; the type entered revenue service less than a year later.

Being marketed primarily as a feederliner and mostly sold to civilian operators, the Trislander was primarily manufactured at the company&#x27;s facility on the Isle of Wight between 1970 and 1982. Later on, the Trislander was also produced in Romania, and delivered via Belgium to Britain for certification. Several different commuter airlines have operated the Trislander in scheduled passenger services, the largest being the Guernsey-based operator Aurigny, which flew the type for over 40 years. Despite plans to produce the Trislander at the American manufacturer International Aviation Corporation (IAC) as the &quot;Tri-Commutair&quot;, these did not come to fruition.

==Design and development==
During the 1960s, the British aircraft manufacturer Britten-Norman, founded by John Britten and Desmond Norman, had designed and commenced production of the Islander, a twin-engined commercial aircraft that quickly proved itself to be a commercial success. Being keen to capitalise on the Islander, the company&#x27;s management opted to pursue development of a larger aircraft that would be derived from its predecessor as to benefit from commonalities and to lower development costs. In 1968, the company flew a stretched variant of the aircraft, known as the &quot;BN-2E Islander Super&quot;, however, this model was never pursued through to certification in favour of a more radical alternative design - the Trislander.
Seeking to give the aircraft a considerably larger carrying capacity, the Islander&#x27;s fuselage was stretched and strengthened considerably for the Trislander, a measure that necessitated various configuration changes The most visually apparent of these was the addition of a third engine located on the fuselage centre line atop an elongated tailfin. A fixed tricycle landing gear arrangement was also adopted. While possessing an unorthodox appearance, the arrangement proved practical; in terms of construction, the Trilander was similar enough to the Islander that the two aircraft shared the same final assembly line.

The prototype of the Trislander was constructed from the original second prototype of the Islander; it performed its maiden flight on 11 September 1970. Confidence in the type was such that it appeared at the Farnborough Air Show that same day. Britten-Norman opted to principally promote the Trislander to prospective operators as a feederliner; foreseen secondary roles included its potential use by military air services as well.

In terms of its flying characteristics, the Trislander possesses exceptional low speed handling characteristics, extended endurance, increased payload, and a relatively low noise signature. Capable of taking off from a long landing strip, the Trislander can readily operate from unprepared surfaces. It was also promoted for its economical operating costs. Some variants came equipped with auto-feathering propellers and auxiliary rocket-assisted takeoff (RATO) apparatus.

==Operational history==
During July 1971, the Trislander entered service with the Guernsey-based Aurigny, one month after the deliveries of the type had commenced. Aurigny would be the largest operator of the type, operating 16 Trislanders at its peak. In May 2017, Aurigny opted to withdraw all of its Trislanders, the type having been replaced by newer Dornier 228s. One of the ex-Aurigny Trislanders has been preserved and placed on display at the Imperial War Museum Duxford in the UK while another aircraft is displayed at Oaty &amp; Joey&#x27;s play barn at Oatlands Village in Guernsey.

Following the acquisition of Britten-Norman by the Fairey Aviation Group in August 1972 and the formation of the Fairey Britten-Norman company; the majority of manufacturing activity for both the Islander and Trislander was transferred to its Avions Fairey factory in Gosselies, Belgium. All production activity of the type in Britain ceased in 1982, by which point 73 Trilanders had been delivered while a further seven aircraft were complete but unsold; that same year, Pilatus Britten Norman sold a manufacturing license to the American manufacturer International Aviation Corporation (IAC). IAC had planned to produce an initial batch of 12 Trislanders (which were to be marketed under the name &quot;Tri-Commutair&quot;s) from parts kits supplied by Britten-Norman before undertaking full production, however, these plans ultimately came to nothing.

Into the 2020s, companies have continued to operate the Trislander; a number have been made available for private entities to hire.

==Variants==
;BN-2A Mk III-1: First production version, with short nose.

;BN-2A Mk III-2: Lengthened nose and higher operating weight.

;BN-2A Mk III-3: Variant certified for operation in the United States.

==Accidents and incidents==
On 8 October 1977, ZS-JYF, operated by Southern Aviation, impacted the ground while attempting a stall turn during an air display at Lanseria in South Africa. Despite sustaining severe damage (it was damaged beyond repair) the aircraft performed an emergency landing and neither occupant was injured.

On 25 October 1991, a Trislander operated by Bali International Air Service disappeared during an holding pattern near H. Asan Airport in Indonesia. There were 17 people on board, which were all presumed dead.

On 15 December 2008, a Trislander operated by LAP in Puerto Rico crashed into the sea somewhere near the Turks and Caicos, shortly after a distress call. A spokesman for the Asociación Nacional de Pilotos reported that the pilot had his licence suspended in October 2006.

On 5 July 2009, a Trislander belonging to Great Barrier Airlines (now Barrier Air) lost its starboard side prop six minutes into a flight from Great Barrier Island, New Zealand, to Auckland. The prop sheared off and impacted the fuselage, prompting a successful emergency landing. While there were injuries, no deaths were reported. The accident was caused by undetected corrosion of the propeller flange which led to its eventual failure.

<doc id="324681" wikidata="Q320524" url="?curid=324681" title="Metatarsal bones">
<text>The metatarsal bones or metatarsus (: metatarsi) are a group of five long bones in the midfoot, located between the tarsal bones (which form the heel and the ankle) and the phalanges (toes). Lacking individual names, the metatarsal bones are numbered from the medial side (the side of the great toe): the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth metatarsal (often depicted with Roman numerals). The metatarsals are analogous to the metacarpal bones of the hand. The lengths of the metatarsal bones in humans are, in descending order, second, third, fourth, fifth, and first. A bovine hind leg has two metatarsals.

== Structure ==
The five metatarsals are dorsal convex long bones consisting of a shaft or body, a base (proximally), and a head (distally). The body is prismoid in form, tapers gradually from the tarsal to the phalangeal extremity, and is curved longitudinally, so as to be concave below, slightly convex above. The base or posterior extremity is wedge-shaped, articulating proximally with the tarsal bones, and by its sides with the contiguous metatarsal bones: its dorsal and plantar surfaces are rough for the attachment of ligaments. The head or distal extremity presents a convex articular surface, oblong from above downward, and extending farther backward below than above. Its sides are flattened, and on each is a depression, surmounted by a tubercle, for ligamentous attachment. Its plantar surface is grooved antero-posteriorly for the passage of the flexor tendons, and marked on either side by an articular eminence continuous with the terminal articular surface.

During growth, the growth plates are located distally on the metatarsals, except on the first metatarsal where it is located proximally. Yet it is quite common to have an accessory growth plate on the distal first metatarsal.

=== Articulations ===

The base of each metatarsal bone articulates with one or more of the tarsal bones at the tarsometatarsal joints, and the head with one of the first row of phalanges at the metatarsophalangeal joints. Their bases also articulate with each other at the intermetatarsal joints

* The &quot;first&quot; metatarsal articulates with the medial cuneiform, and to a small extent to the intermediate cuneiform.
* the &quot;second&quot; with all three cuneiforms.
* the &quot;third&quot; with the lateral cuneiform.
* the &quot;fourth&quot; with the lateral cuneiform and the cuboid.
* The &quot;fifth&quot; with the cuboid.

=== Muscle attachments ===

==Clinical significance==

===Injuries===

The metatarsal bones are often broken by association football (soccer) players. These and other recent cases have been attributed to the lightweight design of modern football boots, which provide less protection to the foot. In 2010 some football players began testing a new sock that incorporated a rubber silicone pad over the foot to provide protection to the top of the foot. Stress fractures are thought to account for 16% of injuries related to sports participation, and the metatarsals are the bones most often involved. These fractures are sometimes called march fractures, based on their traditional association with military recruits after long marches. The second and third metatarsals are fixed while walking, thus these metatarsals are common sites of injury. The fifth metatarsal may be fractured if the foot is oversupinated during locomotion.

Protection from injuries can be given by the use of safety footwear which can use built-in or removable metatarsal guards.

<doc id="324682" wikidata="Q319834" url="?curid=324682" title="Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza">
<text>Pierre Paul François Camille Savorgnan de Brazza (born Pietro Paolo Savorgnan di Brazzà; 26 January 1852 – 14 September 1905) was an Italian-French explorer. With his family&#x27;s financial help, he explored the Ogooué region of Central Africa, and later with the backing of the Société de Géographie de Paris, he reached far into the interior along the right bank of the Congo River. He has often been depicted as a man of friendly manner, great charm and peaceful approach towards the Africans he met and worked with on his journeys. Under French colonial rule, the capital of the Republic of the Congo was named Brazzaville after him and the name was retained by the post-colonial rulers.

== Early years ==
Born in Rome, Pietro Savorgnan di Brazzà was the seventh of thirteen children. His father, Ascanio Savorgnan di Brazzà, was a nobleman and well known artist, from a family with ancient Friulian origins and many French connections. His mother, Giacinta Simonetti, from an old Roman family with Venetian roots, was 24 years younger than his father. From an early age, Pietro was interested in exploration, particularly in West Africa, and he won entry to the French naval school Academy of Borda at Brest. In 1870, he graduated and sailed aboard the French ironclad &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot; to Algeria, where he witnessed the bloody suppression of the Mokrani Revolt. This committed him to a philosophy of non-violence throughout his life.

== Exploration in Africa ==
Brazza first encountered Africa in 1872, while sailing on an anti-slavery mission near Gabon. His next ship was the &quot;Vénus&quot;, which stopped at Gabon regularly. In 1874, Brazza made two trips into the interior, up the Gabon and Ogooué rivers. He then proposed to the government that he explore the Ogooué to its source. With the help of friends in high places, including Jules Ferry and Leon Gambetta, he secured partial funding, the rest coming from his own pocket. He was granted French citizenship in 1874, and adopted the French spelling of his name. His efforts to gain citizenship had been aided by Louis Raymond de Montaignac de Chauvance, who acted as Brazza&#x27;s patron in the early years of his career.

In this expedition, which lasted from 1875 to 1878, &#x27;armed&#x27; only with cotton textiles and tools to use for barter, and accompanied by a medical doctor, Noel Ballay, a naturalist, Alfred Marche, his assistant, Victor Hamon, twelve Senegalese laptots, four Gabonese interpreters and his cook, Chico, the explorer made his way deep inland where no other European had ventured because of the river dwellers&#x27; resistance. But Brazza&#x27;s lack of fear and peaceful demeanor gained him the trust of the people encountered. Upon his return to Paris he was fêted as a celebrity in the French press and was courted by the French political elite as the man to advance their imperialist ambitions in Africa.

The French government authorised a second mission, which was carried out from 1879 to 1882. They had adjudged his first mission a success and felt that a mission to the Congo Basin was needed to prevent Henry M. Stanley, in the service of Leopold II of Belgium, from occupying the entire area. By following the Ogoué River upstream and proceeding overland to the Lefini River and then downstream, Brazza succeeded in reaching the Congo River in 1880 without encroaching on Portuguese claims.

Brazza then was received by King Makoko Iloo I of the Batéké in what was the most significant encounter of his career as an explorer. Brazza proposed to King Makoko that he place his kingdom under the protection of the French flag. King Makoko, aware of Stanley&#x27;s advance and interested in trade possibilities and gaining an edge over his rivals, signed the treaty. The terms of this treaty were upheld after the king&#x27;s death by his queen, Ngalifourou, who became Queen Mother and an influential figure in French colonial life. Brazza respected Ngalifourou so much that he presented her with a sabre. Makoko also arranged for the establishment of a French settlement at Mfoa on the Congo&#x27;s Malebo Pool, a place later known as Brazzaville; after Brazza&#x27;s departure, the outpost was manned by two laptots under the command of Senegalese Sergeant Malamine Camara, whose resourcefulness had impressed Brazza during their several months together trekking inland from the coast. During this trip he encountered Stanley near Vivi. Brazza did not tell Stanley that he had just signed a treaty with Makoko; it took Stanley some months to realise that he had been beaten in the &quot;race&quot; set by his sponsor, Leopold II. Brazza was again celebrated in France for his efforts. The press dubbed him &quot;le conquérant pacifique&quot;, the peaceful conqueror, for his success in ensuring French imperial expansion without waging war.

In 1883, Brazza was named the governor-general of the French Congo in 1886. He was dismissed in 1897 due to poor revenue from the colony and journalist reports of conditions for the natives that some said were &quot;too good.&quot; For his part Brazza had become disillusioned with the exploitative and repressive practices of the concessionary companies, which he had witnessed first-hand.

By 1905, stories had reached Paris of injustice, forced labour and brutality under the &quot;laissez-faire&quot; approach of the Congo&#x27;s new governor, Émile Gentil, to the new concession companies set up by the French colonial office and condoned by Prosper Philippe Augouard, Catholic Bishop of the Congo. Brazza was sent to investigate these stories and the resulting report was revealing and damning, in spite of many obstructions placed in his path. When his deputy, Félicien Challaye, put the embarrassing report before the National Assembly, the report was suppressed.

The oppressive conditions in the French Congo continued for decades.

== Personal life ==
Brazza&#x27;s younger brother, Jacques, was a mountaineer and naturalist who accompanied Pierre in Africa from 1883 to 1886. 

He married Thérèse Pineton de Chambrun (1860–1948) on 12 August 1895. They had four childrenJacques (1899–1903), Antoine, Charles and Marthe.

Brazza became a Freemason in 1888, being initiated at the Alsace-Lorraine lodge in Paris on 26 June. Nevertheless, he left the organisation in 1904, believing that the French Freemasonry had betrayed its own principles by colluding with corporations for the benefit of an inhuman colonial system.

== Death and legacy ==
In September 1905, toward the end of his &quot;Mission Extraordinaire&quot;, Brazza became sick. On the return voyage to France, when the ship docked in Dakar, a major port, he was brought to the hospital where he died at the age of 53, with his wife Thérèse at his side. His body was repatriated to France and he was given a state funeral at Sainte-Clotilde, Paris. Thérèse, who always maintained that her husband had been poisoned by the colonial authorities, refused the honour of burial in the Pantheon and buried him temporarily at the cemetery of Père Lachaise in Paris. Later, Thérèse had Brazza&#x27;s body exhumed and re-interred in Algiers (capital of present-day Algeria). The epitaph on his burial site in Algiers reads: &quot;Une mémoire pure de sang humain&quot; (&quot;a memory untainted by human blood&quot;).

In 2006, his remains were once again exhumed and removed to a mausoleum in Brazzaville.

The French Navy &quot;aviso&quot; , completed in 1933 and sold in 1957, was named for Brazza.

=== Brazzaville Mausoleum ===
In February 2005, presidents Nguesso of Congo, Ondimba of Gabon and Chirac of France gathered at a ceremony to lay the foundation stone for a memorial to Brazza, a mausoleum of Italian marble. On 30 September 2006, Brazza&#x27;s remains were exhumed in Algiers along with those of his wife and four children. They were reinterred in Brazzaville on 3 October in a new, marble mausoleum built for them at a cost of some million dollars. The reburial ceremony was attended by three African presidents and a French foreign minister, who paid tribute to Brazza&#x27;s humanitarian work against slavery and the abuse of African workers.

=== Mausoleum controversy ===
The decision to honour Brazza as a founding father of the Republic of the Congo has elicited protests among many Congolese. &quot;Mwinda Press&quot;, the journal of the Association of Congolese Democrats in France, published articles quoting Théophile Obenga who depicted Brazza as a coloniser and not a humanist. He was declared to have raped a Congolese woman, who was a princess and the equivalent of a Vestal Virgin, and to have pillaged villages, raising highly charged questions as to why the coloniser should be revered as a national hero instead of the Congolese who fought against colonisation.

=== Taxa named in Brazza&#x27;s honor ===
*The fish &quot;Enteromius brazzai&quot; . 
*The catfish &quot;Atopochilus savorgnani&quot;.

<text>In human anatomy, the metacarpal bones or metacarpus, also known as the &quot;palm bones&quot;, are the appendicular bones that form the intermediate part of the hand between the phalanges (fingers) and the carpal bones (wrist bones), which articulate with the forearm. The metacarpal bones are homologous to the metatarsal bones in the foot.

==Structure==

The metacarpals form a transverse arch to which the rigid row of distal carpal bones are fixed. The peripheral metacarpals (those of the thumb and little finger) form the sides of the cup of the palmar gutter and as they are brought together they deepen this concavity. The index metacarpal is the most firmly fixed, while the thumb metacarpal articulates with the trapezium and acts independently from the others. The middle metacarpals are tightly united to the carpus by intrinsic interlocking bone elements at their bases. The ring metacarpal is somewhat more mobile while the fifth metacarpal is semi-independent.

Each metacarpal bone consists of a body or shaft, and two extremities; the &quot;head&quot; at the distal or digital end (near the fingers), and the &quot;base&quot; at the proximal or carpal end (close to the wrist).

=== Body ===
The &quot;body&quot; (&quot;shaft&quot;) is prismoid in form, and curved, so as to be convex in the longitudinal direction behind, concave in front. It presents three surfaces: medial, lateral, and dorsal.
* The &quot;medial&quot; and &quot;lateral surfaces&quot; are concave, for the attachment of the interosseus muscles, and separated from one another by a prominent anterior ridge.
* The &quot;dorsal surface&quot; presents in its distal two-thirds a smooth, triangular, flattened area which is covered in by the tendons of the extensor muscles. This surface is bounded by two lines, which commence in small tubercles situated on either side of the digital extremity, and, passing upward, converge and meet some distance above the center of the bone and form a ridge which runs along the rest of the dorsal surface to the carpal extremity. This ridge separates two sloping surfaces for the attachment of the &quot;interossei dorsales&quot;.
* To the tubercles on the digital extremities are attached the collateral ligaments of the metacarpophalangeal joints.

=== Base ===
The &quot;base&quot; (&quot;basis&quot;) or &quot;carpal extremity&quot; is of a cuboidal form, and broader behind than in front. It articulates with the carpal bones and with the adjoining metacarpal bones while its dorsal and volar surfaces are rough, for the attachment of ligaments.

=== Head ===
The &quot;head&quot; (&quot;caput&quot;) or &quot;digital extremity&quot; presents an oblong surface markedly convex from before backward, less so transversely, and flattened from side to side; it articulates with the proximal phalanx. It is broader, and extends farther upward, on the volar than on the dorsal aspect, and is longer in the antero-posterior than in the transverse diameter. On either side of the head is a tubercle for the attachment of the collateral ligament of the metacarpophalangeal joint.

The dorsal surface, broad and flat, supports the tendons of the extensor muscles.

The volar surface is grooved in the middle line for the passage of the flexor tendons, and marked on either side by an articular eminence continuous with the terminal articular surface.

=== Neck===
The neck, or &quot;subcapital&quot; segment, is the transition zone between the body and the head.

=== Articulations ===
Besides the metacarpophalangeal joints, the metacarpal bones articulate by carpometacarpal joints as follows:
# the first with the trapezium;
# the second with the trapezium, trapezoid, capitate and third metacarpal;
# the third with the capitate and second and fourth metacarpals;
# the fourth with the capitate, hamate, and third and fifth metacarpals;
# and the fifth with the hamate and fourth metacarpal;
=== Insertions ===
&quot;Extensor Carpi Radialis Longus/Brevis&quot;: Both insert on the base of metacarpal II; Assist with wrist extension and radial flexion of the wrist

&quot;Extensor Carpi Ulnaris&quot;: Inserts on the base of metacarpal V; Extends and fixes wrist when digits are being flexed; assists with ulnar flexion of wrist

&quot;Abductor Pollicis Longus&quot;: Inserts on the trapezium and base of metacarpal I; Abducts thumb in frontal plane; extends thumb at carpometacarpal joint

&quot;Opponens Pollicis&quot;: Inserts on metacarpal I; flexes metacarpal I to oppose the thumb to the fingertips

&quot;Opponens digiti minimi&quot;: Inserts on the medial surface of metacarpal V; Flexes metacarpal V at carpometacarpal joint when little finger is moved into opposition with tip of thumb; deepens palm of hand.
==Clinical significance==

=== Congenital disorders ===
The fourth and fifth metacarpal bones are commonly &quot;blunted&quot; or shortened, in pseudohypoparathyroidism and pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism.

A blunted fourth metacarpal, with normal fifth metacarpal, can signify Turner syndrome.

Blunted metacarpals (particularly the fourth metacarpal) are a symptom of nevoid basal-cell carcinoma syndrome.

===Fracture===
The neck of a metacarpal is a common location for a boxer&#x27;s fracture, but all parts of the metacarpal bone (including head, body and base) are susceptible to fracture. During their lifetime, 2.5% of individuals will experience at least one metacarpal fracture. Bennett&#x27;s fracture (base of the thumb) is the most common. Several types of treatment exist ranging from non-operative techniques, with or without immobilization, to operative techniques using closed or open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). Generally, most fractures showing little or no displacement can be treated successfully without surgery. Intraarticular fracture-dislocations of the metacarpal head or base may require surgical fixation, as fragment displacement affecting the joint surface is rarely tolerated well.

== Other animals ==
In four-legged animals, the metacarpals form part of the forefeet, and are frequently reduced in number, appropriate to the number of toes. In digitigrade and unguligrade animals, the metacarpals are greatly extended and strengthened, forming an additional segment to the limb, a feature that typically enhances the animal&#x27;s speed. In both birds and bats, the metacarpals form part of the wing.

==History==

===Etymology===
The Greek physician Galen used to refer to the as μετακάρπιον. The Latin form more truly resembles its Ancient Greek predecessor μετακάρπιον than metacarpus. Meta– is Greek for beyond and carpal from Ancient Greek &quot;καρπός&quot; (, “wrist”).
In anatomic Latin, adjectives like , , , , and can be found. The form is more true to the later Greek form μετακάρπιος. , as in in the current official Latin nomenclature, &quot;Terminologia Anatomica&quot; is a compound consisting of Latin and Greek parts. The usage of such hybrids in anatomic Latin is disapproved by some.

<doc id="324711" wikidata="Q447776" url="?curid=324711" title="Ignacio Ramonet">
<text>Ignacio Ramonet Miguez (born 5 May 1943) is a Spanish academic, journalist, and writer who has been based in Paris for much of his career. After becoming first known for writing on film and media, he became editor-in-chief of &quot;Le Monde diplomatique&quot;, serving from 1991 until March 2008. Under his leadership, LMD established editorial independence in 1996 from &quot;Le Monde&quot;, with which it had been affiliated since 1954.

Ramonet published an editorial in December 1997 in &quot;Le Monde diplomatique&quot; on the Tobin tax that led to the launching of ATTAC. This is an activist organization promoting taxation of foreign exchange transactions. Ramonet is one of the founders of the non-governmental organization Media Watch Global, and its president. He frequently contributes to &quot;El País&quot;, among other media, and participates in an advisory council to the Venezuelan network Telesur.

==Life==
Ramonet was born in Redondela (Pontevedra), Spain, in 1943. He went to Tangier, Morocco, to study engineering. He continued these studies at Bordeaux, Rabat and Paris. In Paris he earned a PhD in Semiology and the History of Culture, at Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences)- EHESS, one of the French Grande Écoles.

Ramonet has been a professor of Communication Theory at Paris Diderot University. He also taught at the Paris Diderot University. He first started writing journalism as a film critic and writer about film for various magazines. Ramonet later wrote more frequently about media culture, communications, and national affairs, becoming associated with &quot;Le Monde Diplomatique&quot;, started in 1954 as a monthly publication associated with the newspaper.

Ranomet was elected as editor-in-chief in January 1991, serving to March 2008. Under his leadership, the magazine became editorially independent of &quot;Le Monde&quot; in 1996. It has been an independent critic outside academia of media culture and its ties to national society. In 2007, Ramonet participated in the Stock Exchange of Visions project.

==Opinions==
===Socialism===
Ramonet says that it is a betrayal of socialism for some social democrat parties to have chosen the Third Way between socialism and capitalism.

====Fidel Castro====
In May 2004, Ramonet supported Castro when Castro disputed the claim by &quot;Forbes&quot; that he was the seventh wealthiest head of state. In 2006, after Castro had retired from public life, Ramonet praised Castro&#x27;s legacy in a series of articles in &quot;Foreign Policy&quot;. He said reforms under Castro &quot;have proceeded from a popular movement in which the hopes of peasants, workers, and even professionals from the small urban bourgeoisie have converged&quot;. He was approved as Castro&#x27;s only authorised biographer. In September 2006, Ramonet published &quot;Fidel Castro : Biografía a Dos Voces&quot;.

===Against globalization and neoliberalism===
Ramonet has called for autarky and for regulation, taxes and tariffs that reduce international trade.

==ATTAC==
According to Ramonet, globalization and neoliberalism threaten the sovereignty of national states. In his December 1997 editorial &quot;Disarming the Markets&quot;, Ramonet attributed the Asian economic crisis to globalization, and said that it threatened the identity of national states. To counter this, he called for an NGO to promote the Tobin tax on foreign exchange. He became a founder of Association for the Taxation of Financial Transactions and for Citizens&#x27; Action (ATTAC).

<doc id="324717" wikidata="Q519254" url="?curid=324717" title="Fort William Henry">
<text>Fort William Henry was a British fort at the southern end of Lake George, in the province of New York. The fort&#x27;s construction was ordered by Sir William Johnson in September 1755, during the French and Indian War, as a staging ground for attacks against the French position at Fort St. Frédéric. It was part of a chain of British and French forts along the important inland waterway from New York City to Montreal, and occupied a key forward location on the frontier between New York and New France. In 1757, the French general Louis-Joseph de Montcalm conducted a successful siege that forced the British to surrender. The Huron warriors who accompanied the French army subsequently killed many of the British prisoners. The siege and massacre were portrayed in James Fenimore Cooper&#x27;s novel &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;.

The fort was named for both Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, the younger son of King George II, and Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, a grandson of King George II and a younger brother of the future King George III. After the 1757 siege, the French destroyed the fort and withdrew. While other forts were built nearby in later years, the site of Fort William Henry lay abandoned for two centuries. In the 19th century, the ruins of the fort became a destination for tourists. Interest in the history of the site revived in the 1950s, and a replica of the fort was constructed. It is now operated as a living museum and a popular tourist attraction in the village of Lake George.

==Construction==
In 1755, Sir William Johnson, British Indian Supervisor of the Northeast, established a military camp at the southern end of Lake George, with the objective of launching an attack on Fort St. Frédéric, a French fort at Crown Point on Lake Champlain. The French commander, Baron Dieskau, decided to launch a preemptive attack on Johnson&#x27;s support base at Fort Edward on the Hudson River. Their movements precipitated the British victory in the Battle of Lake George on September 8, 1755, part of which was fought on the ground of Johnson&#x27;s Lake George camp. Following the battle, Johnson decided to construct a fortification near the site, while the French began construction of Fort Carillon near the northern end of the lake.

Design and construction of the new fortification was overseen by British military engineer William Eyre of the 44th Foot. Fort William Henry was an irregular square fortification with bastions on the corners, in a design that was intended to repel Indian attacks, but not necessarily withstand attack from an enemy armed with artillery. Its walls were thick, with log facings around an earthen filling. Inside the fort were wooden barracks two stories high, built around the parade ground. Its magazine was in the northeast bastion, and its hospital was located in the southeast bastion. The fort was surrounded on three sides by a dry moat, with the fourth side sloping down to the lake. The only access to the fort was by a bridge across the moat. The fort could house 400 to 500 men; additional troops were quartered in an entrenched camp southeast of the fort, near the site of the 1755 Battle of Lake George.

==Occupation==
The fort was ready for occupancy, if not fully complete, on November 13, 1755. Eyre served as its first commander, with a garrison consisting of companies from his 44th, as well as several companies of Rogers&#x27; Rangers.

In the spring of 1757, command of the fort was turned over to George Monro, with a garrison principally drawn from the 35th Foot and the 60th (Royal American) Foot. By June the garrison had swollen to about 1,600 men with the arrival of provincial militia companies from Connecticut and New Jersey. Because the fort was too small to quarter this many troops, many of them were stationed in Johnson&#x27;s old camp to the southwest of the fort. When word arrived in late July that the French had mobilized to attack the fort, another 1,000 regulars and militia arrived, swelling Monro&#x27;s force to about 2,300 effective troops. Johnson&#x27;s camp, where many were quartered, was quickly protected by the digging of trenches. Conditions in both the fort and the camp were not good, and many men were ill, including some with smallpox.

==Siege==

In February of 1757, the Governor-General in Canada, or New France, Pierre de Rigaud, marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnial sent about 1500 men south to attack Fort William Henry. The initial French attack failed.

A renewed stronger French attack was initiated in the summer of 1757. On August 3, 1757, a force commanded by General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm arrived and established camps to the south and the west of the fort. The French forces totaled some 8,000, consisting of 3,000 regulars, 3,000 militia and nearly 2,000 Native Americans from various tribes, more than double the British forces. French siege operations included heavy bombardment by cannon from opposite sides of the fort that alternated as one side bombarded while the other side dug new defensive trenches that grew closer and closer to the fort&#x27;s walls. Over the six-day siege, the fort&#x27;s cannons began breaking down and running low on ammunition. British Colonel Monro hoped and expected reinforcements from General Daniel Webb, who commanded Fort Edward, to the south. Despite Monro&#x27;s pleas for help sent by messenger, Webb declined to send reinforcements for fear that the large French force would attack Fort Edward next. On August 8, the British surrendered the fort after they negotiated terms with the French that permitted the British to withdraw to Fort Edward under French protection, leave their ammunition at the fort, and agree to take no further part in the war until they had been properly exchanged. The British forces were allowed full honours of war, could keep their colours, muskets with no ammunition, and a single symbolic cannon. The fort would be turned over to the French. The British authorities were to release French prisoners within three months. The explicit terms of surrender were signed by both Montcalm and Monro.

France&#x27;s Indian allies began plundering the fort almost immediately and killing the sick and wounded British. As surrendering British troops and associated civilians, including about 100 women, left for the march to Fort Edward, they were attacked by Indian troops. France&#x27;s Indian allies first took the British weapons and possessions. Warriors then began seizing persons at the rear of the column and killed and scalped them. The column dissolved as some British tried to escape the onslaught by fleeing into the woods, and others tried to defend themselves. The promised French protection failed to materialize. All of the women and the children were killed, along with many British and militia soldiers. Estimates of the numbers captured, wounded, or killed have varied widely between 200 and 1,500. The lowest estimate of missing and dead ranges from 69 to 184 (at most 7.5%) of the 2,308 who had surrendered to the French. Dodge&#x27;s estimate, based upon contemporaneous diaries, letters, and reports, is that 429 of the fort&#x27;s 2300 occupants reached Fort Edward, and 406 were killed (97 during the siege and 308 during the massacre), with 536 persons &quot;missing,&quot; and 929 taken prisoner. Another history puts British losses at &quot;upwards of 700.&quot;

The Indians killed occupants of the fort and the unarmed British soldiers whom the French had allowed to leave the fort, as well as women, children, and British-affiliated Native Americans. Rufus Putnam described the tragedy in his memoirs: &quot;The Indians fell on them, and a most horrid butchery ensued, those who escaped with their lives were stripped almost naked, many in making their escape were lost in the woods where they wandered for several days without food, one man in particular was out ten days and there is reason to believe some perished, in particular the wounded...&quot;

In the 1990s, forensic anthropologists excavated human remains at Fort William Henry. They found &quot;extensive evidence of this massacre, documenting the fact that atrocities were committed&quot;, such as beheadings, mutilations (&quot;including genital mutilations&quot;), and disemboweling. The lead anthropologist stated that &quot;a lot of the soldiers [they] found died from blows to the head&quot;.

==Abandonment==

After the siege, the French systematically destroyed the fort before returning to Fort Carillon. The site lay abandoned for 200 years until a replica fort was reconstructed in the 1950s. During the production of the 1992 epic war film &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;, a $1 million copy of Fort William Henry was built on Lake James in western North Carolina.

<text>Voyager Point is a small suburb, in South Western Sydney in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Voyager Point is located 25 kilometres (35 min) south of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Liverpool. The only adjacent suburbs are Sandy Point, Holsworthy and Pleasure Point. Milperra, Panania and East Hills are located on the opposite bank of the Georges River. In the , Voyager Point recorded a population of 1,678 people.

==History==
Voyager Point takes its name from the commemorative park which was established following the loss of HMAS &quot;Voyager&quot; with the loss of 82 lives after the destroyer collided with the aircraft carrier HMAS &quot;Melbourne&quot; in February 1964. This area was formerly the East Hills Naval Estate, which contained about 70 married quarters for families of members in the Royal Australian Navy. This suburb also housed refugees from 1954 many of whom who had fled concentration and refugee camps in Australia.

==Heritage listings==
Voyager Point has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Creekwood Reserve: Lucas Watermills Archaeological Sites

==Landmarks==
The area includes many native flora, fauna and walkways through the bushland areas. A footbridge across the Georges River connects the suburb to East Hills, near Henry Lawson Drive. The Avenue is the only access road into the suburb from Heathcote Road.

==Streets==
The original streets in the suburb, such as Torch and Pelorus, were named after ships of the Second Fleet. The suburb is a relatively new development by Delfin Lend Lease on land formerly belonging to Holsworthy Barracks. A 2nd development was released in the early 2010s released by Defence Housing Australia in the North West Corner.

<text>The Bulletin was an Australian weekly magazine based in Sydney and first published in 1880. It featured politics, business, poetry, fiction and humour, alongside cartoons and other illustrations.

&quot;The Bulletin&quot; exerted significant influence on Australian culture and politics, emerging as &quot;Australia&#x27;s most popular magazine&quot; by the late 1880s. Jingoistic, xenophobic, anti-imperialist and republican, it promoted the idea of an Australian national identity distinct from its British colonial origins. Described as &quot;the bushman&#x27;s bible&quot;, &quot;The Bulletin&quot; helped cultivate a mythology surrounding the Australian bush, with bush poets such as Henry Lawson and Banjo Paterson contributing many of their best known works to the publication. After federation in 1901, &quot;The Bulletin&quot; changed owners multiple times and gradually became more conservative in its views while remaining an &quot;organ of Australianism&quot;. Although its popularity declined after World War I, it continued to serve as a vital outlet for new Australian literature.

It was revived as a modern news magazine in the 1960s, and after merging with the Australian edition of &quot;Newsweek&quot; in 1984 was retitled &quot;The Bulletin with Newsweek&quot;. Its final issue was published in January 2008, making &quot;The Bulletin&quot; Australia&#x27;s longest running magazine.

==Early history==

&quot;The Bulletin&quot; was founded by J. F. Archibald and John Haynes in Sydney, New South Wales, with the first issue being published on 31 January 1880. The original content of &quot;The Bulletin&quot; consisted of a mix of political comment, sensationalised news, and Australian literature. For a short period in 1880, their first artist William Macleod was also a partner.

The publication was folio size and initially consisted of eight pages, increasing to 12 pages in July 1880, and had reached 48 pages by 1899. The first issue sold for four pence, later reduced to three pence, and then, in 1883, was increased to six pence. It is the namesake of the Sydney lane Bulletin Place, where the journal was published between 1880 and 1897, the year it moved to newer and larger offices in George Street.

During its first few decades, &quot;The Bulletin&quot; played a significant role in fostering nationalist sentiments in Australia. Its politics were also anti-imperialist, protectionist, insular, racist, republican, anti-clerical and masculinist—but not socialist. It mercilessly ridiculed colonial governors, capitalists, perceived snobs and social climbers, the clergy, wowsers (puritanical moralists), feminists and prohibitionists. It upheld trade unionism, Australian independence, advanced democracy and White Australia. It ran cartoons mocking the British, Chinese, Japanese, Indians, Jews, and Indigenous Australians. &quot;The Bulletin&quot; decried the mistreatment of Indigenous people and regretted that, apart from the perpetrators of the Myall Creek massacre, offending colonists had escaped justice. Even so, &quot;The Bulletin&quot; assumed that their &quot;black brothers&quot; would soon die out regardless, viewing them as an inferior race unfit &quot;for the ordeal of civilisation&quot;, and any efforts to ameliorate their condition as futile. In the early 20th century, editor James Edmond changed &quot;The Bulletin&quot;″s nationalist banner from &quot;Australia for Australians&quot; to &quot;Australia for the White Man&quot;. An 1887 editorial laid out its reasons for choosing such banners:

===The &quot;Bulletin School&quot;===

From its outset, &quot;The Bulletin&quot; aimed to serve as a platform for young and aspiring Australian writers to showcase their works to large audiences. In 1886, it opened to submissions from all readers, calling for &quot;original political, social or humorous matter, unpublished anecdotes and paragraphs, poems and short stories&quot;. Archibald encouraged contributors to &quot;Make it short! Make it snappy, make it crisp, boil it down to a paragraph!&quot; This resulted in what became known as &quot;Bulletinese&quot;, described by P. R. Stephensen as &quot;a clipped kind of slangy jargon [that] laid on local colour, not with a brush, but with a trowel.&quot; &quot;The Bulletin&quot; subsequently became the focal point of an emerging literary nationalism known as the &quot;Bulletin School&quot;, characterised by colloquial Australian language, energetic verse, dry humour and hard-edged realism. Popular with people who lived in the Australian bush, &quot;The Bulletin&quot; frequently reflected the life of the bush back to them, and by 1888, it was widely referred to as &quot;the bushman&#x27;s bible&quot;. &quot;&quot;The Bulletin&quot; brought the world to the bush, and made the bush part of the world&quot;, wrote Ann Curthoys and Julianne Schultz. It was unique for publishing the contributions of ordinary bush people side by side with those from professional writers, and among folklorists and linguists, it is said to be without comparison as a source of Australianisms and bush lore.

Critics of the Bulletin School found much of its output to be amoral, pessimistic and parochial. Vincent Buckley alleged that it was &quot;a debilitating force in Australian culture&quot; that &quot;saw men as no different from, and with no more soul than, the gibber-plains, mulga, soil erosion, crows, dead sheep and withered outback mountains which regularly appeared in their poems.&quot; The journal &quot;Australian Woman&#x27;s Sphere&quot;, published by suffragist Vida Goldstein, wrote that there were two types of Bulletin School verse: &quot;one a clothes-horse on which to hang bush terms, and the other an echo from the grave, with blighted love and regret in it&quot;. While commending the Bulletin School for being &quot;racy of the soil&quot; and displaying &quot;unconventional local genius&quot;, Arthur Patchett Martin considered the defects of their verse to be &quot;an absence of lucidity and an excess of expletives&quot;. English poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson read some Bulletin School poetry but declined to finish it, saying, &quot;Unlike John the Baptist, I cannot live on locusts and wild honey.&quot;

A number of leading members of the Bulletin School, often called bush poets, have become giants of Australian literature. Notable writers associated with &quot;The Bulletin&quot; during this period include:
* Francis Adams
* Julian Ashton
* William Astley
* Barbara Baynton
* George Lewis Becke
* Randolph Bedford
* Barcroft Boake
* E. J. Brady
* Christopher Brennan
* Victor Daley
* Frank Dalby Davison
* C. J. Dennis
* Albert Dorrington
* Edward Dyson
* John Farrell
* Ernest Favenc
* Joseph Furphy
* Mary Gilmore
* C. A. Jeffries (&quot;Jeff&quot;)
* Henry Lawson
* Pattie Lewis (&quot;Mab&quot;)
* Louise Mack
* Dorothy Mackellar
* Harry Morant (&quot;The Breaker&quot;) 
* John Shaw Neilson
* Will H. Ogilvie
* Nettie Palmer
* Vance Palmer
* Andrew Barton Paterson (&quot;Banjo&quot;)
* Katherine Susannah Prichard
* Roderic Quinn
* Steele Rudd
* Alfred Stephens
* Douglas Stewart
* Ethel Turner
* Alexina Maude Wildman
* David McKee Wright

Although cartooning featured in earlier Australian newspapers and journals, &quot;The Bulletin&quot; was the first to place heavy emphasis on it, and in the estimation of Bernard Smith, helped make Australia &quot;one of the most important centres of black-and-white art in the world&quot;. Many artists contributed illustrations to &quot;The Bulletin&quot;, including:

* Jimmy Bancks
* Les Dixon
* Ambrose Dyson
* Will Dyson
* Albert Henry Fullwood
* Alexander George Gurney
* Hal Gye
* Livingston Hopkins
* George Washington Lambert

* Unk White
===Cultural impact===

According to &quot;The Times&quot; of London, &quot;It was &quot;The Bulletin&quot; that educated Australia up to Federation&quot;. In South Africa, Cecil Rhodes regarded &quot;The Bulletin&quot; with &quot;holy horror&quot; and as a threat to his imperialist ambitions. In a piece on Rhodes, W. T. Stead wrote that &quot;&quot;The Bulletin&quot; he thus honoured by his dread is indeed one of the most notable journals of the world&quot;: &quot;It is brilliant, lawless, audacious, scoffing, cynical, fearless, insolent, cocksure&quot;. English author D. H. Lawrence felt that &quot;The Bulletin&quot; was &quot;the only periodical in the world that really amused him&quot;, and often referred to it for inspiration when writing his 1923 novel &quot;Kangaroo&quot;. Like Lawrence, the novel&#x27;s English narrator considers it &quot;the momentaneous life of the continent&quot;, and appreciates its straightforwardness and the &quot;kick&quot; in its writing: &quot;It beat no solemn drums. It had no deadly earnestness. It was just stoical and spitefully humorous.&quot; In &quot;The Australian Language&quot; (1946), Sidney Baker wrote: &quot;Perhaps never again will so much of the true nature of a country be caught up in the pages of a single journal&quot;.

Bulletin School writers Henry Lawson, Mary Gilmore, and Banjo Paterson are among the four historical figures who have been commemorated on the Australian ten-dollar note.

===&quot;A Woman&#x27;s Letter&quot;===
The &quot;Bulletin&quot; was seen to be lacking a &quot;gossip column&quot; such as that conducted by &quot;Mrs Gullett&quot; in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. W. H. Traill, part-owner of the &quot;Bulletin&quot;, was aware of the literary talents of his sister-in-law Pattie Lewis, who had been, as &quot;Mab&quot;, writing children&#x27;s stories for the &quot;Sydney Mail&quot;. He offered the 17-year-old a column to be called &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Letter&quot;, which involved reporting on the comings and goings of notable Sydney socialites.
In time the column became quite popular, and reportedly the first item looked for in the magazine by both men and women.
When Lewis married, it was she who recommended her successor, Ina Wildman, the audacious &quot;Sappho Smith&quot;.
Seven women wrote the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Letter&quot; for &quot;The Bulletin&quot;:
*1881–1888 Pattie Lewis (died 1955) as &quot;Mab&quot;; married James Fotheringhame in 1886
*1888–1896: Ina Wildman (died 1896) as &quot;Sappho Smith&quot; 
*1896–1898: Florence Blair (died 1937), daughter of David Blair, she married Archibald Boteler Baverstock in 1898.
*1898–1901: Louise Mack (1870–1935) married John Percy Creed in 1896 and Allen I. Leyland in 1927.
*1901–1911: Agnes Conor O&#x27;Brien (died 1934) as &quot;Akenehi&quot; or &quot;Lynette&quot;. She married artist and newspaperman William Macleod in 1911 
*1911–1919: Margaret Cox-Taylor (died July 1939) as &quot;Vandorian&quot; 
*1919–1934: Nora Kelly as &quot;Nora McAuliffe&quot;

==Later era==

&quot;The Bulletin&quot; continued to support the creation of a distinctive Australian literature into the 20th century, most notably under the editorship of Samuel Prior (1915–1933), who created the first novel competition.

The literary character of &quot;The Bulletin&quot; continued until 1961, when it was bought by Australian Consolidated Press (ACP), merged with the &quot;Observer&quot; (another ACP publication), and shifted to a news magazine format. Donald Horne was appointed as chief editor and quickly removed &quot;Australia for the White Man&quot; from the banner. The magazine was costing ACP more than it made, but they accepted that price &quot;for the prestige of publishing Australia&#x27;s oldest magazine&quot;. Kerry Packer, in particular, had a personal liking for the magazine and was determined to keep it alive.

In 1974, as a result of its publication of a leaked Australian Security Intelligence Organisation paper discussing Deputy Prime Minister Jim Cairns, the Whitlam government called the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security.

In the 1980s and 1990s, &quot;The Bulletin&quot;″s &quot;ageing subscribers were not being replaced and its newsstand visibility had dwindled&quot;. Trevor Kennedy convinced publisher Richard Walsh to return to the magazine. Walsh promoted Lyndall Crisp to be its first female editor, but James Packer then advocated that former &quot;60 Minutes&quot; executive producer Gerald Stone be made editor-in-chief. Later, in December 2002, Kerry Packer anointed Garry Linnell as editor-in-chief. The magazine by this stage was dropping in circulation and running at a loss. On one occasion, Kerry Packer called Linnell to his office, and, when Linnell asked what Packer wanted for &quot;The Bulletin&quot;, Packer said: &quot;Son, just make &#x27;em talk about it.&quot; When former Prime Minister Paul Keating sent Linnell a letter criticising the magazine and calling it &quot;rivettingly mediocre&quot;, Linnell published the letter in the magazine, promoted that &quot;Paul Keating Writes for Us&quot;, and awarded Keating with &quot;Letter of the Week&quot;, with the prize for that being a year&#x27;s subscription to the magazine. In 2005, Linnell offered a $1.25-million reward to anyone who found an extinct Tasmanian tiger.

Kerry Packer died in 2005, and in 2007 James Packer sold controlling interest in the Packer media assets (PBL Media) to the private equity firm CVC Asia Pacific. On 24 January 2008, ACP Magazines announced that it was shutting &quot;The Bulletin&quot;. Circulation had declined from its 1990s&#x27; levels of over 100,000 down to 57,000, which has been attributed in part to readers preferring the internet as their source for news and current affairs.

<text>In &quot;Star Trek&quot; a replicator is a machine that can create (and recycle) things. Replicators were originally seen to simply synthesize meals on demand, but in later series much larger non-food items appear. The technical aspects of replicated versus &quot;real&quot; things is sometimes a plot element.

==Origins and limitations==

Although previous sci-fi writers had speculated about the development of &quot;replicating&quot; or &quot;duplicating&quot; technology, the term &quot;replicator&quot; was not itself used until &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. In simple terms, it was described as a 24th century advancement from the 23rd century &quot;food synthesizer&quot; seen in &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;. In &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;, food was created in various colored cubes. In &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot; (1974), various types of realistic-looking food could be requested, as in the episode entitled &quot;The Practical Joker&quot;. The mechanics of these devices were never clearly explained on that show. The subsequent prequel series, &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, set in the 22nd century, featured a &quot;protein resequencer&quot; that could only replicate certain foods, so an actual chef served on board who used a hydroponic greenhouse where fruits and vegetables were grown. Additionally, that ship had a &quot;bio-matter resequencer&quot; which was used to recycle waste product into usable material.

According to an academic thesis: &quot;The so-called &#x27;replicators&#x27; can reconstitute matter and produce everything that is needed out of pure energy, no matter whether food, medicaments, or spare parts are required.&quot; A replicator can create any inanimate matter, as long as the desired molecular structure is on file, but it cannot create antimatter, dilithium, latinum, and (in the case of at least federation replicators) living things of any kind; for the last case, non-canon works such as the &quot;Star Trek: the Next Generation Technical Manual&quot; state that, though the replicators share the same technology with transporters, the resolution used is too low to create living tissue. However, other replicators, such as the ones used by the aliens in the TNG episode &quot;Allegiance&quot;, could create living things, including the brain&#x27;s many trillions of dendritic connections where memory is stored.

==Uses==
One of the most important pieces of technology in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe, the replicator is used primarily to provide food and water on board starships, thus eliminating the need to stock most provisions (though starships, starbases, and other installations still stock some provisions for emergencies, such as in cases of replicator failure or an energy crisis.) On &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, it was established that as long as there is an energy source to power life support, replication is used to provide breathable air on ships and starbases (and to disassemble the carbon dioxide exhaled by the crew), thus providing a seemingly endless supply of oxygen and eliminating the need to carry air tanks.

The technology is also used for producing spare parts, which makes it possible to repair most ship damage without having to return to a starbase. Other applications include replication of Starfleet uniforms and everyday objects such as toys and souvenirs. Replication is also used by the Holodeck program to allow food, clothes, and other objects belonging within a simulation to be used or consumed by the participants.

Starfleet&#x27;s safety protocols prevent unauthorized replication of dangerous objects, such as weapons and poisonous substances.

Replicators can also convert matter into energy. Following that principle, the device can dismantle any object into subatomic particles. The ensuing energy can then be stored for future use or immediately applied in a subsequent replication. This process is referred to as &quot;recycling&quot;, and is applied to everything from dirty dishes to outgrown children&#x27;s clothes.

Replicator technology, even if produced on a larger scale, had not been able to be used to create complex objects such as shuttlecraft or starships (the production staff felt that being able to replicate entire starships &quot;at the push of a button&quot; would severely impact dramatic potential). However, in the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;For the Cause&quot;, industrial replicators are used to replicate large components of ships, shuttlecraft, and other pieces of this sort, which are later used in shipyards to construct such vessels. In this manner, as few as 15 industrial replicators are enough to replicate the components needed to build a fleet of starships or to help a civilization recover from a planet-wide natural disaster.

This ability to reproduce complex machines is furthered during the first season of &quot;Star Trek: Prodigy&quot;. A replicator is shown to have the capacity to replicate an entire starship in the second episode, &quot;Lost &amp; Found&quot;, when Gwyn is attempting to escape the Protostar. When she reaches the shuttle bay, she finds a replicator with the technology to manufacture a complete ship. The process by which it is replicated takes minutes rather than seconds though, and behaves more similarly to a 3D printer than a traditional replicator.

By virtually eliminating material scarcity, replicator technology plays an important role in the moneyless human economy within the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe.

==&quot;Voyager&quot;==
When the USS &quot;Voyager&quot; was pulled to the Delta Quadrant, it became clear that replicator technology was unknown to some of the indigenous peoples of that region. Throughout the first seasons, the Kazon and other races tried repeatedly to obtain the technology.

In the Voyager episode &quot;State of Flux&quot;, how the Kazon aliens obtain the technology from the USS Voyager, is a major plot point in the episode.

Captain Janeway feared that if this technology were acquired by a civilization before they were ready, disastrous consequences could ensue. For this reason, and because of the Prime Directive, Janeway refused to give away the technology at any price.

Also on &quot;Voyager&quot;, the ship&#x27;s energy constraints on the journey back to the Alpha Quadrant meant that replicator supplies had to be strictly controlled, leading to &quot;replicator rations&quot; becoming an unofficial ship currency. This is also the reason Neelix (aside from providing the crew with a morale boost through the preparation of fresh food) became employed as the ship&#x27;s chef. Some ingredients came from the ship&#x27;s hydroponics laboratory.

==In the real world==
In 2014, researchers at Nestlé were reported as working on technology comparable to the replicator, with the goal of providing food tailored to an individual&#x27;s nutritional requirements.

Imperial College London physicists have discovered how to create matter from light — a feat thought impossible when the idea was first hypothesized in the 1930s. In just one day in Imperial&#x27;s Blackett Physics Laboratory, three physicists worked out a relatively simple way to physically prove a theory first devised by scientists Breit and Wheeler in 1934.

BeeHex, an Ohio startup company, received a grant in 2013 from NASA intended for developing long-spaceflight food 3D printing technology. They now build food printing robots for eventual public use.

Cemvita Factory Inc., a biotech startup based in Houston, TX, is also developing a photobioreactor that converts carbon dioxide that&#x27;s captured from air along with hydrogen from hydrolyzing water to nutrients and pharmaceutics.

== Reception ==
A 2016 article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; noted that replicators may be a &quot;metaphor for the distant endpoint of the Industrial Revolution&quot;. They point out that technology as presented in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; changes the moral equation of being human, because nearly anything you want can be created with a request.

They note that Captain Picard&#x27;s favorite beverage, Earl Grey tea, is created by the replicator, and the character often states &quot;Tea, Earl Grey, Hot&quot; during the television show. The beverage is then seen being produced in the replicator with a special visual and sound effect.

<text>Raphael Vincent &quot;Ray&quot; Taliaferro (February 7, 1939 – November or December 2018) was an American radio host and political commentator. He joined KGO News Talk AM 810 (San Francisco) in 1977. In 1986, his talk show moved to the 1 to 5 a.m. early-morning time slot (Monday through Friday) and continued until December 2, 2011.

==Early life==
Taliaferro was born in Queens, New York City, on February 7, 1939. His parents were Robert Winston Taliaferro (1904-1989, born in New York City) and Florence Durden Taliaferro (born c. 1915 in Georgia), with siblings Naomi Rosetta Taliaferro (1934-2001) and Robert Nathaniel Taliaferro (1937-2004).

In 1954–1955, Ray (a high school Junior) and his brother Robert (&quot;Bob&quot;, a Senior) were attending Monterey Bay Academy (&quot;MBA&quot;) in Watsonville, California (their family lived in San Francisco at the time). MBA is a private Christian highschool for boarding and day students, of the Seventh-day Adventist denomination. Ray and Robert were members of a singing quartet called the &quot;Cosmopolitans&quot;.

Taliaferro grew up in the Hunters Point district of San Francisco. An accomplished musician, he conducted the &quot;Ray Tal Chorale&quot; and served as director of music for the Third Baptist Church.

==Broadcast career==
Taliaferro was an on-air personality for KGO NEWSTALK AM 810. His principal role was as the host of a Monday through Friday phone-in radio talk show that aired between 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. The program was simply known as the &quot;Early Show&quot; and primarily consisted of lively (and sometimes confrontational) discussion of contemporary issues in American politics, culture, and current events. The program was on the air in this format and time slot since 1986. Taliaferro also routinely participated in charity and promotional events as a spokesman, moderator and panelist.

Taliaferro had been in broadcasting for over 40 years. He started in talk radio in 1967 at Oakland/San Francisco&#x27;s KNEW (AM) (in 2012, KNEW switched its call letters to KKSF). Shortly thereafter, he also got into television, commuting every day to Burbank (by Los Angeles) to host a show on KHJ-TV (KCAL-TV) before accepting a news anchor position at San Francisco&#x27;s KRON-TV. Taliaferro joined KGO Radio in 1977, when he also co-hosted KGO-TV&#x27;s AM Weekend program.

Taliaferro was claimed to be the first African American talk show host on a major market radio station in the country in 1967. He helped found the National Association of Black Journalists in 1975, and was honored by the San Francisco Black Chamber of Commerce in 1994 with the Black Chamber Life Award, recognizing him as a &quot;forerunner in broadcasting&quot;. Taliaferro was inducted into the National Association of Black Journalists Hall of Fame in 2011, and the association&#x27;s Ray Taliaferro NABJ Entrepreneurial Spirit Award&quot; recognizing &quot;journalistic entrepreneurship&quot; was named in his honor.

Taliaferro aired the last interview (a 58-minute interview) done with Walter Cronkite on his Monday, July 27, 2009 program, following the news of Cronkite&#x27;s death.

===Broadcast persona and format===
Taliaferro&#x27;s nighttime talk show mainly dealt with political issues affecting the United States and the state of California. He can best be described as a progressive Democrat and was one of the most prominent left-wing talk show hosts in the United States. He was known for his consistently strong (and often strident) criticisms of Israel, George W. Bush and other prominent conservative politicians, as well as conservatives who called his show. The Taliaferro show rarely featured guest interviews, but periodically featured special broadcasts related to poetry and music.

Taliaferro discussed &quot;scary&quot; callers in a November 1988 article in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, noting that several women have shown up at the station to meet him and he has had to get security to stop them.

Taliaferro was a lifelong Democrat, and endorsed Barack Obama for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination and election. He was president of the San Francisco chapter of the NAACP from 1968 to 1971.

==Public service==
Although Taliaferro was widely known for his role as an on-air radio personality, he has also been personally acknowledged for his active involvement in the arts and community service. Taliaferro dedicated considerable time and energy to public service to San Francisco, his home town.

Among his many achievements, Taliaferro served as president of the San Francisco chapter of the NAACP, and the Frederick Douglass Symposium. Because of his tremendous efforts to help raise money for leukemia research, he was named board president of the Northern California Chapter of the Leukemia Society of America for 1995 through 2000. He was the Mayor&#x27;s Commissioner of the War Memorial Trustee Board from 1992 through 2000, and he headed up the San Francisco Art Commission for 16 years. He hosted events and served as a member of the Board of Governors of The Commonwealth Club of California.

Ray Taliaferro also performed memorably as music director with his Ray Tal Chorale for Dr. Martin Luther King&#x27;s June 30, 1964 service at the Cow Palace on a stifling hot day to a standing-room-only audience just south of San Francisco. His most thrilling tactic, first observed during the Reagan administration, was to simply challenge callers to &quot;Name one thing (the president) has done.&quot; Ray&#x27;s life&#x27;s work and talent for informing listeners continues to motivate his audience into the 2020s.

==Personal life and death==
Taliaferro was first married to Carolyn Theodosia McAdoo in Los Angeles County. They had three sons. He was remarried to Charlotte Crawford in June 2018.

Taliaferro was reported missing by his wife on November 10, 2018, during a visit to Massac County, Illinois. He was seen later the same day in Paducah, Kentucky, possibly suffering from dementia. He was found dead on December 2, a mile from Paducah. Autopsy results showed Taliaferro died from a combination of hypertensive cardiovascular disease with a likely contribution from hypothermia and environmental exposure. Taliaferro&#x27;s son, Raphael Jr., hired a private investigator to investigate his father&#x27;s death.

The Commonwealth Club hosted a memorial for Mr. Taliaferro in San Francisco on January 14, 2019.

==Trivia==
An aircheck of Taliaferro, from KGO, was sampled by Brian Eno and David Byrne and used on &quot;America Is Waiting&quot;, the first track on My Life in the Bush of Ghosts. The album was recorded at Wally Heider Studios, around the corner from the KGO radio studios, then at 277 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco.

<text>Financial engineering is a multidisciplinary field involving financial theory, methods of engineering, tools of mathematics and the practice of programming. It has also been defined as the application of technical methods, especially from mathematical finance and computational finance, in the practice of finance.

Financial engineering plays a key role in a bank&#x27;s customer-driven derivatives business 
— delivering bespoke OTC-contracts and &quot;exotics&quot;, and implementing various structured products — 
which encompasses quantitative modelling, quantitative programming and risk managing financial products in compliance with the regulations and Basel capital/liquidity requirements.

An older use of the term &quot;financial engineering&quot; that is less common today is aggressive restructuring of corporate balance sheets. 
Mathematical finance is the application of mathematics to finance. Computational finance and mathematical finance are both subfields of financial engineering. Computational finance is a field in computer science and deals with the data and algorithms that arise in financial modeling.

==Discipline==
Financial engineering draws on tools from applied mathematics, computer science, statistics and economic theory.
In the broadest sense, anyone who uses technical tools in finance could be called a financial engineer, for example any computer programmer in a bank or any statistician in a government economic bureau. However, most practitioners restrict the term to someone educated in the full range of tools of modern finance and whose work is informed by financial theory. It is sometimes restricted even further, to cover only those originating new financial products and strategies.

Despite its name, financial engineering does not belong to any of the fields in traditional professional engineering even though many financial engineers have studied engineering beforehand and many universities offering a postgraduate degree in this field require applicants to have a background in engineering as well. In the United States, the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) does not accredit financial engineering degrees. In the United States, financial engineering programs are accredited by the &quot;International Association of Quantitative Finance&quot;.

Quantitative analyst (&quot;Quant&quot;) is a broad term that covers any person who uses math for practical purposes, including financial engineers. Quant is often taken to mean &quot;financial quant&quot;, in which case it is similar to financial engineer. The difference is that it is possible to be a theoretical quant, or a quant in only one specialized niche in finance, while &quot;financial engineer&quot; usually implies a practitioner with broad expertise.

&quot;Rocket scientist&quot; (aerospace engineer) is an older term, first coined in the development of rockets in WWII (Wernher von Braun), and later, the NASA space program; it was adapted by the first generation of financial quants who arrived on Wall Street in the late 1970s and early 1980s. While basically synonymous with financial engineer, it implies adventurousness and fondness for disruptive innovation. Financial &quot;rocket scientists&quot; were usually trained in applied mathematics, statistics or finance and spent their entire careers in risk-taking. They were not hired for their mathematical talents, they either worked for themselves or applied mathematical techniques to traditional financial jobs. The later generation of financial engineers were more likely to have PhDs in mathematics, physics, electrical and computer engineering, and often started their careers in academics or non-financial fields.

==Criticisms==
One of the prominent critics of financial engineering is Nassim Taleb, a professor of financial engineering at Polytechnic Institute of New York University who argues that it replaces common sense and leads to disaster. A series of economic collapses has led many governments to argue a return to &quot;real&quot; engineering from financial engineering.
A gentler criticism came from Emanuel Derman who heads a financial engineering degree program at Columbia University. He blames over-reliance on models for financial problems; see Financial Modelers&#x27; Manifesto.

Many other authors have identified specific problems in financial engineering that caused catastrophes: 
*Aaron Brown named confusion between quants and regulators over the meaning of &quot;capital&quot;
*Felix Salmon gently pointed to the Gaussian copula (see )
*Ian Stewart criticized the Black-Scholes formula
*Pablo Triana (along with others including Taleb and Brown) dislikes value at risk 
*Scott Patterson accused quantitative traders and later high-frequency traders.
*Douglas W. Hubbard notes that the Black–Scholes formula, along with modern portfolio theory, makes no attempt to explain an underlying structure to price changes.
*James Rickards posits that the &quot;key assumptions&quot; underpinning financial risk management are flawed.

The financial innovation often associated with financial engineers was mocked by former chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker in 2009 when he said it was a code word for risky securities, that brought no benefits to society. For most people, he said, the advent of the ATM was more crucial than any asset-backed bond.

==Education==

The first Master of Financial Engineering degree programs were set up in the early 1990s. 
The number and size of programs has grown rapidly, to the extent that some now use the term &quot;financial engineer&quot; to refer to a graduate in the field. 
The financial engineering program at New York University Polytechnic School of Engineering was the first curriculum to be certified by the International Association of Financial Engineers.
The number, and variation, of these programs has grown over the decades subsequent (see ); and lately includes undergraduate study, as well as designations such as the Certificate in Quantitative Finance.

<doc id="324745" wikidata="Q488418" url="?curid=324745" title="Socialist Left Party (Norway)">
<text>The Socialist Left Party (, SV; ) is a democratic socialist political party in Norway. Positioned on the left-wing of the political spectrum, it is opposed to European Union and the European Economic Area membership. SV supports a strong public sector, stronger social welfare programs, environmentalism, and republicanism. As of 2018, the party had 11,385 members; the number has steadily increased since a low point in 2015. The party leader is Kirsti Bergstø, who was elected on 18 March 2023.

The party was founded in 1973 as the Socialist Electoral League, an electoral coalition with the Communist Party of Norway, Socialist People&#x27;s Party, Democratic Socialists – AIK, and independent socialists. In 1975, the coalition was turned into a unified political party. The party was largely founded as a result of the foreign policies prevalent at the time, with the socialists being opposed to Norwegian membership of the European Communities (which later became the European Union) and of NATO. SV calls for a stronger public sector, a mixed economy, and a strengthening of the social welfare net. While advocating democratic socialism, the party also increasingly profiles itself as a supporter of feminism and environmentalism through eco-socialism.

In the 2005 Norwegian parliamentary election, SV became a governing party for the first time, participating in the red–green coalition with the Labour Party and the Centre Party; before that, it was frequently turned down by the Labour Party. SV was reduced to the seventh-largest party following the 2013 Norwegian parliamentary election, in its worst election on record, but bounced back in the 2017 and 2021 parliamentary elections, although it remained both times at the opposition.

== Ideology ==
=== Position ===
Like its predecessors, the Socialist People&#x27;s Party and the Information Committee of the Labour Movement against Norwegian membership in the European Community, the Socialist Left is a left-wing party which favours a welfare state and taxation of the wealthy. Finn Gustavsen, former leader of the Socialist People&#x27;s Party, believed that the Labour Party were not socialists, and the only socialist force in parliament were members from the Socialist Electoral League. He was one of the main opponents of Norwegian membership in the European Community, saying the organisation showed how &quot;evil and stupid&quot; capitalism really was. According to a 2002 poll, one out of four members in the Socialist Left wanted Norway to join the European Union.

The party&#x27;s election program for the 2001 Norwegian parliamentary election stated that the party was a &quot;socialist party&quot; with a vision of a Norway without social injustice. Since its inception, the party has promoted itself as socialist. In later years, the party has been portrayed as social democratic by some in the Norwegian media, and as democratic socialist, and has been categorised as eco-socialist. The incumbent leader Audun Lysbakken has been a self-proclaimed revolutionary, socialist, and Marxist. He believes the party to be a democratic socialist one.

The Socialist Left also advocates the replacement of capitalism with socialism, arguing that

&quot;We shape our own future. It is possible to create a fair and environmentally friendly world, a society where wealth and power are fairly distributed, with freedom and equal rights for all and where we live together within nature&#x27;s tolerance limit.

A lot has to change. Millions live with oppression and war, inequality in power and wealth is growing and the environmental crisis threatens our livelihood.

The capitalist system must be replaced - nationally and globally - by a democratic, sustainable and needs-based economic system. It is socialism.&quot;

==== Education ====

Education has been one of main campaign issues since Kristin Halvorsen became party leader. Øystein Djupedal was elected Minister of Education and Research, and held that position for two years. He was replaced by fellow Socialist Left politician Bård Vegar Solhjell. Halvorsen took over the ministry in late 2009. Djupedal&#x27;s first assignment in office was granting to &quot;even out social differences&quot; between ethnic minorities. The party believes that everyone has the right to free access to kindergarten. Anders Folkestad, leader of the Confederation of Unions for Professionals, was not pleased with Djupedal&#x27;s efforts during his term in office, saying that &quot;Djupedal has created much uncertainty and a mess after he became Minister of Education and Research. Many had great expectations, but he is sure lagging behind from the time when he was a sideliner.&quot; Djupedal was heavily criticised by the Norwegian media for his controversial and bizarre statements. In late 2005, it was estimated that students studying general, business, and administrative studies would save up to under the red–green coalition; school books became free when the coalition took power.

The party wants to reduce the number of private schools, and Djupedal said they are of no use. Bård Vegar Solhjell stated he believed government-funded schools helped &quot;smoothing social inequality&quot;, commenting: &quot;Many of those who remain outside the labor market have received lack of training from school. It prevents them from contributing to the community. Parties on the right often confuse social security and welfare schemes as the problem; however, we tend to look at why they are struggling. There are systematic connections between social background and lack of training - it is a class question where something is needed to be done.&quot; Others believe that the party should nationalise non-public schools. Torbjørn Urfjell, former leader of the Socialist Youth chapter in Vest-Agder, said: &quot;School and adolescence is too important to be left to the market. Therefore, they should be taken back.&quot; During the 2005 Norwegian parliamentary election, the party promised to increase resources to public schools, believing that more money would lead to fewer pupils per teacher, and more individualised and personal instructions.

==== Environment ====

The party has held the office of Minister of the Environment since 2005, first by Helen Bjørnøy, followed by Erik Solheim and since 2012 by Bård Vegar Solhjell. During the 2009 Norwegian parliamentary election, the party promoted itself as the biggest and strongest green party in Norway. The party was highly vocal against oil drilling in Lofoten and Vesterålen during the election campaign. A large minority within the party are opposed to the conservation plan, with the majority of them coming from Nordland, the county where the drilling is taking place. The party struggled, despite the public&#x27;s strong focus on the green movement and global warming. They failed to gather new voters and experienced one of their worst elections in years. By August 2009, various opinion polls gave the party 10% support but lost most of their voters to the Labour Party during the last days of the election.

The party&#x27;s strong emphasis on green politics, and its failure to capture new voters, has led to debate among electoral researchers. Frank Aarebrot commented: &quot;It is interesting that both the Socialist Left and the Liberals has this bad turnout, when the environmental conference is taking place in Copenhagen.&quot; Halvorsen felt the environmental policies of the second Soria Moria declaration showed a clear level of commitment from the party&#x27;s coalition partners.

==== Feminism ====
The party has promoted itself as a feminist party. In one of the Socialist Left&#x27;s brochures published in 2005, it said, &quot;The Socialist Left is a feminist party. We are fighting for a society where women and men have equal opportunities. This means that women should earn as much as men, that there must be more women in the top positions, and that there are welfare schemes that provide equality in the workplace.&quot; During the 2005 parliamentary election, one of the four main issues raised by party&#x27;s youth wing was fighting against sexual harassment. In January 2005, &quot;Klassekampen&quot; asked 150 of the 169 representatives in parliament if they considered themselves feminist. According to the survey, the Socialist Left and the Liberal Party were the two most feminist, while The Progress Party was the least feminist party in parliament.

Audun Lysbakken was Minister of Children and Equality from 2009 to 2012. Arild Stokkan-Grande claimed equality amongst men and women has been a major issue in government mainly because of the activities of the Socialist Left. He claimed that there were more women than men serving in the departments the party controlled.

SV supports the 2008 Sex Purchase Law that criminalises purchasing sex, and the party wants to ban public strip shows.

The party supports the conscription to military services to also include women, which was enacted into legislation in 2015.

==== Immigration and diversity ====
In 1992, Carl I. Hagen of the Progress Party accused the party of supporting free immigration to Norway, after Lisbeth Holand proposed that immigrants from non-European countries should have the same immigration opportunities as immigrants who have their origins from countries who are members of the European Economic Area. While Hagen was highly critical, she felt that the policy would offer housing and jobs for non-Europeans who needed them. An opinion poll showed that 82.9% of the Socialist Left members were open to more immigration, making the party the most immigration-friendly party in parliament, but still less than the non-parliamentary Red Electoral Alliance. In a measurement done in late 2009, the Socialist Left became again the party least hostile to immigrants, this time behind the newly established party Red.

Another poll showed that almost one-third of Socialist Left voters would not want to live in an area with a high number of immigrants. Social geographer Karl Fredrik Tangen responded that it is easy for the typical intellectual Socialist Left voter, living in upper class areas, to agree to what was for them hypothetical question. Recent surveys show that support for the party by immigrants plummeted from 25% in 2005 to 6% in 2009. Norwegian-Somali writer Amal Aden explained that &quot;we do not earn anything from the policies of the Socialist Left. They say that everyone is okay, and that does not work&quot;.

The party is open to more immigration, believing Norway will evolve into a more multicultural society. The party believes the only way to create social equality is to create ethnic equality in Norway. By 2009, Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg said his government would tighten the then prevailing immigration policy, which would make it harder for immigrants to be granted asylum in Norway. The Socialist Left, along with the Liberal Party and the Christian Democrats, felt the new policy was too strict. and the party took a formal dissent in government regarding the asylum policy. The party in particular wants more liberal regulations for asylum cases that involve children.

In 2012, the party leader Audun Lysbakken strongly warned against Islamist extremists like Profetens Ummah, and vowed to fight them. The party is in favour of lifting the ban against religious headwear like hijab and turban for police employees, but has been split over the issue, and a substantial minority, including the youth fraction, voted against allowing religious headwear at the party&#x27;s convention in 2013.

==== International affairs ====
The military action in Kosovo was a controversial issue within the party; the party leadership supported the military intervention, saying the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo had to be stopped. Supporters included Kristin Halvorsen, who favored NATO&#x27;s air strikes, but a large group within the party vehemently opposed such support, arguing that violence would only lead to more violence. The party&#x27;s chapter in Akershus called the attack a &quot;NATO-led terrorist bombing&quot;, and believed the bombing marked the first time that Norway had declared war on another nation. They wanted the United Nations to find a peaceful solution to the conflict. Stein Ørnhøi, leader of the Socialist People&#x27;s Party, said the party&#x27;s representatives in parliament acted preposterously; he felt they made the wrong decision in supporting NATO&#x27;s actions in Kosovo when the majority of the party was against it. During the national convention, Halvorsen threatened to resign as party leader unless the factional fighting within the party stopped. This led to a split within the party, with the first group supporting her resignation and the larger second faction concluding that the NATO bombing was to be immediately terminated if the Serbs stopped the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, if Halvorsen continued as party leader.
In most foreign policy issues, the party has opposed military action. They were against the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan and the Iraq War. After joining the red–green coalition in 2005, the party stopped their strong opposition to the two wars, and in 2008 the party proposed creating a &quot;new strategy&quot; for the Norwegian armed forces located in Afghanistan. In 2007, Erik Solheim from the Ministry of International Development visited Norwegian troops in Afghanistan. The policy regarding Afghanistan has led to much unrest within the party, most notably with the party&#x27;s chapter in Bergen. By early 2008, the party chapters of Hordaland and Rogaland criticised Kristin Halvorsen and the government regarding their Afghanistan policies, and demanded an immediate withdrawal by October 2009. The Oslo chapter asked for drastic changes in the military strategy created by NATO.

Thorbjørn Jagland, then President of the Storting, requested the government should send more soldiers to Afghanistan, if NATO requested it. The Socialist Left supported the war, but was against sending more soldiers to the region, and denied access for the Norwegian Special Forces. Their main reason was that Norway, along with the Netherlands, &quot;clearly had the most soldiers located in Afghanistan&quot;, in relation to population in the respective countries, and Afghanistan was &quot;the largest military commitment Norway currently has abroad&quot;.

== Organisation and structure ==
=== Organs ===
The party is split into five organs: the first national convention, which held every second year, the National Board, the Central Committee, Municipal and Local Chapters, and the Party Representatives. The national convention works as a democratic body for the party, where members representing their county or municipal can elect new national representatives for the party. One example of this is the party leader, who stands for election every second year.

The National Board is the party&#x27;s highest decision-making body between the national conventions. The Board consists of 19 members. Members are elected by each county, plus six members are directly elected during the national convention; some of these are permanent members. In total, there are 36 members. The board meets approximately six times a year to deal with current political and organisational issues. Its task is to adopt the party&#x27;s budget and to select the party&#x27;s permanent political representatives. The Central Committee manages the party in the interim period between National Board meetings. Members of the committee are elected by the national convention. the Committee consists of the party leader, the two deputy leaders, the party secretary, the parliamentary leader, the leader of the Socialist Youth, and five other members. The board holds a meeting almost every Monday. The Municipal and Local Chapters organ works as &quot;communication&quot; body between the chapters and the national party.

The last body, the Party&#x27;s Representative organ, consists of nine national party offices. These offices serves as advisory bodies for the party. The officeholders work alongside the party&#x27;s parliamentary group, the government apparatus, and the rest of the party organisation on their specialised offices. They also have contact with organisations and communities in their local area. The Party&#x27;s Representatives normally meet four to six times a year; the group consists of party members from all over the nation who have any special expertise. Party&#x27;s Representatives are elected by the national convention.

== History ==
=== Formation (1973–1975) ===

After losing all its parliamentary seats in the 1969 parliamentary election, the Socialist People&#x27;s Party sought to create an election coalition between various left-wing parties. While previously being sceptical of working with the Communist Party of Norway, the party eventually became a member of the coalition, along with the Information Committee of the Labour Movement against Norwegian membership in the European Community, Democratic Socialists and various non-party-aligned independent socialists. Reidar T. Larsen, leader of the Communist Party, said the members at the party&#x27;s national convention unanimously agreed to join the coalition, which would later go by the name of the Socialist Electoral League.

It took 16 days to negotiate a settlement between the groups. Members agreed that this coalition would be the only way to get a &quot;socialist government&quot; in Norway. By 1973, the Labour Party had suffered a decrease in popular support, which at that time was estimated to around 100,000 voters. Speculation arose that voters had left the Labour Party for the newly created Socialist Electoral League. Early Labour Party predictions were that the Electoral League would dissolve because of internal strife. Reiulf Steen later stated that he had more &quot;respect&quot; for the Maoist Red Electoral Alliance party than the Electoral League. The coalition gained 11.2% of the popular vote and 16 seats in parliament in the 1973 parliamentary election.

The party now known as the Socialist Left was founded in 1975. The Communist Party did not want to dissolve to become a member of the Socialist Left Party, and voted against membership. This led to an internal struggle within the party, with the party&#x27;s official newspaper, &quot;Friheten&quot;, strongly suggesting the party could not dissolve, because that would mean the death of the revolutionary movement. The official newspaper of the Socialist People&#x27;s Party, &quot;Orientering&quot;, attacked what they called the &quot;hard-core&quot; leaders of the Communist Party. Without the Communist Party, the other parties voted to dissolve the coalition and to replace it with a political party.

=== Early years (1976–1997) ===

The first years were not successful, as the party lost many of its seats in Parliament, but under Berge Furre&#x27;s leadership during the 1980s, the party&#x27;s popularity rose again. Internal conflicts within the party escalated; there were rumours that then–deputy leader Steinar Stjernø was trying to throw out the social democratic wing of the party. A more serious problem for the party was that two of the party&#x27;s MPs had been convicted of betrayal of the country in the aftermath of World War II, the most notable being Hanna Kvanmo. Later, Kvanmo became one of the leading and best-liked politicians in Norway. Under the leadership of Theo Koritzinsky later in the 1980s, the party became prominent for its efforts for peace, disarmament, employment, green politics, and economic equality.

At the beginning of the 1990s under Erik Solheim, party popularity again declined. SV lost most of its &quot;no to EU&quot; voters to the Centre Party, when the party fought actively against Norwegian membership in the European Union, and when Norwegians again voted against membership in a referendum. Solheim&#x27;s tenure as leader – while praised by some – was seen as very controversial. The socialist wing of the party, the &quot;Museum Guardians&quot;, as they were called, were worried that Solheim was moving the party too much to the center. Outside critics of Solheim said his policies had led to a &quot;grey-blue social democratic&quot; party, with little or no differences from the Labour Party. Solheim tried to get the party to change direction and form a coalition government with the Labour and the Centre Party. Solheim was forced to resign in 1997, with the party seeing him as the main reason for the new power struggle between the left- and right-wing factions of the party.

=== Early leadership of Halvorsen (1997–2005) ===
With the election of Kristin Halvorsen as new party leader in 1997, the party&#x27;s popularity rose again. Under her leadership, the main focus became education, and the slogan &quot;children and youth first&quot; was coined. The party steadily built up its voter base during the Labour Stoltenberg&#x27;s First Cabinet, which moved the Labour Party more to center, while privatising government-held assets. This led to a historic high voter turnout for the Socialist Left; they earned 12.5% of the national vote in the 2001 Norwegian parliamentary election. The Labour Party earned a record-low turnout, with only 24.3% of the vote. The turnout only worsened the inner struggle within the party, with party leader Thorbjørn Jagland and Jens Stoltenberg accusing each other. The right-wing faction of the party wanted to continue to move the party further to the center, while the left-wing faction wanted to move the party closer to the Socialist Left. By early 2005, polls showed that over 20% of Norwegian voters would vote for the Socialist Left.
Prime minister Kjell Magne Bondevik from the Christian Democratic Party believed the three parties were &quot;unclear&quot; and &quot;vague&quot; when talking about the red–green coalition ideological and political position. After discussing the state budget of Norway with the Socialist Left and the Centre Party, Jens Stoltenberg agreed with Halvorsen that they needed to create a universal free day care service. By February 2005, an opinion poll gave the coalition 96 of 169 seats in parliament, with the Socialist Left increasing with 3.9%. Later in February, a small faction within the party called the future coalition the Red-Grey Coalition, believing the environmental policies of the Labour and the Centre Party were not &quot;radical enough&quot;.

Before the 2005 Norwegian parliamentary election, Deputy Leader Øystein Djupedal said that the Socialist Left would not contribute to any radical changes if they earned a position within the government. Erna Solberg, leader of the Conservative Party, accused the party of being &quot;communist&quot;, because some of its present and earlier connections to communist organisations around Europe. By early August, the Socialist Left was the party having the most progress in the opinion polls, but 17% of the people who voted for the Socialist Left previously were unsure what party they would vote for in the 2005 election. By late August, the party was labelled one of the &quot;big losers&quot; in the election, along with the Conservative Party. Many election researchers believed that the Socialist Left had lost voter&#x27;s interest when they entered the coalition and worked alongside the Labour Party. The bad election results led to internal struggles within the party, with Djupedal claiming it to be the hardest election in the party history. The party had 5 of 19 ministers in the government, one more than the Centre Party.

=== Red–green coalition (2005–2013) ===

In the 2009 Norwegian parliamentary election, the party lost four seats and was left with 11, but a three-seat gain by the Labour Party secured the red–green coalition an 86–83 majority. The shift of power within the coalition resulted in the loss of one Socialist Left cabinet minister, leaving them with four, the same as the Centre Party. The Socialist Left and Halvorsen conceded the influential Ministry of Finance to the Labour Party in order to keep control of the Ministry of Education and Research.

Halvorsen announced her resignation following the 2011 Norwegian local elections. The new leader was to be chosen on an extraordinary party congress in 2012. Audun Lysbakken, Heikki Holmås, and Bård Vegar Solhjell have announced their candidature for the leader position. Lysbakken was elected the party&#x27;s leader on 11 March 2012. The Red Party has criticised the SV for forming a government with the Labour Party, which is regarded by many on the Norwegian Left to be neoliberal, and opening the Barents Sea to oil drilling as well as supporting the NATO-led 2011 military intervention in Libya.

=== Return to opposition (2013–present) ===
Under the leadership of Audun Lysbakken, the party had strong gains in its vote share in elections and membership. In the 2017 Norwegian parliamentary election, the party gained four seats but the incumbent right-wing government led by Erna Solberg was renowned. The 2021 Norwegian parliamentary election was a big win for the left-wing opposition in an election fought on climate change, inequality, and oil. Jonas Gahr Støre&#x27;s Labour Party was aiming to form a majority government with the Centre Party and the Socialist Left Party, but the latter stated that it would remain in opposition, citing disagreements over climate and welfare policies, while remaining open for future negotiations and to support the government on common grounds. To the press, Lysbakken said the party was open for future negotiations, commenting that it was a good and friendly negotiation, and would be going into opposition for the time being. Centre Party leader Trygve Slagsvold Vedum said: &quot;I think it is the responsibility of the Labour Party and the Socialist Left Party to keep a good tone and see if we can lay the groundwork for a new government.&quot; While disappointed for not forming his favoured government, Støre described the talks as friendly and respectful.

On 9 November 2022, Lysbakken, citing family reasons, announced that he would not seek re-election as party leader and would step down at the next party convention in March 2023. Lysbakken was succeeded by his deputy leader, Kirsti Bergstø, at the party convention in March.

== Election history ==

=== Parliamentary elections ===
In the parliamentary elections in Norway, the Socialist Left Party is the seventh-largest party in Norway, behind the Labour Party, the Conservative Party, the Progress Party, the Christian Democratic Party, the Centre Party, and the Liberal Party. Its popularity initially declined from levels achieved by the Socialist Electoral League. Its seat count rose to its peak after the 2001 Norwegian parliamentary election; this election also marked the Socialist Left&#x27;s largest voter count, with 12.5% of the national vote.

When the Socialist Electoral League was founded in the early 1970s, the party won voters from the Labour Party, which ruled as a majority government. Early speculation said that the Labour Party had lost 100,000 votes to the Socialist Electoral League. In the 1973 Norwegian parliamentary election, the party gained 16 seats in Storting. After the unification process was finished, the party&#x27;s voter base collapsed, falling to 4.2% of the national vote in the 1977 Norwegian parliamentary election, and earned only two seats in parliament. In the 1989 Norwegian parliamentary election, the Socialist Left gathered 10.1% of the national vote, falling back again after the 1997 Norwegian parliamentary election.

After having what many described as a bad election, the Labour Party lost many of its voters to the Socialist Left in 2001, with the Socialist Left increasing from 6% to 12.5% of the national vote, again becoming the fourth largest party in the country. In the 2005 Norwegian parliamentary election, the party gathered 8.8% of the vote; this further decreased in the 2009 Norwegian parliamentary election, when the Socialist Left gathered 6.2% of the vote; and again in the 2013 Norwegian parliamentary election, when it gathered 4.1%, 1,600 votes away from falling under the election threshold. The Socialist Left Party bounced back in the mid-2010s, making gains in the 2017 Norwegian parliamentary election, and contributing to the big left-wing opposition win in the 2021 Norwegian parliamentary election.

=== Local elections ===
The 1975 Norwegian local elections were met with a sharp decrease in voters, with the party earning a disappointing voter turnout of 5.5% in the municipal election and 5.7% in the county election. In an opinion poll done before election day in 1975, it was estimated that half of the voters who voted for the Socialist Electoral League would not vote for the party again. The decrease in voters was due to the Labour Party&#x27;s election surge during the 1973 Norwegian parliamentary election. The party further decreased in popular support by the 1979 Norwegian local elections, earning 4.1% in the municipal and 4.4% in the county respectively.

By the 1983 Norwegian local elections, the party increased by 1% in the municipal and 0.9% in the county election. According to an opinion poll done in early September, the Labour Party would lose four of its Oslo representatives in parliament to the Progress Party, the Conservative Party, and the Socialist Left. If the 1983 local election had been a parliamentary election, the Socialist Left would have received 8 seats in parliament. The party earned 5.5% and 5.7% in the 1987 Norwegian local elections, respectively at the municipal and county level. The party&#x27;s strongest county was Nordland, where the party gained 21.9% of the popular vote.

The 1991 Norwegian local elections marked a large increase in voters for the party, earning 11.6 in the municipalities and 12.2% in the counties, making the party the third-largest party in Norway. The Socialist Left, along with the Centre Party, was named the election&#x27;s &quot;big winners&quot; by the Norwegian press. In the 1995 Norwegian local elections, the party gathered 5.9% in the municipalities and 6.1% in counties. Before the 1999 Norwegian local elections, polls showed an increase in popular support for the Socialist Left in Oslo. The reason for the increase was that the party was again able to win votes from the Labour Party. The party gained 7.8% of the votes in the municipalities and 8.5% in the counties.

By 2003, the party&#x27;s voter based had increased dramatically over the 1999 local elections. The party had what many described as a &quot;record election&quot;, winning most of its voters from the Labour Party. The 2007 Norwegian local elections resulted in their voter base to reduced by half. In the 2011 Norwegian local elections, the party got just slightly above 4% of all votes on a nationwide basis. After this, party leader Kristin Halvorsen announced her resignation on the election night. A similar result occurred in the 2015 Norwegian local elections, despite gains for left-leaning parties, but the Socialist Left was able to form a majority coalition with the Labour Party and Red Party in Tromsø. In the 2019 Norwegian local elections, the Socialist Left Party returned to its 2007 levels and made further gains, alongside the Green and Red parties.

<doc id="324749" wikidata="Q207527" url="?curid=324749" title="Sine wave">
<text>A sine wave, sinusoidal wave, or sinusoid (symbol: ∿) is a periodic wave whose waveform (shape) is the trigonometric sine function. In mechanics, as a linear motion over time, this is &quot;simple harmonic motion&quot;; as rotation, it corresponds to &quot;uniform circular motion&quot;. Sine waves occur often in physics, including wind waves, sound waves, and light waves, such as monochromatic radiation. In engineering, signal processing, and mathematics, Fourier analysis decomposes general functions into a sum of sine waves of various frequencies, relative phases, and magnitudes.

When any two sine waves of the same frequency (but arbitrary phase) are linearly combined, the result is another sine wave of the same frequency; this property is unique among periodic waves. Conversely, if some phase is chosen as a zero reference, a sine wave of arbitrary phase can be written as the linear combination of two sine waves with phases of zero and a quarter cycle, the &quot;sine&quot; and &quot;cosine&quot; components, respectively.

== Audio example ==
A sine wave represents a single frequency with no harmonics and is considered an acoustically pure tone. Adding sine waves of different frequencies results in a different waveform. Presence of higher harmonics in addition to the fundamental causes variation in the timbre, which is the reason why the same musical pitch played on different instruments sounds different.

==Sinusoid form==
Sine waves of arbitrary phase and amplitude are called &quot;sinusoids&quot; and have the general form:
formula_1
where:
* &quot;formula_2&quot;, &quot;amplitude&quot;, the peak deviation of the function from zero.
* formula_3, the real independent variable, usually representing time in seconds.
* formula_4, &quot;angular frequency&quot;, the rate of change of the function argument in units of radians per second.
* &quot;formula_5&quot;, &quot;ordinary frequency&quot;, the &quot;number&quot; of oscillations (cycles) that occur each second of time.
* formula_6, &quot;phase&quot;, specifies (in radians) where in its cycle the oscillation is at &quot;t&quot; = 0.
** When formula_6 is non-zero, the entire waveform appears to be shifted backwards in time by the amount formula_8 seconds. A negative value represents a delay, and a positive value represents an advance.
** Adding or subtracting formula_9 (one cycle) to the phase results in an equivalent wave.

== As a function of both position and time ==

Sinusoids that exist in both position and time also have:

* a spatial variable formula_10 that represents the &quot;position&quot; on the dimension on which the wave propagates. 
* a wave number (or angular wave number) formula_11, which represents the proportionality between the angular frequency formula_4 and the linear speed (speed of propagation) formula_13:
** wavenumber is related to the angular frequency by formula_14 where formula_15 (lambda) is the wavelength. 

Depending on their direction of travel, they can take the form:

*formula_16, if the wave is moving to the right, or
*formula_17, if the wave is moving to the left.
Since sine waves propagate without changing form in &quot;distributed linear systems&quot;, they are often used to analyze wave propagation.

=== Standing waves ===

When two waves with the same amplitude and frequency traveling in opposite directions superpose each other, then a standing wave pattern is created.

On a plucked string, the superimposing waves are the waves reflected from the fixed endpoints of the string. The string&#x27;s resonant frequencies are the string&#x27;s only possible standing waves, which only occur for wavelengths that are twice the string&#x27;s length (corresponding to the fundamental frequency) and integer divisions of that (corresponding to higher harmonics).

=== Multiple spatial dimensions ===
The earlier equation gives the displacement formula_18 of the wave at a position formula_10 at time formula_3 along a single line. This could, for example, be considered the value of a wave along a wire.

In two or three spatial dimensions, the same equation describes a travelling plane wave if position formula_10 and wavenumber formula_11 are interpreted as vectors, and their product as a dot product. For more complex waves such as the height of a water wave in a pond after a stone has been dropped in, more complex equations are needed.

==== Sinusoidal plane wave ====
== Fourier analysis ==
French mathematician Joseph Fourier discovered that sinusoidal waves can be summed as simple building blocks to approximate any periodic waveform, including square waves. These Fourier series are frequently used in signal processing and the statistical analysis of time series. The Fourier transform then extended Fourier series to handle general functions, and birthed the field of Fourier analysis.

== Differentiation and integration ==
=== Differentiation ===
Differentiating any sinusoid with respect to time can be viewed as multiplying its amplitude by its angular frequency and advancing it by a quarter cycle:

formula_23

A differentiator has a zero at the origin of the complex frequency plane. The gain of its frequency response increases at a rate of +20 dB per decade of frequency (for root-power quantities), the same positive slope as a 1 order high-pass filter&#x27;s stopband, although a differentiator doesn&#x27;t have a cutoff frequency or a flat passband. A n-order high-pass filter approximately applies the n time derivative of signals whose frequency band is significantly lower than the filter&#x27;s cutoff frequency.

=== Integration ===
Integrating any sinusoid with respect to time can be viewed as dividing its amplitude by its angular frequency and delaying it a quarter cycle:

formula_24

The constant of integration formula_25 will be zero if the bounds of integration is an integer multiple of the sinusoid&#x27;s period.

An integrator has a pole at the origin of the complex frequency plane. The gain of its frequency response falls off at a rate of -20 dB per decade of frequency (for root-power quantities), the same negative slope as a 1 order low-pass filter&#x27;s stopband, although an integrator doesn&#x27;t have a cutoff frequency or a flat passband. A n-order low-pass filter approximately performs the n time integral of signals whose frequency band is significantly higher than the filter&#x27;s cutoff frequency.

<text>Colonel William Hayward Wakefield (1801 – 19 September 1848) was an English officer of the British Auxiliary Legion, and the leader of the second New Zealand Company&#x27;s first colonising expedition to New Zealand; one of the founders of Wellington city. As a leader, he attracted much controversy.

==Early life==
William Wakefield was born just outside London in 1801, the son of Edward Wakefield (1774–1854), a distinguished surveyor and land agent, and Susanna Crush (1767–1816). His grandmother, Priscilla Wakefield (1751–1832), was a popular children&#x27;s author and helped to establish savings banks.

Wakefield&#x27;s siblings were Catherine Gurney Wakefield (1793–1873), the mother of Charles Torlesse (1825–1866); Edward Gibbon Wakefield (1796–1862); Daniel Wakefield (1798–1858); Arthur Wakefield (1799–1843); John Howard Wakefield (1803–1862); Felix Wakefield (1807–1875); Priscilla Susannah Wakefield (1809–1887); Percy Wakefield (1810–1832); and an unnamed child born in 1813.

Wakefield was largely raised by his elder sister, Catherine, who found him a difficult child. As he grew older he came under the influence of his elder brother, Edward Gibbon Wakefield, who was later to establish the New Zealand Company.

== Imprisonment ==
In 1825, Wakefield became formally betrothed to Emily Sidney, but before they could be married he became involved with his elder brother Edward in the abduction of a wealthy heiress and both brothers were arrested. While out on bail, Wakefield absconded to Paris, apparently to meet with Emily who was three months pregnant. He returned to England when the baby was born and was promptly arrested and held in Lancaster Castle until his trial, and subsequently sentenced to three years in jail. During this time, Emily Sidney died, leaving him with a daughter also named Emily.

== Military service ==
Upon his release from jail, Wakefield spent some time with his daughter and his sister Catherine. In 1832 he travelled to Portugal and enlisted as a mercenary soldier in the service of Dom Pedro, the Emperor of Brazil. Although he had no military experience, Wakefield was apparently able to enlist as a Captain. He survived the Siege of Porto and the subsequent campaigning, and earned several medals.

After his time in Portugal, Wakefield returned briefly to England and enlisted in the British Auxiliary Legion (BAL) fighting for the infant Queen Isabella II of Spain in the First Carlist War. He emerged from the campaign with the rank of major, re-enlisted, and was promoted to lieutenant colonel. Among his junior officers was Henry Inman (police commander). Wakefield was one of the few officers to survive the campaign; he stayed until the Legion was disbanded in 1837 and returned to England the following year. Regarding the 1st Reina Isabel Lancers, BAL, Alexander Somerville noted:
They were commanded by Colonel Wakefield, an officer who was strict in discipline, though not so tyrannical as Colonel Kinloch, their former commanding officer, but every whit as brave and efficient before the enemy. Kinloch was a tyrant, but at the same time a clever officer, and hero in courage. He was the son of the late M. P. for Dundee. Wakefield, on the other hand, was as clever, less tyrannical, and distinguished, nay, almost reckless in courage.&quot;
==The &quot;Tory&quot; expedition==
In early 1839, the New Zealand Company in London was hurriedly organising its first expedition, eager to take advantage of the still uncertain governance situation in New Zealand. The Company&#x27;s aim was to establish a model of English society in New Zealand by selling land to settlers at a profit and using the funds to pay for settlers&#x27; travel to New Zealand, encouraging immigration. In reality, the Company was more like a real estate agency, promising generous returns to its investors.

At the suggestion of his brother, Edward Gibbon, the New Zealand Company appointed Wakefield as commander of this first expedition. The &quot;Tory&quot; sailed from Plymouth on 12 May 1839, with Wakefield as sole and unqualified leader of the expedition. He was given set of instructions for the expedition&#x27;s activities: to purchase land for the New Zealand Company, to gather knowledge about New Zealand, and to prepare for building settlements. Wakefield was expected to treat the Māori with the utmost fairness.

Wakefield&#x27;s first sight of New Zealand&#x27;s formidable mountain ranges was not encouraging. The expedition took on supplies of wood and water at Ship Cove in Queen Charlotte Sound and met their first Māori, who were interested in trading.

After five weeks in the Marlborough Sounds in the South Island, the &quot;Tory&quot; sailed across Cook Strait to Te Whanganui-a-Tara (&quot;The Big Harbour of Tara&quot;) and Port Nicholson. Here he began serious negotiations for purchasing land. The negotiations involved two iwi (tribes), Ngāti Toa and Te Atiawa, and sixteen chiefs. After five days a deal was made that was subsequently endorsed by the paramount chief of the area, Te Rauparaha. Strong objections were raised by Te Rauparaha&#x27;s nephew, Te Rangihaeata.

The purchase completed, Wakefield and the &quot;Tory&quot; set out to explore a more of New Zealand, sailing up the west coast. The expedition were impressed with the potential of the Taranaki area for further settlement. They then sailed up to the Hokianga, made contact with traders, and looked at buying land in that district. However, the expedition was cut short when the &quot;Tory&quot; ran aground in Hokianga Harbour. The ship was saved but it needed extensive repairs.

== Wellington settlement ==
Wakefield returned to Te Whanganui-a-Tara in early January 1840. The first British settlers’ ships arrived in Port Nicholson in January, encouraged by the New Zealand Company&#x27;s advertisements promoting immigration. However, it became clear that the land around Petone was not suitable for settlement, being too swampy. A new site had to be selected and Lambton Harbour was chosen, a few kilometres further west. 

This site was already occupied by Māori, being one of their residential areas. Wakefield had bought and paid for the land on behalf of the New Zealand Company, but soon realised that Māori had had a different understanding of the deal; they had expected to share the land with Pākeha (non-Māori), and were unwilling to move. 

When the missionary Henry Williams appeared in the district with copies of the Treaty of Waitangi for Māori to sign, he also claimed some of the land the New Zealand Company had purchased. Wakefield granted him one acre (4,000 m²) of town land, but Williams was later to lose his role as a missionary for defrauding Māori. 

Wakefield believed that Port Nicholson&#x27;s central position made it the obvious choice to be New Zealand&#x27;s capital and seat of government. However, Governor William Hobson chose Auckland, possibly feeling that Port Nicholson was dominated by the New Zealand Company. When the General Legislative Council was formed in May 1841, Hobson appointed Wakefield as one of its members. Wakefield&#x27;s membership terminated only a few months later. 

In 1842, Wakefield was joined in New Zealand by his daughter Emily, then sixteen years old. Shortly afterwards she became engaged to Francis Molesworth, but the engagement was broken off when an injury forced Molesworth to return to England. In late 1845, Emily met Edward Stafford of Nelson and they were married the following year. 

=== Criticism of land deals ===
The secretive and rushed way that the New Zealand Company had begun settlement ahead of the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi created problems for Wakefield. Governor William Hobson resented the New Zealand Company, seeing the Settlers&#x27; Council as an attempt to establish an illegal republic. The Acting Colonial Secretary Willoughby Shortland was dispatched with soldiers and mounted police to disband the council.

Several land deals were renegotiated, as many settlers were either not happy with the land they had been allocated or hadn&#x27;t received what they had paid for. To satisfy its commitments, the New Zealand Company needed about 500 square kilometres of land, which was difficult considering the terrain in the Wellington area and the fact that the Company had limited resources.

Over the next few years, Wakefield was involved in disputes with the Crown, with Māori, and with his own surveyors, meaning that land deals were delayed by months or years. The New Zealand Company had guaranteed work for labourers that emigrated to New Zealand, but delays over land deals led to a lack of work, causing further anger. At one stage, the town of Nelson was almost in a state of armed rebellion against the Company’s agents.

In 2003, the Waitangi Tribunal investigated the New Zealand Company&#x27;s 1839 Port Nicholson deed of purchase and declared it invalid. The tribunal found that Māori were never paid for some , the boundaries weren&#x27;t clear, not all those with customary rights signed the deed, and those who did sign didn&#x27;t understand it, as it was in English and Richard Barrett&#x27;s translation missed or confused several important facts. 

== Personal troubles ==
The unruly behaviour of Wakefield&#x27;s nephew, Jerningham, caused concern for Wakefield. Wakefield was also affected by the death of his brother Arthur in the Wairau Affray, and felt partly responsible. This led Wakefield to clash with Governor Robert FitzRoy when FitzRoy declined to take action against Arthur&#x27;s killers.The New Zealand Company&#x27;s issues were made worse by Wakefield&#x27;s personality; he demonstrated no leadership qualities and was unwilling to take initiative in dealing with problems, alienating many settlers. One settler wrote that &quot;the baneful influence of Colonel Wakefield has ruined every settler and the colony of Port Nicholson.&quot; Another described Wakefield as &quot;the coldest mannered man they have met&quot;. 

In March 1847, Wakefield fought a duel with his doctor, Isaac Featherston, over an editorial in the Wellington Independent newspaper that questioned his honesty. Featherstone fired first and missed, then Wakefield fired into the air, stating &quot;I would not shoot a man who has seven daughters&quot;.

== Death ==
On 15 September 1848, Wakefield collapsed at a bath house following two strokes earlier that year, and he died four days later in a room at the Wellington Hotel. He was given what amounted to a state funeral. Governor George Grey attended as did nearly half of Wellington, both Māori and Pākeha. Māori chief Hōniana Te Puni-kōkopu was one of the pallbearers.

Soon after his death, Wakefield&#x27;s friends began to fundraise for a memorial, but it was not until 1882 that the William Wakefield Memorial was unveiled at Wellington&#x27;s Basin Reserve. The memorial is registered as a Category I heritage structure by the Heritage New Zealand.

<text>In differential geometry, the Atiyah–Singer index theorem, proved by Michael Atiyah and Isadore Singer (1963), states that for an elliptic differential operator on a compact manifold, the analytical index (related to the dimension of the space of solutions) is equal to the topological index (defined in terms of some topological data). It includes many other theorems, such as the Chern–Gauss–Bonnet theorem and Riemann–Roch theorem, as special cases, and has applications to theoretical physics.

== History ==
The index problem for elliptic differential operators was posed by Israel Gel&#x27;fand. He noticed the homotopy invariance of the index, and asked for a formula for it by means of topological invariants. Some of the motivating examples included the Riemann–Roch theorem and its generalization the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem, and the Hirzebruch signature theorem. Friedrich Hirzebruch and Armand Borel had proved the integrality of the Â genus of a spin manifold, and Atiyah suggested that this integrality could be explained if it were the index of the Dirac operator (which was rediscovered by Atiyah and Singer in 1961).

The Atiyah–Singer theorem was announced in 1963. The proof sketched in this announcement was never published by them, though it appears in Palais&#x27;s book. It appears also in the &quot;Séminaire Cartan-Schwartz 1963/64&quot; that was held in Paris simultaneously with the seminar led by Richard Palais at Princeton University. The last talk in Paris was by Atiyah on manifolds with boundary. Their first published proof replaced the cobordism theory of the first proof with K-theory, and they used this to give proofs of various generalizations in another sequence of papers.

*1965: Sergey P. Novikov published his results on the topological invariance of the rational Pontryagin classes on smooth manifolds.
* Robion Kirby and Laurent C. Siebenmann&#x27;s results, combined with René Thom&#x27;s paper proved the existence of rational Pontryagin classes on topological manifolds. The rational Pontryagin classes are essential ingredients of the index theorem on smooth and topological manifolds.
*1969: Michael Atiyah defines abstract elliptic operators on arbitrary metric spaces. Abstract elliptic operators became protagonists in Kasparov&#x27;s theory and Connes&#x27;s noncommutative differential geometry.
*1971: Isadore Singer proposes a comprehensive program for future extensions of index theory.
*1972: Gennadi G. Kasparov publishes his work on the realization of K-homology by abstract elliptic operators.
*1973: Atiyah, Raoul Bott, and Vijay Patodi gave a new proof of the index theorem using the heat equation, described in a paper by Melrose.
*1977: Dennis Sullivan establishes his theorem on the existence and uniqueness of Lipschitz and quasiconformal structures on topological manifolds of dimension different from 4.
*1983: Ezra Getzler motivated by ideas of Edward Witten and Luis Alvarez-Gaume, gave a short proof of the local index theorem for operators that are locally Dirac operators; this covers many of the useful cases.
*1983: Nicolae Teleman proves that the analytical indices of signature operators with values in vector bundles are topological invariants.
*1984: Teleman establishes the index theorem on topological manifolds.
*1986: Alain Connes publishes his fundamental paper on noncommutative geometry.
*1989: Simon K. Donaldson and Sullivan study Yang–Mills theory on quasiconformal manifolds of dimension 4. They introduce the signature operator &quot;S&quot; defined on differential forms of degree two.
*1990: Connes and Henri Moscovici prove the local index formula in the context of non-commutative geometry.
*1994: Connes, Sullivan, and Teleman prove the index theorem for signature operators on quasiconformal manifolds.

== Notation ==
*&quot;X&quot; is a compact smooth manifold (without boundary).
*&quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot; are smooth vector bundles over &quot;X&quot;.
*&quot;D&quot; is an elliptic differential operator from &quot;E&quot; to &quot;F&quot;. So in local coordinates it acts as a differential operator, taking smooth sections of &quot;E&quot; to smooth sections of &quot;F&quot;.

==Symbol of a differential operator==
If &quot;D&quot; is a differential operator on a Euclidean space of order &quot;n&quot; in &quot;k&quot; variables formula_1, then its symbol is the function of 2&quot;k&quot; variables
formula_2, given by dropping all terms of order less than &quot;n&quot; and replacing formula_3 by formula_4. So the symbol is homogeneous in the variables &quot;y&quot;, of degree &quot;n&quot;. The symbol is well defined even though formula_3 does not commute with formula_6 because we keep only the highest order terms and differential operators commute &quot;up to lower-order terms&quot;. The operator is called elliptic if the symbol is nonzero whenever at least one &quot;y&quot; is nonzero.

Example: The Laplace operator in &quot;k&quot; variables has symbol formula_7, and so is elliptic as this is nonzero whenever any of the formula_4&#x27;s are nonzero. The wave operator has symbol formula_9, which is not elliptic if formula_10, as the symbol vanishes for some non-zero values of the &quot;y&quot;s.

The symbol of a differential operator of order &quot;n&quot; on a smooth manifold &quot;X&quot; is defined in much the same way using local coordinate charts, and is a function on the cotangent bundle of &quot;X&quot;, homogeneous of degree &quot;n&quot; on each cotangent space. (In general, differential operators transform in a rather complicated way under coordinate transforms (see jet bundle); however, the highest order terms transform like tensors so we get well defined homogeneous functions on the cotangent spaces that are independent of the choice of local charts.) More generally, the symbol of a differential operator between two vector bundles &quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot; is a section of the pullback of the bundle Hom(&quot;E&quot;, &quot;F&quot;) to the cotangent space of &quot;X&quot;. The differential operator is called &quot;elliptic&quot; if the element of Hom(&quot;Ex&quot;, &quot;Fx&quot;) is invertible for all non-zero cotangent vectors at any point &quot;x&quot; of &quot;X&quot;.

A key property of elliptic operators is that they are almost invertible; this is closely related to the fact that their symbols are almost invertible. More precisely, an elliptic operator &quot;D&quot; on a compact manifold has a (non-unique) parametrix (or pseudoinverse) &quot;D&quot;′ such that &quot;DD′ -1 &quot;and &quot;D′D -1&quot; are both compact operators. An important consequence is that the kernel of &quot;D&quot; is finite-dimensional, because all eigenspaces of compact operators, other than the kernel, are finite-dimensional. (The pseudoinverse of an elliptic differential operator is almost never a differential operator. However, it is an elliptic pseudodifferential operator.)

==Analytical index==
As the elliptic differential operator &quot;D&quot; has a pseudoinverse, it is a Fredholm operator. Any Fredholm operator has an &quot;index&quot;, defined as the difference between the (finite) dimension of the kernel of &quot;D&quot; (solutions of &quot;Df&quot; = 0), and the (finite) dimension of the cokernel of &quot;D&quot; (the constraints on the right-hand-side of an inhomogeneous equation like &quot;Df&quot; = &quot;g&quot;, or equivalently the kernel of the adjoint operator). In other words,
:Index(&quot;D&quot;) = dim Ker(D) − dim Coker(&quot;D&quot;) = dim Ker(D) − dim Ker(&quot;D*&quot;).
This is sometimes called the analytical index of &quot;D&quot;.

Example: Suppose that the manifold is the circle (thought of as R/Z), and &quot;D&quot; is the operator d/dx − λ for some complex constant λ. (This is the simplest example of an elliptic operator.) Then the kernel is the space of multiples of exp(λ&quot;x&quot;) if λ is an integral multiple of 2π&quot;i&quot; and is 0 otherwise, and the kernel of the adjoint is a similar space with λ replaced by its complex conjugate. So &quot;D&quot; has index 0. This example shows that the kernel and cokernel of elliptic operators can jump discontinuously as the elliptic operator varies, so there is no nice formula for their dimensions in terms of continuous topological data. However the jumps in the dimensions of the kernel and cokernel are the same, so the index, given by the difference of their dimensions, does indeed vary continuously, and can be given in terms of topological data by the index theorem.

==Topological index==
The topological index of an elliptic differential operator formula_11 between smooth vector bundles formula_12 and formula_13 on an formula_14-dimensional compact manifold formula_15 is given by

:formula_16

in other words the value of the top dimensional component of the mixed cohomology class formula_17 on the fundamental homology class of the manifold formula_15 up to a difference of sign.
Here,

*formula_19 is the Todd class of the complexified tangent bundle of formula_15.
*formula_21 is equal to formula_22, where
**formula_23 is the Thom isomorphism for the sphere bundle formula_24
**formula_25 is the Chern character
**formula_26 is the &quot;difference element&quot; in formula_27 associated to two vector bundles formula_28 and formula_29 on formula_30 and an isomorphism formula_31 between them on the subspace formula_32.
**formula_31 is the symbol of formula_11

In some situations, it is possible to simplify the above formula for computational purposes. In particular, if formula_15 is a formula_36-dimensional orientable (compact) manifold with non-zero Euler class formula_37, then applying the Thom isomorphism and dividing by the Euler class, the topological index may be expressed as 
:formula_38
where division makes sense by pulling formula_39 back from the cohomology ring of the classifying space formula_40.

One can also define the topological index using only K-theory (and this alternative definition is compatible in a certain sense with the Chern-character construction above). If &quot;X&quot; is a compact submanifold of a manifold &quot;Y&quot; then there is a pushforward (or &quot;shriek&quot;) map from K(&quot;TX&quot;) to K(&quot;TY&quot;). The topological index of an element of 
K(&quot;TX&quot;) is defined to be the image of this operation with &quot;Y&quot; some Euclidean space, for which K(&quot;TY&quot;) can be naturally identified with the integers Z (as a consequence of Bott-periodicity). This map is independent of the embedding of &quot;X&quot; in Euclidean space. Now a differential operator as above naturally defines an element of K(&quot;TX&quot;), and the image in Z under this map &quot;is&quot; the topological index.

As usual, &quot;D&quot; is an elliptic differential operator between vector bundles &quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot; over a compact manifold &quot;X&quot;.

The &quot;index problem&quot; is the following: compute the (analytical) index of &quot;D&quot; using only the symbol &quot;s&quot; and &quot;topological&quot; data derived from the manifold and the vector bundle. The Atiyah–Singer index theorem solves this problem, and states:

:The analytical index of &quot;D&quot; is equal to its topological index.

In spite of its formidable definition, the topological index is usually straightforward to evaluate explicitly. So this makes it possible to evaluate the analytical index. (The cokernel and kernel of an elliptic operator are in general extremely hard to evaluate individually; the index theorem shows that we can usually at least evaluate their difference.) Many important invariants of a manifold (such as the signature) can be given as the index of suitable differential operators, so the index theorem allows us to evaluate these invariants in terms of topological data.

Although the analytical index is usually hard to evaluate directly, it is at least obviously an integer. The topological index is by definition a rational number, but it is usually not at all obvious from the definition that it is also integral. So the Atiyah–Singer index theorem implies some deep integrality properties, as it implies that the topological index is integral.

The index of an elliptic differential operator obviously vanishes if the operator is self adjoint. It also vanishes if the manifold &quot;X&quot; has odd dimension, though there are pseudodifferential elliptic operators whose index does not vanish in odd dimensions.

=== Relation to Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch ===
The Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem was one of the main motivations behind the index theorem because the index theorem is the counterpart of this theorem in the setting of real manifolds. Now, if there&#x27;s a map formula_41 of compact stably almost complex manifolds, then there is a commutative diagram
:formula_42
if formula_43 is a point, then we recover the statement above. Here formula_44 is the Grothendieck group of complex vector bundles. This commutative diagram is formally very similar to the GRR theorem because the cohomology groups on the right are replaced by the Chow ring of a smooth variety, and the Grothendieck group on the left is given by the Grothendieck group of algebraic vector bundles.

==Extensions of the Atiyah–Singer index theorem==

===Teleman index theorem===
Due to , :

:For any abstract elliptic operator on a closed, oriented, topological manifold, the analytical index equals the topological index.
The proof of this result goes through specific considerations, including the extension of Hodge theory on combinatorial and Lipschitz manifolds , , the extension of Atiyah–Singer&#x27;s signature operator to Lipschitz manifolds , Kasparov&#x27;s K-homology and topological cobordism .

This result shows that the index theorem is not merely a differentiability statement, but rather a topological statement.

===Connes–Donaldson–Sullivan–Teleman index theorem===
Due to , :

:For any quasiconformal manifold there exists a local construction of the Hirzebruch–Thom characteristic classes.

This theory is based on a signature operator &quot;S&quot;, defined on middle degree differential forms on even-dimensional quasiconformal manifolds (compare ).

Using topological cobordism and K-homology one may provide a full statement of an index theorem on quasiconformal manifolds (see page 678 of ). The work &quot;provides local constructions for characteristic classes based on higher dimensional relatives of the measurable Riemann mapping in dimension two and the Yang–Mills theory in dimension four.&quot;

These results constitute significant advances along the lines of Singer&#x27;s program &quot;Prospects in Mathematics&quot; . At the same time, they provide, also, an effective construction of the rational Pontrjagin classes on topological manifolds. The paper provides a link between Thom&#x27;s original construction of the rational Pontrjagin classes and index theory.

It is important to mention that the index formula is a topological statement. The obstruction theories due to Milnor, Kervaire, Kirby, Siebenmann, Sullivan, Donaldson show that only a minority of topological manifolds possess differentiable structures and these are not necessarily unique. Sullivan&#x27;s result on Lipschitz and quasiconformal structures shows that any topological manifold in dimension different from 4 possesses such a structure which is unique (up to isotopy close to identity).

The quasiconformal structures and more generally the &quot;L&quot;&quot;p&quot;-structures, 
&quot;p&quot; &gt; &quot;n&quot;(&quot;n&quot;+1)/2, introduced by M. Hilsum , are the weakest analytical structures on topological manifolds of dimension &quot;n&quot; for which the index theorem is known to hold.

===Other extensions===
*The Atiyah–Singer theorem applies to elliptic pseudodifferential operators in much the same way as for elliptic differential operators. In fact, for technical reasons most of the early proofs worked with pseudodifferential rather than differential operators: their extra flexibility made some steps of the proofs easier.
*Instead of working with an elliptic operator between two vector bundles, it is sometimes more convenient to work with an &quot;elliptic complex&quot; formula_45 of vector bundles. The difference is that the symbols now form an exact sequence (off the zero section). In the case when there are just two non-zero bundles in the complex this implies that the symbol is an isomorphism off the zero section, so an elliptic complex with 2 terms is essentially the same as an elliptic operator between two vector bundles. Conversely the index theorem for an elliptic complex can easily be reduced to the case of an elliptic operator: the two vector bundles are given by the sums of the even or odd terms of the complex, and the elliptic operator is the sum of the operators of the elliptic complex and their adjoints, restricted to the sum of the even bundles.
*If the manifold is allowed to have boundary, then some restrictions must be put on the domain of the elliptic operator in order to ensure a finite index. These conditions can be local (like demanding that the sections in the domain vanish at the boundary) or more complicated global conditions (like requiring that the sections in the domain solve some differential equation). The local case was worked out by Atiyah and Bott, but they showed that many interesting operators (e.g., the signature operator) do not admit local boundary conditions. To handle these operators, Atiyah, Patodi and Singer introduced global boundary conditions equivalent to attaching a cylinder to the manifold along the boundary and then restricting the domain to those sections that are square integrable along the cylinder. This point of view is adopted in the proof of of the Atiyah–Patodi–Singer index theorem.
*Instead of just one elliptic operator, one can consider a family of elliptic operators parameterized by some space &quot;Y&quot;. In this case the index is an element of the K-theory of &quot;Y&quot;, rather than an integer. If the operators in the family are real, then the index lies in the real K-theory of &quot;Y&quot;. This gives a little extra information, as the map from the real K-theory of &quot;Y&quot; to the complex K-theory is not always injective.
*If there is a group action of a group &quot;G&quot; on the compact manifold &quot;X&quot;, commuting with the elliptic operator, then one replaces ordinary K-theory with equivariant K-theory. Moreover, one gets generalizations of the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem, with terms coming from fixed-point submanifolds of the group &quot;G&quot;. See also: equivariant index theorem.
* showed how to extend the index theorem to some non-compact manifolds, acted on by a discrete group with compact quotient. The kernel of the elliptic operator is in general infinite dimensional in this case, but it is possible to get a finite index using the dimension of a module over a von Neumann algebra; this index is in general real rather than integer valued. This version is called the &quot;L&quot;2 index theorem, and was used by to rederive properties of the discrete series representations of semisimple Lie groups.
*The Callias index theorem is an index theorem for a Dirac operator on a noncompact odd-dimensional space. The Atiyah–Singer index is only defined on compact spaces, and vanishes when their dimension is odd. In 1978 Constantine Callias, at the suggestion of his Ph.D. advisor Roman Jackiw, used the axial anomaly to derive this index theorem on spaces equipped with a Hermitian matrix called the Higgs field. The index of the Dirac operator is a topological invariant which measures the winding of the Higgs field on a sphere at infinity. If &quot;U&quot; is the unit matrix in the direction of the Higgs field, then the index is proportional to the integral of &quot;U&quot;(&quot;dU&quot;)&quot;n&quot;−1 over the (&quot;n&quot;−1)-sphere at infinity. If &quot;n&quot; is even, it is always zero.
**The topological interpretation of this invariant and its relation to the Hörmander index proposed by Boris Fedosov, as generalized by Lars Hörmander, was published by Raoul Bott and Robert Thomas Seeley.

==Examples==

===Chern-Gauss-Bonnet theorem===
Suppose that formula_46 is a compact oriented manifold of dimension formula_47. If we take formula_48 to be the sum of the even exterior powers of the cotangent bundle, and formula_49 to be the sum of the odd powers, define formula_50, considered as a map from formula_48 to formula_49. Then the analytical index of formula_11 is the Euler characteristic formula_54 of the Hodge cohomology of formula_46, and the topological index is the integral of the Euler class over the manifold. The index formula for this operator yields the Chern–Gauss–Bonnet theorem.

The concrete computation goes as follows: according to one variation of the splitting principle, if formula_12 is a real vector bundle of dimension formula_47, in order to prove assertions involving characteristic classes, we may suppose that there are complex line bundles formula_58 such that formula_59. Therefore, we can consider the Chern roots formula_60, formula_61, formula_62.

Using Chern roots as above and the standard properties of the Euler class, we have that formula_63. As for the Chern character and the Todd class,
:formula_64

Applying the index theorem, 
:formula_65
which is the &quot;topological&quot; version of the Chern-Gauss-Bonnet theorem (the geometric one being obtained by applying the Chern-Weil homomorphism).

===Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem===
Take &quot;X&quot; to be a complex manifold of (complex) dimension &quot;n&quot; with a holomorphic vector bundle &quot;V&quot;. We let the vector bundles &quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot; be the sums of the bundles of differential forms with coefficients in &quot;V&quot; of type (0, &quot;i&quot;) with &quot;i&quot; even or odd, and we let the differential operator &quot;D&quot; be the sum

:formula_66

restricted to &quot;E&quot;. 

This derivation of the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem is more natural if we use the index theorem for elliptic complexes rather than elliptic operators. We can take the complex to be

:formula_67

with the differential given by formula_68. Then the &quot;i&quot;&#x27;th cohomology group is just the coherent cohomology group H&quot;i&quot;(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;V&quot;), so the analytical index of this complex is the holomorphic Euler characteristic of &quot;V&quot;:

:formula_69

Since we are dealing with complex bundles, the computation of the topological index is simpler. Using Chern roots and doing similar computations as in the previous example, the Euler class is given by formula_70 and

:formula_71

Applying the index theorem, we obtain the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem:
:formula_72

In fact we get a generalization of it to all complex manifolds: Hirzebruch&#x27;s proof only worked for projective complex manifolds &quot;X&quot;.

===Hirzebruch signature theorem===
The Hirzebruch signature theorem states that the signature of a compact oriented manifold &quot;X&quot; of dimension 4&quot;k&quot; is given by the L genus of the manifold. This follows from the Atiyah–Singer index theorem applied to the following signature operator.

The bundles &quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot; are given by the +1 and −1 eigenspaces of the operator on the bundle of differential forms of &quot;X&quot;, that acts on &quot;k&quot;-forms as formula_73 times the Hodge star operator. The operator &quot;D&quot; is the Hodge Laplacian

:formula_74

restricted to &quot;E&quot;, where d is the Cartan exterior derivative and d* is its adjoint.

The analytic index of &quot;D&quot; is the signature of the manifold &quot;X&quot;, and its topological index is the L genus of &quot;X&quot;, so these are equal.

===Â genus and Rochlin&#x27;s theorem===
The Â genus is a rational number defined for any manifold, but is in general not an integer. Borel and Hirzebruch showed that it is integral for spin manifolds, and an even integer if in addition the dimension is 4 mod 8. This can be deduced from the index theorem, which implies that the Â genus for spin manifolds is the index of a Dirac operator. The extra factor of 2 in dimensions 4 mod 8 comes from the fact that in this case the kernel and cokernel of the Dirac operator have a quaternionic structure, so as complex vector spaces they have even dimensions, so the index is even.

In dimension 4 this result implies Rochlin&#x27;s theorem that the signature of a 4-dimensional spin manifold is divisible by 16: this follows because in dimension 4 the Â genus is minus one eighth of the signature.

==Proof techniques==

===Pseudodifferential operators===

Pseudodifferential operators can be explained easily in the case of constant coefficient operators on Euclidean space. In this case, constant coefficient differential operators are just the Fourier transforms of multiplication by polynomials, and constant coefficient pseudodifferential operators are just the Fourier transforms of multiplication by more general functions.

Many proofs of the index theorem use pseudodifferential operators rather than differential operators. The reason for this is that for many purposes there are not enough differential operators. For example, a pseudoinverse of an elliptic differential operator of positive order is not a differential operator, but is a pseudodifferential operator. 
Also, there is a direct correspondence between data representing elements of K(B(&quot;X&quot;), &quot;S&quot;(&quot;X&quot;)) (clutching functions) and symbols of elliptic pseudodifferential operators.

Pseudodifferential operators have an order, which can be any real number or even −∞, and have symbols (which are no longer polynomials on the cotangent space), and elliptic differential operators are those whose symbols are invertible for sufficiently large cotangent vectors. Most versions of the index theorem can be extended from elliptic differential operators to elliptic pseudodifferential operators.

===Cobordism===
The initial proof was based on that of the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem (1954), and involved cobordism theory and pseudodifferential operators.

The idea of this first proof is roughly as follows. Consider the ring generated by pairs (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;V&quot;) where &quot;V&quot; is a smooth vector bundle on the compact smooth oriented manifold &quot;X&quot;, with relations that the sum and product of the ring on these generators are given by disjoint union and product of manifolds (with the obvious operations on the vector bundles), and any boundary of a manifold with vector bundle is 0. This is similar to the cobordism ring of oriented manifolds, except that the manifolds also have a vector bundle. The topological and analytical indices are both reinterpreted as functions from this ring to the integers. Then one checks that these two functions are in fact both ring homomorphisms. In order to prove they are the same, it is then only necessary to check they are the same on a set of generators of this ring. Thom&#x27;s cobordism theory gives a set of generators; for example, complex vector spaces with the trivial bundle together with certain bundles over even dimensional spheres. So the index theorem can be proved by checking it on these particularly simple cases.

===K-theory===
Atiyah and Singer&#x27;s first published proof used K-theory rather than cobordism. If &quot;i&quot; is any inclusion of compact manifolds from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;Y&quot;, they defined a &#x27;pushforward&#x27; operation &quot;i&quot;! on elliptic operators of &quot;X&quot; to elliptic operators of &quot;Y&quot; that preserves the index. By taking &quot;Y&quot; to be some sphere that &quot;X&quot; embeds in, this reduces the index theorem to the case of spheres. If &quot;Y&quot; is a sphere and &quot;X&quot; is some point embedded in &quot;Y&quot;, then any elliptic operator on &quot;Y&quot; is the image under &quot;i&quot;! of some elliptic operator on the point. This reduces the index theorem to the case of a point, where it is trivial.

===Heat equation===
 gave a new proof of the index theorem using the heat equation, see e.g. . 
The proof is also published in and .

If &quot;D&quot; is a differential operator with adjoint &quot;D*&quot;, then &quot;D*D&quot; and &quot;DD*&quot; are self adjoint operators whose non-zero eigenvalues have the same multiplicities. However their zero eigenspaces may have different multiplicities, as these multiplicities are the dimensions of the kernels of &quot;D&quot; and &quot;D*&quot;. Therefore, the index of &quot;D&quot; is given by 
:formula_75

for any positive &quot;t&quot;. The right hand side is given by the trace of the difference of the kernels of two heat operators. These have an asymptotic expansion for small positive &quot;t&quot;, which can be used to evaluate the limit as &quot;t&quot; tends to 0, giving a proof of the Atiyah–Singer index theorem. The asymptotic expansions for small &quot;t&quot; appear very complicated, but invariant theory shows that there are huge cancellations between the terms, which makes it possible to find the leading terms explicitly. These cancellations were later explained using supersymmetry.

<doc id="324753" wikidata="Q1427544" url="?curid=324753" title="Lackey (manservant)">
<text>A lackey or lacquey, in its original definition (attested 1529, according to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;), is a uniformed manservant.

The modern connotation of &quot;servile follower&quot; appeared later, in 1588 (&quot;OED&quot;).

==Etymology==
There are several theories about the origins of the word. By one theory, it is derived from Medieval French &quot;laquais&quot;, &quot;foot soldier, footman, servant&quot;, ultimately from Turkish &quot;ulak&quot;, literally &quot;a messenger&quot;. The word also exists in German, where &quot;Lakai&quot; denotes a liveried manservant in the services of a monarch or prince.

==Usage in popular culture==
Lackey is typically used as a derogatory term for a servant with little or no self-respect who belittles himself in order to gain an advantage. Such advantage is often assumed to be slight, temporary and often illusory.

<doc id="324754" wikidata="Q154691" url="?curid=324754" title="Carlos Fuentes">
<text>Carlos Fuentes Macías (; ; November 11, 1928 – May 15, 2012) was a Mexican novelist and essayist. Among his works are &quot;The Death of Artemio Cruz&quot; (1962), &quot;Aura&quot; (1962), &quot;Terra Nostra&quot; (1975), &quot;The Old Gringo&quot; (1985) and &quot;Christopher Unborn&quot; (1987). In his obituary, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Fuentes as &quot;one of the most admired writers in the Spanish-speaking world&quot; and an important influence on the Latin American Boom, the &quot;explosion of Latin American literature in the 1960s and &#x27;70s&quot;, while &quot;The Guardian&quot; called him &quot;Mexico&#x27;s most celebrated novelist&quot;. His many literary honors include the Miguel de Cervantes Prize as well as Mexico&#x27;s highest award, the Belisario Domínguez Medal of Honor (1999). He was often named as a likely candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature, though he never won.

==Life and career==
Fuentes was born in Panama City, the son of Berta Macías and Rafael Fuentes, the latter of whom was a Mexican diplomat. As the family moved for his father&#x27;s career, Fuentes spent his childhood in various Latin American capital cities, an experience he later described as giving him the ability to view Latin America as a critical outsider. From 1934 to 1940, Fuentes&#x27; father was posted to the Mexican Embassy in Washington, D.C., where Carlos attended English-language school, eventually becoming fluent. He also began to write during this time, creating his own magazine, which he shared with apartments on his block.

In 1938, Mexico nationalized foreign oil holdings, leading to a national outcry in the U.S.; he later pointed to the event as the moment in which he began to understand himself as Mexican. In 1940, the Fuentes family was transferred to Santiago, Chile. There, he first became interested in socialism, which would become one of his lifelong passions, in part through his interest in the poetry of Pablo Neruda. He lived in Mexico for the first time at the age of 16, when he went to study law at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in Mexico City with an eye toward a diplomatic career. During this time, he also began working at the daily newspaper &quot;Hoy&quot; and writing short stories. He later attended the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva.

In 1957, Fuentes was named head of cultural relations at the Secretariat of Foreign Affairs. The following year, he published &quot;Where the Air Is Clear&quot;, which immediately made him a &quot;national celebrity&quot; and allowed him to leave his diplomatic post to write full-time. In 1959, he moved to Havana in the wake of the Cuban Revolution, where he wrote pro-Castro articles and essays. The same year, he married Mexican actress Rita Macedo. Considered &quot;dashingly handsome&quot;, Fuentes also had high-profile affairs with actresses Jeanne Moreau and Jean Seberg, who inspired his novel &quot;&quot;. His second marriage, to journalist Silvia Lemus, lasted until his death.

Fuentes served as Mexico&#x27;s ambassador to France from 1975 to 1977, resigning in protest of former President Gustavo Díaz Ordaz&#x27;s appointment as ambassador to Spain. He also taught at Cambridge, Brown, Princeton, Harvard, Columbia, University of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth, and Cornell. His friends included Luis Buñuel, William Styron, Friedrich Dürrenmatt, and sociologist C. Wright Mills, to whom he dedicated his book &quot;The Death of Artemio Cruz&quot;. Once good friends with Nobel-winning Mexican poet Octavio Paz, Fuentes became estranged from him in the 1980s in a disagreement over the Sandinistas, whom Fuentes supported. In 1988, Paz&#x27;s magazine &quot;Vuelta&quot; carried an attack by Enrique Krauze on the legitimacy of Fuentes&#x27; Mexican identity, opening a feud between Paz and Fuentes that lasted until Paz&#x27;s 1998 death. In 1989, he was the subject of a full-length PBS television documentary, &quot;Crossing Borders: The Journey of Carlos Fuentes,&quot; which also aired in Europe and was broadcast repeatedly in Mexico.

Fuentes fathered three children, only one of whom survived him: Cecilia Fuentes Macedo, born in 1962. A son, Carlos Fuentes Lemus, died from complications associated with hemophilia in 1999 at the age of 25. A daughter, Natasha Fuentes Lemus (born August 31, 1974), died of an apparent drug overdose in Mexico City on August 22, 2005, at the age of 30.

==Writing==
Carlos Fuentes has been called &quot;the Balzac of Mexico&quot;. Fuentes himself cited Miguel de Cervantes, William Faulkner and Balzac as the most important writers to him. He also named Latin American writers such as Alejo Carpentier, Juan Carlos Onetti, Miguel Angel Asturias and Jorge Luis Borges. European modernists James Joyce, Virginia Woolf and Marcel Proust have also been cited as important influences on his writing, with Fuentes applying the influence from them on his main theme; Mexican history and identity.

Fuentes described himself as a pre-modern writer, using only pens, ink and paper. He asked, &quot;Do words need anything else?&quot; Fuentes said that he detested those authors who from the beginning claim to have a recipe for success. In a speech on his writing process, he related that when he began the writing process, he began by asking, &quot;Who am I writing for?&quot;

===Early works===
Fuentes&#x27; first novel, &quot;Where the Air Is Clear&quot; (&quot;La región más transparente&quot;), was an immediate success on its publication in 1958. The novel is built around the story of Federico Robles – who has abandoned his revolutionary ideals to become a powerful financier – but also offers &quot;a kaleidoscopic presentation&quot; of vignettes of Mexico City, making it as much a &quot;biography of the city&quot; as of an individual man. The novel was celebrated not only for its prose, which made heavy use of interior monologue and explorations of the subconscious, but also for its &quot;stark portrait of inequality and moral corruption in modern Mexico&quot;.

A year later, he followed with another novel, &quot;The Good Conscience&quot; (&quot;Las Buenas Conciencias&quot;), which depicted the privileged middle classes of a medium-sized town, probably modeled on Guanajuato. Described by a contemporary reviewer as &quot;the classic Marxist novel&quot;, it tells the story of a privileged young man whose impulses toward social equality are suffocated by his family&#x27;s materialism.

===Latin American boom===
Fuentes was regarded as a leading figure of the Latin American boom in the 1960s and 1970s along with Gabriel García Márquez, Mario Vargas Llosa and Julio Cortázar.

Fuentes&#x27; novel, &quot;The Death of Artemio Cruz&quot; (&quot;La muerte de Artemio Cruz&quot;) appeared in 1962 and is &quot;widely regarded as a seminal work of modern Spanish American literature&quot;. Like many of his works, the novel used rotating narrators, a technique critic Karen Hardy described as demonstrating &quot;the complexities of a human or national personality&quot;. The novel is heavily influenced by Orson Welles&#x27; &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, and attempts literary parallels to Welles&#x27; techniques, including close-up, cross-cutting, deep focus, and flashback. Like &quot;Kane&quot;, the novel begins with the titular protagonist on his deathbed; the story of Cruz&#x27;s life is then filled in by flashbacks as the novel moves between past and present. Cruz is a former soldier of the Mexican Revolution who has become wealthy and powerful through &quot;violence, blackmail, bribery, and brutal exploitation of the workers&quot;. The novel explores the corrupting effects of power and criticizes the distortion of the revolutionaries&#x27; original aims through &quot;class domination, Americanization, financial corruption, and failure of land reform&quot;.

A prolific writer, Fuentes subsequent work in the 1960s include the novel &quot;Aura&quot; (1962), the short story collection &quot;Cantar de Ciego&quot; (1966), the novella &quot;Zona Sagrada&quot; (1967) and &quot;A Change of Skin&quot; (1967), an ambitious novel that attempts to define a collective Mexican consciousness by exploring and reinterpreting the country&#x27;s myths.

Fuentes&#x27; 1975 &quot;Terra Nostra&quot;, perhaps his most ambitious novel, is described as a &quot;massive, Byzantine work&quot; that tells the story of all Hispanic civilization. &quot;Terra Nostra&quot; shifts unpredictably between the sixteenth century and the twentieth, seeking the roots of contemporary Latin American society in the struggle between the conquistadors and indigenous Americans. Like &quot;Artemio Cruz&quot;, the novel also draws heavily on cinematic techniques. The novel won the Xavier Villaurrutia Award in 1976 and the Venezuelan Rómulo Gallegos Prize in 1977.

It was followed by &quot;La Cabeza de la hidra&quot; (1978, &quot;The Hydra Head&quot;), a spy thriller set in contemporary Mexico and &quot;Una familia lejana&quot; (1980, &quot;Distant Relations&quot;), a novel that explores many themes including the relations between the Old world and the New.

===Later works===
His 1985 novel &quot;The Old Gringo&quot; (&quot;Gringo viejo&quot;), loosely based on American author Ambrose Bierce&#x27;s disappearance during the Mexican Revolution, became the first U.S. bestseller written by a Mexican author. The novel tells the story of Harriet Winslow, a young American woman who travels to Mexico, and finds herself in the company of an aging American journalist (called only &quot;the old gringo&quot;) and Tomás Arroyo, a revolutionary general. Like many of Fuentes&#x27; works, it explores the way in which revolutionary ideals become corrupted, as Arroyo chooses to pursue the deed to an estate where he once worked as a servant rather than follow the goals of the revolution. In 1989, the novel was adapted into the U.S. film &quot;Old Gringo&quot; starring Gregory Peck, Jane Fonda, and Jimmy Smits. A long profile of Fuentes in the U.S. magazine, &quot;Mother Jones,&quot; describes the filming of &quot;The Old Gringo&quot; in Mexico with Fuentes on the set.

In the mid-1980s Fuentes began to conceptualize his total fiction, past and future, in fourteen cycles called &quot;La Edad del Tiempo&quot;, explaining that his total work is a lengthy reflection on time. The plan for the cycle first appeared as a page in the Spanish edition of his satirical novel &quot;Christopher Unborn&quot; in 1987, and as a page in his subsequent books with minor revisions to the original plan.

In 1992 he published &quot;The Buried Mirror: Reflections on Spain and the New World&quot;, an historical essay that attempts to cover the entire cultural history of Spain and Latin America. The book was a complement to a Discovery Channel and BBC television series by the same name. Fuentes work of nonfiction also include &quot;La nueva novela hispanoamericana&quot; (1969; “The New Hispano-American Novel”), which is his chief work of literary criticism, and &quot;Cervantes; o, la critica de la lectura&quot; (1976; “Cervantes; or, The Critique of Reading”), an homage to the Spanish writer Miguel de Cervantes.

His 1994 book &quot;Diana: The Goddess Who Hunts Alone&quot; is an autobiograpichal novel that portrays the actress Jean Seberg who Fuentes had a love affair with in the 1960s. It was followed by &quot;The Crystal Frontier&quot;, a novel in nine stories.

In 1999 Fuentes published the novel &quot;The Years With Laura Diaz&quot;. A companion book to &quot;The Death of Artemio Cruz&quot;, the characters are from the same period, but the story is told by a woman exiled from her province after the revolution. The novel includes some of Fuentes own family history in Veracruz and has been called &quot;a vast, panoramic novel&quot; dealing with &quot;questions of progress, revolution and modernity&quot; and &quot;the ordinary life of the individual that struggles to find its place&quot;.

His later novels include &quot;Inez&quot; (2001), &quot;The Eagle&#x27;s Throne&quot; (2002) and &quot;Destiny and Desire&quot; (2008). His writing also include several collections of stories, essays and plays.

Fuentes&#x27; works have been translated into 24 languages. He remained prolific to the end of his life, with an essay on the new government of France appearing in &quot;Reforma&quot; newspaper on the day of his death.

Mexican historian Enrique Krauze was a vigorous critic of Fuentes and his fiction, dubbing him a &quot;guerrilla dandy&quot; in a 1988 article for the perceived gap between his Marxist politics and his personal lifestyle. Krauze accused Fuentes of selling out to the PRI government and being &quot;out of touch with Mexico&quot;, exaggerating its people to appeal to foreign audiences: &quot;There is the suspicion in Mexico that Fuentes merely uses Mexico as a theme, distorting it for a North American public, claiming credentials that he does not have.&quot; The essay, published in Octavio Paz&#x27;s magazine &quot;Vuelta&quot;, began a feud between Paz and Fuentes that lasted until Paz&#x27;s death. Following Fuentes&#x27; death, however, Krauze described him to reporters as &quot;one of the most brilliant writers of the 20th Century&quot;.

==Political views==
The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described Fuentes&#x27; politics as &quot;moderate liberal&quot;, noting that he criticized &quot;the excesses of both the left and the right&quot;. Fuentes was a long-standing critic of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) government that ruled Mexico between 1929 and the election of Vicente Fox in 2000, and later of Mexico&#x27;s inability to reduce drug violence. He has expressed his sympathies with the Zapatista rebels in Chiapas. Fuentes was also critical of U.S. foreign policy, including Ronald Reagan&#x27;s opposition to the Sandinistas, George W. Bush&#x27;s anti-terrorism tactics, U.S. immigration policy, and the role of the U.S. in the Mexican Drug War. His politics caused him to be blocked from entering the United States until a Congressional intervention in 1967. Once, after being denied permission to travel to a 1963 New York City book release party, he responded &quot;The real bombs are my books, not me&quot;. Much later in his life, he commented that &quot;The United States is very good at understanding itself, and very bad at understanding others.&quot;

The U.S. State Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation closely monitored Fuentes during the 1960s, purposefully delaying — and often denying — the author&#x27;s visa applications. Fuentes&#x27; FBI file, released on June 20, 2013, reveals that the FBI&#x27;s upper echelons were interested in Fuentes’ movements, because of the writer&#x27;s suspected communist-leanings and criticism of the Vietnam War. Long-time FBI Associate Director Clyde Tolson was copied on several updates about Fuentes.

Initially a supporter of Fidel Castro&#x27;s Cuban Revolution, Fuentes turned against Castro after being branded a &quot;traitor&quot; to Cuba in 1965 for attending a New York conference and the 1971 imprisonment of poet Heberto Padilla by the Cuban government. &quot;The Guardian&quot; described him as accomplishing &quot;the rare feat for a leftwing Latin American intellectual of adopting a critical attitude towards Fidel Castro&#x27;s Cuba without being dismissed as a pawn of Washington.&quot; Fuentes also criticized Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, dubbing him &quot;a tropical Mussolini.&quot;

Fuentes&#x27; last message on Twitter read, &quot;There must be something beyond slaughter and barbarism to support the existence of mankind and we must all help search for it.&quot;

==Death==
On May 15, 2012, Fuentes died in Angeles del Pedregal hospital in southern Mexico City from a massive hemorrhage. He had been brought there after his doctor had found him collapsed in his Mexico City home.

Mexican President Felipe Calderón wrote on Twitter, &quot;I am profoundly sorry for the death of our loved and admired Carlos Fuentes, writer and universal Mexican. Rest in peace.&quot; Nobel laureate Mario Vargas Llosa stated, &quot;with him, we lose a writer whose work and whose presence left a deep imprint&quot;. French President François Hollande called Fuentes &quot;a great friend of our country&quot; and stated that Fuentes had &quot;defended with ardour a simple and dignified idea of humanity&quot;. Salman Rushdie tweeted &quot;RIP Carlos my friend&quot;.

Fuentes received a state funeral on May 16, with his funeral cortege briefly stopping traffic in Mexico City. The ceremony was held in the Palacio de Bellas Artes and was attended by President Calderón.

<doc id="324764" wikidata="Q315708" url="?curid=324764" title="Louis-Claude Daquin">
<text>Louis-Claude Daquin (or D&#x27;Aquino, d&#x27;Aquin, d&#x27;Acquin; July 4, 1694 – June 15, 1772) was a French composer, writing in the Baroque and Galant styles. He was a virtuoso organist and harpsichordist.

==Life==
Louis-Claude Daquin was born in Paris to a family originating from Italy, where his great-great-grandfather took the name D&#x27;Aquino after converting to Catholicism in the town of Aquino. Louis-Claude&#x27;s parents were Claude Daquin, a painter, and Anne Tiersant, a grand-niece of Rabelais. One of Louis-Claude&#x27;s grand-uncles was a professor of Hebrew at the Collège de France, and another was the principal physician of King Louis XIV.

Daquin was a musical child prodigy. He performed for the court of Louis XIV at the age of six. He was for a while a pupil of Louis Marchand. At the age of 12, he became organist at the Sainte-Chapelle, and in the following year took a similar post at the Church of Petit Saint Antoine. In 1722 he married Denise-Thérèse Quirot.

Louis-Claude Daquin never lacked for work as an organist. In 1727 he was appointed organist at the Church of Saint Paul in Paris, ahead of Jean-Philippe Rameau who was also a candidate. Five years later, Daquin succeeded his teacher Marchand as organist at the Church of the Cordeliers. In 1739 he became organist to King Louis XV at the Chapelle Royale. In 1755 he was made titular organist at Notre-Dame Cathedral, succeeding Guillaume-Antoine Calvière.

By reputation a dazzling performer at the keyboard, Daquin was courted by the aristocracy, and his great expertise at the organ drew large crowds to hear him. He was known for his &quot;unfaltering precision and evenness&quot; at both the harpsichord and organ.

==Compositions==
At the age of eight, he conducted his own choral work &quot;Beatus Vir&quot;.

Daquin&#x27;s surviving music includes four harpsichord suites, the c.1757 &quot;Nouveau livre de noëls&quot; for organ and harpsichord (settings of Christmas carols, which include some of his harpsichord improvisations), a cantata, an &quot;air à boire&quot;, and manuscripts of two &quot;Masses&quot;, a &quot;Te Deum&quot;, a &quot;Miserere&quot;, and &quot;Leçons de Ténèbres&quot;. Among the most famous of his works are the &quot;Swiss Noël&quot; (&quot;Noël Suisse&quot;, No. XII from his &quot;Nouveau livre&quot;) and &quot;The Cuckoo&quot; (&quot;Le coucou&quot;, from his 1735 harpsichord suite, &quot;Pièces de clavecin, Troisième Suite&quot;).

Among technical innovations, his &quot;Trois cadences&quot; for harpsichord contains a triple trill.

===The Noëls===
For Daquin&#x27;s twelve published Noëls, French organist Jean-Claude Duval has sourced the following old texts:
*I. Noel, &quot;sur les jeux d&#x27;Anches sans tremblant&quot;: &quot;«À la venuë de Noël»&quot;
*II Noel, &quot;en dialogue, Duo, Trio, sur le cornet de récit, les tierces du positif et la pédalle de Flûte&quot;: &quot;«Or nous dites Marie»&quot;
*III Noel &quot;en Musette, en Dialogue, et en Duo&quot;: &quot;«Une bergère jolie»&quot;
*IV Noel &quot;en Duo, sur les jeux d&#x27;Anches, sans tremblant&quot;: &quot;«Noël, cette journée»&quot;
*V Noel &quot;en Duo&quot;: &quot;«Je me suis levé»&quot; or &quot;«Ô jour glorieux»&quot;
*VI Noel, &quot;sur les jeux d&#x27;Anches, sans tremblant, et en Duo&quot;: &quot;«Qu&#x27;Adam fut un pauvre homme»&quot;
*VII Noel, &quot;en Trio et en Dialogue, le cornet de récit de la main droitte, la Tierce du Positif de la main gauche&quot;: &quot;«Chrétiens qui suivez l&#x27;Église»&quot;
*VIII Noel &quot;Étranger, sur les jeux d&#x27;anches sans tremblant et en Duo&quot;: &quot;«?»&quot; (foreign carol, perhaps Italian)
*IX Noel, &quot;sur les Flûtes&quot;: &quot;«Noël pour l&#x27;amour de Marie»&quot; and &quot;«Chantons, je vous prie»&quot;
*X Noel, &quot;Grand jeu et Duo&quot;: &quot;«Quand Dieu naquit à Noël»&quot; or &quot;«Bon Joseph, écoutez-moi»&quot;
*XI Noel, &quot;en Récit en Taille, sur la Tierce du Positif, avec la Pédalle de Flûte, et en Duo&quot;: &quot;«Une jeune Pucelle»&quot;
*XII Noel &quot;Suisse, Grand jeu, et Duo&quot;: &quot;«Il est un p&#x27;tit l&#x27;ange»&quot; or &quot;«Ô Dieu de clémence»&quot;

<text>Carafano v. Metrosplash.com, Inc., 339 F.3d 1119 (9th Cir. 2003), is an American legal case dealing with the protection provided an internet service provider under the Communications Decency Act (CDA) United States Code Title 47 section 230(c)(1). It is also known as the Star Trek actress case as the plaintiff, Chase Masterson – whose legal name is Christianne Carafano – is well known for having appeared on &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;. The case demonstrated that the use of an online form with some multiple choice selections does not override the protections against liability for the actions of users or anonymous members of a Web-based service.

== Facts ==

A man in Berlin created a bogus matchmaking profile for Masterson on Matchmaker.com, an online dating service. In the profile, the name &quot;Chase&quot; was used, along with her photograph and home address (even though home addresses are not allowed under Matchmaker.com policies). The man also used a Yahoo! email autoresponder in the profile to provide her physical address and telephone number in response to queries. Masterson requested that Matchmaker remove the profile; they initially refused on the basis that only a profile&#x27;s creator could request its removal. After pressure from Masterson, Matchmaker ultimately agreed and removed the profile two days later. However, during the time that the profile remained online, Masterson received several sexually harassing voice mail messages and a fax which she found &quot;highly threatening and sexually explicit&quot; and &quot;that also threatened her son&quot;. To protect herself, Masterson fled her home, living in hotels and traveling with her son for several months.

== History==

Due to Matchmaker&#x27;s initial refusal to remove the profile after they had been made aware of its existence, Masterson sued the company in California state court on the grounds of defamation of character, misappropriation of the right of publicity, invasion of privacy and negligence. The defendants removed the case to federal district court and brought a motion for summary judgment. The district court judge not only rejected the claim for the service provider immunity under the CDA, but Masterson&#x27;s claims sounding in tort were also thrown out by the court as the service provider had not acted in any willful manner against Masterson and the court found that no duty of care existed between the service provider and Masterson. See &quot;Carafano v. Metrosplash.com Inc.&quot;, 207 F. Supp. 2d 1055 (C.D. Cal. 2002).

Masterson appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The appellate court rejected the plaintiff&#x27;s argument and found no liability on the part of Matchmaker. The court found that Matchmaker is not an &quot;information content provider,&quot; but rather an &quot;interactive computer service&quot; which allows the public to post information on its Web site. Under the Communications Decency Act, &quot;interactive computer services&quot; do not incur liability because users create the actual content. Thus liability rests with the underlying contributor, not the interactive computer service.

<text>Turlough O&#x27;Carolan ( ; 1670 – 25 March 1738) was a blind Celtic harper, composer and singer in Ireland whose great fame is due to his gift for melodic composition.

Although not a composer in the classical sense, Carolan is considered by some to be Ireland&#x27;s national composer. Harpers in the old Irish tradition were still living as late as 1792, and ten, including Arthur O&#x27;Neill, Patrick Quin and Donnchadh Ó hÁmsaigh, attended the Belfast Harp Festival. Ó hÁmsaigh played some of Carolan&#x27;s music, but disliked it for being too modern. Some of Carolan&#x27;s own compositions show influences of the style of continental classical music, whereas others such as &quot;Farewell to Music&quot; reflect a much older style of &quot;Gaelic Harping&quot;.

==Biography==

Carolan was born in 1670 in Nobber, County Meath, where his father was a blacksmith. The family, who were said to be a branch of the Mac Brádaigh sept of County Cavan (Carolan&#x27;s great-grandfather, Shane Grana O&#x27;Carrolan, was chieftain of his sept in 1607), forfeited their estates during the civil wars and moved from Meath in 1684 to Ballyfarnon, County Roscommon, on the invitation of the family of MacDermot Roe of Alderford House. In Roscommon, his father took a job with the MacDermott Roe family. Mrs. MacDermott Roe gave Turlough an education, and he showed talent in poetry. After being blinded by smallpox at the age of eighteen, Carolan was apprenticed by Mrs. MacDermott Roe to a good harper. At the age of twenty-one, being given a horse and a guide, he set out to travel Ireland and compose songs for patrons.

For almost fifty years, Carolan journeyed from one end of Ireland to the other, composing and performing his tunes. One of his earliest compositions was about Brigid Cruise, with whom he was infatuated. Brigid was the teenage daughter of the schoolmaster at the school for the blind attended by Carolan in Cruisetown, Ireland. In 1720, Carolan married Mary Maguire. He was then 50 years of age. Their first family home was a cottage on a parcel of land near the town of Manachain (now Mohill) in County Leitrim, where they settled. They had seven children, six daughters and one son. In 1733 Mary died.

Turlough O&#x27;Carolan died on 25 March 1738. He is buried in the MacDermott Roe family crypt in Kilronan Burial Ground near Ballyfarnon, County Roscommon. The annual O&#x27;Carolan Harp Festival and Summer School commemorates his life and work in Keadue, County Roscommon.

A bronze monument by sculptor Oisin Kelly depicting Turlough O&#x27;Carolan playing his harp was erected on a plinth at the Market Square, Mohill, on 10 August 1986, and was unveiled by Patrick Hillery, President of Ireland.

A statue was erected for him in 2002 at his place of birth, during the Annual O&#x27;Carolan Harp Festival, the first of which was held in Nobber in 1988.

==Music and style==
Carolan composed both songs and instrumental harp music, reflecting various styles of composition. About a third of Carolan&#x27;s surviving music has associated Irish lyrics that survive to this day. These lyrics are largely unknown to the musicians of today, who have for the most part adapted Carolan&#x27;s repertoire to the currently popular Irish fare of jigs and reels.

Modern Irish was the majority language in Ireland during Carolan&#x27;s time. As Carolan did not speak English very well, he composed only one song in English, &quot;Carolan&#x27;s Devotion&quot;. These lyrics can be heard on the album &quot;Carolan&#x27;s Harp&quot;, by The Harp Consort, 1996. Most of Carolan&#x27;s songs were dedicated to and written about specific individual patrons. Many of his tunes are widely performed and appreciated today, and a handful of the songs with known lyrics have been recorded by singers. Among these are Gráinne Yeats (Belfast Harp Festival, 1992) and the singers of Garlic Bread (&quot;O&#x27;Carolan&#x27;s Dream&quot;, 2007) and Ensemble Musica Humana (&quot;Turlough O&#x27;Carolan: a Life in Song&quot;, 2013).

Carolan&#x27;s activities during his career are only partially documented historically. This has led to a lack of accurate information about Carolan and his music, even among Irish musicians. Sometimes, alternate titles or incorrect titles have been applied to songs, creating confusion as to whether the song is Carolan&#x27;s or someone else&#x27;s. Also, some of those who have written about Carolan and his music have made up facts or repeated unfounded stories. For instance, Edward Bunting, who began the work of collecting Carolan&#x27;s pieces, referred to a &quot;very ancient air&quot; the Fairy Queen, saying it &quot;seems to have been the original of Carolan&#x27;s &quot;Fairy Queen&quot;.&quot; He also reported that &quot;the &quot;Fairy Queen&quot; of Carolan was not intended by him for words, but as a piece of music for the harp.&quot; While it is true that Carolan did not write the traditional &quot;Fairy Queen&quot; words, which indeed do exist, the words are not ancient (nor is the entirely different traditional Irish air &quot;The Fairy Queen&quot;), and the words do in fact fit perfectly the original music which Carolan composed for them.

Carolan is said to have typically composed the tune first, as he rode from place to place, then added words later. Many of his songs are designated as &quot;&quot;, an obscure word that Carolan apparently invented or popularized to signify a tribute to a merry host. In return for writing songs in honour of wealthy patrons, Carolan was often welcomed as an honoured guest to stay on their estates. It is said that weddings and funerals were sometimes delayed until he could arrive to perform.

==Publication==
Most of Carolan&#x27;s compositions were not published or even written down in his lifetime. They survived in the repertoires of fiddlers, pipers, and the last of the old Irish harper/singers. They were collected and published during the late 18th century and beyond, largely beginning with the work of Edward Bunting and his assistants in 1792.

A small sampling of Carolan&#x27;s music was published during his lifetime. One of the first such publications was in Neale&#x27;s &quot;A Collection of the Most Celebrated Irish Tunes ...&quot;, Dublin, 1724.

The definitive work containing all 214 of Carolan&#x27;s tunes as identified by Donal O&#x27;Sullivan (1893–1973) is the 1958 edition (2001 reprint) of &quot;Carolan: The Life Times and Music of an Irish Harper&quot;. Partial lyrics (and all known sources of lyrics) are mentioned in the text description of each piece but are not matched to the written music. O&#x27;Sullivan does not include any of the handful of alleged Carolan songs that he considers to be erroneous, such as: &quot;Dermott O&#x27;Doud&quot;, &quot;Planxty Miss Burke&quot;, and &quot;The Snowy-Breasted Pearl&quot;.

A comprehensive edition of Carolan&#x27;s Songs &amp; Airs containing new arrangements for harp of all 214 airs, along with an additional 12 airs from the Appendix of the 2001 edition was published by Caitríona Rowsome in 2011. This book includes an instance of each of Carolan&#x27;s undisputed surviving lyrics and metrically sets the lyrics note-for-note to the sheet music airs. Each of the 226 harp settings in this book are played by the author on a neo-Irish harp (book and 4-CD set). This is the first time that all of Carolan&#x27;s lyrics have been set to the airs and has been welcomed as &quot;a task that has needed doing for many years&quot;. The 4-CD recording is of harp music without vocals, but the book includes sheet music for interested singers. The book also includes an English interpretation of each of Carolan&#x27;s 72 Irish song lyrics. Five of these interpretations take the form of new English lyrics set metrically to the sheet music of &quot;Hewlett&quot;, &quot;Colonel John Irwin&quot;, &quot;John O&#x27;Connor&quot;, &quot;Kean O&#x27;Hara (3rd Air)&quot; and &quot;Sheebeg and Sheemore&quot;.

==Performances==
Since 1967, when Seán O’Riada and the Ceoltóirí Chualann released &quot;Carolan’s Concerto&quot; and 2 other Carolan compositions, there have been hundreds of recordings of Carolan songs released by dozens of artists. Many of these recordings are by such well-known performers as The Chieftains, Planxty, and Patrick Ball, and many others by less well-known artists. Occasionally, an artist who is popular in another area will record a single Carolan song for the sake of variety, such as Steeleye Span&#x27;s &quot;Sheebeg and Sheemore&quot;, John Renbourn&#x27;s &quot;Lament for Owen Roe O&#x27;Neill&quot;, Richard Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Morgan Mawgan&quot; [sic], Stefan Grossman&#x27;s &quot;Blind Mary&quot;, John Williams&#x27; &quot;Mrs. Maxwell&quot;, and many others. Several popular collections by multiple artists have also been issued, including &quot;The Music of O’Carolan&quot; (1993), &quot;Deluxe Anthology of Carolan&quot; (1995), &quot;Celtic Treasure&quot; (1996), and &quot;Celtic Treasure II&quot; (2001). The sheer quantity of these recordings has greatly expanded the number of Carolan pieces known to the public, but the performers do tend to come back to certain songs again and again. Among the most frequently recorded pieces are the following:

&quot;Carolan’s Concerto&quot; (at least 36), &quot;Blind Mary&quot; (at least 23), &quot;Planxty George Brabazon&quot; (also known as &quot;Isle of Skye&quot;; at least 23), &quot;Sheebeg and Sheemore&quot; (at least 23), &quot;Planxty Col. Irwin&quot; (at least 19), &quot;Fanny Power&quot; (at least 19), &quot;Eleanor Plunkett&quot; (at least 18), &quot;The Princess Royal&quot; (also known as &quot;Miss MacDermott&quot; and &quot;The Arethusa&quot;; at least 18), &quot;Carolan&#x27;s Farewell to Music&quot; (at least 18), &quot;Carolan&#x27;s Draught&quot; (at least 17), &quot;Hewlett&quot; (at least 16), and &quot;Stafford&#x27;s Receipt&quot; (at least 16). In addition, innumerable musicians have performed many of Carolan&#x27;s tunes learned from such books as &quot;The Fiddler&#x27;s Fakebook&quot;, which contains some of the above tunes plus &quot;Morgan Magan&quot; and &quot;Planxty Drury&quot;. Also, &quot;O&#x27;Neill’s Music of Ireland&quot; (1903) is still in print and contains over 60 of Carolan&#x27;s tunes, of which far too many to list have made their way into the repertoire of musicians around the world.

In addition, &quot;Carolan&#x27;s Concerto&quot; has been used as a neutral slow march by the Foot Guards of the British Army during the ceremony of Trooping the Colour. Also, some of Carolan&#x27;s compositions have appeared in the role-playing game &quot;FATE&quot;, specifically Captain O&#x27;Kane and The Clergy&#x27;s Lamentation.

Carolan&#x27;s music has frequently been adapted for fingerstyle guitar (primarily steel-string acoustic), often by altering the tuning from standard (EADGBE) to DADGBE (drop D), DADGAD, and CGDGAD, among others. This allows strings to ring out and results in a more harp-like sound. Duck Baker has recorded many Carolan songs in drop D tuning. El McMeen performs almost exclusively in CGDGAD and has recorded many Carolan songs.

Many of these pieces have alternative titles, as fully documented by Donal O&#x27;Sullivan. O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s preferred titles are the ones generally accepted as standard, though quite a few of these titles were devised by O&#x27;Sullivan himself after exhaustive research into the identities of the patrons for whom each song was written.

Additionally, a manuscript compiled in Scotland in 1816 by the MacLean-Clephane sisters was discovered in 1983 and includes at least five other pieces credited to Carolan and other annotated pieces that were &quot;improved by Carolan&quot; or &quot;consistent with Carolan&#x27;s writing to warrant consideration&quot;. These airs are included in the Appendix of the 2001 edition of &quot;Carolan: The Life Times and Music of an Irish Harper&quot; along with detailed research notes. These pieces came to light a decade after the death of Donal O&#x27;Sullivan in 1973, so he never had an opportunity to subject them to the same analysis that he used on the original 214 airs that he originally compiled in 1958. However, to date, no one has disputed the attributions presented in this manuscript. Newly composed harp arrangements for each of these and all the other airs (as well as new Carolan repertoire numbers 215 to 226 for each of the MacLean-Clephane tunes) are included in &quot;The Complete Carolan Songs &amp; Airs&quot; by Caitríona Rowsome. The five pieces that are said to be composed by Carolan rather than simply &quot;improved&quot; are:
*&quot;Athlone&quot; (215)
*&quot;Banks of the Shannon&quot; (216)
*&quot;Farewell to Lough Neaghe&quot; (219)
*&quot;Irish Galloway Tom&quot; (220)
*&quot;The Lamentation of Ireland&quot; (221)

*Polish bands: 2 plus 1 in 1979 and Myslovitz in 1996 recorded songs entitled &quot;Peggy Brown&quot;, said to be a translation of an obscure O&#x27;Carolan lyric by Polish lyricist Ernest Bryll, with different tunes and arrangements: folk and alternative rock, respectively. Neither of these tunes uses an O&#x27;Carolan composition. Both songs were very popular in Poland.

<text>Abagtha () was a court official (or a eunuch) of King Ahasuerus. He is mentioned once in the Book of Esther (). According to this narrative, King Ahasuerus commanded Abagtha and six other officials to parade the Queen Vashti before the king and his ministers in the crown jewels. Her refusal led to her demise and the selection of Esther as the new queen of the Persian Empire.

According to Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones, the name Abagtha seems to be the same as ‘Bigtha’ (Old Persian: Bagadāta, ‘god-given’, ‘whose law is divine’, or ‘gif of god’), but with a prefix, and its etymology may be ‘law received from god’. Alternatively, it may derive from the Avestan word &quot;gabata&quot;, ‘fortunate one’.

In Esther 1:10, Abagtha is referred as a סָרִיס (&quot;sarīs&quot;). This Hebrew word, translated eunuch, can mean a general court official, not only a castrated man. Since Abagtha and the other six officials are spoken of as attending to the king, not to royal women, it is possible that he was not a eunuch in the technical sense.

<text>Eurotra was a machine translation project established and funded by the European Commission from 1978 until 1992.

==History==
In 1976, the European Commission started using the commercially developed machine translation system SYSTRAN with a plan to make it work for further languages than originally developed for (Russian-English and English-French), which however turned out to be difficult. This and the potential in existing systems within European research center, led to the decision in 1978 to start the project Eurotra, first through a preparatory Eurotra Coordination Group. Four years later, the European Commission and coordination group gained the approval of the European Parliament.

The goal of the project as to create machine translation system for the official languages of the European Community, which at the time were Danish, Dutch, German, English, French, Italian, later including Greek, Spanish and Portuguese.

However, as time passed, expectations became tempered; &quot;Fully Automatic High Quality Translation&quot; was not a reasonably attainable goal. The true character of Eurotra was eventually acknowledged to be in fact pre-competitive research rather than prototype development.

The project was motivated by one of the founding principles of the EU: that all citizens had the right to read any and all proceedings of the Commission in their own language. As more countries joined, this produced a combinatorial explosion in the number of language pairs involved, and the need to translate every paper, speech and even set of meeting minutes produced by the EU into the other eight languages meant that translation rapidly became the overwhelming component in the administrative budget. To solve this problem Eurotra was devised.

The project was unusual in that rather than consisting of a single research team, it had member groups distributed around the member countries, organised along language rather than national lines (for example, groups in Leuven and Utrecht worked closely together), and the secretariat was based at the European Commission in Luxembourg.

The actual design of the project was unusual as MT projects go. Older systems, such as SYSTRAN, were heavily dictionary-based, with minor support for rearranging word order. More recent systems have often worked on a probabilistic approach, based on parallel corpora. Eurotra addressed the constituent structure of the text to be translated, going through first a syntactic parse followed by a second parse to produce a dependency structure followed by a final parse with a third grammar to produce what was referred to internally as Intermediate Representation (IR). Since all three modules were implemented as Prolog programs, it would then in principle be possible to put this structure backwards through the corresponding modules for another language to produce a translated text in any of the other languages. However, in practice this was not in fact how language pairs were implemented.

The first &quot;live&quot; translation occupied a 4Mb Microvax running Ultrix and C-Prolog for a complete weekend some time in early 1987. The sentence, translated from English into Danish, was &quot;Japan makes computers&quot;. The main problem faced by the system was the generation of so-called &quot;Parse Forests&quot; - often a large number of different grammar rules could be applied to any particular phrase, producing hundreds, even thousands of (often identical) parse trees. This used up huge quantities of computer store, slowing the whole process down unnecessarily. 

While Eurotra never delivered a &quot;working&quot; MT system, the project made a far-reaching long-term impact on the nascent language industries in European member states, in particular among the southern countries of Greece, Italy, Spain, and Portugal. There is at least one commercial MT system (developed by an academic/commercial consortium in Denmark) derived from Eurotra technology.

<text>The Contemporary English Version or CEV (also known as Bible for Today&#x27;s Family) is a translation of the Bible into English,
published by the American Bible Society. An anglicized version was produced by the British and Foreign Bible Society, which includes metric measurements for the Commonwealth market.

== History ==
The CEV project began as a result of studies conducted by Barclay Newman in 1985 regarding the speech patterns used in books, magazines, newspapers, and television. These studies focused on how English was read and heard. This led to a series of test volumes being published in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Among the volumes published were &quot;Luke Tells the Good News About Jesus&quot; (1987), &quot;The Good News Travels Fast – The Acts of the Apostles&quot; (1988), &quot;A Few Who Dared to Trust God&quot; (1990), and &quot;A Book About Jesus&quot; (1991). In 1991, the 175th anniversary of the American Bible Society, the CEV New Testament was released. The CEV Old Testament was released in 1995. In 1999, the Deuterocanonical books were published.

The CEV is sometimes mischaracterized as a revision of the &quot;Good News Bible&quot;, but is a new translation designed for a lower reading level than the GNB. The American Bible Society continues to promote both translations. Its lower reading level is not intended to dilute script or convey lesser intellect for understanding, it is written reflecting the change of language usage over time, under the principles of its translation.

== Translation principles ==
The translators of the CEV followed three principles. They were that the CEV:
* must be understood by people without stumbling in speech
* must be understood by those with little or no comprehension of &quot;Bible&quot; language, and
* must be understood by all.

The CEV uses gender-neutral language for humanity, though not for God.

The translation simplifies Biblical terminology into more everyday words and phrases. An example can be found in , where the prohibition against committing &quot;adultery&quot; is rendered positively in terms of being &quot;faithful in marriage&quot;.

Moreover, the CEV often paraphrases in order to make the underlying point of a passage clear, rather than directly translating the wording. For example, compare Psalm 127:1 in the (much more literal) New International Version:
:&quot;Unless the LORD builds the house, the builders labor in vain. Unless the LORD watches over the city, the guards stand watch in vain.&quot;
with the much shorter summary given by the CEV:
:&quot;Without the help of the LORD it is useless to build a home or to guard a city.&quot;

Or verses 4 &amp; 5 in the New International Version:
:&quot;Like arrows in the hands of a warrior are children born in one’s youth. Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them. They will not be put to shame when they contend with their opponents in court.&quot;
are rendered in the CEV as:
:&quot;Having a lot of children to take care of you in your old age is like a warrior with a lot of arrows. The more you have, the better off you will be, because they will protect you when your enemies attack with arguments.&quot;
Here, rather than shortening the original, the CEV has introduced new material by way of explanation, such as &#x27;to take care of you in your old age&#x27;.

The CEV translates the Greek phrase &quot;hoi Ioudaioi&quot; (literally, &quot;the Jews&quot;) as &quot;the Jewish leaders,&quot; especially in the Gospel of John (as in John 18:14). The CEV translators believe that the Greek phrase &quot;hoi Ioudaioi&quot; in the Gospel of John primarily refers to the Jewish leadership (as in John 6:41).

==Usages==
* In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks, the American Bible Society published a special booklet titled &quot;God Is Our Shelter and Strength&quot;. The booklet contained passages from the Psalms and other parts of the Bible. This booklet was also published after the Hurricane Katrina disaster in September 2005.
* In October 2005, the Bible Society in Australia launched a project called &quot;SMSBible&quot;, which was the entire CEV in SMS text messages. News reports about the service claimed that the Bible spanned more than 30,000 text messages.

* On October 25, 2005, a church in New Zealand began a project called PodBible to produce an audio version of the CEV available via podcast or webcast.

* In 2009, through the UCCF &#x27;FREE Gospel Project&#x27; 400,000 copies of the book of Mark in CEV were handed out at over 150 universities in the UK.

<doc id="324782" wikidata="Q583544" url="?curid=324782" title="Islam in France">
<text>Islam is a minority religion in France that is followed by around 3 million to 5.7 million people in France, which is around 4% to 10% of the nation&#x27;s population.

In 2023, Muslims made up 10% of the French adult population, according to INSEE.

France&#x27;s Muslim population grew starting in the second half of the 20th century, following immigration from former French colonies and protectorates in Africa and the Middle East.

The majority of Muslims in France belong to the Sunni denomination and are of foreign origins. Sizeable minorities of Shia and non-denominational Muslims also exist. The French overseas region of Mayotte has a majority Muslim population.

According to a survey in which 536 people of Muslim origin participated, 39% of Muslims in France surveyed by the polling group IFOP said they observed Islam&#x27;s five prayers daily in 2008, a steady rise from 31% in 1994, according to the study published in the Catholic daily &quot;La Croix&quot;. Mosque attendance for Friday prayers has risen to 23% in 2008, up from 16% in 1994, while Ramadan observance has reached 70% in 2008 compared to 60% in 1994. Alcohol consumption also declined from 39% to 34%.

==History==

===Early history===


During the conquest of Iberia and the conquest of Gaul, the Umayyad forces would conquer and annex the entirety of the Iberian Peninsula and modern day southern France. Though they would eventually withdraw in 732 AD. However, Septimania remained under Umayyad dominance until 759. During a later battle, the Al Andalusians established the fortress Fraxinetum.

In 838, the &quot;Annales Bertiniani&quot; record that Muslims raided Marseille in southern France, plundered its religious houses and took captive both men and women, clerical and lay, as slaves. In 842, the &quot;Annales&quot; report a raid in the vicinity of Arles. In 869, raiders returned to Arles and captured the archbishop, Roland. They accepted a ransom in return for the archbishop, but when they handed him over he was already dead. The construction of a castle in the Camargue following these raids up the Rhône may have induced raiders to try points further east, culminating in the establishment of a permanent base of operations at Fraxinetum. In 887, Muslim forces from Al-Andalus conquered several bases in France and established the emirate of Fraxinet. They were eventually defeated and expelled in 975.

During the winter of 1543–1544, after the siege of Nice, Toulon was used as an Ottoman naval base under admiral Hayreddin Barbarossa. The Christian population was temporarily evacuated, and Toulon Cathedral was briefly converted into a mosque until the Ottomans&#x27; departure.

After the expulsion of the Moriscos from Spain in 1609–1614, about 50,000 Moriscos entered France, according to the research of Henri Lapeyre.

===1960-1970s labor immigration===
Muslim immigration, mostly male, was high in the late 1960s and 1970s. These immigrants mostly hailed from Algeria and other former French colonies in North Africa; however, Islam has had an older history in France, since the Great Mosque of Paris was built in 1922, as a sign of recognition from the French Republic to the fallen Muslim &quot;tirailleurs&quot; mainly coming from Algeria, in particular at the battle of Verdun and the takeover of the Douaumont fort.

===French Council of the Muslim Faith===
Though the French State is secular, in recent years the government has tried to organize a representation of French Muslims. In 2002, the then Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy initiated the creation of a &quot;French Council of the Muslim Faith&quot; (&quot;Conseil Français du Culte Musulman&quot; – CFCM), though wide criticism claimed this would only encourage communitarianism. Though the CFCM is informally recognized by the national government, it is a private nonprofit association with no special legal status. , it is headed by the rector of the Paris Mosque, Dalil Boubakeur – who harshly criticized the controversial Union of Islamic Organisations of France (UOIF) for involving itself in political matters during the 2005 riots. Sarkozy&#x27;s views on &quot;laïcité&quot; have been widely criticized by left- and right-wing members of parliament; more specifically, he was accused, during the creation of the CFCM, of favoring the more extreme sectors of Muslim representation in the Council, in particular the UOIF.

===Second generation immigrants===
The first generation of Muslim immigrants, who are today mostly retired from the workforce, kept strong ties with their countries, where their families lived. In 1976, the government passed a law allowing families of these immigrants to settle in France. Thus, the spouses, children, and other family members of these immigrants also came to France. Most immigrants, realizing that they could not or did not want to return to their homeland, asked for French nationality before quietly retiring. However, many live alone in housing projects, having now lost their ties with their families and friends back from their home countries.

Olivier Roy indicates that for first-generation immigrants, the fact that they are Muslims is only one element among others. Their identification with their country of origin is much stronger: they see themselves first through their descent (Algerians, Moroccans, Tunisians, etc.).

The false claim that a third of newborns in France have Muslim parents, is brought up in sensationalist American immigration discourse.

===Maghrebis===
According to Michèle Tribalat, a researcher at INED, people of Maghrebi origin in France represent 82% of the Muslim population (43.2% from Algeria, 27.5% from Morocco, and 11.4% from Tunisia). Others are from sub-Saharan Africa (9.3%) and Turkey (8.6%). She estimated that there were 3.5 million people of Maghrebi origin (with at least one grandparent from Algeria, Morocco, or Tunisia) living in France in 2005 corresponding to 5.8% of the total French metropolitan population (60.7 million in 2005). Maghrebis have settled mainly in the industrial regions in France, especially in the Paris region. Many famous French people like Edith Piaf, Isabelle Adjani, Arnaud Montebourg, Alain Bashung, Dany Boon, and many others have varying degrees of Maghrebi ancestry.

Below is a table of the population of Maghrebi origin in France, numbers are in thousands:

In 2005, the percentage of young people under 18 of Maghrebi origin (at least one immigrant parent) was about 7% in Metropolitan France, 12% in Greater Paris and above 20% in French département of Seine-Saint-Denis.

In 2008, the French national institute of statistics, INSEE, estimated that 11.8 million foreign-born immigrants and their direct descendants (born in France) lived in France representing 19% of the country&#x27;s population. About 4 million of them are of Maghrebi origin.

According to some non-scientific sources between 5 and 6 million people of Maghrebin origin live in France corresponding to about 7–9% of the total French metropolitan population.

===Religious practices===
The great majority of Muslims practice their religion in the French framework of laïcité, as a religious code of conduct must not infringe the public area. A study in 2008 found that 39% pray (salat) five times a day, 23% attend mosque on Fridays, 70% observe the fast of Ramadan, and 66% abstain from alcohol. Rachel Brown shows that some Muslims in France alter some of these religious practices, particularly food practices, as a means of showing &quot;integration&quot; into French culture. According to expert Franck Fregosi: &quot;Although fasting during Ramadan is the most popular practice, it ranks more as a sign of Muslim identity than piety, and it is more a sign of belonging to a culture and a community&quot;, and he added that not drinking alcohol &quot;seems to be more a cultural behavior&quot;.

Some Muslims (the UOIF for example) request the recognition of an Islamic community in France (which remains to be built) with an official status.

Two main organizations are recognized by the French Council of Muslim Faith (CFCM): the &quot;Federation of the French Muslims&quot; (&quot;Fédération des musulmans de France&quot;) with a majority of Moroccan leaders, and the controversial &quot;Union of Islamic Organisations of France&quot; (&quot;Union des organizations islamiques de France&quot;) (UOIF). In 2008, there were about 2,125 Muslim places of worship in France.

===Education===
Since publicly funded state schools in France must be secular, owing to the 1905 separation of Church and State, Muslim parents who wish their children to be educated at a religious school often choose private (and therefore fee-paying, though heavily subsidized) Catholic schools, of which there are many. Few specifically Muslim schools have been created. There is a Muslim school in La Réunion (a French island to the east of Madagascar), and the first Muslim &quot;collège&quot; (a school for students aged eleven to fifteen) opened its doors in 2001 in Aubervilliers (a suburb northeast of Paris), with eleven students. Unlike most private schools in the United States and the UK, these religious schools are affordable for most parents since they may be heavily subsidized by the government (teachers&#x27; wages in particular are covered by the state).

===Radicalization===
In November 2015 in the aftermath of the Paris attacks, French authorities for the first time closed three mosques with extremist activities and radicalization being given as the reason. The mosques were located in Lagny-sur-Marne, Lyon, and Gennevilliers. Muslim community leaders widely condemned the Paris attacks in public statements and expressed their support for the French government&#x27;s attempts to oppose Islamist extremism.

Due to the deadly attacks in 2015, France changed the character of Islamist radicalization from a security threat to constitute a societal problem. President François Hollande and prime minister Manuel Valls saw the fundamental values of the French republic being challenged and called them attacks against fundamental secular, enlightenment, and democratic values along with &quot;what makes us who we are&quot;.

In 2016, French authorities reported that 120 of the 2,500 Islamic prayer halls were disseminating Salafist ideas and 20 mosques were closed due to findings of hate speech. In 2016, French authorities stated that of the individuals on the list of security threats belong to Islamist movements.

In 2018, EU anti-terror coordinator Gilles de Kerchove estimated there to be 17,000 radicalized Muslims and jihadists living in France.

In 2018, French intelligence services monitored around 11,000 individuals with suspected ties to radical Islamism. France has sentenced a large number of individuals for terrorist-related offenses which have increased the prison population. This in turn has created an issue with radicalization in French prisons.

In February 2019, authorities in Grenoble closed the Al-Kawthar Mosque for six months due to it propagating a &quot;radical Islamist ideology&quot;. The Al-Kawthar Mosque had about 400 regular visitors. In several of the sermons, the imam legitimized armed jihad, violence, and hatred towards followers of other religions&#x27; anti-republican values and promoted Sharia law.

In November 2019, French authorities closed cafés, schools, and mosques in about 15 neighborhoods due to them disseminating political Islam and communitarian ideas.

In October 2020, President Emmanuel Macron announced a crackdown on &quot;Islamist separatism&quot; in Muslim communities in France, saying a bill with this objective would be sent to parliament in &quot;early 2021.&quot; Among the measures, would be a ban on foreign imams, restrictions on homeschooling, and the creation of an &quot;Institute of Islamology&quot; to tackle Islamic fundamentalism. His government introduced a bill that would punish with jail terms and fine any doctor who provides virginity certificates for traditional, religious marriages. ANCIC stated it supported the government&#x27;s stand against &quot;virginity tests&quot; but warned that in some cases women were in &quot;real danger&quot; and &quot;a ban would simply deny the existence of such community practices, without making them disappear&quot;. The association suggested that the issue be &quot;tackled quite differently so that women and men free themselves and reject the weight of [such] traditions.&quot; On 16 February 2021, the law passed the lower house 347—151 with 65 abstentions.

=== Terrorist attacks in France ===
France had its first occurrences with religious extremism in the 1980s due to French involvement in the Lebanese Civil War. In the 1990s, a series of attacks on French soil were executed by the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria (GIA).

In the 1990–2010 time span, France experienced repeated attacks linked to international jihadist movements. &quot;Le Monde&quot; reported on 26 July 2016 that &quot;Islamist Terrorism&quot; had caused 236 dead in France in the preceding 18-month period.

In the 2015–2018 timespan in France, 249 people were killed and 928 wounded in a total of 22 terrorist attacks.

The deadly attacks in 2015 in France changed the issue of Islamist radicalization from a security threat to also constitute a social problem. Prime minister François Hollande and prime minister Manuel Valls saw the fundamental values of the French republic being challenged and called them attacks against secular, enlightenment and democratic values along with &quot;what makes us who we are&quot;.

Although jihadists in the 2015-onward timeframe legitimized their attacks with a narrative of reprisal for France&#x27;s participation in the international coalition fighting the Islamic State, Islamic terrorism in France has other, deeper and older causes. The main reasons France suffers frequent attacks are, in no particular order:
* France&#x27;s secular domestic policies (&quot;Laïcité&quot;) which jihadists perceive to be hostile towards Islam. Also, France&#x27;s status as an officially secular nation and jihadists label France as &quot;the flagship of disbelief&quot;.
* France has a strong cultural tradition in comics, which in the context of Muhammad cartoons is a question of freedom of expression.
* France has a large Muslim minority
* France&#x27;s foreign policy towards Muslim countries and jihadist fronts. France is seen as the spearhead directed against jihadist groups in Africa, just as the United States is seen as the main force opposing jihadist groups elsewhere. France&#x27;s former foreign policies such as that as its colonization of Muslim countries is also brought up in jihadist propaganda, for example, that the influence of French education, culture and political institutions had served to erase the Muslim identity of those colonies and their inhabitants.
* Jihadists consider France as a strong proponent of disbelief. For instance, Marianne, the national emblem of France, is considered as &quot;a false idol&quot; by jihadists and the French to be &quot;idol worshippers&quot;. France also has no law against blasphemy and an anticlerical satirical press which is less respectful towards religion than that of the US or the United Kingdom. The French nation state is also perceived as an obstacle towards establishing a caliphate.
In 2020 two Islamic terrorist attacks were foiled by authorities, bringing the total to 33 since 2017 according to Laurent Nuñez, the director of CNRLT, who declared that Sunni Islamist terrorism was a prioritised threat. Nuñez drew parallels between the three attacks of 2020 which all were attacks on &quot;blasphemy and the will to avenge their prophet&quot;.

==== Germany ====
In the 2015–2020 time span, there were 9 Islamic terrorist attacks and thwarted terrorist plots where at least one of the perpetrators had entered Germany as an asylum seeker during the European migrant crisis. The Islamic terrorists entered Germany either without identity documents or with falsified documents. The number of discovered plots began to decline in 2017. In 2020 German authorities noted that the majority of the asylum seekers entered Germany without identification papers during the crisis and security agencies considered unregulated immigration as problematic from a security aspect.

=== Law against Islamist extremism ===

=== Investigation on the Influence of Political Islam ===
In May 2024, the French government initiated an investigation aimed at assessing the influence of political Islam and the Muslim Brotherhood in France. The government delegated this task to two senior officials, diplomat François Gouyette and prefect Pascal Courtade. Their work is anticipated to yield a comprehensive report by the fall of 2024. According to a statement from the Ministry of Interior, this effort is in direct alignment with the context of the Les Mureaux (Yvelines) speech on separatism delivered by Emmanuel Macron in 2020, which later led to the 2021 law on the principles and values of the Republic.

==Integration==
===Accepted French citizens===
Notwithstanding the islamist extremists&#x27; terrorist attacks in France, including the Charlie Hebdo and Nice terror attacks, some studies have concluded that France is the European country where Muslims integrate the best and feel the most for their country and that French Muslims have the most positive opinions about their fellow citizens of different faiths. A 2006 study from the Pew Research Center on Integration is one such study. In Paris and the surrounding Île-de-France region where French Muslims tend to be more educated and religious, the vast majority rejects violence and say they are loyal to France according to studies by Euro-Islam, a comparative research network on Islam and Muslims in the West sponsored by GSRL Paris/CNRS France and Harvard University. On the other hand, a 2013 IPSOS survey published by the French daily &quot;Le Monde&quot;, indicated that only 26% of French respondents believed that Islam was compatible with French society (compared to 89% identifying Catholicism as compatible and 75% identifying Judaism as compatible). A 2014 survey by the Pew Research Center showed that out of all Europeans, the French view Muslim minorities most favorably with 72% having a favorable opinion. Other research has shown how these positive attitudes are not always reflected in popular opinion and the subject of Muslim integration in France is much more nuanced and complex.

In April 2018 an Algerian Muslim woman refused to shake hands with an official for religious reasons at a citizenship ceremony. As an applicant must demonstrate being integrated into society as well as respect for French values, officials considered her not integrated and denied her citizenship application.

=== Religiosity ===
According to a poll by Institut français d&#x27;opinion publique in 2020, 46% of Muslims gave the view that their religious beliefs were more important than the values and laws of the French Republic, more than twice the fraction of the French public (17%). Among Muslims under 25 years of age a large majority (74%) considered their religion more important than French laws and values.

=== LGBT acceptance ===
The 2009 Gallup poll showed that 35% of the French Muslims believed that homosexuality is morally acceptable.

=== Unemployment ===
In October 2020, the unemployment among Muslims was far higher at 14% than the population at large (8%).

=== Education ===
According to a poll by Institut Montaigne in 2016, 15% of Muslims in France had no academic qualification at all and 25% had less than secondary education (Baccalauréat). 12% had more than 2 years higher education, a further 20% had more than 2 years. It been estimated that Muslim students form more than 10% of the students in the French Catholic schools.

===Discrimination===

In 2010, a study entitled &quot;Are French Muslims Discriminated Against in Their Own Country?&quot; found that &quot;Muslims sending out resumes in hopes of a job interview had 2.5 times less chance than Christians&quot; with similar credentials &quot;of a positive response to their applications&quot;.

Another example is the 2004 French ban on ostentatious religious signs in public schools for minors, which forced young girls insisting on wearing the hijab in school out of public schools

Other examples of discrimination against Muslims include the desecration of 148 French Muslim graves near Arras. A pig&#x27;s head was hung from a headstone and profanities insulting Islam and Muslims were daubed on some graves. Destruction and vandalism of Muslim graves in France were seen as Islamophobic by a report of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia. Several of Mosques have also been vandalized in France over the years. On 14 January 2015, it was reported that 26 mosques in France had been subject to attack since the Charlie Hebdo shooting in Paris.

On 29 June 2017, a man who had schizophrenia attempted to ram his vehicle into a crowd of worshipers exiting a mosque in Créteil, a suburb of Paris, though no one was injured. Le Parisien claims the suspect, of Armenian origin, wanted to &quot;avenge the Bataclan and Champs-Elysées&quot; attacks.

In 2019, The French Institute for Public Research (IFOP) conducted the study from August 29 to September 18, based on a sample of 1007 Muslims aged 15 and above. According to the study, 40% of Muslims in France felt that they were discriminated against. More than a third of these instances were recorded in the past five years, suggesting an increase in the overall mistreatment of Muslims in France over recent years. The survey found that 60% of women wearing a headscarf were subject to discrimination. 37% of Muslims in France have been a victim of verbal harassment or defamatory insults. The study, however, revealed that 44% of Muslim women who do not wear headscarves found themselves being a victim of verbal harassment or defamatory insults. The survey found that 13% of incidents of religious discrimination happened at police control points and 17% happened at job interviews. 14% of incidents occurred while the victims were looking to rent or buy accommodation. The IFOP stated that 24% of Muslims were exposed to verbal aggression during their lifetime, compared to 9% among non-Muslims. In addition, 7% of Muslims were physically attacked, compared to 3% of non-Muslims.

In 2019, according to the French Ministry of Interior, 154 anti-religious acts targeted Muslims, while those targeting Jews stood at 687, and those against Christians was 1,052. Most of these acts consisted of vandalism of &quot;property of a religious nature.&quot;

=== Public opinion ===
A February 2017 poll of 10 000 people in 10 European countries by Chatham House found on average a majority (55%) were opposed to further Muslim immigration, with opposition especially pronounced in Austria, Poland, Hungary, France and Belgium. Except for Poland, all of those had recently suffered jihadist terror attacks or been at the center of a refugee crisis. A survey published in 2019 by the Pew Research Center found that 72% of French respondents had a favorable view of Muslims in their country, whereas 22% had an unfavourable view.

===Repercussions===
The 2005 French riots have been controversially interpreted as an illustration of the difficulty of integrating Muslims in France, and smaller-scale riots have been occurring throughout the 1980s and 1990s, first in Vaulx-en-Velin in 1979, and in Vénissieux in 1981, 1983, 1990 and 1999.

Furthermore, although Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy claimed that most rioters were immigrants and already known to the police, the majority were, in fact, previously unknown to the police.

In 2014, an analysis by The Washington Post showed that between 60 and 70% of the prison population in France are Muslim or come from Muslim backgrounds while Muslims constitute 12% of the population of France. The claims in this article have been refuted: the headline figure was based on research in 4 Paris and north regions prisons out of a total 188 by Professor Farhad Khosrovkhavar later said his best estimate was 40–50%, but that data is not recorded by French authorities. Statistics on ethnicity and religion are banned in France. In 2013, 18,300 (27%) of the 67,700 French prison population registered for Ramadan, an indication of their religious affiliation.

===Hijab===

The wearing of &quot;hijab&quot; in France has been a very controversial issue since 1989. The debate essentially concerns whether Muslim girls who choose to wear hijab may do so in state schools. A secondary issue is how to protect the free choice and other rights of young Muslim women who do not want the veil, but who may face strong pressure from families or some traditionalists. Similar issues exist for civil servants and the acceptance of male Muslim medics in medical services.

In 1994, the French Ministry for Education sent out recommendations to teachers and headmasters to ban the veil in educational institutions. According to a 2019 study by the Institute of Labor Economics, more girls with a Muslim background born after 1980 graduated from high school after the 1994 restrictions were introduced. While secularism is often criticized for restricting freedom of religion, the study suggested that &quot;public schools ended up promoting the educational empowerment of some of the most disadvantaged groups of female students&quot;.

Leila Babes in her book &quot;The Veil Demystified&quot;, believe that wearing the veil does not derive from a Muslim religious imperative.

The French government and a large majority of public opinion are opposed to the wearing of a &quot;conspicuous&quot; sign of religious expression (dress or symbol), whatever the religion, as this is incompatible with the French system of &quot;laïcité&quot;. In December 2003, President Jacques Chirac said that it breaches the separation of church and state and would increase tensions in France&#x27;s multicultural society, whose Muslim and Jewish populations are both the biggest of their kind in Western Europe.

The issue of Muslim hijabs has sparked controversy after several girls refused to uncover their heads in class, as early as 1989. In October 1989, three Muslim schoolgirls wearing the Islamic headscarf were expelled from the &quot;collège Gabriel-Havez&quot; in Creil (north of Paris). In November, the First Conseil d&#x27;État ruling affirmed that the wearing of the Islamic headscarf, as a symbol of freedom of religious expression, in public schools was not incompatible with the French school system and the system of &quot;laïcité&quot;. In December, a first ministerial circular (&quot;circulaire Jospin&quot;) was published, stating teachers had to decide on a case-by-case basis whether to ban the wearing of Islamic headscarves.

In January 1990, three schoolgirls were expelled from the &quot;collège Pasteur&quot; in Noyon, north of Paris. The parents of one expelled schoolgirl filed a defamation action against the principal of the &quot;collège Gabriel-Havez&quot; in Creil. As a result, the teachers of a &quot;collège&quot; in Nantua (eastern part of France, just to the west of Geneva, Switzerland) went on strike to protest the wearing of the Islamic headscarf in school. A second ministerial circular was published in October, to restate the need to respect the principle of &quot;laïcité&quot; in public schools.

In September 1994, a third ministerial circular (&quot;circulaire Bayrou&quot;) was published, making a distinction between &quot;discreet&quot; symbols to be tolerated in public schools, and &quot;ostentatious&quot; symbols, including the Islamic headscarf, to be banned from public schools. In October, some students demonstrated at the &quot;lycée Saint Exupéry&quot; in Mantes-la-Jolie (northwest of Paris) to support the freedom to wear Islamic headscarves in school. In November, approximately twenty-four veiled schoolgirls were expelled from the &quot;lycée Saint Exupéry&quot; in Mantes-la-Jolie and the &quot;lycée Faidherbe&quot; in Lille.

In December 2003, President Chirac decided that the law should prohibit the wearing of visible religious signs in schools, according to &quot;laïcité&quot; requirements. The law was approved by parliament in March 2004. Items prohibited by this law include hijabs, Jewish yarmulkes, or large Christian crosses. It is still permissible to wear discreet symbols of faith such as small crosses, Stars of David, or Fatima&#x27;s hands.

Two French journalists working in Iraq, Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot were taken hostage by the &quot;Islamic Army in Iraq&quot; (an Iraqi resistance militant movement) under accusations of spying. Threats to kill the two journalists if the law on headscarves was not revoked were published on the Internet by groups claiming to be the &quot;Islamic Army in Iraq&quot;. The two journalists were later released unharmed.

The arguments resurfaced when, on 22 June 2009, at the &quot;Congrès de Versailles&quot;, President Nicolas Sarkozy declared that the Islamic burqa is not welcome in France, claiming that the full-length, body-covering gown was a symbol of subservience that suppresses women&#x27;s identities and turns them into &quot;prisoners behind a screen.&quot; A parliamentary commission of thirty-two deputies led by André Gerin (PCF), was also formed to study the possibility of banning the public wearing of the burqa or niqab. There is suspicion, however, that Sarkozy is &quot;playing politics in a time of economic unhappiness and social anxiety.&quot;

A Muslim group spokesman expressed serious concern over the proposed legislation, noting that &quot;even if they ban the burqa, it will not stop there,&quot; adding that &quot;there is a permanent demand for legislating against Muslims. This could go really bad, and I&#x27;m scared of it. I feel like they&#x27;re turning the screws on us.&quot;

On 25 January 2010 it was announced that the parliamentary committee, having concluded its study, would recommend that a ban on veils covering the face in public locations such as hospitals and schools be enacted, but not in private buildings or on the street.

In February 2019, Decathlon, Europe&#x27;s largest sports retailer, announced plans to begin selling a sports hijab in their stores in France. Decathlon had begun selling the product in Morocco the previous week, but the plan was criticized on social media, with several politicians expressing discomfort with the product being sold. Decathlon originally stood firm, arguing it was focused on &quot;democratizing&quot; sports. The company released a statement saying its goal was to &quot;offer them a suitable sports product, without judging.&quot; While Nike had already sold hijabs in France, Decathlon was met with much more scrutiny. Multiple salespeople were threatened physically in stores. The company also received hundreds of calls and emails in regard to the product. Decathlon was forced to backtrack and has since halted its plans to sell the sports hijab. Many throughout France were left disappointed with one Muslim entrepreneur, who didn&#x27;t consider selling sport hijabs, stating, &quot;it&#x27;s a shame that Decathlon didn&#x27;t stand firm.&quot;

===Politics===
Formal as well as informal Muslim organizations help the new French citizens to integrate. Several political parties like Parti égalité et Justice have now appeared. Their most frequent activities are homework help and language classes in Arabic, ping pong, Muslim discussion groups etc. are also common. However, most important associations active in assisting with the immigration process are either secular (GISTI, for example) or ecumenist (such as the protestant-founded Cimade).

The most important national institution is the CFCM (&quot;Conseil Français du Culte Musulman&quot;) this institution was designed on the model of the &quot;Consistoire Juif de France&quot; and of the &quot;Fédération protestante de France&quot; both Napoleonic creations. The aim of the CFCM (like its Jewish and protestant counterparts) is to discuss religious problem with the state, participate in certain public institutions, and organize the religious life of French Muslims. The CFCM is elected by the French Muslims through local election. It is the only official instance of the French Muslims.

There were four organizations represented in the CFCM elected in 2003, GMP (Grande mosquée de Paris), UOIF (Union des organizations islamiques de France), FNMF (Fédération nationale des musulmans de France) CCMTF (Comité de coordination des musulmans Turcs de France). In 2008 a new council was elected. The winner was RMF (Rassemblement des musulmans de France) with a large majority of the votes, followed by the UOIF and the CCMTF. It is a very broad and young organization and there is a beginning of consensus on major issues. Other elections took place since then, the latest was due in 2019 but is still pending.

Other organizations exist, such as PCM (Muslim Participation and Spirituality), which combine political mobilization (against racism, sexism etc.) and spiritual meetings, and put emphasis on the need to get involved in French society – by joining organizations, registering to vote, working with your children&#x27;s schools etc. They do not have clear-cut political positions as such but push for active citizenship. They are vaguely on the left in practice.

The government has yet to formulate an official policy towards making integration easier. As mentioned above, it is difficult to determine in France who may be called a Muslim. Some Muslims in France describe themselves as &quot;non-practicing&quot;. Most simply observe &quot;Ramadan&quot; and other basic rules but are otherwise secular.

==Statistics==
Due to a law dating from 1872, the French Republic prohibits performing census by making distinction between its citizens regarding their race or their beliefs. However, that law does not concern surveys and polls, which are free to ask those questions if they wish. The law also allows for an exception for public institutions such as INED or INSEE whose job it is to collect data on demographics, social trends and other related subjects, on condition that the collection of such data has been authorized by the CNIL and the National Council of Statistical Information ().

===Estimations based on declaration===
Surveys from INED and the INSEE in October 2010 concluded that France has 2.1 million &quot;declared Muslims&quot;. In 1960, there was approximately 400,000 Muslims in France, corresponding to 0.9% of the population at the time.

In 2023, Muslims made up 10% of the French adult population, according to INSEE.

===Estimations based on people&#x27;s geographic origin===
According to the French Government, which does not have the right to ask direct questions about religion and uses a criterion of people&#x27;s geographic origin as a basis for calculation, there were between 3 and 3.2 million Muslims in metropolitan France in 2010. Thirteen years later, the proportion of Muslims in France rose to 10%, according to INSEE.

The government counted all those people in France who migrated from countries with a dominant Muslim population, or whose parents did.

The United States Department of State placed it at roughly 10%, while two 2007 polls estimated it at about 3% of the total population. The CIA World Factbook places it at 7–9%.

A Pew Forum study, published in January 2011, estimated 4.7 million Muslims in France in 2010 (and forecasted 6.9 million in 2030).

The French polling company IFOP estimated in 2016 that French Muslims number between 3 and 4 million and criticized suggestions of a significant demographic religious slide (the so-called Great Replacement conspiracy theory, ). IFOP claims that they make up 5.6% of those older than 15, and 10% of those younger than 25. According to an IFOP survey for the newspaper &quot;La Croix&quot; in 2011, based on a combination of previous surveys, 75% of people from families &quot;of Muslim origin&quot; said they were believers. This is more than the previous study in 2007 (71%) but less than the one before 2001 (78%). This variation, caused by the declarative aspect of the survey, illustrates the difficulty of establishing precisely the number of believers. According to the same survey 155 of those surveyed who had at-least one Muslim parent 84.8% identified as Muslims, 3.4% identified as Christians, 10.0% identified as not religious and 1.3% belonged to other religions.

An Interior ministry source in &quot;l&#x27;Islam dans la République&quot; published the following estimated distribution of Muslims by Alain Boyer by affiliated countries in 1999:
In 2008, thirty-nine percent of Muslims surveyed by the polling group IFOP said they observed Islam&#x27;s five prayers daily, a steady rise from 31 percent in 1994, according to the study published in the Catholic daily La Croix.

Mosque attendance for Friday prayers has risen to 23 percent, in 2008 up from 16 percent in 1994, while in 2008 Ramadan observance has reached 70 percent compared to 60 percent in 1994, it said. Drinking alcohol, which Islam forbids, has also declined to 34 percent from 39 percent in 1994, according to the survey of 537 people of Muslim origin.

A 2015 study found that up to 12,000 French Muslims converted to Christianity, but cited that this number may be underestimated, and it may include only Protestant converts.

According to , a researcher at INED, an acceptance of 5 to 6 million Muslims in France in 1999 was overestimated. Her work has shown that there were 3.7 million people of &quot;possible Muslim faith&quot; in France in 1999 (6.3% of the total population of Metropolitan France). In 2009, she estimated that the number of people of the Muslim faith in France was about 4.5 million.

According to Jean-Paul Gourévitch, there were 8.5 million of Muslim origin (about 1/8 of the population), in metropolitan France in 2017.

In 2017, François Héran, former Head of the Population Surveys Branch at INSEE and Director of INED (French National Institute for Demographic Research) between 1999 and 2009, stated that about one eighth of the French population was of Muslim origin in 2017 (8.4 million).

According to the latest Special Eurobarometer 493 (2019) the Muslim population in France is estimated to be 5% or 3.35 million.

Pew Research Center predicts the Muslim population would rise to 8.6 million or 12.7 percent of the country in 2050 with zero immigration, and 13.2 million or 18.0 percent with high immigration.

=== Converts ===
In 2013, The New York Times quoted Bernard Godard, a former French intelligence official specializing in Islamic affairs and back then associated with the country&#x27;s Interior Ministry, who estimated France&#x27;s total Muslim population to be 6 million out of which 100,000 were converts (up from 50,000 in 1986) while Muslim associations talk of 200,000.

=== Muslim–Jewish relations ===

A survey by the Pew Research Center in 2006 in Germany, France, Great Britain and Spain showed that 71% of French Muslims had a positive view of their fellow Jewish citizens, the highest percentage of positive sentiment, the only majority expressed positively among all the European Muslims polled in Europe and a French exception. A majority of Muslims in France also did not support the Hamas (46% negative vs. 44% positive answers to the question: &quot;Is Hamas&#x27; victory good for Palestinians?&quot;) and 71% of respondents did not approve of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons. This Muslim-Jewish solidarity in France can be partially explained by the fact that a high percentage of both populations share origins in the Maghreb and the effects of French &quot;laïcité&quot; on &quot;vivre-ensemble&quot; (i.e &quot;living-together&quot;) in shared civil institutional spaces remaining religiously and politically neutral for all.

<text>The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), also known as the Rio de Janeiro Conference or the Earth Summit (Portuguese: ECO92, Cúpula da Terra), was a major United Nations conference held in Rio de Janeiro from 3 to 14 June 1992.

The 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (UNCHE) or the Stockholm Conference, was the first global conference to address environmental issues. It took place in Stockholm, Sweden from June 5–16, 1972.

Earth Summit was created as a means for member states to cooperate together internationally on development issues after the Cold War. Due to issues relating to sustainability being too big for individual member states to handle, Earth Summit was held as a platform for other member states to collaborate.

A key achievement of the 1992 conference was the establishment of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) established in part as an international environmental treaty to combat &quot;dangerous human interference with the climate system&quot; and to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. It was signed by 154 states at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED). By 2022, the UNFCCC had 198 parties. Its supreme decision-making body, the Conference of the Parties (COP) meets annually to assess progress in dealing with climate change.

Since the creation of the UNFCC many related environmental conferences, climate-related forums, and ongoing scientific research initiatives in the fields of sustainability, climate, and environmental security have continued to develop these intersecting issues. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and educational institutions have been prominent participants.

The Earth Summit played an influential role in diffusing several key principles of environmental treaties, such as the precautionary principle, common but differentiated responsibilities, and the polluter pays principle.

== Issues addressed ==
The issues addressed include:
* systematic scrutiny of patterns of production—particularly the production of toxic components, such as lead in gasoline, or poisonous waste including radioactive chemicals
* alternative sources of energy to replace the use of fossil fuels which delegates linked to global climate change
* new reliance on public transportation systems in order to reduce vehicle emissions, congestion in cities and the health problems caused by polluted air and smoke
* the growing usage and limited supply of water
* importance of protecting the world&#x27;s oceans.

== Development ==
An important achievement of the summit was an agreement on the Climate Change Convention which in turn led to the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement. Another agreement was to &quot;not to carry out any activities on the lands of indigenous peoples that would cause environmental degradation or that would be culturally inappropriate&quot;.

The Convention on Biological Diversity was opened for signature at the Earth Summit and made a start towards a redefinition of measures that did not inherently encourage the destruction of natural ecoregions and so-called uneconomic growth. World Oceans Day was initially proposed at this conference and has been recognized since then.

Although President George H. W. Bush signed the Earth Summit&#x27;s Convention on Climate, his EPA Administrator William K. Reilly acknowledges that U.S. goals at the conference were difficult to negotiate and the agency&#x27;s international results were mixed, including the U.S. failure to sign the proposed Convention on Biological Diversity.

Twelve cities were also honored with the Local Government Honours Award for innovative local environmental programs. These included Sudbury in Canada for its ambitious program to rehabilitate environmental damage from the local mining industry, Austin in the United States for its green building strategy, and Kitakyūshū in Japan for incorporating an international education and training component into its municipal pollution control program.

The Earth Summit resulted in the following documents:
* Rio Declaration on Environment and Development
* Agenda 21
* Forest Principles

Moreover, important legally binding agreements (Rio Convention) were opened for signature:
* Convention on Biological Diversity
* Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
At Rio it was agreed that an International Negotiating Committee for a third convention the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification would be set up. This convention was negotiated within two years of Rio and then open for signature. It became effective in 1996 after receiving 50 ratifications.

In order to ensure compliance to the agreements at Rio (particularly the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development and Agenda 21), delegates to the Earth Summit established the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD). In 2013, the CSD was replaced by the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development that meets every year as part of the ECOSOC meetings, and every fourth year as part of the General Assembly meetings.

Critics point out that many of the agreements made in Rio have not been realized regarding such fundamental issues as fighting poverty and cleaning up the environment. Malaysia was successful at blocking the US-proposed convention on forests and its prime-minister Mahathir Mohamad accused later the global North of exercising eco-imperialism at this summit. According to Vandana Shiva, Earth Summit create a &quot;moral base for green imperialism&quot;.

Green Cross International was founded to build upon the work of the Summit.

The first edition of Water Quality Assessments, published by WHO/Chapman &amp; Hall, was launched at the Rio Global Forum.

== Youth ==
At this stage, youth were not officially recognised within climate governance. Although youth were not given specific recognition, there was a significant youth turnout at UNCED. Youth were involved in negotiating Chapter 25 of Agenda 21 on Children &amp; Youth in Sustainable Development.

&quot;25.2 It is imperative that youth from all parts of the world participate actively in all relevant levels of decision-making processes because it affects their lives today and has implications for their futures. In addition to their intellectual contribution and their ability to mobilize support, they bring unique perspectives that need to be taken into account.&quot;

Two years prior to UNCED youth organized internationally to prepare for the Earth Summit. Youth concerns were consolidated at a World Youth Environmental Meeting, Juventud (Youth) 92, held in Costa Rica, before the Earth Summit.

&quot;The involvement of today&#x27;s youth in environment and development decision-making...is critical to the long term success of Agenda 21&quot; (UNCED 1992). 

Parallel to UNCED, youth organized the Youth &#x27;92 conference with participation from around the world. Organising took place before, but also afterwards. Many youth participants were dissatisfied with the rate of change.

<doc id="324787" wikidata="Q7337975" url="?curid=324787" title="River Wye, Derbyshire">
<text>The River Wye is a limestone river in the Peak District of Derbyshire, England. It is long, although it is widely quoted as being long, which refers to the section within the National Park. It is one of the major tributaries of the River Derwent, which flows into the River Trent, and ultimately into the Humber and the North Sea.

The river rises just west of Buxton, on Axe Edge Moor, and the flow is augmented by water which passes underground through Poole&#x27;s Cavern before rising at Wye Head. The two sources join as they cross the Pavilion Gardens in Buxton. The river then flows east through the dales of the Wye Valley, along a route roughly followed by the A6 road. It enters the Peak District, flows just south of Tideswell, then through Ashford in the Water and Bakewell, passing to the south of Haddon Hall, before meeting the River Derwent at Rowsley. The main tributary of the river is the River Lathkill, which enters approximately one mile from its mouth.

It is possible to walk alongside much of the length of the river, either following public or permissive footpaths that run along the river bank, or following the former Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midland Junction Railway line, part of which is now the Monsal Trail and provides views of the river. Its final crossing of the river at Monsal Dale is by a viaduct some above the river, which enraged the writer John Ruskin at the time it was built, but is now a listed structure.

The River Wye is one of Derbyshire&#x27;s best-known rivers and is popular with anglers because of the large numbers of wild brown, rainbow trout and grayling it contains. The alkalinity of the Wye provides a rich source of nutrients that leads to an abundance of insects, invertebrates and other wildlife. This ensures that the trout and grayling grow quickly on a diet of freshwater shrimp, caddisfly and mayfly. The river is the only river in Britain known to support a breeding population of rainbow trout, as most varieties do not breed in British waters.

The river has supplied water power to a number of water mills along its length in the past. Those on the upper river were largely used for milling corn, but cotton mills were a feature of buildings further down stream. Some have disappeared without trace, but several of the buildings have been reused for other purposes. Cauldwell Mill survived until recently, being operated by a charitable trust after it ceased commercial production in 1974. It served as a tourist attraction, but it closed in 2023 when the trust became bankrupt.

==Course==
The River Wye rises as four small streams on Axe Edge Moor, to the south-west of Buxton. All four streams are crossed by the A54 road before they join together and continue northwards. The river turns to the north east, and is crossed by a disused railway embankment, before it reaches Burbage, where it is crossed by Macclesfield Old Road and Bishop&#x27;s Lane. A small tributary which flows to the south east joins on its left bank, as the river turns to the east. Another tributary, flowing southwards from a waterfall near Cavendish Golf Club, joins on the left bank just before it enters Pavillion Gardens, a grade II* listed park and gardens. They cover around and during the 17th century were the private gardens of Buxton Hall. The area beside the river was enhanced in the 1830s by Joseph Paxton, for the 6th Duke of Devonshire, and further work took place in the 1870s. The 7th Duke gave it to the Buxton Improvements Company in the 19th century and ownership later passed to Buxton Corporation, who have retained it as a public park. 

Within the park, the main channel is joined by another source of the Wye, which flows through the public show cave of Poole&#x27;s Cavern and emerges on the north side of the B5059 Macclesfield Road at Wye Head. It enters the park and passes through some large ponds before the junction. Where the river reaches the eastern edge of the park, it enters a culvert. Prior to 1780, the river followed a west-to-east route beneath what is now The Crescent. The 5th Duke of Devonshire employed the architect John Carr to carry out building projects to make Buxton more attractive to visitors. In order the build The Crescent, he diverted the river further to the north, through a culvert, and then built the semi-circular building over the river bed. More of the river was culverted in the 1980s, to allow the Spring Gardens Shopping Centre to be built over it. Two small open sections are still visible before it passes under Bridge Street and a railway embankment to emerge into the open air again, close to the Ashwood Dale play area.

Here it is joined by another tributary. Hogshaw Brook rises on Combs Moss, and flows to the south east. Nun Brook rises near Blackedge Farm, and flows to the south. They join together, and then enter a culvert which starts near Lightwood Avenue, and ends to the south of the freight-only railway line to Tunstead Quarry. The stream is crossed by the A6 Fairfield Road just before its junction with the Wye. Below Buxton, the river flows in a steep-sided valley, with the A6 road on its southern bank. The railway to Tunstead Quarry is sandwiched into the same valley, but takes a somewhat straighter course, crossing the river six times. The valley is called first Ashwood Dale, where there is a tributary which joins the right bank of the river, then Wye Dale, where the river is joined by another right-bank tributary which flows northwards through Deep Dale, and then Chee Dale. Here the railway to Tunstead Quarry turns northwards up Great Rocks Dale, while the original continuation of the Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midland Junction Railway to becomes the Monsal Trail, a walking, cycling and horse-riding trail that runs to Bakewell. The A6 road leaves the valley, to follow a more southerly route.

===Middle river===
Within Chee Dale, the river is crossed by a railway bridge carrying the Monsal Trail and another disused railway bridge which formed a chord to the Great Rocks Dale line. The Monsal Trail crosses on another railway bridge, and the river then loops back on itself and forms a large loop to the north. Wormhill Springs adds to the flow of the river, and Chee Dale Nature Reserve is on the left bank. The reserve covers and is managed by the Derbyshire Wildlife Trust. It is notable for its ash woodland, limestone grassland, and the deep gorge through which the river runs. The Monsal Trail avoids the loop, crossing to the south of the river at is start and end, with a tunnel between the two bridges. The second bridge has three arches constructed of blue brick, supported by two pillars of limestone. A stream flowing northwards through Blackwell Dale joins the river on its right bank and the B6049 road crosses as the river enters Millers Dale. There are toilets and car parking available at the former Millers Dale railway station, which provides an access point both to the Monsal Trail, and to the riverside footpath which runs upstream along the left bank to Topley Pike junction, where the trail starts.

The next crossing is the north and south railway viaducts, two parallel bridges that cross the river obliquely. The south viaduct dates from 1862-3, and is grade II* listed. A wrought iron deck is supported by three masonry arches to the west and three spans of wrought iron to the east. Because of the angle of the crossing, the pillars are staggered and are of an irregular hegagonal shape. The deck is around above the river, and carries the Monsal Trail. The north viaduct was added in 1905, as traffic on the railway increased. It is of similar appearance and is supported by four masonry arches to the west with three steel spans to the east. The stream which runs down Monk&#x27;s Dale joins the river on its left bank, and a minor road to Litton Mill shares the valley. At Cressbrook, the stream that flows down Cressbrook Dale joins on the left bank. In Monsal Dale, the Monsal Trail emerges from a tunnel and crosses the river for the final time. The viaduct has five round arches, and is built of limestone rubble with brick detailing. It dates from 1862-3, and has been repaired with gritstone and red bricks. It is around long, and carries the trail above the river. When this structure was built John Ruskin was enraged, and spoke of the Gods being banished by a scheme intended to convey &quot;every Buxton fool to Bakewell in half an hour&quot; and vice versa, &quot;and you call this lucrative exchange—you fools everywhere&quot;.

The river makes a large loop back to the west. Half way round the loop, the A6 road rejoins the valley, and crosses the river twice, before it reaches Ashford-in-the-Water. There are three bridges over the river in Ashford-in-the-Water. Sheepwash bridge has three shallow arches, and may have been built in the 18th century, although there are also suggestions that it may date from the 16th. There was an attached sheep dipping pen on the south east corner of the scheduled monument. Below the bridge, the river splits into multiple channels, associated with a water mill. The A6020 road crosses two channels, while below the mill building, Mill Bridge crosses the northern channel. It has three arches and carries a date stone showing &quot;M Hyde 1664&quot;. The southern channel is crossed by Lees Bridge, with four arches dating from the 18th century, but remodelled in the 19th. The northern channel feeds Ashford Lake, part of the estate of Ashford Hall, which was built in 1785.

===Lower river===
Lumford Mill is situated on the left bank of the river. An early 19th century bridge with three sandstone arches crosses the river near the mill building, while just below the end of the tailrace is Holme Bridge. It is a packhorse bridge dating from 1664, is made of ashlar gritstone, and has five arches. Above the bridge the channel splits, with the southern channel feeding Victoria Mill. Where the tailrace emerges from beneath the mill yard, it is spanned by a single arched bridge with a attached stepped obelisk. Near where the tailrace rejoins the main river, it is spanned by a humpback bridge. Milford Bridge dates from the late 18th century or early 19th. The bridge carrying the A619 road over the river in Bakewell dates from around 1300. It has five pointed arches, with triangular cutwaters, which provide refuges to protect pedestrians from the traffic. It was widened in the 19th century, when the upstream side was built in a style to match the original, and is grade I listed.

A small bridge carries Agricultural way across the river, to provide access to Bakewell Showground. Sheep Bridge provides access to Haddon Park Farm, after which the river enters the grade I listed park and gardens of Haddon Hall. The gardens were laid out in the 17th century, but may have earlier origins, while the parkland dates from the 18th century, again with earlier origins. The main access to the hall is over a three-arched bridge built in 1663. Accounts for the building of the bridge still exist, in the archives of the Duke of Rutland. A little further downstream is Dorothy Vernon&#x27;s bridge, a narrow footbridge with two arches dating from the 17th century. It is so named because Dorothy Vernon is believed to have used it to escape from the festivities of her sister&#x27;s wedding to elope with her lover.As the river leaves Haddon Hall park, it is crossed by Old Fillyford Bridge, a three-arched bridge dating from the 18th century with parapets added in the 19th. It is no longer in use, as it has been replaced by the A6 dual carriageway bridge immediately to the south. The River Lathkill joins on the right bank below the bridge.

As the river approaches Rowsley, the main channel loops to the south, while a secondary channel continues straight on to feed Caudwell&#x27;s Mill. The final bridge crosses the river just as the mill tailrace and main channel recombine. It carries the minor Peaktor Lane over the river. Shortly afterwards, the river empties into the River Derwent, which carries the water southwards to Matlock and Derby.

==Milling==
The river has provided water power to a number of water mills. The furthest upstream was Buxton or Fairfield Mill. The first known mill on the site was built in the 13th century, but was damaged maliciously in the 1490s. There is still a significant drop in the surface level of the river at this point. Subsequently, a medieval mill was erected, probably on the same site. It is shown on maps dating from 1631 and 1791, as well as on the Fairfield Enclosure map of 1772. It is not known when it was demolished. Maps show a small corn mill close to the Ashwood Dale lime works. Dale End sawmill was powered by a breastshot iron waterwheel, in diameter and wide. It was located on the north side of the stone building, but the wheel is now derelict, although the building is in use as a store. It was built some time before 1883, and the weir and water channels are still visibile. Wye Dale water turbine was used to pump water from the river to Pictor Hall and local farms. The small stone building has a date stone showing 1893. Ordnance Survey maps from 1896-1900 labelled the building as a hydraulic pump, but in 1937-1938 they showed it as a steam pump.

At Wormhill there was a flour mill to the south of the former Millers Dale railway station, on the north bank of the river. King John granted a mill at Wormhill to Daniel Puiceman in the late 12th century, but it is not known if the later mill was built on the same site. The present building appears to have been built in three stages, with the oldest dating from 1860 and the newest from the 1920s. All three were modified in the 1970s, and they now house a craft centre. None of the original machinery remains. Tideswell corn mill may be located at the site of a mill mentioned in the Domesday Book in 1086. The present building was built by the Devonshire Estate, and for many decades was worked by members of the Dakin family, who eventually bought the site in the late 18th century. The last miller was George Dakin, who used the mill to make meal for almost 70 years until he died in 1912/13. After standing derelict for many years, the site was bought by Severn Trent Water Authority in 1970. The Arkwright Society carried out a survey of the building, and the machinery was removed, to be re-erected at Cromford Corn Mill, before the main structure was demolished in 1973, to make way for a borehole. The waterwheel was manufactured in Sheffield by Thomas Cavil in the 1860s. It was a low breast-shot wheel, with an iron frame, and was in diameter by wide. It was retained in situ, and was refurbished by Severn Trent in 1997, although the mill race remains dry.
Litton Mill, at Slack Side, Litton was built on the site of an earlier mill, as Senior&#x27;s map of 1611 shows a corn mill there. However, around 1782 it was replaced by a water-powered cotton spinning mill built by Ellis Needham and his partners. This lasted until 1870, when a fire destroyed most of it, although some of the 1780s buildings remain. The mill was rebuilt in 1874, and continued to operate until 1997. The site retains an undershot water wheel, of unknown date, which was fed directly from the river, without the benefit of a mill pond. There is also a chimney and flue, located higher up on the side of the dale, which is the only one of its type in good condition in the Peak District. Gas to light the mill and the nearby village was produced in a gas house, constructed between 1820 and 1840. By 2002, this was in a very dilapidated state, but has subsequently been repaired and altered. The mill building has been converted into flats. A litle further downstream are the remains of a water-powered pump. It was used to pump spring water to a reservoir, was powered by a water wheel which was in diameter by wide, and was associated with Lees Rake and Burfoot Mines.

===Below Cressbrook===
Richard Arkwright built a cotton mill at Cressbrook in 1779, which only lasted until 1785, when it burnt down. His son, also called RIchard, bought the site in 1787, and started rebuilding the mill soon afterwards. This in turn was replaced by a new mill building between 1814 and 1816, constructed by William Newton with 12 bays and four storeys. To celebrate the coronation of Queen Victoria, the building was embellished with a clock and cupola in 1837. Many of the workforce were poor apprentices, who were better treated than those at nearby Litton Mill. They were housed in an Apprentice house, built in 1795. Cotton production ceased in 1967, after which the building was used by a stone-cutting business. When first built, the mill was powered by water from Cress Brook, as the Duke of Devonshire owned the water rights on the Wye.

The next mill site downstream is known as Ashford Bobbin Mill, although there is no known documentary evidence to support a local tradition that its early use was to produce bobbins for the nearby cotton industry. It appears to have been used as a bone mill, and then as a saw mill. Three water wheels survive, two to power the mills, and a third smaller one to pump spring water up to the village of Sheldon. In 1979, the Arkwright Society restored the buildings. The Black Marble Mill at Ashford-in-the-Water had a long history, as Thomas Accres constructed &quot;an engyne for the sawing of blackstone&quot; in 1595. Henry Watson built a new marble works on the site in 1748, and in 1751 patented a machine for cutting and polishing marble. A leat supplied three mill races, each with their own building and water wheel. The business was not a commercial success, until work on Chatsworth House started in the 1820s, when the mill supplied marble doorways and other marble fittings for the project. Two of the water wheels were replaced by water turbines in 1884 and 1885, although the third wheel was retained, as the building it powered had been rented out for the manufacture of combs. Production of marble products ceased in 1905, and little remains of the buildings, although the leats and turbines are still visible.

A second marble mill was built by George Redfern of Ashford-in-the-Water around 1846. It was known as Batch Mill or the Derbyshire Marble Works. A new weir was constructed in the river, at right angles to an existing weir which fed water to Ashford Corn Mill. A covered leat delivered water to the mill, which was housed in old farm buildings behind Great Batch Hall. The water wheel was replaced by a turbine around 1860, and production ceased before 1890. Ashford Corn Mill is a &quot;L&quot;-shaped building, dating from the 18th century, with additions made in the 19th and 20th centuries. It is also known as Flewitt&#x27;s Corn Mill, and the complex includes a drying kiln. It was originally powered by two undershot water wheels, one made of iron and the other of wood. These were removed around 1900, and replaced by a single turbine, manufactured by Gilkes of Kendal. This drove three sets of stones, of which two remain, as they were replaced by rollers. The mill continued operating commercially until the 1970s, making it one of the last in the country to use water power. It is in good condition, with most of the machinery and the kiln still intact. A two-year project to refurbish the building was competed in 2017, and won the Peak District National Park Planning Award for Conservation in 2018. The mill has featured on Channel 4 TV&#x27;s Remarkable Renovations programme, and on the BBC&#x27;s Countryfile. The building is rented out as holiday accommodation. As part of the renovation, the water turbine was refurbished, enabling the mill to be self-sufficient for electrical power.

===Lower river===

Richard Arkwright rented land for Lumford Mill from Philip Gell in 1777. There were some difficulties with water rights, but once these were resolved, he constructed a four-storey cotton mill powered by a single water wheel, fed by a leat from the river. This may not have been adequate, as Arkwright built a reservoir, and then two more reservoirs to ensure a good water supply. Arkwright and his son made at least three alterations to the course of the river, which resulted in legal disputes with the Duke of Rutland. The water wheel was replaced by a larger one in 1827, and in 1840 a larger mill race was built, allowing the reservoirs to be filled in. A second water wheel was added in 1852. Water power was probably supplemented by steam power, as a gas plant was built on the site in 1844. Much of the mill burnt down in 1868, and a new mill was constructed on a slightly smaller scale. Cotton production ceased in 1896, and the site was bought by DP Batteries in 1898. The water wheels failed in 1955, and were replaced by a water turbine manufactured by Gilbert Gilkes &amp; Gordon. The site was sold to W Fernehough Ltd in 1970.

The mill leat for Victoria Mill starts where the tailrace from Lumford Mill ends. A mill was mentioned in the Domesday Book, and it is probable that the same site was used for the more recent mill. The building was constructed around 1800 and was used for milling corn. The leat fed a breast-shot water wheel which was in diameter and wide. It continued to be used for grinding corn and animal feed until after 1945, although the precise date at which production stopped is not known. The building has iron-framed windows and a lucam for raising sacks of grain to the upper floors. The water wheel dated from aroudn 1850, and was removed from its pit in 1971 to be restored, but this did not happen, and it has rusted away. Several of the windows next to the road had been filled in, but during restoration in 1970 were reglazed using iron framed windows removed from the rear of the building. The sluice and water wheel are separately listed. The sluice dates from the early 19th century, but may have been altered when a new wheel was fitted in 1850. It is constructed of dressed gritstone, and has iron machinery.

Rutland Works was another site where marble was processed, It was close to Bakewell Bridge, and when built in 1847, consisted of two stone buildings, with a water wheel between them. There was a timber yard behind the Manners Hotel, but this was severely damaged in the 1880s, after which the marble mill was extended, to include a saw mill. A water driven turbine was installed at a similar time. The works processed black marble, a type of carboniferous limestone which can be polished to produce an attractive black or grey stone. The stone-cutting machines remained in place until 1996. The final mill on the river is Caudwell&#x27;s Mill at Rowsley. Records confirm that there was a mill at Rowsley in 1339, and in the 1500s there were two mills, one a corn mill and the other a fulling mill. A saw mill replaced the fulling mill between 1799 and 1840, but was abandoned around 1871. The corn mill ceased operating in 1858. Both were demolished and a new corn mill was constructed by John Caudwell in 1874. Four breast-shot water wheels provided the power to eight pairs of stones. However, roller milling arrived in Britain in 1877, and the mill was updated in 1881, when rollers replaced the mill stones. A turbine replaced the water wheels in 1887. Inprovements continued to be made in the early 20th century. An American Little Giant turbine was installed in 1898, new rollers were fitted in 1905, most of the machinery was updated in 1914, and a Francis twin turbine was installed at the same time. Two purifiers were added in 1932. The building is grade II* listed. The mill ceased to be used commercially in 1974, but was taken over by a charitable trust. An electric motor was fitted to power the machinery, but all the other original equipment was retained. The mill closed in 2023, when the trust went into voluntary liquidation.

==Ecology==
Water in the river benefits from being filtered by the surrounding limestone, and is consequently very clear. It is also alkaline, with a good variety of nutrients, providing ideal conditions for invertebrates and insects to flourish. These include Blue-winged Olive flies, caddisfly, gammarus and mayfly. THe Haddon Estate, which manages much of the river, does not allow any pesticides to be used near the river corridor, and has a policy of using buffer strips to reduce erosion that can be caused by grazing animals.

Rainbow trout were imported into Britain in the 1890s from the Pacific coast of America. Some were hatched and kept in Ashford Lake at Ashford-in-the-Water, but some five years after their introduction a flood breached the dam impounding the lake, and the trout escaped into the river. The environment of the Wye suited them, and they became a self-sustaining spawning population. Later imports of rainbow trout were of the Shasta variety. and these do not spawn in British rivers. The Wye is the only known river in England with a population of wild rainbow trout, and is of interest to ecologists and dry-fly fishermen. Unlike American rainbow trout, which spawn in the winter, the fish in the Wye spawn in the spring. The proliferation of invertebrates in the river results in them growing fast, with mortality being very low.

Prior to 2003, some re-stocking of the river was carried out, but this has not been the case for over twenty years, and so the fish are truly wild. The Wye is also notable for populations of native brown trout and grayling. The fish provide food for other species, including otter, kingfisher, osprey and dipper. Recovery of the water vole population is aided by wetland areas with beds of iris and sedge, while marginal plants growing along the river banks include broad-leaved willowherb, common reedmace, greater pond sedge, marsh thistle, meadowsweet, meadow vetchling, water figwort, water forget-me-not and water mint. Common species of trees that grow beside the river include willow, alder, poplar, oak and ash.

==Access==
From Buxton to Deep Dale, the A6 road runs alongside the river, but the road has no footpaths, and so cannot be easily viewed. However, at Deep Dale there is a car park from which a public footpath runs along the right bank of the river. At Topley Pike junction, walkers can ascend onto the railway formation at the start of the Monsal Trail, or can cross the river and follow the footpath on the left bank. The footpath passes through a ravine where overhanging cliffs abut the river. In good conditions, walkers can continue along the Chee Dale stepping stones, which are made of limestone blocks placed in the river in ancient times, but when the river is high, they become too dangerous to use, and visitors can only use the Monsal Trail. The footpath continues along the river to Millers Dale, ending near the former railway station where there is another car park. The minor road to Litton Mill then runs along the left bank, and is quite close to the river. Beyond Litton Mill, a permissive footpath follows the left bank to Cressbrook, where it crosses to the right bank and rises to reach the Monsal Trail.

From Cressbrook to Monsal Head, a minor road runs along the floor of the valley, which is wider than it was through Millers Dale. From Monsal Head, where the Monsal Trail leaves the river, a public footpath follows the right bank of the river to Lees Bottom, where it ends at the A6 road. The road then follows the river, and there is another section of public footpath on the right bank as it appraches Ashford-in-the-Water. Below the village, a short section of path follows the right bank opposite Ashford Lake. Below Bakewell, public footpaths follow the left bank as far as Haddon Hall, beyond which the river can only be seen at a distance from the A6 road or from bridges.

Some of the river is also accessible by canoe or kayak. There is a suitable launching point at the Deep Dale car park, and the river can be paddled either to Millers Dale station or to Litton Mill. There is a sloping weir to negotiate within of the start point. The journey from Deep Dale to Litton Mill is about and is rated as grade 2 or 3 for difficulty.

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency assesses the water quality within the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

The water quality of the River Wye was as follows in 2019/2022.

While the ecological status of the upper river was good, the lower river was moderate, due to the presence of high levels of zinc in the water. Like most rivers in the UK, the chemical status changed from good to fail in 2019, due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), which had not previously been included in the assessment.

<text>The River Noe is a tributary of the River Derwent in Derbyshire, England. It flows approximately 12 miles (19 km) from its source, the confluence of two streams running off Kinder Scout in the Peak District, east through Edale and then southeast through the village of Hope.

The river&#x27;s source is at Edale Head from where it runs down the clough alongside Jacob&#x27;s Ladder footpath and through the Vale of Edale. The river flows into the River Derwent a kilometre south of Bamford. The entire length of the river is closely followed by the Hope Valley (Manchester to Sheffield) railway line.

The portion of the river downstream of Hope, along with the valley of the River Noe&#x27;s main tributary, Peakshole Water, is known as the Hope Valley.
Like many rivers in Derbyshire, the Noe was used historically to power water mills, originally these were mainly corn mills but during the industrial revolution some were rebuilt for other uses.

One example of this was the cotton mill at Edale; built in the late 18th century it shares a common design with other mills of the period, including multiple floors with large windows and a shallow pitched roof. There was also a corn and saw mill at Hope, driven by an 11 ft water wheel.

At Brough there were a number of mills that used the Noe, including a lace-thread doubling mill, a cotton mill and the corn mill (pictured). The corn mill is notable in that water-powered milling came to an end in 1954, when the flow of the Noe was reduced by the upstream diversion scheme. This was constructed to provide additional inflows for Ladybower Reservoir by the Derwent Valley Water Board.

The Romans established Navio fort overlooking a tight bend on the River Noe at Brough, which means fort in Old English.

<text>The River Ashop is a river in the Derbyshire Peak District, England. Its source is on the eastern slopes of Mill Hill, three miles south east of Glossop and just north of Kinder Scout.

The river flows approximately ten kilometres east, following the Sheffield to Manchester Snake Pass road through remote countryside, before emptying into Ladybower Reservoir, which itself flows into the River Derwent.

The only significant tributary of the River Ashop is the short River Alport. The flow of the Alport is partially diverted by a weir to feed into the Ashop above the impound weir built in the 1920s to increase the catchment area of the Derwent Reservoir prior to the building of the Ladybower Reservoir downstream. The weir impounded the water and fed it into an open culvert (water conduit) that was built along the side of the hill. The culvert then feeds into a siphon over the river in a iron pipe before entering a tunnel to pass through the hill to the Derwent Reservoir via an open watercourse, entering the reservoir just north of the dam wall. The concrete structure of the weir is visible when travelling up the Snake Pass route from Sheffield.

==Recreational use==
The river is occasionally used for recreational purposes, such as kayaking. This is usually limited to periods after heavy rainfall when the river is in spate, because in times of normal flows the river is too shallow to use. When the river is in spate it becomes very technical, with many weirs and holes. The river is quite narrow and relatively shallow, making the rocky bed hazardous for kayakers who capsize. By far the most challenging part is in the higher-volume upper section of the river, where a small tributary of the Ashop flows swiftly through a steep tunnel under the road. The river has many obstacles such as fallen trees, and fences which lie across the channel and must be negotiated. This makes it dangerous at times of high water if the river is flowing rapidly.

<doc id="324795" wikidata="Q215134" url="?curid=324795" title="John Dunstaple">
<text>John Dunstaple (or Dunstable; – 24 December 1453) was an English composer whose music helped inaugurate the transition from the medieval to the Renaissance periods. The central proponent of the &quot;Contenance angloise&quot; style (), Dunstaple was the leading English composer of his time, and is often coupled with William Byrd and Henry Purcell as England&#x27;s most important early music composers. His style would have an immense influence on the subsequent music of continental Europe, inspiring composers such as Du Fay, Binchois, Ockeghem and Busnois.

Information on Dunstaple&#x27;s life is largely non-existent or speculative, with the only certain date of his activity being his death on Christmas Eve of 1453. Probably born in Dunstable in Bedfordshire during the late 14th-century, Dunstaple was associated with Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester and Joan of Navarre, and, through them, St Albans Abbey. Another important patron was John, Duke of Bedford, with whom Dunstaple may have travelled to France.

Dunstaple&#x27;s surviving music is exclusively vocal, and frequently uses isorhythms, while pioneering the prominent use of harmonies with thirds and sixths.

==Life and career==
Nothing is known for certain of John Dunstaple&#x27;s background or early life. This uncertainty, and the general vagueness surrounding most details of his life, has led to much speculation and sometimes fictionalized information concerning his life and career. Some of the spurious information comes from misreadings of Johannes Tinctoris&#x27;s writings, leading to the erroneous identification of the composer with the 10th-century saint Dunstan. Dunstaple&#x27;s birthdate is a conjecture based on his earliest surviving works from around 1410–1420, which suggests he was born in the late 14th century; the musicologist Margaret Bent records .

His birthplace is unknown, though it is assumed that his family adopted their surname after the town of Dunstable, Bedfordshire. Modern scholarship has sometimes used the spelling &#x27;Dunstable&#x27; to match the town&#x27;s name, though sources of the composer&#x27;s time generally refer to him as &#x27;Dunstaple&#x27; instead. The musicologist Margaret Bent notes that the &#x27;p&#x27; spelling is more than twice as common as the &#x27;b&#x27; variant in musical sources, and while the few extant English sources use the &#x27;b&#x27; and &#x27;p&#x27; variants with equal frequency, contemporary non-musical sources almost exclusively follow the &#x27;p&#x27; spelling. Less common spellings include &#x27;Dunstapell&#x27;, &#x27;Dumstable&#x27; and &#x27;Donstaple&#x27;, among others; one source simply inscribed &#x27;J. D.&#x27;. Records from the early 15th century include many references to people named (or with a similar name to) &#x27;John Dunstaple&#x27;, making it difficult to identify the composer. The more plausible candidates include a canon of Hereford Cathedral (1419–1440) named &#x27;John Dunstavylle&#x27;, though there is no convincing evidence for this. However, the composer is usually identified as the &#x27;John Dunstaple&#x27; that owned a series of astronomy treatises and was described as a &#x27;musician with the Duke of Bedford&#x27;.

He is widely held to have been in the royal service of John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford, the fourth son of Henry IV and brother of Henry V. As such he may have stayed in France for some time, since the duke was Regent of France from 1423 to 1429, and then Governor of Normandy from 1429 to his death in 1435. He owned property in Normandy, and also in Cambridgeshire, Essex and London, according to tax records of 1436. After the death in 1437 of another patron, the Dowager Queen Joan, he evidently was in the service of Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, the fifth son of Henry IV.

Unlike many composers of the time, he was probably not a cleric or monk, though there are links with St Albans Abbey (see below); he was probably married, based on the record of women sharing his name in his parish, and he also owned a manor in Hertfordshire.

Dunstaple&#x27;s connections with St Albans Abbey are at least twofold:
*the abbot John Whethamstede is associated with the Duke of Gloucester (who was buried at St Albans following his death in 1447), and Dunstaple&#x27;s isorhythmic motet &quot;Albanus roseo rutilat&quot;, possibly with some of the Latin words adapted by Whethamstede from an older poem, was clearly written for St Albans, possibly for a visit to the abbey by the Duke of Bedford in 1426.
*Whethamstede&#x27;s plan for a magnificent library for the abbey in 1452–53 included a set of twelve stained glass windows devoted to the various branches of learning. Dunstaple is clearly, if indirectly, referred to in some of the verses the abbot composed for each window, not only music but also astronomy, medicine, and astrology.

Epitaphs written upon Dunstaple&#x27;s death identify him as not only a musician, but as well as respected mathematician, astronomer and astrologer. Dunstaple is referenced in at least three non-musical manuscripts. Of these, Bent considers &quot;GB-Ce 70&quot; (Emmanuel College, Cambridge) the most important and it includes astrological works with accompanying drawings which may be his own. Another, &quot;GB-Ob&quot; Laud misc. 674 (Bodleian Library, Oxford), demonstrates &quot;high competence but no more originality than any of his contemporaries&quot; according to Bent. Although no extant mathematic or scientific manuscripts written by him survive, he is known to have made copies of other&#x27;s manuscripts. Dunstaple also owned two manuscripts by Boethius: a copy of &quot;De musica&quot; and &quot;De arithmetica&quot;.

Dunstaple died on Christmas Eve 1453, as recorded in his epitaph in London&#x27;s church of St Stephen Walbrook, where he was buried.

==Music==

The musical output of medieval England was prodigious, yet almost all music manuscripts were destroyed during the English Reformation, particularly as a result of the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536–1540. As a result, most of Dunstaple&#x27;s work has had to be recovered from continental sources (predominantly those from northern Italy and the southern Alps).

Because numerous copies of his works have been found in Italian and German manuscripts, his fame must have been widespread. Two problems face musicologists of the 15th century: first, determining which of the many surviving anonymous works were written by which composers and, second, unraveling conflicting attributions. This is made even more difficult for English composers such as Dunstaple: scribes in England frequently copied music without any ascription, rendering it immediately anonymous; and, while continental scribes were more assiduous in this regard, many works published in Dunstaple&#x27;s name have other, potentially equally valid, attributions in different sources to other composers, including Gilles Binchois, John Forest and, Leonel Power.

Of the works attributed to him only about fifty survive, among which are two complete masses, three sets of connected mass sections, fourteen individual mass sections, twelve complete isorhythmic motets (including the famous one which combines the hymn &quot;Veni creator spiritus&quot; and the sequence &quot;Veni sancte spiritus&quot;, and the less well-known &quot;Albanus roseo rutilat&quot; mentioned above), as well as twenty-seven separate settings of various liturgical texts, including three &quot;Magnificats&quot; and seven settings of Marian antiphons, such as &quot;Alma redemptoris Mater&quot; and &quot;Salve Regina, Mater misericordiae&quot;. Dunstaple was one of the first to compose masses using a single melody as &quot;cantus firmus.&quot; A good example of this technique is his &quot;Missa Rex seculorum&quot;.

He is believed to have written secular music, but no songs in the vernacular can be attributed to him with any degree of certainty: although the French-texted &quot;rondeau&quot; &quot;Puisque m’amour&quot; is attributed to Dunstaple in two sources and there is no reason to doubt his authorship, the &quot;ballade&quot; remained the more favoured form for English secular song at this time and there is limited opportunity for comparison with the rest of his output. The popular melody &quot;O rosa bella&quot;, once thought to be by Dunstaple, is now attributed to John Bedingham (or Bedyngham). Yet, because so much of the surviving 15th-century repertory of English carols is anonymous, and Dunstaple is known to have written many, most scholars consider it highly likely—for stylistic as well as statistical reasons—that some of the anonymous carols from this time are actually by Dunstaple.

==Influence==
Dunstaple&#x27;s influence on the continent&#x27;s musical vocabulary was enormous, particularly considering the relative paucity of his (attributable) works. He was recognized for possessing something never heard before in music of the Burgundian School: &quot;la contenance angloise&quot; (&quot;the English countenance&quot;), a term used by the poet Martin le Franc in his &quot;Le Champion des Dames.&quot; Le Franc added that the style influenced Dufay and Binchois—high praise indeed.

Writing a few decades later in about 1476, the Flemish composer and music theorist Tinctoris reaffirmed the powerful influence Dunstaple had, stressing the &quot;new art&quot; that Dunstaple had inspired. Tinctoris hailed Dunstaple as the &quot;fons et origo&quot; of the style, its &quot;wellspring and origin.&quot;

The &quot;contenance angloise,&quot; while not defined by Martin le Franc, was probably a reference to Dunstaple&#x27;s stylistic trait of using full triadic harmony, along with a liking for the interval of the third. Assuming that he had been on the continent with the Duke of Bedford, Dunstaple would have been introduced to French &quot;fauxbourdon&quot;; borrowing some of the sonorities, he created elegant harmonies in his own music using thirds and sixths. Taken together, these are seen as defining characteristics of early Renaissance music, and both Le Franc&#x27;s and Tinctoris&#x27;s comments suggest that many of these traits may have originated in England, taking root in the Burgundian School around the middle of the century.

<doc id="324797" wikidata="Q796625" url="?curid=324797" title="Edale">
<text>Edale is a village and civil parish in the Peak District, Derbyshire, England, whose population was 353 at the 2011 Census. Edale, with an
area of ,
is in the Borough of High Peak.

Edale is best known to walkers as the start, or southern end, of the Pennine Way and, to less ambitious walkers, as a starting point for evening or day walks. The village is accessible by generally hourly railway services from Sheffield and Manchester. There are two pubs serving real ale and food.

==History==
As spelt, the name is first recorded in 1732. Earlier recorded versions of the name are &quot;Aidele&quot; (1086), &quot;Heydale&quot; (1251), &quot;Eydale&quot; (1275), &quot;Eydal&quot; (1285) and &quot;Edall&quot; (1550).

Historically, Edale was the name of the valley of the River Noe. From the Norman Conquest of England it was in the royal Forest of High Peak and at its centre is the Edale Cross, which marked the boundary of the three wards at the Forest, Campana, Hopedale and Longdendale. Settlement in the valley consists of several &quot;booths&quot;, originally established in the 13th century as &#x27;vaccaries&#x27; (cattle farms) along the valley of the River Noe, which have since developed into the hamlets of Upper Booth (once Crowdenley Booth and Over Booth), Barber Booth (once Whitmorely Booth), Grindsbrook Booth, Ollerbrook Booth and Nether Booth (also known as Lady Booth and, formerly, Lower Booth).

===Cotton mill===
Edale is the site of a historic cotton mill built in 1795 on the site of a corn mill and tannery by Nicholas Cresswell in partnership with James Harrison, Robert Blackwell and Joseph Fletcher. Workers were brought in from the towns and accommodated in cottages and in a nearby house called Skinner&#x27;s Hall. Many of the women workers walked each day from Castleton over the thousand-foot Hollins Cross pass. The mill continued spinning cotton until around 1940 but then fell into disuse. It was restored in the early 1970s by the Landmark Trust who have since sold off all of the apartments.

==Countryside==
As well as being the start of the Pennine Way (the official start is the Old Nag&#x27;s Head, a former smithy dating back to 1577), the village is surrounded by walking country which is excellent in its own right. The village lies in the Vale of Edale and is surrounded by hills: the plateau of Kinder Scout to the north, where the highest point in the parish is found, the Great Ridge (running west to east between Rushup Edge over Mam Tor to Lose Hill) to the south and east, Win Hill to the east (outside the parish), and Dalehead (Brown Knoll, Horsehill Tor and Colborne) to the west. Almost the entire parish is over 200m above sea level; only along the River Noe east from Carr House does the elevation drop below this level.

The bed and banks of the River Noe from Barber Booth upstream to approximately the contour constitute the Edale SSSI, cited for geological interest. The &quot;important exposures&quot; of the Edale Shales here contain fossils of technical interest.

==Amenities==
There is a youth hostel about a mile from the village centre, several B&amp;Bs and both pubs also provide accommodation. The pubs also provide food and there are two cafés. 

In 2006, a new information and visitor centre was opened at Fieldhead; it was developed by the Moors for the Future partnership and is owned and operated by the Peak District National Park Authority. 

Edale is also a popular camping village, with two major campsites and numerous others in the surrounding area.

==Media==
Regional TV news comes from Leeds-based BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire. Television signals are received from the local relay transmitter. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Derby and Greatest Hits Radio Derbyshire (High Peak) (formerly High Peak Radio).

The village is served by the local newspapers the &quot;Peak Advertiser&quot; and the &quot;Buxton Advertiser&quot;.

==Transport==
Edale railway station lies on the trans-Pennine Hope Valley line and receives a reasonably frequent service for such a rural area. The typical off-peak is one train an hour in both directions, with some gaps at certain times of the day, to Sheffield and to Manchester Piccadilly via Marple. Services are operated by Northern Trains.

The short but narrow, twisting and dead-end road to the village centre is not suitable for visitors&#x27; cars and parking in the village centre is almost impossible. However, there is a large pay-and-display car park near the village hall and parking for rail users at the railway station. Additional parking near the station is provided at busy times by the Parish Council.

<text>In the area of modern algebra known as group theory, the baby monster group &quot;B&quot; (or, more simply, the baby monster) is a sporadic simple group of order

:   4,154,781,481,226,426,191,177,580,544,000,000
: = 241313567211131719233147
: ≈ 4.

&quot;B&quot; is one of the 26 sporadic groups and has the second highest order of these, with the highest order being that of the monster group. The double cover of the baby monster is the centralizer of an element of order 2 in the monster group. The outer automorphism group of &quot;B&quot; is trivial and the Schur multiplier of &quot;B&quot; has order 2.

==History==
The existence of this group was suggested by Bernd Fischer in unpublished work from the early 1970s during his investigation of {3,4}-transposition groups: groups generated by a class of transpositions such that the product of any two elements has order at most 4. He investigated its properties and computed its character table. The first construction of the baby monster was later realized as a permutation group on 13,571,955,000 points using a computer by Jeffrey Leon and Charles Sims. Robert Griess later found a computer-free construction using the fact that its double cover is contained in the monster group. The name &quot;baby monster&quot; was suggested by John Horton Conway.

==Representations==
In characteristic 0, the 4371-dimensional representation of the baby monster does not have a nontrivial invariant algebra structure analogous to the Griess algebra, but showed that it does have such an invariant algebra structure if it is reduced modulo 2.

The smallest faithful matrix representation of the Baby Monster is of size 4370 over the finite field of order 2.

 constructed a vertex operator algebra acted on by the baby monster.

==Generalized monstrous moonshine==
Conway and Norton suggested in their 1979 paper that monstrous moonshine is not limited to the monster, but that similar phenomena may be found for other groups. Larissa Queen and others subsequently found that one can construct the expansions of many Hauptmoduln from simple combinations of dimensions of sporadic groups. For the Baby monster &quot;B&quot; or &quot;F&quot;2, the relevant McKay–Thompson series is formula_1 where one can set the constant term .

:formula_2

and &quot;η&quot;(&quot;τ&quot;) is the Dedekind eta function.

==Maximal subgroups==
 found the 30 conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups of &quot;B&quot; which are listed in the table below.

<text>The River Dearne South Yorkshire, England flows roughly east for more than , from its source just inside West Yorkshire. It flows through Denby Dale, Clayton West, Darton, Barnsley, Darfield, Wath upon Dearne, Bolton on Dearne, Adwick upon Dearne and Mexborough to its confluence with the River Don at Denaby Main. Its main tributary is the River Dove, which joins it at Darfield. The river was one of those affected by the 2007 United Kingdom floods.

The course of the river is accessible to walkers as the Dearne Way, a long distance footpath from &quot;Dearne Head&quot; to the river&#x27;s junction with the Don. Places of interest along the Dearne include the Yorkshire Sculpture Park at West Bretton, and Monk Bretton Priory. The Dearne Valley below Barnsley is a regeneration area.

The river has been subject to channel engineering to ease the problem of flooding. A new channel was constructed near its mouth in the 1950s, as the old route had been affected by mining subsidence. Washlands, which can be progressively flooded as water levels rise, were constructed in the 1960s and 1970s. A flood relief channel and a regulator to restrict the flow was built at Bolton upon Dearne. During the 2007 United Kingdom floods, the washlands filled to capacity but the regulator could not be operated as it had been vandalised.

Industrialisation caused the river and the Dearne and Dove Canal, to become grossly polluted in the early nineteenth century and fish populations died. The West Riding River Board tried to address the problems in 1896 with limited success and much of the river remained dead until the 1980s, when industrial effluents were removed before they were discharged and improvements were made to sewage treatment. Despite setbacks, fish populations had been partially reinstated by the early 1990s. Channel engineering was carried out at Denaby in the 1990s, to re-introduce bends, deep pools and shallow gravel riffles, to assist fish spawning. In June 2015, salmon were reported in the river for the first time in 150 years.

==Route==
The river rises just below the contour west of Birdsedge. Within around , it reaches the A635 Barnsley Road bridge at Denby Dale, by which time it has dropped below the contour, and its flow has been swelled by several springs and the output of Park Dike. Below the bridge, Munchcliffe Beck joins near a large millpond, which supplied mills at Denby Dale. Beyond the mills, the river passes under a railway viaduct near Denby Dale railway station. The curved viaduct with 21 tall arches was built by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway in 1884.

The river flows to the north east closely following the A636 road. It is joined by Thorpe Dike at Kitchenroyd. It passes through Scissett and west of Clayton West where it is crossed by the Kirklees Light Railway. Park Gate Dike swells the flow, before a double-arched skew bridge built in the early 19th century carries the A636 over the channel. Nearby is a hump-backed packhorse bridge with a single arch, probably built in the previous century, after which the river turns to the east to pass the upper and lower lakes in a channel from where it feed the lakes in the Yorkshire Sculpture Park. Bretton Hall lies to the north. The river turns south at the dam of the lower lake and passes over weirs before picking up the outflow from the lakes, after which the contour is crossed.

Next it turns to the south east and passes under the A637 road, the M1 motorway and the sliproads which form part of Junction 38, to reach Darton. The Cawthorne Dike joins from the west as it turns to the east and passes under the Wakefield to Barnsley railway line. The B6428 crosses on Barugh Bridge, a single-span bridge made of rock-faced stone, which bears the date 1850 on the north-west buttress. As the river approaches Barnsley, the remains of the Barnsley Canal follow it on the south bank. Beyond the A61 Old Mill Lane bridge there was a mill, after which an aqueduct carried the canal over the river. Two more road bridges follow, the second of which carries the A633 Grange Lane. Just before the bridge is Priory Mill, a thirteenth-century mill which was heavily rebuilt by Sir William Armyne in 1635, and further remodelled in the nineteenth century. It was powered by a leat from the river, which supplied internal water wheels. Water from the leat was also channelled to Monk Bretton Priory, where it flushed the kitchens and the reredorter. Next there are two former railway bridges which now carry footpaths. Soon sections of the disused Dearne and Dove Canal run parallel to the river, and after passing under two more railway bridges, the course turns to the south to reach Darfield, below which the River Dove joins from the west. The river turns to the east again, passing to the north east of a series of lakes which form the Dearne Ings and Old Moor washlands. On the opposite side of the channel are the Bolton Ings washlands, which cover and have been acquired by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). In 2011, the site was in its early stages of development, but the reedbeds have attracted spoonbills and avocets, and are expected to act as a breeding ground for bitterns in due course. After the washlands, the river flows to the north of Wath upon Dearne, and to the south of Bolton on Dearne.

The railway to Bolton on Dearne station crosses, after which the river is flanked by the disused Bolton Common tip on the south bank. From the village of Adwick upon Dearne, which is a little further to the south, Harlington Road crosses the river at Adwick Bridge, a grade II listed twin-arched bridge built of sandstone around 1800. Denaby Ings nature reserve is separated from the river by a railway embankment on the north bank. The river sweeps round to the south to join the River Don just below Mexborough Low Lock, where Mexborough New Cut on the River Don Navigation rejoins the river. In 1903 the junction of the river with the Don was adjacent to the railway sidings of the Cadeby Main colliery, but by 1930 it had been moved further upstream, much closer to its present location.

There is a long-distance path which follows the course of the river from its source to its junction with the River Don. It is known as the Dearne Way, and the paths are marked on current editions of the Ordnance Survey maps. The path is around long and can be walked in 12 to 16 hours. Walkers who start at the source descend through over the length of the walk.

==Flood defences==

By the 1950s, the course of the river near its mouth had been affected by subsidence from coal mining, and the lowering of the channel resulted in much of the surrounding land being regularly flooded. In order to alleviate the problem and restore the gradient of the channel at this point, a new channel was constructed on the south side of the railway embankment, from near Harlington to the River Don. The old channel can still be seen on the north side of the embankment, and connects to the Denaby Ings Nature Reserve.

As part of a comprehensive assessment of flood risks caused by the River Don and its tributaries, the River Dearne Improvement Scheme was implemented between 1963 and 1973. It was recognised that simple enlargement of the river channel would not provide a satisfactory solution, as it would just move the problem to the River Don, and therefore a series of washlands were created, which could be progressively flooded if required, without affecting centres of population. Near the mouth of the river, Dearne Mouth washland, which is now known as the Denaby Ings Nature Reserve, was created in 1963, and a manually operated sluice allowed the flow of the river to be diverted through the floodbank and into the washland when there were high levels at the junction with the River Don. The sluice was rebuilt in 1973. Additional washlands were created at Harlington and North Ings, and the river was straightened and realigned.

Further upriver, a flood relief channel was built at Bolton upon Dearne, and more washlands were formed between Wath railway bridge and Adwick bridge. The Bolton Ings and Old Moor washlands were next to be created, to be followed by those at Wombwell Ings, where the River Dove joins the Dearne, Darfield, Houghton and Cudworth. Some of the storage capacity was lost as a result of mining schemes, and a regulator was installed at Bolton in 1972, allowing the flow to be restricted by a sluice gate. During the flooding in 2007, all of the washlands filled to capacity, although the Bolton regulator could not be operated as it had been vandalised. Some damage to the Houghton washlands resulted from the extremely high water levels, which overtopped the banks and caused erosion to take place. Following the floods, a reassessment of the function of the regulators was carried out, and in view of the costs of maintaining them, the Environment Agency intend to remove them once some reconfiguration of the river channel has been completed. This work will ensure that the washlands fill and empty at the appropriate points in a flood cycle.

==Water quality==
In the late 1700s, the river held good populations of fish. Industrial development of the valley consisted of several deep coal mines, but they were fairly small, and did not significantly pollute the river. There were collieries at Smithies, Honeywell, Queens Ground and Mount Osborne. The opening of the Dearne and Dove Canal in 1810 had serious impacts on the river, as it provided a way to transport the coal to Sheffield and Rotherham, where it was used in the steelworks. This led to the rapid development of more and larger collieries. The population grew rapidly, but it was housed in small villages near the pits. With no urban infrastructure, sewage polluted the river, as did the industrial discharges from the mines.

Parts of the upper river were well suited to the woollen trade, and mills developed in the 19th century, at Denby Dale, Scissett and Clayton West. The valley of the upper river is quite narrow, and housing was provided by building terraces, which often backed on to the river. Again, sewage ended up in the river, as did the effluent from processing the wool, which included caustic washing agents and dyes. Water used in washing was returned to the river without adequate cooling, and the temperature rose. As early as 1896, the West Riding River Board was working hard to improve the situation, and achieved limited success by 1902, when they produced a report. They identified 44 small sewage treatment plants, none of which treated the sewage adequately, and noted that the river was &quot;much polluted by domestic sewage and by untreated or partially treated trade refuse.&quot; By the early 1900s, the river was lifeless between Barnsley and the Don, with fish unable to survive in the cocktail of chemicals. The River Dove was also lifeless, although the Cawthorne Dyke and several other small tributaries managed to retain populations of brown trout.

The situation had not improved by the 1960s, when the Yorkshire Ouse River Board noted that industrial waste from the mining, paper making, brewing and textile industries was being dumping into the river without any treatment. Pressure from the Board and from local authorities based along the river resulted in some treatment being carried out, but by 1974 much of the river was still rated as Class E on the six-point water quality scale, which indicated it was of poor quality, with some parts rated as Class F, meaning that they grossly polluted with little or no life. Nevertheless, small pockets of fish began to appear. A small population of brown trout had survived in the upper of the river, but could not proceed downstream due to dams erected for the woollen mills. Moth-proofing agents were released by the mills into the water, which were highly toxic to fish, and although the discharge of these chemicals ceased in 1979, when they were routed to a sewer for treatment, the problem did not immediately go away, as the chemicals continued to seep into the river from land which had been contaminated by them for another ten years. Any progress with the re-establishment of fish stocks was destroyed by a series of releases of pollutants into the river during the 1970s and 1980s.

===Improvements===
By 1987, water quality had improved sufficiently to try restocking the upper river, and large numbers of yearling trout were released into the river in April. A fish survey carried out by the Yorkshire Water Authority a year later showed that many of these were surviving. By 1992, there was evidence that the fish were breeding in the river, and naturally bred brown trout were found between Denby Dale and Clayton West in 1994, for the first time in over 100 years. The trout population in the upper Dearne was declared to be self-sustaining by 1996.

The river below Clayton West ceases to be a shallow, fast-flowing watercourse, and consists of deeper pools with a slower flow, which is suitable for various coarse fish as well as trout. By 1974, a modest improvement in water quality had been achieved by treatment of industrial effluent, and some fish managed to exist below the weir at the Star Paper Mill in Barnsley. The weir helped to oxygenate the water, and most of the fish had been washed downstream from Cannon Hall and Bretton Lakes. During flood conditions, many of the population would be washed further downstream, to be replaced by others from the lakes. A survey in 1982 found gudgeon, minnow and three-spined stickleback, which had increased by 1985, and over 10,000 coarse fish were released as part of a restocking programme. However, most of these were killed by serious pollution incidents that affected the river in 1987 and 1988, and incidents continued for a further three years. The sewage treatment works at Darton and Lundwood, on either side of Barnsley, were largely responsible.

Discharges from the Darton sewage treatment works contained residues from dyes used by a local carpet manufacturer, which reached the works by a foul sewer, but could not be adequately treated by the existing processes. As a result, the final effluent was a deep red colour, and was a major factor in the poor biochemical oxygen demand ratings for the river. Major improvements, including new primary settlement tanks and tertiary treatment lagoons, were made to the treatment works, and the carpet manufacturers installed facilities to treat their effluent before it was discharged to the sewer. By 1994, fish were again appearing below the Star Paper Mill weir, and Yorkshire Water and the Environment Agency carried out another fish restocking programme.

Improvements to water quality through Barnsley highlighted the fact that fish populations did not exist below the discharge from the Lundwood sewage treatment works to the east of Barnsley. As the population of Barnsley had increased, the volume of effluent received by the works had increased without a corresponding increase in its ability to treat it. In addition, the outfall reached the river along a stretch of the Cliffe Bridge Dyke, which had suffered from subsidence. This resulted in slow movement along the dyke, which sometimes caused the effluent to become septic before it reached the main channel. A major programme of refurbishment was carried out at the works between 1997 and 1998, to improve the quality of discharge. The fish populations on the lower river fluctuated, as a result of pollution incidents on the middle river, but by 1994, chub and dace were clearly breeding in the river. Breeding was assisted by re-engineering of the channel at Pastures Road, Denaby, which had been straightened in the 1960s after it was affected by subsidence. A series of bends were created, which encourage the formation of deep pools and shallow gravel riffles. These features are needed by dace and barbel for successful spawning, and prevent young fish from being washed downstream in flood conditions. Water quality has continued to improve, and the lower Dearne has become an important venue for angling.

Further improvements to the Lundwood sewage treatment works began in 2007 to enable it to comply with the Freshwater Fish Directive, and although the site was inundated during the floods of 2007, the scheme, which cost £8 million, was completed in 2008. To celebrate the opening of the new works, the poet Ian McMillan was asked to run a poetry workshop at Littleworth Grange Primary Learning Centre, where children completed a poem about water treatment for which he supplied the first two lines. In June 2015, the Environment Agency announced that salmon had returned to the Dearne for the first time in 150 years. This follows the opening of a fish ladder at Sprotborough weir in 2014.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC 26/6/15&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessment===
The Environment Agency measure the water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail. The Dearne and several of its tributaries are designated as &quot;heavily modified&quot;, which means that the channels have been altered by human activity, and the criteria for this designation are defined by the Water Framework Directive.

The water quality of the Dearne and its tributaries was as follows in 2019.

Like most rivers in the UK, the chemical status changed from good to fail in 2019, due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS), mercury compounds and cypermethrin, none of which had previously been included in the assessment.

<text>The Dearne Valley () is an area of South Yorkshire, England, along the River Dearne. It encompasses the towns of Wombwell, Wath-upon-Dearne, Swinton, Conisbrough and Mexborough, the large villages of Ardsley, Bolton on Dearne, Goldthorpe, Thurnscoe, Darfield, Stairfoot and Brampton Bierlow, and many other smaller villages and hamlets.

In 1995, the area became a regeneration area, as it had suffered much from the sudden decline of the deep coal mining industry in the 1980s. In the 2011 census, the ONS-identified Barnsley/Dearne Valley built-up area had a population of 223,281; however, this region includes Barnsley and certain other smaller towns and villages that might not historically have considered themselves a part of the Dearne Valley.

==History==
Many high-grade coal seams, including the prolific Barnsley seam, lie close to the surface in this area. This meant that by far the most prevalent industry in the area was deep coal mining, indeed much of the economic activity of the region was either directly related to, or reliant on this industry. It was home to the Oaks Viaduct, the largest man-made rail bridge in Britain until its demolition in 1965.

In the latter half of the 20th century, the industry was declining and becoming deeply unprofitable, but was kept alive by government subsidy. As early as the 1960s, local politicians voiced concerns about the high level of reliance of the economy of the area on one single industry. In the 1980s, there was a marked change of government economic policy: unprofitable heavy industry was to no longer be subsidised. This caused the collapse of the mining industry, with a knock-on effect in many other local industries, leading to much local hardship.

==The valley today==
Settlements in the area are becoming more dormitory in nature, as those who remained have found the need to commute further afield to the larger towns and cities in the region to work.

Outside the settlements, primary land use is agricultural: a byproduct of the end of the mining industry is that the area looks more rural and green than it once did. Business parks in the area have been created on brown-field land once used by the mining industry, the most notable and largest is at Manvers.

Much of the infrastructure related to the mining industry was demolished in the 1980s and early 1990s and the land changed to other uses and today few remnants of the coal mining heritage remain: the large spoil heaps have been levelled and grassed, and no coal mining remains at all in the area. Wath marshalling yard which served the railway coal traffic closed in 1988 is now the site of Old Moor Wetland Centre RSPB reserve. Other nature reserves in the valley include Gypsy Marsh, Wombwell Ings and Adwick Washlands.

The road and rail links to the villages of the area also were implemented mostly to ferry coal out of collieries and although the rails have been removed, the embankments, cuttings and bridges remain. Several of these former railways are now part of the Trans Pennine Trail between Southport and Hornsea. The Dearne Valley is at the centre of the trail with the main West/East and North/South routes crossing over in the area.

The historic region has a wide range of buildings and areas which are of major archeological interest and include 14 conservation areas, 15 scheduled ancient monuments, more than 249 listed buildings and above 50 landscapes which are considered to have special value. Some of the prominent buildings include Conisbrough Castle, Church of St. John and St. Mary Magdalene, Hickleton Hall, Glassby Arch, etc.

<text>In the mathematical classification of finite simple groups, there are a number of groups which do not fit into any infinite family. These are called the sporadic simple groups, or the sporadic finite groups, or just the sporadic groups.

A simple group is a group &quot;G&quot; that does not have any normal subgroups except for the trivial group and &quot;G&quot; itself. The mentioned classification theorem states that the list of finite simple groups consists of 18 countably infinite families plus 26 exceptions that do not follow such a systematic pattern. These 26 exceptions are the sporadic groups. The Tits group is sometimes regarded as a sporadic group because it is not strictly a group of Lie type, in which case there would be 27 sporadic groups.

The monster group, or &quot;friendly giant&quot;, is the largest of the sporadic groups, and all but six of the other sporadic groups are subquotients of it.

== Names ==

Five of the sporadic groups were discovered by Émile Mathieu in the 1860s and the other twenty-one were found between 1965 and 1975. Several of these groups were predicted to exist before they were constructed. Most of the groups are named after the mathematician(s) who first predicted their existence. The full list is:
* Mathieu groups &quot;M&quot;11, &quot;M&quot;12, &quot;M&quot;22, &quot;M&quot;23, &quot;M&quot;24
* Janko groups &quot;J&quot;1, &quot;J&quot;2 or &quot;HJ&quot;, &quot;J&quot;3 or &quot;HJM&quot;, &quot;J&quot;4
* Conway groups &quot;Co1&quot;, &quot;Co2&quot;, &quot;Co3&quot;
* Fischer groups &quot;Fi&quot;22, &quot;Fi&quot;23, &quot;Fi&quot;24′ or &quot;F&quot;3+
* Higman-Sims group &quot;HS&quot;
* McLaughlin group &quot;McL&quot;
* Held group &quot;He&quot; or &quot;F&quot;7+ or &quot;F&quot;7
* Rudvalis group &quot;Ru&quot;
* Suzuki group &quot;Suz&quot; or &quot;F&quot;3−
* O&#x27;Nan group &quot;O&#x27;N&quot; (ON)
* Harada-Norton group &quot;HN&quot; or &quot;F&quot;5+ or &quot;F&quot;5
* Lyons group &quot;Ly&quot;
* Thompson group &quot;Th&quot; or &quot;F&quot;3|3 or &quot;F&quot;3
* Baby Monster group &quot;B&quot; or &quot;F&quot;2+ or &quot;F&quot;2
* Fischer-Griess Monster group &quot;M&quot; or &quot;F&quot;1

Various constructions for these groups were first compiled in , including character tables, individual conjugacy classes and lists of maximal subgroup, as well as Schur multipliers and orders of their outer automorphisms. These are also listed online at , updated with their group presentations and semi-presentations. The degrees of minimal faithful representation or &quot;Brauer characters&quot; over fields of characteristic &quot;p&quot; ≥ 0 for all sporadic groups have also been calculated, and for some of their covering groups. These are detailed in .

A further exception in the classification of finite simple groups is the Tits group &quot;T&quot;, which is sometimes considered of Lie type or sporadic — it is almost but not strictly a group of Lie type — which is why in some sources the number of sporadic groups is given as 27, instead of 26. In some other sources, the Tits group is regarded as neither sporadic nor of Lie type, or both. The Tits group is the of the infinite family of commutator groups ; thus in a strict sense not sporadic, nor of Lie type. For these finite simple groups coincide with the groups of Lie type also known as Ree groups of type 2&quot;F&quot;4.

The earliest use of the term &quot;sporadic group&quot; may be where he comments about the Mathieu groups: &quot;These apparently sporadic simple groups would probably repay a closer examination than they have yet received.&quot; (At the time, the other sporadic groups had not been discovered.)

The diagram at right is based on . It does not show the numerous non-sporadic simple subquotients of the sporadic groups.

== Organization ==

=== Happy Family ===

Of the 26 sporadic groups, 20 can be seen inside the monster group as subgroups or quotients of subgroups (sections).
These twenty have been called the &quot;happy family&quot; by Robert Griess, and can be organized into three generations.

==== First generation (5 groups): the Mathieu groups ====

M&quot;n&quot; for &quot;n&quot; = 11, 12, 22, 23 and 24 are multiply transitive permutation groups on &quot;n&quot; points. They are all subgroups of M24, which is a permutation group on 24 points.

==== Second generation (7 groups): the Leech lattice ====

All the subquotients of the automorphism group of a lattice in 24 dimensions called the Leech lattice:

* &quot;Co&quot;1 is the quotient of the automorphism group by its center {±1}
* &quot;Co&quot;2 is the stabilizer of a type 2 (i.e., length 2) vector
* &quot;Co&quot;3 is the stabilizer of a type 3 (i.e., length ) vector
* &quot;Suz&quot; is the group of automorphisms preserving a complex structure (modulo its center)
* &quot;McL&quot; is the stabilizer of a type 2-2-3 triangle
* &quot;HS&quot; is the stabilizer of a type 2-3-3 triangle
* &quot;J&quot;2 is the group of automorphisms preserving a quaternionic structure (modulo its center).

==== Third generation (8 groups): other subgroups of the Monster ====

Consists of subgroups which are closely related to the Monster group &quot;M&quot;:

* &quot;B&quot; or &quot;F&quot;2 has a double cover which is the centralizer of an element of order 2 in &quot;M&quot;
* &quot;Fi&quot;24′ has a triple cover which is the centralizer of an element of order 3 in &quot;M&quot; (in conjugacy class &quot;3A&quot;)
* &quot;Fi&quot;23 is a subgroup of &quot;Fi&quot;24′
* &quot;Fi&quot;22 has a double cover which is a subgroup of &quot;Fi&quot;23
* The product of &quot;Th&quot; = &quot;F&quot;3 and a group of order 3 is the centralizer of an element of order 3 in &quot;M&quot; (in conjugacy class &quot;3C&quot;)
* The product of &quot;HN&quot; = &quot;F&quot;5 and a group of order 5 is the centralizer of an element of order 5 in &quot;M&quot;
* The product of &quot;He&quot; = &quot;F&quot;7 and a group of order 7 is the centralizer of an element of order 7 in &quot;M&quot;.
* Finally, the Monster group itself is considered to be in this generation.

(This series continues further: the product of &quot;M&quot;12 and a group of order 11 is the centralizer of an element of order 11 in &quot;M&quot;.)

The Tits group, if regarded as a sporadic group, would belong in this generation: there is a subgroup S4 ×2F4(2)′ normalising a 2C2 subgroup of &quot;B&quot;, giving rise to a subgroup 2·S4 ×2F4(2)′ normalising a certain Q8 subgroup of the Monster. 2F4(2)′ is also a subquotient of the Fischer group &quot;Fi&quot;22, and thus also of &quot;Fi&quot;23 and &quot;Fi&quot;24′, and of the Baby Monster &quot;B&quot;. 2F4(2)′ is also a subquotient of the (pariah) Rudvalis group &quot;Ru&quot;, and has no involvements in sporadic simple groups except the ones already mentioned.

=== Pariahs ===

The six exceptions are &quot;J&quot;1, &quot;J&quot;3, &quot;J&quot;4, &quot;O&#x27;N&quot;, &quot;Ru&quot;, and &quot;Ly&quot;, sometimes known as the pariahs.

<text>Amatol is a highly explosive material made from a mixture of TNT and ammonium nitrate. The British name originates from the words ammonium and toluene (the precursor of TNT). Similar mixtures (one part dinitronaphthalene and seven parts ammonium nitrate) were known as Schneiderite in France. Amatol was used extensively during World War I and World War II, typically as an explosive in military weapons such as aircraft bombs, shells, depth charges, and naval mines. It was eventually replaced with alternative explosives such as Composition B, Torpex, and Tritonal.

==Invention==
Following the Shell Crisis of 1915 in which the UK did not have enough ordnance due to a lack of explosives, a team at the Royal Arsenal laboratories produced a mixture of ammonium nitrate and TNT, known as Amatol for short. Special factories were constructed for the manufacture of ammonium nitrate by the double decomposition of sodium nitrate and ammonium sulfate in solution followed by evaporative concentration and crystallization. It became the standard filling for shells and bombs, and was later adopted by the US as their principal high explosive.

==Manufacture and use==
Amatol exploits synergy between TNT and ammonium nitrate. TNT has higher explosive velocity and brisance, but is deficient in oxygen. Oxygen deficiency causes black smoke residue from a pure TNT explosion. The oxygen surplus of ammonium nitrate increases the energy release of TNT during detonation. Depending on the ratio of ingredients used, amatol leaves a residue of white or grey smoke after detonation. Amatol has a lower explosive velocity and correspondingly lower brisance than TNT but is cheaper because of the lower cost of ammonium nitrate. 

Amatol allowed supplies of TNT to be expanded considerably, with little reduction in the destructive power of the final product, so long as the amount of TNT in the mixture did not fall below 60%. Mixtures containing as little as 20% TNT were for less demanding uses.

TNT is 50% deficient in oxygen. Amatol is oxygen balanced and is therefore more effective than pure TNT when exploding underground or underwater. Relatively unsophisticated cannery equipment can be adapted to amatol production. TNT is gently heated with steam or hot water until it melts, acquiring the physical characteristics of a syrup. Then the correct weight ratio of powdered ammonium nitrate is added and mixed in. Whilst this mixture is still in a molten state, it is poured into empty bomb casings and allowed to cool and solidify. The lowest grades of amatol could not be produced by casting molten TNT. Instead, flaked TNT was thoroughly mixed with powdered ammonium nitrate and then compressed or extruded.

Amatol ranges from off-white to slightly yellow or pinkish brown depending on the mixture used, and remains soft for long periods of storage. It is hygroscopic, which complicates long-term storage. To prevent moisture problems, amatol charges were coated with a thin layer of pure molten TNT or alternatively bitumen. Long-term storage was rare during wars because munitions charged with amatol were generally used soon after manufacture.

Amatol should not be stored in containers made from copper or brass, as it can form unstable compounds sensitive to vibration. Pressed, it is relatively insensitive but may be detonated by severe impact, whereas when cast, it is extremely insensitive. Primary explosives such as mercury fulminate were often used as a detonator, in combination with an explosive booster charge such as tetryl.

The explosive charges hidden in HMS &quot;Campbeltown&quot; during the St. Nazaire Raid of 1942 contained amatol. The British X class midget submarines which planted explosive charges beneath the German battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot; in September 1943 carried two &quot;saddle charges&quot; containing four tons of amatol. Warheads for the German V-1 flying bomb and V-2 rockets also contained amatol.

A derivative of amatol is amatex, consisting of 51% ammonium nitrate, 40% TNT, and 9% RDX (which also has a negative oxygen balance).

==Ammonite==
Amatol is rare today, except in legacy munitions or unexploded ordnance. Ammonite, a form of amatol, is a civil engineering explosive popular in Eastern Europe and China. Generally comprising a 20/80 mixture of TNT and ammonium nitrate it is typically used for quarrying or mining.

Because the proportion of TNT is significantly lower than in its military counterpart, ammonite has much less destructive power. In general, a 30 kilogram charge of ammonite is roughly equivalent to 20 kilograms of TNT.

==Amatol, New Jersey==
Amatol was the name given to a munitions factory and planned community built by the United States government in Mullica Township, New Jersey during World War I. After the war, the town was dismantled. The Atlantic City Speedway was built on part of the Amatol site in 1926. The site (including the speedway) is presently (2020) abandoned.

<text>Clarence Harry Willcock (23 January 1896 – 12 December 1952) was a British Liberal Party activist and dry cleaning firm manager. He is best remembered for being the last person in the United Kingdom to be prosecuted for refusing to produce an identity card, a wartime requirement introduced in 1939 but which was continued after the war by the post-war Attlee government.

== Life ==
Willcock was born in Alverthorpe, Wakefield, Yorkshire, the illegitimate son of Harry Cruickshank, a native of Leeds who worked in the textile trade, and Ella Brooke, whose family were wholesalers to tailors. He was adopted by a widow, Mary Willcock, whose surname he adopted. During World War I he served with the Northumberland Fusiliers, but was not sent overseas.

He was active in Liberal politics – a councillor and magistrate in Horsforth – then stood for Parliament as candidate in Barking in 1945 and 1950, coming third – last (at the first exceeding 12.5% of the vote, at which his deposit was refunded). At the time of the events which gave rise to &quot;Willcock v. Muckle&quot;, he was the manager of a successful dry cleaning firm in London.

== &quot;Willcock v. Muckle&quot; ==
Compulsory identity cards had been re-introduced in World War II under the National Registration Act 1939. After the war, in 1945, the Attlee government chose to continue them.

On 7 December 1950, Willcock was stopped for speeding on Ballard&#x27;s Lane, North Finchley, London. Police Constable Harold Muckle asked him to produce his card. Willcock refused, reportedly saying &quot;I am a Liberal, and I am against this sort of thing&quot;. Muckle gave Willcock a form to produce his card at any police station within two days, to which Willcock replied &quot;I will not produce it at any police station and I will not accept the form&quot;. He then threw the form on the ground. Willcock failed to produce the form within this time, and was prosecuted under the Act.

To the Highgate justices, he argued that the power to require the production of such a card had lapsed when the state of emergency which led to the passage of the Act had expired. The justices rejected this, but gave him an absolute discharge. Separately, he was fined 30s for speeding.

He appealed the guilty but no-reprimand verdict to the High Court by way of case stated (meaning the bench agreed a certified point of law had arisen). Unusually, this was heard by a bench of seven judges in a divisional court, which included the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Goddard, and Sir Raymond Evershed MR. His defence team comprised prominent Liberals including Archibald Pellow Marshall KC, Emrys Roberts MP, and Basil Wigoder, who offered their services free. Sir Frank Soskice, the Attorney General, appeared as &quot;amicus curiae&quot;.

The verdict was upheld. A majority of the Court (Lord Goddard CJ, Somervell and Jenkins LJJ, Hilbery and Lynskey JJ; against Evershed MR and Devlin J &quot;dubitantibus&quot;) held that the Act remained in force, as no Order in Council had specifically terminated it. However, Lord Goddard was critical of the Government:

:&quot;This Act was passed for security purposes; it was never passed for the purposes for which it is now apparently being used. To use Acts of Parliament passed for particular purposes in wartime when the war is a thing of the past—except for the technicality that a state of war exists—tends to turn law-abiding subjects into lawbreakers, which is a most undesirable state of affairs. Further, in this country we have always prided ourselves on the good feeling that exists between the police and the public, and such action tends to make the people resentful of the acts of the police, and inclines them to obstruct the police instead of assisting them. For these reasons I hope that if a similar case comes before any other bench of justices, they will deal with it as did the Highgate bench and grant the defendant an absolute discharge, except where there is a real reason for demanding sight of the registration card.&quot;

The Court dismissed the appeal, but did not award costs against Willcock.

== Aftermath and later life ==
For this, Willcock became well-known and he founded the Freedom Defence Association to campaign against identity cards. In a publicity event, he tore up his own identity card in front of the National Liberal Club, inspiring in April 1951 a similar action for the press outside Parliament by the British Housewives&#x27; League.

The Party&#x27;s stance to the campaign was soon cast as &#x27;half-hearted&#x27;, possibly as he was aligned with the free-trade wing – the issue of identity cards was left out of its manifesto for the 1951 elections.

Defeating the Labour government in the general election of 1951, the Conservative government of Winston Churchill put to Conference abolition to &#x27;set the people free&#x27;, in the words of a minister. On 21 February 1952 the Minister of Health, Harry Crookshank, announced in the Commons that the cards were to be scrapped. This was a popular move but against the consensus of the police and the security services.

On abolition Willcock was sent hundreds of cards, via post, to auction for charity. In 1952, he forced an election for the four honorary vice-presidents of the Liberal Party, but lost.

He died suddenly while debating at a meeting of the Eighty Club at the Reform Club. The last word on his lips before his death was reported to have been &quot;freedom.&quot;

Willcock is commemorated by a plaque in the National Liberal Club. Former Deputy Prime Minister and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg has described Willcock as one of his heroes.

<text>Henrietta Lacks (born Loretta Pleasant; August 1, 1920 – October 4, 1951) was an African-American woman whose cancer cells are the source of the HeLa cell line, the first immortalized human cell line and one of the most important cell lines in medical research. An immortalized cell line reproduces indefinitely under specific conditions, and the HeLa cell line continues to be a source of invaluable medical data to the present day. 

Lacks was the unwitting source of these cells from a tumor biopsied during treatment for cervical cancer at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1951. These cells were then cultured by George Otto Gey, who created the cell line known as HeLa, which is still used for medical research. As was then the practice, no consent was required to culture the cells obtained from Lacks&#x27;s treatment. Neither she nor her family were compensated for the extraction or use of the HeLa cells.

Even though some information about the origins of HeLa&#x27;s immortalized cell lines was known to researchers after 1970, the Lacks family was not made aware of the line&#x27;s existence until 1975. With knowledge of the cell line&#x27;s genetic provenance becoming public, its use for medical research and for commercial purposes continues to raise concerns about privacy and patients&#x27; rights.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Henrietta Lacks was born Loretta Pleasant on August 1, 1920, in Roanoke, Virginia, to Eliza Pleasant (née Lacks) (1886–1924) and John &quot;Johnny&quot; Randall Pleasant (1881–1969). She is remembered as having hazel eyes, a small waist, size 6 shoes, and always wearing red nail polish and a neatly pleated skirt. Her family is uncertain how her name changed from Loretta to Henrietta, but she was nicknamed Hennie. When Lacks was four years old in 1924, her mother died giving birth to her tenth child. Unable to care for the children alone after his wife&#x27;s death, Lacks&#x27;s father moved the family to Clover, Virginia, where the children were distributed among relatives. Lacks ended up with her maternal grandfather, Thomas &quot;Tommy&quot; Henry Lacks, in a two-story log cabin that was once the slave quarters on the plantation that had been owned by Henrietta&#x27;s white great-grandfather and great-uncle. She shared a room with her nine-year-old first cousin and future husband, David &quot;Day&quot; Lacks (1915–2002).

Like most members of her family living in Clover, Lacks worked as a tobacco farmer starting from an early age. She fed the animals, tended the garden, and toiled in the tobacco fields. She attended the designated black school two miles away from the cabin until she had to drop out to help support the family when she was in the sixth grade. When Lacks was 14 years old, she gave birth to a son, Lawrence Lacks (1935–2023). In 1939, her daughter Elsie Lacks (1939–1955) was born. Both children were fathered by Day Lacks. Elsie had epilepsy and cerebral palsy and was described by the family as &quot;different&quot; or &quot;deaf and dumb&quot;.

===Marriage and family===
On April 10, 1941, David &quot;Day&quot; Lacks and Henrietta Lacks were married in Halifax County, Virginia. Later that year, their cousin, Fred Garrett, convinced the couple to leave the tobacco farm in Virginia and move to Turner Station, near Dundalk, Maryland, in Baltimore County, so Day could work in Bethlehem Steel at Sparrows Point, Maryland. Not long after they moved to Maryland, Garrett was called to fight in World War II. With the savings gifted to him by Garrett, Day Lacks was able to purchase a house at 713 New Pittsburgh Avenue in Turner Station. Now part of Dundalk, Turner Station was one of the oldest and largest African-American communities in Baltimore County at that time.

Living in Maryland, Henrietta and Day Lacks had three more children: David &quot;Sonny&quot; Lacks Jr. (1947–2022), Deborah Lacks (later known as Deborah Lacks Pullum, 1949–2009), and Joseph Lacks (later known as Zakariyya Bari Abdul Rahman after converting to Islam, 1950–2020). Henrietta gave birth to her last child at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore in November 1950, four and a half months before she was diagnosed with cervical cancer. Zakariyya believed his birth to be a miracle as he was &quot;fighting off the cancer cells growing all around him&quot;. Around the same time, Elsie was placed in the Hospital for the Negro Insane, later renamed Crownsville Hospital Center, where she died in 1955 at 15 years of age. Historian Paul Lurz says that it is possible that Elsie was subjected to the pneumoencephalography procedure, where a hole was drilled into a patient&#x27;s head to drain fluid from the brain, which was then replaced with oxygen or helium to make it easier to see the patient&#x27;s brain in X-rays.

Both Lacks and her husband were Catholic.

===Illness===

====Diagnosis and treatment====
On January 29, 1951, Lacks went to Johns Hopkins, the only hospital in the area that treated black patients, because she felt a &quot;knot&quot; in her womb. She had previously told her cousins about the &quot;knot&quot; and they assumed correctly that she was pregnant. But after giving birth to Joseph, Lacks had a severe hemorrhage. Her primary care doctor, William C. Wade, referred her back to Johns Hopkins. There, her doctor, Howard W. Jones, took a biopsy of a mass found on Lacks&#x27;s cervix for laboratory testing. Soon after, Lacks was told that she had a malignant epidermoid carcinoma of the cervix. In 1970, physicians discovered that she had been misdiagnosed and actually had an adenocarcinoma. This was a common mistake at the time, and the treatment would not have differed.

Lacks was treated with radium tube inserts as an inpatient and discharged a few days later with instructions to return for X-ray treatments as a follow-up. During her treatments, two samples were taken from Lacks&#x27;s cervix without her permission or knowledge; one sample was of healthy tissue and the other was cancerous. These samples were given to George Otto Gey, a physician and cancer researcher at Johns Hopkins. The cells from the cancerous sample eventually became known as the HeLa immortal cell line, a commonly used cell line in contemporary biomedical research.

===Death and burial===
On August 8, 1951, Lacks, who was 31 years old, went to Johns Hopkins for a routine treatment session and asked to be admitted due to continued severe abdominal pain. She received blood transfusions and remained at the hospital until her death on October 4, 1951. A partial autopsy showed that the cancer had metastasized throughout her entire body.
Lacks was buried in an unmarked grave in the family cemetery, in a section of Clover, Virginia, called Lackstown. Lacks&#x27;s exact burial location is unknown, but the family believes that it is within a few feet of her mother&#x27;s gravesite, which for decades was the only one in the family to have been marked with a tombstone. In 2010, Roland Pattillo, a faculty member of the Morehouse School of Medicine who had worked with George Gey and knew the Lacks family, donated a headstone for Lacks. This prompted her family to raise money for a headstone for Elsie Lacks as well, which was dedicated on the same day. The book-shaped headstone of Henrietta Lacks contains an epitaph written by her grandchildren that reads:
==Medical and scientific research==
George Otto Gey, the first researcher to study Lacks&#x27;s cancerous cells, observed that these cells were unusual in that they reproduced at a very high rate and could be kept alive long enough to allow more in-depth examination. Until then, cells cultured for laboratory studies survived for only a few days at most, which was not long enough to perform a variety of different tests on the same sample. Lacks&#x27;s cells were the first to be observed that could be divided multiple times without dying, which is why they became known as &quot;immortal&quot;. After Lacks&#x27;s death, Gey had Mary Kubicek, his lab assistant, take further HeLa samples while Henrietta&#x27;s body was at Johns Hopkins&#x27; autopsy facility. The roller-tube technique was the method used to culture the cells obtained from the samples that Kubicek collected. Gey was able to start a cell line from Lacks&#x27;s sample by isolating one specific cell and repeatedly dividing it, meaning that the same cell could then be used for conducting many experiments. They became known as HeLa cells, because Gey&#x27;s standard method for labeling samples was to use the first two letters of the patient&#x27;s first and last names.

The ability to rapidly reproduce HeLa cells in a laboratory setting has led to many important breakthroughs in biomedical research. For example, by 1954, Jonas Salk was using HeLa cells in his research to develop the polio vaccine. To test his new vaccine, the cells were mass-produced in the first-ever cell production factory. Additionally, Chester M. Southam, a leading virologist, injected HeLa cells into cancer patients, prison inmates, and healthy individuals in order to observe whether cancer could be transmitted as well as to examine if one could become immune to cancer by developing an acquired immune response.

HeLa cells were in high demand and put into mass production. They were mailed to scientists around the globe for &quot;research into cancer, AIDS, the effects of radiation and toxic substances, gene mapping, and countless other scientific pursuits&quot;. HeLa cells were the first human cells successfully cloned, in 1955, and have since been used to test human sensitivity to tape, glue, cosmetics, and many other products. There are almost 11,000 patents involving HeLa cells.

In the early 1970s, a large portion of other cell cultures became contaminated by HeLa cells. As a result, members of Henrietta Lacks&#x27;s family received solicitations for blood samples from researchers hoping to learn about the family&#x27;s genetics in order to differentiate between HeLa cells and other cell lines.

Alarmed and confused, several family members began questioning why they were receiving so many telephone calls requesting blood samples. In 1975, the family also learned through a chance dinner-party conversation that material originating in Henrietta Lacks was continuing to be used for medical research. Prior to this, the family had never discussed Henrietta&#x27;s illness and death among themselves.

===Consent issues and privacy concerns===
Neither Henrietta Lacks nor her family had given her physicians permission to harvest her cells. At that time, permission was neither required nor customarily sought. The cells were used in medical research and for commercial purposes. In the 1980s, family medical records were published without family consent. A similar issue was brought up in the Supreme Court of California case of &quot;Moore v. Regents of the University of California&quot; in 1990. The court ruled that a person&#x27;s discarded tissue and cells are not their property and can be commercialized.

In March 2013, researchers published the DNA sequence of the genome of a strain of HeLa cells. The Lacks family discovered this when the author Rebecca Skloot informed them. There were objections from the Lacks family about the genetic information that was available for public access. Jeri Lacks Whye, a grandchild of Henrietta Lacks, said to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;the biggest concern was privacy—what information was actually going to be out there about our grandmother, and what information they can obtain from her sequencing that will tell them about her children and grandchildren and going down the line.&quot; That same year another group working on a different HeLa cell line&#x27;s genome under National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding, submitted it for publication. In August 2013, an agreement was announced between the family and the NIH that gave the family some control over access to the cells&#x27; DNA sequence found in the two studies along with a promise of acknowledgement in scientific papers. In addition, two family members will join the six-member committee that will regulate access to the sequence data.

In October 2021, Lacks&#x27;s estate filed a lawsuit against Thermo Fisher Scientific for profiting from the HeLa cell line without Lacks&#x27;s consent, asking for &quot;the full amount of [Thermo Fisher&#x27;s] net profits&quot;. On July 31, 2023, Thermo Fisher Scientific settled with the Lacks family on undisclosed terms.

==Recognition==
In 1996, Morehouse School of Medicine held its first annual HeLa Women&#x27;s Health Conference. Led by physician Roland Pattillo, the conference is held to give recognition to Henrietta Lacks, her cell line, and &quot;the valuable contribution made by African Americans to medical research and clinical practice&quot;. The mayor of Atlanta declared the date of the first conference, October 11, 1996, &quot;Henrietta Lacks Day&quot;.

Lacks&#x27;s contributions continue to be celebrated at yearly events in Turner Station. At one such event in 1997, then-U.S. Congressman from Maryland, Robert Ehrlich, presented a congressional resolution recognizing Lacks and her contributions to medical science and research.

In 2010, the Johns Hopkins Institute for Clinical and Translational Research established the annual Henrietta Lacks Memorial Lecture Series, to honor Henrietta Lacks and the global impact of HeLa cells on medicine and research.

In 2011, Morgan State University in Baltimore granted Lacks a posthumous honorary doctorate in public service. Also in 2011, the Evergreen School District in Vancouver, Washington, named their new high school focused on medical careers the Henrietta Lacks Health and Bioscience High School, becoming the first organization to memorialize her publicly by naming a school in her honor.

In 2014, Lacks was inducted into the Maryland Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame. In 2017, a minor planet in the main asteroid belt was named &quot;359426 Lacks&quot; in her honor.

In 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a belated obituary for her, as part of the Overlooked history project. Also in 2018, the National Portrait Gallery and the National Museum of African-American History and Culture jointly announced the accession of a portrait of Lacks by Kadir Nelson.

On October 6, 2018, Johns Hopkins University announced plans to name a research building in honor of Lacks. The announcement was made at the 9th annual Henrietta Lacks Memorial Lecture in the Turner Auditorium in East Baltimore by Johns Hopkins University President Ronald J. Daniels and Paul B. Rothman, CEO of Johns Hopkins Medicine and dean of the medical faculty of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, surrounded by several of Lacks&#x27;s descendants. &quot;Through her life and her immortal cells, Henrietta Lacks made an immeasurable impact on science and medicine that has touched countless lives around the world,&quot; Daniels said. &quot;This building will stand as a testament to her transformative impact on scientific discovery and the ethics that must undergird its pursuit. We at Johns Hopkins are profoundly grateful to the Lacks family for their partnership as we continue to learn from Mrs. Lacks&#x27;s life and to honor her enduring legacy.&quot; The building will adjoin the Berman Institute of Bioethics&#x27; Deering Hall, located at the corner of Ashland and Rutland Avenues and &quot;will support programs that enhance participation and partnership with members of the community in research that can benefit the community, as well as extend the opportunities to further study and promote research ethics and community engagement in research through an expansion of the Berman Institute and its work.&quot;

In 2020, Lacks was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

In 2021, the Henrietta Lacks Enhancing Cancer Research Act of 2019 became law; it states the Government Accountability Office must complete a study about barriers to participation that exist in cancer clinical trials that are federally funded for populations that have been underrepresented in such trials.

In October 2021, the University of Bristol unveiled a statue of Lacks at Royal Fort House in the city. The sculpture was created by Helen Wilson-Roe and was the first statue of a black woman made by a black woman for a public space in the United Kingdom.

On October 13, 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) presented the Director General Award to Lawrence Lacks, the son of Henrietta Lacks, in recognition of her unknowing contribution to science and medicine. Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist at the WHO, said: &quot;I cannot think of any other single cell line or lab reagent that&#x27;s been used to this extent and has resulted in so many advances.&quot;

On March 15, 2022, United States Rep. Kwesi Mfume (D-Md) filed legislation to posthumously award the Congressional Gold Medal to Henrietta Lacks for her distinguished contributions to science. The award is one of the most prestigious civilian honors given by the United States government.

On December 19, 2022, it was announced that a bronze statue honoring Henrietta Lacks would be erected in Roanoke, Virginia&#x27;s Henrietta Lacks Plaza, previously named Lee Plaza after Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. A statue of Lee was removed from the site in the wake of the protests following the murder of George Floyd. The Lacks statue was unveiled on October 4, 2023.

On June 13, 2023, Loudoun County Public Schools Board members approved naming a new school Henrietta Lacks Elementary School in Aldie, Virginia. The school serves more than 800 students from preschool through 2nd grade and opened in August 2024.

===In popular culture===
The question of how and whether her race affected her treatment, the lack of obtaining consent, and her relative obscurity continues to be controversial. In the medical world, this case brings up bioethical concerns with informed consent, medical records privacy, and communication with tissue donors and research participants.

The HeLa cell line&#x27;s connection to Henrietta Lacks was first brought to popular attention in March 1976 with a pair of articles in the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; written by reporter Michael Rogers, though Rogers erroneously states her name as Helen Lane. In 1998, Adam Curtis directed a BBC documentary about Henrietta Lacks called &quot;The Way of All Flesh&quot;.

Rebecca Skloot documented extensive histories of both the HeLa cell line and the Lacks family in two articles published in 2000 and 2001 and in her 2010 book &quot;The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks&quot;. Skloot worked with Deborah Lacks, who was determined to learn more about her mother, on the book. She used her first royalty check from the book to start the Henrietta Lacks Foundation, which has provided funds like college tuition and medical procedures for Henrietta&#x27;s family.

HBO announced in 2010 that Oprah Winfrey and Alan Ball were developing a film project based on Skloot&#x27;s book, and in 2016 filming commenced. with Winfrey in the leading role of Deborah Lacks, Henrietta&#x27;s daughter. The film &quot;The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks&quot; was released in 2017, with Renée Elise Goldsberry portraying Lacks. Sons David Lacks Jr. and Zakariyya Rahman and granddaughter Jeri Lacks were consultants for the film.

HBO also commissioned Kadir Nelson for an oil painting of Lacks. In 2018, the portrait was jointly acquired by the National Museum of African American History and Culture and the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Portrait Gallery. The wallpaper in the painting is made up of the &quot;Flower of Life&quot; alluding to the immortality of her cells. The flowers on her dress resemble images of cell structures, and the two missing buttons on her dress symbolize her cells taken without permission.

NBC&#x27;s &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; aired its own fictionalized version of Lacks&#x27;s story in the 2010 episode &quot;Immortal&quot;, which &quot;Slate&quot; referred to as &quot;shockingly close to the true story&quot; and the musical groups Jello Biafra and the Guantanamo School of Medicine and Yeasayer both released songs about Henrietta Lacks and her legacy.

Members of the Lacks family wrote their own stories for the first time in 2013, when Lacks&#x27;s oldest son and his wife, Lawrence and Bobbette Lacks, wrote a short digital memoir called &quot;Hela Family Stories: Lawrence and Bobbette&quot;, with first-hand accounts of their memories of Henrietta Lacks while she was alive and of their own efforts to keep the youngest children out of unsafe living environments following their mother&#x27;s death.

The HeLa Project, a multimedia exhibition to honor Lacks, opened in 2017 in Baltimore at the Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History &amp; Culture. It included a portrait by Kadir Nelson and a poem by Saul Williams.

&quot;HeLa&quot;, a play by Chicago playwright J. Nicole Brooks, was commissioned by Sideshow Theatre Company in 2016, with a public staged reading on July 31, 2017. The play was produced by Sideshow at Chicago&#x27;s Greenhouse Theater Center from November 18 to December 23, 2018. The play uses Lacks&#x27;s life story as a jumping point for a larger conversation about Afrofuturism, scientific progress, and bodily autonomy.

In the series &quot;El Ministerio del Tiempo&quot;, the immortality of her cells in the lab is cited as the precedent for the character Arteche&#x27;s &quot;extreme resistance to infections, to injuries, and to cellular degeneration. In other words to aging&quot;: that his cells are immortal.

In the Netflix original movie &quot;Project Power&quot; (2020), the case of Henrietta Lacks is cited by one of the villains of the story as an example of unwilling trials giving rise to advances for the greater good.

The JJ Doom album &quot;Key to the Kuffs&quot; (2012) includes the song &quot;Winter Blues&quot; that contains the lyrics &quot;We could live forever like Henrietta Lacks cells&quot;.

Yeasayer wrote a song about Lacks, entitled &quot;Henrietta,&quot; for their 2012 album &quot;Fragrant World&quot;.

In 2020, playwright Sandra Seaton wrote a one-woman piece titled &quot;Call Me By My Name,&quot; focusing on Henrietta Lacks. The piece was performed by actress Tracey Bonner at the 2020 Atlanta Black Theatre Festival, depicting Henrietta Lacks discussing her life and the impact she had on science, eventually demanding that people &#x27;call me by my name&#x27; when referencing the breakthroughs made possible by the study of the tumors that ended her life.

<text>Bradypodion (meaning &quot;slow-footed&quot; in Greek) is a genus of chameleons in the family Chamaeleonidae, collectively called South African dwarf chameleons. All species are found in South Africa and most are endemic to this country, but a few can also be found in Eswatini, Lesotho, southernmost Namibia and possibly southernmost Mozambique. They are quite small chameleons where the different species often can be difficult to separate by appearance, although exact location (each species tends to have a rather small distribution) and the intense breeding colours of males are useful for their identification. They are arboreal, but some species are mostly found low in the vegetation.

&quot;Bradypodion&quot; feed on small invertebrates, especially insects. They rapidly reach sexual maturity, typically at an age between half a year and one year, but sometimes up to two years. Adult males are territorial. It is the only genus of chameleon where females of all species give birth to live young rather than lay eggs (the only other chameleons that give birth to live young are certain &quot;Trioceros&quot; species). This is likely an adaption to the relatively cold climate of southern Africa in comparison to tropical Africa. Colder temperatures slow the development of eggs laid in the ground; when instead retained inside the body until birth, a female can actively sun bask to increase the temperature. A female can give birth to up to 20 young per time, twice or rarely even three times in a year.

Up until the early 2000s, some other chameleons from eastern and central Africa were occasionally placed herein, but they are now placed in &quot;Kinyongia&quot; and &quot;Nadzikambia&quot;.

==Species==
20 species are currently recognized:
==Undescribed species==

* Emerald dwarf chameleon, &quot;Bradypodion&quot; sp. (Emerald)
* &quot;Bradypodion&quot; sp. (Groendal)
* &quot;Bradypodion&quot; sp. (Grootvadersbosch)
* &quot;Bradypodion&quot; sp. (Jagersbos)

==Systematics==
Delimitation of &quot;Bradypodion&quot; has been controversial for some time. Most species seem readily distinguishable by morphological characteristics, but for some time the genus was used as a wastebin taxon for smaller chameleons from sub-Saharan Africa with plesiomorphic hemipenises. Alternatively, many of the present species were reduced to subspecies status. This has since been refuted, but several more species seem recognizable judging from morphological and mitochondrial 16S rRNA and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 sequence data.

The phylogeny and biogeography of this group is quite consistently resolved. The Cape dwarf chameleon and the Knysna dwarf chameleon (and possibly one new species close to it) are basal lineages with unclear relationships; they seem a bit closer to each other than to any other species, but altogether are quite distant. They occur in isolated ranges in coastal Western Cape and western Eastern Cape provinces. Inhabiting a wide range of habitats, they are (for the genus) large, and have brilliant, predominantly green coloration and long tails - just as in many &quot;Chamaeleo&quot;. These characters are plesiomorphic, retained from the genus&#x27; ancestor.

The remaining species form a well-supported clade, which in turn can be divided into smaller groups. One consists of forms that radiated on the seawards slopes of the Drakensberg Mountains: the southern Drakensberg dwarf chameleon, the northern Transvaal dwarf chameleon, and what appears to be undescribed species from the Ngome Forest on the southeastern slopes. These are also plesiomorphic in &quot;habitus&quot; and habits.

Another group of taxa occurs from easternmost Eastern Cape to central KwaZulu-Natal provinces, between Gilboa Forest and the Tugela River. These inhabit a wide range of habitat and contain the plesiomorphic Natal Midlands dwarf chameleon from the namesake region, the small black-headed dwarf chameleon which inhabits fynbos and other low forest on slopes of mainly coastal KwaZulu-Natal, and another probable new species from the Gilboa Forest area. These appear to be a quite recent radiation from a single ancestor, and the group requires more research as regards species limits, and geographical delimitation from the Drakensberg dwarf chameleon.

Several largish but short-tailed and cryptic taxa inhabit more arid habitats such as karoo. The Karroo and southern dwarf chameleons seem to have considerable gene flow range from Northern Cape to coastal Eastern Cape provinces. The small and nearly extinct Smith&#x27;s dwarf chameleon is close to these; it occurs on the escarpment inland from Jeffreys Bay. Less closely related is the Robertson dwarf chameleon, another aridland species which is found in Western Cape province inland from the range of the Cape dwarf chameleon and may be a cryptic species complex, and an undescribed population from the Swartberg Mountains. The last species with aridland apomorphies, the Namaqua dwarf chameleon, is quite distant to the others; it occurs in coastal regions from north of the Cape species through Namaqualand. This is probably still a part of a single radiation which brought about all the aridland taxa, and eventually Smith&#x27;s dwarf chameleon.

The remaining species are all small inhabitants of forested slopes and fynbos, such as the black-headed and Smith&#x27;s dwarf chameleons. However, as already indicated by the distinctness of these two, their morphologies seem to be a convergent adaptation. The Kentani and Transkei dwarf chameleons from the east coasts of Eastern Cape may or may not be each other&#x27;s closest relatives. Setaro&#x27;s dwarf chameleon from northeastern coastal KwaZulu-Natal is not close to these. The Zululand dwarf chameleon from western uThungulu apparently consists of two or more species, one that may be closer to the preceding, and one that might be an early offshoot of the ancestral Drakensberg stock, and which are distinguishable by morphological and mtDNA characteristics.

In conclusion, of the three basic morphotypes found in this genus, one (bright, long-tailed, large) is plesiomorphic, another (large, short-tailed, drab) apparently only evolved once, and the third (the small, slope-inhabiting forms) are convergent in morphology. The ancestors of &quot;Bradypodion&quot; thus were mid-sized chameleons with vivid color, which settled the Cape region from roughly north-northwestwards. Due to climate changes with fluctuating aridity, the basal lineages inhabiting humid fynbos in the southwest became isolated from each other and from the animals living around the border region between Northern and Eastern Cape and Free State, and Lesotho. The aridland habitat fluctuates in extent during climate shifts, and mountainous habitat becomes fragmented or consolidates accordingly. Consequently, the Drakensberg, the &quot;B. thamnobates&quot;-&quot;B. melanocephalum&quot;, and the aridland group, as well as several coastal lineages, diverged and evolved to their present-day ranges and diversity.

<text>Calumma is a genus of chameleons, highly adapted and specialised lizards, in the family Chamaeleonidae. The genus is endemic to the island of Madagascar. One species, formerly known as &quot;Calumma tigris&quot; (the Seychelles tiger chameleon), was transferred to the genus &quot;Archaius&quot; in 2010, upon the discovery of its closer relation to &quot;Rieppeleon&quot;—one of several genera referred to collectively as &quot;leaf&quot; or &quot;pygmy&quot; chameleons—rather than to &quot;Calumma&quot;. The earliest known fossil of the genus is of &quot;Calumma benovskyi&quot;, from early Miocene Kenya, showing that the genus likely originated on mainland East Africa. The genus includes one of the heaviest and longest chameleon species, the Parson&#x27;s chameleon (&quot;Calumma parsonii&quot;).

==Species groups==
Four species groups are recognised within the genus &quot;Calumma&quot; (originally proposed by Glaw &amp; Vences in 1994), some of which may be only phenetic, while others are phylogenetically supported:

===&quot;Calumma furcifer&quot; species group===
Contents: &quot;Calumma furcifer, C. gastrotaenia, C. marojezense, C. guillaumeti, C. andringitraense, C. glawi, C. vencesi&quot;

Species characterised by typically green body colouration, sleek body form, and generally no occipital lobes (flaps of skin posterior to the head; present only in &quot;C. glawi&quot;) and no rostral appendage (present only in males of &quot;C. furcifer&quot;).

===&quot;Calumma cucullatum&quot; species group===
Contents: &quot;Calumma cucullatum, C. crypticum, C. amber, C. tsaratananense, C. hafahafa, C. hilleniusi, C. peltierorum, C. malthe, C. brevicorne, C. jejy, C. tsycorne&quot;

Species characterised by distinct occipital lobes and generally a single bony rostral appendage that is larger in males than females.

===&quot;Calumma nasutum&quot; species group===
Contents: &quot;Calumma nasutum, C. fallax, C. gallus, C. guibei, C. boettgeri, C. linotum, C. gehringi, C. uetzi, C. lefona, C. juliae&quot;, &quot;C. vatosoa, C. vohibola, C. peyrierasi, C. roaloko&quot;

Species characterised by a soft dermal rostral appendage (generally present in males and absent in females). The following members possess occipital lobes: &quot;C. guibei, C. boettgeri, C. linotum, C. gehringi, C. uetzi, C. lefona, C. roaloko,&quot; and &quot;C. juliae.&quot; These taxa are collectively referred to as the &quot;C. guibei&quot; species complex. Occipital lobes are absent from all other species. The assignment of &quot;C. peyrierasi&quot; to this group remains a subject of uncertainty.

===&quot;Calumma parsonii&quot; species group===
Contents: &quot;Calumma globifer, C. ambreense, C. oshaughnessyi, C. parsonii, C. capuroni&quot;

Species characterised by large body size, males with paired rostral appendages, and some species with small occipital lobes.

<doc id="324815" wikidata="Q213485" url="?curid=324815" title="Lerwick">
<text>Lerwick ( or ; ; ) is the main town and port of the Shetland archipelago, Scotland. Shetland&#x27;s only burgh, Lerwick had a population of about 7,000 residents in 2010. It is the northernmost major settlement within the United Kingdom.

Centred off the north coast of the Scottish mainland and on the east coast of the Shetland Mainland, Lerwick lies north-by-northeast of Aberdeen; west of the similarly sheltered port of Bergen in Norway; and south east of Tórshavn in the Faroe Islands. One of the UK&#x27;s coastal weather stations is situated there, with the local climate having small seasonal variation due to the maritime influence. Being located further north than Saint Petersburg and three of the four mainland Nordic capitals, and on the same latitude as Anchorage, Alaska, Lerwick&#x27;s nights in the middle of summer only get dark twilight and winters have below six hours of complete daylight.

==History==
Lerwick is a name with roots in Old Norse and its local descendant, Norn, which was spoken in Shetland until the mid-19th century. The name &quot;Lerwick&quot; means &quot;bay of clay&quot;. The corresponding Norwegian name is , meaning clay and meaning &quot;bay&quot; or &quot;inlet&quot;. Towns with similar names exist in southwestern Norway (, ) and on the Faroe Islands (). 

Evidence of human settlement in the Lerwick area dates back to the Neolithic (4000–2500 BC) and the Bronze Age (2500–800 BC) known from paleoenvironmental records for human activity and the recovery of artefacts, including a stone axe head submerged in Bressay Sound. Iron Age (800 BC – AD 800) settlement is known at the Broch of Clickimin, which was constructed as early as 400 BC. The first settlement to be known as Lerwick was founded in the 17th century as a herring and white fish seaport to trade with the Dutch fishing fleet. This settlement was on the mainland (west) side of Bressay Sound, a natural harbour with south and north entrances between the Shetland mainland and the island of Bressay. Its collection of wooden huts was burned to the ground twice: once in the 17th century by the residents of Scalloway on the western side of Mainland, then the capital of Shetland, who disapproved of the immoral and drunken activities of the assembled fishermen and sailors; again in 1702 by the French fleet.

Fort Charlotte was built in the mid 17th century on Lerwick&#x27;s waterfront, and permanent stone-built buildings began to be erected around the fort and along the shoreline. The principal concentration of buildings was in the &quot;lanes&quot; area: a steep hillside stretching from the shoreline to Hillhead at the top. Lerwick became capital of the Shetland Islands in 1708, taking over the function from Scalloway. The civil parish of Lerwick had been in 1701 created from a small part of the parish of Tingwall, to which Scalloway still belongs. When Lerwick became more prosperous through sea trade and the fishing industry during the 19th century, the town expanded in 1891 to the west of Hillhead, thereby including the former civil parishes of Gulberwick and Quarff, as well as the islands parish of Burra. Lerwick Town Hall was built during this period of expansion.

Lerwick war memorial dates from 1923 and was designed by Sir Robert Lorimer. The next period of significant expansion was during the North Sea oil boom of the 1970s when large housing developments were built to the north of Staney Hill (located in Lerwick) and to the south (Nederdale and Sandveien).

===Provosts of Lerwick===
The Provost of Lerwick was the head of the Lerwick Town Council. Provosts were elected by the council and served not only as the chairman of that body, but as a figurehead for the entire town. They were equivalent in many ways to the institution of mayor. The council was established in 1818 and abolished in 1975, when it merged with the Zetland County Council to become the Shetland Islands Council.

==Climate==

Lerwick has recently transitioned from a subpolar oceanic climate (&quot;Cfc&quot;) to a maritime climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;, yet closely bordering on &quot;Cfc&quot;), with cool to cold temperatures all year long. The lack of trees is mostly due to man clearing the islands for grazing and agriculture thousands of years ago.

Lerwick is a very cloudy town, averaging only 1,110 sunshine hours annually. February is the coldest month, with high temperatures averaging around . In August, the warmest month, average high temperatures are . This produces an extremely narrow difference for an area north of the 60th parallel. In terms of average monthly precipitation, October to January are the year&#x27;s wettest months, with over of precipitation each month; May and June are the driest months, with average monthly precipitation less than each. Snowfall can occur, primarily from December to March, but snow accumulation is rarely heavy and usually short-lived. The exposed North Atlantic location and proximity to autumn and winter storm tracks means high winds are a regular occurrence, alongside high levels of cloudiness and precipitation. Temperatures are likely to be slightly milder in the town centre at sea level, as the weather station is at an elevation of .

Owing to its northerly location, winter months are extremely dark in Lerwick. On the day of the winter solstice it gets only 5 hours and 49 minutes of daylight. In sharp contrast daylight lasts 18 hours and 55 minutes on the day of the summer solstice. As a result, nights never get completely dark for a period of time in summer, with dark blue elements remaining in the sky. The maritime influence tempers the climate effects of these swings in daylight, but in many areas of the world this latitude has hostile winters. Farther north in the world, only the Faroe Islands and a few places in Norway like Kinn have such high January averages as Lerwick and fellow Shetland station at Baltasound – with the warm Atlantic currents preventing ice formation. Only when temperatures in continental areas are record cold does Lerwick experience some cold as was the case in December 2010 during the severe cold wave affecting the British Isles and Europe that covered much of mainland UK in snow. Even so, average highs remained above and frosts were light. Mild summers are also rare with the warmest recorded month being July 2006 at an average high of .


==Demography==
Lerwick has 6,958 residents, as of 2011. It is 97.0% White (83.3% White Scottish, 8.9% White Other British, 2.6% White Other, 1.4% White Polish, 0.8% White Irish), 2.2% Asian or Asian Scottish or British Asian, and 0.8% other ethnic groups. Lerwick&#x27;s residents are 2.5% unemployed, 17.3% are part-time employees, and 50.3% are full-time employees.

==Industry and economy==
Lerwick is a busy fishing and ferry port. The harbour also services vessels supporting the offshore oil industry.

==Power supply==

Main power supply is from Lerwick Power Station located in Gremista.

==Notable buildings==

Significant buildings in Lerwick include Fort Charlotte, Lerwick Town Hall, the Böd of Gremista, Shetland Museum and Broch of Clickimin.

Because of the historic nature of the area, some scenes from BBC&#x27;s &quot;Shetland&quot; were filmed in Lerwick.

==Transportation==
Lerwick is served by the Tingwall Airport located a few miles away and Sumburgh Airport that is further south and flies all year to some Scotland destinations.

NorthLink Ferries operate a daily overnight ferry service between Lerwick and Aberdeen, regularly calling in to Kirkwall in the Orkney Islands.

The Shetland Islands Council operate a ro-ro ferry service to Out Skerries and Bressay from a terminal in the centre of the town.

The local bus service is provided by the Regional Transport Partnership (ZetTrans) and operated by a number of different local bus service operators. The town has a bus station, Viking bus station.

==Schools and education==
Lerwick&#x27;s secondary school is Anderson High School.

Shetland College, a constituent partner institution of the University of the Highlands and Islands, is also based in the town, offering degree-level education (along with further education courses) to locals who may have difficulty travelling further afield to study.

==Hospitals and healthcare==
The Gilbert Bain Hospital provides secondary care services to all of Shetland. The Montfield Hospital, a few hundred metres away, is an older hospital than the Gilbert Bain, but has become a secondary health care service for the people of Lerwick over time.

==Sport==

The town is home to four football teams, Lerwick Spurs, Lerwick Thistle, Lerwick Celtic and Lerwick Rangers. The Clickimin Leisure Complex provides sports facilities for the town such as a swimming pool and open court.

==Media==
Television signals are received from the Bressay TV transmitter. Local independent radio station SIBC broadcasts daily from a studio in Market Street. BBC Radio Shetland, a BBC Radio Scotland regional opt out, has its studios in Pitt Lane. &quot;The Shetland Times&quot;, a weekly local newspaper, has its premises in Gremista on the northern outskirts of Lerwick. Millgaet Media Group, a multi-media production company, is based at the North Ness Business Park.

==Culture==
Lerwick has strong ties with Scandinavian countries, particularly Norway (Lerwick has a friendship agreement with Måløy in Norway).

==Events==
Lerwick is the focus of most events in Shetland, including the largest of the annual Up Helly Aa fire festivals which takes place on the last Tuesday of January every year.

==Places of worship==
There are several churches in Lerwick, including:
* Adam Clarke Memorial Methodist Church (a congregation of the Methodist Church of Great Britain).
* Baptist Church, Clairmont Place.
* St. Columba&#x27;s Church – one of three buildings of Lerwick and Bressay Parish Church (part of the Church of Scotland).
* St. Magnus&#x27; Church, Greenfield Place (part of the Scottish Episcopal Church).
* St. Margaret&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church.

In the 19th century there were more churches in Lerwick, including a Free Church on South Hill Head.

While there is not currently a Muslim place of worship in Lerwick, there are plans to refurbish the old Lochside Stores building into a mosque.

<doc id="324817" wikidata="Q1767161" url="?curid=324817" title="Chamaeleo">
<text>Chamaeleo is a genus of chameleons in the family Chamaeleonidae. Most species of the genus &quot;Chamaeleo&quot; are found in sub-Saharan Africa, but a few species are also present in northern Africa, southern Europe, and southern Asia east to India and Sri Lanka.

==Description==
Species in the genus &quot;Chamaeleo&quot; are slow moving, with independently movable eyes, the ability to change skin colouration, a long tongue, usually a prehensile tail, and special leg adaptations for grasping vegetation. Males are generally larger and more colorful than females. Almost all species have a maximum snout-vent length (SVL) between .

==Behavior==
The vast majority of &quot;Chamaeleo&quot; species are arboreal and typically found in trees or bushes, but a few species (notably the Namaqua Chameleon) are partially or largely terrestrial.

==Reproduction==
The genus &quot;Chamaeleo&quot; includes only oviparous species.

==In captivity==
With few exceptions, the chameleons most commonly seen in captivity are all members of the genus &quot;Chamaeleo&quot;; the most commonly found species in the pet trade (as well as through captive breeders) include the common, Senegal, and veiled chameleons, but all chameleons tend to require special care, and are generally suited to the intermediate or advanced reptile keeper.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Chamaeleo&quot; is the type genus of the family Chamaeleonidae.

All other genera of &quot;traditional chameleons&quot; in the subfamily Chamaeleoninae (&quot;Archaius&quot;, &quot;Bradypodion&quot;, &quot;Calumma&quot;, &quot;Furcifer&quot;, &quot;Kinyongia&quot;, &quot;Nadzikambia&quot;, and &quot;Trioceros&quot;) have at some point been included in the genus &quot;Chamaeleo&quot;, but are now regarded as separate genera by virtually all authorities.

==Extant species==
14 species are recognized as being valid, and subspecies are recognized for some species.

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority or trinomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species or subspecies was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Chamaeleo&quot;.

<doc id="324818" wikidata="Q1382726" url="?curid=324818" title="South Downs Way">
<text>The South Downs Way is a long distance footpath and bridleway running along the South Downs in southern England. It is one of 16 National Trails in England and Wales. The trail runs for from Winchester in Hampshire to Eastbourne in East Sussex, with about of ascent and descent.

==History==
People have been using the paths and tracks that have been linked to form the South Downs Way for approximately 8000 years. They were a safer and drier alternative to those in the wetter lowlands throughout the mesolithic era. Early occupation in the area began 2000 years after that in the neolithic era. Early inhabitants built tumuli in places on the hills and hill forts later, once tribal fighting became more common. Old Winchester Hill is an example of one of these hill forts along the path. The trail was probably used by the Romans, despite the fact that they built one of their roads across the path at Stane Street (Chichester), this use possibly evidenced by the existence of Bignor Roman Villa near Bury, nearby the path.

The South Downs Way was approved as a National Trail in March 1963 and opened in July 1972. It was the UK&#x27;s fifth national trail to be established and its first long-distance bridleway. It initially ran almost entirely in Sussex, from Buriton, on the Hampshire–Sussex border, to Beachy Head, near Eastbourne. In 1987 it was decided to extend the route westwards through Hampshire to Winchester.

Of medieval historical interest, the village of Lomer, now only visible as a few small bumps in the ground, was most likely abandoned during the plague in the 14th century. The flat plain to the north of the South Downs Way, where it passes Lewes, is the site of the Battle of Lewes fought by Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester and Henry III during the Second Barons&#x27; War.

Ditchling Beacon probably due to its height, had for centuries been used to warn local inhabitants of pending invasion. Again during the Tudor period the beacon was utilized to warn Queen Elizabeth I of the Spanish Armada which could be seen coming up the channel.

One particular oddity, The Long Man of Wilmington, can be found only a few metres off the path and down the hill as the path nears one end in Eastbourne. Recent study has shown that it was most likely created in the sixteenth or seventeenth century AD possibly posing more questions than it answers regarding its meaning. Yet still it attracts its fair share of Neo-Druidism and other pagan interest with rituals and festival held there commonly.

During the Second World War much of the south coast of England was fortified with pillboxes, tank obstacles and machine gun posts in anticipation of a Nazi invasion, the plan for which was known to the Nazis as Operation Sealion. These objects can be seen closer to the sea and require a diversion. The closest is Newhaven Fort, a 5-mile diversion from the path, which is an attraction that houses many World War II artefacts and documents with examples of the huge cannons used in coastal defence.

The South Downs Way celebrated 50 years since opening by fixing commemorative plaques to signposts along the way in all 66 parishes that the path runs through.

==Route==
The undulating path begins in Winchester Hampshire, and passes Cheesefoot Head, the towns of Petersfield and Arundel, the villages of Storrington and Steyning, Devil&#x27;s Dyke viewpoint near Brighton, followed by Ditchling Beacon and miles of chalk downland across to Beachy Head, and ending in Eastbourne, East Sussex. The trail is popular with walkers, including day walkers, overnighters, and through hikers.

Several youth hostels are along the route to accommodate walkers. It also passes Birling Gap, a beach area with hotel and restaurant.

Most of the route is on bridleways, permitting access for walkers, cyclists and horse riders. Occasional short sections are on roads or byways, and these are the only parts on which motor vehicles are permitted. Some sections are on footpath, and in these places an alternative signed route via road or bridleway is provided for cyclists. The footpath sections are mostly short, but between Alfriston and Eastbourne there is an extended footpath section including the Seven Sisters cliffs, for which the bridleway alternative is several miles inland.

==Geography==
The South Downs Way lies within the South Downs National Park, mostly on high chalk downland of the Hampshire Downs and the South Downs. The easternmost section is on the high chalk cliffs of the Seven Sisters, Sussex. Apart from at the end points, the way keeps to relatively isolated rural areas and some villages, although it passes within a few miles of Brighton and Lewes.

==Endurance events==
Various running and cycling events are held along the route; including the British Heart Foundation&#x27;s annual randonée. Part or all of the 100 miles is cycled to raise funds for heart disease research, the fastest times are sub 8 hours with most riders taking under 14 hours.

Part of the South Downs Way is used for Oxfam&#x27;s Trailwalker, the UK&#x27;s &#x27;toughest team charity challenge&#x27;. It is a non-stop 100 km endurance event along the South Downs Way to raise money for Oxfam and the Gurkha Welfare Trust.

Around 93% of the full 100 miles is run non-stop on foot as part of the &#x27;Centurion South Downs Way 100&#x27;; course records are held by (male) Mark Perkins 14 hrs 3 mins, and (female) Jean Beaumont 16 hrs 56 mins.

==Connecting paths==
===International routes===
For much of its length the South Downs Way forms part of the route of the E9 European Coastal Path which runs for 3,125 miles (5,000 km) from Cabo de São Vicente in south-west Portugal to Narva-Jõesuu in north-east Estonia, near the border with Russia.

The route runs through Portugal, Spain and France before crossing the English Channel by ferry from the French port of Roscoff to Plymouth. From Plymouth the route of the E9 follows the South West Coast Path, Bournemouth Coast Path, the Solent Way (with an Isle of Wight option) where it meets the South Downs Way at the Queen Elizabeth Country Park near Buriton. From Jevington the E9 route leaves the South Downs Way and follows the 1066 Country Walk and Saxon Shore Way to Dover, from where it returns to France. It then continues to Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.

As a National Trail, the South Downs Way is also part of the network of routes that form the International Appalachian Trail.

Additionally, &quot;F. pardalis&quot; has been introduced to Réunion, Mauritius and Florida, while &quot;F. oustaleti&quot; has been introduced to Kenya and Florida.

==Taxonomy==
The generic name () is derived from the Latin root meaning &quot;forked&quot; and refers to the shape of the animal&#x27;s feet.

The genus contains 24 species.

==Species==
The following species are recognized as being valid.

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Furcifer&quot;.

<text>The Muldentalkreis () is a former district in Saxony, Germany. It was bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts 
Delitzsch, Torgau-Oschatz, Döbeln, Mittweida and Leipziger Land.

== History ==
The roots of the district date back to the &quot;Amt Grimma&quot;, which was formed in 1832 to 1838, and was later renamed &quot;Kreis&quot; (district). The city of Wurzen left the district 1926–1945 as a district-free city. In 1952 the area around Wurzen was split off from the district Grimma. This was reverted in 1994 when the two previous districts Grimma and Wurzen were merged again. A few municipalities from other districts around Bad Lausick were added as well. In August 2008, it became a part of the new district of Leipzig.

== Geography ==
The district is named after its major river, the &quot;Mulde&quot; – the name &quot;Muldental&quot; means &quot;valley of the Mulde&quot;. The Mulde is formed in the south of the district by its two confluents &quot;Freiberger Mulde&quot; and &quot;Zwickauer Mulde&quot;, and flows through the district in south-north direction.

<text>Brookesia is a genus of chameleons, lizards in the family Chamaeleonidae. The genus is endemic to Madagascar. Member species range from small to very small in size, and are known collectively as leaf chameleons (though this common name is also used for species in the genera &quot;Rieppeleon&quot; and &quot;Rhampholeon&quot;). &quot;Brookesia&quot; includes species considered to be the world&#x27;s smallest chameleons, and are also among the smallest reptiles. Members of the genus &quot;Brookesia&quot; are largely brown, and most are essentially terrestrial. 

A significant percentage of the species in the genus were only identified to science within the last three decades, and a number of species that still have not received a scientific name are known to exist. Most inhabit very small ranges in areas that are difficult to access, and due to their small size and secretive nature, they have been relatively poorly studied compared to their larger relatives.

&quot;Brookesia&quot; are abundant in low-disturbance riparian zones and low-disturbance rainforests. &quot;Brookesia&quot; are scarce in high-disturbance forests recovering from burning. As of 2024, &quot;Brookesia nofy&quot; is the most recently described new species in the subfamily Brookesiinae. A different species, &quot;B. nana&quot;, is the first chameleon known not to change colors.

==Etymology==
The generic name &quot;Brookesia&quot; is in honor of British naturalist Joshua Brookes.

==Conservation status==
Most &quot;Brookesia&quot; are on CITES Appendix II, the only exception being &quot;B. perarmata&quot; on Appendix I (a species also listed as endangered and a newly discovered &quot;Brookesia nana&quot; listed as Critically Endangered by IUCN). Consequently, a special permit is required to import any of the below species from their native Madagascar, and typically no permit is issued for &quot;B. perarmata&quot;.

==Species==

<text>Rhampholeon (from , &#x27;bird&#x27;s bill&#x27; and , &#x27;lion&#x27;) is a genus of small chameleons, commonly known as pygmy chameleons or African leaf chameleons, found in East Africa and Central Africa. They are found in forests, woodlands, thickets, and savanna, and most species are restricted to highlands. They are brown, grey, or green, and typically seen at low levels in bushes, or on the ground among grasses or leaf litter.

==Species==
The following 25 species are recognized as being valid:

<doc id="324828" wikidata="Q4913755" url="?curid=324828" title="Bimonster group">
<text>In mathematics, the bimonster is a group that is the wreath product of the monster group &quot;M&quot; with Z2:

:formula_1

The Bimonster is also a quotient of the Coxeter group corresponding to the Dynkin diagram &quot;Y&quot;555, a Y-shaped graph with 16 nodes:

Actually, the 3 outermost nodes are redundant. This is because the subgroup &quot;Y&quot;124 is the E8 Coxeter group. It generates the remaining node of &quot;Y&quot;125. This pattern extends all the way to &quot;Y&quot;444: it automatically generates the 3 extra nodes of &quot;Y&quot;555.

John H. Conway conjectured that a presentation of the bimonster could be given by adding a certain extra relation to the presentation defined by the &quot;Y&quot;444 diagram. More specifically, the affine E6 Coxeter group is formula_2, which can be reduced to the finite group formula_3 by adding a single relation called the &quot;spider relation&quot;. Once this relation is added, and the diagram is extended to &quot;Y&quot;444, the group generated is the bimonster. This was proved in 1990 by Simon P. Norton; the proof was simplified in 1999 by A. A. Ivanov.

== Other Y-groups ==
Many subgroups of the (bi)monster can be defined by adjoining the spider relation to smaller Coxeter diagrams, most notably the Fischer groups and the baby monster group. The groups &quot;Y&quot;ij0, &quot;Y&quot;ij1, &quot;Y&quot;122, &quot;Y&quot;123, and &quot;Y&quot;124 are finite even without adjoining additional relations. They are the Coxeter groups &quot;A&quot;i+j+1, &quot;D&quot;i+j, &quot;E&quot;6, &quot;E&quot;7, and &quot;E&quot;8, respectively. Other groups, which would be infinite without the spider relation, are summarized below:

<text>Frederick John Nile (born 15 September 1934) is an Australian former politician and ordained Christian minister. Nile was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council from 1981-2023, except for a period in 2004. Nile was re-elected at the 1991, 1999, 2007, and 2015 state elections and served as the Assistant President of the Legislative Council between 2007 and 2019. Nile lost his seat at the 2023 New South Wales state election, after four decades of being in parliament.

Nile was National President of the Christian Democratic Party, a conservative party which focused primarily on what it regarded as important moral and social issues. Nile is noted for his controversial comments. He is mainly known for his vocal opposition to drug use, abortion, pornography and homosexuality. He is patron of the Australian Christian Nation Association and Vice President of the Australian Christian Endeavour Union, an evangelical youth movement. Until his recent electoral defeat, Nile was the longest-serving member of the New South Wales Parliament.

==Early life==
Nile was born in Kings Cross, New South Wales and was educated at Mascot Public and Cleveland Street High School (1940–1949). In 1952, during the Korean War, at age 17, Nile volunteered to join the National Service in 1952 and then transferred to the CMF/reserves which allowed him to avoid deployment to Korea and qualified for the rank of major, before retiring in 1972. In 1958, Nile married Elaine Crealy, who was a member of the Legislative Council for 14 years. They had three sons and a daughter. Elaine died in October 2011 at age 75. Nile attended the NSW Congregational Theological College, the NSW United Faculty of Theology and the University of New England. He was awarded a Licentiate of Theology by the Melbourne College of Divinity. 

==Early career==
Nile was ordained as a Congregational minister in 1964. From 1964 to 1967, he was National Director of the Australian Christian Endeavour Movement, a Protestant youth leadership training organisation. In 1967–68, he was assistant director of the Billy Graham Crusade in Sydney before being employed as director of the Congregational Board of Evangelism in New South Wales. In 1970–71, he was involved in social work as director of the Methodist Mission to the People of New South Wales and, from 1971 to 1973, was Director of Outreach and Evangelism, Sydney City Wesley Central Methodist Mission.

In 1974, Nile was elected national co-ordinator and the New South Wales director of the Australian Federation of Festival of Light – Community Standards Organisation (FOL–CSO), an organisation which campaigned &quot;for purity, love and family life&quot;.

==Political career==

Nile was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Council on 19 September 1981 with 9.1% of the vote as the founder of the Call to Australia (Fred Nile) Group, established in 1977. Following the election to the Legislative Council of Jim Cameron (in 1984) and Nile&#x27;s wife, Elaine (1988), the Call to Australia Group was officially recognised as a political party. Fred Nile was re-elected to the Council at the 1991 and 1999 state elections. Nile wrote his autobiography in 2001. In 2003, Nile resigned from the Uniting Church in Australia claiming that the church had &quot;officially decided to part with a literal interpretation of the Judeo-Christian Bible&quot;.

===Federal candidacy (2004)===
Nile resigned from the NSW Parliament on 30 August 2004 in order to contest the 2004 Federal election, seeking a position in the Australian Senate on a platform of opposition of the recognition of gay marriages. Nile was the last candidate excluded after the distribution of votes on the 77th count, and was not elected to the Senate. A few months later, he was re-appointed to the Legislative Council to fill the vacancy created by his own resignation.

===Return to state politics===
At the 2007 New South Wales state election, Nile was re-elected for a further eight-year term and was appointed to the newly created position of Assistant President of the NSW Legislative Council.

In 2007, he retired as the New South Wales director of the Australian Federation of Festival of Light. Nile served as the President of the Fellowship of Congregational Churches, a group of Australian Congregationalists who declined to join the Uniting Church in 1977, for the years 2007 to 2012, and again for the 2013/14 year.

In November 2009, he stated his decision to retire in 2015, but later announced his decision to accept the Christian Democratic Party (CDP) nomination for the NSW Legislative Council at the New South Wales State Election on 28 March 2015. In 2014, Nile announced that he will be contesting the next state election in 2015 with his deputy, Ross Clifford. In 2015, Nile supported the Liberal government&#x27;s Privatization of the state&#x27;s electricity poles and wires.

In January 2017, Nile was denied entry to the United States, where he had been invited to attend the inauguration of Donald Trump. He was later granted a visa and an apology, though no reason was given for the initial refusal.

===Demise of the Christian Democratic Party and Aftermath: 2021– ===
In April 2021, Nile announced he would retire in November 2021, nominating Lyle Shelton to replace him. However, in September of that year he rescinded Shelton&#x27;s endorsement and announced he would complete his term. In 2022, the Christian Democratic Party was dissolved. Following the CDP&#x27;s dissolution, Nile said he planned to form a new party called &#x27;Christ in Government (Fred Nile Alliance),&#x27; but in May 2022 he instead joined the Seniors United Party of Australia. The party was not registered with the NSW Electoral Commission and was deregistered with the AEC less than two months later. Nile renewed his retirement in October 2022, intending to give his final speech in parliament on 17 November. In February 2023, Nile announced his intention to nominate for re-election. Nile appeared on the ballot second to his wife Silvana with no party affiliation as Group G. Having only two candidates, this group had no above-the-line voting square which experts considered to leave no prospect for election.
In the event, Fred and Silvana Nile (Group G) both received 2507 votes in all, which constituted 0.05% of the total votes/hallot papers cast. which was not enough to return Nile to the Legislative Council with his wife 

==Controversies==
===Comments on &quot;Pederasty&quot; ABC program===
In July 1975, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s Radio National aired a program entitled &quot;Pederasty&quot; which featured Richard Neville candidly interviewing &quot;three men in their thirties who admitted to sex relations with boys, and a teenage boy who said he had been involved in such relationships since he was 12&quot;. Nile objected to the program&#x27;s content and turned a tape of the show over to police. 

===Comments on the Lindt Cafe siege===
In January 2015, Nile argued that male hostages who fled the Lindt Cafe siege should not receive bravery awards, as giving them one would &quot;cheapen&quot; it. He stated during an interview on Channel Seven&#x27;s &quot;Sunrise&quot; program that no hostages at Martin Place should receive bravery awards and their actions had potentially risked the lives of their fellow hostages. &quot;Usually men try to protect the women and it seems that the men were saving their own skin and leaving the women there.&quot; He later added that he mis-spoke when he said that &quot;the only man inside the café had been the man holding the gun.&quot;

In a media release dated 14 January 2015, Nile stated, &quot;I fully support Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s recommendation to the Governor General, Sir Peter Cosgrove, that Mrs Dawson and Mr Johnson should be honoured with posthumous bravery awards.&quot; He also recommended that proper consideration should be given to the actions of others involved, including other hostages and police.

===Comments on homosexuality===
Nile has been described by Buzzfeed as &quot;one of Australia&#x27;s longest-running anti-gay campaigners&quot;. He is opposed to homosexuality which he has described as a &quot;mental disorder&quot; and calls homosexuality a &quot;lifestyle choice&quot; that is &quot;immoral, unnatural and abnormal&quot;. Nile has also stated that he was &quot;totally opposed to the bashing of homosexuals ... totally opposed to any violence or attacks directed against homosexual men or lesbians ... opposed to strong (malicious) verbal attacks.&quot;

Nile has opposed the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, which he described as a &quot;public parade of immorality and blasphemy&quot;. Nile objected to the &quot;indecency and obscenity in various parts of the Mardi Gras&quot; and stated that it reinforced &quot;the worst stereotypes&quot;. Each year, he leads a prayer session against the event.

In 2005, Nile called for the repealing of New South Wales anti-vilification law, claiming that the law is discriminatory and should either cover all citizens or be abolished. Nile claimed that the Homosexual Vilification Act was being abused to gag free speech and prevent open non-malicious public discussion.

Following a 2011 announcement by Penny Wong, a Labor Party federal government minister, that her same-sex partner was pregnant, Nile publicly denounced Wong&#x27;s actions, saying &quot;I&#x27;m totally against a baby being brought up by two mothers&quot; and &quot;She needn&#x27;t have made it public. It just promotes their lesbian lifestyle and trying to make it natural where it&#x27;s unnatural.&quot; During a televised debate on the show &quot;Q&amp;A&quot;, Nile told Gene Robinson, the first priest in an openly gay relationship to be consecrated a bishop in a major Christian denomination, that he &quot;should be ashamed to be a bishop and going against the church&quot;.

Nile used his newspaper, &quot;Family World News&quot;, to urge a no vote on the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey.

===Comments on the Australian Greens===
Nile is a frequent critic of the Australian Greens, claiming that they have exploited genuine concern for the environment to garner political influence to &quot;push their agenda of social engineering&quot;. Nile has criticised the Greens for what he calls &quot;duplicite political expediency&quot;, citing their push to legalise and fund &quot;illicit drug habits for addicts&quot; such as heroin and cannabis in what he claims is contravention of publicised Greens policy. Nile has also labelled the Greens as being &quot;anti-family&quot;, &quot;anti-Christian&quot;, and &quot;pagan&quot;, citing what he believes to be pro-pornography and pro-sex industry policies and their opposition to the current practice of opening parliament with daily prayers.

Nile once described the Greens as the &quot;watermelon party – green on the outside but red on the inside, with a bit of a pink tinge.&quot;

===Comments on Muslims and neo-pagans===

Following the Moscow theatre hostage crisis in 2002, Nile asked whether the then state minister of police would consider banning full body coverings, like those worn by the Chechen terrorists, from parliament and places of public gathering to prevent the carriage of weapons or explosive devices. Nile has attempted to pass bills in the NSW Legislative Council that would prohibit the wearing of full-face coverings, such as the hijab or niqāb, six times – 2006, 2010, 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2019. Five of the bills failed to be passed, with only the latest bill still not lapsed.

On 10 March 2007, Nile raised concern that Australian embassy officials posted in Islamic nations were favouring the immigration of Muslim over Christian refugees. Nile called for a moratorium on Muslim immigration to Australia: &quot;Australians deserve a breathing space so the situation can be carefully assessed&quot;, he told an audience in North Ryde.

In 2010, Nile asked for the removal of the then Australian Muslim leader Sheik Taj El-Din Hilaly after the sheik placed the blame for sexual assault on the female victims.

Nile is opposed to Australian neopagans, having said that the Christian Democrats would &quot;do what it can to stop pagan weddings and witchcraft or Wicca activities.&quot;

===Comparison of ethics classes to Nazism===
Ethics classes were introduced by the Keneally Labor government as an alternative for children who did not want to attend traditional scripture classes. Prior to the 2011 state election, Barry O&#x27;Farrell made a pre-election pledge of not scrapping the ethics classes. Following the election, Nile, who was vehemently opposed to the ethics classes, introduced a private members bill proposing the abolition of the classes at the end of the 2011 calendar year. Debate on the bill was adjourned until 16 September; and eventually Nile was successful in pushing the government to establish a parliamentary inquiry to examine whether ethics classes in NSW schools should be abolished. Meanwhile, in introducing his bill into the Legislative Council, Nile gained headlines by arguing that the ethics course is based on a philosophy linked to Nazism and Communism.

==Parliament activities==
Nile served on the New South Wales&#x27; Parliamentary Standing Committee on Social Issues (1988–1995), facilitating legislative reforms on adoption laws, drug abuse among youth, rape rates and pornography, domestic violence, youth violence, youth rural suicides, compensation for medically acquired AIDS/HIV victims, juvenile justice, births, deaths and marriage records.

From 2007 to 2019, Nile served as the Assistant President of the New South Wales Legislative Council.

Nile also served on the New South Wales&#x27; Parliamentary Standing Committee on Law and Justice, the New South Wales&#x27; Joint Parliamentary Select Committee on Electoral Reform, the Parliamentary Select Committee into Firearms, the Joint Parliamentary Select Committee into the Management of Parliament, as Chairman of the Cross City Tunnel Inquiry, Chairman of the General Purpose Standing Committee No. 1, Chairman of the Select Committee on Electoral and Political Party Funding and Chairman of the Joint Select Committee on the Royal North Shore Hospital among many others. Until his recent defeat as a Legislative Council candidate, Fred Nile served as a member of the Standing Committee on Social Issues.

<doc id="324834" wikidata="Q847482" url="?curid=324834" title="HeLa">
<text>HeLa () is an immortalized cell line used in scientific research. It is the oldest human cell line and one of the most commonly used. HeLa cells are durable and prolific, allowing for extensive applications in scientific study. The line is derived from cervical cancer cells taken on February 8, 1951, from Henrietta Lacks, a 31-year-old African American mother of five, after whom the line is named. Lacks died of cancer on October 4, 1951. 

The cells from Lacks&#x27;s cancerous cervical tumor were taken without her knowledge, which was common practice in the United States at the time. Cell biologist George Otto Gey found that they could be kept alive, and developed a cell line. Previously, cells cultured from other human cells would survive for only a few days, but cells from Lacks&#x27;s tumor behaved differently.

==History==
===Origin===
In 1951, Henrietta Lacks was admitted to the Johns Hopkins Hospital with symptoms of irregular vaginal bleeding; she was subsequently treated for cervical cancer. Her first treatment was performed by Lawrence Wharton Jr., who at that time collected tissue samples from her cervix without her consent. Her cervical biopsy supplied samples of tissue for clinical evaluation and research by George Otto Gey, head of the Tissue Culture Laboratory. Gey&#x27;s lab assistant Mary Kubicek used the roller-tube technique to culture the cells. It was observed that the cells grew robustly, doubling every 20–24 hours, unlike previous specimens, which died out.

The cells were propagated by Gey shortly before Lacks died of her cancer in 1951. This was the first human cell line to prove successful in vitro, which was a scientific achievement with profound future benefit to medical research. Gey freely donated these cells, along with the tools and processes that his lab developed, to any scientist requesting them, simply for the benefit of science. Neither Lacks nor her family gave permission to harvest the cells. The cells were later commercialized, although never patented in their original form. There was no requirement at that time to inform patients or their relatives about such matters, because discarded material or material obtained during surgery, diagnosis, or therapy was considered the property of the physician or the medical institution.

As was customary for Gey&#x27;s lab assistant, the culture was named after the first two letters of Henrietta Lacks&#x27; first and last names, He + La. Before a 1973 query printed in the journal &quot;Nature&quot; obtained her real name, the &quot;HeLa&quot; cell line was incorrectly attributed to a &quot;Helen Lane&quot; or &quot;Helen Larson&quot;. The origin of this obfuscation is unclear.

In 1973, staff at Johns Hopkins discovered that HeLa cells could travel through the air and easily contaminate other cell cultures. When staff at Johns Hopkins realized this, a staff physician contacted the Lacks family and sought DNA samples to help identify which non-HeLa cultures were contaminated with HeLa cells. The family never understood the purpose of the visit, but they were distressed by their understanding of what the researchers told them. These cells are treated as cancer cells, as they are descended from a biopsy taken from a visible lesion on the cervix as part of Lacks&#x27;s diagnosis of cancer.

HeLa cells, like other cell lines, are termed &quot;immortal&quot; because they can divide an unlimited number of times in a laboratory cell culture plate, as long as fundamental cell survival conditions are met (i.e. being maintained and sustained in a suitable environment). There are many strains of HeLa cells, because they mutate during division in cell cultures, but all HeLa cells are descended from the same tumor cells removed from Lacks. The total number of HeLa cells that have been propagated in cell culture far exceeds the total number of cells that were in Henrietta Lacks&#x27;s body.

===Controversy===

Lacks&#x27;s case is one of many examples of the lack of informed consent in 20th-century medicine. Communication between tissue donors and doctors was virtually nonexistentcells were taken without patient consent, and patients were not told what the cells would be used for. Johns Hopkins Hospital, where Lacks received treatment and had her tissue harvested, was the only hospital in the Baltimore area where African American patients could receive free care. The patients who received free care from this segregated sect of the hospital often became research subjects without their knowledge. Lacks&#x27;s family also had no access to her patient files and had no say in who received HeLa cells or what they would be used for. Additionally, as HeLa cells were popularized and used more frequently throughout the scientific community, Lacks&#x27;s relatives received no financial benefit and continued to live with limited access to healthcare.

This issue of who owns tissue samples taken for research was brought up in the Supreme Court of California case of &quot;Moore v. Regents of the University of California&quot; in 1990. The court ruled that a person&#x27;s discarded tissue and cells are not his or her property and can be commercialized.

Lacks&#x27;s case influenced the establishment of the Common Rule in 1991. The Common Rule enforces informed consent by ensuring that doctors inform patients if they plan to use any details of the patient&#x27;s case in research and give them the choice of disclosing the details or not. Tissues connected to their donors&#x27; names are also strictly regulated under this rule, and samples are no longer named using donors&#x27; initials, but rather by code numbers. To further resolve the issue of patient privacy, Johns Hopkins established a joint committee with the NIH and several of Lacks&#x27;s family members to determine who receives access to Henrietta Lacks&#x27;s genome.

In 2021, Henrietta Lacks&#x27;s estate sued to get past and future payments for the alleged unauthorized and widely known sale of HeLa cells by Thermo Fisher Scientific. Lacks&#x27;s family hired an attorney to seek compensation from upwards of 100 pharmaceutical companies that have used and profited from HeLa cells. Settlement of the suit with Thermo Fisher Scientific was announced in August 2023, with undisclosed terms. Subsequently the Lacks family announced that it will be suing the company Ultragenyx next.

==Use in research==
HeLa cells were the first human cells to be successfully cloned in 1953, by Theodore Puck and Philip I. Marcus at the University of Colorado, Denver. Since then, HeLa cells have &quot;continually been used for research into cancer, AIDS, the effects of radiation and toxic substances, gene mapping, and countless other scientific pursuits.&quot; According to author Rebecca Skloot, by 2009, &quot;more than 60,000 scientific articles had been published about research done on HeLa [cells], and that number was increasing steadily at a rate of more than 300 papers each month.&quot;

=== Polio eradication ===
HeLa cells were used by Jonas Salk to test the first polio vaccine in the 1950s. They were observed to be easily infected by the poliomyelitis virus, causing infected cells to die. This made HeLa cells highly desirable for polio vaccine testing, since results could be easily obtained. A large volume of HeLa cells were needed for the testing of Salk&#x27;s polio vaccine, prompting the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (NFIP) to find a facility capable of mass-producing HeLa cells. In the spring of 1953, a cell culture factory was established at Tuskegee University to supply Salk and other labs with HeLa cells. Less than a year later, Salk&#x27;s vaccine was ready for human trials.

=== Virology ===
HeLa cells have been used in testing how parvovirus infects cells of humans, dogs, and cats. These cells have also been used to study viruses such as the oropouche virus (OROV). OROV causes disruption of cells in culture; the cells start to degenerate shortly after they are infected, causing viral induction of apoptosis. HeLa cells have been used to study expression of the papillomavirus E2 and apoptosis. HeLa cells have also been used to study the ability of the canine distemper virus to induce apoptosis in cancer cell lines, which could play an important role in developing treatments for tumor cells resistant to radiation and chemotherapy.

HeLa cells have also been instrumental in the development of human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines. In the 1980s, Harald zur Hausen found that Lacks&#x27;s cells from the original biopsy contained HPV-18, which was later found to be the cause of the aggressive cancer that had killed her. His work in linking HPV with cervical cancer won him a Nobel Prize and led to the development of HPV vaccines, which are predicted to reduce the number of deaths from cervical cancer by 70%.

Over the years, HeLa cells have been infected with various types of viruses, including HIV, Zika, mumps, and herpes viruses to test and develop new vaccines and drugs. Dr. Richard Axel discovered that the addition of the CD4 protein to HeLa cells enabled them to be infected with HIV, allowing the virus to be studied. In 1979, scientists learned that the measles virus constantly mutates when it infects HeLa cells, and in 2019 they found that Zika cannot multiply in HeLa cells.

=== Cancer ===
HeLa cells have been used in a number of cancer studies, including those involving sex steroid hormones, such as estradiol and estrogen, and estrogen receptors, along with estrogen-like compounds, such as quercetin, which has cancer-reducing properties. There have also been studies on HeLa cells, involving the effects of flavonoids and antioxidants with estradiol on cancer cell proliferation.

In 2011, HeLa cells were used in tests of novel heptamethine dyes IR-808 and other analogues, which are currently being explored for their unique uses in medical diagnostics, the individualized treatment of cancer patients with the aid of PDT, co-administration with other drugs, and irradiation. HeLa cells have been used in research involving fullerenes to induce apoptosis as a part of photodynamic therapy, as well as in &quot;in vitro&quot; cancer research using cell lines. HeLa cells have also been used to define cancer markers in RNA, and have been used to establish an RNAi Based Identification System and Interference of Specific Cancer Cells.

In 2014, HeLa cells were shown to provide a viable cell line for tumor xenografts in C57BL/6 nude mice, and were subsequently used to examine the &quot;in vivo&quot; effects of fluoxetine and cisplatin on cervical cancer.

=== Genetics ===
In 1953, a lab mistake involving mixing HeLa cells with the wrong liquid allowed researchers for the first time to see and count each chromosome clearly in the HeLa cells with which they were working. This accidental discovery led scientists Joe Hin Tjio and Albert Levan to develop better techniques for staining and counting chromosomes. They were the first to show that humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes rather than 24, as was previously believed. This was important for the study of developmental disorders, such as Down syndrome, that involve the number of chromosomes.

In 1965, Henry Harris and John Watkins created the first human-animal hybrid by fusing HeLa cells with mouse embryo cells. This enabled advances in mapping genes to specific chromosomes, which would eventually lead to the Human Genome Project.

=== Space Biology===
In the 1960s, HeLa cells were sent on one of the early satellite missions to determine the long term effects of space travel on living cells and tissues. Scientists discovered that HeLa cells divide more quickly in zero gravity.

== Analysis ==

===Telomerase===
The HeLa cell line was derived for use in cancer research. These cells proliferate abnormally rapidly, even compared with other cancer cells. Like many other cancer cells, HeLa cells have an active version of telomerase during cell division, which copies telomeres over and over again. This prevents the incremental shortening of telomeres that is implicated in aging and eventual cell death. In this way, the cells circumvent the Hayflick limit, which is the limited number of cell divisions that most normal cells can undergo before becoming senescent. This results in unlimited cell division and immortality.

===Chromosome number===
Horizontal gene transfer from human papillomavirus 18 (HPV18) to human cervical cells created the HeLa genome, which is different from Henrietta Lacks&#x27;s genome in various ways, including the number of chromosomes. HeLa cells are rapidly dividing cancer cells, and the number of chromosomes varies during cancer formation and cell culture. The current estimate (excluding very tiny fragments) is a &quot;hypertriploid chromosome number (3n+)&quot;, which means 76 to 80 total chromosomes (rather than the normal diploid number of 46) with 22–25 clonally abnormal chromosomes, known as &quot;HeLa signature chromosomes&quot;. The signature chromosomes can be derived from multiple original chromosomes, making summary counts based on original numbering challenging. Researchers have also noted how stable these aberrant karyotypes can be. Studies that combined spectral karyotyping, FISH, and conventional cytogenic techniques have shown that the detected chromosomal aberrations may be representative of advanced cervical carcinomas and were probably present in the primary tumor, since the HeLa genome has remained stable, even after years of continued cultivation.

===Complete genome sequence===
The complete genome of HeLa cells was sequenced and published on 11 March 2013, without the Lacks family&#x27;s knowledge. Concerns were raised by the family, so the authors voluntarily withheld access to the sequence data. Jay Shendure led a HeLa sequencing project at the University of Washington, which resulted in a paper that had been accepted for publication in March 2013 – but that was also put on hold while the Lacks family&#x27;s privacy concerns were addressed. On 7 August 2013, NIH director Francis Collins announced a policy of controlled access to the cell line genome, based on an agreement reached after three meetings with the Lacks family. A data-access committee will review requests from researchers for access to the genome sequence, under the criteria that the study is for medical research and that the users will abide by terms in the HeLa Genome Data Use Agreement, which includes that all NIH-funded researchers will deposit the data in a single database for future sharing. The committee consists of six members, including representatives from the medical, scientific, and bioethics fields, as well as two members of the Lacks family. In an interview, Collins praised the Lacks family&#x27;s willingness to participate in a situation that was thrust upon them. He described the whole experience with them as &quot;powerful,&quot; saying that it brought together &quot;science, scientific history and ethical concerns&quot; in a unique way.

==Contamination==
HeLa cells are sometimes difficult to control, because they adapt to growth in tissue culture plates and invade and outcompete other cell lines. Through improper maintenance, they have been known to contaminate other cell cultures in the same laboratory, interfering with biological research and forcing researchers to declare many results invalid. The degree of HeLa cell contamination among other cell types is unknown, because few researchers test the identity or purity of already established cell lines. It has been shown that a substantial fraction of &quot;in vitro&quot; cell lines are contaminated with HeLa cells; estimates range from 10% to 20%. This observation suggests that any cell line may be susceptible to a degree of contamination. Stanley Gartler (1967) and Walter Nelson-Rees (1975) were the first to publish on contamination of various cell lines by HeLa cells. Gartler noted that &quot;with the continued expansion of cell culture technology, it is almost certain that both interspecific and intraspecific contamination will occur.&quot;

HeLa cell contamination has become a pervasive worldwide problem – affecting even the laboratories of many notable physicians, scientists, and researchers, including Jonas Salk. The HeLa contamination problem also contributed to Cold War tensions. The USSR and the USA had begun to cooperate in the war on cancer launched by President Richard Nixon, only to find that the exchanged cells were contaminated by HeLa.

Rather than focus on how to resolve the problem of HeLa cell contamination, many scientists and science writers continue to document this problem as simply a contamination issue – caused not by human error or shortcomings but by the hardiness, proliferation, or overpowering nature of HeLa cells. Recent data suggest that cross-contamination is still a major problem with modern cell cultures. The International Cell Line Authentication Committee (ICLAC) notes that many cases of cell line misidentification are the result of cross-contamination of the culture by another, faster-growing cell line. This calls into question the validity of the research done using contaminated cell lines, as certain attributes of the contaminant, which may come from an entirely different species or tissue, may be misattributed to the cell line under investigation.

==New species proposal==
HeLa cells were described by evolutionary biologist Leigh Van Valen as an example of the contemporary creation of a new species, dubbed &quot;Helacyton gartleri&quot;, owing to their ability to replicate indefinitely and their non-human number of chromosomes. The species was named after geneticist Stanley M. Gartler, whom Van Valen credits with discovering &quot;the remarkable success of this species&quot;. His argument for speciation depends on these points:
*the chromosomal incompatibility of HeLa cells with human cells;
*the ecological niche of HeLa cells;
*their ability to persist and expand well beyond the desires of human cultivators;
*the possession by HeLa cells of their own clonal karyotype, defining it as a distinct species.

Van Valen proposed the new family Helacytidae and the genus &quot;Helacyton&quot;, and in the same paper proposed a new species for HeLa cells.

However, this proposal was not taken seriously by other prominent evolutionary biologists, nor by scientists in other disciplines. Van Valen&#x27;s argument that HeLa are a new species does not fulfill the criteria for an independent unicellular asexually reproducing species, because of the notorious instability of HeLa&#x27;s karyotype and their lack of a strict ancestral-descendant lineage.

<text>Éric de Montgolfier (born 11 August 1946) is a French attorney and state prosecutor (&quot;procureur de la République&quot;).

When head prosecutor in Valenciennes, he became famous for prosecuting the businessman-cum-politician Bernard Tapie for rigging the match between his football club Olympique de Marseille and the local club Valenciennes FC. Tapie was sentenced to prison in 1995 for complicity of corruption and subornation of witnesses.

In 2003, as head prosecutor of Nice, he returned to public notice with allegations that the local judiciary had deliberately derailed justice by miscarrying procedures, letting prescription lapse, or losing files, in &quot;sensitive&quot; cases; he also indicated that some members of the judiciary had unhealthy contacts in Masonic lodges with local personalities, including those they had to prosecute.

Montgolfier also opened a criminal investigation targeting rock star Johnny Hallyday for allegedly raping an employee of a yacht rented by Halliday. He had also hinted at possible investigations concerning corruption in the city of Nice&#x27;s administration.

An official report from the inspection corps of the Justice ministry blamed him for unwarranted accusations against his colleagues, but supporters of Montgolfier argue that he is criticized merely because he has uncovered cases involving well-connected people.

<text>The Brabazon Committee was a committee set up by the British government in 1942 to investigate the future needs of the British Empire&#x27;s civilian airliner market following World War II. The study was an attempt at defining, in broad overview, the impact of projected advances in aviation technology and to forecast the global needs of the post war British Empire (in South Asia, Africa, the Near and Far East) and Commonwealth (Australia, Canada, New Zealand) in the area of air transport, for passengers, mail, and cargo.

The study recognized that the British Empire and Commonwealth as both a political and economic entity would have a vital need for aviation systems (principally aircraft) to facilitate its continued existence and self-reliance in the post-war world. For military and commercial reasons, the empire simply could not continue to exist if did not understand the needs, and develop the industrial infrastructure to provide, the aviation systems and sub-systems necessary to supply and maintain a global air transport service.

==Background== 
Soon after the start of World War II, with no recorded discussion in government, a decision was taken to concentrate all efforts of the British aircraft industry on combat aircraft, and two embryo airliner projects, the Fairey FC1 and the Short S.32, were both cancelled. Subsequently, Britain had to purchase three Boeing 314 flying boats for BOAC to operate an air service between the US and the UK. It has been suggested that there was then some agreement with the United States that the US would concentrate on transport aircraft while the UK would concentrate on their heavy bombers. However, Peter Masefield was certain that such a policy was never even suggested, far less implemented. On the contrary, the action was simply to do nothing - no orders were ever placed for new British transport aircraft. It was stated in Parliament in December 1942 that &quot;the work of aircraft designers must, at the present stage of the war, be devoted wholly to war requirements&quot;. The UK was simply too busy producing military aircraft to find the capacity to build transports, and the materials required were in any case in very short supply.

When Winston Churchill attended the 1942 Moscow Conference, travelling in the freezing bomb bay of a Consolidated Liberator bomber, it brought home to him the absence of modern British airliners and the need for action with regard to transport aircraft. After discussion with Sir Stafford Cripps, the Minister of Aircraft Production, and his predecessor Lord Brabazon, he recognized that as a result of that neglect the United Kingdom was to be left at the close of the war with little experience in the design, manufacture and final assembly of transport aircraft, and no infrastructure or trained personnel for the doing of same. Yet, the massive infrastructure created in the US would allow them to produce civilian aircraft based upon military transport designs; and crucially these would have to be purchased by the UK, Empire and Commonwealth to meet their post-war civilian transport aviation needs.

In consequence, Churchill asked Lord Brabazon to form a Committee to investigate the issue and make suitable recommendations. Following this the Cabinet authorized a Second Committee to undertake more detailed work and prepare a list of requirements for each type to provide a basis for design and development.

On 24 Dec 1942, a two-part article in &quot;Flight&quot; concluded &quot;The whole British Empire at the present time has an operational fleet of transport aircraft, comprising conversions, makeshifts and cast-offs, totally inadequate to represent the Empire in serving the air routes of the world in the peace to come. Have we to rely upon other nations to do it for us? The British aircraft industry is equal to the task. The Government should decide this vital question at once.&quot;

==First Committee and Interim Report==
The first Committee under the leadership of Lord Brabazon first met on 23 December 1942 and met a further nine times between then and 9 February 1943, when it submitted its outline recommendations to the UK Cabinet in its Interim Report. This recommended the adaptation for civil use of four military types of aircraft which were then in, or near, production, and the design of five new types specifically for civil use.

The four adaptations were:

*(i) Avro York (developed from the Avro Lancaster)
*(ii) Vickers Warwick
*(iii) Short Hythe (converted from the Short Sunderland III)
*(iv) Short Sandringham (an improved conversion of the Short Sunderland V)

The five new types proposed were:

*Type I: a very large, long-range landplane for the North Atlantic route.
*Type II: an economical replacement for the Douglas DC-3 for European services.
*Type III: a four-engined, medium-range landplane for the Empire routes.
*Type IV: the most advanced of them all, a jet-propelled mailplane for the North Atlantic.
*Type V: a twin-engined, fourteen-passenger feederliner.

==Second Committee and Final Report==

Some weeks after the report from the First Committee, it was decided to form a Second Committee with more comprehensive and detailed terms of reference. The Second Committee began meeting on 25 May 1943 under the leadership of Lord Brabazon in order to investigate the future needs of the British civilian airliner market. The committee included members of the state-owned airlines British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and later British European Airways (BEA), and the Secretary was Peter Masefield who later became the Chief Executive of BEA. They studied a number of designs and technical considerations, meeting frequently over the next two years to further clarify the needs of different market segments, and producing 151 papers. The government contact for this committee was Sir Stafford Cripps, the Minister of Aircraft Production until May 1945 when he was succeeded by Ernest Brown. 

The views of the Committee changed considerably in that period and the list of &quot;Brabazon Types&quot; continued to vary, as did the specifications of each. One early recommendation was to pursue the &quot;Interim Types&quot; which were conversions and/or developments of wartime aircraft. The original four adaptations became:

*(i) Avro York (developed from the Avro Lancaster)
*(ii) Avro Tudor (developed from the Avro Lincoln, itself a development of the Lancaster), the Tudor I being an interim transatlantic airliner pending the introduction of the Brabazon Type I, and the Tudor II being an interim Brabazon Type III airliner with shorter range and greater capacity for the British Empire routes. 
*(iii) Handley Page Hermes, a civil development of the Halifax, first flown in 1945 but did not enter limited service with BOAC until 1950, having evolved through several iterations to be the Hermes IV. 
*(iv) Short Sandringham (an improved conversion of the Short Sunderland Mark V)

These were all produced in some numbers in due course, although the Tudor I and Tudor II never entered service. They were all too late to compete (for example) with the earlier and much more capable Douglas DC-4 which had been in service since 1942 and could carry more passengers further and faster. The final report in December 1945 ignored all these interim types and called for the construction of seven new designs which would be required after the war:

*Type I was for a very large transatlantic airliner serving the high-volume routes like London-New York, seating its passengers in luxury for the 12-hour trip. The Type I design developed into Air Ministry Specification 2/44.

*Type IIA, originally a short-haul feederliner intended to replace the Douglas DC-3, was for a piston-powered aircraft, to Air Ministry Specification 25/43, as originally intended.

*Type IIB was for an aircraft using the new turboprop engine, to Air Ministry Specification 8/46. This came about because Vickers favoured the move to turboprop power. There was some scepticism on the part of the committee, and in the end they decided to divide the specification in two, allowing the turboprop design to go ahead as Type IIB while at the same time ordering a &quot;backup&quot; piston design as the Type IIA. A parallel alternative specification 16/46 was subsequently raised to cover later changes.

*Type III called for a larger four-engined, medium-range aircraft, to Air Ministry Specification 6/45, for various multi-hop routes serving the British Empire, the &quot;Medium Range Empire&quot; (MRE) routes. This was at one time two separate requirements, IIIA and IIIB, but these had merged again in the Final Report.

*Type IV was a jet-powered, 100-seat high-speed transport, to Air Ministry Specification 22/46. This was added at the personal urging of one of the committee members, Geoffrey de Havilland, whose company was involved in development of both Britain&#x27;s first jet fighters and jet engines. The Type IV could, if the whole concept of a jet airliner could be made to work, be able to replace the Type III outright and assume many of the duties of the other planes in shorter routes.

*Type VA (initially Type V) was effectively the original Type II fourteen-passenger, feederliner aircraft to Air Ministry Specification 18/44 after the Type II had evolved into larger designs.

*Type VB was an eight-seat aircraft as a de Havilland Dragon Rapide replacement, to Air Ministry Specification 26/43, added as a further split in the Type V requirement.

The normal method for government aircraft production was that an Air Ministry Specification was issued and aircraft companies tendered designs to meet the specification. It was customary then to order prototypes of one or two designs for evaluation (though at times aircraft were ordered &quot;off the drawing board&quot;). In some cases manufacturers brought designs to the Air Ministry and a specification was written for the design. This process did not allow for companies to propose solutions which were, in their view, better, neither did it necessarily reflect the requirements of the planned operator who may have wanted something different. Additionally, other government bodies such as the Royal Aircraft Establishment had input to the process and these often conflicted with the designers being given contradictory instructions. One example of this is the trouble that Miles Aircraft had with the Ministry of Aircraft Production in relation to the design of the Miles Marathon. In 1944, the Ministry of Aircraft Production started the process for contracts for all of these planes with individual companies; this role was taken over by the newly created Ministry of Supply in 1945. The view of Sir Cyril Musgrave, the Permanent Under-Secretary in the Ministry of Supply, was that &quot;Only I can order civil airliners!&quot; This attitude was a source of considerable difficulties in this process.

==The aircraft==
*The Type I design was awarded directly to the Bristol Aeroplane Company for the Bristol Brabazon, based on submissions they had made during the war for a &quot;100 ton bomber&quot; and judging that they had the capacity. However, Miles Aircraft proposed the Miles X-11, part of the ongoing Miles M.26 development programme, but this innovative design was not seriously considered by the Ministry. One Brabazon was built and flown in 1949 with Bristol Centaurus radial engines but a planned Brabazon II with Bristol Proteus turboprop engines was not completed; the project folded in 1951 when, with BOAC having lost interest, issues with the first aircraft showed that a wing re-design was required for the Proteus.

*The Type IIA requirement was met by the Centaurus-powered Airspeed Ambassador, and 20 were ordered for BEA. The first prototype flew in July 1947, and the type entered service with BEA in March 1952. Airspeed were by then wholly owned by de Havilland, who had no interest in developing the design further, although a Dart-powered version had been proposed.

*The Type IIB requirements were initially met by the Vickers VC.2 Viceroy, and the Armstrong Whitworth A.W.55 Apollo. The Type IIB requirement was developed as the Vickers Viscount, with the Apollo failing to successfully compete with the Viscount. The production Viscount was significantly larger than the Type II proposal as BEA wanted a larger and much more capable aircraft and the Rolls-Royce Dart engines were being developed to produce much more power than expected. Consequently the updated Specification 21/49 was issued to represent the production Viscount which was ordered by BEA in 1950. Ultimately 445 Viscounts were built.

*The Type III called for a larger four-engined, medium-range aircraft for various multi-hop MRE routes serving the British Empire. This was intended initially to be the Avro 690 &quot;Type XXII&quot; with six Rolls-Royce Merlin engines which went through many specification changes and design evolutions to be the Avro 693 with four Rolls-Royce Avon jets. BOAC cancelled their order in April 1947 and the project was cancelled in July 1947. A new Specification 2/47 was issued for the MRE and this was developed as the Bristol Britannia. Unfortunately, this also suffered delays in development and did not enter service with BOAC until February 1957, despite having been ordered in November 1949.

*The Type IV became the world&#x27;s first jet airliner, the de Havilland Comet, the first prototype flying in July 1949. Initially successful, it suffered from well-publicized structural problems and failed to sell in great numbers.

*The Type VA requirement was developed as the Miles Marathon, first flying in May 1946. Following the collapse of Miles Aircraft, 40 were built by Handley Page for BEA who refused to take delivery, reducing their order for 30 by stages before eventually cancelling completely in 1952. The remainder were sold to airlines while the Royal Air Force were made to take 30 as navigation trainers.

*The Type VB requirement was met by the de Havilland Dove which had been commenced as a private venture in 1943. The prototype first flew in September 1945 and it continued in production until 1967, with production of 544. A larger version, the Heron, was developed and 149 were built between 1950 and 1967.

==Other aircraft==
Other aircraft were built as interim Brabazon types, plus some which were strictly not Brabazon types, but are often referred to as such. In some cases the Ministry would adopt a design by writing a specification for it. Some were built to the Brabazon specification in the hope of getting Ministry approval and finance, some were built totally as private ventures and others were contracted by the Ministry without reference to the Committee. The principal aircraft of note were:

* The Saunders-Roe SR.45 Princess was not a Brabazon Committee recommendation as a Type I aircraft but was direct submission from the company which gained Ministry funding. At the time, BOAC still considered that there was a future for luxury travel by flying boat. Three aircraft were built but BOAC ceased flying boat operations in November 1950 before the first flight in August 1952. No use was found for the three aircraft but they were not scrapped until 1967. 
* The Vickers VC.1 Viking was a private venture by Vickers of a new stressed-skin fuselage with wing of their Wellington bomber to speed development. It was notionally a Type IIA aircraft for short haul European routes. It achieved good success in its forms as the Viking, Varsity trainer and Valetta transport with 588 aircraft made, principally for the Royal Air Force.
* The Bristol 170 Freighter was a 1944 private venture for which the Ministry ordered two prototypes. Ultimately 214 were made and were used world-wide.

==Success and failure==

Of the seven Brabazon Report-derived designs that were produced, only two were outright successes, namely the Dove and the Viscount, although neither owed its success to the Brabazon Report: 
* De Havilland were designing the Dove as a private venture, having recognised the considerable market for a Dragon Rapide replacement. 
* The Viscount is one of the most successful airliners of its class, but the production version was a significantly larger and better aircraft than that specified by the Committee, thanks principally to Rolls-Royce who developed the Dart engine (albeit at a cost of some delay) and the determination of Vickers.

The others were all ill-fated in some way:
* The Type I Brabazon was ill-conceived from the start. The design was tailored to BOAC&#x27;s perceived needs, which in retrospect seem very odd and were certainly not shared by other airlines. BOAC and the Ministry believed that the passengers of the aircraft would be the particularly well-off or government employees, as they were the only ones able to afford air travel at the time. This led to a large amount of space per passenger in consideration of the long journey duration, which kept its operating costs high and made it too expensive to operate. They failed to consider the possibility of greatly increasing route capacity through the introduction of these designs, and the idea of a large number of passengers in the same airframe was not seriously considered. The airliners already being built in the US such as the Douglas DC-4, Douglas DC-6, Lockheed Constellation and Boeing 377 Stratocruiser were ignored, despite their proven performance and operating economics. 
* The Type IIA Ambassador served long but, having conflicted with the Viscount for the BEA order, it was then neglected by de Havilland who instead used the Airspeed factories to produce jet fighters. A proposed version with a turboprop engine could have been in operation long before the conception of the Dart Herald, the Avro 748 and the Fokker Friendship which all entered service in the late 1950s/early 1960s.
* The Type III Britannia ultimately proved to be an excellent design with a long service life, but suffered a prolonged development, largely due to the problems encountered with the Proteus engine. This series of delays before and after entering service led to it being in unequal competition with jet aircraft such as the Boeing 707. It also suffered from the &quot;Buy American&quot; attitude of BOAC. Had Bristol decided to build the proposed interim version with the Centaurus piston engine, the Britannia might have achieved greater sales.
* The Type IV Comet almost became an outstanding success. Two crashes caused by fatigue failure (then a virtually unknown technical issue) grounded them and the design changes required delayed reintroduction long enough for the US to catch up with the Boeing 707. 
* The Type VA Marathon suffered from the procurement process and from the collapse of Miles Aircraft.

==Legacy==
The Brabazon Committee was essentially a failure. All the major designs proposed suffered from protracted development periods at a time when airliners were needed quickly to compete with the American products; this was largely due to the time required to develop the new jet engines but was also due to failures of the Brabazon specifications, the poor decision making of the manufacturers and various UK government Ministries involved, and an amount of prejudice on the part of BOAC, the major customer whose input was not often requested. This prejudice by BOAC was seen subsequently in decisions such as cancelling the Vickers V.1000 airliner, failing to support the Vickers VC10 which had been designed to BOAC&#x27;s specification, and a continued desire to buy American products. BEA later requested a larger Viscount which became the Vickers Vanguard but which only sold 43, and then insisted on a smaller Trident than the design proposed by Hawker Siddeley. Consequently, the Trident, like the VC-10, failed to sell in significant numbers. The BAC 1-11 was more successful but suffered from a lack of investment in development as much government funding was directed to Concorde. Subsequently, after production of the HS146 ended in 2002, no more complete airliners have been designed or made in the UK, and the industry makes only components.

<doc id="324840" wikidata="Q643613" url="?curid=324840" title="Acanthosaura">
<text>Acanthosaura is a genus of lizards, commonly known as mountain horned dragons or pricklenape agamas, in the family Agamidae. The common name &quot;pricklenape&quot; refers to a row of dorsal spines which runs down the back of the neck. They are arboreal lizards found in Southeast Asia. They are medium-sized, their total length (including tail) ranging from about , depending on species and individual. As the common name &quot;mountain horned dragons&quot; implies, they tend to prefer higher elevation areas with dense vegetation.

==Diet==
Mountain horned dragons are insectivorous, consuming only live food. Common foods in captivity include crickets, earthworms, silkworms, mealworms, moths, roaches, wax worms, and grasshoppers. They require a variety in diet and will often refuse food when offered in excessive redundancy.

Typical &quot;Acanthosaura&quot; feeding behavior is a sit-and-wait style. They will perch off the ground until they spot their prey, which is often down on the ground. A display of aerobatics is not uncommon from &quot;Acanthosaura&quot; species when hunting food. They will eat and hunt fish, but most will not submerge their heads to catch a meal.

==Reproduction==
Females of the genus &quot;Acanthosaura&quot; lay their first clutch of eggs about four months after mating. They may lay up to four clutches total per year, separated by a month or two.

==In captivity==
Mountain horned dragons are popular pets, and readily available in the exotic pet trade. &quot;A. capra&quot; is considered the hardiest and most easily kept species of the genus, and is the most common species found for sale in the United States. While not considered to be difficult to breed in captivity, most specimens available are wild caught.
However, due to captive breeding, more and more captive bred lizards are available.

<text>Amphibolurus is a genus of lizards in the family Agamidae. The genus is endemic to Australia.

==Description==
Characteristics of the genus &quot;Amphibolurus&quot; include:

* Moderate size [snout–vent length ]
* Long limbs and long tail
* One to five crests consisting of enlarged, sometimes spinose scales (one nuchal and vertebral crest, sometime one or two dorsal crests on each side)
* Tympanum exposed
* One to 11 femoral pores and one to three preanal pores on each side
* Pattern usually includes three broad pale dorsal stripes and some blotches on a usually brown ground coloration
* Different from the similar species &quot;Lophognathus&quot; and &quot;Gowidon&quot; due to more heterogeneous arrangement of scales. They also differ from &quot;Gowidon&quot; due to more dorsal rows of enlarged, spinose scales.

==Habitat==
&quot;Amphibolurus&quot; lizards inhabit open forests, woodlands, and the vegetation around watercourses in southern, eastern, and central Australia.

==Behaviour==
Species in the genus &quot;Amphibolurus&quot; are partially arboreal and are often found perching on trunks and branches. Lizards of this genus are swift and shy, and when disturbed, they can engage in bipedal running.

==Species==
The following species are recognized as being valid, according to the Reptile Database.
*&quot;Amphibolurus burnsi&quot; – Burn&#x27;s dragon 
*&quot;Amphibolurus centralis&quot; – Centralian lashtail
*&quot;Amphibolurus muricatus&quot; – jacky dragon 
*&quot;Amphibolurus norrisi&quot; – Mallee Heath lashtail

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Amphibolurus&quot;.
