==Background==
Rosa María López Cortés was born in Peñuelas, Láchar (Granada) on 14 January 1981 to Eduardo López and Francisca Cortés. She was raised in the town of Peñuelas with her parents and her three brothers.

Rosa started singing at weddings, baptisms, communions and celebrations for the people of Granada over the weekends with her younger brother at the piano and her father. She was a member of several orchestras, and later created the Trio Roxa.

In September 2001, Rosa auditioned for new reality-show &quot;Operación Triunfo&quot; and she was selected to enter the show&#x27;s academy. On 22 October 2001, at the age of 20, she became one of the 16 contestants of the first season of &quot;Operación Triunfo&quot;. One of the prizes of the competition was to become the Spanish entrant at the Eurovision Song Contest 2002. Soon titled &quot;Rosa de España&quot; (&quot;Rose of Spain&quot;), she won the competition on 11 February 2002 with 26.6% of the votes, in a finale that achieved a record audience of 10,680,000 viewers and a share of 58.8%.

From 4 April to 1 June 2002, the 16 participants of &quot;Operación Triunfo&quot; toured 27 cities in Spain with 600,000 tickets sold, performing sold-out concerts at the Palau Sant Jordi in Barcelona and the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid. TVE 1 aired the Bernabéu Stadium concert, becoming the most watched concert in Spain, with 5,136,000 million viewers and a 39.5% share. The re-run of this concert on 9 July resulted in 3,174,000 million viewers and a 27.9% Share.

==Music career==
===2002–2005: First album and first success stories ===
Once proclaimed the winner of &quot;Operation Triunfo&quot;, López began her musical career by signing a three-album deal with Sony BMG Music, RCA Records and Vale Music. She starred in several TV spots like &quot;Todos contra el fuego&quot; for the Ministry of the Environment (along with fellow &quot;Operación Triunfo&quot; contestants), and for New World Jewels, the latter with a two-year deal. On 25 April 2002 she released the namesake studio album &quot;Rosa&quot;, consisting of Latin pop genre compositions by songwriters such as Armando Manzanero, Inma Serrano and José Luis Perales. The album was commercially successful selling over 500,000 copies in Spain, and her first single, &quot;Europe&#x27;s Living a Celebration&quot;, topped the hit list of radio Los 40 Principales. With &quot;Europe&#x27;s Living a Celebration&quot;, she finished in the 7th position at the Eurovision Song Contest 2002 in Tallinn. The summer after Eurovision, López extensively toured Spain. During the tour, she started having problems with her voice but continued working until mid-September, when she cancelled the rest of the tour. López spent a year out of the public eye and due to speculation, she called a press conference where she explained that she would soon return to the stage.

On 29 October 2003, López released her second album &quot;Ahora&quot;, with a dance-pop style. The album was a commercial success and exceeded sales projections reaching number one twice in the official albums chart; its lead single &quot;La esencia de tu voz&quot; topped Los 40 Principales&#x27; hit list. From April to September 2004, she conducted a promotional tour of the album. In June 2004, López traveled to Venezuela for a fortnight to promote the album to the media. A few weeks later she became the image of computer brand Odin. On 16 November 2004 she released her third album, &quot;Ójala&quot;, which was intended to be a small gift for her fans by singing Christmas songs and new songs written for the occasion. In 2005 López decided to take a sabbatical year with small appearances on television and a short tour with the Granada Blues Band touring major cities in the region of Andalusia.

The singer and Granada Blues Band recorded two singles, one of which became part of the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Buscando a Emma&quot;. A few months later, she recorded the title song of the movie &quot;Torrente 3: El protector&quot;.

===2006–2009: Musical transition and personal evolution===
In 2006, Rosa López undertook a new stage of her professional career, having lost 40 kilos of weight, with a modern image and more mature themes. In early 2006 she participated in the dancing talent show &quot;Mira quién baila&quot; (Spanish version of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;), where she was proclaimed winner of the season. On 30 May she launched her fourth studio album &quot;Me siento viva&quot; with dance-pop sounds that represented a major change from her previous works, mixed by internationally renowned sound engineers Ankelius Martin and Dan Hetzel. At the end of June, she started the tour &quot;Me siento viva&quot; until October; shortly after the start of the tour, she became the image of XLS products. In early December, she appeared in the special show commemorating the 50 years of history of Televisión Española, performing Rocío Jurado&#x27;s hit song &quot;Como una ola&quot;. Later that month, on 26 December 2006, also in TVE, she appeared in the special show &quot;Disco del Año&quot;, where the audience chose the best album of the year in Spain. Her album &quot;Me siento viva&quot; was named the best album of the year with the 27% of the votes.

During 2007, she debuted as an actress in the theatre play &quot;La menegilda&quot;, and also appeared in several TV series and television adverts. In summer 2007, she returned to stage for the &quot;Me siento viva&quot; concert tour. López decided to prepare a new album for early 2008, but due to the death of her father, the album was postponed. In 2008, she was chosen by TVE to represent Spain in the Eurovision Dance Contest 2008, but shortly before the competition took place TVE decided to pull out of the contest.

On 7 October 2008, her fifth studio album &quot;Promesas&quot; was released, consisting of covers of 10 classic international Pop-rock songs from the 80s and 90s, produced by Jordi Cristau. On 22 December López participated in the special show aired by TVE &quot;Plácido y la copla&quot;, a tribute to the copla genre and to Plácido Domingo, performing the songs &quot;Súspiros de España&quot; and &quot;La Zarzamora&quot;. In June 2009, she began the tour &quot;Promesas&quot; in her native city of Granada, which took her across the country.

On 3 November 2009, López released her sixth album &quot;Propiedad de nadie&quot;, consisting of songs written by José Luis Perales and produced by his song Pablo Perales.

López participated in the ceremony of Beatification of Leopold of Alpandeire at the airbase of Armilla, Granada, performing Schubert&#x27;s Ave Maria. Also that year, she conducted two tours across Spain: the &quot;Propiedad de nadie&quot; tour with 14 concerts, and the &quot;Gira 10 Aniversario&quot; tour with nine concerts, which prolonged until 2011.

Her seventh studio album, the second namesake album of her career &quot;Rosa López&quot;, was released on 19 June 2012, produced by Alejandro de Pinedo. The lead single of the album was a cover of Mari Trini&#x27;s song &quot;Yo no soy esa&quot;; the album was a return to the dance-pop genre after six years.

<text>François Achille Bazaine (13 February 181123 September 1888) was an officer of the French army. Rising from the ranks, during four decades of distinguished service (including 35 years on campaign) under Louis-Philippe and then Napoleon III, he held every rank in the army from fusilier to Marshal of France, the latter in 1863.

== Early life ==

François Achille Bazaine was born at Versailles, on 13 February 1811, from an affair prior to his father&#x27;s marriage, with Marie-Madeleine Josèphe dit Mélanie Vasseur. His father was General Pierre-Dominique Bazaine, a polytechnic (promotion X1803), meritorious engineer of Napoleon I, and director of the Institute of Communications Channels of the Russian Empire. His elder brother Pierre-Dominique Bazaine was a renowned engineer.

Achille Bazaine conducted studies at the Institute of Bader (or Barbet), then the college of Saint-Louis.

== French Foreign Legion &amp; Algeria ==

While not passing the academic entry test of the French Polytechnic School in 1830, he enlisted as a simple soldier (private) on 28 March 1831 at the 37th Infantry Division (), and was promoted to Caporal (Corporal) on 8 July 1831. He was subsequently passed to Corporal Fourrier on 13 January 1832 and Sergent (Sergeant) Fourrier (&quot;fourrier&quot;: non-commissioned officer responsible for stewardship) in July.

He arrived to the French Foreign Legion in August. He was designated as Sergent-Major, on 4 November, he attained the Epaulette on 2 November 1833. On 22 July 1835, he was wounded in the battle of Macta of fires to the wrist, and was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant and received a knight in france&#x27;s Legion of Honour.

With the Legion, he was ceded by Louis Philippe I to Queen Christine to combat the Carlists. Named immediately Spanish Captain at Foreign Title, he commanded a company of voltigeurs then was attached to the general staff headquarters of colonel Conrad. He was cited at the combats of Ponts in 1835, Lamanère in 1836, Huesca in 1837 and the battle of Barbastro in 1837, where he dragged out the body of general Conrad from the hands of the enemy, despite a bullet wound to the right leg. He was then attached to colonel Cariès de Senilhes, commissioner of the French government to the Army of Spain.

In 1838, he joined the 4th Light Infantry with his French rank of Lieutenant. On 20 October 1839, he was re-promoted to captain in the Legion in Algeria. In 1840, he passed to the 8th Chasseurs à Pied Battalion. He took in a part to the expeditions in Miliana where he was cited, from Kabylie and Morocco. Promoted to Commandant – Major, on 10 March 1844, he was assigned to the 58th Line Infantry Regiment in quality as the Arab Bureau Chief of Tlemcen. By decree on 9 November 1845, he was promoted to the rank of Officer in france&#x27;s Legion of Honour., following the combat of Sidi Kafir. Cited to the combat of Sidi Afis, on 24 March 1846, he passed to the 5th Line Infantry Regiment while still in charge of Arab relations, in 1847. He was cited at the combats of Afir for his contribution to the submission of AbdelKader in December. Promoted to Lieutenant-colonel on 11 April 1848, he was assigned to the 19th Light Infantry Regiment then went back to the 5th Line Infantry Regiment on 30 August in quality as superior commander of the place of Tlemcen. On 4 June 1850, he was designated as a colonel in the 55th Infantry Division () and Director of the Arab Affairs division of Oran.

On 4 February 1851, he was placed at the head of the 1st Regiment of the 1st Foreign Legion 1er R.E.L.E, and the next month, he commanded the subdivision of Sidi Bel Abbès (Algeria), a post which he occupied until 1854. During this commandment time, he married Maria Juaria Gregorio Tormo de la Soledad, on 12 June 1852.

== Crimea and Italy ==

On 28 October 1854, he was admitted to the 1st section of officer generals with the rank of Maréchal de camp and commanded two regiments of the Legion at the Army of the Orient. On 10 September 1855, he became the military commandant of Sevastopol and général de division on the next 22 September. During the Crimean War, he was wounded and cited during the attack of the &quot;Quarantaine&quot;, with a horse shot underneath him, the same day. On 16 August 1856, following the combat of Sidi Kafirhe, he was awarded a citation, and, by decree, his French Legion of Honour rank was upgraded to the rank of Commander. for the apprehension of the position of Kinbourn at the closing of Dniepr, which he concluded in three days.

The way in which he conducted the left wing of the French forces in the final Allied assault on Sebastopol on 8 September 1855 (wounded, shell fragment in left hip, his horse killed under him), received acclaim of the highest order from the Allied Command and he was subsequently promoted to Major General (General de Division) on 22 September 1855 and selected from all the Allied Generals to assume the Governorship of Sebastopol.

At 44, this made him the youngest General in the French Army. In October 1855, Bazaine was chosen to give the &quot;coup de grâce&quot;. With a mixed French and British Force, he sailed to Kinburn at the mouth of the Dnieper to attack the remaining Russian forces to the North of Sebastopol. He led a daring landing and seized the naval fortress with a frontal assault, an action for which he received particular praise: &quot;General Bazaine who commands that portion of the French Army now operating at the mouth of the Dnieper may be cited as presenting one of the most brilliant examples of the achievement of military distinction in the modern day&quot;. At Sebastopol, on 25 June 1856 he was invested by the British Commander in Chief, Lord Gough, with the Order of the Bath, for his conspicuous contribution to the Allied campaign during the Crimean War.

Upon his return to France, he occupied the post of inspector of the infantry then commanded the 19th Infantry Division () at Bourges.

Commander of the 3rd Infantry Division () of the 1st Army Corps of Achille Baraguey d&#x27;Hilliers, he was close to the combat line of Melegnano, on 8 June 1859, and the Battle of Solferino, on 24 June, during the conquest of the cemetery.

Actually, during that year in 1859, he commanded the Division in the Franco-Sardinian campaign against Austrian forces in Lombardy. He was wounded by a shell splinter in the head on 8 June, during the action at the Battle of Melegnano. He recovered to play a conspicuous part in the Solferino, which he captured on 24 June 1859, despite being wounded again (bullet to the upper thigh) and having his horse shot from under him again, earning another citation.

== Mexico ==
Returned to Paris, he was designated as the general inspector of the 4th and 5th infantry arrondissements. The souvenir of Spain made him suggest to Napoleon III to lend the French Foreign Legion to the new emperor in Mexico. This idea would become that of the Emperor.

Bazaine was later designated to be part of France&#x27;s expedition to Mexico.

Commandant of the 1st Infantry Division of expeditionary corps to Mexico on 1 July 1862, his action was decisive during the siege of Puebla in 1863. He commanded with great distinction the First Division under General (afterwards Marshal) Forey in the Mexican expedition in 1862, where he pursued the war with great vigour and success, driving President Benito Juárez to the frontier. His decisive action was instrumental in the taking of the city of Puebla in 1863. As a consequence, he was cited and designated at the head of the expeditionary corps by replacing Élie Frédéric Forey. Amongst the citations he received for the battle of San Lorenzo was the title of Grand Cross of France&#x27;s Legion of Honour. Bazaine, who had started as a Legionnaire, was elevated to the dignity of Marshal of France and Senator of the Second French Empire by Imperial decree on 5 September 1864. He commanded in person the siege of Oaxaca in February 1865, following which, the Emperor complimented him while decorating him with the Médaille militaire, on 28 April 1865.

Here as in 1870, two of Bazaine&#x27;s nephews, Adolphe and Albert Bazaine-Hayter served with their uncle as his aide-de-camp. Bazaine&#x27;s African experience as a soldier and as an administrator stood him in good stead in dealing with the &quot;guerrilleros&quot; of the Juárez party, but he was less successful in his relations with Maximilian, with whose court the French headquarters was in constant strife.

His first wife died while he was in Mexico. On 28 May 1865, while still in Mexico, Bazaine got engaged and married to Maria-Josefa Pedraza de la Peña y Barragán, who was described as belonging to &quot;a respectable Mexican family, well connected with the Spanish aristocracy and had numerous friends in high places&quot; by the media at the time. Maximilian I of Mexico offered him the palace of Buena Vista.

Opinion is divided on his actions. Some argued that he aimed to depose Maximilian and get the throne of Mexico for himself, or that he aspired to play the part of a Bernadotte. In a New York Times opinion piece:- 

His conduct in Mexico had been so unprincipled, so rascally in every respect, that it had been even a question at one time of trying him by court-martial.

In a contrary New York Times opinion piece:- 

Marshal Bazaine has long rested under a cloud in his country on account of his connection with the invasion of Mexico by Maximillian, and, feeling as Americans did and still do about this enterprise of Emperor Napoleon, it is difficult to form an unprejudiced estimate of the character of the man who took so prominent a part in that fortunately unsuccessful effort to established an empire on our Southern border. The Marshal, however, was simply obeying the orders of his Government, and should not be held responsible for his action in Mexico.
His marriage to a rich Mexican lady (Pepita de la Peña y Azcarate), whose family were supporters of Juárez, still further complicated his relations with the unfortunate emperor, and when at the close of the American Civil War the United States sent a powerful war-trained army to the Mexican frontier. On the commend of Napoleon III, Bazaine withdraw the French forces to France, embarkation at Veracruz (1867). His wife followed him back to France.

Consequently, his relations with Emperor Maximilian became tense. He was accused of dragging the expedition against the will of Napoleon III, a situation which provoked his repatriation. On 12 November 1867, he obtained the commandment of the 3rd Army Corps at Nancy, and the following year, he commanded the camp of Châlons then replaced Auguste Regnaud de Saint-Jean d&#x27;Angély at the head of the Imperial Guard.

== Franco-Prussian War ==

At the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, Bazaine took field command of the French front line forces of III Army Corps of the Army of the Rhine near Metz.

=== Prelude ===

On 12 August 1870, during the war, Bazaine was nominated as the commander-in-chief of the Army of the Rhine, which was forced to deploy towards Châlons-sur-Marne to rejoin reserves in order to face the German troops. On the other hand, while he was presented with the occasion to destroy several enemy army corps following the Battle of Mars-la-Tour, on 16 August, he decided, to the astonishment of his general staff headquarters, to deploy his army of 180,000 men at Metz, accordingly cutting himself off from France and his reserves. Two days later, on the eve of the Battle of Saint-Privat, Marshal François Certain de Canrobert urgently and repeatedly requested reinforcements from Bazaine, but did not obtain them. The latter had judged that Saint-Privat was not an important battle and refused to engage his reserve troops, which were numerous. No reinforcements were sent to the French troops which were engaged heroically in combat on the plateau and Bazaine didn&#x27;t even appear on the field of battle.

Directing the only truly organized armed force of France at that moment, he seemed to consider it mainly as a political tool and contemplated the various intrigues, notably with the Empress, probably to restore the Empire torn since 4 September. He negotiated equally with the Germans the authorization of an exit of his army « pour sauver la France d&#x27;elle-même » (to save France from itself), which meant from the republican push, as in revolutionary. It was during this stage that he vigorously opposed captain Louis Rossel who wanted to pursue the war and not betray his country (Rossel was the only officer to join since 19 March 1871 the Paris Commune).

Since the Fall of Sedan, on 2 September, he represented the last hope in the French camp, Bazaine renounced to pursue combat and capitulated on 28 October. This surrender is often explained by the lack of motivation of Bazaine to defend a government which was corresponding less and less to his conservative ideas. However, Bazaine also presented the situation differently in a letter on 2 November 1870 in the &quot;Journal du Nord&quot; (Northern Journal): &quot;famine, the atmospheres brought down the arms of 63,000 real combatants which remained (the artillery no longer fixed and the cavalry demounted, all this after having eaten the majority of horses and searched the land in all directions to find rarely a weak provision to general privations).[...] Add to this dark painting more 20,000 sick or wounded to the point of absence of medicines and a torrential rain since 15 days now, flooding the camps and not allowing the men to rest because their small tents were the only shelter they had&quot;.

The news of this surrender afflicted France, while general Louis-Jules Trochu couldn&#x27;t even seem to loosen the German noose around Paris which was besieged. Léon Gambetta, gone to Tours in the hope to assemble a Liberation army, understood that his initiative was unworkable and accordingly launched a proclamation where he explicitly accused Bazaine of treason in his speech: &quot;Metz was capitulated. A general on whom France was counting, even after Mexico, just lifted from the Nation more than a 100,000 of its defenders. Marshal Bazaine has betrayed. He has made himself the agent of Sedan, the partner in crime with the invader, and, in the middle of the army which had the guard of, he simply delivered it, without even attempting a supreme effort, 120,000 combatants, 20,000 wounded, guns, cannons, the flags and the strongest citadels of France, Metz, virgin, to him, of foreign defilements&quot;.

=== Takes over as Commander in Chief from Napoleon III ===

Bazaine took no part in the earlier battles, but after the defeats of Marshal MacMahon&#x27;s French Forces at Wörth and Marshal Canrobert&#x27;s at Forbach, Napoleon III (who was in increasingly poor health) was swift to give Bazaine the title of Commander-in-Chief of the French Army on 13 August 1870. At the time, Napoleon&#x27;s choice was considered to be a wise one. It was widely believed by French politicians and soldiers alike, that if anyone was capable of saving France from the Prussian onslaught, it was &quot;notre glorieux Bazaine&quot; (&quot;our glorious Bazaine&quot;). He was the only remaining Marshal of France not to have suffered defeat at the hands of Prussian forces in the early weeks of the war. However, being the youngest of the French Marshals, Napoleon&#x27;s choice was met with suspicion and jealousy by the older, socially superior Marshals. Hence it was with reluctance that he took up the chief command, and his tenure became the central act in the tragedy of 1870. He found the army in retreat, ill-equipped and numerically at a great disadvantage, and the generals and officers discouraged and distrustful of one another. Bazaine&#x27;s solution was to bring back his army to Metz. The day after assuming command of the Army, on 14 August at Borny he was badly wounded by a shell on the left shoulder, a fact which was to be excluded from his service roll presented at his Court Martial in 1873.

=== Spicheren ===
The armies of France, led by Bazaine, took up defensive positions that would protect against every possible attack, but which also left their armies unable to support one another. Taking up &quot;strong positions&quot; in small-scale battles, was a common military strategy of French generals of 1870. Frossard (&quot;the school master&quot;), lately the Prince Imperial&#x27;s tutor, who was now in commander of the army corps posted at Spicheren, was a &quot;strong position&quot; tactic advocate. The &quot;strong positions&quot; tactic has been blamed for the paralysis of the rest of the army, which left the corps at Spicheren unsupported, and ultimately lead to the French defeat at the ensuing Battle of Spicheren. When called upon, Bazaine moved part of his corps forward, but only to &quot;take up strong positions,&quot; not to strike a blow on the battlefield.

Remaining in Metz was based on the knowledge that if the slow-moving French army ventured far out it would infallibly be headed off and brought to battle in the open by a superior numbered adversary. In &quot;strong positions&quot; close to his stronghold, however, Bazaine hoped that he could inflict damaging repulses on the German enemy. The over-cautious troop movement, to prevent surprise rushes and ambushes, reduced the mobility of a large army, which had favourable marching conditions, to 5 miles a day as against the enemy&#x27;s rate of 15 miles a day. Bazaine attempted halfheartedly to begin a retreat on Verdun. In his book &quot;Episodes de la guerre de 1870 et le blocus de Metz&quot;, Bazaine retrospectively argues that Verdun was the best line of defense for France, and therefore Napoleon was right in ordering a retreat to Verdun, after the defeats of August. However, the French staff work and organization of the movement over the Moselle was so ineffective that when the German staff calculated that Bazaine was nearing Verdun, the French had in reality barely got their artillery and baggage trains through the town of Metz. Even on the battlefield Bazaine forbade the general staff to appear, and conducted the fighting by means of his personal orderly officers.
=== Mars-la-Tour ===
A cavalry patrol of the 1st Squadron of the 1st Hanoverian Dragoon Regiment No. 9, led by Rittmeister Oskar von Blumenthal, discovered that Marshal François Bazaine&#x27;s 160,000-man Army of the Rhine was attempting to escape from Metz to join with French forces at Verdun. This intelligence prompted General Prince Friedrich Karl, commander of the Prussian Second Army, to order at 1900 on 15 August a grossly outnumbered group of 30,000 men of the advanced III Corps under General Constantin von Alvensleben to cut off the French line of retreat at Mars-la-Tour and Vionville. Bazaine&#x27;s army had passed through on its way to Metz, and was attacked by this isolated corps of the enemy near the village of Mars-la-Tour. Bazaine&#x27;s was able to successful repel the attack in spite of the fierce fighting by the two German corps. However, Alvensleben defeated all attempts by four French corps to dislodge his III Corps. On 16 August, Alvensleben attacked the French advance guard, believing that it was the rearguard of the retreating Army of the Rhine. Despite his misjudgment, Alvensleben held off four French corps for seven hours. The French could have swept away the key Prussian defense and escaped, however, Bazaine had no confidence in his generals or his troops, and contented himself with inflicting severe losses on the most aggressive portions of the German army. Ultimately the aggression and skill of the Prussians prevailed over Bazaine&#x27;s gross indecision.

Citing the need to acquire more ammunition and the distance from the supply trains, Bazaine issued an order on the night of 16–17 August for his army to fall back closer to Metz. The strong defensive positions of the fortress would, he thought, enable him to inflict massive losses on the Germans and crush their armies. After resupplying, Bazaine would begin anew the march to the Meuse on 19 and 20 August. Despite some skirmishing on 17 August, the Prussians did not pursue the French in force, as attacking that day was not their intention. The French withdrew to the Plappeville plateau east of Gravelotte over the course of the day. There the Battle of Gravelotte would be fought on 18 August.

=== Gravelotte and Sedan ===
Two days later, while the French actually retreated on Metz (taking seven hours to cover 5 to 6 miles) the masses of the Germans gathered in front of Bazaine&#x27;s Army at Gravelotte, intercepting his communication with the interior of France. This Bazaine expected, and feeling certain that the Germans would sooner or later attack him in his chosen position, he made no attempt to interfere with their concentration. The great battle was fought, and having inflicted severe punishment on his assailants, Bazaine fell back within the entrenched camp of Metz. But although he made no appeals for help, the only remaining army of France, Marshal Mac-Mahon&#x27;s &quot;Army of Châlons&quot;, moved to rescue Bazaine. Napoleon III followed close behind MacMahon&#x27;s army in a carriage. When on 2 September 1870, MacMahon blundered into a German trap at Sedan, the Emperor mounted a horse despite his pain, rode along the firing line for hours seeking death. It never found him. Napoleon III surrendered with 80,000 men. With Sedan the Second Empire collapsed, Napoleon III being taken as a prisoner of war.

=== Siege of Metz ===
The Prussian army of 200,000 men now besieged the city of Metz, where 3 French marshals, 50 generals, 135,000 men, and 600 guns were encircled. Bazaine attempted to break the siege at Noisseville on 31 August but the French were repulsed, losing 3,500 men in the attempt. There were supplies in Metz to last no more than a month, such that by early September the order was given for work horses to be slaughtered for food. By mid September, cavalry horses also began to be slaughtered. Without cavalry and horses to pull the guns, Bazaine&#x27;s ability to mount effective attempts to break out rapidly diminished. On 7 October, hungry and immobilised, Bazaine dispatched two 40,000 man foraging parties along both banks of the Moselle, but the Prussian guns blew the French wagons off the road and the Prussian infantry cut swathes through the desperate French soldiers with Chassepots captured at Sedan. Over 2,000 men were lost in this operation. Typhus and smallpox was spreading and by 10 October, it is estimated that 19,000 of the French troops in Metz were hospitalised. A further attempt was made to break the siege on 18 October at Bellevue, but again the French troops were repulsed, with the loss of 1,250 men. The city was on its knees, the troops and inhabitants on the point of starvation.

=== Diplomacy, then surrender ===

As commander of the only remaining organized army of France, Bazaine refused to recognise the new Government of National Defence, formed following Napoleon&#x27;s capture and the resulting collapse of his government, and instead engaged in a series of diplomatic negotiations with the Prussian high command and Empress Eugenie who with the Prince Imperial had fled to Hastings, England. The purport of these negotiations still remain to some extent obscure, but it is beyond question that he proposed with the permission of the Prussians to employ his army in &quot;saving France from herself&quot;, perhaps to ignite a revolution against the government of the Third Republic. When considered in light of the fact that Bazaine had long been a known Bonapartist, his actions were clearly designed to forge a way to restore the monarchy.

The scheme collapsed. In 1870, he surrendered the last organized French army to Prussia during the Franco-Prussian War at the siege of Metz. Upon surrendering, the Army of the Rhine became prisoners of war to the number of 180,000. This surrender is often explained by Bazaine&#x27;s lack of motivation to defend a government that corresponded less and less to his political ideals and the best interests of France, as he saw it. A week&#x27;s further resistance would have potentially enabled the levies of the National Defence government to crush the weak forces of the Germans on the Loire and to relieve Paris. Upon Bazaine&#x27;s surrender, the army of Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia was deployed to the Second Battle of Orléans.

== Military Commentary ==

Bazaine&#x27;s awareness of his army&#x27;s shortcomings against the well-known speed and menacing efficiency of the Prussian military machine, was evidenced in his remark to a friend whilst boarding the train from Paris to Metz: &quot;&quot;Nous marchons à un désastre&quot;.&quot; (&quot;We are walking into a disaster.&quot;) In Bazaine&#x27;s book &quot;Episodes de la guerre de 1870 et le blocus de Metz&quot;, he later stated:- 

&quot;The initiatives of the Marshals or Generals placed at the head of the seven great Territorial Army Divisions was simply null. They were left to the directions of the Minister of War, and, what is more they could obtain no information as to the works of the same, or movement of material. For my part I saw the mitrailleuses only on their arrival at Metz.&quot;

From Bazaine&#x27;s military analysis of various lessons of the war, e.g. Waterloo, i.e. that a line of resolute men on the defensive could again and again break an enemy attack; Mexico, i.e. Lee&#x27;s dashing Confederates lose a war despite their commander&#x27;s brilliance in attack; Africa, i.e. that dramatic sorties were invaluable in North Africa but risky against European armies; and the Prussian all-steel Krupp breech-loading gun which shaped the future of battlefield artillery, resulted on him concluding that the best approach for France is not an offensive one, stating &quot;It is better to conduct operations systematically, i.e., defensively, as in the Seventeenth Century.&quot;

Later, in his book &quot;Episodes de la guerre de 1870 et le blocus de Metz&quot;, he laid the blame on the course of the war upon:-

&quot;False patriots who mislead the nation, carrying it away to a resistance disastrous for the country, and only meant as a pedestal for themselves to mount on.&quot;
== Trial ==

=== Prelude ===

The defection of Bazaine liberated the army of besieging Germans, who hastened to Orléans to front face the initiative in progress of raising a Republican Army. It was then therefore easy to assign the moral weight of the defeat to Bazaine. In August 1873, he arrived at Paris, where an investigation was opened on the initiative of General Ernest Courtot de Cissey. The investigative board gave their advice which led to several accusations. Bazaine then requested that the case be presented to a war council. The royalists and the republicans held their &quot;bouc émissaire&quot; in order to lay all the responsibilities of a defeat on a Bonapartist and justify the proclamation of the French Republic of 4 September 1870, and attempting to show the incapacity of the Emperor, through his subordinate. Certain Bonapartists were not unhappy that Bazaine was being judged, as this obscured accordingly the responsibilities of Napoleon III. Bazaine was then the ideal expiatory victim, who was brought in front of a war council sitting at Grand Trianon. The Duke of Aumale, President, condemned him to death with military degradation for having capitulated in an open campaign, collaborated with the enemy, and surrendered Metz before having exhausted all available means of defense. However, the same tribunal, which just condemned him, signed unanimously and sent to the President of France (and the Minister of War) a request for mercy in regards to &quot;M. Marshal Bazaine&quot;. His sentence was commuted then to 20 years in prison, without degradation ceremony, by the new president, Marshal MacMahon, who also was beaten at Sedan. This inspired Victor Hugo to remark: &quot;Mac-Mahon absolves Bazaine. Sedan washes Metz. The idiot protects the traitor.&quot;

=== Trial for Treason ===

The French nation could not rest with the thought that their military supremacy had been broken by the superiority of the Prusso-German armies; their defeats could have proceeded only from the treachery or incapacity of their leaders. The commanders who had surrendered the French fortresses to the enemy were subjected to a trial by court-martial under the presidency of Marshal Baraguey d&#x27;Hilliers. The majority of them were, on account of their proved incapacity or weakness, deprived of their military honours. Even Ulrich, the once celebrated commander of Strasbourg, whose name had been given to a street in Paris, was brought under the censure of the court-martial. However, Bazaine, as Commander-in-Chief, was attributed with the blame for the Third Republic for France&#x27;s defeat at the hands of the Prussians.

On return from German captivity in 1872, Bazaine published his account of the events of 1870 in &quot;L&#x27;Armée du Rhin&quot; and formally requested and was granted a trial before a military court, in order to give an opportunity to clear his name and put his version of events to the public. For months he was imprisoned at the Grand Trianon in the Palace of Versailles with his wife and two youngest children, while preparations were made for the court-martial, which started the following year (6 October 1873) under the presidency of the Duc D&#x27;Aumale in the Grand Trianon&#x27;s Peristyle. 

For some time the Duke and his colleagues had been looking for a way out of their difficulty, by which they could save themselves, satisfy public clamor and yet avoid responsibility before history. Bazaine stated in his defence &quot;I have graven on my chest two words – &#x27;Honneur&#x27; et &#x27;Patrie&#x27;. They have guided me for the whole of my military career. I have never failed that noble motto, no more at Metz than anywhere else during the forty-two years that I have loyally served France. I swear it here, before Christ&quot;. Despite a vigorous defence of Bazaine&#x27;s actions by Lachaud, and the presentation of a number of strong witness statements from his staff including Colonel Willette, the court found Bazaine guilty of negotiating with and capitulating to the enemy before doing all that was prescribed by duty and honour.

Opinion has been divided on the veracity of the trial. One New York Times commentary piece wrote:- 

&quot;There was nothing shown in the trial at Versailles to prove to unprejudiced observers that Bazaine was a traitor, or that he had done all in his power to extricate his army from the perilous position in which it had been placed.&quot; 

Bazaine surrendered only after receiving letters recommending him to do so from his generals, but the presentation of these at the trial was ignored. &quot;I have read every word of the evidence [against Bazaine] and believe it to be the most malicious casuistry&quot; (New York Times correspondent). A letter which Prince Frederick Charles wrote in Bazaine&#x27;s favour only added to the wrath of the people, who cried aloud for his execution.

Another, contrary New York Times commentary piece wrote:- 

The proofs alleged against him make it clear that he thought not of defeating or escaping from the enemy, but solely of becoming the arbiter of the fortunes of France. His defense is valueless against the evidence not only of witnesses, but of his own acts and writings. He, in short, convicts himself, and his habitual trickery and his ingrained habits of falsehood render it impossible to accept his own word on any subject. We not only consider the accusation fully proved against him, but we believe that his conduct was even worse than it appeared to be.&quot;
=== Sentencing ===

Sentenced to death by the government of the Third Republic following the war. The court unanimously sentenced Bazaine to &#x27;degradation and death&#x27;, and to pay the costs of the enormous trial (300,000 francs), which was to leave Bazaine&#x27;s family penniless. Bazaine&#x27;s reaction on being read the sentence of the court was &quot;It is my life you want, take it at once, let me be shot immediately, but preserve my family&quot;. Since the Revolution, only two French Marshals have been condemned to death — Ney, by a Bourbon, and Bazaine, by an Orléans. But, as though the judges themselves felt a twinge of conscience at the sentence, they immediately and unanimously signed a petition for &#x27;Executive Clemency&#x27; to the President of the Third Republic, Marshal MacMahon, although Bazaine refused to sign this petition himself.

Bazaine petitioned the government to commute his punishment to a simple banishment. MacMahon, was a fellow Foreign Legion Officer, had served in many campaigns alongside Bazaine, also been beaten at Sedan. MacMahon was visibly disgusted when he received the news of the Court&#x27;s decision and was incensed by their attempt to pass responsibility to him. MacMahon first proposed life imprisonment, though he softened and commuted the punishment of death to twenty years&#x27; imprisonment and remitted the disgrace of the formalities of a military degradation ceremony.

Bazaine wrote to thank his fellow legionnaire, though he added, tongue in cheek, that he might have let his feelings run away with him. It was an academic concession for a man nearing sixty-three. Other have judged this move harshly in later years, with Victor Hugo writing “Mac-Mahon absolves Bazaine. Sedan washes Metz. The fool protects the traitor.&quot;

=== Escape ===

Bazaine was incarcerated in the Fort Royal on Île Sainte-Marguerite and treated rather as an exile than as a convict. During the night of 9–10 August 1874, at the instigation of his wife (Pepita) and assistance, who was only twenty-six in 1873, and with the help of ex-Captain Doineau of the Arab Bureaux, his aide de camp lieutenant-colonel Henri-Léon Willette, Bazaine escaped after two hundred and twenty-one days of imprisonment. During the night of 10 August 1874, using parcel rope supplied by Angelo Hayter, (son of the Court Painter Sir George Hayter) and baggage straps which he knotted into a rope, the 63-year-old attached one end to his body and tied the other end to a gargoyle and climbed down the 300 foot cliffs to a boat, which his wife had brought out from Cannes. They sailed to Genoa in Italy, and from there Bazaine came to London with his young family where he stayed for a time with his Hayter relations.

Bazaine was the only prisoner to have escaped from the Fort Royal. A terrace of the fort, now housing a museum, is today named after Bazaine, due to his legendary escape.

== Later life ==

By midsummer 1875, Bazaine had settled in Madrid, where he was treated with marked respect by the Spanish government of Alfonso XII, in deference to his role in the Carlist War. Queen Isabella had arranged lodgings for him and his family in the Calle Hortaleza. With his own means stripped of him, he had his eldest son&#x27;s pay to depend upon besides the assistance of some well-known army men who were charitable to the old soldier. However Bazaine&#x27;s position in society was undermined by the negative influence of France. Admiral Jaures (French Ambassador in Madrid) had made it a rule to leave every ball, fete, or drawing room where he met Bazaine, on several instances naming the Court-Martial as the reason.

== Assassination attempt ==

On 18 April 1887, Hillairand, a French national and correspondent for the Paris newspaper Courrier de Rochelle, was paying a visit to Bazaine in Madrid. Bazaine&#x27;s report of the incident was that &quot;He thought, at first, that the man was an applicant for alms, like so many Frenchmen at Madrid&quot;. After a short conversation, Hillairand stabbed Bazaine with a dagger (&quot;poniard&quot;), who was dangerously, though not fatally, wounded on the head. During the attack, Hillairan shouted &quot;J&#x27;ai vengé ma patrie&quot; (&quot;I avenged my country.&quot;), telling police later that he had come there with the intention of killing Bazaine. The wound was said to be &quot;slight&quot;, and Bazaine was described as &quot;slowly recovering&quot; from his wound a month later.

==Personal life ==

Bazaine was initially married to Maria Juaria Gregorio Tormo de la Soledad, on 12 June 1852, during his commandment of the Sidi Bel Abbès (Algeria) subdivision of the 1er R.E.L.E. (1851-1854). His first wife died while he was in Mexico, and Bazaine got engaged and married to Maria-Josefa Pedraza de la Peña y Barragán on 28 May 1865. Bazaine had three children, one daughter (Eugenie Bazaine) and two sons. His youngest son predeceased him in Cuba. His eldest son (Alfonse Bazaine) outlived him, becoming a noted Spanish officer.

==Death==

Bazaine&#x27;s health had progressively slowly deteriorated due to the injuries received during his 40-year-long military career. Pepita took her daughter and one of her sons to Mexico, to look after the little fortune she had left, awaiting Mexican government compensation for the couple&#x27;s property losses. Bazaine stayed in Madrid (Spain) with his eldest son, Alfonse Bazaine. He downgraded his lodgings to the Calle Atocha, where he cooked for himself, retaining his cigars as his one remaining luxury.

After the departure of his family, Bazaine&#x27;s health declined. His eyesight deteriorated, and he broke his leg whilst walking on a frosty day in Retiro Park. He began to take little care of his personal appearance, growing a long grayish beard and became a source of pity by local Spaniards. At his Madrid lodgings, Bazaine died of a stroke on 23 September 1888 (aged 77), after an infection he contracted during the Madrid winter of 1887/8. 
Afonse Bazaine, now a Corporal of the Chasseurs in the Spanish army, was away from Madrid when his father died.

Bazaine&#x27;s remains were interred on 24 September 1888 in the Madrid&#x27;s San Justo Cemetery. An official funeral was celebrated in the presence of the Minister of War, Spanish marshals including Marshal Campos, one of his brothers, and his sons. Bazaine&#x27;s sword and epaulettes rested on his coffin, instead of floral emblems.

The officiating priest was a relative of his wife.

Bazaine&#x27;s daughter (Eugenie Bazaine), returned from Mexico back to Spain on 20 January 1900 an orphan, after the subsequent death of her mother who had been taken to hospital with a serious illness on 26 December 1899.

==Reputation==

Harsh criticism featured in French newspapers upon Bazaine&#x27;s death &quot;Let his corpse be flung in to the first ditch. As for his memory, it is nailed forever to the pillory&quot;. German papers refer to Bazaine kindly and repeated that he was wronged by his own people.

On 7 July 1911, the Mister of Justice received a petition from Bazaine&#x27;s son Alfonse Bazaine asking for the rehabilitation of his father. In commenting on the application the &quot;Correspodencia Militar&quot;, the organ of the Spanish War Office, said:-

&quot;Many persons believe that the unfortunate Marshal was the victim of a fatality or a mistake of judgment, and many articles and books have been printed in his defense, and now, at length, a worthy Spanish officer, son of Marshal Bazaine, has addressed to the Minister of Justice of the French Republic a request, based on the terms of the law of 1895, for the revision of judgment of the court-martial of Trianon which convicted his late father. It is quite possible, indeed certain, that the position of Alphonse Bazaine will revive in France as well as abroad a passionate controversy as to the guilt or innocence of the Marshal.&quot;

In the same year as Bazaine&#x27;s death, Count d&#x27;Herrison published an account in defence of the Bazaine&#x27;s decisions during the Franco-Prussian war, which casting doubt upon the characters and motivations of witnesses whose testimonies were key to the court&#x27;s findings that Bazaine was guilty of treason. Between 1904 and 1912, the French Court of Appeal lawyer Élie Peyron published several works in Bazaine&#x27;s defence.

&quot;The Duke, Marshal and 3rd President of France de MacMahon, survived Bazaine by five years; Paris gave President Marshal MacMahon a funeral that choked the wide boulevards for hours. The &quot;&quot; of Marshals de Canrobert, last of the Foreign Legion Marshals of the Second French Empire, was buried like a prince in 1895. The Foreign Legion, which has never felt obliged to accept the French view on anything, still honours Bazaine. In its museum there exists almost no trace of MacMahon, nor of Canrobert or of de Saint-Arnaud. Bazaine however has his own corner, adorned with his battered kepi, the bits and pieces of the harness he used at Rezonville and Gravelotte, and the cross Conrad pinned on him after Macta. The Legion knows that courage is not a mask that a soldier can wear or discard at will&quot;. 

The Legion annually pays tribute to Bazaine.

== Decorations ==

For the accusations brought upon him, he was suspended of his rights to wear his French and Foreign decorations.

The decorations and distinctions which he had formerly earned were:

* Grand Cross of France&#x27;s Legion of Honour (2 July 1863) 
* Médaille Militaire
* Commemorative Medals of Crimea, Italy and Mexico 
* Companion of the Order of the Bath
* Knight Grand Cross of the Italian Order of Savoy
* Grand Ciordon of the Order of Léopold of the Belgians
* Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Lion and the Sun of Persia
* Grand Cross of the Order of the Mexican Eagle
* Knight Grand Cross of the Order of our Lady of Guadalupe
* Knight of the Order of St. Ferdinand of Spain
* Knight of the Order of Charles III of Spain
* Knight of the Order of Isabel the Catholic
* Silver Medal of the Old Military Order of Savoy

He was cited 10 times for serving France and 4 times for serving Spain.

== Works ==

Bazaine published a number of books about the Franco-Prussian war, and his version of events.

In the spartan rooms of the Calle Hortaleza, he wrote &quot;Episodes de la guerre de 1870 et le blocus de Metz&quot;, which was published in 1883 during Bazaine&#x27;s exile in Madrid. This book also recorded his defence against the 1873 accusation of treason, it was not directed to a vindication of Bazaine&#x27;s conduct during the Franco-German War, but instead a sort of history of that disastrous campaign, with a considerable portion of the book devoted to setting forth how the catastrophes of 1870 might have been prevented, or at least diminished, providing facsimiles of official documents, dispatches, and letters, including a report addressed by the Emperor Napoleon in captivity at Wilhelmshohe and a communication to Empress Engénie during the events of Metz, and maps to elucidate the campaign. In France this work was immediately forbidden.

==Appearances in Fiction==
There is a brief reference to Bazaine in David Weber&#x27;s science fiction novel, &quot;In Death&#x27;s Ground&quot; (1997), the third novel in that author&#x27;s &quot;Starfire&quot; series of novels.

Clamence in Albert Camus&#x27;s novella &quot;The Fall&quot; refers to family and connections as &#x27;Bazaines&#x27;

His actions during the French interdiction in Mexico are recorded in Norman Zollinger&#x27;s novel &quot;Chapultepec.&quot;

Along with Napoleon III, Bazaine plays a small, but crucial role, in &quot;April and the Extraordinary World&quot;.

<text>Minimum Description Length (MDL) is a model selection principle where the shortest description of the data is the best model. MDL methods learn through a data compression perspective and are sometimes described as mathematical applications of Occam&#x27;s razor. The MDL principle can be extended to other forms of inductive inference and learning, for example to estimation and sequential prediction, without explicitly identifying a single model of the data. 

MDL has its origins mostly in information theory and has been further developed within the general fields of statistics, theoretical computer science and machine learning, and more narrowly computational learning theory.

Historically, there are different, yet interrelated, usages of the definite noun phrase &quot;&quot;the&quot; minimum description length &quot;principle&quot; that vary in what is meant by &quot;description&quot;:
* Within Jorma Rissanen&#x27;s theory of learning, a central concept of information theory, models are statistical hypotheses and descriptions are defined as universal codes.
* Rissanen&#x27;s 1978 pragmatic first attempt to automatically derive short descriptions, relates to the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).
* Within Algorithmic Information Theory, where the description length of a data sequence is the length of the smallest program that outputs that data set. In this context, it is also known as &#x27;idealized&#x27; MDL principle and it is closely related to Solomonoff&#x27;s theory of inductive inference, which is that the best model of a data set is represented by its shortest self-extracting archive.

==Overview==

Selecting the minimum length description of the available data as the best model observes the &quot;principle&quot; identified as Occam&#x27;s razor. Prior to the advent of computer programming, generating such descriptions was the intellectual labor of scientific theorists. It was far less formal than it has become in the computer age. If two scientists had a theoretic disagreement, they rarely could &quot;formally&quot; apply Occam&#x27;s razor to choose between their theories. They would have different data sets and possibly different descriptive languages. Nevertheless, science advanced as Occam&#x27;s razor was an informal guide in deciding which model was best.

With the advent of formal languages and computer programming Occam&#x27;s razor was mathematically defined. Models of a given set of observations, encoded as bits of data, could be created in the form of computer programs that output that data. Occam&#x27;s razor could then &quot;formally&quot; select the shortest program, measured in bits of this &quot;algorithmic information&quot;, as the best model.

To avoid confusion, note that there is nothing in the MDL principle that implies a machine produced the program embodying the model. It can be entirely the product of humans. The MDL principle applies regardless of whether the description to be run on a computer is the product of humans, machines or any combination thereof. The MDL principle requires &quot;only&quot; that the shortest description, when executed, produce the original data set without error.

===Two-Part codes===

The distinction in computer programs between programs and literal data applies to all formal descriptions and is sometimes referred to as &quot;two parts&quot;&quot; of a description. In statistical MDL learning, such a description is frequently called a &quot;two-part code&quot;.

==MDL in machine learning==

MDL applies in machine learning when algorithms (machines) generate descriptions. Learning occurs when an algorithm generates a shorter description of the same data set.

The theoretic minimum description length of a data set, called its Kolmogorov complexity, cannot, however, be computed. That is to say, even if by random chance an algorithm generates the shortest program of all that outputs the data set, an automated theorem prover cannot prove there is no shorter such program. Nevertheless, given two programs that output the dataset, the MDL principle selects the shorter of the two as embodying the best model.

==Recent work on algorithmic MDL learning==

Recent machine MDL learning of algorithmic, as opposed to statistical, data models have received increasing attention with increasing availability of data, computation resources and theoretic advances. Approaches are informed by the burgeoning field of artificial general intelligence. Shortly before his death, Marvin Minsky came out strongly in favor of this line of research, saying:

==Statistical MDL learning==

Any set of data can be represented by a string of symbols from a finite (say, binary) alphabet.
[The MDL Principle] is based on the following insight: any regularity in a given set of data can be used to compress the data, i.e. to describe it using fewer symbols than needed to describe the data literally. (Grünwald, 2004)
Based on this, in 1978, Jorma Rissanen published an MDL learning algorithm using the statistical notion of information rather than algorithmic information. Over the past 40 years this has developed into a rich theory of statistical and machine learning procedures with connections to Bayesian model selection and averaging, penalization methods such as Lasso and Ridge, and so on - Grünwald and Roos (2020) give an introduction including all modern developments. Rissanen started out with this idea: all statistical learning is about finding regularities in data, and the best hypothesis to describe the regularities in data is also the one that is able to &quot;statistically&quot; compress the data most. Like other statistical methods, it can be used for learning the parameters of a model using some data. Usually though, standard statistical methods assume that the general form of a model is fixed. MDL&#x27;s main strength is that it can also be used for selecting the general form of a model and its parameters. The quantity of interest (sometimes just a model, sometimes just parameters, sometimes both at the same time) is called a hypothesis. The basic idea is then to consider the (lossless) &quot;two-stage code&quot; that encodes data formula_1 with length formula_2 by first encoding a hypothesis formula_3 in the set of considered hypotheses formula_4 and then coding formula_1 &quot;with the help of&quot; formula_3; in the simplest context this just means &quot;encoding the deviations of the data from the predictions made by formula_3:

formula_8

The formula_3 achieving this minimum is then viewed as the best explanation of data formula_1. As a simple example, take a regression problem: the data formula_1 could consist of a sequence of points formula_12, the set formula_13 could be the set of all polynomials from formula_14 to formula_15. To describe a polynomial formula_3 of degree (say) formula_17, one would first have to discretize the parameters to some precision; one would then have to describe this precision (a natural number); next, one would have to describe the degree formula_17 (another natural number), and in the final step, one would have to describe formula_19 parameters; the total length would be formula_20. One would then describe the points in formula_1 using some fixed code for the x-values and then using a code for the formula_22 deviations formula_23.

In practice, one often (but not always) uses a &quot;probabilistic model&quot;. For example, one associates each polynomial formula_3 with the corresponding conditional distribution expressing that given formula_14, formula_15 is normally distributed with mean formula_27 and some variance formula_28 which could either be fixed or added as a free parameter. Then the set of hypotheses formula_4 reduces to the assumption of a linear model, formula_30 , with formula_3 a polynomial.

Furthermore, one is often not directly interested in specific parameters values, but just, for example, the &quot;degree&quot; of the polynomial. In that case, one sets formula_4 to be formula_33where each formula_34 represents the hypothesis that the data is best described as a j-th degree polynomial. One then codes data formula_1 given hypothesis formula_34 using a &quot;one-part code&quot; designed such that, whenever &quot;some&quot; hypothesis formula_37 fits the data well, the codelength formula_38 is short. The design of such codes is called universal coding. There are various types of universal codes one could use, often giving similar lengths for long data sequences but differing for short ones. The &#x27;best&#x27; (in the sense that it has a minimax optimality property) are the &quot;normalized maximum likelihood&quot; (NML) or &quot;Shtarkov&quot; codes. A quite useful class of codes are the &quot;Bayesian marginal likelihood codes.&quot; For exponential families of distributions, when Jeffreys prior is used and the parameter space is suitably restricted, these asymptotically coincide with the NML codes; this brings MDL theory in close contact with objective Bayes model selection, in which one also sometimes adopts Jeffreys&#x27; prior, albeit for different reasons. The MDL approach to model selection &quot;gives a selection criterion formally identical to the BIC approach&quot; for large number of samples.

===Example of Statistical MDL Learning===

A coin is flipped 1000 times, and the numbers of heads and tails are recorded. Consider two model classes: 
*The first is a code that represents outcomes with a 0 for heads or a 1 for tails. This code represents the hypothesis that the coin is fair. The code length according to this code is always exactly 1000 bits.
*The second consists of all codes that are efficient for a coin with some specific bias, representing the hypothesis that the coin is not fair. Say that we observe 510 heads and 490 tails. Then the code length according to the best code in the second model class is shorter than 1000 bits.

For this reason, a naive statistical method might choose the second model as a better explanation for the data. However, an MDL approach would construct a single code based on the hypothesis, instead of just using the best one. This code could be the normalized maximum likelihood code or a Bayesian code. If such a code is used, then the total codelength based on the second model class would be larger than 1000 bits. Therefore, the conclusion when following an MDL approach is inevitably that there is not enough evidence to support the hypothesis of the biased coin, even though the best element of the second model class provides better fit to the data.

===Statistical MDL Notation===
Central to MDL theory is the one-to-one correspondence between code length functions and probability distributions (this follows from the Kraft–McMillan inequality). For any probability distribution formula_39, it is possible to construct a code formula_40 such that the length (in bits) of formula_41 is equal to formula_42; this code minimizes the expected code length. Conversely, given a code formula_40, one can construct a probability distribution formula_39 such that the same holds. (Rounding issues are ignored here.) In other words, searching for an efficient code is equivalent to searching for a good probability distribution.

===Limitations of Statistical MDL Learning===
The description language of statistical MDL is not computationally universal. Therefore it cannot, even in principle, learn models of recursive natural processes.

===Related concepts===
Statistical MDL learning is very strongly connected to probability theory and statistics through the correspondence between codes and probability distributions mentioned above. This has led some researchers to view MDL as equivalent to Bayesian inference: code length of model and data together in MDL correspond respectively to prior probability and marginal likelihood in the Bayesian framework.

While Bayesian machinery is often useful in constructing efficient MDL codes, the MDL framework also accommodates other codes that are not Bayesian. An example is the Shtarkov &quot;normalized maximum likelihood code&quot;, which plays a central role in current MDL theory, but has no equivalent in Bayesian inference. Furthermore, Rissanen stresses that we should make no assumptions about the &quot;true&quot; data-generating process: in practice, a model class is typically a simplification of reality and thus does not contain any code or probability distribution that is true in any objective sense. In the last mentioned reference Rissanen bases the mathematical underpinning of MDL on the Kolmogorov structure function.

According to the MDL philosophy, Bayesian methods should be dismissed if they are based on unsafe priors that would lead to poor results. The priors that are acceptable from an MDL point of view also tend to be favored in so-called objective Bayesian analysis; there, however, the motivation is usually different.

==Other systems==
Rissanen&#x27;s was not the first information-theoretic approach to learning; as early as 1968 Wallace and Boulton pioneered a related concept called minimum message length (MML). The difference between MDL and MML is a source of ongoing confusion. Superficially, the methods appear mostly equivalent, but there are some significant differences, especially in interpretation:
* MML is a fully subjective Bayesian approach: it starts from the idea that one represents one&#x27;s beliefs about the data-generating process in the form of a prior distribution. MDL avoids assumptions about the data-generating process.
* Both methods make use of &quot;two-part codes&quot;: the first part always represents the information that one is trying to learn, such as the index of a model class (model selection) or parameter values (parameter estimation); the second part is an encoding of the data given the information in the first part. The difference between the methods is that, in the MDL literature, it is advocated that unwanted parameters should be moved to the second part of the code, where they can be represented with the data by using a so-called one-part code, which is often more efficient than a &quot;two-part code&quot;. In the original description of MML, all parameters are encoded in the first part, so all parameters are learned.
* Within the MML framework, each parameter is stated to exactly the precision which results in the optimal overall message length: the preceding example might arise if some parameter was originally considered &quot;possibly useful&quot; to a model but was subsequently found to be unable to help to explain the data (such a parameter will be assigned a code length corresponding to the (Bayesian) prior probability that the parameter would be found to be unhelpful). In the MDL framework, the focus is more on comparing model classes than models, and it is more natural to approach the same question by comparing the class of models that explicitly include such a parameter against some other class that doesn&#x27;t. The difference lies in the machinery applied to reach the same conclusion.

<doc id="331326" wikidata="Q5532199" url="?curid=331326" title="General Six-Principle Baptists">
<text>The Six-Principle Baptists is a Baptist Christian denomination in United States.

==History==
The history of General Six-Principle Baptists in America began in Rhode Island in 1652 when the historic First Baptist Church, once associated with Roger Williams, split. The occasion was the development within the congregation of an Arminian majority who held to the six principles of Hebrew 6:1–2: repentance from dead works, faith toward God, the doctrine of baptisms, the laying-on of hands, resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. Of these, the laying-on of hands was the only doctrine really distinctive to this body, and that only because it was advocated as mandatory. This rite was used at the baptism and reception of new members symbolizing the reception of the gifts of the Holy Spirit. Some Calvinistic Baptist churches were also &quot;Six-Principle,&quot; but they did not survive as a separate body. Even the influential Philadelphia Baptist Association (org. 1707) added an article concerning laying-on of hands to their 1742 reprint of the 1689 London Baptist Confession. A distinguishing feature of these &quot;General&quot; Six-Principle Baptists was that they would not commune with other Baptists who did not observe the laying-on of hands. In 1656, members left the First Baptist Church in Newport, the church of John Clarke and Obadiah Holmes, and formed a second Six-Principle Baptist Church.
Churches were planted and conferences rose up in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania. The Rhode Island Yearly Meeting was formed in 1670, becoming the first Baptist association in America. It was incorporated in 1895 as the General Six-Principle Baptist Conference of Rhode Island. The word &quot;Hope&quot; and the emblem of the anchor (both taken from Hebrews 6) on the flag and Seal of Rhode Island attest to the historical influence of Six-Principle Baptists in that state. The New York Yearly Conference was organized around 1824. After 1865, it became known as the General Six-Principle Baptist Association of Pennsylvania. The Six-Principle Baptists of New England were called &quot;General&quot;, distinguishing that they held the general view of Christ&#x27;s atonement (making salvation possible for all men) rather than the particular view (that he atoned for the elect only).

Six-Principle Baptists also existed in England, probably pre-dating those in America. The Standard Confession of 1660 specifies the doctrine of laying-on of hands. According to Henry Vedder,

In 1954, the Rhode Island Conference lifted their ban on communing with other Christians, preparing the way for their assimilation into the broader Baptist community. One of the last historical churches to survive is the Stony Lane Six Principle Baptist Church in North Kingstown, Rhode Island. As late as 2009 their pastor, Rev. John Wheeler, wrote &quot;We keep the name only for historical purposes and to our knowledge we are the last church to use it in our official name. We don&#x27;t include it in our stationery etc., nor do we hold to the specific teaching of highlighting Hebrews 6:1–2 over other parts of Scripture.&quot; However, in 2022 they no longer include any mention of &quot;Six Principle&quot; on the church website. According to Albert Wardin, there is also &quot;one church, located in Pennsylvania, which still carries Six Principle in its name, but its current pastor does not observe all the six principles.&quot; The Pine Grove Church of Nicholson, Pennsylvania and the Stony Lane Church were the last two churches to be considered historically Six-Principle Baptist.

==Reorganization==

Saddened by the dissolution of the historic Six-Principle denomination, a small group of Baptist ministers began a reorganization of the movement in 2001. This incorporated reorganization movement was officially renamed on July 10, 2003, as the General Association of Six-Principle Baptist Churches, Inc.; the denomination is based in Alabama. It is also known as the General Association of Six-Principle Baptists which is more descriptive of the fact that the General Association includes not only churches, but individuals, ministers, and ministries.

Since its reorganization, the denomination has grown steadily. All of the ministers credentialed by the General Association serve as Missionaries of the General Association. The General Association of Six-Principle Baptist Churches has no direct historical connection to the original body of Six-Principle Baptists.

==Beliefs==
The &quot;six-principles&quot; adhered to are those listed in :
* Repentance
* Faith
* Baptism
* Laying on of hands
* Resurrection of the dead
* Final judgment

<doc id="331330" wikidata="Q1819478" url="?curid=331330" title="Rehabilitation (neuropsychology)">
<text>Rehabilitation of sensory and cognitive function typically involves methods for retraining neural pathways or training new neural pathways to regain or improve neurocognitive functioning that have been diminished by disease or trauma. The main objective outcome for rehabilitation is to assist in regaining physical abilities and improving performance.
Three common neuropsychological problems treatable with rehabilitation are attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), concussion, and spinal cord injury. Rehabilitation research and practices are a fertile area for clinical neuropsychologists, rehabilitation psychologists, and others.

==Methods==
Physical therapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy, hot and cold therapy, and other methods that &quot;exercise&quot; specific brain functions are used. For example, eye–hand coordination exercises may rehabilitate certain motor deficits, or well-structured planning and organizing exercises might help rehabilitate executive functions following a traumatic blow to the head.

Brain functions that are impaired because of traumatic brain injuries are often the most challenging and difficult to rehabilitate. Much work is being done in nerve regeneration for the most severely damaged neural pathways.

Neurocognitive techniques, such as cognitive rehabilitation therapy, provide assessment and treatment of cognitive impairments from a variety of brain diseases and insults that cause persistent disability for many individuals. Such disabilities result in a loss of independence, a disruption in normal childhood activities and social relationships, and a loss in school attendance and educational and employment opportunities. Injuries or insults that may benefit from neurocognitive rehabilitation include traumatic and acquired brain injuries (e.g., stroke, concussion, neurosurgery, etc.), cranial radiation, intrathecal chemotherapy, and neurological disorders, such as ADHD. The rehabilitation targets cognitive functions such as attention, memory, and executive function (organization, planning, time management, etc.). Specific programs are tailored to develop and address an individual&#x27;s challenges after a baseline assessment of abilities and challenges.

==Concussion==
Much research and focus has been given to concussion suffered frequently by athletes. While the severity of brain trauma has been standardized for immediate &quot;sideline&quot; assessment, much work needs to be done to understand how to rehabilitate or accelerate the rehabilitation of athletes&#x27; brain function following serious concussion—whether consciousness is lost or a dazed/confused feeling is experienced or not. Currently, rehabilitation of concussive brain injury is based on rest and gradual return to normal activities with as much involvement as can be tolerated.
== Methods &amp; Tools ==

; Standardized neuropsychological tests
: These tasks have been designed so the performance on the task can be linked to specific neurocognitive processes. These tests are typically standardized, meaning that they have been administered to a specific group (or groups) of individuals before being used in individual clinical cases. The data resulting from standardization are known as normative data. After these data have been collected and analyzed, they are used as the comparative standard against which individual performances can be compared. Examples of neuropsychological tests include: the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS), the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), Boston Naming Test, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, the Benton Visual Retention Test, and the Controlled Oral Word Association.

; Brain scans
: The use of brain scans to investigate the structure or function of the brain is common, either as simply a way of better assessing brain injury with high resolution pictures, or by examining the relative activations of different brain areas. Such technologies may include fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) and positron emission tomography (PET), which yields data related to functioning, as well as MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and computed axial tomography (CAT or CT), which yields structural data.

; Global Brain Project
: Brain models based on mouse and monkey have been developed based on theoretical neuroscience involving working memory and attention, while mapping brain activity based on time constants validated by measurements of neuronal activity in various layers of the brain. These methods also map to decision states of behavior in simple tasks that involve binary outcomes.

; Electrophysiology
: The use of electrophysiological measures designed to measure the activation of the brain by measuring the electrical or magnetic field produced by the nervous system. This may include electroencephalography (EEG) or magneto-encephalography (MEG).

; Experimental tasks
: The use of designed experimental tasks, often controlled by computer and typically measuring reaction time and accuracy on a particular tasks thought to be related to a specific neurocognitive process. An example of this is the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) or CNS Vital Signs (CNSVS).

<doc id="331331" wikidata="Q128473" url="?curid=331331" title="Auguste Regnaud de Saint-Jean d'Angély">
<text>Auguste Michel Étienne Regnaud de Saint-Jean d&#x27;Angély, later 2nd Count Regnaud de Saint-Jean d&#x27;Angély (30 July 1794 – 1 February 1870), was a Marshal of France, soldier and politician.

==Biography==
Auguste was the illegitimate son of Michel-Louis-Étienne, Count Regnaud de Saint-Jean d&#x27;Angély, and of his mistress Marie-Louise Chenié, who died shortly after his birth, he was recognised by his father some months later and adopted by the latter&#x27;s wife in 1795.

Regnaud served as a lieutenant in a regiment of hussars during the campaign of Saxe in 1813. He fought at the Battle of Leipzig, after which he became a member of Emperor Napoleon&#x27;s personal military staff.

As he had served as a personal &quot;officier d&#x27;ordonnance&quot; to the Emperor at Waterloo, he was dismissed from the army by the Restoration government with the rank of lieutenant. In 1825, he went to Greece, fought in the war of independence and was in charge of the instruction of a cavalry corps in the new Greek army. In 1828, he took part in the Morea expedition of the French army as an interpreter. He was promoted to the rank of captain in 1829.

During the July Monarchy, Regnaud de Saint-Jean d&#x27;Angély served as a colonel in the expedition to Belgium. He was promoted to &quot;général de brigade&quot; in 1841 and to &quot;général de division&quot; in 1849. In 1848, he was elected deputy and sat on the right. In 1851, he served for a fortnight as minister of war. In 1852, he backed Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte and, as a reward, he was made a senator for life. Under the Second Empire, he went through the Crimean and Italian campaigns, and ultimately was created Marshal of France in 1859 for bravery at the Battle of Magenta.

==Family==
Marshal Regnaud de Saint-Jean d&#x27;Angély married Anne-Angélique Ruby, who bore him no children. He adopted her daughter from a previous marriage, Flore-Angélique Regnaud de Saint-Jean d&#x27;Angély.

Since his father never married his mother (who died some months after the redaction of a marriage contract), Regnaud de Saint-Jean d&#x27;Angély had not been able to succeed to his title of count. Notwithstanding, Napoléon III granted him the title again in November 1864, with the special permission to pass it at his death to the husband of his adoptive daughter, Edmond Davillier. The latter took the surname &quot;Davillier-Regnaud de Saint-Jean-d&#x27;Angély&quot; and was confirmed in the succession of the title of count at the death of his father-in-law. However, it became extinct at his own death in 1908 since he had only a daughter from his marriage with the Marshal&#x27;s stepdaughter.

Marshal Regnaud de Saint-Jean d&#x27;Angély died in Cannes in 1870 and was buried in the &quot;Hôtel des Invalides&quot; in Paris.

<text>The Carnegie Prize is an international art prize awarded by the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It currently consists of a $10,000 cash prize accompanied by a gold medal.

==History==
The Carnegie Prize was established in 1896, to recognize the best painting shown in the first annual exhibition of the Museum of Art, Carnegie Institute. Unlike most American annual exhibitions, which were limited to artists born or resident in the United States, the Carnegie exhibitions were international. To attract top painters from home and abroad, the Carnegie exhibitions offered high cash prizes—$1,500 for the First Class winner, $1,000 for the Second-Class winner and $500 for the Third-Class winner. The First-Class winner&#x27;s cash prize was accompanied by the &quot;Carnegie Gold Medal of Honor&quot; (1896), designed by Tiffany &amp; Co. and cast by J.E. Caldwell &amp; Co. Often, especially in the early years, the prize-winning painting was purchased for the museum&#x27;s permanent collection.

The exhibition has undergone a series of name changes and transformations—adding a gold medal for sculpture (beginning in 1958), and going from a schedule of every year to every second or third year, and now, to every fourth or fifth year. The exhibitions in the late 1970s were retrospectives of established artists. In 1982, the exhibition was renamed the Carnegie International, and returned to its original mission of showing recent works by a host of artists. In 1985, the Carnegie Prize was refocused to recognize not just a single work of art but an honoree&#x27;s entire body of work. In the 1990s, the exhibition expanded to include non-traditional artists and filmmakers.

As of 2019, 67 Carnegie Prizes had been awarded and one was refused (Irish painter Francis Bacon, 1967). The Spanish sculptor Eduardo Chillida was awarded it twice (1964 for an individual sculpture, 1979 for his body of work). American painter Cecilia Beaux was the first woman awarded the Carnegie Prize (1899); German sculptor Rebecca Horn was the second woman (1988). South African artist William Kentridge was the first filmmaker awarded it (1999). Documenta, the German contemporary art exhibition, was the only organization awarded the prize (1979). English artist Lynette Yiadom-Boakye was the first woman of color awarded the prize (2018).

The Carnegie International&#x27;s prize should not be confused with the Carnegie Prize of the National Academy of Design, the Carnegie Prize of the Society of American Artists, the Carnegie Art Award (Sweden), or with the Carnegie Medal (literary award).

<text>Michel Louis Etienne Regnaud, later 1st Count Regnaud de Saint-Jean d&#x27;Angély (3 December 1761, Saint-Fargeau – 11 March 1819, Paris) was a French politician.

==Biography==

===Early activities===
He was a lawyer in Paris and lieutenant of the maritime provostship of Rochefort. With the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789, he was elected deputy to the Estates-General by the Third Estate in the &quot;sénéchaussée&quot; of Saint-Jean-d&#x27;Angély.

His eloquence made him a prominent figure in the National Constituent Assembly, where he boldly attacked Honoré Mirabeau, and settled the dispute about the ashes of Voltaire by decreeing that they belonged to the nation.

===Conflict with radicals===
The moderation shown by the measures he proposed at the time of King Louis XVI&#x27;s flight to Varennes, by his refusal to accede to the demands for the king&#x27;s execution, and by the articles he published in the &quot;Journal de Paris&quot; and the &quot;Ami des Patriotes&quot;, marked him out for the hostility of the radical parties.

He was arrested after the revolution of 10 August, but succeeded in escaping, and during the Thermidorian Reaction which followed the fall of Maximilien Robespierre, Regnaud de Saint-Jean d&#x27;Angély was appointed administrator of the military hospitals in Paris. His powers of organization brought him to Napoleon&#x27;s notice.

He accompanied Napoleon during the French invasion of Malta in June 1798, but he became sick and did not participate in the subsequent campaign in Egypt. Regnaud was appointed Commissioner of Government of French-occupied Malta and he was the editor of the propaganda newspaper &quot;Journal de Malte&quot; before returning to France in November 1798. The following year, he took part in the 18 Brumaire Coup (9 November 1799).

===Empire and later life===
Under the Empire, he enjoyed the confidence of Napoleon Bonaparte, and was made councillor of state, president of election in the &quot;Conseil d&#x27;État&quot;, member of the Académie française, &quot;procureur général&quot; of the high court, and was created Count Regnaud de Saint-Jean d&#x27;Angély in 1808.

He was dismissed on the first Bourbon Restoration, but resumed his posts during the Hundred Days, and, after the battle of Waterloo, persuaded the Emperor Napoleon to abdicate. He was exiled by the government of the Second Restoration, but subsequently obtained leave to return to France. He died on the day of his return to Paris. His supposed memoirs, &quot;Les Souvenirs du Comte Regnault de St Jean d&#x27;Angély&quot; (Paris, 1817), are spurious.

==Family==
Regnaud had married in 1795 Laure Guesnon de Bonneuil, the daughter of a former Maître d&#x27;Hôtel of the Count of Artois. They had no children, but his natural son Auguste Regnaud de Saint-Jean d&#x27;Angély became Marshal of France.

<text>John Frederick Milius (; born April 11, 1944) is an American screenwriter and film director. He was a writer for the first two &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; films, received an Academy Award nomination as screenwriter of &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; (1979), and wrote and directed &quot;The Wind and the Lion&quot; (1975), &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; (1982), and &quot;Red Dawn&quot; (1984). He later served as the co-creator of the Primetime Emmy Award-winning television series &quot;Rome&quot; (2005–2007).

== Early life and education ==
Milius was born April 11, 1944, in St. Louis, Missouri, the youngest of three children to Elizabeth Marie ( Roe; 1906–2010) and William Styx Milius (1889–1975), who was a shoe manufacturer. When Milius was seven, his father sold Milius Shoe Company, which his grandfather George W. Milius had founded in 1923, and retired. He moved the family to Bel Air, California. John Milius became an enthusiastic surfer. At 14, his parents sent him to a small private school, the Lowell Whiteman School, in the mountains of Steamboat Springs, Colorado, because he &quot;was a juvenile delinquent&quot;.

Milius became a voracious reader and started to write short stories: &quot;I had learned very early, to write in almost any style. I could write in fluent Hemingway, or in fluent Melville, or Conrad, or Jack Kerouac, and whatever.&quot; He says he was also influenced by the oral story telling of surfers at the time, who had a beatnik tradition.

&quot;My religion is surfing&quot;, Milius said in 1976, adding that &quot;the other thing that influenced me throughout my youth was my involvement with things Japanese. I studied judo, kendo, and painting. I felt more comfortable with things Japanese and with Japanese people than I did with Europeans ... feudalism in any country, at any period, fascinates me ... I understand the reasoning of people in Asia, it makes sense to me. Zen is very sensible, the whole way of feeling things is logical, whereas many of the Western-motivated things—greed, business sense—I&#x27;m not comfortable with, I don&#x27;t understand their rationale.&quot;

Milius says he attempted to join the Marine Corps and volunteer for Vietnam War service in the late 1960s, but was rejected due to a &quot;chronic&quot; and &quot;sometimes disabling&quot; case of mild asthma. &quot;I&#x27;d have given anything to be a Marine&quot;, said Milius. &quot;As a surfer I&#x27;d spent a lot of time hanging out with the Marines off Pendleton, and I&#x27;d had every intention of joining up ... I was devastated, I felt like I&#x27;d been rejected as a human being.&quot; &quot;It was totally demoralizing&quot;, he said later. &quot;I missed going to my war. It probably caused me to be obsessed with war ever since.&quot; Milius said he was &quot;dying to be able to... go prove myself in battle—the same as all young men long to do, if they are honest with themselves, whether it&#x27;s right or wrong or even sane, which is a debate that&#x27;s been going on since we left the caves. Only there was no way I could found my own unit, so I did the second best, which was to write it. Every writer wishes he could actually be doing the thing he writes about.&quot; He later admitted, &quot;I don&#x27;t know how well I&#x27;d have done. I really wanted a military career, to be a general, but I had a hard time polishing shoes. And marching. I was in the ROTC once, and I hate marching ... I would have been good in the Mexican Army.&quot;

At one stage Milius considered becoming an artist or historian. During a rainy day on a summer vacation in Hawaii in 1962, he stumbled upon a movie theatre showing a week of Akira Kurosawa films and fell in love with cinema.

Milius studied film at the University of Southern California School of Cinema-Television, which he chose because it was an elitist school that trained people for Hollywood. His classmates included George Lucas, Walter Murch, Basil Poledouris, Randal Kleiser and Donald F. Glut. Milius says he was influenced by his teacher, Irwin Blacker:
He gave you the screenplay form, which I hated so much, and if you made one mistake on the form, you flunked the class. His attitude was that the least you can learn is the form. &quot;I can&#x27;t grade you on the content. I can&#x27;t tell you whether this is a better story for you to write than that, you know? And I can&#x27;t teach you how to write the content, but I can certainly demand that you do it in the proper form.&quot; He never talked about character arcs or anything like that; he simply talked about telling a good yarn, telling a good story. He said, &quot;Do whatever you need to do. Be as radical and as outrageous as you can be. Take any kind of approach you want to take. Feel free to flash back, feel free to flash forward, feel free to flash back in the middle of a flashback. Feel free to use narration, all the tools are there for you to use.&quot;
Milius says his writing style was influenced by two novels in particular, &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; and &quot;On the Road&quot;:
I think &quot;Moby Dick&quot; is the best work of art ever made ... I used to point out the dramatic entrance of characters, how they were threaded through ... &quot;Moby Dick&quot; was a perfect screenplay, a perfect example of the kind of drama that I was interested in. Another great influence on me was ... &quot;On the Road&quot;, which has no tight, linear narrative, but sprawls, following this character. &quot;Moby Dick&quot; and &quot;On the Road&quot; are completely different kinds of novels, yet they&#x27;re both extremely disciplined. Nothing happens by accident in either of those two books.
Milius reflected his &quot;ambitions stopped at B Westerns ... I thought that was a good life. I never wanted to be Hitchcock or some big mogul, I didn&#x27;t want to be Louis B. Mayer. I wanted to be ... Budd Boetticher or something ... John Ford.&quot;
His short films at film school included &quot;The Reversal of Richard Sun&quot; (1966), &quot;Glut&quot; (1967) and &quot;Viking Women Don&#x27;t Care&quot; (1967). He wrote a documentary, &quot;The Emperor&quot; (1967), directed by classmate George Lucas, who also edited an animated short Milius directed called &quot;Marcello, I&#x27;m So Bored&quot; (1967) with John Strawbridge.

&quot;Marcello&quot;, Milius&#x27;s thesis film, won best animation at the National Student Film Festival and screened around the country in various festivals; it was praised by Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Milius received a job offer to work in animation but he turned it down as he could not see himself &quot;sitting there drawing cell after cell.&quot;

==Career==
=== Early ===
Milius&#x27;s first completed script was &quot;Los Gringos&quot; (1968). &quot;It actually wasn&#x27;t bad&quot;, he later said. &quot;It was sort of like &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; ... there was a lot of killing and shooting and riding and dust ... sombreros. ... It was a pretty good idea, actually. It had everything, and it was certainly as original as &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;, but it wasn&#x27;t as skillfully written as later stuff.&quot;

He followed this with &quot;The Last Resort&quot; which was optioned by Michael S Laughlin in 1969. Milius says, &quot;Neither of them were ever made, but I was able to option them. I had them rented out for like $5,000 a year.&quot;

==== &quot;The Devil&#x27;s 8&quot; ====
Milius then got a summer job working at the story department of American International Pictures through a student colleague of his who had begun working there, Willard Huyck. Huyck and Milius worked at AIP under producer Larry Gordon, reading scripts. They eventually collaborated on a rewrite of the screenplay for &quot;The Devil&#x27;s 8&quot; (1968), an action drama about moonshine drivers which ripped off &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; (1968).

Milius&#x27;s name had been mentioned in a 1968 &quot;Time&quot; magazine article about the new generation of Hollywood filmmakers, which also referred to George Lucas and Martin Scorsese. This was read by Mike Medavoy, who became Milius&#x27;s agent. Medavoy called Milius &quot;a badboy mad genius in a teenager&#x27;s body, but he was a good and fast writer with original ideas.&quot;

Milius began to get writing commissions. He wrote a script entitled &quot;The Texans&quot; for Al Ruddy at Paramount, a contemporary version of &quot;Red River&quot; (1948) (never made, although Sam Peckinpah was going to direct it in 1979)— Milius later said it &quot;wasn&#x27;t very good&quot;. He also wrote an original called &quot;Truck Driver&quot; (aka &quot;The Haul&quot;) which was purchased by Levy-Garner-Laven, although that film too was not made.

Milius later said he &quot;didn&#x27;t do a good job&quot; with these two early scripts &quot;because in both cases I was influenced by the people who had hired me. They said put this in and put that in, and I went along with it. Every time I went along with something in my whole career it usually didn&#x27;t work. Usually there&#x27;s a price to pay. You think of selling out, but there is a price to pay. Usually what people want you to do is make it current.&quot;

==== &quot;Jeremiah Johnson&quot; ====
Milius then wrote &quot;Jeremiah Johnson&quot;, a story loosely based on the life of the mountain man Liver-Eating Johnson. 

Milius later said this was &quot;the real breaking point&quot; where he knew &quot;almost overnight... that I had become a good writer with a voice.&quot;:
I knew that material. I&#x27;d lived in the mountains, I had a trapline, I hunted, and I had a lot of experiences with characters up there. So, it was real easy to write that and there was a humor to it, a kind of bigger-than-life attitude. I was inspired by Carl Sandburg. I read a lot of his poetry and it&#x27;s this kind of abrupt description—&quot;a train is coming, thundering steel, where are you going? Wichita.&quot; That great kind of feeling that he had, that&#x27;s what I was trying to do there. I remember there was a great poem about American braggarts. You know, American liars—&quot;I am the ring-tailed cousin to the such and such that ate so and so and I can do this and I can do that better than Mike Fink the river man ...&quot; I just realized that this was the voice that the script had to have. It was as clear as a bell. I knew that writing was particular to me.

Milius sold the script to Warner Bros. in 1970 for $5,000, going up to $50,000 if it was ever made. Warner Bros. had other writers work on the original script based on &quot;The Crow Killer&quot;. Milius was also called back to work on it, and his fee grew each time. (He eventually made $90,000 on the film.) Eventually, Robert Redford agreed to play the lead and Sydney Pollack signed to direct.

==== &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; and &quot;Judge Roy Bean&quot; ====
Milius wrote an uncredited draft of &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; (1971). He says his contribution to the film was &quot;A lot of guns. And the attitude of Dirty Harry, being a cop who was ruthless. I think it&#x27;s fairly obvious if you look at the rest of my work what parts are mine. The cop being the same as the killer except he has a badge. And being lonely.&quot; &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; was an enormous box office hit.

George Hamilton hired Milius to rewrite &quot;Evel Knievel&quot; (1971), a biopic of the stunt rider, at a fee of $1,000 a day. Milius re-did the entire script over seven days.

He wrote an original script, &quot;The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean&quot;, about the famous judge. He offered it for $150,000 if he could direct, but could find no takers. He sold it to First Artists for $300,000, then extremely high for a script. Directed by John Huston and starring Paul Newman, it was a moderate hit, although Milius disliked the final result. &quot;I fought every day&quot;, he said. &quot;And I was blooded well. I was treated horribly.&quot; More popular was &quot;Jeremiah Johnson&quot;.

Milius did some work with David Giler on the script which became &quot;The Black Bird&quot;. 

By now Milius was one of the most sought after screenwriters in Hollywood, seen as a colorful character with a talent for lively interviews. His self-styled &quot;Zen Anarchist&quot;/&quot;American samurai&quot; persona made him stand out in Hollywood. For instance, he rewrote &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; only on the condition that he be given an expensive gun. He was also one of the inspirations for the character of John Milner in the enormously successful &quot;American Graffiti&quot; (1973). Milius said of this film, &quot;I guess he [Lucas] saw me in that light because I was a surfer going past my time.&quot;

He also wrote the first draft of the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; sequel, &quot;Magnum Force&quot; (1973). Milius later said &quot;I don&#x27;t like &quot;Magnum Force&quot;. Of all the films I had anything to do with, I like it least. They changed a lot of things in a cheap and distasteful manner.&quot; It was however successful at the box office.

==== &quot;Dillinger&quot; ====
Milius wanted to move behind the camera. &quot;Being a director is the only way anyone will listen to you in Hollywood&quot;, he said. &quot;It&#x27;s the next best thing to being a star.&quot;

Gangster films were popular at the time and AIP offered him the chance to direct one if he would write it for a fraction of his regular fee. Milius agreed and wrote and directed &quot;Dillinger&quot; (1973). &quot;I deliberately chose Dillinger because he was a pure criminal&quot;, said Milius. &quot;Robbing banks to right social wrongs did not come into it.&quot;

The movie was moderately successful and launched Milius&#x27;s directing career. He worked on the script for a TV sequel, &quot;Melvin Purvis: G-Man&quot; (1974), a pilot for a proposed series about Melvin Purvis (there was a second TV movie, but no series), but did not like the director, Dan Curtis, or the experience of working for TV.

Contemporary film critics grouped Milius in with the emerging &quot;movie brats&quot; generation of filmmakers that also including Lucas, Coppola, Terrence Malick, and Scorsese.

In 1974, David Picker announced he would produce &quot;Ranch Life and the Hunting Trail&quot; directed by Milius and written by Winfred Blevins, about Theodore Roosevelt. The film was never made. Neither was &quot;The Life and Times of Joe McCarthy&quot;, a proposed biopic about the famous anti-Communist Senator, which Milius declared interest in making.

==== &quot;The Wind and the Lion&quot; ====
Milius next wrote and directed the popular adventure film &quot;The Wind and the Lion&quot; (1975), which starred Sean Connery and Candice Bergen. He later said he felt this was his first &quot;real&quot; movie.

He intended to follow this with &quot;Give Your Heart to the Hawks&quot;, a story about mountain man Jedediah Smith in the 1820s based on the novel by Winfred Blevins &quot;It&#x27;s my interpretation of Jedediah Smith, which might not be exactly historical&quot;, said Milius. &quot;It&#x27;ll be about exploration, about the need to see what&#x27;s over the next ridge and what that does, what price you pay, to find out. Like Dirty Harry, Smith is a classic lone man, with a searing loneliness about him. A leader of men is always alone.&quot; It was never made; neither was &quot;Man-Eaters of Kumoan&quot; (1976) based on book by Jim Corbett about a tiger hunter in India which Milius worked on.

For several years, he developed with Stanley Kubrick an adaptation of &quot;Night Drop&quot; by S. L. A. Marshall. &quot;We talked about it for years and years and worked on it for a long time, but we never did it.&quot;

Milius did come close to making &quot;Extreme Prejudice&quot;, based on his script, in 1976. However he decided to make &quot;Big Wednesday&quot; instead; &quot;Extreme Prejudice&quot; would be made a decade later, much rewritten, and directed by Walter Hill.

==== &quot;Big Wednesday&quot; and the A Team ====
In 1975, Milius formed his own production company, The A Team, with Buzz Feitshans, who had edited &quot;Dillinger&quot;. They had a five-year deal with Warner Bros.. Milius said, &quot;Our motto is Civitas Sine Prudentia, which really translates to Social Irresponsibility; I believe in it. It&#x27;s refreshing, it&#x27;s liberating. Americans are basically socially irresponsible ... Who else would have invented the atomic bomb quite the same way? The Nazis would have invented it with the desire to conquer the world; we were the only people that could have invented it with the desire not to conquer the world&quot;

Its first production was an autobiographical surfing picture, &quot;Big Wednesday&quot; (1978), which he called &quot;a surfing &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot;&quot;. This was a major commercial disappointment although it has gone on to be a cult film. Milius&#x27;s friendship with George Lucas saw him given a percentage of the profits for &quot;Star Wars&quot;, which Mike Medavoy estimated earned Milius $1.5 million—in exchange Milius gave Lucas a percentage of the profits for &quot;Big Wednesday&quot; which amounted to virtually nothing.

In 1979, Milius said &quot;the ultimate aim of the A Team is that it will become a company that makes lots of projects. I shall be the figurehead and the father figure and take a percentage and I won&#x27;t have to do anything except go off and direct my movie once every three years.&quot;

The A Team made a number of movies not directed by Milius. Notably, they produced the first three films from Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale: &quot;I Wanna Hold Your Hand&quot;, &quot;1941&quot; (directed by Steven Spielberg), and &quot;Used Cars&quot;. He also produced &quot;Hardcore&quot;, directed by friend Paul Schrader.

Schrader once described Milius&#x27;s writing as containing too many good lines and scenes. He says Warren Beatty once &quot;told John something I&#x27;ve been telling him too: &#x27;You come too soon and you come too often.&#x27;... He&#x27;s so full of juice he just can&#x27;t stop coming, rather than holding back and tightening the situation and building characters. That releasing diffuses the energy, the characters are too broad because they never have time to build up the inner strength.&quot;

==== &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; ====
Milius says he was offered $17,000 to rewrite &quot;Skin Game&quot; (1971) but then Francis Ford Coppola made a competing offer of $15,000 for Milius to write &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;. &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; was an adaptation of &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; set in the Vietnam War which George Lucas intended to direct as a follow-up to his first feature &quot;THX 1138&quot; (1971). Milius says Coppola:

Offered that wonderful fork in the road where I could go do my own thing rather than just rewrite some piece of crap that would probably be rewritten by somebody else. That was the most important decision I made in my life as a writer. That sort of steered me onto the path of doing my own work and being a little more like a novelist ... I tackled an unpopular subject that no one was going to make a movie about where the chances were really slim that I could pull it off. There was no book, nothing but me and the blank page. And that was wonderful because I had followed my heart. One of the nicest times in my life was writing &quot;Apocalypse Now.&quot;

The commercial failure of &quot;THX 1138&quot; delayed production plans for &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;. Milius later said of the &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; script, &quot;No one would touch it because of the Vietnam War. Everyone loved it, it did more for my career than any other script because it was always considered a work of genius; from the minute it came out, it really stirred people up. It&#x27;s a good script, it&#x27;s certainly no work of genius. It churns people up, and that&#x27;s what they think works of genius are supposed to do.&quot;

However, the following year saw the release of &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, directed by Francis Ford Coppola. Coppola rewrote the script, which Milius disliked. &quot;He wanted to ruin it, liberalize it, and turn it into &quot;Hair&quot;&quot;, said Milius in 1976. &quot;He sees himself as a great humanitarian, an enlightened soul who will tell you such wonderful things as he does at the end of &quot;Godfather 2&quot; -- that crime doesn&#x27;t pay ... Talent-wise, he&#x27;s no John Ford; character-wise, he&#x27;s no Steve Spielberg. Francis can&#x27;t stand to have any other creative influence around ... Francis Coppola has this compelling desire to save humanity when the man is a raving fascist, the Bay Area Mussolini.&quot;

The film was released in 1979 to great acclaim.

Milius&#x27;s old agent, Mike Medavoy, helped establish Orion Pictures in 1978 and one of their first movies was going to be &quot;East of Suez&quot;, written and directed by Milius. It was not made.

Spielberg said in 1978 that Milius was key to the group of young filmmakers known as the New Hollywood, which included himself, Lucas, and Coppola:

John is our Scoutmaster. He&#x27;s the one who will tell you to go on a trip and only take enough food, enough water for one day, and make you stay out longer than that. He&#x27;s the one who says, &quot;Be a man. I don&#x27;t want to see any tears.&quot; He&#x27;s a terrific raconteur, a wonderful story teller. John has more life than all the rest of us put together.

(Quentin Tarantino said he could imagine the film &quot;Deliverance&quot; being about &quot;Hollywood filmmakers: you can imagine Spielberg, Lucas, and Scorsese as the husbands. And you can really imagine John Milius as Lewis.&quot;)

==== 1980s ====
In 1982, Milius directorial effort &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; was released, based on the fantasy novel by the same name. The film is credited for turning its lead, Arnold Schwarzenegger, into a star. Milius was interested in the project since the late 1970s. While he was about to get hired for scripting duties, he had to pass due to his commitment to &quot;Big Wednesday&quot;. Instead, Oliver Stone was hired to write the project. Eventually, producer Dino De Laurentiis with whom Milius had contractual obligations joined the project. Milius returned to the project as its director re-working Stone&#x27;s script. Upon its release the film was popular. The film was the 15th highest grossing film in the USA that year, making $39,565,475 domestically.

In 1983, he was among the producers of Ted Kotcheff&#x27;s &quot;Uncommon Valor,&quot; and credited as a &quot;spiritual adviser&quot; in the action film &quot;Lone Wolf McQuade&quot;. 

In 1984, he directed the popular action film, &quot;Red Dawn.&quot; The film is about a Russian invasion in the United States, and a rogue commando group of teenagers standing up to the invaders. Some critics perceived it to be &quot;warmongering propaganda&quot; while Milius said it was &quot;anti-war&quot;. The film was the 19th highest grossing film in the USA that year, making $38,376,497 domestically.

He wrote and directed an episode for &quot;The New Twilight Zone&quot; (1985) and a story of his, &quot;Viking Bikers from Hell&quot;, was used in an episode of &quot;Miami Vice&quot; (season 3, episode 22).

In 1986, it was reported that he was writing the script for &quot;Fatal Beauty&quot; which he hoped to direct with Cher; the film was made by Tom Holland and starred Whoopi Goldberg.

There was some talk that he would direct a movie for HBO, &quot;Capone&quot;, but it was not made.

In the late 1980s Milius wrote and directed a Pacific War adventure film &quot;Farewell to the King&quot; (1989). This flopped at the box office. In 1989, he tried to get funding for adaptations of Allan W. Eckert&#x27;s &quot;The Frontiersmen: A Narrative&quot;, about settling the Ohio River Valley, and &quot;Half of the Sky&quot;, about a Rocky Mountains explorer.

Sean Connery was hired to star in the film &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; for producer Mace Neufeld, based on Tom Clancy&#x27;s novel of the same name. Connery thought the script was &quot;too American&quot; and insisted Neufeld hire John Milius to rewrite the Russian sequences. Connery thought with Milius, he could &quot;get a different sort of image, different speech patterns.&quot;

Neufeld then hired Milius to write and direct &quot;Flight of the Intruder&quot;, based on the book by Stephen Coonts. It too was not a financial success.

&quot;I think the culture had changed and that is why my films were less accepted&quot;, he reflected later. &quot;I still think those are also great films, &quot;Farewell to the King&quot; especially.&quot;

=== Later ===
==== 1990s: screenwriting, cable TV ====
In 1992, Milius claimed that he was blacklisted for his conservative beliefs in liberal Hollywood, saying that his flops were not as forgiven as those from more leftist directors. &quot;It weighs ten times heavier against me&quot;, he said. &quot;If you don&#x27;t share the politically correct vision, then you are an outlaw, you are hunted and there is a price on your head, and if they catch you they will hang you.&quot;

The film of &quot;Hunt for the Red October&quot; had been a big success, however, and Milius remained in high demand as a screenwriter: he did several drafts of another Clancy adaptation, &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot; (1994), which was another hit.

Milius worked on a number on unfilmed scripts, including &quot;Bad Iron&quot;, a biker movie written by Kent Anderson, which he intended to produce. He was going to direct a film about Alexander the Great starring Jean-Claude Van Damme but that was put on hold when a miniseries on the same topic was made by Italian TV. He wrote &quot;Harlot&#x27;s Ghost&quot;, for Francis Ford Coppola, based on a novel by Norman Mailer; Milius described it as &quot;a cross between &quot;The Godfather&quot; and &quot;Apocalypse Now.&quot; It&#x27;s about families and duplicity and danger, but this time provoked by the government.&quot; 

He adapted the Sgt. Rock comics for producer Joel Silver, with either Renny Harlin and Paul Verhoeven attached at certain points respectively. And also wrote a version of &quot;Die Hard 3&quot;, co-written with Barry Beckerman. In the early 1990s he wrote &quot;Texas Rangers&quot;, about the establishment of that organization, for Frank Price at Columbia. He hoped to direct the film, but could not raise the funding.

In 1993, he replaced Andrei Konchalovsky as director on &quot;The Northmen&quot; for Morgan Creek Productions, about an English monk who gets captured by a band of Vikings. &quot;This was inevitable&quot;, Milius said of his directing a Viking film. &quot;I&#x27;ve been a practicing pagan for a long time. &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; was really a Viking movie but it was disguised.&quot; However, financing fell through. He was going to direct an adaptation of Tom Clancy&#x27;s novel &quot;Without Remorse&quot; with Gary Sinise and Laurence Fishburne, but the project folded in 1995, two weeks before shooting was to commence due to the financial collapse of Savoy Pictures.

A Milius script that was filmed was his biopic of Geronimo, &quot;&quot;, for Walter Hill.

He also directed two films for cable: &quot;Motorcycle Gang&quot; (1994) and &quot;Rough Riders&quot; (1997).

==== 2000s ====
In 2000, Milius was hired to work as a creative consultant with the Institute for Creative Technologies to pre-visualize the challenges to peace that America will face and the advanced virtual reality technologies necessary to train U.S. troops for the future. &quot;Through his enormous body of work, John has shown a deep understanding of the human condition and the ways that conflict can be resolved&quot;, said ICT executive director Richard Lindheim. &quot;Furthermore our efforts will benefit greatly from his vision of the world in the near future, and the techniques and procedures that will be needed to maintain security.&quot;

That year he also wrote two biopics: &quot;Le May&quot; for Robert Zemeckis, about Curtis LeMay; and &quot;Manila John&quot;, about John Basilone, which he was going to make for HBO. Warner Bros. wanted him to update &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; and he wanted them to fund a version of &quot;The Iliad&quot;; there was also talk he would make &quot;The Alamo&quot; for HBO. 

In the early 2000s he worked on &quot;King Conan: Crown of Iron&quot; (2001−02), a sequel to &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot;. Later, in 2019 Arnold Schwarzenegger met with Milius to discuss the status of the project. &quot;We&#x27;re on the same page,&quot; he said. &quot;We both want to get it done.&quot;

He also developed &quot;Jornada del Muerto&quot; (&quot;Journey of Death&quot;) (2003), a biker film starring Triple H and wrote a pilot for a TV show for UPN, &quot;Delta&quot;, about a military special ops team that takes on terrorists. None of these movies were made.

&quot;Texas Rangers&quot; (2001) was eventually made, though Milius stated that his script was substantially rewritten.

==== Financial difficulties ====
Milius suffered a major financial reversal in the late 1990s and early 2000s when his accountant embezzled from him an estimated $3 million.

He tried to get a job as a staff writer on the TV show &quot;Deadwood&quot;; showrunner David Milch was reluctant as he did not consider Milius a staff writer. Milius pleaded that he needed the money in order to pay for his son&#x27;s tuition at law school, so Milch simply paid the fees. Milius&#x27;s career recovered when he helped create the BBC/HBO television series &quot;Rome&quot;, which allowed him to repay Milch.

He wrote some pilots which did not go to series—&quot;Dodge City&quot; (circa 2005)—a Western series for CBS, and &quot;Saigon Bureau&quot; (2008)—about the AIP Bureau of photojournalists in the Vietnam War, a collaboration with Chris Noth based on the book &quot;Requiem&quot;. He also wrote a script about the Battle of Chosin Reservoir in the Korean War, &quot;The Chosin Few&quot; for Mark Cuban&#x27;s 2929 Entertainment, and &quot;The Iron Horsemen&quot;, a motorcycle feature.

==== Health problems ====
In 2010 Milius was working on a new project, a film biography of Genghis Khan, and a proposed TV series called &quot;Pharaoh&quot;, set during the reign of Queen Hatshepsut, when he had a stroke. For a while he was unable to speak or move, but ultimately he recovered.

==== Video games ====
In March 2011, Milius was a story consultant for the video game &quot;Homefront&quot; about a North Korean conquest of America.

== Influence ==
Milius has long claimed to be an outsider in Hollywood. In 2001 he stated:
I&#x27;ve always been considered a nut. They kind of tolerate me. It&#x27;s certainly affected me. I&#x27;ve been blacklisted for a large part of my career because of my politics—as surely as any writer was blacklisted back in the 1950s. It&#x27;s just that my politics are from the other side, and Hollywood always veers left.

He wrote a number of iconic film lines such as &quot;Charlie don&#x27;t surf&quot; and &quot;I love the smell of napalm in the morning&quot;, from &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, and the famous Harry Callahan one-liners delivered by Clint Eastwood, including &quot;Go ahead, make my day&quot; and &quot;Ask yourself one question, &#x27;Do I feel lucky?&#x27; Well, do you, punk?&quot; Milius also had a hand in the monologue in the film &quot;Jaws&quot;; the sequence was performed by Robert Shaw. When Spielberg asked him to contribute to the screenplay for &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, Milius suggested the opening and closing scenes at Normandy cemetery where Ryan, now an elderly hero of World War II, in a moment of survivor guilt, asks his wife &quot;Did I live a good life?&quot;

After his work on &quot;Rough Riders&quot; (1997), Milius became an instrumental force in lobbying Congress to award President Theodore Roosevelt the Medal of Honor (posthumously), for acts of conspicuous gallantry while in the Battle of San Juan Hill. Milius made two films featuring Roosevelt: &quot;The Wind and the Lion&quot; (where he was played by Brian Keith) and the made-for-TV film &quot;Rough Riders&quot; (where Tom Berenger took the role).

The character of John Milner from the 1973 George Lucas film &quot;American Graffiti&quot; was inspired in part by Milius, who was a good friend of Lucas while they were at USC film school. Likewise, the character Walter Sobchak in the 1998 film &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; (portrayed by John Goodman) was partly inspired by Milius, a friend of The Coen Brothers. The novella &quot;Blind Jozef Pronek and Dead Souls&quot; by Aleksandar Hemon features an episode with Milius, who is described as &quot;sitting at a desk sucking on a cigar as long as a walking stick&quot;.

Milius was also instrumental during the startup of the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) organization: it was his idea to use the octagon-shaped cage, and his association with UFC helped provide interest and investors to the startup UFC.

In 2013, a documentary about his life and career, titled &quot;Milius&quot;, was released.

Writer Nat Segaloff called Milius:

The best writer of the so-called USC Mafia, a tight-knit group that resuscitated—some say homogenised American cinema in the 1970s ... Raised on Ford, Hawks, Lean and Kurosawa, shaped by filmmakers as disparate as Fellini and Delmer Daves, Milius favours history books over comic books, character over special effects, and heroes with roots in reality, time, place and customs. Milius&#x27; stories reflect his own deeply held ethic, which embraces the values of tradition, adventure, spiritualism, honour and an intense loyalty to friends ... Although he privately chafes at his public image as a gun-toting, liberal baiting provocateur, he allows himself to be painted as such, at times even holding the brush. He plays the Hollywood game like a pro, yet sticks to his own rules; he is a romantic filmmaker who avoids love scenes; his movies contain violence, yet no death in them is without meaning.

Milius himself once said:

Never compromise excellence. To write for someone else is the biggest mistake that any writer makes. You should be your biggest competitor, your biggest critic, your biggest fan, because you don&#x27;t know what anybody else thinks. How arrogant it is to assume that you know the market, that you know what&#x27;s popular today—only Steven Spielberg knows what&#x27;s popular today. Only Steven Spielberg will ever know what&#x27;s popular. So leave it to him. He&#x27;s the only one in the history of man who has ever figured that out. Write what you want to see. Because if you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;re not going to have any true passion in it, and it&#x27;s not going to be done with any true artistry.

Triple H, Retired WWE wrestler and current Head of Creative for WWE cites Milius as an inspiration in how to tell a compelling story within a wrestling match without having to rely on over-the-top action, as he stated that Milius didn’t rely on action in his work to tell a compelling story to the audience.

A character in the 2023 film &quot;Rebel Moon&quot; is named after Milius as an homage from the film&#x27;s co-writers Kurt Johnstad and Zack Snyder.

== Awards and honors ==
For writing the &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; screenplay, Milius and Francis Ford Coppola were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, and the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Drama Written Directly for the Screen (Though the film was an adaptation of &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, the Writers Guild considered it an original screenplay.).

In 2007, Milius was the recipient of the Austin Film Festival&#x27;s Distinguished Screenwriter Award. In his acceptance speech, he said that his favorites of his films were &quot;The Wind and the Lion&quot;, &quot;Big Wednesday&quot;, and &quot;Conan&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Milius has been married three times. He has two children with his first wife, and one child with his second wife, Celia Kaye. His current marriage (since 1992) is to Elan Oberon.

Milius was a passionate surfer for much of his life but gave it up when he turned fifty.

=== Views ===
Milius is a self-proclaimed &quot;Zen anarchist&quot;, but he also publicly aligns himself with conservative factions in Hollywood and he was interviewed in the documentary &quot;Rated R: Republicans in Hollywood&quot;. He has also been consultant to a military think tank, the Institute for Creative Technologies. Milius said:

I&#x27;m not a reactionary—I&#x27;m just a right-wing extremist so far beyond the Christian Identity people like that and stuff, that they can&#x27;t even imagine. I&#x27;m so far beyond that I&#x27;m a Maoist. I&#x27;m an anarchist. I&#x27;ve always been an anarchist. Any true, real right-winger if he goes far enough hates all form of government, because government should be done to cattle and not human beings.

Milius has endorsed minimum wage laws and conscription. Milius was also quoted as saying that &quot;it might not have been bad for this country&quot; if Douglas MacArthur had &quot;crossed the Mississippi like Caesar crossed the Rubicon and proclaimed himself Emperor Douglas the First.&quot; For years, Milius was a member of the board of directors of the National Rifle Association of America (NRA), where he was a leader (with Charlton Heston) in resisting a takeover attempt by advocates of the so-called Militia Movement.

&quot;I&#x27;d like to be Jack Hawkins in &quot;Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;&quot;, said Milius. &quot;I call myself romantic. I believe in a lot of 19th-century ideals: chivalry, honor, loyalty, romantic love.&quot;

In 2009, Milius signed a petition in support of Roman Polanski, who had been detained while traveling to a film festival in relation to his 1977 sexual abuse charges, which the petition argued would undermine the tradition of film festivals as a place for works to be shown &quot;freely and safely&quot;, and that arresting filmmakers traveling to neutral countries could open the door &quot;for actions of which no-one can know the effects.&quot;

<text>Pegasus Bridge, originally called the Bénouville Bridge after the neighbouring village, is a road crossing over the Caen Canal, between Caen and Ouistreham in Normandy. The original bridge, built in 1934, is now a war memorial and is the centrepiece of the Memorial Pegasus museum at nearby Ranville. It was replaced in 1994 by a modern design which, like the old one, is a bascule bridge.

On 6 June 1944, during the Second World War, the bridge was, along with the nearby Ranville Bridge over the Orne River (another road crossing, later renamed Horsa Bridge), the objective of members of D Company, 2nd (Airborne) Battalion, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, a glider-borne force who were part of the 6th Airlanding Brigade of the 6th Airborne Division during Operation Tonga in the opening minutes of the Allied invasion of Normandy. Under the command of Major John Howard, D Company was to land close by the bridges in six Airspeed Horsa gliders and, in a &quot;coup-de-main&quot; operation, take both intact and hold them until relieved by the main British invasion forces. The successful capture of the bridges played an important role in limiting the effectiveness of a German counter-attack in the aftermath of the Normandy invasion, as did the attack on nearby Merville Gun Battery.

Later in 1944, the Bénouville Bridge was renamed Pegasus Bridge in honour of the operation. The name is derived from the shoulder emblem worn by British airborne forces of I Airborne Corps (United Kingdom), which depicts Bellerophon riding the flying horse Pegasus.

==Design==
Pegasus Bridge and the structure that replaced it in 1994 are examples of a distinct sub type of bascule bridge, the &quot;Scherzer rolling lift bascule bridge&quot; or &quot;rolling bridge&quot;. Bridges of this type do not pivot about a hinge point, but roll back on curved tread plates attached to the girders of the main span. This design allows a greater clearance of the waterway for a given opening angle.

==Battle for the bridge==

On the night of 5 June 1944, a force of 181 men, led by Major John Howard, took off from RAF Tarrant Rushton in Dorset, southern England in six Horsa gliders to capture Pegasus Bridge, and also &quot;Horsa Bridge&quot;, a few hundred yards/metres to the east, over the Orne River. The force was composed of D Company (reinforced with two platoons of B Company), 2nd Battalion, Oxford and Bucks Light Infantry; 20 sappers of the Royal Engineers of 249 Field Company (Airborne); and men of the Glider Pilot Regiment. The object of this action was to prevent German armour from crossing the bridges and attacking the eastern flank of the landings at Sword Beach, and to prevent the British 6th Airborne Division from being cut off.

Five of the Ox and Bucks&#x27;s gliders landed as close as from their objectives 16 minutes past midnight. The attackers poured out of their battered gliders, completely surprising the German defenders, and took the bridges within 10 minutes. They lost two men in the process, Lieutenant Den Brotheridge and Lance corporal Fred Greenhalgh.

Greenhalgh drowned in a nearby pond when his glider landed. Lieutenant Brotheridge was mortally wounded crossing the bridge in the first minutes of the assault and became the first member of the invading Allied armies to die as a result of enemy fire on D-Day.

One glider, assigned to the capture of the Orne river bridge, landed at the bridge over the River Dives, some away. Most of the soldiers in this glider moved through German lines towards the village of Ranville where they eventually re-joined the British forces. The Ox and Bucks were reinforced at 03.00hrs by Lieutenant Colonel Pine-Coffin&#x27;s 7th Parachute Battalion, and linked up with the beach landing forces with the arrival of Lord Lovat&#x27;s Commandos.

Among the first of the 7th Battalion reinforcements was Lieutenant Richard Todd, a young actor, who, nearly two decades later, would play Major Howard in the film &quot;The Longest Day&quot;.

=== Commemorations ===
In 1984, as part of the 40th anniversary commemorations, the Royal Yacht Britannia sailed past the bridge en route to Caen. The ship passed in the early hours, escorted by two tugs and HMS Torquay.

==Today==
The original Pegasus Bridge now resides in the grounds of the Pegasus Museum. The museum was inaugurated by the Prince of Wales on 4 June 2000, Brigadier James Hill, Françoise Gondrée foundress with General Sir Richard Nelson Gale as Président, and lies at the Eastern end of the current bridge. The original bridge was replaced in 1994 by the wider, stronger structure, built by Spie Batignolles. It had been extended by 5 metres in the early 1960s to accommodate the widening of the canal and remained in use until 1993. After its replacement, Pegasus Bridge was left on waste ground. The bridge was sold to the museum for the symbolic price of one franc.

Many of the soldiers killed in the actions of June 1944 are buried in the war cemetery at Ranville. Lt. Brotheridge&#x27;s grave, which is located in the churchyard next to the cemetery, has a commemorative plaque that was installed by the Gondrée family. The museum contains a café and a small museum shop that sells Pegasus Bridge related material. Arlette Gondrée, who now runs Café Gondrée, was a small child living in the home when it was liberated. It is not certain that the famous Gondrée café was the first French house to be liberated during D-Day. In the book &quot;Commando du Pont Pegase&quot;, French historian Norbert Hugedé writes that it was the house owned by Mr Picot that was liberated first, a few hours before the Gondrées&#x27; house.

&quot;Pegasus Wood&quot;, in the grounds of Temple Newsam House in Leeds, commemorates veterans of the landing at Pegasus Bridge.

<text>Misnagdim (, &quot;Opponents&quot;; Sephardi pronunciation: &quot;Mitnagdim&quot;; singular &quot;misnaged / mitnaged&quot;) was a religious movement among the Jews of Eastern Europe which resisted the rise of Hasidism in the 18th and 19th centuries. The &quot;Misnagdim&quot; were particularly concentrated in Lithuania, where Vilnius served as the bastion of the movement, but anti-Hasidic activity was undertaken by the establishment in many locales. The most severe clashes between the factions took place in the latter third of the 18th century; the failure to contain Hasidism led the &quot;Misnagdim&quot; to develop distinct religious philosophies and communal institutions, which were not merely a perpetuation of the old status quo but often innovative. The most notable results of these efforts, pioneered by Chaim of Volozhin and continued by his disciples, were the modern, independent &quot;yeshiva&quot; and the Musar movement. Since the late 19th century, tensions with the Hasidim largely subsided, and the heirs of &quot;Misnagdim&quot; adopted the epithet Litvishe or &quot;Litvaks&quot;.

==Origins==

The rapid spread of Hasidism in the second half of the 18th century greatly troubled many traditional rabbis; many saw it as heretical. Much of Judaism was still fearful of the messianic movements of the Sabbateans and the Frankists, followers of the messianic claimants Sabbatai Zevi (1626–1676) and Jacob Frank (1726–1791). Many rabbis suspected Hasidism of an intimate connection with these movements.

Hasidism&#x27;s founder was Rabbi Israel ben Eliezer ( 1700–1760), known as the &quot;Baal Shem Tov&quot; (&quot;master of a good name&quot; usually applied to a saintly Jew who was also a wonder-worker), or simply by the acronym &quot;Besht&quot; (); he taught that man&#x27;s relationship with God depended on immediate religious experience, in addition to knowledge and observance of the details of the Torah and Talmud.

The characteristically &quot;misnagdic&quot; approach to Judaism was marked by a concentration on highly intellectual Talmud study; however, it by no means rejected mysticism. The movement&#x27;s leaders, like the Gaon of Vilna and Chaim of Volozhin, were deeply immersed in &quot;kabbalah&quot;. Their difference with the Hasidim was their opposition to involving mystical teachings and considerations in the public life, outside the elitist circles which studied and practiced &quot;kabbalah&quot;. The Hasidic leaders&#x27; inclination to rule in legal matters, binding for the whole community (as opposed to strictures voluntarily adopted by the few), based on mystical considerations, greatly angered the &quot;Misnagdim&quot;. On another, theoretical level, Chaim of Volozhin and his disciples did not share Hasidism&#x27;s basic notion that man could grasp the immanence of God&#x27;s presence in the created universe, thus being able to transcend ordinary reality and potentially infuse common actions with spiritual meaning. However, Volozhin&#x27;s exact position on the issue is subject to debate among researchers. Some believe that the differences between the two schools of thought were almost semantic, while others regard their understanding of key doctrines as starkly different.

Lithuania became the heartland of the traditionalist opposition to Hasidism, to the extent that in popular perception &quot;Lithuanian&quot; and &quot;misnaged&quot; became virtually interchangeable terms. In fact, however, a sizable minority of Greater Lithuanian Jews belong(ed) to Hasidic groups, including Chabad, Slonim, Karlin-Stolin (Pinsk), Amdur and Koidanov.

The first documented opposition to the Hasidic movement was from the Jewish community in Shklow, Lithuania in the year 1772. Rabbis and community leaders voiced concerns about the Hasidim because they were making their way to Lithuania. The rabbis sent letters forbidding Hasidic prayer houses, urging the burning of Hasidic texts, and humiliating prominent Hasidic leaders. The rabbis imprisoned the Hasidic leaders in an attempt to isolate them from coming into contact with their followers.

==Opposition by the Vilna Gaon==

The bans of excommunication against Hasidic Jews in 1772 were accompanied by the public ripping up of several early Hasidic pamphlets. The Vilna Gaon, Elijah ben Solomon Zalman, a prominent rabbi, galvanized opposition to Hasidic Judaism. He believed that the claims of miracles and visions made by Hasidic Jews were lies and delusions. A key point of opposition was that the Vilna Gaon maintained that greatness in Torah and observance must come through natural human efforts at Torah study without relying on any external &quot;miracles&quot; and &quot;wonders&quot;. On the other hand, the &quot;Ba&#x27;al Shem Tov&quot; was more focused on bringing encouragement and raising the morale of the Jewish people, especially following the Chmelnitzki pogroms (1648–1654) and the aftermath of disillusionment in the Jewish masses following the millennial excitement heightened by the failed messianic claims of Sabbatai Zevi and Jacob Frank. Opponents of Hasidim held that Hasidim viewed their rebbes in an idolatrous fashion.

==Hasidism&#x27;s changes and challenges==
Most of the changes made by the Hasidim were the product of the Hasidic approach to Kabbalah, mainly as expressed by Isaac Luria (1534–1572) and his disciples, particularly Hayyim ben Joseph Vital (1543–1620). Luria greatly influenced both misnagdim and Hasidim, but the legalistic Misnagdim feared what they perceived as disturbing parallels in Hasidism to the heretical Sabbateans. An example of such an idea was that God entirely nullifies the universe. Depending on how this idea was preached and interpreted, it could give rise to pantheism, universally acknowledged as heresy, or lead to immoral behavior, since elements of Kabbalah can be misconstrued to de-emphasize ritual and glorify sexual metaphors as a more profound means of grasping some inner hidden notions in the Torah based on the Jews&#x27; intimate relationship with God. If God is present in everything, and if divinity is to be grasped in erotic terms, then—Misnagdim feared—Hasidim might feel justified in neglecting legal distinctions between the holy and the profane, and in engaging in inappropriate sexual activities.

The Misnagdim were seen as using yeshivas and scholarship as the center of learning while Hasidim had learning centered around the rebbe tied in with what they considered emotional displays of piety.

The stress of Jewish prayer over Torah study and the Hasidic reinterpretation of &quot;Torah l&#x27;shma&quot; (Torah study for its own sake), was seen as a rejection of traditional Judaism.

Hasidim did not follow the traditional Ashkenazi prayer rite and instead used a combination of Ashkenazi and Sephardi rites based upon Lurianic Kabbalistic concepts. This was seen as a rejection of the traditional liturgy and, due to the resulting need for separate synagogues, a breach of communal unity. In addition, they faced criticism for neglecting the halakhic times for prayer.

Hasidic Jews also added some halakhic stringencies on kashrut (the laws of keeping kosher). They made certain changes in how livestock were slaughtered and in who was considered a reliable mashgiach (supervisor of kashrut). The result was that they essentially did not accept as kosher certain foods that were accepted as kosher by Misnagdim. This was seen as a change of traditional Judaism, and an over stringency of halakha, and, again, a breach of communal unity.

==Response to the rise of Hasidism==

With the rise of what would become known as Hasidism in the late 18th century, established conservative rabbinic authorities actively worked to stem its growth. Whereas before the breakaway Hasidic synagogues were occasionally opposed but largely checked, its spread into Lithuania and Belarus prompted a concerted effort by opposing rabbis to halt its spread.

In late 1772, after uniting the scholars of Brisk, Minsk and other Belarusian and Lithuanian communities, the Vilna Gaon then issued the first of many polemical letters against the nascent Hasidic movement, which was included in the anti-Hasidic anthology, &quot;Zemir aritsim ve-ḥarvot tsurim&quot; (1772). The letters published in the anthology included pronouncements of excommunication against Hasidic leaders on the basis of their worship and habits, all of which were seen as unorthodox by the &quot;Misnagdim&quot;. This included but was not limited to unsanctioned places of worship and ecstatic prayers, as well as charges of smoking, dancing, and the drinking of alcohol. In total, this was seen to be a radical departure from the Misnagdic norm of asceticism, scholarship, and stoic demeanor in worship and general conduct, and was viewed as a development that needed to be suppressed.

Between 1772 and 1791, other Misnagdic tracts of this type would follow, all targeting the Hasidim in an effort to contain and eradicate them from Jewish communities. The harshest of these denouncements came between 1785 and 1815 combined with petitioning of the Russian government to outlaw the Hasidim on the grounds of their being spies, traitors, and subversives.

However, this would not be realized. After the death of the Vilna Gaon in 1797 and the partitions of Poland in 1793 and 1795, the regions of Poland where there were disputes between &quot;Misnagdim&quot; and Hasidim came under the control of governments that did not want to take sides in intra-Jewish conflicts, but that wanted instead to abolish Jewish autonomy. In 1804 Hasidism was legalized by the Imperial Russian government, and efforts by the &quot;Misnagdim&quot; to contain the now-widespread Hasidim were stymied.

== Winding down the battles ==

By the mid-19th century most of non-Hasidic Judaism had discontinued its struggle with Hasidism and had reconciled itself to the establishment of the latter as a fact. One reason for the reconciliation between the Hasidim and the &quot;Misnagdim&quot; was the rise of the Haskalah movement. While many followers of this movement were observant, it was also used by the absolutist state to change Jewish education and culture, which both &quot;Misnagdim&quot; and Hasidim perceived as a greater threat to religion than they represented to each other. In the modern era, Misnagdim continue to thrive, but they are more commonly called &quot;Litvishe&quot; or &quot;Yeshivish.&quot;

==Litvishe==
&quot;Litvishe&quot; is a Yiddish word that refers to Haredi Jews who are not Hasidim (and not Hardalim or Sephardic Haredim). It literally means Lithuanian. While &quot;Litvishe&quot; functions as an adjective, the plural noun form often used is &quot;Litvaks&quot;. The Hebrew plural noun form which is used with the same meaning is &quot;Lita&#x27;im&quot;. Other expressions are &quot;Yeshivishe&quot; and &quot;Misnagdim&quot;. It has been equated with the term &quot;Yeshiva world&quot;.

The words &quot;Litvishe&quot;, &quot;Lita&#x27;im&quot;, and &quot;Litvaks&quot; are all somewhat misleading, because there are also Hasidic Jews from Lithuania, and many Lithuanian Jews who are not Haredi.

Litvishe Jews largely identify with the &quot;Misnagdim&quot;, who &quot;objected to what they saw as Hasidic denigration of Torah study and normative Jewish law in favor of undue emphasis on emotionality and religious fellowship as pathways to the Divine.&quot; The term &quot;Misnagdim&quot; (&quot;opponents&quot;) is somewhat outdated since the former opposition between the two groups has lost much of its salience, so the other terms are more common.

<doc id="331355" wikidata="Q692979" url="?curid=331355" title="Keir Dullea">
<text>Keir Atwood Dullea ( ; born May 30, 1936) is an American actor. He is best known for his portrayal of astronaut David Bowman in the 1968 film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; and its 1984 sequel, &quot;2010: The Year We Make Contact&quot;. His other film roles include &quot;David and Lisa&quot; (1962), &quot;Bunny Lake Is Missing&quot; (1965), and &quot;Black Christmas&quot; (1974). Dullea studied acting at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York City. He has also performed on stage in New York City and in regional theaters; he has said that, despite being more recognized for his film work, he prefers the stage.

==Early life==
Keir Atwood Dullea was born on May 30, 1936, at the Mount Sinai Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of Margaret () and Robert Dullea. His mother was of Scottish descent, and his father was a second-generation Irish-American. He was raised in the Greenwich Village section of New York City, where his parents ran a bookstore. He graduated from George School in Pennsylvania, attended Rutgers University and San Francisco State University, then pursued an acting career.

==Career==
Dullea made his debut in a television adaptation of &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot; (1960) with Maureen O&#x27;Hara, playing the German pilot. He was also in the TV films &quot;Give Us Barabbas!&quot; (1961) and an adaptation of &quot;All Summer Long&quot; (1961). He was in demand for guest appearances on television shows such as &quot;Route 66&quot;, &quot;The New Breed&quot;, &quot;Checkmate&quot; and &quot;Cain&#x27;s Hundred&quot;. Dullea made his film debut in 1961 in &quot;Hoodlum Priest&quot;, cast on the strength of his work on &quot;Route 66&quot;. His performance was well received. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Disney offered long-term contracts (roles in &quot;Two Weeks in Another Town&quot; and &quot;Bon Voyage&quot;) but Dullea turned both down. He did accept a non-exclusive contract with Seven Arts and shot a pilot for a series that was not picked up. He appeared in Los Angeles on stage in &quot;The Short Happy Life&quot;.

In 1962, he starred with Janet Margolin in &quot;David and Lisa&quot;, a film based on the book by Theodore Isaac Rubin, M.D., a psychiatrist who treated the two mentally ill adolescents portrayed in the film. It was a low-budget film that became a break out hit, making over $2 million, and turning Dullea into an established name. &quot;Film Daily&quot; voted him &quot;find of the year&quot;. Dullea appeared on television in shows such as &quot;Empire&quot;, &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot;, &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;Naked City&quot;, &quot;Going My Way&quot;, &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;, &quot;Alcoa Premiere&quot;, &quot;Kraft Mystery Theater&quot;, &quot;Channing&quot;, and &quot;12 O&#x27;clock High&quot;. He was second-billed in &quot;Mail Order Bride&quot; (1964), written and directed by Burt Kennedy. Dullea starred in the first screen adaptation of James Jones&#x27; &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; (1964), then did a TV adaptation of &quot;Pale Horse, Pale Rider&quot; and went to Italy to star in &quot;The Naked Hour&quot; (1964).

In 1965, he guest-starred as Lieutenant Kurt Muller in the episode titled &quot;To Heinie, with Love&quot; of &quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot;. He took these roles to avoid being typecast as a troubled youth. Dullea went to England to make &quot;Bunny Lake Is Missing&quot; (1965), which co-starred Dullea with Laurence Olivier, Carol Lynley, and Noël Coward. Although they shared no scenes in the film, when Coward initially met Dullea on the set, he uttered the often quoted line &quot;Keir Dullea, gone tomorrow.&quot; Nonetheless, he was voted one of 1965&#x27;s &quot;stars of tomorrow&quot;.

Dullea played the son of Lana Turner&#x27;s character in Ross Hunter&#x27;s remake of &quot;Madame X&quot; (1966), which underperformed commercially. He then appeared with Anne Heywood and Sandy Dennis in the Canadian box office hit, &quot;The Fox&quot; (1967). His first Broadway appearance was in 1967 in Ira Levin&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Cook&#x27;s Garden&quot; with Burl Ives, which only had a short run.

In 1968, Dullea appeared as astronaut David Bowman in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, which became a box-office success and is recognized by critics, filmmakers and audiences as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made. His line &quot;Open the pod bay doors please, HAL&quot; is #78 on the American Film Institute&#x27;s list of 100 film quotes. Dullea was offered the title role in the 1969 film &quot;De Sade&quot;, playing the title role (the Marquis de Sade). The film was a critical and commercial disappointment. He had success on Broadway, starring in the 1969 hit comedy &quot;Butterflies Are Free&quot; with Eileen Heckart and Blythe Danner. In the play, he introduced the title song written by Stephen Schwartz (later recording the tune on an album for Platypus Records). The play was a huge hit, running for 1,128 performances, although Dullea did not appear in the film version.

Dullea travelled to London to be in the production of &quot;Butterflies&quot; there and decided to stay. He did a series of TV films: &quot;Black Water Gold&quot; (1970), &quot;Montserrat&quot; (1971), and &quot;A Kiss Is Just a Kiss&quot; (1971). He did a thriller in Italy, &quot;Devil in the Brain&quot; (1972), and guest starred on &quot;McMillan &amp; Wife&quot;.

Dullea worked in Canada on the film &quot;Paperback Hero&quot; (1973) and worked in that country for a number of years. He had the lead role in a Canadian TV series &quot;The Starlost&quot; (1973) but it only ran 18 episodes. He was a regular voice on &quot;CBS Radio Mystery Theater&quot;, which ran from 1974 to 1982. He was credited on five episodes. Dullea was in &quot;Paul and Michelle&quot; (1974) and had a major role in the Canadian production, 1974 cult classic &quot;Black Christmas&quot; as Peter Smythe, Jess Bradford’s boyfriend. Also in 1974, he played Brick in the Tennessee Williams classic &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; opposite Elizabeth Ashley and Fred Gwynne on Broadway which ran 160 performances. The production featured the now definitive rewrite of the play. He also starred in the 1975 play &quot;P.S. Your Cat Is Dead&quot;. Dullea was one of the last people to see actor Sal Mineo alive. The two were rehearsing for the play on the night of Mineo&#x27;s murder.

He appeared in &quot;Law and Order&quot; (1976) for TV, the Canadian film &quot;Welcome to Blood City&quot; (1977), &quot;The Haunting of Julia&quot; (1977), and &quot;Three Dangerous Ladies&quot; (1977), the British &quot;Leopard in the Snow&quot; (1977), the Australian &quot;Because He&#x27;s My Friend&quot; (1978), and some films for TV: &quot;The Legend of the Golden Gun&quot; (1978), an adaptation of &quot;Brave New World&quot; (1980), &quot;The Hostage Tower&quot; (1980), &quot;No Place to Hide&quot; (1981), and &quot;BrainWaves&quot; (1982).

In 1981, Dullea moved to Westport, Connecticut. In 1982, he starred in an off-Broadway production of &quot;Sweet Prince&quot; under the direction of his wife Susie Fuller. The following year, the couple co-founded the Theater Artists Workshop of Westport. Dullea appeared as a regular cast member in the Canadian soap opera &quot;Loving Friends and Perfect Couples&quot;, which ran in 1983. He was in &quot;Blind Date&quot; (1984) and &quot;The Next One&quot; (1984). In 1984, he reprised his role as David Bowman in &quot;2010: The Year We Make Contact&quot;, Peter Hyams&#x27; sequel to &quot;2001&quot;. &quot;2010&quot; was nominated for five Academy Awards. In July 1984, Dullea was guest artist aboard the ocean liner &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot;. On July 11, he performed Anton Chekhov&#x27;s one-act play &quot;The Harmfulness of Tobacco&quot; in the QE2 Theatre.

Dullea returned to Broadway when he joined the cast of the successful &quot;Doubles&quot; (1985–86). He toured with a theatre show &quot;Keir Dullea and Friends&quot; (1988).

In 1990 he said &quot;My career has a lot to do with choices I made in my life. My focus over the last, oh, at least 10 years has been the theater. I really haven&#x27;t made very much effort with films. I did more than 20 plays before I ever did &quot;The Hoodlum Priest&quot;, and (after that) I&#x27;ve done more than 20 films... It wasn&#x27;t as if the industry had fired me; I had just made certain life decisions I suddenly was having to pay the piper for. So there was no film career at all. I&#x27;m always working (in theater). If I&#x27;m not engaged on stage in something, I&#x27;m working with my wife on another project. I no longer live my life waiting for my phone to ring to give me permission to work.&quot; He performed in &quot;The Servant&quot; on stage in 1990.

Dullea was in &quot;Oh, What a Night&quot; (1992) and played F. Scott Fitzgerald off Broadway in &quot;The Other Side of Paradise&quot; (1992). In 2000, he appeared in &quot;The Audrey Hepburn Story&quot; as Hepburn&#x27;s father Joseph. That year he was also in &quot;Songs in Ordinary Time&quot; (2000), and episodes of &quot;Witchblade&quot;, &quot;Ed&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; and &quot;Law and Order&quot;.

In summer 2002, he performed in the Washington Shakespeare Theatre&#x27;s production of &quot;The Little Foxes&quot;. And the following year he could be seen in &quot;Alien Hunter&quot; (2003). In December 2004, for their annual birthday celebration to &quot;The Master&quot;, the Noël Coward Society invited Dullea as the guest celebrity to lay flowers in front of Coward&#x27;s statue at New York&#x27;s Gershwin Theatre, thereby commemorating the 105th birthday of Sir Noël. Around the same time, Sony Home Video released &quot;Bunny Lake Is Missing&quot; for the first time on DVD.

In 2006, he played Andrew Keener in &quot;Cost of Capital&quot;, which was the 16th episode, of the 16 season of the original &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; American television series, and he had a role as a US Senator and a &quot;major influence and mentor&quot; to Matt Damon&#x27;s character, in Robert De Niro&#x27;s film &quot;The Good Shepherd&quot; (2006). He was the narrator in an off Broadway production of &quot;Mary Rose&quot; (2007). Dullea was in &quot;The Accidental Husband&quot; (2009), &quot;All Me, All the Time&quot; (2009), &quot;Castle&quot;, &quot;Fortune&quot; (2009), and &quot;Damages&quot;.

In April 2010, Dullea performed the role of Tom Garrison in the off-Broadway production of the Robert Anderson play, &quot;I Never Sang for My Father&quot; co-starring Oscar-nominated actress Marsha Mason (as Margaret Garrison) and film and stage actor Matt Servitto (as Gene Garrison). In October 2012, Dullea performed the role of Heinrich Mann in the Guthrie Theater production of &quot;Tales from Hollywood&quot; by Christopher Hampton.

He was in &quot;Isn&#x27;t It Delicious&quot; (2013) with his wife Mia Dillon, &quot;Infinitely Polar Bear&quot; (2014), &quot;Space Station 76&quot; (2014), and &quot;April Flowers&quot; (2017).

During August and September 2013, Keir Dullea starred as Big Daddy in &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot;, playing opposite wife Mia Dillon in a joint production for Wellfleet Harbor Actors Theater and Provincetown Tennessee Williams Theater Festival. Between July 10-August 2, 2015, Dullea and wife Mia Dillon were joined by Todd Cerveris, Cameron Clifford, Don Noble and Christa Scott-Reed in the Bucks County Playhouse production of Ernest Thompson&#x27;s &quot;On Golden Pond&quot;.

He had a regular role in &quot;The Path&quot; (2014–16) and could be seen in &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; (2018). Dullea was cast as Fleet Admiral Terrence Hood, a high-ranking UNSC officer, in the Paramount+ TV series &quot;Halo&quot; which premiered on .

<text>Jerry Alan West (May 28, 1938 – June 12, 2024) was an American basketball player and executive. He played professionally for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA), and is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time. His nicknames included &quot;the Logo&quot;, in reference to his silhouette being the basis for the NBA logo; &quot;Mr. Clutch&quot;, for his ability to make a big play in a key situation such as his famous buzzer-beating 60-foot shot that tied Game 3 of the 1970 NBA Finals against the New York Knicks; &quot;Mr. Outside&quot;, in reference to his perimeter play with the Lakers and &quot;Zeke from Cabin Creek&quot; for the creek near his birthplace of Chelyan, West Virginia.

West played college basketball for the West Virginia Mountaineers, leading them to the 1959 NCAA championship game. He earned the NCAA Final Four Most Outstanding Player honor despite the loss in the championship. He then embarked on a 14-year career with the Lakers and was the co-captain of the 1960 U.S. Olympic gold medal team, a squad that was inducted as a unit into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2010.

West&#x27;s NBA career was highly successful. Playing the guard position, he was voted 12 times into the All-NBA First and Second Teams, was elected into the NBA All-Star Team 14 times and was chosen as the All-Star MVP in 1972, the same year that he won the only title of his career. West holds the NBA record for the highest points per game average in a playoff series with 46.3. He was also a member of the first five NBA All-Defensive Teams (one second, followed by four firsts), which were introduced when he was 32 years old. Having played in nine NBA Finals, he is also the only player in NBA history to be named Finals MVP despite being on the losing team (1969). In 1980, West was inducted into the Hall of Fame and named to the NBA 35th Anniversary Team. West was named as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996, and to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021.

After his playing career ended, West took over as head coach of the Lakers for three years. He led Los Angeles into the playoffs each year and earned a Western Conference finals berth once. Working as a player-scout for three years, West was named general manager of the Lakers before the 1982–83 NBA season. Under his reign, Los Angeles won six championship rings. In 2002, West became general manager of the Memphis Grizzlies and helped the franchise win their first-ever playoff berths. For his contributions, West won the NBA Executive of the Year Award twice: once as a Lakers manager (1995) and then as a Grizzlies manager (2004). He won two more NBA titles as a consultant with the Golden State Warriors (2015, 2017). In 2024, he was inducted to the Hall of Fame as a contributor to the sport as an executive and consultant.

==Early life==
West was born into a poor household in Chelyan, West Virginia, on May 28, 1938. He was the fifth of six children of Cecil Sue West, a housewife, and Howard Stewart West, a coal mine electrician. West&#x27;s father physically abused him, and West has stated that for a time he slept with a loaded shotgun under his bed out of fear that he might have to kill his father in self-defense.

West was an outgoing and aggressive child in his youth. In 1951, his older brother, David, was killed in action in the Korean War, and the grief turned him into a shy and introverted boy. Growing up, West spent his days hunting and fishing, but his main activity was shooting at a basketball hoop that a neighbor had nailed to his storage shed. West spent days shooting baskets from every possible angle, ignoring mud and snow in the backyard, as well as his mother&#x27;s whippings when he came home hours late for dinner.

West attended East Bank High School in East Bank, West Virginia, from 1952 to 1956. During his first year, West was benched by his coach Duke Shaver due to his lack of height. Shaver emphasized the importance of conditioning and defense, which were lessons that the teenager appreciated. West soon became the captain of the freshman team, and during the summer of 1953 he grew to . West eventually became the team&#x27;s starting small forward, and he quickly established himself as one of the finest West Virginia high school players of his generation. He represented East Bank High School at a high level on and off the court, attending the 1955 session of Mountaineer Boys State and was named All-State from 1953 to 1956, then All-American in 1956 when he was West Virginia Player of the Year, becoming the state&#x27;s first high-school player to score more than 900 points in a season, with an average of 32.2 points per game. West&#x27;s mid-range jump shot became his trademark and he often used it to score while under pressure from opposing defenses. West led East Bank to a state championship on March 24 that year, prompting East Bank High School to change its name to &quot;West Bank High School&quot; every year on March 24 in honor of their basketball prodigy. This practice remained in effect until the school closed in 1999.

==College career==

West graduated from East Bank High School in 1956, and more than 60 universities showed interest in him. He eventually chose to stay in his home state and attend West Virginia University (WVU), located in Morgantown. In his freshman year (1956–57), West was a member of the WVU freshman squad that achieved a perfect record of 17 straight wins over the course of the season; other team members included Jay Jacobs and Willie Akers. In his first varsity year under head coach Fred Schaus, West scored 17.8 points per game and averaged 11.1 rebounds; he also started in all 28 games while shooting 49.6% from the field and 73.2% from the free throw line. These performances earned him a multitude of honors, among them an All-American Third Team call-up, First Team All-Southern Conference, Southern Conference Tournament Most Valuable Player Award and First Team honors, Chuck Taylor–Converse Second-team All-American honors, and Associated Press and United Press International Third-team All-America honors. The Mountaineers went 26–2 that year, ending the season with a loss to Manhattan College in postseason tournament play.

During his junior year (1958–59), West scored 26.6 points per game and grabbed 12.3 rebounds per game. He tied the NCAA five-game tournament record of 160 points (32 points per game) and led all scorers and rebounders in every West Virginia game, including getting 28 points and 11 rebounds in a 71–70 loss to California in the final. West was named Most Outstanding Player of that year&#x27;s Final Four. Further awards were All-America, Southern Conference Tournament MVP and Southern Conference Player of the Year and Athlete of the Year. He was also named to be a member of the U.S. Pan American Games basketball team that won the gold medal. West demonstrated his tenacity for the game in a match against the Kentucky Wildcats. He broke his nose during an incident in the game, but he continued to play despite intense pain and having to breathe through his mouth. He scored 19 points in the second half, leading WVU to an upset victory.

In his final collegiate season (1959–60), West enjoyed several career highs, such as scoring 29.3 points per game, a 134 season-assists, 16.5 rebounds per game, and a shooting average of 50.4% from the field, 76.6% from the free throw line. He was honored again with several awards: a call-up to the All-America selection, and being voted Southern Conference MVP. West&#x27;s best performance was a game against Virginia, in which he grabbed 16 rebounds and scored 40 points. Moreover, during that final year, he had 30 double-doubles and fifteen 30-point games. In his collegiate career, West totaled 2,309 points and 1,240 rebounds. He averaged 24.8 points per game and 13.3 rebounds. As of 2011, West holds 12 WVU all-time records. West and Oscar Robertson co-captained the U.S. men&#x27;s basketball team that won the gold medal at the 1960 Summer Olympics.

==Professional career==

=== Los Angeles Lakers (1960–1974) ===

==== 1960–64: Mr. Inside and Mr. Outside ====
West made himself available for the 1960 NBA draft, and he was drafted with the second overall pick by the Minneapolis Lakers, shortly before the team relocated to Los Angeles. West became the first draft pick ever of the relocated franchise. His college coach, Schaus, was also hired that same season to coach the Lakers. He played West as a guard, in contrast to West&#x27;s college days as a forward. The Lakers were captained by Hall-of-Fame forward Elgin Baylor, who was complemented by centers Jim Krebs and Ray Felix; forwards Rudy LaRusso and Tom Hawkins; and guards Rod Hundley (from West Virginia, like West), Frank Selvy, and Bobby Leonard. This team perennially had strong forwards and guards, but was constantly weak at center, giving them a disadvantage against the Boston Celtics with their Hall-of-Fame center, Bill Russell.

Initially, West felt odd in his new environment. He was a loner. His high-pitched voice earned him the nickname &quot;Tweety Bird&quot;, and he spoke with such a thick Appalachian accent that his teammates also referred to him as &quot;Zeke from Cabin Creek&quot; (his nickname acknowledged his country roots, and his accent was so thick that he squeaked his nickname sheepishly – &quot;Zeek from Cab&#x27;n Creek&quot;). He soon impressed his colleagues with his defensive hustle, with his vertical jump—he could reach up 16 inches above the rim when he went up—and with his work ethic, spending countless extra hours working on his game. On the floor, West scored 17.6 points, grabbed 7.7 rebounds and dished 4.2 assists per game. West won Schaus&#x27;s trust and, alternating with Hundley, Selvy, and Leonard, played 35 minutes per game and established himself as the Lakers&#x27; second scoring option. The NBA commented that the Lakers now had a potent one-two-punch—with &quot;Mr. Inside&quot; (the low-post scorer, Baylor) and &quot;Mr. Outside&quot; (the long-distance shooter, West). These performances soon earned West his first of fourteen NBA All-Star Game call-ups.

West helped the Lakers improve from their previous 25-win season to 36 wins as they reached the 1961 NBA Playoffs. They needed all five games to put away the Detroit Pistons but then lost to the St. Louis Hawks in seven games, losing the final game 105–103.
In the 1961–62 NBA season, Baylor was called up by the U.S. Army Reserves and could play only 48 games. West took over the role of team leader and established himself as the main Lakers scorer, averaging 30.8 points, 7.9 rebounds and 5.4 assists per game, winning All-NBA First Team honors. On January 17, 1962, West scored a career-high 63 points in a 129–121 win over the New York Knicks. West became known especially for hitting important late-game shots, and Lakers&#x27; announcer Chick Hearn named him &quot;Mr. Clutch&quot; a handle which stuck with West for his entire career.

The Lakers won 54 regular-season games and secured a first-round bye in the 1962 NBA Playoffs. They beat the Pistons four games to two to advance to the 1962 NBA Finals against the Boston Celtics. The teams split the first two games, and at the end of Game 3 in Los Angeles, West tied the game at 115. The Celtics&#x27; Sam Jones inbounded the ball at half-court with three seconds left. West stole the ball, raced up court, and converted a running layup as the buzzer sounded. The Celtics tied the series in Game 6 at three games apiece, and the teams headed to Boston for Game 7. For most of the game, the Lakers trailed, but West and Frank Selvy hit several clutch baskets and tied the game at 100. Selvy then missed an open 8-foot shot which would have won the Lakers their first title. Baylor&#x27;s tip-in attempt was thwarted by Sam Jones. In overtime, Jones scored several clutch baskets to ensure a 110–107 win for the Celtics. The 1962 NBA Finals would serve as the beginning of the greatest rivalry in NBA history.

In the 1962–63 NBA season, Baylor was back full-time. West averaged 27.8 points, 7 rebounds and 5.6 assists and was again NBA All-Star and All-NBA First-Team. He played only 55 regular-season games, missing the last seven weeks due to a hamstring injury. Again, the Lakers reached the Finals, and again, they battled the Celtics. With West not yet in shape, Baylor and the Lakers fell back 3–2; then they succumbed in Game 6 in front of their home crowd with a 112–109 loss. As the game ended, veteran Celtics playmaker Bob Cousy threw the ball high into the rafters of the L.A. Sports Arena.

In the following 1963–64 NBA season, West became the Lakers&#x27; scoring leader for the first time. His 28.7 points per game eclipsed the 25.4 by Baylor, who stated that he suffered from knee problems. The Lakers struggled during the entire season, winning only 42 games, and were beaten by the Hawks in five games during the first round of the 1964 NBA Playoffs.

==== 1964–68: Leader of the Lakers ====

In the following 1964–65 NBA season, West averaged 31.0 points (at the time, a career-high), only surpassed by perennial scoring champion Wilt Chamberlain. After ending the regular season with 49 wins, L.A. played the Baltimore Bullets in the first round of the 1965 NBA Playoffs, but then team captain Baylor suffered a career-threatening knee injury. West spectacularly took over Baylor&#x27;s leading role, as he scored 49 points and willed the shocked Lakers to the win. In Game 2, Baltimore was unable to stop the Lakers guard, who scored 52 points, nearly half of L.A.&#x27;s total, in the 118–115 win. The Bullets took their two home games, despite West scoring 44 and 48 points respectively, but in the decisive Game 5 in L.A., the guard helped beat the Bullets with 42 points in a close 117–115 win. West averaged 46.3 points per game, a figure that is still an NBA record. In the 1965 NBA Finals, the Celtics easily beat the short-handed Lakers, 4–1. In Game 1, which Boston easily won, defensive Celtics guard K. C. Jones held West to only 26 points, and in Game 2, West scored 45 points, but Boston still won 129–123. In Game 3, West scored 49 points, and L.A. finally won a game, but in Games 4 and 5, the Lakers were beaten by double digits; in the last quarter of Game 5, West missed 14 of 15 shots and could not prevent yet another Celtics win. Still, the Lakers guard finished the playoffs with 40.6 points per game.

In the 1965–66 NBA season, West averaged a career-best 31.3 points, along with 7.1 rebounds and 6.1 assists per game. He made an NBA record 840 free throws, and earned yet another pair of All-Star Team and All-NBA First Team nominations. Winning 45 games, the Lakers beat the St. Louis Hawks in a close seven-game series, and yet again met the Boston Celtics in the 1966 NBA Finals. West was assisted by Baylor, who was a self-estimated &quot;75 percent&quot; of his pre-injury self, The two long-standing rivals split the first six games, with West&#x27;s usual scoring dominance countered by Celtics forward John Havlicek, whose size and speed created serious mismatch problems for the Lakers. In Game 7, West and Baylor shot a combined three of 18 in the first half, and the Lakers fell far behind; L.A. willed themselves back to a close 95–93 with four seconds left, but the Celtics ran the clock out and the Lakers were denied yet again.
The 1966–67 NBA season saw West playing only 66 regular-season games due to injury; his averages fell slightly to 28 points, 5.9 rebounds and 6.8 assists per game. The Lakers had a disappointing season, winning only 36 games and getting swept by the San Francisco Warriors in the first round of the 1967 NBA Playoffs. Veteran coach Fred Schaus retired, and Butch Van Breda Kolff took over; under his reign, the Lakers won 52 games in the 1967–68 NBA season in their first season in The Forum. The 52 wins were accumulated despite West playing only 51 regular season games due to injury and scoring 26.3 points, the lowest average since his rookie year: after being a First-Teamer for six times en bloc, he only made the All-NBA Second Team.

In the 1968 NBA Playoffs, the Lakers beat the Chicago Bulls and the Warriors to set up yet another Lakers-Celtics NBA Finals; it was considered a match of size versus speed, as the Lakers had nobody to guard Celtics coach/center Bill Russell or forward John Havlicek close to the basket, but the Celtics in return had difficulties guarding prolific L.A. outside shooters Baylor, West and fellow guard Gail Goodrich. In Game 1, West only hit seven of 24 shots, and the Lakers lost 107–101, but L.A. evened out the series at two games each. But West, who had scored 38 points in a Game 4 win, had sprained his ankle, and did not play at full strength the rest of the series. In Game 5, an injured West scored 35 points, but Boston won by 3 points. In Game 6, Havlicek shredded the Lakers with 40 points, and after yet another Finals loss to Boston, West commented that the Lakers lost two games they should have won: &quot;We gave them the first game, and we gave them the fifth. But I take nothing from them... They&#x27;re all that way on the Celtics, and you can&#x27;t teach it.&quot;

==== 1968–71: Arrival of Wilt Chamberlain ====

On July 9, 1968, the Lakers made a trade that brought reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Wilt Chamberlain of the Philadelphia 76ers to Los Angeles at the beginning of the 1968–69 NBA season. To get the center, the Lakers traded West&#x27;s backcourt partner Archie Clark, starting center Darrall Imhoff and backup forward Jerry Chambers to Philadelphia. Coach Van Breda Kolff was concerned about the drain at the guard positions after losing Clark, and especially after losing Goodrich in the expansion draft to the Phoenix Suns. He only had diminutive, defensively weak Johnny Egan left next to West. While West himself got on well with his new teammate, Chamberlain often argued with team captain Elgin Baylor and had a poor relationship with Van Breda Kolff. Van Breda Kolff pejoratively called Chamberlain &quot;The Load&quot;, and later complained that Chamberlain was egotistical, never respected him, too often slacked off in practice and focused too much on his statistics. In return, the center blasted Van Breda Kolff as &quot;the dumbest and worst coach ever&quot;. There was an altercation in which Chamberlain was about to punch Van Breda Kolff before Baylor had intervened. West was disturbed by locker room tension; used to playing on teams with good chemistry, his quality of play became erratic, and his scoring average of 25.9 points was his lowest since his rookie season. He made the Second Team of the inaugural All-Defensive Team.

In the 1969 NBA Playoffs, the 55-win Lakers defeated the Atlanta Hawks and the San Francisco Warriors, setting up the sixth finals series versus Boston in eight years. Before Game 1, West privately complained to Bill Russell of exhaustion, but then the Lakers guard scored 53 points on Boston in a close two-point win. L.A. also took Game 2, with West scoring 41 points. In Game 3, Russell opted to double-team West, and the guard&#x27;s exhaustion began to show: West twice asked to be subbed for longer periods, and both times the Lakers fell back by double digits and finally lost by six points. Game 4 saw Celtics guard Sam Jones hit an off-balance buzzer beater to tie the series, but in Game 5, the Lakers struck back and won by 13 points. West – who scored 39 points and by far led all players in scoring during the entire series – lunged for a meaningless late-game ball and seriously pulled his hamstring: it was immediately visible that the injury would not heal until the end of the series. Limping, he scored 26 points in Game 6, but the Celtics won 99–90 with a strong Bill Russell, who held Chamberlain to only 8 points in the entire game. In Game 7, Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke had put up thousands of balloons in the rafters of the Forum in Los Angeles. This display of arrogance motivated the Celtics and angered West. The Lakers trailed the entire game and were behind 91–76 after three quarters, but powered by a limping West, the Lakers closed the gap to 103–102 with two minutes to go and had the ball. But West committed costly turnovers and L.A. lost the game 108–106 despite a triple-double of 42 points, 13 rebounds and 12 assists from West, who became the only recipient of the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award from the losing team. After the loss West was seen as the ultimate tragic hero: after the game, Bill Russell held his hand, and John Havlicek said: &quot;I love you, Jerry&quot;.

In the 1969–70 NBA season under new coach Joe Mullaney, the Lakers&#x27; season began with a shock when Wilt Chamberlain seriously injured his knee and missed practically the whole regular season. As after Baylor&#x27;s injury years before, West stepped into the void, leading the NBA in scoring average with 31.2 points per game, and averaging 4.6 rebounds and 7.5 assists per game, earning him his first of four All-Defensive First Team votes and another All-NBA First Team berth after two Second Team years. The Lakers won 46 games, and in the 1970 NBA Playoffs, they narrowly beat the Phoenix Suns in seven games and swept the Hawks in four, setting up the first NBA Finals between the Lakers and the rugged New York Knicks, led by Hall-of-Famers, such as Willis Reed, Dave DeBusschere, Bill Bradley, and Walt Frazier. L.A. and N.Y. split the first two games, with both games respectively decided by centers Reed and the still-hobbling Chamberlain. In Game 3, DeBusschere hit a mid-range jump shot with three seconds left to put the Knicks ahead 102–100, and the Lakers had no time-outs left. Chamberlain inbounded the ball to West, who raced past Walt Frazier and threw up a 60-foot shot. Frazier later commented: &quot;The man&#x27;s crazy. He looks determined. He thinks it&#x27;s going in!&quot; West incredibly connected, and this basket was later called one of the greatest moments ever by the NBA. As the three-point line had not been introduced yet, the shot just tied the game. In overtime, West sprained his left hand and missed all five of his shots, and the Knicks won 111–108. In Game 4, the guard scored 37 points and 18 assists, and the Lakers won. More frustration awaited West in Game 5, when Reed pulled his thigh muscle and seemed out for the series; instead of capitalizing on a double-digit lead and reeling off an easy win, the Lakers committed 19 second-half turnovers, and the two main scorers Chamberlain and West shot the ball only three and two times, respectively, in the entire second half and lost 107–100 in what was called one of the greatest comebacks in NBA Finals history. After Chamberlain scored 45 points and West 31 points plus 13 assists in a series-equalizing 135–113 Lakers win, the Lakers seemed favorites prior to Game 7. West had also injured his right hand and taken several manual injections, and Reed hobbled up court before Game 7: the Knicks center scored the first four points, and inspired his team to one of the most famous playoff upsets of all time. With his injured hands, West still hit nine of his 19 shots, but was outplayed by Walt Frazier, who scored 36 points and 19 assists and was credited with several crucial steals on Lakers guard Dick Garrett.

In the 1970–71 NBA season, the Lakers reacquired Gail Goodrich, who came back from the Phoenix Suns after playing for L.A. until 1968. At age 32, West averaged 26.9 points, 4.6 rebounds and 9.5 assists, and helped the Lakers win 46 games and make the 1971 NBA Playoffs. After losing Elgin Baylor to an Achilles tendon rupture that effectively ended his career, West himself injured his knee and was out for the season; the short-handed Lakers lost the Western Conference Finals in five games to the championship-bound Milwaukee Bucks, who were led by freshly-crowned Most Valuable Player Lew Alcindor (later known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) and veteran Hall-of-Fame guard Oscar Robertson.

==== 1971–74: Late success and twilight years ====

Before the 1971–72 NBA season, West was smarting from his frequent injuries and losses and considered retirement. The Lakers hired former Celtics star guard and future Hall-of-Fame coach Bill Sharman as head coach. Although injured captain Elgin Baylor ended his career, the Lakers had a season for the ages. The team was powered by Sharman&#x27;s emphasis on tough defense and fast break offense, and L.A. embarked on an unprecedented 33 game win streak, en route to a then-record 69 wins in the regular season. West himself contributed with 25.8 points and led the league with a career-high 9.7 assists per game. He was named All-Star, All-NBA and All-Defense First Teamer and voted 1972 All-Star Game MVP. Prior to the Laker&#x27;s 33 game team win streak, in which West started every game, the Lakers played 5 games in which West was injured and did not play. The Lakers lost 3 of the 5 games. Prior to that, West started 8 straight games in which the Lakers won each game. As a result, Jerry West had a personal win streak of 41 games in which he started. This is the longest such personal win streak in major American professional sports history.

In the postseason, the Lakers defeated the Chicago Bulls in a four-game sweep, then went on to face the Milwaukee Bucks, and defeated them in six games. In the 1972 NBA Finals, the Lakers again met the New York Knicks. Although West suffered a terrible shooting slump during Games 1 and 2, the Lakers tied the series at one win each, and in Game 3, he scored 21 points and helped L.A. win Game 3. In this game, he reached 4,002 playoff points, which set an all-time NBA record. After winning Game 4 due to a superb outing from Wilt Chamberlain, West scored 23 points and dished out 9 assists in Game 5, helping the Lakers to win the game and the NBA championship. The championship was West&#x27;s first-ever NBA title. West conceded that he had played a terrible series and credited the team for the success. Years later he said &quot;I played terrible basketball in the Finals, and we won... It was particularly frustrating because I was playing so poorly that the team overcame me. Maybe that&#x27;s what a team is all about.&quot;

Having vanquished this long-time bane, West entered his 13th NBA year. In the 1972–73 NBA season, the main scoring role was taken by Goodrich, and West was now a playmaker instead of a scorer. He averaged 22.8 points, but also averaged 8.8 assists per game, and again was a First Teamer in the All-Star, All-NBA, and All-Defense Teams. The Lakers won 60 games and reached the 1973 NBA Finals against the New York Knicks. In-Game 1 West scored 24  points before fouling out with three minutes left and L.A. won Game 1 115–112. The Knicks took Games 2 and 3, and West strained both of his hamstrings: in Game 4, the shorthanded Lakers were no match for New York, and in Game 5, the valiant, but injured West and Hairston had miserable games, and despite Chamberlain scoring 23 points and grabbing 21 rebounds, the Lakers lost 102–93 and the series.
The 1973–74 NBA season was to be West&#x27;s last as a player. Now 36 years old, the veteran guard averaged 20.3 points, 3.7 rebounds and 6.6 assists per game. In two newly introduced statistics, steals and blocks, he was credited with 2.6 steals and 0.7 blocks per game. Despite playing only 31 games due to a strained groin, West was still regarded as an elite guard, earning another call-up into his final All-Star Game. Without Chamberlain, who had ended his NBA career, the Lakers won 47 games and lost in five games to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and the Milwaukee Bucks. West took on the role of team captain for the first time after deferring to Chamberlain in 1972. However, in his last season West only played 14 minutes in the playoffs, due to rumored contractual frustration with Jack Kent Cooke and groin injuries. After this loss, West retired due to contract disagreements with Cooke, and filed a suit for unpaid back wages. West wanted to renegotiate his contract and keep playing. He said Cooke &quot;basically told my agent to go to hell. I felt I was deceived. When you feel that you&#x27;re deceived you don&#x27;t want any part of the organization that deceived you. I could&#x27;ve played another very good year. Every athlete says that. But I could&#x27;ve, and I knew I could&#x27;ve. But I could never have played for the Lakers again, and I wasn&#x27;t going to play for anybody else.&quot; At the time of his departure, West had scored more points than any other Laker in franchise history.

==Coaching career==
=== Los Angeles Lakers (1976–1979) ===

Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke was known for a keen eye identifying leadership and teaching qualities (he also gave Hall of Famers Sparky Anderson and Joe Gibbs their first managerial/head coaching positions), and asked West to coach and participate in player personnel decisions. In the 1976–77 season, West became coach of the Los Angeles Lakers. In three years, he led the Lakers and star center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to a 145–101 record, making the playoffs all three seasons and reaching the Western Conference finals in 1977.

== Executive career ==
=== Los Angeles Lakers (1979–2000) ===
After his coaching stint, West worked as a scout for three years before becoming general manager of the Lakers before the 1982–83 season, when he succeeded Bill Sharman. West helped to build the great 1980s Lakers dynasty, also known as Showtime, which brought five championship rings (1980, 1982, 1985, 1987, and 1988) to Los Angeles.

Those championship-winning Lakers were coached by Pat Riley, and featured superstar players Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy. After a slump in the early 1990s, West rebuilt the team of coach Del Harris around center Vlade Divac, forward Cedric Ceballos, and guard Nick Van Exel, which won 48 games, and went to the Western Conference semifinals. In 1995, West received his first Executive of the Year Award for his role in turning the Lakers around.

West continued to propel the Lakers to championship contender status by trading Divac for the draft rights to Kobe Bryant (1996), by signing free agent center Shaquille O&#x27;Neal (also in 1996), and by signing six-time NBA champion Phil Jackson as a coach (1999). West departed from the Lakers at the end of the 1999–2000 season after he won his sixth championship as a Lakers&#x27; executive. He laid down the foundation of the Lakers&#x27; three-peat, which saw L.A. win three NBA titles from 2000 to 2002.

=== Memphis Grizzlies (2002–2007) ===
In 2002, West became the general manager of the Memphis Grizzlies. He explained his decision with the desire for exploring something new: &quot;After being a part of the Lakers success for so many years, I have always wondered how it would be to build a winning franchise that has not experienced much success. I want to help make a difference.&quot; West&#x27;s Memphis stint was not as spectacular as his Los Angeles stint, but he turned a franchise which was about to be sold into a reliable playoffs team, making few trades but getting the maximum from the players he had available (such as Pau Gasol, James Posey, and Jason Williams) and signing coach Hubie Brown, who became Coach of the Year in 2004. West himself won his second NBA Executive of the Year Award in the same year. In 2007, West retired as a Grizzlies general manager and turned over managing duties to Chris Wallace.

=== Golden State Warriors (2011–2017) ===
On May 19, 2011, West joined the Golden State Warriors as an executive board member, reporting directly to new owners Joe Lacob and Peter Guber. This role also came with an undisclosed minority ownership stake in the team. In 2015, the Warriors won their first championship in 40 years; the championship was the seventh earned by West while serving as a team executive. He earned his eighth in the 2016–17 season.

=== Los Angeles Clippers (2017–2024) ===
On June 1, 2017, West publicly stated that he would have been interested in returning to the Lakers, but nothing materialized as they hired Magic Johnson and Rob Pelinka to run the team. On June 14, West announced that he would go to the Los Angeles Clippers as an executive board member and consultant. Clippers coach, Doc Rivers, floated the idea of West joining the organization during the 2016 season. West referred to leaving Golden State as &quot;one of the saddest days of his life&quot;, but was excited to find a new challenge. On December 17, 2020, it was reported that West and the Los Angeles Clippers were under investigation by the NBA following a lawsuit filed by John Wilkes against the Clippers over the recruitment of Kawhi Leonard to the team.

== Player profile ==
West was an all-around combo guard who could take the playmaking roles of a point guard and score like a shooting guard, while being equally strong on offense and defense. He had a jump shot with a release the NBA lauded as &quot;lightning quick&quot;, and was known for making baskets late in the game, earning him the nickname &quot;Mr. Clutch&quot;. Having played forward early in his career, he was also a capable rebounder, and gifted with long arms, quick hands, and strong defensive instincts. He was also described as one of the best ballhawks, man-to-man defenders and shot blockers among NBA guards: when the All-Defensive Teams were introduced in 1969, he made every one of them until his career ended in 1974. &quot;He stole more than anybody, although they didn&#x27;t keep records on it then&quot;, said Sharman. Contemporaries were most impressed by his work ethic, practicing, shooting and, rarely satisfying himself.

West&#x27;s all-round game and attitude is maybe best expressed in his statistically most spectacular game: he once was credited with 44 points (16 of 17 shots from the field, 12 of 12 free throw attempts) with 12 rebounds, 12 assists, and (unofficially counted) 10 blocked shots, thus scoring a non-official ultra-rare quadruple double. He commented: &quot;Defensively, from a team standpoint, I didn&#x27;t feel I played very well. Very rarely was I satisfied with how I played.&quot;

== Legacy ==

West ended his playing career with 14 All-Star, 12 All-NBA Team and five All-Defensive Team selections, and scored 25,192 points, 6,238 assists and 5,366 rebounds in 932 games, translating to an average of 27.0 points, 6.7 assists and 5.8 rebounds per game. Among retired players, only Michael Jordan, Elgin Baylor and Wilt Chamberlain surpass his 27.0 points per game average. He led the Lakers in scoring in seven seasons, and is the league leader in career scoring in the NBA Finals (1,679). In 1979, West was elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, and the Lakers retired his No. 44 jersey in 1983. He was also elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame as a member of the 1960 U.S. Olympic team in 2010 and as a contributor in 2024; his induction as a contributor honors his tenure as a general manager and consultant. West was the first person to be enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame as a player and a contributor.

The NBA logo, which was designed in 1969, incorporates a silhouette based on a photograph of West, according to its designer Alan Siegel. In March 2008, ESPN voted West the third greatest shooting guard of all time. In 2022, to commemorate the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named West as the 14th greatest player in NBA history. As a coach, West led the Lakers into three consecutive playoff campaigns, and then went on to win eight NBA championships as an executive and consultant. West built the 1980s Lakers dynasty under coach Pat Riley and players Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and James Worthy and the 2000s under coach Phil Jackson and players Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and Kobe Bryant. He was a member of Golden State&#x27;s front office when the Warriors won titles in 2015 and 2017.

In the summer of 2000, the city of Morgantown, West Virginia, and West Virginia Governor Cecil Underwood, dedicated the road outside of the West Virginia University Coliseum, &quot;Jerry West Boulevard&quot;. The same road is shared on the south end of Morgantown with Don Knotts Boulevard, in honor of another WVU alumnus. Also, on November 26, 2005, his number 44 became the first basketball number to be retired by West Virginia University and on February 17, 2007, a bronze statue created by sculptor Jamie Lester was installed outside of the WVU Coliseum. On February 17, 2011, a statue of West was unveiled outside Staples Center at the Star Plaza in Los Angeles, California. On September 5, 2019, West received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Donald Trump in recognition of his contributions to the sport.

==Personal life==

West married his college sweetheart Martha Jane Kane in April 1960 in Morgantown; they divorced in 1976. They had three sons: David, Mark, and Michael.

Jerry married his second wife, Kristine &quot;Karen&quot; Bua, in 1978. They had two sons, Ryan and Jonnie. Ryan is an executive with the Detroit Pistons. Jonnie played guard for West&#x27;s college team, the West Virginia Mountaineers, is director of Basketball Operations for the Golden State Warriors, and married professional golfer Michelle Wie in 2019.

West was often described as an introverted and nervous character, but he also drew the highest praise for his uncompromising work ethic. Regarding his shyness, WVU roommate Jody Gardner testified that West never dated in his entire freshman year, and Lakers coach Fred Schaus once recalled two weeks when his guard never said a word. Apart from being shy, West was always restless: Schaus described him as a &quot;bundle of nerves&quot;, Celtics contemporary Bob Cousy said West &quot;was always on the move&quot;, and fellow Laker and Mountaineer Rod Hundley testified that during bar visits, West would quickly squirm and demand to go elsewhere before everybody else had settled. His first wife Martha Kane recalled that her husband often had difficulties opening up to her. After a big loss, the Wests would drive home and she would try to console him, but West would say &quot;get out&quot; at the home porch and drive away—an experience that &quot;killed&quot; her as a wife.

Early in his career, West&#x27;s West Virginian roots made him a target for some mild jeering. He spoke with a high-pitched voice that became even shriller when he became excited so that Lakers captain Elgin Baylor dubbed West &quot;Tweety Bird&quot;. His Appalachian accent was so thick that one coach interrupted him and asked him to speak English. Baylor once commented: &quot;Rumors are safe with you, Tweety Bird. You pass them on, but nobody can understand you.&quot;

West was also regarded for his extreme mental toughness and his exemplary work ethic. The NBA said he had &quot;obsessive perfectionism, unabashed confidence, and an uncompromising will to win... a level of intensity so high it could melt lead&quot;. Lakers broadcaster Chick Hearn once said: &quot;He took a loss harder than any player I&#x27;ve ever known. He would sit by himself and stare into space. A loss just ripped his guts out.&quot; Even before his sole championship in 1972, the Lakers held a &quot;Jerry West Night&quot;, and eleven-time NBA champion and perennial rival Bill Russell appeared and said: &quot;Jerry, you are, in every sense of the word, truly a champion... If I could have one wish granted, it would be that you would always be happy.&quot;
In 2011, West and bestselling author Jonathan Coleman wrote a memoir entitled &quot;West by West: My Charmed, Tormented Life&quot;. The book had tremendous critical acclaim and became an instant &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller. During an interview on HBO&#x27;s &quot;Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel&quot;, West revealed that as a child he was the victim of physical abuse from his father and has suffered from depression ever since.

West was portrayed in the 2022 HBO docudrama series &quot;Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty&quot; as a temperamental, foul-mouthed executive, prone to angry outbursts and mood swings. On April 19, 2022, West demanded a retraction from the network within two weeks for the &quot;cruel&quot; and &quot;deliberately false&quot; depiction, as played by actor Jason Clarke.

=== Death ===
West died in Los Angeles on June 12, 2024, at the age of 86. A moment of silence was held in West&#x27;s memory before Game 3 of the ongoing NBA Finals between the Celtics and the Dallas Mavericks that night.

<doc id="331368" wikidata="Q1346641" url="?curid=331368" title="Johnnie Cochran">
<text>Johnnie Lee Cochran Jr. ( ; October 2, 1937 – March 29, 2005) was an American attorney from California who was involved in numerous civil rights and police brutality cases throughout his 38-year career spanning from 1964 to 2002. Noted for his skill in the courtroom, he is best known for leading the so-called &quot;Dream Team&quot; during the murder trial of O.J. Simpson.

Cochran also represented Sean Combs, Michael Jackson, Tupac Shakur, Stanley Tookie Williams, Todd Bridges, football player Jim Brown, Snoop Dogg, former heavyweight champion Riddick Bowe, 1992 Los Angeles riot beating victim Reginald Oliver Denny, inmate and activist Geronimo Pratt, and athlete Marion Jones when she faced doping charges during her high school track career.

== Early life and education ==
Cochran was born in 1937 in Shreveport, Louisiana. His father, Johnnie Cochran Sr. (October 20, 1916 – April 29, 2018), was an insurance salesman and his mother sold Avon products. The family relocated to the West Coast during the second wave of the Great Migration, settling in Los Angeles in 1949. Cochran was six years old when his family moved into a three-bedroom, one-bath, wood-frame house in West Adams, which was a middle-class neighborhood at that time. Cochran went to local schools and graduated first in his class from Los Angeles High School in 1955. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in business economics from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1959 and a Juris Doctor from the Loyola Law School in 1962. He was a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity, initiated through the Upsilon chapter and the fraternity&#x27;s 45th Laurel Wreath laureate.

== Legal practice ==

Inspired by Thurgood Marshall and the legal victory that Marshall won in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, Cochran decided to dedicate his life to practicing law. Cochran felt his career was a calling, a double opportunity to work for what he considered to be right and to challenge what he considered wrong; he could make a difference by practicing law. In &quot;A Lawyer&#x27;s Life&quot;, Cochran wrote, &quot;I read everything that I could find about Thurgood Marshall and confirmed that a single dedicated man could use the law to change society.&quot;

Despite setbacks as a lawyer, Cochran vowed not to cease what he was doing, saying: &quot;I made this commitment and I must fulfill it.&quot;

=== Early career ===

After passing the California bar exam in 1963, Cochran took a position in Los Angeles as a deputy city attorney in the criminal division. In 1964, the young Cochran prosecuted one of his first celebrity cases, Lenny Bruce, a comedian who had recently been arrested on obscenity charges. Two years later, Cochran entered private practice. Soon thereafter, he opened his own firm, Cochran, Atkins &amp; Evans, in Los Angeles.

In his first notable case, Cochran represented an African-American widow who sued several police officers who had shot and killed her husband, Leonard Deadwyler. Though Cochran lost the case, it became a turning point in his career. Rather than seeing the case as a defeat, Cochran realized the trial itself had awakened the black community. In reference to the loss, Cochran wrote in &quot;The American Lawyer,&quot; &quot;those were extremely difficult cases to win in those days. But what Deadwyler confirmed for me was that this issue of police abuse really galvanized the minority community. It taught me that these cases could really get attention.&quot;

By the late 1970s, Cochran had established his reputation in the black community. He litigated a number of high-profile police brutality and criminal cases.

=== Los Angeles County District Attorney&#x27;s office ===
In 1978, Cochran returned to the Los Angeles County District Attorney&#x27;s office in the leadership position of First Assistant District Attorney. Though he took a pay cut to do so, joining the government was his way of becoming &quot;one of the good guys, one of the very top rung.&quot; He began to strengthen his ties with the political community, alter his image, and work from within to change the system.

=== Return to private practice ===
Five years later, Cochran returned to private practice, reinventing himself as &quot;the best in the West&quot; by opening the Johnnie L Cochran Jr. law firm. In contrast to his early loss in the Deadwyler case, Cochran won 760,000 for the family of Ron Settles, a black college football player who, his family claimed, was murdered by the police. In 1990, Cochran joined a succeeding firm, Cochran, Mitchell &amp; Jenna, and joined Cochran, Cherry, Givens &amp; Smith in 1997. The Cochran Firm has grown to have regional offices located in fifteen states.

In most of his cases Cochran represented plaintiffs in tort actions and opposed tort reform. Due to his success as a lawyer, Cochran could encourage settlement simply by his presence on a case. According to Rev. Jesse Jackson, a call to Johnnie Cochran made &quot;corporations and violators shake.&quot;

Cochran&#x27;s well-honed rhetoric and flamboyance in the courtroom has been described as theatrical. His practice as a lawyer earned him great wealth. With his earnings, he bought and drove cars such as a Jaguar and a Rolls-Royce. He owned homes in Los Angeles, two apartments in West Hollywood and a condo in Manhattan. In 2001, Cochran&#x27;s accountant estimated that within five years he would be worth 25–50 million.

== Clients ==
Before the Simpson case, Cochran had achieved a reputation as a &quot;go-to&quot; lawyer for the rich, as well as a successful advocate for minorities in police brutality and civil rights cases. But the controversial and dramatic Simpson trial made Cochran more widely known, generating a more polarized perception of him.
Cochran liked to say that he worked &quot;not only for the OJs, but also the No Js&quot;. In other words, he enjoyed defending or suing in the name of those who did not have fame or wealth. Cochran believed his &quot;most glorious&quot; moment as a lawyer was when he won the freedom of Geronimo Pratt. Cochran said he considered Pratt&#x27;s release &quot;the happiest day&quot; of his legal practice. In the words of Harvard Law School professor Charles Ogletree, Cochran &quot;was willing to fight for the underdog.&quot; Jesse Jackson called Cochran the &quot;people&#x27;s lawyer.&quot; Magic Johnson said Cochran was known &quot;for representing O. J. and Michael [Jackson], but he was bigger and better than that&quot;.

=== O. J. Simpson ===
In October 1995, after a public trial that lasted nearly nine months and presented both circumstantial and physical evidence that Simpson had killed both victims, Simpson was controversially acquitted. During closing arguments in the Simpson trial, Cochran uttered the now famous phrase, &quot;If it doesn&#x27;t fit, you must acquit.&quot; He used the phrase, which had been devised by fellow defense team member Gerald Uelmen, as a way to persuade the jury that Simpson could not have murdered Nicole Brown Simpson nor Ron Goldman. In a dramatic scene, Simpson appeared to have difficulty getting the glove on; stained with the blood of both victims and Simpson, it had been found at the crime scene.

Cochran did not represent Simpson in the subsequent civil trial, in which Simpson was found liable for the deaths. Cochran was criticized during the criminal trial by pundits, as well as by prosecutor Christopher Darden, for suggesting that the police were trying to frame Simpson because they were racist. During the trial, Cochran successfully convinced the jury that the prosecution did not prove Simpson was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and that the police planted evidence against him.

Robert Shapiro, co-counsel on Simpson&#x27;s defense team, accused Cochran of dealing the &quot;race card&quot; &quot;from the bottom of the deck&quot;. Cochran replied that it was &quot;not a case about race, it is a case about reasonable doubt&quot;, adding, &quot;there are a lot of white people who are willing to accept this verdict&quot;.

=== Abner Louima ===
Cochran represented Abner Louima, a Haitian immigrant living in Brooklyn who was sodomized with a broken broomstick by officer Justin Volpe while in police custody. Louima was awarded an $8.75 million settlement, the largest police brutality settlement in New York City history. Tension broke out between Louima&#x27;s original lawyers and the new team headed by Cochran. The former team felt that Cochran and his colleagues were trying to take control of the entire trial.

=== Sean Combs ===
In 2001, Sean (P. Diddy) Combs was indicted on bribery and stolen weapons charges. He hired Cochran for his defense. Cochran fought for Combs&#x27;s freedom, and Combs was acquitted.

In 2002, Cochran told Combs that this would be his last criminal case. Cochran retired after the trial. R. Kelly and Allen Iverson later asked for his services in criminal cases, but he declined to represent them.

=== Stanley Tookie Williams ===
Cochran defended 17-year-old Stanley Tookie Williams in a robbery trial in the early 1970s. Williams was a known member of the Westside Crips street gang. After less than 10 minutes of deliberation, a jury acquitted Williams of all charges.

Years later, Williams was arrested for assaulting LAPD personnel, and was acquitted, with Cochran again serving as his counsel.

Cochran did not represent Williams at his multiple murder trials in the 1980s.

=== Michael Jackson ===
Cochran also represented Michael Jackson when he was accused of child molestation in 1993. Jackson and his accuser settled the case out of court. When Jackson faced criminal charges for further molestation allegations in 2004, his family sought advice from Cochran, who recommended defense attorney Thomas Mesereau.

== Illness and death ==
In December 2003, Cochran was diagnosed with a brain tumor. In April 2004, he underwent surgery, which led him to stay away from the media. Shortly thereafter, he told the &quot;New York Post&quot; that he was feeling well and was in good health.

He died from the brain tumor on March 29, 2005, at his home in Los Angeles. Public viewing of his casket was conducted on April 4, at the Angelus Funeral Home and April 5, at Second Baptist Church, in Los Angeles. A memorial service was held at West Angeles Cathedral, in Los Angeles, on April 6, 2005. His remains were interred in the Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California. The funeral was attended by his father, Johnnie Sr., as well as numerous former friends and clients, including O. J. Simpson and Michael Jackson.

== Posthumous ruling ==
On May 31, 2005, two months after Cochran&#x27;s death, the U.S. Supreme Court delivered its opinion in &quot;Tory v. Cochran&quot;. The court ruled 7–2 that in light of Cochran&#x27;s death, an injunction limiting the demonstrations of Ulysses Tory &quot;amounts to an overly broad prior restraint upon speech.&quot; Two justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, said that Cochran&#x27;s death made it unnecessary for the court to rule. Lower courts, before Cochran died, held that Tory could not make any public comments about Cochran.

== Legacy ==

* On January 24, 2006, Los Angeles Unified School District officials unanimously approved the renaming of Mount Vernon Middle School, Cochran&#x27;s boyhood middle school, to Johnnie L Cochran Jr. Middle School in his honor. The decision received mixed responses.
* In 2007, the three-block stretch of the street in front of the school was renamed &quot;Johnnie Cochran Vista&quot;.
* In 2007, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles opened the new Johnnie L Cochran Jr. Brain Tumor Center, a research center headed by noted neurosurgeon Keith Black, who had been Cochran&#x27;s doctor.
* Cochran&#x27;s family created an endowed chair, the Johnnie L Cochran Jr. Chair in Civil Rights, at his alma mater, Loyola Law School of Loyola Marymount University.
* Cochran&#x27;s footprints are featured on the Northwest Louisiana Walk of Stars in his hometown of Shreveport, Louisiana.

== Depictions in media ==

After the Simpson trial, Cochran was a frequent commentator in law-related television shows. Additionally, he hosted his own show, &quot;Johnnie Cochran Tonight&quot;, on CourtTV. With the Simpson fame also came movie deals.

Actor Phil Morris played attorney Jackie Chiles, a character parody of Cochran, in several episodes of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. He was satirized in the &quot;Chef Aid&quot; episode of the animated sitcom &quot;South Park,&quot; in which he appears using a confusing legal strategy called &quot;the Chewbacca defense&quot;, a direct parody of his closing argument when defending O.J. Simpson. Cochran took these parodies in stride, discussing them in his autobiography, &quot;A Lawyer&#x27;s Life&quot;. Additionally, he appeared as himself in &quot;The Hughleys&quot;, &quot;Family Matters&quot;, &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, &quot;Arli$$&quot;, &quot;CHiPs &#x27;99&quot;, &quot;Bamboozled&quot;, &quot;Showtime&quot;, &quot;Martin&quot;, and &quot;JAG&quot;.

Ving Rhames played Cochran in the film&quot; American Tragedy&quot; (2000).

Cochran is mentioned in the 2011 musical comedy &quot;The Book of Mormon&quot;, where he is depicted as being in hell alongside Genghis Khan, Jeffrey Dahmer, and Adolf Hitler for &quot;getting O. J. free&quot;.

Cochran was portrayed in &quot;The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story&quot; (2016) by actor Courtney B. Vance. In the series, Cochran is depicted as fully aware that Simpson is responsible for the murders and initially reluctant to be part of the Dream Team, believing that they will lose. Cochran also serves as a composite character with Gerald Uelman, who was omitted from the series, taking Uelman&#x27;s place as the lawyer who cross-examines Fuhrman for the second time, and who comes up with &quot;If it doesn&#x27;t fit, you must acquit.&quot; Vance won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for his performance.

On November 6, 1995, in season 3, episode 8, &quot;The Party&#x27;s Over&quot; of &quot;The Nanny&quot;, the final joke is Cochran&#x27;s line from O.J. Simpson&#x27;s trial: &quot;If it doesn&#x27;t fit, you must acquit.&quot; To Fran&#x27;s dismay, her elderly lawyer uncle refers to her skimpy skirt barely covering her buttocks, only to fall asleep in mid-session afterwards.

In 2002, Good Charlotte released a song, &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous&quot;, in which a line makes reference to Cochran&#x27;s defence of O.J. Simpson, saying: &quot;Well, did you know, when you were famous, you could kill your wife? And there&#x27;s no such thing as 25-to-life – as long as you&#x27;ve got the cash to pay for Cochran.&quot;

On the opening track of Kanye West&#x27;s Yeezus (2013), the rapper compares his lover&#x27;s ability to pleasure African American men to Cochran&#x27;s ability to get an innocent verdict for his African American clients in the line: &quot;She got more niggas off than Cochran, huh?&quot;

<doc id="331369" wikidata="Q2953800" url="?curid=331369" title="I spy">
<text>I spy is a guessing game where one player (the &quot;spy&quot; or &quot;it&quot;) chooses an object within sight and announces to the other players that &quot;I spy with my little eye something beginning with...&quot;, naming the first letter of the object. Other players attempt to guess this object. It is often played as a car game.

==Rules==
One player is chosen to be the Spy, and they silently select an object that is visible to all the players. He or she does not announce their choice, and instead say, &quot;I spy with my little eye something beginning with ...&quot;, naming the letter the chosen object starts with (e.g. &quot;I spy with my little eye something beginning with C&quot; if the chosen object is a cow).

Other players then have to guess the chosen object. Traditionally players ask directly about particular possibilities (&quot;Is it a cat?&quot;). Once a guesser has correctly identified the object, they become the Spy for the next round and the game starts again. If younger children are playing who are not so good at guessing, the role of Spy can be passed around in a set order.

The Spy cannot change the object once it has been chosen. The game relies on trust as the Spy is the only person who knows whether the guessers are correct or not.

===Variants===
In situations where players are traveling from place to place through the course of the game, such as a car journey, players may agree that any chosen object should remain visible, rather than an item such as a particular street sign which will only be visible for a few moments when the game begins. Players may also agree to decide if the objects will be all outside or all inside the vehicle. 

Some versions of the game allow players to narrow down the search with yes-or-no questions such as &quot;Is it on your left?&quot; or &quot;Is it an animal?&quot;. The Spy can also offer clues if the guessers are stumped, such as saying ‘Hot’ when a guess is close or ‘Cold’ if it is not. 

An alternative version is substituting the initial letter for an adjective such as the colour of the object (e.g. &quot;I spy with my little eye something blue&quot;), while another is to say &quot;I Spy with my little eye something that sounds like&quot;. Some sites such as About Parenting describe the letter version as the variant to the colour-based game. This site has the form &quot;I spy something, and it&#x27;s blue&quot; as the traditional version, deeming &quot;I spy with my little eye...&quot; as an alternative. Having clues based on an object&#x27;s shape is another alternative, while quick thinkers can deliberately choose objects that can only be seen for a limited amount of time. Howcast notes that looking at an object when announcing its colour is a &quot;dead giveaway&quot; so this should be avoided.

Another variation that encourages language development involves the Spy giving various descriptive clues, such as describing a watch as &quot;something made of metal and glass that makes a quiet noise&quot;.

==Purpose==

&quot;About Parenting&quot; notes, &quot;I Spy is one of the first games that most children learn to play&quot;, and recommends the game for &quot;doctor&#x27;s offices, restaurants and other places where you sometimes have to wait with kids&quot;, but discourages its use in moving cars. The game &quot;requires no equipment and can be played almost anywhere and with as many people as you want&quot;, both with adults and children, though a minimum of 2 players is required. I spy is often played with young children as a means to avert boredom in long journeys. A survey by British insurance company Direct Line found that 58% of families played I spy, and 65% of the parents consulted had played it on journeys as a child. Raising Children Network recommends a colour-based variation of the game for pre-schoolers, and a variation encouraging the learning of sounds for school age kids (&quot;I spy with my little eye something beginning with f-f-f. What do you think I’m looking at that starts with that sound?&quot;) The fun comes with trying to discover the identity of a mysterious object. The game allows kids to practice their oral/aural skills.

Mary Tomczyk argues I Spy is a clever reasoning game that allows kids to solve puzzles, and gives them an opportunity to &quot;&#x27;stump&#x27; Mom or Dad&quot;. She says children &quot;learn to be more observant about the world around them, learn about colours, shapes, and textures, and use logic and reasoning to draw conclusions&quot;. She recommends it for preschool and kindergarten kids. Despite its simplicity and repetitiveness, the game grows a child&#x27;s vocabulary and can also serve as a distraction for an impatient child. Howcast argues &quot;It will keep their minds occupied just about anywhere.&quot; The game can be played in almost any environment, indoors or outdoors, including indoors on a rainy day.

==History==
The game &quot;I Spy&quot; is first recorded in the early 20th century. The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) defines it, under &quot;Spy&quot; giving the earliest citation as a mention in Rosamond Lehmann&#x27;s 1946 work &quot;The Gipsy&#x27;s Baby&quot;. A &quot;Brief Manual of Games for Organized Play&quot; lists a game named &quot;I See&quot; which is similar to &quot;I Spy&quot;. One etymological website though reports an earlier mention in a 1937 Canadian publication. The concept likely originated from the spy-mania that occurred during and after World War II. In a 1985 The Free Lance-Star article &quot;Games to play on the road&quot;, I Spy is described as a variant of The Detective Game, and has the player say &quot;I spy something, the color _____. Can you guess what I spy?&quot; Detective involves the player telling one of their children they are looking for a certain object and giving them clues until they get it right. After succeeding, the child becomes the clue giver. This version can only be played with two people.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; also records &quot;I Spy&quot; as a variant spelling for the different children&#x27;s game of &quot;Hy Spy&quot;, with citations going back to 1777. Phrase Finder notes &quot;The guessing game was preceded by another children&#x27;s game called I Spy (or Hy Spy), a variant of what is now called Hide and Seek and was known in the UK from the 18th century.&quot; A 1931 edition of The Age describes I Spy (literally &quot;Eye Spy&quot;) as a dynamic variant of Hide and Seek. Another variant was played at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1972 where children heard a tape and watched slides that gave them hints to certain art pieces. One 19th century children&#x27;s book is titled &quot;I Spy With My Little Eye&quot;.

==Popular culture==
There are many games that are based on this concept, examples being the &quot;I-Spy&quot; series of gamebooks that ask players to find objects in a &quot;Where&#x27;s Wally?&quot;-esque setting, and an I Spy computer game.

The game was the namesake for the song &quot;iSpy&quot;, featuring American rappers Kyle and Lil Yachty, which features the wording in its chorus.

The game and its wording are well known in western popular culture, for example the title of the 2002 horror film &quot;My Little Eye&quot; uses part of the wording from the game. 

A US short film directed by Alexander Nebel titled &quot;I Spy&quot; has the following synopsis: &quot;Full of imagination, Mia convinces bored Ingo to play the game of ‘I Spy’. More and more the game dissolves the ordinary kitchen into a wildly animated sea-adventure dream reality.&quot;

In 2007, The Wiggles: a popular children&#x27;s music brand included the song &quot;I Spy&quot; based on the game. The song is available on The Wiggles&#x27; &quot;Getting Strong (Wiggle and Learn)&quot; DVD and audio CD.

There&#x27;s also a &quot;John Cleese on How to Irritate People&quot; sketch in which two bored airline pilots are playing I Spy as a pastime while on cruise flight.

The term &#x27;I spy with my little eye&#x27; has been used by singer Robbie Williams in his song &quot;Love Supreme&quot;.

The video game &quot;Minecraft&quot; has an in-game achievement that is named &quot;Eye Spy&quot;. The horror video game &quot;Andy&#x27;s Apple Farm&quot; also features a minigame where the player plays some rounds of &quot;I spy&quot;.

Strawberry Shortcake attempts to play the game during one episode of &quot;Strawberry Shortcake: Berry in the Big City&quot; when she gets trapped in a traffic jam.

<text>Car games are games played to pass the time on long car journeys, often started by parents to amuse restless children. They generally require little or no equipment or playing space. Some such games are designed specifically to be played while traveling (e.g. the license plate game, the Alphabet Game, or &quot;car tag&quot; games like Punch Buggy), while others are games that can be played in a variety of settings including car journeys (e.g. twenty questions).

==Alphabet Game==

In the alphabet game, each player has to find the letters of the alphabet among signs and other pieces of text in the environment around them, working through the alphabet in order from A to Z. Players may take turns, each turn lasting five miles of driving distance, or may play cooperatively with each other.
==Car tag==
A common car game is car tag. Car tag is when people look out for particular models of car on the road. The game ends when the travellers reach their destination, and the person who spotted the most wins. Cars in a dealership lot are usually not counted.

House rules may make certain car models trigger other effects beyond or instead of awarding points, most famously in the game variant known as &quot;Punch Buggy&quot; where spotting a Volkswagen Beetle allows the spotter to punch another passenger.

==I Spy==
I Spy is a common car game, one person calling out &quot;I spy with my little eye something beginning with...&quot; then naming a letter, and others attempting to guess the object that was spied.

Players may agree that any chosen object should remain visible during the journey, rather than something that will be passed and not seen again during the journey. Players may also agree to decide if the objects will be all outside or all inside the vehicle.

==The Parson&#x27;s Cat==
The Parson&#x27;s Cat, also called The Minister&#x27;s Cat, is a Victorian parlour game in which players describe a cat using each letter of the alphabet. In differing variations, players may each describe the cat using a different letter (i.e., &quot;amiable&quot;, &quot;beautiful&quot;, &quot;curious&quot;), or may all describe the cat using the same letter until they cannot think of more, at which point they move on to the next letter (&quot;amiable&quot;, &quot;alluring&quot;, ... &quot;antiquated&quot;, &quot;beautiful&quot;). In other variations, players may be required to recite all previous descriptions of the cat before adding the next adjective.

==My Cows==
The My Cows car game can be played with any combination of rules, from complicated to simple, but at the game&#x27;s core, players score points when they see a herd of cows and say &quot;My Cows&quot;. Point modifiers can be added or subtracted from a player depending on other landmarks. For example a player may see a house of worship and say &quot;My Church&quot; to send your cows to be married, doubling your points or when passing a cemetery say &quot;Your Cemetery&quot; to eliminate an opponents cows/points. The game typically ends when you reach your destination.

Versions of this game may have regional, or even localized, variations to the name, including, &quot;Cows, Silos, and Cemeteries&quot; or simply &quot;Cows on My Side&quot;.

==Sign cricket==
Sign cricket is a British game where players earn points according to the numbers of legs belonging to the people or animals in the pub&#x27;s name. For example, a &quot;Horse and Groom&quot; pub would score 6 points: 4 for the four-legged horse, plus 2 for the two-legged groom.

<text>The 2003 Prince Edward Island general election was held on September 29, 2003 to elect the 27 members of the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island. The election was called on September 2 by Premier Pat Binns, who enjoyed a high level of popularity among voters.

Polling took place on September 29, despite a blackout across two-thirds of the province and other damage caused by Hurricane Juan.

Binns&#x27; Progressive Conservatives were elected to a third consecutive majority government, the first time this had happened in Island history (for the PC party). The Premier, who ran in Murray River-Gaspereaux, was re-elected, along with his entire existing cabinet.

The Liberals wrested three seats from the Tories, increasing their standing to four seats. The party&#x27;s new leader, Robert Ghiz, was one of those. The son of former premier Joe Ghiz beat Charlottetown mayor George MacDonald in the riding of Charlottetown-Rochford Square in Charlottetown.

The New Democrats did not win any seats; their leader, Gary Robichaud, was defeated by a Tory incumbent in Wilmot-Summerside.

<doc id="331372" wikidata="Q1432611" url="?curid=331372" title="National Centre Party (Ireland)">
<text>The National Centre Party, initially known as the National Farmers and Ratepayers League, was a short-lived political party in the Irish Free State. It was founded on 15 September 1932 in the Mansion House, Dublin, with the support of several sitting TDs, including the three Farmers&#x27; Party members and thirteen Independents, all of whom feared for their political future if they did not coordinate in a common organisation. Prominent among the latter were party leader Frank MacDermot, a TD for Roscommon since the general election of February 1932, and James Dillon, a TD for Donegal, who was the son of John Dillon, the last leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party.

The party&#x27;s policies included the establishment of a central bank (at this time, the Free State was still part of the sterling area, and the Bank of Ireland served as lender to the government), deflation through pay cuts, protectionism, an end to the Anglo-Irish Trade War and the removal of rates on agricultural land. The party was strongly opposed to Fianna Fáil, despite apparent similarities of policy, perhaps because most National Centre Party deputies represented rural constituencies. Fianna Fáil, with its strength among small farmers and increasing popularity among the rural middle-class, was the most obvious threat to a rural-based party at this time.

In the 1933 general election, the new party won eleven seats. During this election, the party&#x27;s opponents in Fianna Fáil disrupted National Centre Party meetings, often with the assistance of the prohibited Irish Republican Army. These incidents contributed to the rise of the Army Comrades Association (more commonly known as the Blueshirts), which was formed to protect the establishment conservative parties from the perceived threat of political violence. Fianna Fáil formed a majority government after the election. During the first Fianna Fáil government, the National Centre Party aligned with the largest opposition party, Cumann na nGaedheal, on almost all issues of political or economic importance. However, Frank MacDermot rejected a suggestion that the two parties should merge.

The opposition parties united in mutual self-defence when the government banned the Army Comrades Association in August 1933. The two parties and the ACA merged to form Fine Gael in September, just eleven months after the formation of the National Centre Party. Included in the six National Centre Party members of the first Fine Gael National Executive were FB Barton, P Baxter and EJ Cussen. 

Although MacDermot became a vice-president of Fine Gael at its foundation, he differed from most of his party colleagues on issues such as the degree of emphasis to be given to Ireland&#x27;s membership of the British Commonwealth. He ultimately resigned from the party, to sit as an independent.

<text>Thomas &quot;Old Tom&quot; Parr ( (reputedly) – 13 November 1635) was an Englishman who was said to have lived for 152 years. A portrait of Parr hangs at Shrewsbury Museum and Art Gallery, with an inscription which reads &quot;Thomas Parr died at the age of 152 years 19 days&quot; &quot;The old very old man or Thomas Parr, son of John Parr of Winnington in the Parish of Alberbury who was born in the year 1483 in the reign of King Edward IV being 152 years old in the year 1635.&quot; The portrait was once in the collection of the Leighton family of Loton Park, which is in Alberbury.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===

Records vary, but Parr was allegedly born around October 1482 or 1483, although he may have been born as recently as , in the parish of Alberbury; he lived in the small hamlet of Winnington, in what is called now Old Parr&#x27;s Cottage, within Shropshire. He existed and even thrived on a diet of &quot;subrancid cheese and milk in every form, coarse and hard bread and small drink, generally sour whey,&quot; as the physician William Harvey wrote. &quot;On this sorry fare, but living in his home, free from care, did this poor man attain to such length of days.&quot; He married Jane Taylor at the claimed age of 80 and had two children, both of whom died in infancy.

=== Later life ===
Thomas Parr purportedly had an affair when he was more than 100 years old, and fathered a child born out of wedlock, for which he had to do public penance in the church porch. After the death of his first known wife at the alleged age of 110, he married Jane Lloyd, a widow, at the alleged age of 122. They lived together for 12 years, with Jane commenting that he never showed any signs of age or infirmity. As news of his reported age spread, &#x27;Old Parr&#x27; became a national celebrity and was painted by Rubens and Van Dyck.

=== Death ===
In 1635, Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel, visited Parr and took him to London to meet King Charles I, presented as a &quot;curious piece of nature&quot;. The Earl arranged for Parr&#x27;s daughter-in-law to accompany him on the southward trip, as well as an entertainer known as Jack the Fool, to amuse Parr on the journey. The carriage and escort attracted large crowds as it travelled towards London, with people stifling the old man in an attempt to touch him and hear him speak. By the time he finally arrived in the capital, Parr was reportedly blind and feeble. King Charles I was reported to have asked Parr: &quot;Master Parr, you have lived longer than other men. What have you done more than other men?&quot; He replied that he had performed penance for an affair with Catherine Milton, a village maiden. The King was stern, stating: &quot;Fie, fie old man. Can you remember nothing but your vices?&quot;

Parr was treated as a spectacle in London, but the food and environment caused him to die within only a few weeks, on 13 November 1635. The King arranged for him to be buried in Westminster Abbey on . The inscription of his gravestone reads:

==Doubts of his age==

William Harvey (1578–1657), the physician who discovered the circulation of the blood, performed an autopsy on Parr&#x27;s body. The results were published in the book &quot;De ortu et natura sanguinis&quot; by John Betts as an attachment. Harvey examined Parr&#x27;s body and found all his internal organs to be in a perfect state. No apparent cause of death could be determined, and it was assumed that Parr had simply died of overexposure because he had been too well fed. A modern interpretation of the results of the autopsy suggests that Parr was probably less than 70 years of age.

It is possible that Parr&#x27;s birth records were confused with those of his grandfather. Parr did not claim to be able to remember specific events from the 15th century.

<text>Killarney is a municipality located on the northern shore of Georgian Bay in the Sudbury District of Ontario, Canada. Killarney is commonly associated with Killarney Provincial Park, which is a large wilderness park located to the east of the townsite which occupies much of the municipality&#x27;s expanded boundary.

In addition to the community of Killarney itself, the communities of Hartley Bay and Bigwood, and the ghost towns of French River, Collins Inlet, and Key Harbour, are also located within the municipal boundaries. The eastern end of the La Cloche Mountain Range is also located within the municipality of Killarney.

==History==

Killarney&#x27;s established community was founded in 1820 by Étienne De La Morandière (although indigenous peoples were living there prior), a French Canadian originally from Varennes, Quebec and a fur trader in Sault Ste Marie, Michigan, along with his wife Josette Sai Sai Go No Kwe, an indigenous woman from Michigan and a close relative of Chief Kitchi, meaning Big Gun. Soon after the arrival of the De La Morandières, many French-Canadian families started to settle in Killarney, starting many fishing businesses in the process. Although there was already an existing settlement here at that time, they are credited with the founding of the settlement.

The population increased when the logging industry took off in Colins Inlet in the late 1800s. Hundreds of people from around Ontario went to Colins Inlet for work and established a large community in the area. The logging industry collapsed in the early 1900s because of the low demand and the population declined. Remains of the large village can be seen across from the present-day Mill Lake lodge.

In 1929, the place was originally incorporated as the Township of Rutherford and George Island.

Another key industry that had a major impact on Killarney&#x27;s economy was the fishing industry. There were many fishing companies in Killarney including C.W.L (Charles William Low), The Nobles, Charles Low/Joseph Roque partnership, and Albert Lowe. The collapse of the fishing industry at the end of the 1950s affected many families in Killarney including the Low, Roque, Jackman, Proulx, and Herbert families. Recreational fishing was also an industry. A fishing camp was run by the Fruehauf Trailer Company out of Detroit, Michigan. Roy Fruehauf, president of the company from 1949 to 1961, was primarily responsible for operating Killarney Mountain Lodge. Clients and guests would be flown in via Mallard sea planes for vacations during the warmer summer months.

A quarry in Killarney Bay had fixed this issue for many families by creating more employment opportunities in the area. The quarry is located on the westside of the Landsdowne channel and had been very financially efficient after the downfall of the fishing industry.The quarry eventually was shut down in 2016 over a labour dispute and the industry that replaced it was tourism.

The major tourism businesses in Killarney were the Killarney mountain lodge, the Sportsmans Inn, the Killarney Bay Inn, the Pines Inn, Herbert fisheries, and Pitfield&#x27;s General Store. The booming tourism industry brought hundreds of thousands of dollars to the businesses of Killarney as well as the many families that contributed to it. The current tourism businesses of Killarney include the Killarney Mountain Lodge, the Sportsmans Inn, Gateway Marina, Herbert fisheries, and Pitfield&#x27;s General Store.

When and why the place name Shebahonaning was changed to Killarney is unknown. Lady Dufferin, wife of the Governor-General of Canada, has often been credited with the name change, but the passage in her journal which describes their stop in Killarney is dated 1874—almost twenty years after the Post Office had replaced the Shebahonaning postal stamp with one reading Killarney.

In July 1962, Highway 637 was established, connecting Killarney to major highways like Highway 69 and Highway 17, making it easier for people to travel to major cities like Toronto or Sudbury.  Before that, the people of the town had to either go by boat in the summer to Little Current and then take a train to Sudbury or other areas to obtain food and resources or by horse and buggy in the winter.

On January 1, 1999, the Ontario provincial government merged the Township of Rutherford and George Island (having an area of in the 1996 census) with large tracts of surrounding unincorporated areas, forming the new Municipality of Killarney (with an area of in 2001 census). The municipality was also transferred from the Manitoulin District to the Sudbury District at that time. In 2006, the municipality was enlarged again (to ) when it annexed the unorganized mainland portion of Manitoulin District. By the 2021 census, its territory was reduced to due to the incorporation of Point Grondine 3 reserve.

==Geography==

The larger municipality of Killarney now encompasses virtually all of Killarney Provincial Park and the French River delta, and extends all the way to Highway 69, over from the townsite. Despite the municipality&#x27;s geographic size, most of its population continues to reside in the community of Killarney itself, although smaller settlements also exist at Hartley Bay and Bigwood.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Killarney had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.


==Economy==
The Killarney area economy is based primarily on tourism, consisting mainly of wilderness lodges, campgrounds, and retail services geared towards campers and other visitors to Killarney.

A community museum, the Killarney Centennial Museum, is located in Killarney across the municipal offices.

=== Fishing industry ===

There were many fishing companies in Killarney, including C.W.L. (Charles William Low), the Nobles, Charles Low Joseph Roque partnership, and Albert Lowe. Most of these people at some point worked together in Killarney to sustain the fishing needs of the community. The main difference between the many different fishing businesses in Killarney was how they fished. Many fishing families and businesses in town built fishing outposts in the area of Georgian Bay surrounding the village of Killarney. The collapse of the fishing industry at the end of the 1950s affected many families in Killarney including the low, Roques, Jackman, Proulx, and Herbert families. The collapse caused many families of Killarney to either go broke or have to look into other means of employment in order to support their families.

==Government==
The Mayor of Killarney is Michael Reider, and the councillors are Ward 1: Rob Campbell, Dave Froats, and Peggy Roque Ward 2: Mary Bradbury and Nicola Grubic.

Although not officially part of the Sudbury East region, Killarney participates in the regional Sudbury East Planning Board with the municipalities of French River, St. Charles and Markstay-Warren.

* Michael Reider: 2022 (incumbent)

== Tourism ==

One tourism website listed 21 things to do in the area although much of the contest related to provincial parks.

There are also three campgrounds in Killarney, Killarney Provincial Park, Roche Rouge campground, and Roque&#x27;s Marina. Roque&#x27;s Marina amenities include camping with 15 or 30 amp power, EV Charge, transient and seasonal dockage, 24hr coin operated laundromat, showers, and indoor toilets, along with block and cube ice.

There are two places to stay overnight in Killarney the Killarney Mountain Lodge and the Sportsman&#x27;s inn which are sister resorts. Guests from either one can use the amenities of both.

Although not officially part of the Sudbury east region, Killarney participates in the regional Sudbury East planning board with the municipalities of French River St Charles and Mark stay Warren.

During the Spring and Summer of 2020 the area&#x27;s tourism suffered because of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada and around the world the restrictions on travel to Canada from other countries including the US severely affected the economy of Killarney.

<text>Malcolm Scott Carpenter (May 1, 1925 – October 10, 2013) was an American naval officer and aviator, test pilot, aeronautical engineer, astronaut and aquanaut. He was one of the Mercury Seven astronauts selected for NASA&#x27;s Project Mercury in April 1959. Carpenter was the second American (after John Glenn) to orbit the Earth and the fourth American in space, after Alan Shepard, Gus Grissom and John Glenn.

Commissioned into the U.S. Navy in 1949, Carpenter became a naval aviator, flying a Lockheed P-2 Neptune with Patrol Squadron 6 (VP-6) on reconnaissance and anti-submarine warfare missions along the coasts of Soviet Union and China during the Korean War and the Cold War. In 1954, he attended the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, and became a test pilot. In 1958, he was named Air Intelligence Officer of , which was then in dry dock at the Bremerton Navy Yard.

The following year, Carpenter was selected as one of the Mercury Seven astronauts. He was backup to Glenn during the latter&#x27;s Mercury Atlas 6 orbital mission. Carpenter flew the next mission, Mercury-Atlas 7, in the spacecraft he named &quot;Aurora 7&quot;. Due to a series of malfunctions, the spacecraft landed downrange from its intended splashdown point, but both pilot and spacecraft were retrieved.

In 1964, Carpenter obtained permission from NASA to take a leave of absence to join the U.S. Navy SEALAB project as an aquanaut. During training he suffered injuries that grounded him, making him unavailable for further spaceflights. In 1965, he spent 28 days living on the ocean floor off the coast of California as part of SEALAB II. He returned to NASA as Executive Assistant to the Director of the Manned Spacecraft Center, then joined the Navy&#x27;s Deep Submergence Systems Project in 1967 as Director of Aquanaut Operations for SEALAB III. He retired from NASA in 1967 and from the Navy, with the rank of commander, in 1969.

Carpenter became a consultant to sport and diving manufacturers, and to the film industry on space flight and oceanography. He gave talks, and appeared in television documentaries. He was involved in projects related to biological pest control and waste disposal, and for the production of energy from industrial and agricultural wastes. He appeared in television commercials and wrote a pair of technothrillers and an autobiography, &quot;For Spacious Skies: The Uncommon Journey of a Mercury Astronaut&quot;, co-written with his daughter, Kristen Stoever.

==Early life==
Malcolm Scott Carpenter was born on May 1, 1925, in Boulder, Colorado, the son of Marion Scott Carpenter (1901–1973), a research chemist, and Florence Kelso ( Noxon, known in her family as &quot;Toye&quot;; 1900–1962). Carpenter, known in his childhood as Bud or Buddy, moved with his parents to New York City, where his father had been awarded a postdoctoral research post at Columbia University, in 1925.

In the summer of 1927, Carpenter&#x27;s mother, who was ill with tuberculosis, returned to Boulder, taking him with her. (In those days, mountain air was believed to aid recovery). Her condition deteriorated, and she entered the Mesa Vista Sanatorium in 1930. She recovered sufficiently to become chief medical librarian at Boulder Community Hospital in 1945. Carpenter&#x27;s father remained in New York, but found it hard to find work during the Great Depression. Eventually his father secured a good position at Givaudan. Carpenter&#x27;s parents divorced in 1945, and his father remarried.

Carpenter lived with his maternal grandparents in the family home at the corner of Aurora Avenue and Seventh Street. He later denied naming his spacecraft &quot;Aurora 7&quot; after Aurora Avenue. He was educated at University Hill Elementary School in Boulder, and Boulder High School, where he played the clarinet, was a cheerleader, and served on the editorial board of the student newspaper. He was a Boy Scout, and earned the rank of Second Class Scout.

==Naval service==
Like many people in Boulder, Carpenter was deeply affected by the attack on Pearl Harbor, which brought the United States into World War II, and he resolved to become a naval aviator. On February 12, 1943, he enlisted at the U.S. Navy&#x27;s recruiting office at Lowry Field near Denver. He then traveled to the headquarters of the 12th Naval District in San Francisco, where he was accepted into the Navy&#x27;s V-5 Aviation Cadet Training Program.

The Navy had recruited plenty of potential aviators in the pipeline at this time, so to retain young men like Carpenter in the Navy, the V-12 Navy College Training Program was created, whereby cadets attended college until training positions became available. When Carpenter graduated from high school in 1943, he became a V-12A aviation cadet at Colorado College in Colorado Springs. Three semesters there were followed by six months of preflight training at Saint Mary&#x27;s College of California in Moraga, California, and primary flight training at Ottumwa, Iowa, in a Stearman N2S for four months. The war ended before he finished training, so the Navy released him from active duty in September 1945.

After visiting his father and stepmother in New York, Carpenter returned to Boulder in November 1945 to study aeronautical engineering at the University of Colorado. He was given credit for his previous study, and entered as a junior. While there he joined Delta Tau Delta International Fraternity. He was severely injured in a car accident on September 14, 1946, after he fell asleep at the wheel of his 1934 Ford. The car went over a cliff and overturned. At the end of his senior year, he missed his final examination in heat transfer; a washed-out bridge prevented him from getting to class. This left him one requirement short of a degree.

Carpenter met Rene Louise Price, a fellow student at the University of Colorado, where she studied history and music at the campus bookstore, where she worked part time. She was a member of the Delta Delta Delta sorority. Her parents had also separated when she was young, and her mother too suffered from tuberculosis. They were married at St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Boulder in September 1948.

Plans to retake his heat transfer course were put aside when Carpenter was recruited by the Navy&#x27;s Direct Procurement Program (DPP) as its 500th candidate. Through an oversight, the Navy assumed that he had earned his degree. He reported for duty on October 31, 1949, at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, for pre-flight training. He graduated from pre-flight training on March 6, 1950, and then commenced primary flight training at Naval Air Station Whiting Field, learning to fly in an SNJ trainer. He then went on to Naval Air Station Corpus Christi for advanced training. Most newly-trained naval aviators—including Carpenter—aspired to fly jet fighters, but in view of his responsibilities as a husband and father (his first child was born on January 20, 1950, and Rene was pregnant with a second), he elected the less dangerous option of flying multi-engine patrol aircraft. Rene did not agree with this decision. His advanced training was in the Consolidated PB4Y-2 Privateer, a single-tail version of the Consolidated B-24 Liberator. Rene pinned his aviator wings on him on April 19, 1951, signifying completion of his flight training.
After three months at the Fleet Airborne Electronics Training School in San Diego, California, Carpenter went to a P2V Neptune transitional training unit at Whidbey Island, Washington, after which he was assigned to Patrol Squadron 6 (VP-6), based at Naval Air Station Barbers Point, Hawaii, in November 1951. On his first deployment, Carpenter flew on reconnaissance and anti-submarine warfare missions from Naval Air Station Atsugi in Japan during the Korean War. The missions could be dangerous: on November 6, 1951, one of his squadron&#x27;s aircraft was shot down over the Sea of Japan by two Soviet Lavochkin La-11 fighters, with the loss of all ten crewmen on board.

On his second deployment, forward-based at Naval Air Facility Adak, Alaska, he flew surveillance missions along the Soviet and Chinese coasts. For his third and final deployment, he was based on Guam, flying missions off the coast of China. He was designated as patrol plane commander, the only one in VP-6 with the rank of lieutenant (junior grade)—all the rest held higher rank.

Impressed with his performance, the skipper of VP-6, Commander Guy Howard, recommended Carpenter&#x27;s appointment to the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School. Carpenter was part of Class 13, at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, in 1954. He flew aircraft such as the AD Skyraider and the Martin P4M Mercator. For the first time, he flew jets, including the F9F Panther, F11F Tiger and A3D Skywarrior. He remained at Patuxent River until 1957, working as a test pilot in the Electronics Test Division.

Carpenter attended the Navy General Line School in Monterey, California, in 1957, and then the Naval Air Intelligence School at NAS Anacostia in Washington D.C. In 1958 he was named Air Intelligence Officer of , which was in dry dock at the Bremerton Navy Yard.

==NASA career==
=== Mercury Seven ===
On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite. This shattered Americans&#x27; confidence in their technological superiority, creating a wave of anxiety known as the Sputnik crisis. Among his responses, President Dwight D. Eisenhower launched the Space Race. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was established on October 1, 1958, as a civilian agency to develop space technology. One of its first initiatives was Project Mercury, which aimed to launch a man into Earth orbit, evaluate his capabilities in space, and return him safely to the Earth.

The first astronaut intake was drawn from the ranks of military test pilots. The service records of 508 graduates of test pilot schools were obtained from the Department of Defense. From these, 110 were found that matched the minimum standards: the candidates had to be younger than 40, possess a bachelor&#x27;s degree or equivalent and to be or less. While these were not all strictly enforced, the height requirement was firm, owing to the size of the Project Mercury spacecraft. DPP was restricted to those with bachelor&#x27;s degrees, so it was assumed that Carpenter had one.

The number of candidates was then reduced to 32, which seemed a more than adequate number from which to select 12 astronauts. The degree of interest also indicated that far fewer would drop out during training than anticipated, which would result in training astronauts who would not be required to fly Project Mercury missions. It was therefore decided to halve the number of astronauts.
Then came a grueling series of physical and psychological tests at the Lovelace Clinic and the Wright Aerospace Medical Laboratory. Carpenter had the lowest body fat, scored highest on the treadmill and cycling tests, and was able to hold his breath the longest. This was despite the fact that he had smoked a pack of cigarettes a day since joining the Navy in 1943, and did not quit smoking until 1985.

NASA&#x27;s Charles J. Donlan called Carpenter&#x27;s home on April 3, 1959, to inform him that he had been one of the seven men selected. Rene answered; Carpenter was on &quot;Hornet&quot;, but she could reach him. Carpenter called Donlan from a wharfside pay phone to accept the offer. &quot;Hornet&quot; skipper, Captain Marshall W. White, refused to release Carpenter until the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Arleigh Burke called him.

The identities of the seven were announced at a press conference at Dolley Madison House in Washington, D.C., on April 9, 1959: Carpenter, Gordon Cooper, John Glenn, Gus Grissom, Wally Schirra, Alan Shepard, and Deke Slayton. The magnitude of the challenge ahead of them was made clear a few weeks later, on the night of May 18, 1959, when the seven astronauts gathered at Cape Canaveral to watch their first rocket launch, of an SM-65D Atlas, which was similar to the one that was to carry them into orbit. A few minutes after liftoff, it spectacularly exploded, lighting up the night sky. The astronauts were stunned. Shepard turned to Glenn and said: &quot;Well, I&#x27;m glad they got that out of the way.&quot;

===Mercury-Atlas 7===
====Mission====
Carpenter, along with the other six Mercury astronauts, participated in the development of the Mercury spacecraft. Each had a specialty; Carpenter&#x27;s was the onboard navigational equipment. He served as backup pilot on Mercury-Atlas 6 for Glenn, who flew the first U.S. orbital mission aboard &quot;Friendship 7&quot; in February 1962. Carpenter, serving as capsule communicator on this flight, can be heard saying &quot;Godspeed, John Glenn&quot; on the recording of Glenn&#x27;s liftoff.

The next mission was a second manned orbital flight to be flown by Slayton in a spacecraft he would have named &quot;Delta 7&quot;, but he was suddenly grounded for an atrial fibrillation. Carpenter was assigned to replace him instead of Slayton&#x27;s backup, Schirra, as Carpenter had more training time in the simulators. In contrast to Glenn&#x27;s flight, Mercury-Atlas 7 was planned as a scientific mission rather than an engineering one.

After the most trouble-free countdown of Project Mercury to date, Carpenter flew into space on May 24, 1962, watched by 40 million television viewers. He performed five onboard experiments per the flight plan, and became the first American astronaut to eat solid food in space. He also identified the mysterious &quot;fireflies&quot; observed by Glenn during &quot;Friendship 7&quot; as particles of frozen liquid loosened from the outside of the spacecraft, which he could produce by rapping on the wall near the window. He renamed them &quot;frostflies&quot;.
Unnoticed by ground control or the pilot, an overexpenditure of fuel was caused by an intermittently malfunctioning pitch horizon scanner (PHS). Still, NASA later reported that Carpenter had:
At the retrofire event, the PHS malfunctioned once more, forcing Carpenter to manually control his reentry. This caused him to overshoot the planned splashdown point by . The PHS malfunction yawed the spacecraft 25 degrees to the right, accounting for of overshoot; the delay caused by the automatic sequencer required Carpenter to fire the retrorockets manually. This effort took two pushes of the override button and accounted for another 15 to of overshoot. The thrusters had a set sequence of ignition, and that sequence was delayed by Carpenter manually firing them. This added another , producing a overshoot. The flight lasted 4 hours and 56 minutes, during which &quot;Aurora 7&quot; had attained a maximum altitude of and an orbital velocity of .

====Recovery====

There was a great deal of public concern over whether Carpenter had survived. Broadcasting from a CBS news van in Florida, Walter Cronkite painted a grim picture. Although &quot;Aurora 7&quot;″s Search And Rescue And Homing (SARAH) beacon broadcast its precise location, and the recovery vessels, the aircraft carrier and the destroyer , were on their way, NASA did not pass this information along to the news media. Knowing that the recovery vessels might take some time to get to him, and aware of the danger of &quot;Aurora 7&quot; foundering, as had happened to Grissom&#x27;s &quot;Liberty Bell 7&quot;, Carpenter made his way out through the neck of the spacecraft, something the less agile Glenn had been unable to do. He inflated his life raft, climbed into it, and awaited rescue. The sea around him was stained with green dye released to attract the rescue helicopter.

About 36 minutes after splashdown, Carpenter spotted two aircraft. A P2V Neptune from Patrol Squadron 18 flying out of Naval Air Station Jacksonville was the first to sight and mark Carpenter&#x27;s position. It was followed by a Piper Apache, which circled and photographed. Carpenter then knew he had been located. They were followed by SC-54 Skymaster aircraft, one of which parachuted two frogmen, while another dropped a flotation collar that the frogmen attached to &quot;Aurora 7&quot;. An Air Force SA-16 Albatross arrived to collect them, but NASA Mission Control forbade it for fear that the seaplane might break up, although the crew did not consider the swell dangerous. After three hours, Carpenter was picked up by a HSS-2 Sea King helicopter, which took him to &quot;Intrepid&quot;, while &quot;Aurora 7&quot; was recovered by &quot;John R. Pierce&quot;.

====Postflight====

Postflight analysis described the PHS malfunction as &quot;mission critical&quot; but noted that the pilot &quot;adequately compensated&quot; for &quot;this anomaly ... in subsequent inflight procedures,&quot; confirming that backup systems—human pilots—could succeed when automatic systems fail. Organizational tensions between the astronaut office and the flight controller office and simmering resentment among the latter of the astronauts&#x27; hero status—account for much of the criticism of Carpenter&#x27;s performance during his flight. 

NASA&#x27;s 1989 official history of Project Mercury says that until the third pass over Hawaii, Christopher C. Kraft Jr. (who directed the flight from Cape Canaveral) &quot;considered this mission the most successful to date; everything had gone perfectly except for some overexpenditure of hydrogen peroxide fuel&quot;. However, then problems occurred. Kraft wrote in his 2001 memoir: &quot;He was completely ignoring our request to check his instruments... I swore an oath that Scott Carpenter would never again fly in space.&quot; Kraft went so far as to name the chapter of his memoirs dealing with Carpenter&#x27;s flight &quot;The Man Malfunctioned&quot;. 

Yet fuel consumption and other aspects of the vehicle operation were, during Project Mercury, as much if not more the responsibility of the ground controllers. Gene Kranz, assistant flight director at the time, acknowledged that and placed some of the blame on the shoulders of ground control: &quot;A crewman distracted and behind in the flight plan is a danger to the mission and himself. ... The ground had waited too long in addressing the fuel status and should have been more forceful in getting on with the checklists.&quot;

In a 2001 letter to &quot;The New York Times&quot; in response a review of to Kraft&#x27;s memoir, Capenter wrote:

&quot;One might argue,&quot; wrote Tom Wolfe, &quot;that Carpenter had mishandled the reentry, but to accuse him of &quot;panic&quot; made no sense in light of the telemetered data concerning his heart rate and his respiratory rate.&quot; Schirra would later experience problems with the override button on the subsequent Mercury-Atlas 8 flight.
Some memoirs, such as that of Gene Cernan, revived the controversy over who or what, exactly, was to blame for the overshoot, suggesting, for example, that Carpenter was distracted by the science and engineering experiments dictated by the flight plan and by the well-reported fireflies phenomenon:

==Ocean research==

Carpenter met Jacques Cousteau, who was giving a public lecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1963. When Carpenter expressed interest in underwater research, Cousteau suggested that he might consider the U.S. Navy&#x27;s SEALAB project. Carpenter sought out Captain George F. Bond from SEALAB, and obtained permission from NASA to take a leave of absence to join the project. In July 1964, he went as part of the SEALAB team to Bermuda, where they held training exercises at Plantagenet Bank in of water. While in Bermuda, Carpenter sustained a injury from a motorcycle accident when he crashed into a coral wall, leaving him with a compound fracture in his right arm and damage to his left knee.
In August and September 1965, Carpenter spent 28 days living on the ocean floor in SEALAB II at a depth of about off the coast of California. The depth required a cabin gas mixture of 85% helium, 11% nitrogen and 4% oxygen. He suffered another injury when his right index finger was wounded by the toxic spines of a scorpion fish. SEALAB II coincided with Cooper&#x27;s Gemini 5 mission, and Cooper and Carpenter held the first conversation between a craft in outer space and one on the ocean floor.

Carpenter returned to NASA as Executive Assistant to the Director of the Manned Spacecraft Center. He spent the last part of his NASA career developing underwater training to help astronauts with future spacewalks. He resigned from NASA on 3 August 1967, and joined the Navy&#x27;s Deep Submergence Systems Project based in Bethesda, Maryland, as a Director of Aquanaut Operations for SEALAB III. In the aftermath of aquanaut Berry L. Cannon&#x27;s death while attempting to repair a leak in SEALAB III, he volunteered to dive down to SEALAB and help return it to the surface, but SEALAB was ultimately salvaged in a less hazardous manner.

After failing to regain mobility in his arm that had been damaged in the motorcycle accident despite surgical interventions in 1964 and 1967, and diagnosed with avascular necrosis in the knees from deep-sea diving, Carprenter was ruled ineligible for further spaceflight and deep-sea missions. He retired from the Navy in 1969 with the rank of commander, after which he founded Sea Sciences, Inc., a corporation for developing programs for utilizing ocean resources and improving environmental health.
After retiring from the Navy, Carpenter became a consultant to sport and diving manufacturers, and to the film industry, on space flight and oceanography. He gave talks, and appeared in television documentaries on these subjects. He was involved in projects related to biological pest control and waste disposal, and for the production of energy from industrial and agricultural wastes. Together with the other Mercury Seven astronauts, he established the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation for science and engineering students. 

Carpenter appeared in television commercials for brands such as Oldsmobile, Standard Oil of California, Nintendo, and Atari. He wrote a pair of technothrillers, &quot;The Steel Albatross&quot; (1991) and &quot;Deep Flight&quot; (1994), and in 2003 he published his autobiography, &quot;For Spacious Skies: The Uncommon Journey of a Mercury Astronaut&quot;, which was co-written with his daughter, Kristen Stoever. On Veterans Day in 2008, he joined President George W. Bush and fellow astronaut Buzz Aldrin in a ceremony aboard the &quot;Intrepid Museum&quot;, the ship whose helicopter had recovered him after his &quot;Aurora 7&quot; spaceflight having since become a museum. In 2012, he joined Glenn and former NASA support staff to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Glenn&#x27;s mission.

==Personal life==
Carpenter was married four times, divorced three times, and had a total of eight children by three wives, seven of whom survived to adulthood. He married his first wife, Rene, in September 1948. They had five children: Marc Scott, Kristen Elaine, Candace Noxon, Robyn Jay, and Timothy Kit, who died in infancy. By 1968, Carpenter and his wife had separated, with him living in California and Rene with their children in Washington, D.C. The Carpenters divorced in 1972.

In 1972, Carpenter married his second wife, Maria Roach, the daughter of film producer Hal Roach. Together, they had two children: Matthew Scott, and Nicholas Andre, who would later become a filmmaker. He married his third wife, Barbara Curtin, in 1988. They had a son, Zachary Scott, when Carpenter was in his 60s. The marriage ended in divorce a few years later. In 1999, when he was 74, Carpenter married his fourth wife, Patricia Barrett. They resided in Vail, Colorado.

In September 2013, Carpenter suffered a stroke and was hospitalized in the Swedish Medical Center in Denver. He was then admitted to the Denver Hospice Inpatient Care Center. He died on October 10, 2013, at the age of 88. He was survived by his wife, four sons and two daughters, a granddaughter, and five step-grandchildren.

The Governor of Colorado, John Hickenlooper, ordered flags to be flown at half mast. A public memorial service was held at St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Boulder, which was attended by fellow astronauts John Glenn, Gene Cernan, Charles Duke, Rusty Schweickart, Jack Schmitt, David Scott, Charles Bolden, Dan Brandenstein, Bob Crippen, Bruce McCandless II, Dick Truly and Charles D. Walker. His remains were cremated and the ashes buried on the family&#x27;s ranch near Steamboat Springs, Colorado. 

When asked in 2012 what his legacy would be, Carpenter replied: &quot;I was an astronaut and an aquanaut.&quot;&#x27;

In 1962, Boulder community leaders dedicated Scott Carpenter Park and Pool in honor of native son turned Mercury astronaut. The park features at 25-foot tall climbable metal rocket spaceship. The now-closed Aurora 7 Elementary School, also in Boulder, was named for Carpenter&#x27;s spacecraft. Scott Carpenter Middle School in Westminster, Colorado, was named in his honor, as was M. Scott Carpenter Elementary School in Old Bridge, New Jersey. The Scott Carpenter Space Analog Station was placed on the ocean floor in 1997 and 1998. It was named in honor of his SEALAB work in the 1960s.

Carpenter was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame in 2008, the International Space Hall of Fame in 1981, and the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 2017. Along with the rest of the Mercury Seven astronauts, he was named to the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1990.

==In popular culture==
Speaking from the blockhouse at the launch of &quot;Friendship 7&quot;, Carpenter said &quot;Godspeed, John Glenn,&quot; as Glenn&#x27;s vehicle rose off the launch pad to begin the first U.S. orbital mission on February 20, 1962. This quote was included in the voiceovers of the teaser trailer for the 2009 &quot;Star Trek&quot; film. The audio phrase is also used in Kenny G&#x27;s &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; (The Millennium Mix).

Scott Tracy in the &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; television series was named after Carpenter. In the 1983 film, &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;, Carpenter was played by Charles Frank. Although his appearance was relatively minor, the film played up Carpenter&#x27;s friendship with Glenn, as played by Ed Harris. This film is based on the 1979 book of the same name by Tom Wolfe. In the 2015 ABC TV series &quot;The Astronaut Wives Club&quot;, Carpenter was portrayed by Wilson Bethel, and Rene Carpenter by Yvonne Strahovski. In the 2020 Disney+ miniseries &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;, Carpenter was played by James Lafferty.

<text>The Fuller Brooch is an Anglo-Saxon silver and niello brooch dated to the late 9th century, which is now in the British Museum, where it is normally on display in Room 41. The elegance of the engraved decoration depicting the Five Senses, highlighted by being filled with niello, makes it one of the most highly regarded pieces of Anglo-Saxon art.

==Description==
The brooch is a large disc made of hammered sheet silver inlaid with black niello and with a diameter of . Its centre roundel is decorated with personifications of the five senses. In the centre is Sight with large staring oval eyes, surrounded by the other four senses, each in his own compartment. Taste is in the upper left, Smell is in the upper right, Touch is in the lower right, and Hearing is in the lower left. Taste has a hand in his mouth. Smell&#x27;s hands are behind his back, and he stands between two tall plants. Touch rubs his hands together. Hearing holds his hand to his ear. This is the earliest known representation of the five senses. The outer border consists of 16 small medallions decorated with human, bird, animal and plant motifs.

==Style and materials==
Stylistically it is &quot;in a very late version of the Trewhiddle style&quot;. After the discovery of the Strickland Brooch, one of the closest parallels to the Fuller Brooch, also 9th century and in the British Museum, additional research determined that the niello used in the Fuller Brooch was mainly silver sulphide, a type that went out of use later in the medieval period, in itself an argument against it being a modern forgery. The niello technique may indicate that the brooch was made by metalworkers of King Alfred the Great&#x27;s court.

==History of ownership==
The brooch has survived in excellent condition, although the pin and its attachments have been removed, and the top of the brooch has been perforated for suspension, and it may be the only surviving piece of secular Anglo-Saxon metalwork to remain unburied since its creation. It was thought to be a fake by Sir Charles Hercules Read, Keeper of British and Medieval Antiquities of the British Museum, because of its excellent condition. He advised the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford which had been lent the brooch, to take it off display. It was then bought by Captain A. W. F. Fuller for the price of the silver. In 1952 Capt. Fuller donated the brooch to the British Museum on the condition that it henceforth be called the Fuller Brooch.

<doc id="331383" wikidata="Q4353959" url="?curid=331383" title="Car numberplate game">
<text>A car numberplate game is a car game playable in the United Kingdom and other countries with a suitable car registration scheme, either looking out for a particular number or characteristic of a number plate, or thinking of a word or phrase that corresponds to the letters of the registration. Most are solitary games, however some can be played individually in competition with other passengers.

==In Europe==

One game played in Europe is to spot the 26 letters of the alphabet on passing number plates, starting with A and working forwards. To make this a competitive game between two teams, a second team can work backwards at the same time.

Another game involves spotting number plates with each number from 1 to 999 in order. The letters around the numbers are ignored. This was playable in the UK prior to 2001 when number plates read XXX 111X or X111 XXX, but since the current system of XX11 XXX was introduced in September 2001, such plates have become rarer and this particular game harder to play.

In Bulgaria plates typically have 4 numbers. The goal of the game is to make the first half equal to the second by using various calculations. For example, one scores a point with XX4282XX, as soon as he figures that 4 + 2 = 8 - 2. The letters around the numbers are ignored. 

Another entertaining game is to simply read out the letters phonetically, e.g.: &quot;XHV&quot; becomes &quot;KSZZHVV&quot;, and so on.
In countries where local regions are marked on number plates, such as France or Germany, players can look for cars from different areas. In France, the last two digits of the number plate shows the car&#x27;s department (e.g. 49 is Maine-et-Loire and 16 is Charente.). German plates also indicate where the car is registered (e.g. B is Berlin and KL is Kaiserslautern), however this changed from 2014.

Another game is spotting unusual vanity plates, where the car owner has paid a premium to get a particular code, like &quot;REDBMW&quot;, &quot;HERTOY,&quot; or &quot;BONZO&quot;. In most European countries, premiums for such license plates are very high (sometimes as much as 2,000 euros), so very few drivers own such plates.

Another European version is spotting a plate and taking the letters - in order - and trying to construct a word which contain all the letters in the same order. For example, a Swede might see the plate &quot;SVG111&quot; and construct the Sweden words &quot;sving&quot; (&quot;swing&quot;) or &quot;Sverige&quot; (Sweden). Points can be rewarded in different manners, such as finding the shortest word or finding the longest word.

A similar variant, particularly popular in the United Kingdom, involves considering the last three letters of a number plate to be an acronym, and creating a three-word sentence that fits. For example, a number plate ending in ZKG could be &quot;Zebra Kills Giraffe&quot;. This game is not playable with most European number plates, unless they contain three characters in a row.

==In North America==

A North American version of the game, commonly referred to as the &quot;license plate game,&quot; involves attempting to find a license plate from each Canadian province, U.S. or Mexican state. After one player has spotted a plate especially rare in that region, the other players get a higher number of points by spotting another plate that matches the first. If a player calls out a state that has already been named, or the wrong state, they may have to pay some physical forfeit. (This game can also be played in Ireland, where numberplates indicate the city to which the car is registered.)

Another game common in North America is &quot;license plate poker,&quot; in which the players attempt to form poker hands from the characters on license plates. Since North American plates have shorter texts than those in Europe, this is more difficult than it would seem. Flushes are obviously impossible, and straights are exceedingly rare.

Another game is spotting unusual vanity plates (as in Europe), or spotting a double letter or number (i.e. ABC-113 or ABB-113).

A point-scoring game can be played in the U.S. by assigning each plate a point value based on the last digit on the plate. Letters are assigned points based on their position in the alphabet, e.g., a plate with the letter M for the last digit is worth 13 points. A further variation allows points for plates that end in zero by moving back in the plate until a non-zero digit is found. In this variation the hypothetical plate ABC120 would be worth 20 points. Points are totaled for either the current trip or multiple legs of a trip by agreement.

== Similar games ==

Various car-spotting games exist in which players look out for cars which have rare traits, such as a particular colour or model.

The Canadian gameshow &quot;Bumper Stumpers&quot; ran in the 1980s, and challenged its contestants to solve gramogram letter puzzles presented as vanity licence plates, such as &quot;PYR88&quot; having a solution of &quot;pirates&quot; (&quot;pyr&quot; + &quot;eights&quot;).

<text>Commodore Records was an American independent record label known for producing Dixieland jazz and swing. It is also remembered for releasing Billie Holiday&#x27;s hit &quot;Strange Fruit&quot;.

==History==

Commodore Records was founded in the spring of 1938 by Milt Gabler, a native of Harlem who founded the Commodore Music Shop in 1926 in Manhattan at 136 East 42nd Street (diagonally across the street from the Commodore Hotel), and from 1938–1941 with a branch at 46 West 52nd Street,

Commodore&#x27;s albums included dixieland music (Eddie Condon, Wild Bill Davison) and swing (Coleman Hawkins, Earl Hines). Commodore&#x27;s biggest hit was &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; (backed with &quot;Fine and Mellow&quot;) by Billie Holiday, which reached No. 16 on the charts on July 22, 1939. The label was most active from 1939 to 1946. The roster included Bud Freeman, Bobby Hackett, Edmond Hall, Hot Lips Page, Pee Wee Russell, Willie &quot;The Lion&quot; Smith, Muggsy Spanier, Art Tatum, Fats Waller, Lee Wiley, and Lester Young.

Gabler arranged for recording and pressing to be done by the American Record Corporation (ARC), then Reeves Transcription Services and Decca. In the early 1960s, a series of Commodore albums was compiled by Gabler and released by Mainstream. In the late 1980s, Mosaic issued Commodore&#x27;s complete recordings in three box-sets (LP).

Billy Crystal, Gabler&#x27;s nephew, compiled an album of songs dedicated to his uncle titled &quot;Billy Crystal Presents: The Milt Gabler Story&quot;.

She was an important part of the renaissance in Danish handball during the 1990s. Her temper and impressive skills afforded everybody an opinion and after the first gold medal at the European championship in 1994 the national team affectionately earned the nickname &quot;the iron ladies&quot; and status of national sports heroes.

Although the national handball team of the 1990s had many profiles it is undisputed that Andersen was the most prolific and controversial. Although nobody questioned her skills, her temper, causing numerous expulsions from high-profile matches, was an issue of some debate. During the 1996 Summer Olympics, the Danish coach, Ulrik Wilbek, briefly banned her from the team due to disputes of her playing style and behavior on the floor.

She has played 133 matches for the Danish national handball team for women and has scored 725 goals. This makes her the third most scoring player ever for the Danish national team, behind Camilla Andersen and Janne Kolling, who were part of the same &#x27;iron ladies&#x27; team.

It was also Andersen who introduced handball to true showmanship. Greatly influenced by basketball and notably the Harlem Globetrotters, she invented a playing style aimed at the audience rather than the opposing team. After her retirement as an active player, she organized a &quot;dream team&quot; of the best female handball players in 2000 and 2001 which played a selected Danish team. The &quot;dream team&quot; matches were a success, but they stopped when Andersen could no longer play actively herself.

Because of a heart defect, Andersen stopped her player career in 1999.

==Coaching==
Andersen immediately started coaching the Danish Women&#x27;s Handball League club Slagelse. She first helped the team reach the top league and later win the Champions League three times, in 2003/04, 2004/05 and 2006/07. In 2006, she also coached the national team of Serbia.

In 2008, she left Slagelse for FCK Håndbold. In 2010, she left FCK Håndbold because the club dissolved and decided to take a break before coaching a new team.

In February 2011, Andersen became the new coach of Oltchim Râmnicu Vâlcea. The Romanian club hired her in the attempt of winning the Champions League.

In March 2011, after less than two months of coaching, she was fired because of poor results, losing two matches from a total of four on the bench of Oltchim in the main round of the Champions League.

In 2015 after parting ways with the 1. division club DHG Håndbold, she stated that her managing career was over, and that she &quot;could not imagine getting involved with Handball again&quot;.

<text>Vee-Jay Records is an American record label founded in the 1950s, located in Chicago and specializing in blues, jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll.

The label was founded in Gary, Indiana, in 1953 by Vivian Carter and James C. Bracken, a husband-and-wife team who used their initials for the label&#x27;s name. Vivian&#x27;s brother, Calvin Carter, was the label&#x27;s A&amp;R man. Ewart Abner, formerly of Chance Records, joined the label in 1955, first as manager, then as vice president, and ultimately as president. One of the earliest African American-owned record companies, Vee-Jay quickly became a major R&amp;B label, with the first song recorded, the Spaniels&#x27; &quot;Baby It&#x27;s You,&quot; making it to the top ten on the national R&amp;B charts.

==Artists==
Major acts on Vee-Jay in the 1950s included blues singers Jimmy Reed, Memphis Slim, and John Lee Hooker, and rhythm and blues vocal groups the Spaniels, the Dells, and the El Dorados. The 1960s saw the label become a major soul label with Jerry Butler, Gene Chandler, Dee Clark, and Betty Everett having hit singles on both the pop and R&amp;B charts. Vee-Jay was also the first label to nationally issue a record by the Pips (through a master purchase from the tiny HunTom label of Atlanta), who became Gladys Knight and the Pips in 1962 when they moved to Fury Records.

Vee-Jay had significant success with pop/rock and roll acts, such as the Four Seasons (their first non-black act) and the Beatles. Vee-Jay acquired the rights to some of the early recordings by the Beatles through a licensing deal with EMI Records, since EMI&#x27;s American affiliate Capitol Records initially rejected issuing the Beatles records in America. The main attraction at the time, however, was another EMI performer, Frank Ifield. Calvin Carter later said, &quot;There was a number one record over in England at the time—It was &#x27;I Remember You&#x27; by Frank Ifield. We took the record, and as a throw in, they had a group and asked us if we would take them, too. The group turned out to be the Beatles and we got a five-year contract on the Beatles as a pickup on the Frank Ifield contract.&quot;

In the mid-1960s, Vee-Jay signed the former successful child singer Jimmy Boyd, known for the hit &quot;I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus&quot;; Boyd was then twenty-five years old. The company ventured into folk music with Hoyt Axton and New Wine Singers, and also picked up Little Richard who re-recorded his Specialty hits and recorded (1965) &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know What You&#x27;ve Got (But It&#x27;s Got Me)&quot;, an R&amp;B success, with Don Covay, Bernard Purdie, Ronny Miller, Billy Preston, and Jimi Hendrix (before Hendrix became successful on his own).

Vee-Jay&#x27;s jazz line accounted for a small portion of the company&#x27;s releases, but recorded such artists as Eddie Harris, Wynton Kelly, Lee Morgan, and Wayne Shorter. The A&amp;R for the label&#x27;s jazz releases was Sid McCoy. The company also had a major gospel line, recording such acts as the Staple Singers, The Famous Boyer Brothers, the Argo Singers, Swan Silvertones, the Caravans, Dorothy Love Coates and the Gospel Harmonettes, and Maceo Woods. Vee-Jay even released comedy on LP, with records by Dick Gregory, and &quot;Them Poems&quot;, Mason Williams&#x27; early nightclub act, recorded with a studio audience in 1964.

==Early history==
Calvin Carter set up Vee-Jay&#x27;s first rehearsal space in a garage at 47th Street and King Drive in Chicago in 1953, then discovered and signed Jimmy Reed. Carter also established a regular studio use arrangement with Universal Recording Corporation, one of the largest independent recording studios in the U.S.

==Success==
Vee-Jay&#x27;s biggest successes occurred from 1962 to 1964, with the ascendancy of the Four Seasons and the distribution of early Beatles material (&quot;From Me to You&quot; b/w &quot;Thank You Girl,&quot; &quot;Please Please Me&quot; b/w &quot;From Me to You,&quot; and &quot;Do You Want to Know a Secret&quot; b/w &quot;Thank You Girl&quot; via Vee-Jay; and &quot;Love Me Do&quot; b/w &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot; and &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; b/w &quot;There&#x27;s a Place&quot; via its subsidiary Tollie Records), because EMI&#x27;s autonomous United States company Capitol initially refused to release Beatles records Vee-Jay&#x27;s releases were at first unsuccessful, but quickly became huge hits once the British Invasion took off in early 1964, selling 2.6 million Beatles singles in a single month. Cash flow problems, reportedly caused by Ewart Abner&#x27;s tapping the company treasury to cover personal gambling debts, led to the company&#x27;s active demise; Vee-Jay had been forced to temporarily cease operations in the second half of 1963, leading to royalty disputes with the Four Seasons and EMI. The Four Seasons then left Vee-Jay for Philips Records, and Swan Records purchased the rights to the Beatles&#x27; &quot;She Loves You,&quot; which failed to meet a sales quota to retain the rights to the band. EMI&#x27;s Capitol Records picked up the U.S. rights for both the Beatles and Frank Ifield.

Other Vee-Jay subsidiary labels included Interphon (which yielded the Top 5 hit &quot;Have I the Right?&quot; by another British group, the Honeycombs), and Oldies 45 for reissues along with Tollie and Abner Records, which was an early subsidiary label formed in 1958. Vee-Jay also did distribution for Champion Records (notable for producing the original version of Tainted Love) as well as Rick Hall&#x27;s Fame Records and, for a time, the Memphis label Goldwax Records and Johnny Vincent&#x27;s Ace Records.

Vee-Jay moved back to Chicago in 1965 after a year in Los Angeles. Liens were placed on Vee-Jay assets still in Los Angeles after legal action by Pye Records due to non-payment of royalties.

==As Vee-Jay International==
Vee-Jay Records filed for bankruptcy in August 1966. The assets were subsequently purchased by label executives Betty Chiappetta and Randy Wood (not the Dot Records founder), who changed its name to Vee-Jay International. The Four Seasons&#x27; catalog was not included in the sale, as the band had negotiated a contract clause that would, in the event of bankruptcy, return the catalog to the band, which has retained them ever since. From 1967 to 1972, Vee-Jay was limited to selling some of the inventory on hand when the company went under, and leasing or licensing the Vee Jay masters to Buddah Records, who came out with &quot;The First Generation&quot; series, and Springboard International, who issued dozens of albums featuring Vee Jay material on their subsidiary label, Upfront. In the 1970s, Vee Jay International itself re-released a number of titles on LPs and 8-track tapes.

In 1978, Vee Jay issued a Silver Anniversary catalog to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the label.

==1980s–present==
The label was revived under new management in 1982 as a dance and R&amp;B label, but closed down in 1986.

In the mid-late 1980s, a one-hour independent documentary film titled “Cradle of Rock and Roll&quot; aired on PBS soon after its completion. It covered the history of Vee-Jay and Chess Records in Chicago, which helped to begin a revival of some interest in Vee-Jay&#x27;s history and catalog. In 1986 Motown licensed 26 of Vee Jay&#x27;s soul, blues and R&amp;B hits for a CD compilation, &quot;Hits from the Legendary Vee Jay Records.&quot;

In 1993, the Vee Jay Limited Partnership released a 3-CD boxed set, &quot;The Vee Jay Story (Celebrating 40 Years of Classic Hits),&quot; again drawn from the label&#x27;s R&amp;B, soul, and blues catalog. The package includes a red-vinyl facsimile 45 of the Spaniels&#x27; &quot;Goodnite Sweetheart Goodnite.&quot;

Under the management of Michele Tayler, the company was reactivated in 1998 as The Vee-Jay Limited Partnership. Its main office is located in Redding, Connecticut.

Collectables Records has been remastering and reissuing Vee-Jay albums on audio CD since 2000. A compilation which contains a Best of Vee-Jay box set as well as individual &quot;Best of the Vee-Jay Years&quot; CDs is released by Shout! Factory.

In July 2014 its catalogue was acquired by Concord Music Group. The sale was facilitated by Minneapolis film producer, Scott McLain.

The Vee-Jay Records story is featured on the documentary series &quot;Profiles of African-American Success&quot;.

==Subsidiaries==

Abner Records was a subsidiary of Vee-Jay Records. It was originally named Falcon Records, but the name was changed in 1958 since there already existed a Falcon Records. The label was named after Ewart Abner who was general manager at Vee-Jay, 1955–1961. Falcon Records Scotland (2011–present) is a sub-label of Jilted Generation Inc. Falcon Records launched October 2011 in partnership with &quot;Music Media Management&quot; owned by Diania Elliott Tomlin Perkins &amp; Eric Bryce, &quot;In Hoodz We Trust (IHWT)&quot; owned by Jay Supa &amp; &quot;Make Noise Fife&quot; owned by Alex Herbert. Exodus Records was also a subsidiary of Vee-Jay, focusing largely on gospel music releases (such as early Billy Preston recordings) as well as being the label for some reissues of blues and jazz records.

<text>Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck ( ; April or May, 1562 – 16 October 1621) was a Dutch composer, organist, and pedagogue whose work straddled the end of the Renaissance and beginning of the Baroque eras. He was among the first major keyboard composers of Europe, and his work as a teacher helped establish the north German organ tradition.

==Life==
Sweelinck was born in Deventer, Netherlands, in April or May 1562. He was the eldest son of organist Peter (or Pieter) Swybbertszoon and Elske Jansdochter Sweeling, daughter of a surgeon. Soon after Sweelinck&#x27;s birth, the family moved to Amsterdam, where from about 1564, Pieter Swybbertszoon served as organist of the Oude Kerk (Sweelinck&#x27;s paternal grandfather and uncle also were organists). Jan Pieterszoon must have received first lessons in music from his father. Unfortunately, his father died in 1573. He subsequently received general education under Jacob Buyck, Catholic pastor of the Oude Kerk (these lessons stopped in 1578 after the Reformation of Amsterdam and the subsequent conversion to Calvinism; Buyck chose to leave the city). Little is known about his music education after the death of his father; his music teachers may have included Jan Willemszoon Lossy, a little-known countertenor and shawm player at Haarlem, and/or Cornelis Boskoop, Sweelinck&#x27;s father&#x27;s successor at the Oude Kerk. If Sweelinck indeed studied in Haarlem, he was probably influenced to some degree by the organists of St.-Bavokerk, Claas Albrechtszoon van Wieringen and Floris van Adrichem, both of whom improvised daily in the Bavokerk.

According to Cornelis Plemp, a pupil and friend of Sweelinck&#x27;s, he started his 44-year career as organist of the Oude Kerk in 1577, when he was 15. This date, however, is uncertain, because the church records from 1577 to 1580 are missing and Sweelinck can only be traced in Oude Kerk from 1580 onwards; he occupied the post for the rest of his life. Sweelinck&#x27;s widowed mother died in 1585, and Jan Pieterszoon took responsibility for his younger brother and sister. His salary of 100 florins was doubled the next year, presumably to help matters. In addition, he was offered an additional 100 guilders in the event that he married, which happened in 1590 when he married Claesgen Dircxdochter Puyner from Medemblik. He was also offered the choice between a further 100 guilders and free accommodations in a house belonging to the town, the latter of which he chose. Sweelinck&#x27;s first published works date from around 1592–94: three volumes of chansons, the last of which is the only remaining volume published in 1594 (for reasons that are not certain, the composer adopted his mother&#x27;s last name; &quot;Sweelinck&quot; first appears on the title-page of the 1594 publication). Sweelinck then set to publishing psalm settings, aiming to set the entire Psalter. These works appeared in four large volumes published in 1604, 1613, 1614 and 1621. The last volume was published posthumously and, presumably, in unfinished form. Sweelinck died of unknown causes on 16 October 1621 and was buried in the Oude Kerk. He was survived by his wife and five of their six children; the eldest of them, Dirck Janszoon, succeeded his father as organist of the Oude Kerk.

The composer most probably spent his entire life in Amsterdam, only occasionally visiting other cities in connection with his professional activities: he was asked to inspect organs, give opinions and advice on organ building and restoration, etc. These duties resulted in short visits to Delft, Dordrecht (1614), Enkhuizen, Haarlem (1594), Harderwijk (1608), Middelburg (1603), Nijmegen (1605), Rotterdam (1610), Rhenen (1616), as well as Deventer, his birthplace (1595, 1616). Sweelinck&#x27;s longest voyage was to Antwerp in 1604, when he was commissioned by the Amsterdam authorities to buy a harpsichord for the city. No documentary evidence has turned up to support the tradition, going back to Mattheson, that Sweelinck visited Venice – perhaps a confusion with his brother, the painter Gerrit Pietersz Sweelink, who did – and similarly there is no evidence that he ever crossed the English Channel, although copies of his music did such as the pieces included in the &quot;Fitzwilliam Virginal Book.&quot; His popularity as a composer, performer and teacher increased steadily during his lifetime. Contemporaries nicknamed him &quot;Orpheus of Amsterdam&quot; and even the city authorities frequently brought important visitors to hear Sweelinck&#x27;s improvisations.

==Works==

Sweelinck represents the highest development of the Dutch keyboard school, and indeed represented a pinnacle in keyboard contrapuntal complexity and refinement before J.S. Bach. However, he was a skilled composer for voices as well, and composed more than 250 vocal works (chansons, madrigals, motets and Psalms).

Some of Sweelinck&#x27;s innovations were of profound musical importance, including the fugue—he was the first to write an organ fugue which began simply, with one subject, successively adding texture and complexity until a final climax and resolution. It is also generally thought that many of Sweelinck&#x27;s keyboard works were intended as studies for his pupils. He was also the first to use the pedal as a real fugal part. Stylistically Sweelinck&#x27;s music also brings together the richness, complexity and spatial sense of Andrea and Giovanni Gabrieli, and the ornamentation and intimate forms of the English virginalists. In some of his works Sweelinck appears as a composer of the Baroque style, with the exception of his chansons which mostly resemble the French Renaissance tradition. In formal development, especially in the use of countersubject, stretto, and organ point (pedal point), his music could be said to resemble Bach (who was quite possibly familiar with Sweelinck’s music).

Sweelinck was a master improviser, and acquired the informal title of the &quot;Orpheus of Amsterdam&quot;. More than 70 of his keyboard works have survived, and many of them may be similar to the improvisations that residents of Amsterdam around 1600 were likely to have heard. In the course of his life, Sweelinck was involved with the musical liturgies of three distinctly different traditions: Catholic, the Calvinist, and Lutheran—all of which are reflected in his work. Even his vocal music, which is more conservative than his keyboard writing, shows a striking rhythmic complexity and an unusual richness of contrapuntal devices.

==Influence==

Sweelinck&#x27;s only duties in Amsterdam were those of an organist. Contrary to custom, he did not play the carillon or the harpsichord on formal occasions, nor was he regularly required to produce compositions. Calvinist services did not typically include organ playing due to the belief in what is now called the Regulative Principle. The Regulative Principle restricted the elements of worship to only that which was commanded in the New Testament. However, the Consistory of Dordrecht of 1598 instructed organists to play variations on the new Genevan psalm tunes before and after the service so that the people would become familiar with them. Sweelinck was employed instead by the city itself. As he worked for Protestant magistrates the remainder of his life, it is likely that he was an adherent of Calvinism. In the 1590s three of his children were baptized in the Oude Kerk. His employment allowed him time for teaching, for which he was to become as famous as for his compositions. Sweelinck&#x27;s pupils included the core of what was to become the north German organ school: Jacob Praetorius II, Heinrich Scheidemann, Paul Siefert, Melchior Schildt and Samuel and Gottfried Scheidt. Students of Sweelinck were seen as musicians against whom other organists were measured. Sweelinck was known in Germany as the &quot;maker of organists&quot;. Sociable and respected, he was in great demand as a teacher. His Dutch pupils were undoubtedly many, but none of them became composers of note. Sweelinck, however, influenced the development of the Dutch organ school, as is shown in the work of later composers such as Anthoni van Noordt. Sweelinck, in the course of his career, had set music to Catholic, Calvinist and Lutheran liturgies. He was the most important composer of the musically rich &quot;golden era&quot; of the Netherlands.

Sweelinck&#x27;s influence spread as far as Sweden and England, carried to the former by Andreas Düben and to the latter by English composers such as Peter Philips, who probably met Sweelinck in 1593. Sweelinck, and Dutch composers in general, had evident links to the English school of composition. Sweelinck&#x27;s music appears in the &quot;Fitzwilliam Virginal Book&quot;, which otherwise only contains the work of English composers. He wrote variations on John Dowland&#x27;s famous Lachrimae Pavane. John Bull, who was probably a personal friend, wrote a set of variations on a theme by Sweelinck after the death of the Dutch composer.

<text>Sign cricket (also called pub cricket) is a car game which is played in the United Kingdom and other countries with a sufficient number of suitably named pubs. Players score points by spotting pub signs: the score is equal to the total number of physical legs belonging to the people or animals in the pub&#x27;s name. (For example, the King George would be worth two points.)

==Rules==
There are several variations of the rules. A basic version is described in the 1966 &quot;AA Book of the Road&quot;. Taking it in turns during a journey, one player &quot;bats&quot;. This means he looks for pubs which the car passes. When one is found he gets a &quot;run&quot; (point) for each physical leg possessed by the subject of the title of the pub. Thus &quot;The Jolly Sailor&quot;, a biped, gets 2 points whilst &quot;The White Horse&quot;, a quadruped, gets 4. If a pub&#x27;s name is that of an object or concept with no legs, it scores no points. A player is out if the pub name includes the word &quot;arms&quot; or &quot;head&quot; (e.g. &quot;The King&#x27;s Head&quot;, &quot;The Baker&#x27;s Arms&quot;), and it is the next player&#x27;s turn. The game ends at the end of the journey. The player with the highest score wins.

===Disputes===
Disputes can occur with many pub signs. For example, is &quot;Hogshead&quot; &quot;out&quot; (the head of a hog) or &quot;no points&quot; (the type of barrel known as a hogshead)? Does the &quot;Highwayman&#x27;s Arms&quot; get a player out, treating &quot;arms&quot; as naming the highwayman&#x27;s front limbs, or two points, counting his legs and treating &quot;arms&quot; as referring to his weapons? Is &quot;King Henry&#x27;s Rest&quot; &quot;two points&quot; because of the King or &quot;no points&quot; because the &quot;Rest&quot; is an inanimate object? How many horses are there in &quot;Coach and Horses&quot;? Does the slug in &quot;The Slug and Lettuce&quot; have one leg or no legs?

These disputes can be resolved by mutual agreement as they arise but players may prefer to agree house rules in advance. There are three ways to handle signs with plural nouns such as &quot;The Coach and Horses&quot;: (1) agree that any ill-defined plural noun counts as two of that object (so two horses, for eight points); (2) count the horses on the picture outside the pub (e.g. four horses get 16 points); or (3) agree in advance that ill-defined groups such as &quot;The Coach and Horses&quot; or &quot;The Cavaliers&quot; count a certain number of runs (e.g. six or ten).

===Numberplate cricket===
One variation on this game scores &#x27;runs&#x27; based on car number plates. When the driver gets behind another car, the number plate is examined, and the number plate either scores runs or wickets. The numbers in the plate are added together and multiplied by the number of vowels in the plate. If the answer is 0, then a wicket falls. For example:

*AB02XYZ – numbers added together = 2, × 1 vowel = 2 runs
*A999EOU = 9+9+9 (27) × 4 = 108
*FG04SDF = 4 × 0 = 0 (wicket)

Play continues until the batter loses 10 wickets, then the next player bats.

==High-scoring pubs==
Of commonly occurring pub signs, amongst the best are &quot;The Seven Swans&quot; (14 points) and &quot;Fox and Hounds&quot; (12 points). Some unusual pub names can score far more – &quot;The Twenty Church Wardens&quot;, in Cockley Cley, Norfolk, scores 40 points and &quot;The Million Hare&quot;, in Woolwich, scored 4 million points in the basic version of the game until it was renamed.

&quot;The Cricketers&quot; scores four points (the number of cricketers is unspecified, so assume two) but &quot;The Cricket Team&quot;, if it existed, would score 22 (there are eleven cricketers on a cricket team). &quot;The Eleven Cricketers&quot; at Storrington in Sussex, now closed, did score 22 runs since the number of cricketers was specified.

The &quot;Duke of York&#x27;s Men&quot; can be argued to fetch 20,000 points, by reference to the nursery rhyme, but can also be argued to score only four points as the name does not specify how many men. Similarly, &quot;The Beehive&quot; could be argued to equal 60000 points, as there would be at least 10,000 bees in a beehive; conversely it could be argued to gain twelve points as the number of bees are not specified. It could also be argued that the beehive is the hive itself and therefore scores no points. Finally, it could also simply be used as a convenient way to declare a winner, especially if one was, anyway, having a pub lunch.

==Example game==
Alice and Bob play the game using the basic version and handling plurals using method (1). Alice is &quot;in&quot;.
*&quot;The Fox&quot; – 4 points (4) 
*&quot;Henry IV&quot; – 2 points (6) 
*&quot;The Oak Tree&quot; – 0 points (6) 
*&quot;Coach and Horses&quot; – 8 points, because we assume two horses and no passengers (14) 
*&quot;King&#x27;s Head&quot; – Alice is out with 14 points, Bob is in 
*&quot;The Crown and Anchor&quot; – 0 points (0) 
*&quot;The Red Lion&quot; – 4 points (4) 
*&quot;The Three Horseshoes&quot; – 0 points (4) 
*&quot;The Carpenter&#x27;s Arms&quot; – Bob is out with 4 points, Alice is back in 
*&quot;The Pig and Rooster&quot; – 6 points (20) 
*&quot;The Baker&#x27;s Arms&quot; – Alice is out with 20 points, Bob is back in 
*&quot;The Zebra&quot; – 4 points (8) 
*&quot;The Fox and Hounds&quot; – 12 points, because we assume one fox and two hounds (20) 
*&quot;The Silver Star&quot; – 0 points (20) 
*&quot;The Wrestlers&quot; – 4 points, because we assume two wrestlers (24) 
*&quot;The County Arms&quot; – Bob is out with 4 points, Alice is back in 
*&quot;Sir Isaac Newton&quot; – 2 points (22)

The journey ends. Bob wins with 24 points to Alice&#x27;s 22.

<text>Cirencester Grammar School (CGS) was a grammar school in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, England, founded in about 1461 and closed in 1966.

==History==
The principal founder of the school was John Chadworth (d. 1471), Bishop of Lincoln. He is recorded in Lincoln Cathedral as a &quot;Gloucester Man&quot;. He was educated at Oxford and was afterwards a Fellow and Provost of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

Princess Alexandra of Kent visited the school on 23 July 1958 as part of its quincentenary celebrations.

===Closure===
The school finally closed in July 1966, at the end of the summer term, as part of a reorganisation of county schools. In September 1966 its forms became part of the Cirencester School, combining with pupils from the Deer Park Secondary Modern School, and the new First Form entrants for 1966 went directly to the Deer Park site. Eventually the old Cirencester Grammar School forms all moved there, also.

The School&#x27;s Victoria Road buildings still survive much as they were in 1966. They were taken over by a junior school (previously in Lewis Lane), which was subsequently joined by a primary school. The junior school closed in July 2010

==Notable former pupils==

* Dr Vernon Ellis Cosslett, physicist and former president of the Association of University Teachers and the Royal Microscopical Society
* William Court, Professor of Economic History at the University of Birmingham from 1947 to 1970 and president of the Economic History Society from 1969 to 1970
* James Dallaway (1763–1834), antiquary, topographer and writer.
* Wally Hammond, cricketer whose centenary was celebrated at a reunion in Cirencester in 2003.
* Edward Jenner, who invented inoculation to control infectious diseases.
* Prof Christopher Price, president of the Association for Clinical Biochemistry from 2003 to 2006
* Prof Clement John Tranter CBE, mathematician
* Raymond Fletcher was presented with the OBE by Queen Elizabeth II in 2004 for Services to Disabled People.

==Notable staff==
Sir Peter Maxwell Davies was music master at the school from 1959 to 1962, and it was here that he started his lifelong association with writing works for non-specialist children to perform. He wrote many works for the school&#x27;s orchestra and choir, including &quot;O magnum mysterium&quot;. The school took part in the 1962 Bath Festival, with Yehudi Menuhin playing a composition by Sixth former Stephen Arnold.

==Head masters==
* to 1880: Rev. William Bartram
* to 1945: Mr W. N. Weech
*1945–1949: Captain Peter Gedge
*1949–1954: Douglas Whiting, later head of Cheadle Hulme School and Director of Voluntary Service Overseas

<doc id="331398" wikidata="Q282492" url="?curid=331398" title="Jiva">
<text>Jiva (, IAST: &#x27;), also referred as Jivātman&quot;&#x27;,&quot; is a living being or any entity imbued with a life force in Hinduism and Jainism. The word itself originates from the Sanskrit verb-root &quot;jīv&quot;, which translates as &#x27;to breathe&#x27; or &#x27;to live&#x27;. The &quot;jiva&quot;, as a metaphysical entity, has been described in various scriptures such as the Bhagavad Gita and the Upanishads. Each subschool of Vedanta describes the role of the &quot;jiva&quot; with the other metaphysical entities in varying capacities. The closest translation into English and Abrahamic philosophies would be the &quot;soul.&quot;

== Described in the scriptures ==
A common metaphysical entity discussed in the scriptures (such as the Bhagavad Gita, Upanishad and Vachanamrut) in the seven schools of Vedanta is the &quot;jiva&quot; or &quot;atman&quot;: the soul or self.

=== Bhagavad Gita ===
Chapter 2 of the Bhagavad Gita contains verses describing the &quot;jiva&quot;. For example, the &quot;jiva&quot; is described as eternal and indestructible in chapter 2, verse 20:

=== Upanishads ===
बालाग्रशतभागस्य शतधा कल्पितस्य च । भागो जीवः स विज्ञेयः स चानन्त्याय कल्पते ॥ ९ ॥

:&quot;If the tip of the hair were to be divided in to one hundred parts and each part was divided into 100 more parts, that would be the dimension of the Jiva (soul)&quot;. Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad (5.9)

The Shvetashvatara Upanishad compares the &quot;jiva&quot; and the &quot;Paramatma&quot; to two friendly birds sitting on the same tree:

समाने वृक्षे पुरुषो निमग्नोऽनीशया शोचति मुह्यमानः । जुष्टं यदा पश्यत्यन्यमीशमस्य महिमानमिति वीतशोकः ॥ ७ ॥

:&quot;Two birds sitting in the tree (the body). One bird, the jiva is enjoying the fruits of the tree and the other the Paramatma is watching the jiva.&quot; Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad (4.7)

=== Vachanamrut ===
Swaminarayan has described the nature of the &quot;jiva&quot; in his discourse in Vachanamrut Jetalpur 2:
== Vedanta ==
Vedanta is one of the six schools (&quot;darshanam&quot;) of Hindu philosophy, and it contains subschools that have derived their beliefs from the Upanishads, the Brahma Sutras and the Bhagavad Gita. The aforementioned three scriptures are commonly referred to as the Prasthantrayi.

=== Advaita Darshan ===
The Advaita (non-dualist) Darshan posits the existence of only one entity, Brahman. It considers all distinctions ultimately false since differentiation requires more than one entity. Those distinctions empirically perceived, along with those expounded in the Prasthanatrayi, are accounted for within this school by the recognition of a relative reality (&quot;vyavaharik satta).&quot; One such distinction is that between &quot;jivas&quot;, or souls, and Brahman. Understood through the paradigm of relative reality, &quot;jivas&quot; are cloaked by &quot;maya—avidya&quot;, or ignorance—a state in which they are not able to realize their oneness with Brahman. Within Advaita philosophy, the nature of the Jiva is described using three theories or metaphors: &quot;Pratibimba&quot;-&quot;vāda&quot; (theory of reflection)&quot;, Avaccheda-vāda&quot; (theory of limitation)&quot;, and Ābhāsa-vāda&quot; (theory of appearance). According to &quot;Pratibimba-vāda&quot;, the &quot;jiva&quot; consists of a reflection of the &quot;atman&quot;, and the mirror on which the reflection occurs is ignorance (&quot;avidya&quot;). This metaphor clarifies that the &quot;atman&quot; and &quot;jiva&quot; are not distinct, even though they appear to be so, just as one&#x27;s reflection in the mirror appears to be distinct from oneself but is actually identical with one. &quot;Avaccheda-vāda&quot; denies that consciousness can be reflected, and instead understands the &quot;jiva&quot; as a limitation (&quot;upadhi&quot;) of the &quot;atman&quot;. It is limited and appears to be separated from other selves because of ignorance.

=== Bhedhabheda (Dvaitadvait) Darshan ===
The Bhedhabheda Darshan, founded by Nimbarka, maintains that &quot;jivas&quot; are at once distinct and part of Brahman, a middle ground of sorts between the extremes of Advaita, utter oneness, and Dvaita, utter distinctness. This notion of difference yet non-difference is commonly depicted through an analogy: just as rays originate from the sun but are spatio-temporally distinct from it, so too &quot;jivas&quot; are parts of the whole that is Brahman. Another analogy given is that of sparks emitted from a fire. The sparks, composed of same substance as fire, are non-different (&quot;abheda&quot;) from the fire. They are also different (&quot;bheda&quot;), located in different place from the fire from which they originated. Yet another analogy given is of ocean and its waves, which shows that even though the bhedabheda darshan entails that Brahman has parts and &quot;jivas&quot; are part of Brahman, this does not mean &quot;jivas&quot; lessen its perfection, just as the waves of the ocean do not lessen the amount of water present in the ocean.

=== Dvaita Darshan ===
Founded by Madhva, the Dvaita (dualist) Darshan rejects the Advaita (non-dualist) notion of one ultimate reality. It propounds a duality of five kinds, the most fundamental of which is that between &quot;jivas&quot; and &quot;Ishvara&quot;. A &quot;jiva&quot; is differentiated from God or &quot;Ishvara&quot; due to the &quot;jiva’s&quot; dependence on &quot;Ishvara&quot;; this state is an indication of eternal, ontological distinction. Unique to this school is the idea of a hierarchy of souls, evocative of predestination. Within the system, some souls are inherently and eternally destined for liberation, others for hell and still others for migration through the cycle of birth and death. It is in this cycle where jivas have the opportunity to perform positive or negative deeds (karmas), and make spiritual efforts to break free of it, known as liberation (moksha).

=== Vishishtadvaita Darshan ===
The Vishishtadvaita Darshan, proposed by Ramanuja, maintains an ontological distinction between &quot;jivas&quot; and God. However, unlike in the Dvaita Darshan, the distinction is qualified. The &quot;jiva&quot; still remains dependent on God for its qualities and volition. Ramanuja uses the doctrine of the body and the soul (&quot;sarira&quot; and &quot;sariri&quot;) to explain the relationship between God and the &quot;jivas&quot;. The &quot;jivas&quot; constitutes the body of God, and God is the soul of the &quot;jivas&quot;. Using this doctrine, Ramanuja is able to maintain an ontological distinction between God and the &quot;jivas&quot;, while still demonstrating their qualified non-duality.

Vishishtadvaita holds, like other &quot;darshanas&quot;, that the self is &quot;chetan&quot;, a conscious being that is made up of consciousness. The school offers many rebuttals against the Advaita conception, one of which addresses the way in which Advaita&#x27;s &quot;jiva&quot;, Brahman, may be in a state of ignorance. The Vishishtadvaita Darshan argues that if ignorance is not a quality of Brahman, then the notion of non-duality is contradicted. Ramanuja compares the consciousness of the jiva, as an atman, to the relationship between a lamp and the light it emits:

Unlike other schools, Vishishtadvaita philosophy proposes that moksha (liberation) is not just the end of transmigration, but also a sense of bliss and joy found in the contemplation of God and living a life of devotion, as a result of which God will aid in granting &quot;moksha&quot;.

=== Shuddhadvaita Darshan ===
The Shuddadvaita Darshan, proposed by Vallabhacharya, has a concept of &quot;nitya-sambandha&quot; which means eternal relationship between &quot;jiva&quot; and &quot;Brahman&quot; (Parabrahman). The &quot;jiva&#x27;s&quot; inherent nature is divine, pure, and spiritual. The &quot;jiva&#x27;s&quot; ultimate purpose is to engage in a loving devotion to Krishna (Supreme Brahman), and liberation is attained through divine grace and the acceptance of the &quot;jiva&#x27;s&quot; loving surrender to Krishna. Vallabhacharya uses an analogy between fire and its sparks, where jivas are sparks emerging from God&#x27;s fire, tiny yet sharing the same essence.

=== Acintya Bheda Abheda ===
The Acintya Bheda Abheda, proposed by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, maintains that &quot;jiva&quot; and &quot;Brahman&quot; are same (&quot;abheda&quot;) and different (&quot;bheda&quot;) and the relationship is inconceivable in thought (&quot;acintya&quot;). Jiva Goswami, one of the main scholars in the Caitanya Vaisnava school, offers a definition of the self that shares many characteristics of other schools but is distinctly aligned with the Bhedhabhedha position that the &quot;jiva&quot; is a part of &quot;Brahman:&quot;

The philosophy proposed by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu accepts that the jiva is aware and possesses distinct qualities. It is neither god, human or animal, and is separate from the senses and mind. It is unchanging, possessing consciousness and bliss, and pervades the body. Whilst the body and mind require a jiva to function, the jiva&#x27;s awareness and existence is not dependant on anything. Goswami also describes that &quot;there is a different &quot;self&quot; in each body, each one an inherent part of the Lord&quot;.

=== Akshar-Purushottam Darshan ===
The Akshar-Purushottam Darshan, the teachings of Swaminarayan as interpreted by the BAPS, centers around the existence of five eternal realities, as stated in two of Swaminarayan’s sermons documented in the Vachanamrut, Gadhada 1.7 and Gadhada 3.10:

The &quot;jiva&quot; is defined as a distinct, individual soul, i.e., a finite sentient being. &quot;Jivas&quot; are bound by &quot;maya&quot;, which hides their true self, which is characterized by eternal existence, consciousness and bliss. There are an infinite number of &quot;jivas&quot;. They are extremely subtle, indivisible, unpierceable, ageless and immortal. While residing within the heart, a &quot;jiva&quot; pervades the entire body by its capacity to know (&quot;gnānshakti&quot;), making it animate. It is the form of knowledge (&quot;gnānswarūp&quot;) as well as the knower (&quot;gnātā&quot;). The &quot;jiva&quot; is the performer of virtuous and immoral actions (karmas) and experiences the fruits of these actions. It has been eternally bound by &quot;maya&quot;; as a result, it roams within the cycle of birth and death. Birth is when a &quot;jiva&quot; acquires a new body, and death is when it departs from its body. Just as one abandons one&#x27;s old clothes and wears new ones, the &quot;jiva&quot; renounces its old body and acquires a new one.

== Similarities with other Schools ==

=== Samkhya-Yoga ===
There are important similarities between the jiva and the &quot;puruṣa&quot; of Samkhya-Yoga. The most visible similarity is that both the &quot;jiva&quot; and &quot;puruṣa&quot; are part of a dualism. Just like Samkhya&#x27;s dualism between &quot;puruṣa&quot; and &quot;prakriti&quot;, there is a similar dualism between the &quot;jiva&quot; and &quot;ajiva&quot; in Jainism. Both the &quot;jiva&quot; and &quot;puruṣa&quot; are also said to be numerous. The Samkhyakarika states:

Relatedly, each &quot;jiva&quot; is, just like a &quot;puruṣa&quot; in Samkhya, qualitatively distinct from another &quot;jiva&quot; so that each can be termed their &quot;own self&quot;.

=== Nyaya Darshan ===
The Nyaya school of philosophy also shares similarities to the Vedanta schools, in that there is the belief that the jiva is eternal, experiences the fruits of its good and bad deeds (karma), and undergoes reincarnation. However unlike other schools where the jiva is the source of consciousness, in the Nyaya school, consciousness is an attribute that only occurs when a jiva associates with a mind. Furthermore, Nyaya schools believe liberation to be a complete absence of suffering, rather than a state of bliss and happiness.

<text>United Records was an American record company and label founded in Chicago by Leonard Allen and Lew Simpkins in 1951.

United issued records by such artists as Tab Smith, Jimmy Forrest, Gene Ammons, Memphis Slim, Roosevelt Sykes, the Four Blazes, the Moroccos, Robert Anderson, and the Staple Singers.

In May 1952, United was joined by a sister label, States. United released 116 singles in a series that ran from 101 to 217, skipping 135 and 200. The company also released 2 10-inch LPs, but never got into 12-inch LPs. Tab Smith was United&#x27;s biggest contributor. He laid down 85 tracks, releasing 24 singles (a fifth of the company&#x27;s entire output) and United&#x27;s first LP.

After the company closed in 1957, Savoy bought the masters by Gene Ammons and the Staple Singers. The rest of United&#x27;s output was eventually acquired by Bob Koester of Delmark Records, which has made most of it available through LP and CD reissues.

<doc id="331417" wikidata="Q12428657" url="?curid=331417" title="Jat Airways">
<text>Jat Airways (stylized as JatAirways; ) was the national flag carrier and largest airline of Yugoslavia and later Serbia and Montenegro and finally Serbia. Founded in 1927 as Aeroput, the airline ceased operations during World War II. After resuming flights in 1947, the airline was renamed &quot;Jugoslovenski Aerotransport&quot; (abbreviated &quot;JAT&quot;, ; &quot;Yugoslav Air Transport&quot;) on 1 April 1947. The airline was renamed again on 8 August 2003. Jat Airways and their predecessors were one of the oldest airlines still in operation. Flight operations were based at Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport, and the airline operated scheduled services to 72 international destinations, outside the areas formerly part of Yugoslavia, as well as charters and wet leases. Jat Airways was owned by the government of Serbia and had 1,250 employees.

On 1 August 2013, the Government of Serbia and Etihad Airways entered into an agreement that reorganized the operations of Jat Airways, and renamed it Air Serbia after the transitional period ended. Certain assets, such as the ATR 72 aircraft, would be transitioned to Air Serbia, while other assets (such as the 737-300s) would remain in JAT Airways branding until retired. The change marked the end of 66 years of the JAT brand.

==History==
===Aeroput===




JAT traces its heritage back to 1927 when Aeroput, the first civil airline in Yugoslavia was founded. Their first international flight was in 1929 between Belgrade and Graz. In 1937, the expansion of international routes and an increase in passenger numbers enabled Aeroput to acquire the Lockheed Model 10 Electra. Aeroput continued to operate until the start of World War II. JAT Yugoslav Airlines was launched on 1 April 1947 and replaced Aeroput in 1948. the name was changed to &quot;Jugoslovenski Aerotransport&quot; (abbreviated &quot;JAT&quot;; &quot;Yugoslavian Air Transport&quot;), then to JAT Yugoslav Airlines and finally to Jat Airways on 8 August 2003.

===JAT – Yugoslav Airlines===
In 1946, it was apparent that the Yugoslav Air Force could not be involved in the nation&#x27;s post-war build-up of civil aviation. Consequently, preparations were made for the formation of an air transport company. Three Douglas C-47 Skytrain and three Junkers Ju 52 were converted to carry passengers. The airline was officially renamed to &quot;Jugoslovenski Aerotransport&quot; (&quot;JAT&quot;) on 1 April 1947.

In 1949, Yugoslavia was faced with a dire international position: isolated both by the West and the East. This caused further rationing of fuel, difficulties in procuring spare parts, and the cancellation of all flights to Eastern European destinations. JAT was forced to survive on six domestic lines. When Yugoslavia turned to the West, an agreement was made with Swissair to open the Belgrade-Zürich route, which was inaugurated on 24 August 1949. Company stagnation marked operations in 1949 because the traffic volume was well below fleet potentials and transport needs in the country. However, 1954 was in many ways a turning point. Convair CV-340 and Convair CV-440 Metropolitan aircraft were purchased for short-haul and medium-haul routes, after which the Douglas DC-3 was used only on domestic routes. Multiple international and domestic routes were opened soon after. In 1957, six Ilyushin Il-14M aircraft were purchased. JAT purchased several Douglas DC-6Bs for long-haul routes in 1959.

===Jet age===
In 1963, the first Sud Aviation Caravelle joined the JAT fleet. In 1969, the first McDonnell Douglas DC-9-32 (of 16) arrived, followed by Boeing 707 in 1970, McDonnell Douglas DC-10 in 1971 (of 7), and in 1974 by the first two (of nine) Boeing 727-200s.

===1970s===
Long-haul routes to North America, Australia, and the Far East were flown by Boeing 707s, introduced in 1970.

In 1975, Belgrade was connected with Karachi, Singapore and Sydney. Same year three brand new Boeing 727s were introduced. In 1976 fleet consisted of 4 Boeing 707, 13 McDonnell Douglas DC-9, 3 Boeing 727, 5 Caravelle and one Convair.

In 1976, two more Boeing 727s joined the fleet, for a total of five. The same year, Belgrade was connected with New York City, Malta, Baghdad, Kuwait City and Damascus. All Caravelles were withdrawn from the fleet, while the line to Karachi was terminated. That year JAT had almost three million passengers.

In 1977, new routes to Madrid and Lyon were introduced.

In 1978, a wide-body McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 (which was chosen over the Boeing 747-200) was purchased to succeed the Boeing 707s on longer-haul routes, although the 707s remained in service into the 1980s on ad hoc charters and as scheduled-flight replacement aircraft. The purchase of a DC-10-30 was followed several years later by the purchase of a medium-range aircraft. The same year, a new route to Beijing was added.

In 1979, JAT carried almost 4 million passengers.

===1980s===
In 1980, the route Belgrade–Chicago was established. Two more brand new Boeing 727s were added to the fleet.

In 1981, Cleveland was added as a stopover on route Belgrade–Chicago. The same year the JAT fleet counted 28 planes 2 DC-10, 13 DC-9, 4 Boeing 707 and 9 Boeing 727.

In 1983, Jat introduced new routes to Alger and Thessaloniki and ceasing route to Beijing.

In 1984, the Belgrade–Toronto route was established. Jat was the official carrier and sponsor of the 1984 Winter Olympics.

In 1985, JAT was the first European airline to purchase Boeing 737-300s. During those years, the company carried five million passengers annually and served 80 destinations on five continents (19 domestic, 45 medium-haul and 16 long haul routes). JAT also constructed a large hangar to accommodate wide-body aircraft and a jet-engine test stand at their Belgrade hub. The same year, Bombay and Calcutta were connected with Belgrade.

In 1987, Belgrade was connected with Melbourne, Perth, Montreal, Los Angeles, and Hong Kong. Profit that year was $205 million.

=== 1990s ===
In 1992, the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia broke apart, resulting in the Yugoslav Wars. JAT was forced to stop all domestic services. The United Nations imposed sanctions on 20 May 1992 against Yugoslavia. For the first time since World War II, international transport was forcibly terminated in Yugoslavia. This was preceded by the decisions of Germany and Italy to interrupt any traffic with Yugoslavia: on 21 December 1991 — Germany, the largest market for JAT in Europe, with seven flights daily and 40&amp; million German marks gross annual profit, followed by Italy on 10 January 1992. The United States imposed an embargo on air traffic with Yugoslavia on 2 May 1992: the last JAT flights to the United States were to Chicago and New York. JAT management decided to re-route North American long-range flights to Canada. However, Canada quickly followed and banned all JAT flights entering the country, terminating all JAT operations across the North Atlantic.

During that time, JAT operated only domestic services between Belgrade, Podgorica, Tivat, Niš, Priština and — for a very short time — Užice–Ponikve Airport. In 1994, JAT resumed some of their international services. In 1998, JAT ordered eight Airbus A319s. This was seen as a political stunt by the president, Slobodan Milošević. The original delivery date was June 2000, but this date had been postponed until a total of $23.5 million was paid off to Airbus while JAT was hoping to divert the deal to another airline. Soon after, all flights were canceled as Europe introduced a new ban and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was bombed for 78 days during the Kosovo War.

In April 2000, director general Žika Petrović was gunned down in front of his home in Belgrade.

===2000s===
International sanctions were lifted in 2000, and JAT resumed regular flight services. To celebrate the move that coincided with the country restructuring from FR Yugoslavia to Serbia and Montenegro, JAT Yugoslav Airlines changed their name to Jat Airways on 8 August 2003. In 2004, Belgrade based Intair Link Airlines was merged into Jat, one year after Intair Link had begun service. Jat sold its last DC-10-30 on 24 June 2005 to France-based company TAT Industries. During 2005, the company also phased out all remaining Boeing 727s and DC-9s. The last airworthy DC-9-32 was leased to the United Arab Emirates company Eastern SkyJets.

By then, Jat Airways was not a member of any alliances or partnerships but did code share on some routes with Adria Airways, Aeroflot, Air France, Alitalia, Austrian Airlines, B&amp;H Airlines, KLM, LOT Polish Airlines and TAROM.

Jat Airways introduced their online booking system in September 2006 and electronic tickets in April 2007. Jat Airways celebrated 80 years of service on 17 June 2007. In 2007 and 2008 the airline received an award as one of the five best brands from Serbia. They also received an award for their television advertisements celebrating 80 years of service. On 3 July 2008 the Jat Airways reestablished air links with neighbouring Croatia after a 17-year absence.

In 2012, Jat celebrated their 85th birthday and began refurbishing their cabins in both business and economy class, at the same time introducing a new frequent flyer program.

=== Privatization attempts ===
The government of Serbia made two unsuccessful attempts to privatize Jat Airways, in 2008 and 2011.

On 16 January 2008, the government of Serbia announced it would sell a 51% stake in the airline. The starting price for the airline&#x27;s 51% share was €51 million, decreased from the earlier announced €150 million in order to increase interest. The tender was canceled after no company had submitted an offer following the deadline.

In 2011, the Serbian government announced that it would create a successor to Jat Airways with a strategic partner. The new airline would assume all of Jat&#x27;s healthy assets, codeshare agreements, aircraft and airport slots. Baltic Aviation Systems was the only company to purchase the tender documentation but decided not to pursue the partnership further. The tender was again canceled due to a lack of interested buyers.

===Strategic partnership with Etihad Airways===
In March 2013, Serbia&#x27;s Minister of Finance Mlađan Dinkić traveled to Abu Dhabi to propose that Etihad Airways take a stake in Jat in order to renew their fleet. In April it was confirmed that Etihad added Belgrade to their summer timetable as a part of the initiative to become a co-owner of Jat alongside the Serbian government. A purchase of a 49% stake in Jat by Etihad is widely suggested by observing media, which is dependent on whether a memorandum of understanding (MoU) is signed with the government of Serbia, possibly in May 2013. On 17 June 2013, an MoU was signed with Etihad and the Serbian government on exploring the possibility of an equity investment in Jat Airways.

On 1 August 2013, the Serbian Government and Etihad Airways formalised an agreement which will see a reorganisation and rebranding of the airline&#x27;s operations to Air Serbia, an entity in which the Serbian Government will have a 51% stake and Etihad Airways will own 49%. Etihad Airways was also granted management rights over the carrier for an initial five-year period.

By then, Serbia had only one airline carrier, Jat Airways shareholding, a company with its own statute, Board of Directors and management bodies. Air Serbia is the result of a strategic partnership agreement between the Etihad Airways and Jat Airways, making the company to fulfill regulatory requirements, and got registered with the Business Registers Agency (APR). Subsequently, Jat Airways changed its name to Air Serbia and everything else was kept unchanged, continuing to be a joint stock company, the commercial entity registered in the APR, and with all the rights and obligations of Jat Airways. At that moment, Jat Airways was working at full power and fulfilling the obligations of regular and chartered passenger transportation, as agreed in its business plan for 2013.

==Liveries==

===Yugoslav Airlines===
When the name Yugoslav Airlines first appeared on aircraft in 1950, the airline had a simple, mainly white livery. During these years there was a Yugoslav flag on the tail, and on the body the words &quot;Jugoslovenski Aerotransport&quot;. Shortly afterwards the airline changed its livery and added a logo on the tail section with a red shaped egg on the tail in which JAT was written in white, a logo kept for the rest of the SFR Yugoslavia period. The rest of the tail was blue, with Yugoslav Airlines written on the fuselage in red. There were variations of this livery during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. The biggest change in this period was when the first Boeing 737-300 aircraft arrived with a silver body, and were kept as such, with just logo and basic livery added.

===JAT Yugoslav Airlines===

With the reintroduction of international flights in 1994 after two years of economic sanctions, JAT introduced a new livery and corporate image. A &quot;euro-white&quot; livery was adopted and the centre-piece was a new tail logo which contained a stylized Yugoslav flag with the white colour being represented by a pair of white wings, the larger wing symbolizing Serbia and the smaller Montenegro. For the first time, the word JAT was written on the aircraft in small blue letters. The words &quot;Jugoslovenski Aerotransport&quot; were painted on the starboard side and Yugoslav Airlines on the port side and these were written in silver italic script. In 1996, the livery was slightly modified, with JAT being painted in billboard size at the front with a small Yugoslav flag in the &quot;A&quot; in JAT. During this time, as a result of the extensive leasing of aircraft by JAT, most aircraft lost the tail logo completely. The livery was updated again in 2001 with the flag in the billboard titles disappearing, and the words Yugoslav Airlines and &quot;Jugoslovenski Aerotransport&quot; being painted in blue using the same font as the main logo. Not all of the aircraft received this update as the livery was updated again with the introduction of the new name &quot;Jat Airways&quot;.

===Jat Airways===
On 20 March 2003, the airline changed its name to Jat Airways. A national competition was held to design the new logo and livery. The winning design had three dots on the tail: blue, red and blue. The fuselage of the aircraft had a large Jat Airways title, with Jat in red and Airways in blue. The new logo was the name Jat Airways written with three dots in blue, red and blue following it. Jat Airways painted only one aircraft in these colours, a Boeing 737-300.

Jat started painting its aircraft all white and in 2006, most aircraft were white with a small Jat Airways logo. In December 2006 the airline decided to return to its dot livery. By August 2007, all aircraft had been painted. The livery is slightly different from the previous dot livery. It has the dots on the tail, but the small Jat titles remain rather than the big Jat Airways logo across the fuselage.

===Historical fleet===


Over the years, Jat Airways (JAT Yugoslav Airlines) has operated the following aircraft types:

==Miscellaneous==

The Aeroput MMS-3 (reg. as YU-SAR) became the first passenger aircraft designed and made in Serbia in 1934 under Aeroput&#x27;s brand name. Also Aeroput ordered two Spartan Cruiser II aircraft and a licence to build further aircraft of the same type. In 1935 one Cruiser II (reg. as YU-SAP) was built under Spartan&#x27;s licence for Aeroput by Zmaj aircraft company in Zemun.

In 1953, JAT began organizing their flights with the introduction of flight codes. The first code, JU720 was used on the Belgrade - Zagreb - Ljubljana route, while the return flight took the code JU721.

Towards the end of August 1959, JAT transported its millionth passenger since the founding of the company back in 1927.

Former JAT flight attendant, Vesna Vulović, holds the world record in surviving the highest free fall with no parachute, when she fell from after the aircraft she was on, was destroyed by a bomb.

A JAT Boeing 707-321 (YU-AGA) flew around the world. Commencing on 10 November 1974, the flight took 19 days to complete, flying: Belgrade - Beirut - Bombay - Singapore - Tokyo - Honolulu - Los Angeles - New York - London - Belgrade.

On 13 February 1978, Marija Todev gave birth in a Boeing 707 (YU-AGI) at Jat flight Belgrade - Sydney. The boy was named &quot;Jatko&quot;.

In 1978, a wide body McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 (which was chosen over the Boeing 747-200) was purchased to succeed the Boeing 707s on the longer-haul routes, although the 707s stayed in service into the 1980s on ad hoc charters and as scheduled-flight replacement aircraft.

On 16 February 1979, the first-ever picture auction in world aviation history is held in JAT DC-10 (YU-AMA) on a scheduled Belgrade - Zagreb - New York flight.

Jat Airways was the first operator of the Boeing 737-300 aircraft in Europe. It arrived at the Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport on 8 August 1985 as YU-AND. This aircraft was withdrawn from service in February 2020 and is awaiting to be preserved.

Jat Airways was to become the first operator of the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 aircraft. However, due to the break-up of Yugoslavia and the imposition of sanctions on Serbia, the aircraft were never delivered.

In 1985, a JAT Yugoslav Airlines flight picked up Abu Abbas in Rome, Italy as he sought political asylum in Yugoslavia after U.S. authorities requested his arrest.

In 2002, the company utilized its fleet for UN missions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the Second Congo War.

JAT began its anti-smoking campaign with ban smoking on its domestic flights in 1987. From 5 April 2002 is prohibited smoking on all Jat flights.

In 2004, Jat Airways was named one of the safest airlines in Europe by the IATA. Jat Airways pilots are considered among the best trained pilots in the world.

The body of former president Slobodan Milošević was transported to Serbia for burial on a Jat Airways regular commercial flight from Amsterdam on 15 March 2006.

Since 1994, Jat Airways has used the following slogans: In safe hands (&quot;U sigurnim rukama&quot;) , The best fly with Jat (&quot;Najbolji lete „Jatom“&quot;) and More than Flying (&quot;Više od letenja&quot;) 

On 19 January 2008, in Jat&#x27;s Boeing 737-300 plane on the regular line Belgrade - Stockholm, at an altitude of 10,000 meters married Birgitta Berglund from Sweden and Predrag Marković from Serbia. The newlyweds with champagne, St. George&#x27;s poem (Djurdjevdan), a cake, applause and congratulations of 117 passengers on the flight JU374, fateful said &quot;yes&quot; in the presence of the godfathers Lela Ristić from Jat Media Center and Vesna Jovanović, stewardess – purser.

<text>Johann Ludwig Bach ( – 1 May 1731) was a German composer and violinist.

He was born in Thal (Ruhla) near Eisenach. At the age of 22 he moved to Meiningen eventually being appointed cantor there, and later Kapellmeister. He wrote a large amount of music and regularly oversaw performances, both at Meiningen and neighbouring courts.

He was a third cousin of Johann Sebastian Bach, who made copies of several of his cantatas and performed them at Leipzig. The cantata &quot;Denn du wirst meine Seele nicht in der Hölle lassen&quot;, BWV 15, once thought to be by Johann Sebastian, and listed as BWV 15 in Wolfgang Schmieder&#x27;s catalogue of his works, is now thought to be by Johann Ludwig.

Bach died in Meiningen.

==Works, editions and recordings==

The earliest lists of compositions by Johann Ludwig Bach appeared in the 19th century: Johann Theodor Mosewius listed 16 of his cantatas in 1852, and Alfred Dörffel listed 17 cantatas and the Mass in E minor, with their incipits, in Vol. 41 of the Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe (1894).

#Kyrie–Gloria Mass in E minor, Missa super cantilena &quot;Allein Gott in der Höh sei Ehr&quot;, a.k.a. BWV Anh. 166, formerly attributed to Johann Nicolaus Bach. Short addition by J. S. Bach in his Leipzig copy of this composition. The text of the Gloria is partly in German: it intersperses the Latin text of the Gloria with, as cantus firmus, all four stanzas of &quot;Allein Gott in der Höh sei Ehr&quot; (which is itself a paraphrase of the Gloria), a Lutheran hymn by Nicolaus Decius and Joachim Slüter. Movements:
#: Kyrie:
#:: &quot;Kyrie eleison&quot; – &quot;Christe eleison&quot; – &quot;Kyrie eleison&quot;
#: Gloria:
#:: &quot;Gloria in excelsis&quot; – &quot;Laudamus te&quot; – &quot;Domine Fili unigenite&quot; – &quot;Quoniam tu solus sanctus&quot; – &quot;Cum Sancto Spiritu&quot;
#Concerto for two violins and orchestra in D major.

Further there is a sacred cantata for the second Sunday after Trinity, &quot;Kommet, es ist alles bereit&quot;, JLB deest, with a manuscript dated 1719.

Compositions that are sometimes attributed to Johann Ludwig Bach:
* BWV Anh. 25 – Kyrie–Gloria Mass in C major, copied &amp; performed by J. S. Bach 1740–1742.
* BWV Anh. 167 – Kyrie–Gloria Mass for double choir in G major, according to 21st-century scholarship attributable to Christoph Bernhard, Johann Philipp Krieger or David Pohle. Older scholarship attributed the mass to Antonio Lotti or Johann Ludwig Bach, after it had been considered Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s up to the middle of the 19th century.

===Score publications===
In 1852 &quot;Denn du wirst meine Seele nicht in der Hölle lassen&quot;, JLB 21, was published as J. S. Bach&#x27;s 15th cantata by the Bach-Gesellschaft.

<text>Afro-dite is a Swedish pop group made up of three pop singers. The group consists of Blossom Tainton-Lindquist, Gladys del Pilar, and Kayo Shekoni. The name is a play on words implying they are beautiful as Greek goddess Aphrodite and black.

*Blossom has already been in showbusiness for a long time. She sings and dances, played in several musicals and even hosted TV-shows on Swedish television.
*Gladys, born in Ecuador, came to Sweden when she was only 7 years old. She worked with Dr. Alban and Denniz Pop but her final breakthrough was when she appeared in &quot;ABBA - the true story&quot;.
*Kayo is another multitalented woman. She is not only a singer, but also an actress, TV-show host and model. In the eighties she sang with the pop group Freestyle and in the nineties she fronted the Eurodance project Le Click.

Afro-dite came together to sing the song &quot;Never Let It Go&quot; for the Eurovision Song Contest 2002. The song was originally meant to be sung by Alcazar but they refused. In Eurovision, Afro-dite reached 8th place. In 2007 they released a new album.

In 2012, they made another attempt for Eurovision with the song, &quot;The Boy Can Dance&quot;, but were eliminated in the first semi-final of Melodifestivalen.

<text>Melodifestivalen (; ) is an annual song competition organised by Swedish public broadcasters Sveriges Television (SVT) and Sveriges Radio (SR). It determines the country&#x27;s representative for the Eurovision Song Contest, and has been staged almost every year since 1959. In the early 2000s, the competition was the most popular television program in Sweden; it is also broadcast on radio and the Internet. In 2012, the heats averaged 3.3 million viewers, and over an estimated four million people in Sweden watched the final, almost half of the Swedish population.

The festival has produced seven Eurovision winners and 26 top-five placings for . The winner of Melodifestivalen has been chosen by panels of jurors since its inception. Since 1999, the juries have been joined by a public telephone vote which has an equal influence over the outcome. The competition makes a considerable impact on the music charts in Sweden.

The introduction of heats in 2002 raised the potential number of contestants from around twelve to thirty-two. A children&#x27;s version of the competition, , also began that year. Light orchestrated pop songs, known locally as schlager music, used to be so prevalent that the festival was sometimes referred to as (&quot;the schlager festival&quot;) or (&quot;schlager Swedish championship&quot;) by the Swedish media. However, other styles of music, such as rap, reggae, and glam rock, have made an appearance since the event&#x27;s expansion. The introduction of a final in Stockholm has attracted substantial tourism to the city.

== Origins ==

With seven nations competing, the first Eurovision Song Contest took place in Lugano, Switzerland in May 1956. Sweden&#x27;s first contest was the third edition of the song competition, in 1958. Without broadcasting a public selection, Sveriges Radio (SR) chose to send Alice Babs to the contest in Hilversum, Netherlands. The song selected was &quot; (), later renamed &quot; (). It finished fourth at Eurovision on 12 March 1958.

The first Melodifestivalen, incorporated into the radio series, took place on 29 January 1959 at Cirkus in Stockholm; eight songs participated. Four &quot;expert&quot; juries in Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malmö, and Luleå decided the winner. The competition was won by Siw Malmkvist performing &quot;Augustin&quot;, but SR decided that the winning song—regardless of its original performer—would be performed by Brita Borg at Eurovision. This policy of selecting the artist for Eurovision internally and having other artists perform potential Swedish entries at Melodifestivalen was stopped in 1961. The competition became a standalone television programme in 1960, known as the . In the event&#x27;s early years, it was also broadcast in Norway and Denmark via the Nordvision network. The competition adopted its current name, &quot;&quot;, in 1967.

Melodifestivalen has failed to be staged on three occasions. In 1964, the competition was cancelled due to an artist&#x27;s strike; Sweden did not send a song to Eurovision that year. Sweden was absent at Eurovision for a second time in 1970 because of a Nordic boycott of the voting system, which had led to a four-way tie for first place at the 1969 contest. After SR staged the 1975 contest in Stockholm, left-wing groups argued that Sweden should not spend money to win and host Eurovision again. This led to mass demonstrations against commercial music and the organisation of an anti-commercial . Therefore, Sweden decided not to send a song to Eurovision 1976 but returned in 1977.

== Participation ==
Hundreds of songs and performers have entered Melodifestivalen since its debut. Although songwriters living outside Sweden were once not allowed to enter Melodifestivalen, the 2012 contest marked the first time foreign songwriters could submit entries, provided that they collaborated with a Swedish songwriter. To be eligible, songwriters and performers must be at least sixteen years of age on the day of the first Eurovision semi-final.

Until 2001, participation in the festival was limited to a single night. The number of contestants ranged from five to twelve. A two-round system was used intermittently between 1981 and 1998, in which all but five of the contestants were eliminated in the first round of voting. Failure to reach the second round under this system was seen as a major failure for a prominent artist; when Elisabeth Andreassen failed to qualify in 1984, it almost ended her music career. The introduction of weekly heats in 2002 increased the number of contestants to thirty-two. At least ten of the contestants must perform in Swedish. A CD of each year&#x27;s competing songs has been released since 2001, and a DVD of the heats and final since 2003. Due to the proliferation of digital download and streaming into the 2010s, DVDs have not been issued for Melodifestivalen in recent years.

Melodifestivalen has been the launch-pad for the success of popular local acts, such as ABBA, Tommy Körberg, and Lisa Nilsson. The competition has played host to performers from outside Sweden, including Baccara, Alannah Myles, Katrina Leskanich, Cornelis Vreeswijk, and Margaret. Melodifestivalen participants have also represented—and unsuccessfully tried to represent—other countries at Eurovision. While local success for Melodifestivalen winners is common, most contestants return to obscurity and few have major international success. The impact that the competition makes on the Swedish charts means an artist need not win the competition to earn significant domestic record sales. For example, the song which finished last at Melodifestivalen 1990, &quot;&quot; by Loa Falkman, topped Sverigetopplistan, the Swedish singles chart. The most recent occurrence was 2024 with Fröken Snusk&#x27;s song &quot;Unga &amp; fria&quot;. In 2007, twenty-one participants reached the Sverigetopplistan. The week after the 2008 final, songs from the festival made up the entire top fifteen on the domestic singles chart.

== Selection of contestants ==
The process of narrowing thousands of potential entries down to the competing songs lasts over seven months. SVT directly selects half of the entries from amongst public submissions, while the other half comes from special invitations made by SVT or other entries that SVT has selected from amongst the submissions. Between 2012 and 2021, the final entry was selected via the competition organised by Sveriges Radio P4. At least 10% of the competing songs are sung in Swedish. The entire process can begin as early as May of the previous year and is completed by January.

=== Songs===

SVT begins looking for songs nine months before the start of the televised Melodifestivalen (within days of the previous year&#x27;s Eurovision final). The deadline for submission is in September and songs can be in any language. In the pre-selection, song length is limited to three minutes and twenty seconds; songs must be shortened to three minutes if they reach the final twenty-eight and qualifying songs may also be remixed.

The submission process is overseen by members of the Swedish Music Publishers Association (SMFF), whose task is to reduce the number of songs, which have numbered over 3,000 a year since 2002, to around 1,200. The 3,440 entries received in the preselection for Melodifestivalen 2009 was the most in the competition&#x27;s history. The figure has since lowered to around 2,500 submissions every year. The SMFF&#x27;s choices are then given to a sixteen-person jury of music professionals, SVT staff and other members of the public. The jury ranges from teenagers to people in their fifties. The songs that qualify, along with their composers and lyricists, are announced at the end of September. This is often followed by fervent speculation over who will perform the songs. Songwriters that qualify must provide interviews to SVT, attend a press conference before the competition, and remain open to promotional appearances if their song reaches the final.

=== Artists and wildcards ===
SVT selects performers for the entries. Artists who perform the demo of a song automatically enter the competition; they must perform their songs if suitable alternate performers cannot be found. The artists&#x27; songs risk disqualification if they refuse. In the past, this rule led to the disqualification of, among others, Carola&#x27;s &quot;&quot; in 2003 and Stephen Simmonds&#x27; &quot;So Good&quot; in 2006. SVT may also give songs to other performers without considering the interests of the demo artist. This prevented the Brandsta City Släckers (in 2004) and Pernilla Wahlgren (in 2005) from performing the songs they had submitted. Replacements for disqualified songs fare unpredictably at the competition. In 2006, &quot;Naughty Boy&quot; by Hannah Graaf (the replacement for Simmonds&#x27; song) finished second to last in its heat. In 2002 and 2007, by contrast, the replacements performed by Jan Johansen and Måns Zelmerlöw reached the final ten. The contestants that will perform the twenty-eight qualifiers from the preselection are announced in late November. Singer-songwriters are common. As such, artists often confirm that they will participate before the official announcement.

The wildcard (&quot;joker&quot;) system was introduced in 2004 to diversify the music featured. Four artists, one in each heat, were invited by SVT to enter a song of their choice into the competition, provided it does not breach the rules. The wildcard songs and artists were announced in January. Since the wildcards&#x27; introduction, three have won the competition. The wildcard system was discontinued in 2013.

The venues for each year&#x27;s Melodifestivalen are announced in September of the preceding year. The heats are held in towns and cities throughout Sweden. The 16,300-capacity Globe Arena (now Avicii Arena) in Stockholm hosted the final since the heats were introduced in 2002, through to 2012. In 2013, the final was moved to the newly-built Friends Arena in Solna Municipality, Stockholm County. The Scandinavium in Gothenburg was offered to host the 2005 final, but ultimately declined due to a scheduling conflict with a Frölunda HC ice hockey match.

The event spent its early years at one venue: Cirkus in Stockholm, which hosted the first ten competitions. It has hosted the Melodifestivalen final 17 times in total. The Avicii Arena has hosted seven finals, and SVT&#x27;s Stockholm headquarters has staged five. The competition first took place outside Stockholm in 1975 as part of a decentralisation policy at SR. Stockholm has hosted 37 finals in total, including the first 14. Gothenburg has hosted eight, and Malmö seven. The competition&#x27;s final has never been held outside these cities. Before the 2002 expansion, the host of the previous year&#x27;s Melodifestivalen would host the Eurovision Song Contest in the event of a Swedish victory. As such, Eurovision 1985, Eurovision 1992 and Eurovision 2000 were held in Gothenburg, Malmö and Stockholm, respectively. Since 2002, the only venues that have hosted more than three heats are Gothenburg&#x27;s Scandinavium, which has hosted one every year since 2003, and Malmö&#x27;s Malmö Arena. In 2008, the Second Chance round was held in Kiruna, which lies north of the Arctic Circle. Since 2013, the final has been held at the Friends Arena. In 2021, all shows of that year&#x27;s Melodifestivalen took place in the Annexet in Stockholm, and without an audience present, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic continued to affect the organisation of Melodifestivalen in 2022, with the first three heats of that year&#x27;s competition all held at the Avicii Arena, and the remaining shows at the Friends Arena.

== Televised rounds ==
The Melodifestivalen takes place over six Saturdays and consists of six live shows: four heats, in each of which seven songs compete; a Second Chance () round featuring songs which missed out on direct qualification from the heats; and a final. Ten songs comprise the final: two direct qualifiers from each of the heats, and the two best-ranked songs in the Second Chance round. Since 2015, there are seven songs for each heat, and twelve (eight direct qualifiers and four from the Second Chance round) in the final. From 2024, five heats are held in each of which six songs compete and two directly qualify, and a run-off vote was held at the end of the fifth heat to determine two songs which missed out on direct qualification from the heats progressing, leading to a twelve-song final.

=== Heats and Second Chance ===
Prior to the introduction of the current format of heats () in 2002, the competition was usually a single live show. Under the current system, four heats (five starting in 2024) are broadcast at 20:00 CET on consecutive Saturday nights. The heats begin in early February, and seven songs (six starting in 2024) compete in each show.

Unlike in the final, no juries are used; televoting decides the results. The songs are performed live with telephone lines open for the first round of voting; two songs with the fewest votes do not qualify to the second round. The top five battle for a place in the final and Second Chance round – with the first and second-placed songs directly qualifying for the final (known in Swedish as ), and the third and fourth-placed songs progressing to the Second Chance round.
Both finalists reprise their entries at the end of the broadcast. The organisation of a heat system for Melodifestivalen popularised televised heats at other Eurovision national selections. A similar system was adopted by the Eurovision Song Contest itself in 2004, which features a semi-final (later expanded to two in 2008) and a final, and remains in place to the present day.

The Second Chance round () is the fifth heat in which the remaining four entries to the final are chosen. The third- and fourth-placed songs from each heat (eight songs in total) compete in the event. The first Second Chance round in 2002 had a panel of former winners decide the two finalists. Between 2003 and 2006, the heat performances were re-broadcast, and a round of voting narrowed the songs to three or four. Another round then determined the two finalists. The programme was broadcast on the Sunday afternoon after the fourth heat. It was held in a smaller venue than those that would have hosted the heats—such as Berns Salonger in Stockholm, which hosted the Second Chance round in 2005.

In 2007, the Second Chance round became a full heat, taking place in a venue comparable in size to those hosting the others. The expanded Second Chance takes place on a Saturday night, adding an extra week to the event&#x27;s timetable. The format of voting also changed with the introduction of a knock-out system. The system pairs the eight songs off against each other, then narrows them down to four before pairing them off again. The winners of the two-second round pairings go through to the final. The two finalists do not reprise their songs at the end of the programme.

In 2015, the system was changed again. The eight songs are divided into four duels, with one song from each duel qualifying into the final, bringing the number of finalists to 12.

In 2022, several changes were made to the overall format. The Second Chance round was reformatted into a semi-final (), where the eight songs are placed into two groups, with the top two from each group proceeding to the final. In 2023, the format of the semi-final was changed, with the top four of the eight songs all proceeding to the final, similar to the preceding heats.

In 2024, the semi-final is scrapped as a separate show. Instead, the third and fourth-placed songs from each heat are placed into a final qualification round at the end of the newly-added fifth heat, with the top two songs proceeding to the final.

=== Final ===
The final takes place at 20:00 CET on a Saturday in early or mid-March. Twelve songs (eleven songs in 2009, ten songs before 2015) participate, two from each heat, four from the Second Chance round, and, only in 2009, the international jury&#x27;s choice. A running order is decided by the competition&#x27;s supervisors the week before to ensure that similar songs and artists are kept apart in the final. Dress rehearsals for the final are held on the prior Friday, and tickets sell out almost as quickly as those for the final itself. The final attracts substantial tourism to its host city Stockholm; a survey in 2006 showed that 54% of spectators had travelled from outside the city. Of these, 6% had come from outside Sweden.

As in the Eurovision Song Contest (and due to the final usually also being broadcast in other Nordic countries via the Eurovision network), a broadcast of the EBU logo introduces and closes the television coverage, accompanied by the prelude to Marc-Antoine Charpentier&#x27;s setting of &quot;Te Deum&quot;. Video &quot;postcards&quot; introduce the entries. The final includes interval performances, which are performed while the juries deliberate and before the televote closes. Former Melodifestivalen contestants have performed as interval acts in the past, including Lena Philipsson in 2005 and the multi-artist medley of former entries in 2000.

The winner receives a trophy, (), from the previous year&#x27;s winner. The trophy, designed by Ernst Billgren, was unveiled in 2005 and awarded to all previous Melodifestivalen winners at the gala in March of that year. The winner of the competition reprises their song at the end of the event.

== Voting ==
Before the introduction of the current voting system in 1999, a group of regional or age-based juries decided the winner of Melodifestivalen. In 1993, televoting was used experimentally but proved unsuccessful. The Swedish telephone network collapsed due to the number of calls, and claims by the Swedish tabloid press suggested the use of televoting had drastically altered the results. Evening newspapers released what they claimed to be the back-up juries&#x27; votes, which showed that the winner, Arvingarna&#x27;s &quot;Eloise&quot;, would have finished fourth had the juries&#x27; votes counted. SVT never confirmed the accuracy of these claims.
The current voting format introduced in 1999 is a positional voting system, similar to that used at the Eurovision Song Contest. The voting is made up of two segments, in the first of which juries announce their votes; in the second segment, the televoting result is announced. The total value of votes has usually been 2 x 473 points (2 x 638 since 2018), which means that tele-votes and juries have an equal 50/50 weighing in the final result. The juries, usually 11, have represented either Swedish regions or, since 2010, countries participating in the year&#x27;s Eurovision Song Contest. Until 2017, each jury awarded 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 points to their top seven songs; however, since 2018, the points have been changed to 1 to 7, 8, 10 and 12 points. After the jury voting, the televoting result is revealed by the hosts in ascending order. Between 1999 and 2010, the televoting points were fixed; the top seven songs would receive 11, 22, 44, 66, 88, 110 and 132 points (12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, and 144 points for the 2009 contest). Between 2011 and 2018, televoting points are given to each entry based on its percentage of the total vote. If an entry receives 10% of the televotes it will be equivalent to 10% of 473 points, i.e. 47–48 points (or 638 and 63–64 points respectively in 2018). Starting in 2019, the public votes are separated by age groups, each giving 1 to 7, 8, 10 and 12 points in the final to the songs. The song with the highest number of points at the end of the voting is the winner.

Telephone lines open immediately after the radio preview for the final and do not close until the juries have voted. Two telephone numbers are used for each song, giving voters the option of whether to donate money to SVT&#x27;s charity appeal or not as they vote. Viewers can also vote by text message, and only residents of Sweden can vote.

The votes of the juries are announced by spokespeople who are not members of the juries. The votes are read in ascending order, beginning with one point and finishing with twelve. When read, they are repeated by the host, for example:

Spokesperson: &quot;&quot; (&quot;One point to song number two.&quot;)
Presenter: &quot; [song name].&quot; (&quot;One point to [song name].&quot;)

Since 2010, most spokespeople have announced the points in English, with the hosts repeating them in Swedish.

As the votes are announced, they are collated on a graphic scoreboard. SVT varies the way the jury votes are announced from year to year. For example, the finalists of &quot;&quot; acted as spokespeople in 2004, and in 2006 Fredrik Lindström announced jury tallies using the dialects of each region. The final of Melodifestivalen has broken Nordic voting records on several occasions; in 2007, voting figures exceeded two million for the first time.

If there is a tie, the song that has received more votes from the public receives the higher position. There have been two ties for first place in the history of the contest. In 1969, Tommy Körberg tied for first place with Jan Malmsjö. The juries then voted for their favourite out the two, leading to Tommy Körberg winning. In 1978, Björn Skifs tied for first place with Lasse Holm and Wizex (performing together); a similar tie-break process resulting in Skifs winning.

== Winners ==

Sixty-one of Sweden&#x27;s sixty-two Eurovision representatives have come from Melodifestivalen; the 2020 winner was scheduled to participate in Eurovision before that event was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sweden has won the Eurovision Song Contest seven times: in 1974, 1984, 1991, 1999, 2012, 2015 and 2023. As of 2023, Sweden is tied with Ireland with the highest number of wins for a country at Eurovision, with seven each. The 1974 Eurovision winner, ABBA&#x27;s &quot;Waterloo&quot;, was voted the most popular Melodifestivalen song of all time at the gala in March 2005. Later that year, it was voted the most popular Eurovision song of the contest&#x27;s first fifty years at a gala in Copenhagen. The following table list shows those Swedish entries which finished fifth or higher at Eurovision:


== Rules ==
Most of Melodifestivalen&#x27;s rules are dictated by those of the Eurovision Song Contest. However, regulations have been introduced by the Swedish broadcasters. The competition&#x27;s official rules are released by SVT early in preparation for each year&#x27;s Melodifestivalen to ensure any changes are noted by songwriters and performers.

There was a limit of six people on stage for each performance. This included the Melodifestivalen choir (, literally &quot;the house choir&quot;), a five-person group of flexible backing singers used by most participants. Artists could use some or all of the back-up singers, or use their own group. All vocals had to be completely live; human voices were not allowed on backing tracks. However, from 2009, the number of performers allowed on stage was eight, and voices were allowed on backing tracks. A live orchestra was used every year from the event&#x27;s debut to 2000, except 1985 and 1986. Two orchestras were used between 1960 and 1963, a large orchestra and , a jazz quartet. Since 2001, participants have performed to backing tracks.

Entries cannot be publicly broadcast until the heats are previewed on radio. Entries eliminated in the heats may be broadcast as soon as the heat has finished. An embargo is placed on songs that qualify for the later rounds until the previews for the Second Chance are broadcast. After this, restrictions on the broadcast of contestant songs are lifted.

Broadcasters sometimes make sweeping changes to winning songs before they go to Eurovision. For example, at Melodifestivalen 1961, Siw Malmkvist won with &quot;April, April&quot;. Performing after her victory, she stumbled on the lyrics of the song and laughed out loud. The press criticised this as childish. SR replaced her with Lill-Babs for the Eurovision Song Contest. The 1987 winner &quot;Fyra bugg och en Coca Cola&quot;, performed by Lotta Engberg, is another example; the song&#x27;s title was changed to &quot;Boogaloo&quot; for Eurovision, as use of a brand name was against the Contest&#x27;s rules. This name was chosen as Sweden&#x27;s two previous Eurovision winners had also included the suffix &quot;-loo&quot;.

Until 1999, competing songs were only permitted in Swedish, apart from 1965, 1973, 1974, 1975. This did not stop most winning entries recording English (and other-language) versions of their songs. Since the abolition of Eurovision&#x27;s language restrictions in 1999, regardless of the performance language at Melodifestivalen, every Swedish entry has been in English. Spanish, French, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Bosnian and Persian are among the other languages to have featured. Cameron Cartio&#x27;s entry in Melodifestivalen 2005 was performed in a constructed language.

== Media coverage ==
Melodifestivalen is broadcast on television, radio and the Internet. It is broadcast on SVT1 with international coverage on SVT World and later SVT Play. Until 1987, the competition was broadcast on Sveriges Radio TV, later known as TV1. Between 1988 and 2000, the event was broadcast on different channels depending on where it was held. Finals in Stockholm were broadcast on Kanal 1 (formerly TV1) while finals in Gothenburg or Malmö were broadcast on TV2. Sveriges Radio has broadcast the event on P1, P3 and P4, where is currently broadcast.

Although the final is traditionally held on a Saturday, in 1990 it was held on a Friday. TV2 suggested this would attract more viewers. In 1991, it was held on Easter Sunday for the same reason. The 2002 final was delayed by a week for coverage of the 2002 Winter Olympics.

The competition has had an official website since 1999. Webcasts have been provided since 2005. Since 2006, between February and the Eurovision final in May, SR has webcast a radio station dedicated to the competition called &quot;P4 Melodifest&quot;. On P4, the public previews the heats participants every Friday. Broadcast the night after the final, a (&quot;the day after&quot;) television programme acts as an epilogue to the event. It gauges the reactions of the finalists after the competition&#x27;s climax. No commentary is given for the event on television. Carolina Norén is commentator on the event for Sveriges Radio. The festival has been broadcast in widescreen since 2002 and Dolby Digital since 2004.

The competition&#x27;s viewing figures have been rising since 2002. In 2007, approximately 4.1 million Swedes—almost 44% of the country&#x27;s population—watched the final, and between 2.9 million and 3.2 million viewers watched each of the heats. The viewing figures for the 2007 festival are nearly two million short of the highest recorded viewing figures from 1990. Melodifestivalen is given heavy coverage in the Swedish press. A study by the Economic Science and Communication Department at Karlstad University concluded that coverage from the press may have influenced the results of the 2007 festival.

== Musical styles and presentation ==
Melodifestivalen&#x27;s image has evolved throughout its existence, but one word has defined the competition&#x27;s music: &quot;schlager&quot;. In Sweden, &quot;schlager&quot; (a German word literally meaning a &quot;hit&quot;) represents any song associated with the competition, from the jazz music featured heavily in the 1960s to entries such as Linda Bengtzing&#x27;s in 2006. Christine Demsteader of &quot;The Local&quot; described Swedish schlager as &quot;typically characterized by an annoyingly repetitive melody and trivial lyrics of little or no meaning&quot;.

Jazz artists such as Monica Zetterlund and Östen Warnerbring won the event in the 1960s. ABBA, who won Eurovision in 1974, went on to be Sweden&#x27;s most successful music export. The group influenced not only Melodifestivalen, but the entire Swedish mainstream music scene. In the 1980s, Bert Karlsson&#x27;s Mariann Grammofon record label was responsible for the prevalence of &quot;easy, memorable tunes&quot;. The early twenty-first century has seen more variety in the competition, such as Afro-dite&#x27;s 2002 disco winner and The Ark&#x27;s 2007 &quot;retro glam rock&quot; effort.

On-stage gimmicks have long been a part of performances at the competition. Lena Philipsson&#x27;s use of a microphone stand in her performance of &quot;&quot; at the 2004 competition is an example. When Philipsson hosted Melodifestivalen in 2006, four tongue-in-cheek short films were broadcast during the heats to show what had happened to the microphone stand in the years since her win. Pyrotechnics are another common gimmick in Melodifestivalen performances. After the 2007 event, Karolina Lassbo of &quot;Dagens Media&quot; criticised the festival&#x27;s musical content and production, arguing that the 1988 competition was &quot;the time when Melodifestivalen was still a schlager competition&quot; and the event had become &quot;a cross between [reality series] &quot;Fame Factory&quot; and [inter-city game show] &quot;Stadskampen&quot;&quot;.

<doc id="331429" wikidata="Q427418" url="?curid=331429" title="Theobald Smith">
<text>Theobald Smith FRS(For) HFRSE (July 31, 1859 – December 10, 1934) was a pioneering epidemiologist, bacteriologist, pathologist and professor. Smith is widely considered to be America&#x27;s first internationally-significant medical research scientist.

Smith&#x27;s research work included the study of babesiosis (originally known as &quot;Texas cattle fever&quot;) and the more-general epidemiology of cattle diseases caused by tick borne diseases. He also described the bacterium &quot;Salmonella enterica&quot; (formerly called &quot;Salmonella choleraesuis&quot;), a species of &quot;Salmonella&quot;, named for the Bureau of Animal Industry chief Daniel E. Salmon. Additional work in studying the phenomena of anaphylaxis led to it being referred to as the &quot;Theobald Smith phenomenon&quot;. 

Smith taught at Columbian University (now George Washington University) and established the school&#x27;s department of bacteriology, the first at a medical school in the United States. He later worked at Harvard University and the Rockefeller Institute.

== Education ==
Smith was born in Albany, New York, the son of Philip Smith and his wife, Theresa Kexel.

He received a Bachelor of Philosophy degree from Cornell University in 1881, followed by an MD from Albany Medical College in 1883. 

After his graduation from medical school, Smith held a variety of temporary positions which might broadly be considered under the modern heading of &quot;medical laboratory technician&quot;. After some prodding by his former professors, Smith secured a new research lab assistant position with the Veterinary Division of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) in Washington, D.C., beginning his position there in December 1883.

== Research ==
Smith became the Inspector of the newly created Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI) in 1884. Established by Congress to combat a wide range of animal diseases—from infectious disease of swine to bovine pneumonia, Texas cattle fever to glanders—Smith worked under Daniel E. Salmon, a veterinarian and Chief of the BAI. Smith also discovered the bacterial type species which would eventually form the genus &quot;Salmonella&quot;. After two years of work studying the efficacy of bacterial vaccination in pigs, Smith erroneously believed he had found the causative agent of hog cholera.

Smith turned his attention to Texas fever, a debilitating cattle disease; this work is detailed in a chapter in &quot;Microbe Hunters&quot;, by Paul de Kruif. In 1889, he along with the veterinarian F.L. Kilbourne discovered &quot;Babesia bigemina&quot;, the tick-borne protozoan parasite responsible for Texas fever. This marked the first time that an arthropod had been definitively linked with the transmission of an infectious disease and presaged the eventual discovery of insects such as ticks and mosquitoes as important vectors in a number of diseases.

Smith also taught at Columbian University in Washington, D.C. (now George Washington University) from 1886 to 1895, establishing the school&#x27;s Department of Bacteriology. In 1887, Smith began research on water sanitation in his spare time, investigating the level of fecal coliform contamination in the nearby Potomac River. Over the next five years, Smith expanded his studies to include the Hudson River and its tributaries.

While Smith&#x27;s work at the BAI had been highly productive, he found the rigid federal government bureaucracy stiffing and complained about the lack of leadership from his supervisor. In 1895 Smith moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts to accept a dual appointment serving as professor of comparative pathology at Harvard University as well as directing the pathology lab at the Massachusetts State Board of Health.

Smith joined the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research as Director of the Department of Animal Pathology in 1915 and remained there until his retirement in 1929.

He was a trustee of the Carnegie Institution from 1914 until his death in 1934.

==Law of declining virulence==

Smith&#x27;s best-known contribution was the notion, long since disproved, that there would be a “delicate equilibrium” between hosts and pathogens such that they would develop a &quot;mutually benign relationship&quot; over time. This was at most an educated guess and never became a scientific theory, but it became accepted as conventional wisdom and was even called the law of declining virulence. It has been disproved and replaced by the trade-off model, which explains that each host–pathogen relationship must be considered separately, that there is no general pattern that predicts how all of these relationships will develop, and that there is definitely no inevitability of decreased virulence.

==Awards and Honors==
Smith was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1896, the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1908, and the American Philosophical Society in 1915. In 1933, Smith was awarded the Royal Society&#x27;s prestigious Copley Medal &quot;For his original research and observation on diseases of animals and man.&quot;.

<doc id="331430" wikidata="Q1929058" url="?curid=331430" title="Saunders-Roe Princess">
<text>The Saunders-Roe SR.45 Princess was a British flying boat aircraft developed and built by Saunders-Roe at their Cowes facility on the Isle of Wight. It is the largest all-metal flying boat to have ever been constructed.

The Princess had been developed to serve as a larger and more luxurious successor to the prewar commercial flying boats, such as the Short Empire. It was intended to serve the transatlantic route, carrying up to 100 passengers between Southampton, United Kingdom and New York City, United States, in spacious and comfortable conditions. To achieve this, designers decided early on to make use of newly developed turboprop technology, opting for the Bristol Proteus engine still in development to power the aircraft. The project suffered delays due to difficulties encountered in the development of the Proteus engine.

On 22 August 1952, the first prototype Princess, &quot;G-ALUN&quot;, conducted its maiden flight. Between 1952 and 1954, the first prototype performed a total of 47 test flights, including two public appearances at the Farnborough Airshow. This work was carried out under a development contract for the Ministry of Supply, the intention being that this would lead to a contract for the aircraft from British flag carrier British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC). Although the initial development contract had been successfully met, BOAC eventually decided to focus on its land-based routes using the jet-powered De Havilland &quot;Comet&quot;, instead. The era of the large flying boat had effectively ended prior to the aircraft&#x27;s completion.

Work on the Princess was ultimately cancelled after having produced three examples, only one of which flew. By the mid-1950s, large commercial flying boats were being increasingly overshadowed by land-based jet airliners. Factors such as runway and airport improvements had added to the viability of land-based aircraft, which did not have to compromise to accommodate the additional weight and drag of the boat hulls that were necessary on seaplanes, or the mitigating measures needed against the corrosion caused by seawater. Following the project&#x27;s termination, the three airframes were stored with the intention of selling them on, but upon receipt of a promising offer for the aircraft, corrosion was found to have set in while in storage. As a result, all three aircraft prototypes were subsequently scrapped.

==Development==

===Origins===
Before the Second World War, British airline Imperial Airways had successfully used large, long-range passenger flying boats such as the Short Empire and Short S.26 to build up a network of long-distance routes. These flying boats had not only pioneered new aerial routes across the British Empire which had previously not been served at all, but also passengers were transported within an unprecedented level of comfort, being provided with luxurious first-class accommodation, including a promenade, sizable galley, separate bathrooms for men and women, and individual cabins for passengers. However, operations of these flying boats had been disrupted by wartime, during which Imperial Airways had also merged with British Airways Ltd to form British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) in 1940. While restricted operations of commercial flying boats did continue, such as the use of Boeing 314s for the transatlantic route, many were requisitioned for service with the Royal Air Force (RAF), where they were typically used as maritime patrol aircraft.

During the prewar era, flying boats had been preferred for conducting long-distance flights, as unlike their land-based counterparts, they were not limited by available runway length – the majority of which were still grass-surfaced at this point – and as a long-range aeroplane would be required to carry a large load of fuel, a larger size of the aircraft could be permitted without needing to cater for factors such as limited runway and airfield sizes. In addition, for services to far-flung parts of the British Empire, the ability to land and takenoff from any available area of water was a distinct advantage for services to such places, many of which at the time had no airport facilities at all. With the end of the Second World War, flying boats services were resumed, with other types being operated, such as the Short Hythe, Short Sandringham, and Short Solent. However, the war had also produced a legacy of large runways and sizable airports formerly used for military purposes that could now meet the needs of a larger generation of land aircraft.

Even prior to the war&#x27;s end, the British Air Ministry was enthusiastic on the prospects for reviving the shuttered flying-boat routes. The ministry approached two British flying boat manufacturers – Saunders-Roe (Saro) and Short – requesting that the two firms collaborate on the development and manufacture of a new aircraft, which would emerge as the Short Shetland. As such, Saunders-Roe designed the Shetland and manufactured the wing, while Short produced the remainder of the aircraft. While two examples of the Shetland were completed, the project was considered a failure and the two flying boats were scrapped in 1951. Saunders-Roe considered the Shetland to have not resembled the flying boat that they sought to develop, but was otherwise a useful learning experience; even prior to the Shetland, the company had wanted to develop a more revolutionary flying boat.

During 1943, the chief designers of Saunders-Roe and Short had collaborated to produce a preliminary design specification for an innovative, large flying boat. This design specification defined various criteria for the proposed aircraft, which would be the largest all-metal flying boat ever built; performance criteria included a weight of 140 tons, a pressurised &quot;double-bubble&quot; hull, a 214-foot wingspan, a height of 55 feet 9 inches, and a length of 148 feet. The proposed aircraft would be capable of a cruising speed of 340 mph at an altitude of 37,000 feet, a range (dependent on payload) of 5,190–3,640 miles, and be outfitted with luxurious accommodation for a total of 104 passengers.

===Selection and delays===
During 1945, in response to an approach made by the British Ministry of Supply, which had been seeking design submissions from aviation companies for an envisioned new long-range civil flying boat, which was to operate in BOAC&#x27;s fleet to operate its transatlantic passenger services, Saunders-Roe decided to submit a bid based upon the earlier collaborative design specification. Following evaluations of a range of different propulsion methods and configurations, the design team selected the undeveloped Bristol Proteus – one of the first turboprop engines – to meet the enormous power requirements of the proposed giant flying boat. In May 1946, the bid made by Saunders-Roe was selected as the winner, leading to the company receiving an order for the production of three SR.45 flying boats.

Work on the SR.45 commenced almost immediately upon receipt of the order. From an early stage in development, progress on the programme was subject to schedule overruns and higher-than-projected costs being incurred, leading to skepticism of the flying boat&#x27;s viability within the House of Commons, which was being increasingly regarded as a high-risk initiative with unreliable costing. Specifically, designing and testing of the airframe, as well as the independently conducted development of the Proteus engine to power the SR.45, had been major contributors to the higher-than-expected costs.

In 1951, BOAC re-evaluated its standing requirements, and determined that the airline presently had no need for the Princess, or any new large flying boat. The airline had already elected to terminate its existing flying boat services during 1950. In late 1951, construction of the three Princesses was announced to proceed with the intention of using them as transport aircraft in RAF service. As announced in March 1952, though, while the first prototype would be completed, the second and third would be suspended to await more powerful engines.

=== Flight testing ===

On 22 August 1952, the prototype, &quot;G-ALUN&quot;, conducted its maiden flight, piloted by Geoffrey Tyson. The initial flight lasted for 35 minutes, in which the flying boat performed a complete circumnavigation of the Isle of Wight. According to aviation author Phillip Kaplan, the Princess had not been intended to fly that day at all, and only taxiing tests had been scheduled to take place, but Tyson had decided to proceed due to the excellent conditions present on the day. The prototype was quickly put through several test flights with the hope of being able to sufficiently ready the flying boat to appear at the 1952 Farnborough Airshow, but indications of engine reliability issues were encountered and this led to the intended flight display at Farnborough that year being abandoned.

As further testing of the prototype continued, the reliability of the engines and gearboxes continued to be problematic, but not to the extent that flight testing was prevented. Evaluation of the flying boat continued into 1953, during which particular attention was devoted towards addressing the difficulties uncovered. During the 1953 Farnborough Airshow, the prototype was displayed. Flight tests of the prototype continued until 27 May 1954, by which point the Proteus engine, once perfected, was found to be incapable of enabling the type to achieve its envisioned performance figures. &quot;G-ALUN&quot; was the only model to fly, performing 46 test flights in total during which 100 hours flight hours were accumulated.

Princess Air Transport Co Ltd was formed with the object of studying the factors affecting the operation of the Princess flying boats and to tender for their operation should the opportunity have arisen. The company&#x27;s directors were M D N Wyatt (chairman), Sir Archibald Philip Hope, 17th Baronet, Geoffrey Tyson, P D Irons, and Capt H W C Alger (general manager). About 75% of the share capital was held by Saunders-Roe Ltd and the balance by Airwork Ltd.

===Termination of production===
Following the completion of flying tests performed by the prototype, the British government exercised considerable indecision over the fate of the programme. In addition to the prototype, a further two Princesses (&quot;G-ALUO&quot; and &quot;G-ALUP&quot;) were under construction, but these would never fly. While a decision from the government was pending, the three aircraft were placed into storage, being cocooned and retained, one at Cowes and two at Calshot Spit; work on the programme hopefully would be restarted when a buyer was found.

===Proposals for reuse===
Over the ensuing years, several offers were issued with the intention of purchasing the Princesses, including two proposals which would have involved re-engining them with Rolls-Royce Tynes. In 1954, Aquila Airways had offered £1 million each for the stored Princesses, but this offer was rejected. In 1957, Saro itself had proposed the conversion of the aircraft to serve as landplane troop carriers/freighters.

In 1958, information on the Princess was shared with the United States Navy, which was at the time examining the possibility of converting the three stored aircraft to make use of nuclear power. This interest resulted in a delegation from Saro being dispatched to the US to discuss a sale of the preserved Princesses, but this interest ultimately amounted to nothing.

In 1964, the three Princesses were all purchased by Eoin Mekie on behalf of Aero Spacelines, which planned to use them as heavy-duty freight aircraft for transporting Saturn V rocket components for NASA. When the cocooning was removed, they were found to be badly corroded (the contract for maintenance and inspection of the stored aircraft had been allowed to lapse, which resulted in the airframes deteriorating rapidly), and all three Princesses were broken up by 1967. 

In the wake of the success of his Pregnant Guppy, constructor Jack Conroy discussed his concepts for other outsize transports with &quot;Air Progress&quot; in their publication, &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Aircraft&quot; (Petersen Publications, 1973). Conroy considered the creation of an outsize transport from the Princess to have been basically feasible, in that it shares a sectional double-bubble fuselage construction similar to that of the Boeing 377 Stratocruiser, on which the Guppies were based. The reason for considering producing such an aircraft was the desire of NASA to possess a means of transporting the first stage of the Saturn V rocket by air, if this were possible, to Cape Canaveral; the ability for the aircraft to conduct a water landing would also be advantageous for proximity landing at sea, or on nearby lakes in Florida. Ultimately, this plan was deemed to be impractical, though the existing Guppies continued to function throughout the Apollo program as efficient air transport of the outsize hardware used in these missions. Conroy quipped that the British were &quot;offended when we named our aircraft &#x27;The Pregnant Guppy&#x27;. Man, can you imagine what they would have said if we produced &#x27;The Pregnant Princess&#x27; !&quot;

They were the last fixed-wing commercial aircraft produced by Saunders-Roe. The company constructed one more fixed-wing design, the Saunders-Roe SR.53 mixed-power (rocket and turbojet) fighter design; aside from that venture, the company primarily concentrated its efforts on helicopters and hovercraft after this point.

== Design ==
The SR.45 Princess was a large flying boat, being the largest all-metal flying boat to have ever been constructed. The Princess featured a rounded, bulbous, &quot;double-bubble&quot; pressurized fuselage, which contained two full passenger decks; these decks had sufficient room to accommodate up to 105 passengers in great comfort. The planing bottom of the hull had only a slight step in the keel to minimize drag in the air. The Princess was powered by an arrangement of ten Bristol Proteus turboprop engines. These engines drove six sets of four-bladed propellers; of these, the inner four propellers were double, contra-rotating propellers, which were driven by a twin version of the Proteus, named the Bristol Coupled Proteus; each engine drove one of the propellers. The two outer propellers were single and each powered by a single engine.

The cockpit of the Princess was designed to be operated by two pilots, two flight engineers, a navigator, and a radio operator. Early on, the aircraft was intended to be outfitted with some form of powered flight controls, including an early fly-by-wire implementation, so pilots would be able to effectively actuate its large control surfaces, which would have to overcome equally larger forces. Designers instead decided to opt for a traditional mechanical-linkage approach that was augmented by a series of electrically driven power-assist units to effectively support actuation.

The ailerons and rudder were split into multiple sections so if a part of the servo-powered control system were to fail, a faulty section could be &quot;trailed&quot; so that it did not act against the remaining working sections. While the prototype aircraft had been fitted with advanced (but conventional) hydraulic controls, Saunders-Roe had intended production aircraft to use an analogue system featuring electrical servos with hydraulic final-control actuators. Such a system had been built and undergone ground testing, but the Princess had been terminated prior to any aircraft having been fitted with the system.

<text>Albert Clifton Ammons (March 1, 1907 – December 2, 1949) was an American pianist and player of boogie-woogie, a blues style popular from the late 1930s to the mid-1940s.

==Life and career==
Ammons was born in Chicago, Illinois. His parents were pianists, and he had learned to play by the age of ten. His interest in boogie-woogie is attributed to his close friendship with Meade Lux Lewis and also his father&#x27;s interest in the style. Both Albert and Meade would practice together on the piano in the Ammons household. From the age of ten, Ammons learned about chords by marking the depressed keys on the family pianola (player piano) with a pencil and repeated the process until he had mastered it. He also played percussion in a drum and bugle corps as a teenager and was soon performing with bands in clubs in Chicago. After World War I he became interested in the blues, learning by listening to the Chicago pianists Hersal Thomas and the brothers Alonzo and Jimmy Yancey.

In the early to mid-1920s Ammons worked as a cab driver for the Silver Taxicab Company. In 1924 he met up with his boyhood friend Meade Lux Lewis, who was also then a taxi driver. Soon the two players began working as a team, performing at club parties. Ammons started his own band at the Club DeLisa in 1934 and remained at the club for the next two years.
During that time he played with a five-piece band that included Guy Kelly, Dalbert Bright, Jimmy Hoskins, and Israel Crosby. Ammons also recorded as Albert Ammons&#x27;s Rhythm Kings for Decca Records in 1936. The Rhythm Kings&#x27; version of &quot;Swanee River Boogie&quot; sold a million copies, and their 1936 recording of &quot;Boogie Woogie Stomp&quot; has been described as &quot;the first 12-bar piano based boogie-woogie, [which] was imitated by many jazz bands.&quot;

Ammons moved from Chicago to New York City, where he teamed up with another pianist, Pete Johnson. The two performed regularly at the Café Society, occasionally joined by Lewis or by other jazz musicians, including Benny Goodman and Harry James.

On December 23, 1938, Ammons appeared at Carnegie Hall with Johnson and Lewis in &quot;From Spirituals to Swing&quot;, a concert produced by John H. Hammond, which helped launch the boogie-woogie craze. Two weeks later, the record producer Alfred Lion, who had attended the concert, started Blue Note Records, recording nine Ammons solos, including &quot;The Blues&quot; and &quot;Boogie Woogie Stomp&quot;, eight by Lewis and two duets in a one-day session in a rented recording studio.

In 1941, Ammons&#x27;s boogie-woogie music was accompanied by drawn-on-film animation in the short film &quot;Boogie-Doodle&quot;, by Norman McLaren. Ammons played himself in the movie &quot;Boogie-Woogie Dream&quot; (1944), with Lena Horne and Johnson. As a sideman with Sippie Wallace in the 1940s Ammons recorded a session with his son, the tenor saxophonist Gene Ammons. Although the boogie-woogie fad began to die down in 1945, Ammons had no difficulty securing work. He continued to tour as a solo artist, and between 1946 and 1949 recorded his last sides, for Mercury Records, with the bassist Israel Crosby, and took on the position of staff pianist with the Lionel Hampton Orchestra. In 1949 he played at the inauguration of President Harry S. Truman.

During his last years, Ammons played mainly at the Beehive Club and the Tailspin Club in Chicago. Four days before he died, he had been at the Yancey apartment listening to Don Ewell and Jimmy Yancey play. Ammons could play only one song, having just regained the use of his hands after a temporary paralysis.

Ammons died of natural causes on December 2, 1949, in Chicago, at age 42. He was interred at the Lincoln Cemetery, at Kedzie Avenue in Blue Island, Illinois.

==Legacy==
Ammons has had a wide influence on countless pianists, such as Jerry Lee Lewis, Dave Alexander, Dr. John, Hadda Brooks, Johnnie Johnson, Ray Bryant, Erroll Garner, Katie Webster and Axel Zwingenberger.

<text>Kermit Holden &quot;Pete&quot; Johnson (March 25, 1904 – March 23, 1967) was an American boogie-woogie and jazz pianist.

Tony Russell stated in his book &quot;The Blues – From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray&quot; that &quot;Johnson shared with the other members of the &#x27;Boogie Woogie Trio&#x27; the technical virtuosity and melodic fertility that can make this the most exciting of all piano music styles, but he was more comfortable than Meade Lux Lewis in a band setting; and as an accompanist, unlike Lewis or Albert Ammons, he could sparkle but not outshine his singing partner&quot;. Scott Yanow for AllMusic, wrote: &quot;Johnson was one of the three great boogie-woogie pianists&quot;, the others being Lewis and Ammons &quot;whose sudden prominence in the late 1930s helped make the style very popular&quot;.

==Biography==
Johnson was born in Kansas City, Missouri. He was raised by his mother after his father deserted the family. Things got so bad financially, Pete was placed in an orphanage when he was three. He became so homesick, however, that he ran away and returned living at home. By the age of 12, he sought out work to ease some of the financial burden at home. He worked various jobs; in a factory, a print shop, and as a shoe-shiner. He dropped out of school in the fifth grade as a result of his efforts.

Johnson began his musical career in 1922 as a drummer in Kansas City. He began piano about the same time he was learning the drums. His early piano practices took place in a church, where he was working as a water boy for a construction company. From 1926 to 1938, he worked as a pianist, often working with Big Joe Turner. An encounter with record producer John Hammond in 1936 led to an engagement at the Famous Door in New York City. In 1938, Johnson and Turner appeared in the &quot;From Spirituals to Swing&quot; concert at Carnegie Hall. After this show the popularity of the boogie-woogie style was on the upswing. Johnson worked locally and toured and recorded with Turner, Meade Lux Lewis, and Albert Ammons during this period. Ammons and Johnson appeared in the film short &quot;Boogie-Woogie Dream&quot; in 1941.

The 1938 song &quot;Roll &#x27;Em Pete&quot; (composed by Johnson and Turner), featuring Turner on vocals and Johnson on piano, was one of the first rock and roll records. Another self-referential title was their &quot;Johnson and Turner Blues.&quot; In 1949, he also wrote and recorded &quot;Rocket 88 Boogie,&quot; a two-sided instrumental, which influenced the 1951 Ike Turner hit, &quot;Rocket 88&quot;.

On three dates in January 1946, Johnson recorded an early concept album, &quot;Pete Johnson&#x27;s Housewarmin’&quot;, in which he starts out playing alone, supposedly in a new empty house, and is joined there by J. C. Higginbotham, J. C. Heard, and other Kansas City players. The recording also included parts played by Albert Nicholas, Hot Lips Page, Clyde Bernhardt. Budd Johnson, and a young singer, Etta Jones. Each has a solo cut backed by Johnson, and then the whole group plays a jam session together. On this album Johnson shows his considerable command of stride piano and his ability to work with a group. It was later re-released as &quot;Pete&#x27;s Blues&quot;.

At a nightclub in Niagara Falls, the piano was on a platform above the bar, and Johnson had to climb a ladder to get there.

In 1950, he moved to Buffalo. He encountered some health and financial problems in this period, including losing part of a finger in an accident and being partially paralyzed by a stroke. Between January and October 1953, he was employed by an ice cream company washing trucks, but supplemented his income by performing in a trio which played at the Bamboo Room in Buffalo on weekends. Johnson experienced more of the same the following year. He washed cars at a mortuary for $25 a week. In July, however, an engagement came his way at the St. Louis Forest Park Hotel, a six-week residency as the pianist at the Circus Snack Bar. Some broadcasts were made on Saturday afternoons in a program called &quot;Saturday at the Chase&quot;. Johnson was also privately recorded on July 20 and August 1, 1954, at a pair of house parties arranged at the home of Bill Atkinson, a close friend. Things remained somewhat bleak for the next four years, except for three appearances in 1955 at the Berkshire Music Barn in Lenox, Massachusetts. But he continued to record, and toured Europe in 1958 with the Jazz at the Philharmonic ensemble, despite the fact that he was feeling unwell. While in Europe he received an invitation to appear at the Newport Jazz Festival, which he did upon his return to the States, accompanying Big Joe Turner, Chuck Berry and Big Maybelle. Johnson underwent a physical examination in August, which revealed a heart condition as well as diabetes. Several strokes followed, resulting in complete loss of mobility in both hands. Four years after the series of strokes he was still disabled and was beginning to lose his eyesight. &quot;Jazz Report&quot; magazine ran a series of record auctions to raise money for Johnson. In 1964, a longtime correspondent of his, Hans Maurer, published &quot;The Pete Johnson Story&quot;. All sales proceeds went to Johnson. After an article appeared in a 1964 issue of &quot;Blues Unlimited&quot; detailing Johnson&#x27;s difficulty in receiving royalty payments other than from Blue Note and Victor, in June, Johnson was accepted as a member of ASCAP, which finally ensured that some of the royalties would be received on a regular basis.

His final live appearance was the &quot;Spirituals to Swing&quot; concert at Carnegie Hall in January 1967, his eighth and final appearance at this event. A review of the concert by Dan Morgenstern of &quot;DownBeat&quot;: &quot;Then for the concert&#x27;s most moving moment, Lieberson (the MC) escorted Pete Johnson on stage and introduced him as one of the participants in the original &quot;Spirituals to Swing&quot; and the greatest boogie-woogie pianist. Johnson had suffered a series of paralytic strokes and had not played piano for many years. His old buddy, Turner, took him by the hand, and for a moment the two middle-aged men looked touchingly like little boys. Turner dedicated &#x27;Roll &#x27;Em Pete&#x27; to his old friend, as Lieberson and Johnson were about to leave the stage. Instead, they stopped and the pianist seated himself next to [Ray] Bryant at the piano and began to play the treble part of his old showpiece, Bryant handling the bass. Johnson was a bit shaky but game, gaining in confidence as the number built in intensity.&quot;

Pete Johnson died two months later in Meyer Hospital, Buffalo, New York, in March 1967, two days before his 63rd birthday.

<doc id="331444" wikidata="Q431061" url="?curid=331444" title="Megachile rotundata">
<text>Megachile rotundata, the alfalfa leafcutting bee, is a European bee that has been introduced to various regions around the world. As a solitary bee species, it does not build colonies or store honey, but is a very efficient pollinator of alfalfa, carrots, other vegetables, and some fruits. Because of this, farmers often use &quot;M. rotundata&quot; as a pollination aid by distributing &quot;M. rotundata&quot; prepupae around their crops. Each female constructs and provisions her own nest, which is built in old trees or log tunnels. Being a leafcutter bee, these nests are lined with cut leaves. These bees feed on pollen and nectar and display sexual dimorphism. This species has been known to bite and sting, but it poses no overall danger unless it is threatened or harmed, and its sting has been described as half as painful as a honey bee&#x27;s.

== Taxonomy and phylogeny ==
&quot;Megachile rotundata&quot; is a member of the subfamily Megachilinae, which includes more than 4,000 bee species; this currently makes this family the second-largest among all bee families. This subfamily is one of four other subfamilies of Megachilidae, the other three being the Fideliinae, Pararhophitinae, and Lithurginae. Phylogenetic studies suggest that this subfamily is monophyletic. More specifically, it belongs to the genus &quot;Megachile&quot;, which contains 52 subgenera and 1,478 species. The genus &quot;Megachile&quot; consists of bees that cut leaf pieces to line their nests.
== Description and identification ==

&quot;Megachile rotundata&quot; is a European leaf-cutting bee placed in the subgenus &quot;Eutricharia&quot;, the &quot;small leaf-cutting bees&quot;; they are in length. They are partially bivoltine, meaning that under the right conditions they can produce two generations per year. These bees present a sexual dimorphism, in which the males are smaller than the females and differently marked. &quot;Megachile rotundata&quot; bees are a dark grey color. Females have white hairs all over their bodies, including on their scopae. In contrast, males have white and yellow spots on their abdomens.

== Distribution and habitat ==
&quot;Megachile rotundata&quot; is currently found on all continents except Antarctica. In North America, the species was deliberately imported to assist in the pollination of food crops, but has now become feral and widespread. &quot;M. rotundata&quot; was also introduced to New Zealand in 1971 and Australia in 1987 to assist in the pollination of alfalfa (known locally as lucerne).

=== Nest construction ===
Females construct tubular nests in a variety of sites, including rotting wood, flower stems, reeds, and soda straws. In the wild, females also create nests in small holes in the ground or in available cracks/crevices in trees or buildings. The nests are composed of a string of individual cells, as many as the space will allow. When managed for pollination, the females are induced to nest in paper cylinders similar to drinking straws or drilled blocks of wood.

Each cell is made from circular disks cut from plant leaves using the bee&#x27;s mandibles, hence the name &quot;leafcutter&quot;. Females use about 15 leaves per cell, called a concave bottom, overlapping the leaves to produce the thimble-shaped cell. While the bees do not store honey, females do collect pollen and nectar which they store in the cells of their nests. Specifically, females first regurgitate the nectar they have provisioned into the cell and then transfer the pollen that is attached to their scopa on top of the nectar. Each cell contains one pollen and nectar ball, and one egg with each cell containing a 2:1 nectar-to-pollen ratio. The completion of one cell in the nest requires between 15 and 20 provisioning trips. After the female lays her eggs, she seals the cell with circular leaf pieces.

=== Nest dimensions and sex ratio ===
Studies reveal that positioning of male and female progeny in the nest is strategic and that cell size plays a major role in the size of progeny, independent of the mother&#x27;s size. Females have been observed to lay female eggs in the inner cells and male eggs in the outer cells. With respect to sex ratios, larger cell provisions are correlated with a greater production of female offspring. Two explanations exist for these behaviors in terms of mother&#x27;s foraging behaviors: 1) The mother brings more provisions to the inner cells because she expects that female progeny will be produced there and 2) the mother chooses to fertilize her egg, and therefore promotes the production of female progeny, because she has to bring larger provision proportions to a larger cell. The sex ratio changes depending on nest size, length, and nesting material. This ratio is controlled by the female. These observations have been made for females that make their nests in tunnels. For example, a 5.5 mm tunnel diameter is associated with a 3:1 ratio and a 6.0 mm tunnel diameter is associated with a 2:1 ratio of males to females. Shorter tunnels, those that are below 5.0 cm long, are less favorable.

=== Nest recognition ===
During nest construction, females transfer olfactory cues onto their nests to facilitate nest recognition. Specifically, they transfer these hormones by running their abdomens along the nest or excreting liquid from the tip of the abdomen. The olfactory cues are especially concentrated around the nest entrance. When these olfactory cues were experimentally removed, females of &quot;M. rotundata&quot; were unable to identify their own nests, revealing the importance of these chemicals. The chemical composition of these olfactory cues includes hydrocarbons, wax esters, fatty aldehydes, and fatty alcohol acetate esters.

== Life cycle ==

As a member of the Hymenoptera order, the alfalfa leafcutter bee is haplodiploid. Adults emerge by the end of the summer through one of two developmental pathways: larvae will develop by the end of one summer and proceed through the a prepupal diapause phase until the next summer; or larvae, known as &quot;second-generation&quot; bees, skip this phase and emerge as adults in the same summer.

The larva transitions through four instar stages before emerging as an adult. During its development, which occurs rapidly, the larva consumes the pollen ball and enters diapause when the pollen is fully consumed. In its progression into the diapause phase, the larva defecates pellets in a ring formation and then spins its cocoon out of silk threads. The next spring, the mature larva pupates, a process that lasts 3–4 weeks, and completes its development. Once the bee is developed, it cuts its way out from the nest by chewing itself out of its cocoon.

Upon emergence, females mate immediately and begin constructing their nests after a week.

Progeny released via the two alternative pathways for emergence display different sex ratios and sizes. Among adults that emerge during the summer of the same year, the sex ratio is biased towards males. Among the &quot;second-generation bees&quot;, however, the sex ratio is female biased. Further, spring-emergent adults weigh more than summer-emergent (&quot;second-generation&quot;) adults. These differences have been proposed to be attributed to the chances of survival to mating of the two sexes and the metabolic costs involved in development. Bees that undergo diapause and emerge in the spring must endure the long winter, so require more food stores. As a result, they will be larger when they mature. Another explanation has been that smaller bees mature faster, thus are able to mate more quickly when they emerge in the summer to avoid the cold, harsh conditions of the winter.

The sex ratio of the offspring also depends on the distance between nesting and foraging sites. Females have been observed and determined to bias their offspring sex ratio to males at larger flight distances from the nest.

=== Kin recognition and fratricide ===
Research on second-generation bees illustrates that kin recognition of nest mates is not a genetically based behavior. Further, fratricide has been hypothesized to be a nondiscriminatory behavior; emerging individuals treat developing siblings and non-siblings similarly. When developing in cells behind diapausing bees, inner-nesting bees either bypass the nest in front of them, retreat back to their nests until diapausing individuals emerge, or chew through the nesting cells in front of them, killing the diapausing bees. These decisions are contingent on the extent of development of delay of nestmates. For example, emerging individuals would remain in their cells when they were delayed from emerging for a relatively short period of time. When delayed for longer periods of times, however, emerging individuals would use their mandibles to destroy the cells of their nest mates. With respect to sex differences, males have been observed to bypass nests more frequently than females due to the small size of males.

== Sexual behavior ==

=== Mating ===
&quot;Megachile rotundata&quot; has been found to be a monandrous bee species. During the mating season, males attempt to obtain mates by positioning themselves at sites where female are likely to be, including foraging sites and nests. While females can mate several times, they resist male advances by restricting their mating to one sexual interaction and fleeing from these males. This behavior is attributed to female productivity during the construction of her nest and egg-laying. When harassed, females are unable to build their nests efficiently, making less foraging trips and spending a longer time overall in nest construction. Fleeing allows females to avoid being mounted. In the process of fleeing, however, females may lose their nesting materials, such as leaves and must then make an additional trip to make up for the lost materials.

=== Sexual pheromones ===
Sexual pheromones in epicuticular waxes are released by females to assist in attracting males as mates. Studies of the emissions from these waxes reveal that alkenes are the primary compound detected by males. Further, females of different ages emit different pheromones, containing different alkene compositions. In young females, substances that classify as either 7-pentacosene or 9-pentacosene are present in the highest concentrations and, in older females, 5-monoene compounds predominate. During mating season, males are able to detect these pheromones and preferentially select young females to copulate with.

== Interaction with other species ==

=== Diet ===
&quot;Megachile rotundata&quot; can feed on nectar and pollen from a variety of plants but prefer &quot;Medicago sativa&quot;. Females will immediately begin feeding after emergence during the maturation period of their eggs. During feeding, the bee will insert its proboscis into the keel of the plant. In the process, pollen is brushed onto its scopa.
=== Predators ===
Currently, 28 species are known to prey on &quot;M. rotundata&quot;, all of which have unique ways of invading and destroying their host nests. Some species include &quot;Trogoderma glabrum&quot;, &quot;Trogoderma variabile&quot;, &quot;Tribolium audax&quot;, &quot;Tribolium brevicornis&quot;, and &quot;Trichodes ornatus&quot;. &quot;T. ornatus&quot; is the most formidable predator, with females laying their eggs in cracks between leaf pieces. During development, &quot;T. ornatus&quot; larvae kill host bee larvae and consume pollen from nest provisions. When it reaches the third stage of development, it burrows into adjacent cells and consumes host larvae irrespective of host larval instar stage. In another case, female &quot;T. glabrum&quot; females lay eggs in cracks between cells at the back of the nest. As they develop, the larvae begin to consume host larvae, moving towards the front of the nest and eating females first. In a third case, &quot;T. variabile&quot; attacks &quot;M. rotundata&quot; when it is in its cocoon or the pupal stage.

=== Parasites ===
Various families of wasps are the primary parasites of &quot;M. rotundata.&quot; Some species include &quot;Pteromalus venustus&quot;, &quot;Monodontomerus obscurus&quot;, &quot;Melittobia chalybii&quot;, &quot;Diachys confusus&quot;, and &quot;Sapyga pumila&quot;. The most formidable predator of this species is &quot;P. venustus&quot;, a parasitoid wasp in which the female uses her ovipositor to sting a developing &quot;M. rotundata&quot; larvae or pupae. After stinging to paralyze its host, the female lays her eggs on the host&#x27;s surface and the development of the parasite offspring takes place. After about 15–20 weeks, adults of &quot;P. venustus&quot; emerge.

Other parasites include several species of &quot;Coelioxys&quot; and &quot;Nemognatha lutea&quot;. &quot;Coelioxys&quot; spp. take advantage of instances when females of &quot;M. rotundata&quot; are away from the nest, such as during foraging, to lay their egg in the host nest cells. Once a &quot;Coelioxys&quot; reaches the larval stage, it will kill the developing, host larva and consume all of the provisions that the host female placed in the nest. &quot;N. lutea&quot;, in contrast, initiate parasitism of hosts at foraging sites. Specifically, female &quot;N. lutea&quot; will lay their eggs on flowers and, when a bee arrives at this flower during provisioning, will secure itself, as a triungulin stage, to the bee. The triungulin will then, upon the host bee&#x27;s arrival to its nest, remove itself from the bee, entering a cell and consuming all the provisions gathered by the host female.
=== Mating ===
Males of the species may, presumably by mistake, attempt to mate with other bee species that are using the same foraging areas as female leaf cutters. They follow several inches behind their intended partner, whether a leaf cutter or bumble bee, which is moving around a plant seeking a flower; then when the target does alight, the male leaf cutter darts rapidly onto the target&#x27;s back. This causes bumble bees and nonreceptive female leaf cutters to move to another flower and in the process shed the male leaf cutter. The male may then move right to the next prospect, or may first stop for a sip of nectar.

=== Disease ===
Chalkbrood disease in &quot;M. rotundata,&quot; specifically larvae, was discovered in 1974 in Nevada. This disease occurs from exposure of &quot;M. rotundata&quot; to &quot;Ascosphaera aggregata&quot;, which is introduced into the nest cells through nectar and pollen provisions that females bring back from foraging visits. Signs of chalkbrood infection have been observed to occur in the fifth-instar larvae, leading to the milky appearance of the larval hemolymph and development of a pink, tan, or gray cast in their head or abdominal regions. These changes are accompanied by the spread of pink, tan, or gray color throughout the body of the larvae, and dark-colored, fungal cysts appear under the cuticle.

A variety of microorganisms have been isolated from the alimentary canals and frass of &quot;M. rotundata&quot;. Bacteria include &quot;Bacillus firmus&quot;, &quot;B. licheniformis&quot;, &quot;B. megaterium&quot;, &quot;B. pumilus&quot;, and &quot;Streptomyces&quot; spp., and fungi include &quot;Trichosporonoides megachiliensis&quot;. With respect to the development of chalkbrood, the bacteria and fungi may promote the inhabitation of &quot;A. aggregata.&quot; This is supported by observations in chalkbrood-diseased larvae, which contain higher levels of bacteria and fungi in their guts than in healthy larvae.

In controlling chalkbrood, such methods as decontamination of nest cells and materials and shelters was initially achieved using household bleach. Current methods include paraformaldehyde fumigation.

=== Defense ===
Female alfalfa leafcutter bees have stingers, but both sexes usually use their mandibles as a defensive mechanism, usually only defending themselves when squeezed or antagonized. So, bee suits, such as those required with honey bees, are not necessary when dealing with these bees. When these bees do sting, however, they do not lose their stingers or die after stinging.

== Human importance ==

=== Human assistance in pest control ===
In managing &quot;M. rotundata&quot; for pollination, such methods as dichlorvos pest strips and ultraviolet lamps placed above liquid traps are effective in killing parasitoids, but not harming &quot;M. rotundata.&quot; Other methods of preventing parasitoid invasion include physical barriers. For example, the presence of thick artificial cavities separating the exterior from the nest and application of a felt cloth sealing to the back of the nesting board prevents parasitoid access to the nest. Another way that pest are controlled is by opening up the nesting material and cleaning the cocoons.

=== Pollination ===
&quot;Megachile rotundata&quot; was accidentally introduced into the United States during the 1940s, and its management as a pollinator leads to increases in seed production of some crops in the U.S. It has been shown to pollinate these plant species:
* &quot;Medicago sativa&quot;
* &quot;Other Legumes&quot;
* &quot;Brassica napus&quot;
* &quot;Trifolium&quot; spp.
* &quot;Vaccinium angustifolium&quot;
Such behaviors as gregarious nesting, use of leaves and nesting materials that have been mass-produced by humans, efficient pollination of &quot;M. sativa&quot;, and synchronous emergence of adult bees during alfalfa blooming period provide positive benefits for the use of these bees in agricultural development.

When these bees are supplied to farmers for pollinating crops, they are usually supplied in a dormant state called prepupal, and kept in such state by a constant temperature of about . At a time that is appropriate for the crop&#x27;s flowers, the farmer puts the prepupal form in an incubating environment, a constant temperature around The adult bees emerge from the pupal form after about 25 days at that temperature. Then, the farmer brings the bees to the field.

<doc id="331448" wikidata="Q690110" url="?curid=331448" title="Color depth">
<text>Color depth, also known as [[Bit depth (computer graphics)|bit depth]], is either the number of bits used to indicate the color of a single pixel, or the number of bits used for each color component of a single pixel. When referring to a pixel, the concept can be defined as bits per pixel (bpp). When referring to a color component, the concept can be defined as bits per component, bits per channel, bits per color (all three abbreviated bpc), and also bits per pixel component, bits per color channel or bits per sample (bps). Modern standards tend to use bits per component, but historical lower-depth systems used bits per pixel more often.

Color depth is only one aspect of color representation, expressing the precision with which the amount of each primary can be expressed; the other aspect is how broad a range of colors can be expressed (the gamut). The definition of both color precision and gamut is accomplished with a color encoding specification which assigns a digital code value to a location in a color space.

The number of bits of resolved intensity in a color channel is also known as radiometric resolution, especially in the context of satellite images.

==Comparison==
==Indexed color==

With the relatively low color depth, the stored value is typically a number representing the index into a color map or palette (a form of vector quantization). The colors available in the palette itself may be fixed by the hardware or modifiable by software. Modifiable palettes are sometimes referred to as pseudocolor palettes.

Old graphics chips, particularly those used in home computers and video game consoles, often have the ability to use a different palette per sprites and tiles in order to increase the maximum number of simultaneously displayed colors, while minimizing use of then-expensive memory (and bandwidth). For example, in the ZX Spectrum the picture is stored in a two-color format, but these two colors can be separately defined for each rectangular block of 8×8 pixels.

The palette itself has a color depth (number of bits per entry). While the best VGA systems only offered an 18-bit (262,144 color) palette from which colors could be chosen, all color Macintosh video hardware offered a 24-bit (16 million color) palette. 24-bit palettes are nearly universal on any recent hardware or file format using them.

If instead the color can be directly figured out from the pixel values, it is &quot;direct color&quot;. Palettes were rarely used for depths greater than 12 bits per pixel, as the memory consumed by the palette would exceed the necessary memory for direct color on every pixel.

==List of common depths==

===1-bit color===

2 colors, often black and white direct color. Sometimes 1 meant black and 0 meant white, the inverse of modern standards. Most of the first graphics displays were of this type, the X Window System was developed for such displays, and this was assumed for a 3M computer. In the late 1980s there were professional displays with resolutions up to 300 dpi (the same as a contemporary laser printer) but color proved more popular.

===2-bit color===
4 colors, usually from a selection of fixed palettes. Gray-scale early NeXTstation, color Macintoshes, Atari ST medium resolution.

===3-bit color===
8 colors, almost always all combinations of full-intensity red, green, and blue. Many early home computers with TV displays, including the ZX Spectrum and BBC Micro.

===4-bit color===
16 colors, usually from a selection of fixed palettes. Used by IBM CGA (at the lowest resolution), EGA, and by the least common denominator VGA standard at higher resolution. Color Macintoshes, Atari ST low resolution, Commodore 64, and Amstrad CPCs also supported 4-bit color.

===5-bit color===
32 colors from a programmable palette, used by the Original Amiga chipset.

===6-bit color===
64 colors. Used by the Master System, Enhanced Graphics Adapter, GIME for TRS-80 Color Computer 3, Pebble Time smartwatch (64 color e-paper display), and Parallax Propeller using the reference VGA circuit.

===8-bit color===

256 colors, usually from a fully-programmable palette: Most early color Unix workstations, Super VGA, color Macintosh, Atari TT, Amiga AGA chipset, Falcon030, Acorn Archimedes. Both X and Windows provided elaborate systems to try to allow each program to select its own palette, often resulting in incorrect colors in any window other than the one with focus.

Some systems placed a color cube in the palette for a direct-color system (and so all programs would use the same palette). Usually fewer levels of blue were provided than others, since the normal human eye is less sensitive to the blue component than to either red or green (two thirds of the eye&#x27;s receptors process the longer wavelengths).
Popular sizes were:
* 6×6×6 (web-safe colors), leaving 40 colors for a gray ramp, or for programmable palette entries.
* 8×8×4. 3 bits of R and G, 2 bits of B, the correct value can be computed from a color without using multiplication. Used, among others, in the MSX2 system series of computers.
* a 6×7×6 color cube, leaving 4 colors for a programmable palette or grays.
* a 6×8×5 cube, leaving 16 colors for a programmable palette or grays.

===12-bit color===
4,096 colors, usually from a fully-programmable palette (though it was often set to a 16×16×16 color cube). Some Silicon Graphics systems, Color NeXTstation systems, and Amiga systems in HAM mode have this color depth.

RGBA4444, a related 16 bpp representation providing the color cube and 16 levels of transparency, is a common texture format in mobile graphics.

===High color (15/16-bit)===

In high-color systems, two bytes (16 bits) are stored for each pixel. Most often, each component (R, G, and B) is assigned 5 bits, plus one unused bit (or used for a mask channel or to switch to indexed color); this allows 32,768 colors to be represented. However, an alternate assignment which reassigns the unused bit to the G channel allows 65,536 colors to be represented, but without transparency. These color depths are sometimes used in small devices with a color display, such as mobile phones, and are sometimes considered sufficient to display photographic images. Occasionally 4 bits per color are used plus 4 bits for alpha, giving 4,096 colors. Among the first hardware to use the standard were the Sharp X68000 and IBM&#x27;s Extended Graphics Array (XGA).

The term &quot;high color&quot; has recently been used to mean color depths greater than 24 bits.

===18-bit===

Almost all of the least expensive LCDs (such as typical twisted nematic types) provide 18-bit color (64×64×64 = 262,144 combinations) to achieve faster color transition times, and use either dithering or frame rate control to approximate 24-bit-per-pixel true color, or throw away 6 bits of color information entirely. More expensive LCDs (typically IPS) can display 24-bit color depth or greater.
===True color (24-bit)===

24 bits almost always use 8 bits each of R, G, and B (8 bpc). As of 2018, 24-bit color depth is used by virtually every computer and phone display and the vast majority of image storage formats. Almost all cases of 32 bits per pixel assigns 24 bits to the color, and the remaining 8 are the alpha channel or unused.

224 gives 16,777,216 color variations. The human eye can discriminate up to ten million colors, and since the gamut of a display is smaller than the range of human vision, this means this should cover that range with more detail than can be perceived. However, displays do not evenly distribute the colors in human perception space, so humans can see the changes between some adjacent colors as color banding. Monochromatic images set all three channels to the same value, resulting in only 256 different colors; some software attempts to dither the gray level into the color channels to increase this, although in modern software this is more often used for subpixel rendering to increase the space resolution on LCD screens where the colors have slightly different positions.

The DVD-Video and Blu-ray Disc standards support a bit depth of 8 bits per color in YCbCr with 4:2:0 chroma subsampling. YCbCr can be losslessly converted to RGB.

MacOS refers to 24-bit color as &quot;millions of colors&quot;. The term &quot;true color&quot; is sometimes used to mean what this article is calling &quot;direct color&quot;. It is also often used to refer to all color depths greater or equal to 24.

===Deep color (30-bit)===
&quot;Deep color&quot; consists of a billion or more colors. 230 is 1,073,741,824. Usually this is 10 bits each of red, green, and blue (10 bpc). If an alpha channel of the same size is added then each pixel takes 40 bits.

Some earlier systems placed three 10-bit channels in a 32-bit word, with 2 bits unused (or used as a 4-level alpha channel); the Cineon file format, for example, used this. Some SGI systems had 10- (or more) bit digital-to-analog converters for the video signal and could be set up to interpret data stored this way for display. BMP files define this as one of its formats, and it is called &quot;HiColor&quot; by Microsoft.

Video cards with 10 bits per component started coming to market in the late 1990s. An early example was the Radius ThunderPower card for the Macintosh, which included extensions for QuickDraw and Adobe Photoshop plugins to support editing 30-bit images. Some vendors call their 24-bit color depth with FRC panels 30-bit panels; however, true deep color displays have 10-bit or more color depth without FRC.

The HDMI 1.3 specification defines a bit depth of 30 bits (as well as 36 and 48 bit depths).
In that regard, the Nvidia Quadro graphics cards manufactured after 2006 support 30-bit deep color and Pascal or later GeForce and Titan cards when paired with the Studio Driver as do some models of the Radeon HD 5900 series such as the HD 5970. The ATI FireGL V7350 graphics card supports 40- and 64-bit pixels (30 and 48 bit color depth with an alpha channel).

The DisplayPort specification also supports color depths greater than 24 bpp in version 1.3 through &quot;VESA Display Stream Compression, which uses a visually lossless low-latency algorithm based on predictive DPCM and YCoCg-R color space and allows increased resolutions and color depths and reduced power consumption.&quot;

At WinHEC 2008, Microsoft announced that color depths of 30 bits and 48 bits would be supported in Windows 7, along with the wide color gamut scRGB.

High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC or H.265) defines the Main 10 profile, which allows for 8 or 10 bits per sample with 4:2:0 chroma subsampling. The Main 10 profile was added at the October 2012 HEVC meeting based on proposal JCTVC-K0109 which proposed that a 10-bit profile be added to HEVC for consumer applications. The proposal stated that this was to allow for improved video quality and to support the Rec. 2020 color space that will be used by UHDTV. The second version of HEVC has five profiles that allow for a bit depth of 8 bits to 16 bits per sample.

As of 2020, some smartphones have started using 30-bit color depth, such as the OnePlus 8 Pro, Oppo Find X2 &amp; Find X2 Pro, Sony Xperia 1 II, Xiaomi Mi 10 Ultra, Motorola Edge+, ROG Phone 3 and Sharp Aquos Zero 2.

=== 36-bit ===
Using 12 bits per color channel produces 36 bits, 68,719,476,736 colors. If an alpha channel of the same size is added then there are 48 bits per pixel.

=== 48-bit ===
Using 16 bits per color channel produces 48 bits, 281,474,976,710,656 colors. If an alpha channel of the same size is added then there are 64 bits per pixel.

Image editing software such as Adobe Photoshop started using 16 bits per channel fairly early in order to reduce the quantization on intermediate results (i.e. if an operation is divided by 4 and then multiplied by 4, it would lose the bottom 2 bits of 8-bit data, but if 16 bits were used it would lose none of the 8-bit data). In addition, digital cameras are able to produce 10 or 12 bits per channel in their raw data; as 16 bits is the smallest addressable unit larger than that, using it would make it easier to manipulate the raw data.

== Expansions ==

===High dynamic range and wide gamut===
Some systems started using those bits for numbers outside the 0–1 range rather than for increasing the resolution. Numbers greater than 1 were for colors brighter than the display could show, as in high-dynamic-range imaging (HDRI). Negative numbers can increase the gamut to cover all possible colors, and for storing the results of filtering operations with negative filter coefficients. The Pixar Image Computer used 12 bits to store numbers in the range [-1.5, 2.5), with 2 bits for the integer portion and 10 for the fraction. The Cineon imaging system used 10-bit professional video displays with the video hardware adjusted so that a value of 95 was black and 685 was white. The amplified signal tended to reduce the lifetime of the CRT.

===Linear color space and floating point===
More bits also encouraged the storage of light as linear values, where the number directly corresponds to the amount of light emitted. Linear levels makes calculation of computer graphics much easier. However, linear color results in disproportionately more samples near white and fewer near black, so the quality of 16-bit linear is about equal to 12-bit sRGB.

Floating point numbers can represent linear light levels spacing the samples semi-logarithmically. Floating point representations also allow for drastically larger dynamic ranges as well as negative values. Most systems first supported 32-bit per channel single-precision, which far exceeded the accuracy required for most applications. In 1999, Industrial Light &amp; Magic released the open standard image file format OpenEXR which supported 16-bit-per-channel half-precision floating-point numbers. At values near 1.0, half precision floating point values have only the precision of an 11-bit integer value, leading some graphics professionals to reject half-precision in situations where the extended dynamic range is not needed.

===More than three primaries===
Virtually all television displays and computer displays form images by varying the strength of just three primary colors: red, green, and blue. For example, bright yellow is formed by roughly equal red and green contributions, with no blue contribution.

For storing and manipulating images, alternative ways of expanding the traditional triangle exist: One can convert image coding to use fictitious primaries, that are not physically possible but that have the effect of extending the triangle to enclose a much larger color gamut. An equivalent, simpler change is to allow negative numbers in color channels, so that the represented colors can extend out of the color triangle formed by the primaries. However these only extend the colors that can be represented in the image encoding; neither trick extends the gamut of colors that can actually be rendered on a display device.
Supplementary colors can widen the color gamut of a display, since it is no longer limited to the interior of a triangle formed by three primaries at its corners, e.g. the CIE 1931 color space. Recent technologies such as Texas Instruments&#x27;s &quot;BrilliantColor&quot; augment the typical red, green, and blue channels with up to three other primaries: cyan, magenta, and yellow. Cyan would be indicated by negative values in the red channel, magenta by negative values in the green channel, and yellow by negative values in the blue channel, validating the use of otherwise fictitious negative numbers in the color channels. 

Mitsubishi and Samsung (among others) use &quot;BrilliantColor&quot; in some of their TV sets to extend the range of displayable colors.
The Sharp Aquos line of televisions has introduced Quattron technology, which augments the usual RGB pixel components with a yellow subpixel. However, formats and media that allow or make use of the extended color gamut are at present extremely rare.

Because humans are overwhelmingly trichromats or dichromats one might suppose that adding a fourth &quot;primary&quot; color could provide no practical benefit. However humans can see a broader range of colors than a mixture of three colored lights can display. The deficit of colors is particularly noticeable in saturated shades of bluish green (shown as the left upper grey part of the horseshoe in the diagram) of RGB displays: Most humans can see more vivid blue-greens than any color video screen can display.

<text>An oyster pirate is a person who poaches oysters. It was a term that became popular on both the West Coast of the United States and the East Coast of the United States during the 19th century.

== San Francisco Bay oyster pirates and the works of Jack London ==
The term &quot;oyster pirate&quot; appeared in several literary works by Jack London. London usually used the term without explanation (&quot;I wanted to be where the winds of adventure blew. And the winds of adventure blew the oyster pirate sloops up and down San Francisco Bay&quot;). Writers about London also use the term without explanation (&quot;he was a sailor, seal-hunter, tramp, fish warden, oyster pirate, cannery worker, jailbird, boxer, and gold digger&quot;), as if everyone knew the meaning of the term.

In the context of Jack London&#x27;s life, it refers to a specific set of conditions peculiar to the oyster industry in San Francisco Bay in the 1880s. While San Francisco Bay had a native oyster (the same species found elsewhere on the Pacific Coast), it was never very abundant. By the early 1850s, entrepreneurs began importing oysters from Shoalwater Bay (now Willapa Bay), Washington Territory. Native West coast oysters were much smaller and had a different flavor from those from the East coast. When the transcontinental railroad was completed, large fishery companies in the east sold juvenile oysters to San Francisco entrepreneurs who purchased submerged land from the State of California and grew oysters from transplanted Eastern stock.

By the 1880s the handful of competing oyster companies began consolidating into a single monopoly. Their harvest of a private commodity from a public space, the San Francisco Bay, led to an opportunity for oyster pirates. Pirates raided the oyster beds at night and sold their take in the Oakland markets in the morning. The public disliked the Southern Pacific and the oyster growers, and liked cheap oysters. As a result, the oyster pirates had considerable public sympathy and police were reluctant to take action against them.

Jack London described oyster piracy in his autobiographical &quot;alcoholic memoirs&quot;, &quot;John Barleycorn&quot;, in the form of romanticized juvenile fiction in &quot;&quot;, and from the opposing point of view of the California Fish Patrol in &quot;A Raid on the Oyster Pirates,&quot; from &quot;&quot;. Oyster pirating was also listed as one of London&#x27;s first occupations, after leaving a cannery at the age of fifteen, by Abraham Rothberg in an Introduction to &quot;The Great Adventure Stories of Jack London&quot; (1967) and by Eric Hanson in &quot;A Book of Ages&quot; (2008). London owned a boat which he used as an oyster pirate, whose purchase was funded by a loan from his black nanny Virginia Prentiss.

== East Coast and Chesapeake Bay oyster pirates ==
Oyster pirates also operated on the east coast of the United States beginning in the 18th century. These disputes often focused on increased privatization of what had been public rights, providing an obvious inspiration for later West Coast activities. Oyster pirates also appeared in the Chesapeake Bay, especially from the second half of the nineteenth century into the twentieth century during the Oyster Wars.

<doc id="331452" wikidata="Q1499276" url="?curid=331452" title="Yellow Peril">
<text>The Yellow Peril (also the Yellow Terror, the Yellow Menace, and the Yellow Specter) is a racist color metaphor that depicts the peoples of East and Southeast Asia as an existential danger to the Western world.

The concept of the Yellow Peril derives from a &quot;core imagery of apes, lesser men, primitives, children, madmen, and beings who possessed special powers&quot;, which developed during the 19th century as Western imperialist expansion adduced East Asians as the Yellow Peril. In the late 19th century, the Russian sociologist Jacques Novikow coined the term in the essay &quot;Le Péril Jaune&quot; (&quot;The Yellow Peril&quot;, 1897), which Kaiser Wilhelm II (r. 1888–1918) used to encourage the European empires to invade, conquer, and colonize China. To that end, using the Yellow Peril ideology, the Kaiser portrayed the Japanese and the Asian victory against the Russians in the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905) as an Asian racial threat to white Western Europe, and also exposes China and Japan as an alliance to conquer, subjugate, and enslave the Western world.

The sinologist Wing-Fai Leung explained the origins of the term and the racialist ideology: &quot;The phrase &quot;yellow peril&quot; (sometimes &quot;yellow terror&quot; or &quot;yellow specter&quot;)... blends Western anxieties about sex, racist fears of the alien Other, and the Spenglerian belief that the West will become outnumbered and enslaved by the East.&quot; The academic Gina Marchetti identified the psycho-cultural fear of East Asians as &quot;rooted in medieval fears of Genghis Khan and the Mongol invasions of Europe [1236–1291], the Yellow Peril combines racist terror of alien cultures, sexual anxieties, and the belief that the West will be overpowered and enveloped, by the irresistible, dark, occult forces of the East&quot;; hence, to oppose Japanese imperial militarism, the West expanded the Yellow Peril ideology to include the Japanese people. Moreover, in the late-19th and early-20th centuries, writers developed the Yellow Peril &quot;literary topos&quot; into codified, racialist motifs of narration, especially in stories and novels of ethnic conflict in the genres of invasion literature, adventure fiction, and science fiction.

==Origins==
The cultural stereotypes of the Yellow Peril originated in the late 19th century, when Chinese workers legally immigrated to Australia, Canada, the U.S., and New Zealand, where their work ethic inadvertently provoked a backlash against Chinese communities, for agreeing to work for lower wages than did the local white populations. In 1870, the French Orientalist and historian Ernest Renan warned Europeans of Eastern danger to the Western world; yet Renan had meant the Russian Empire (1721–1917), a country and nation whom the West perceived as more Asiatic than European.

===Imperial Germany===
Since 1870, the Yellow Peril ideology gave concrete form to the anti-East Asian racism of Europe and North America. In central Europe, the Orientalist and diplomat Max von Brandt advised Kaiser Wilhelm II that Imperial Germany had colonial interests to pursue in China. Hence, the Kaiser used the phrase &quot;die Gelbe Gefahr&quot; (The Yellow Peril) to specifically encourage Imperial German interests and justify European colonialism in China.

In 1895, Germany, France, and Russia staged the Triple Intervention to the Treaty of Shimonoseki (17 April 1895), which concluded the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), in order to compel Imperial Japan to surrender their Chinese colonies to the Europeans; that geopolitical gambit became an underlying cause of the Russo-Japanese War (1904–05). The Kaiser justified the Triple Intervention to the Japanese empire with racialist calls-to-arms against nonexistent geopolitical dangers of the yellow race against the white race of Western Europe.

To justify European cultural hegemony, the Kaiser used the allegorical lithograph &quot;Peoples of Europe, Guard Your Most Sacred Possessions&quot; (1895), by Hermann Knackfuss, to communicate his geopolitics to other European monarchs. The lithograph depicts Germany as the leader of Europe, personified as a &quot;prehistoric warrior-goddesses being led by the Archangel Michael against the &#x27;yellow peril&#x27; from the East&quot;, which is represented by &quot;dark cloud of smoke [upon] which rests an eerily calm Buddha, wreathed in flame&quot;. Politically, the Knackfuss lithograph allowed Kaiser Wilhelm II to believe he prophesied the imminent race war that would decide global hegemony in the 20th century.

===United States===
In 1854, as editor of the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot;, Horace Greeley published &quot;Chinese Immigration to California&quot; an editorial opinion supporting the popular demand for the exclusion of Chinese workers and people from California. Without using the term &quot;yellow peril,&quot; Greeley compared the arriving coolies to the African slaves who survived the Middle Passage. He praised the few Christians among the arriving Chinese and continued:
In 1870s California, despite the Burlingame Treaty (1868) allowing legal migration of unskilled laborers from China, the native white working-class demanded that the U.S. government cease the immigration of &quot;filthy yellow hordes&quot; of Chinese people who took jobs from native-born white-Americans, especially during an economic depression.

In Los Angeles, Yellow Peril racism provoked the Chinese massacre of 1871, wherein 500 white men lynched 20 Chinese men in the Chinatown ghetto. Throughout the 1870s and 1880s, the leader of the Workingmen&#x27;s Party of California, the demagogue Denis Kearney, successfully applied Yellow Peril ideology to his politics against the press, capitalists, politicians, and Chinese workers, and concluded his speeches with the epilogue: &quot;and whatever happens, the Chinese must go!&quot; The Chinese people also were specifically subjected to moralistic panics about their use of opium, and how their use made opium popular among white people. As in the case of Irish-Catholic immigrants, the popular press misrepresented Asian peoples as culturally subversive, whose way of life would diminish republicanism in the U.S.; hence, racist political pressure compelled the U.S. government to legislate the Chinese Exclusion Act (1882), which remained the effective immigration-law until 1943. The act was the first U.S. immigration law to target a specific ethnicity or nationality. Moreover, following the example of Kaiser Wilhelm II&#x27;s use of the term in 1895, the popular press in the U.S. adopted the phrase &quot;yellow peril&quot; to identify Japan as a military threat, and to describe the many emigrants from Asia.

===Imperial Russia===
In the late 19th century, with the Treaty of Saint Petersburg, the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) China recovered the eastern portion of the Ili River basin (Zhetysu), which Russia had occupied for a decade, since the Dungan Revolt. In that time, the mass communications media of the West misrepresented China as an ascendant military power, and applied Yellow Peril ideology to evoke racist fears that China would conquer Western colonies, such as Australia.

Imperial Russian writers, notably symbolists, expressed fears of a &quot;second Tatar yoke&quot; or a &quot;Mongolian wave&quot; following the lines of &quot;Yellow Peril&quot;. Vladimir Solovyov combined Japan and China into supposed &quot;Pan-Mongolians&quot; who would conquer Russia and Europe. A similar idea and fear was expressed by Dmitry Merezhkovskii in &quot;Zheltolitsye pozitivisty&quot; (&quot;Yellow-Faced Positivists&quot;) in 1895 and &quot;Griadushchii Kham&quot; (&quot;The Coming Boor&quot;) in 1906.

The works of explorer Vladimir K. Arsenev also illustrated the ideology of Yellow Peril in Tsarist Russia. The fear continued into the Soviet era where it contributed to the Soviet internal deportation of Koreans. In a 1928 report to the Dalkrai Bureau, Arsenev stated &quot;Our colonization is a type of weak wedge on the edge of the primordial land of the yellow peoples.&quot; In the earlier 1914 monograph &quot;The Chinese in the Ussuri Region&quot;, Arsenev characterized people of three East Asian nationalities (Koreans, Chinese, and Japanese) as a singular &#x27;yellow peril&#x27;, criticizing immigration to Russia and presenting the Ussuri region as a buffer against &quot;onslaught&quot;.

===Canada===
The Chinese head tax was a fixed fee charged to each Chinese person entering Canada. The head tax was first levied after the Canadian parliament passed the &quot;Chinese Immigration Act of 1885&quot; and was meant to discourage Chinese people from entering Canada after the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). The tax was abolished by the &quot;Chinese Immigration Act of 1923&quot;, which outright prevented all Chinese immigration except for that of business people, clergy, educators, students, and some others.

==Boxer Rebellion==
In 1900, the anticolonial Boxer Rebellion (August 1899 – September 1901) reinforced the racist stereotypes of East Asians as a Yellow Peril to white people. The Society of the Righteous and Harmonious Fists (called the Boxers in the West) was an anticolonial martial arts organization who blamed the problems of China on the presence of Western colonies in China proper. The Boxers sought to save China by killing Westerners in China and Chinese Christians or Westernized people. In the early summer of 1900, Prince Zaiyi allowed the Boxers into Beijing to kill Westerners and Chinese Christians in siege to the foreign legations. Afterward, Qing Commander-in-Chief Ronglu and Yikuang (Prince Qing), resisted and expelled the Boxers from Beijing after days of fighting.

===Western perception===
Most of the victims of the Boxer Rebellion were Chinese Christians, but the massacres of Chinese people were of no interest to the Western world, which demanded Asian blood to avenge the Westerners in China killed by the Boxers. In response, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Imperial Japan, Imperial France, Imperial Russia, and Imperial Germany, Austria–Hungary and Italy formed the Eight-Nation Alliance and dispatched an international military expeditionary force to end the Siege of the International Legations in Beijing.
The Russian press presented the Boxer Rebellion in racialist and religious terms as a cultural war between White Holy Russia and Yellow Pagan China. The press further supported the Yellow Peril apocalypse with quotations from the Sinophobic poems of the philosopher Vladimir Solovyov. Likewise, in the press, the aristocracy demanded action against the Asian threat. Prince Sergei Nikolaevich Trubetskoy urged Imperial Russia and other European monarchies to jointly partition China and to end the Yellow Peril to Christendom. Hence, on 3 July 1900, in response to the Boxer Rebellion, Russia expelled the Chinese community (5,000 people) from Blagoveshchensk. From 4 to 8 July, the Tsarist police, Cossack cavalry, and local vigilantes killed thousands of Chinese people at the Amur River.

In the Western world, news of Boxer atrocities against Westerners in China provoked Yellow Peril racism in Europe and North America, where the Chinese&#x27; rebellion was perceived as a race war between the yellow race and the white race. In that vein, &quot;The Economist&quot; magazine warned in 1905: The history of the Boxer movement contains abundant warnings, as to the necessity of an attitude of constant vigilance, on the part of the European Powers, when there are any symptoms that a wave of nationalism is about to sweep over the Celestial Empire.

Sixty-one years later, in 1967, during the Cultural Revolution, Red Guards shouting &quot;Shā!, Shā!, Shā!&quot; (English:Kill!, Kill!, Kill!&quot;) attacked the British embassy and beat the diplomats. A diplomat remarked that the Boxers had used the same chant.

===Colonial vengeance===

On 27 July 1900, Kaiser Wilhelm II gave the racist &quot;Hunnenrede&quot; (Hun speech) exhorting his soldiers to barbarism and that Imperial German soldiers depart Europe for China and suppress the Boxer Rebellion by acting like &quot;Huns&quot; and committing atrocities against the Chinese (Boxer and civilian):

Fearful of harm to the public image of Imperial Germany, the &quot;Auswärtiges Amt&quot; (Foreign Office) published a redacted version of the Hun Speech that was expurgated of the exhortation to racist barbarism. Annoyed by Foreign Office censorship, the Kaiser published the unexpurgated Hun Speech, which &quot;evoked images of a Crusade and considered the current crisis [the Boxer Rebellion] to amount to a war between Occident and Orient.&quot; However, that &quot;elaborate accompanying music, and the new ideology of the Yellow Peril stood in no relation to the actual possibilities and results&quot; of geopolitical policy based upon racist misperception.

====Exhortation to barbarism====
The Kaiser ordered the expedition-commander, Field Marshal Alfred von Waldersee, to behave barbarously because the Chinese were &quot;by nature, cowardly, like a dog, but also deceitful&quot;. In that time, the Kaiser&#x27;s best friend, Philipp, Prince of Eulenburg, wrote to another friend that the Kaiser wanted to raze Beijing and kill the populace to avenge the murder of Baron Clemens von Ketteler, Imperial Germany&#x27;s minister to China. Only the Eight-Nation Alliance&#x27;s refusal of barbarism to resolve the siege of the legations saved the Chinese populace of Beijing from the massacre recommended by Imperial Germany. In August 1900, an international military force of Russian, Japanese, British, French, and American soldiers captured Beijing before the German force had arrived at the city.

====Praxis of barbarism====
The eight-nation alliance sacked Beijing in vengeance for the Boxer Rebellion; the magnitude of the rape, pillaging and burning indicated &quot;a sense that the Chinese were less than human&quot; to the Western powers. About the sacking of the city, an Australian in China stated: &quot;The future of the Chinese is a fearful problem. Look at the frightful sights one sees in the streets of Peking... See the filthy, tattered rags they wrap around them. Smell them as they pass. Hear of their nameless immorality. Witness their shameless indecency, and picture them among your own people—Ugh! It makes you shudder!&quot;

British admiral Roger Keyes recalled: &quot;Every Chinaman... was treated as a Boxer, by the Russian and French troops, and the slaughter of men, women, and children, in retaliation, was revolting&quot;. The American missionary Luella Miner reported that &quot;the conduct of the Russian soldiers is &quot;atrocious&quot;, the French are not much better, and the Japanese are looting and burning without mercy. Women and girls, by the hundreds, have committed suicide to escape a worse fate at the hands of Russian and Japanese brutes.&quot;

From contemporary Western observers, German, Russian, and Japanese troops received the greatest criticism for their ruthlessness and willingness to wantonly execute Chinese of all ages and backgrounds, sometimes by burning and killing entire village populations. The Americans and British paid General Yuan Shikai and his army (the Right Division) to help the Eight Nation Alliance suppress the Boxers. Yuan&#x27;s forces killed tens of thousands of people in their anti-Boxer campaign in Zhili Province and Shandong after the Alliance captured Beijing. The British journalist George Lynch said that &quot;there are things that I must not write, and that may not be printed in England, which would seem to show that this Western civilization of ours is merely a veneer over savagery&quot;.

The expedition of German field marshal Waldersee arrived in China on 27 September 1900, after the military defeat of the Boxer Rebellion by the Eight-Nation Alliance, yet he launched 75 punitive raids into northern China to search for and destroy the remaining Boxers. The German soldiers killed more peasants than Boxer guerrillas because by that time, the Society of the Righteous and Harmonious Fists (the Boxers) had posed no threat. On 19 November 1900, at the &quot;Reichstag&quot;, the German Social Democrat politician August Bebel criticized the Kaiser&#x27;s attack upon China as shameful to Germany:

==Cultural fear==
The political praxis of Yellow Peril racism calls for apolitical racial unity among the White peoples of the world. To resolve a contemporary problem (economic, social, political) the racialist politician calls for White unity against the nonwhite Other who threatens Western civilization from distant Asia. Despite the Western powers&#x27; military defeat of the anticolonial Boxer Rebellion, Yellow Peril fear of Chinese nationalism became a cultural factor among white people: That &quot;the Chinese race&quot; mean to invade, vanquish, and subjugate Christian civilization in the Western world.

In July 1900, the &quot;Völkisch&quot; movement intellectual Houston Stewart Chamberlain, the &quot;Evangelist of Race&quot;, gave his racialist perspective of the cultural meaning of the Boer War (1899–1902) in relation to the cultural meaning of the Boxer Rebellion: &quot;One thing I can clearly see, that is, that it is criminal for Englishmen and Dutchmen to go on murdering each other, for all sorts of sophisticated reasons, while the Great Yellow Danger overshadows us white men, and threatens destruction.&quot; In the book &quot;The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century&quot; (1899), Chamberlain provided the racist ideology for Pan-Germanism and the &quot;Völkisch&quot; movements of the early 20th century, which greatly influenced the racial policy of Nazi Germany.

==Racial annihilation==
The Austrian philosopher Christian von Ehrenfels was fixated with the fear of the &quot;Yellow Peril&quot;, and believed that Asian peoples were a deadly threat to European civilization. Ehrenfels wrote if nothing was done to stop the rise of China, that &quot;if there is no change in current practice, this will lead to the annihilation of the white race by the yellow race&quot;. In response to this perceived threat, he wrote several radical proposals.

===The Darwinian threat===
The Yellow Peril racialism of von Ehrenfels proposed that the Western world and the Eastern world were in a Darwinian racial struggle for domination of the planet, which the yellow race was winning. That the Chinese were an inferior race of people whose Oriental culture lacked &quot;all potentialities... determination, initiative, productivity, invention, and organizational talent&quot; supposedly innate to the white cultures of the West. Nonetheless, despite having dehumanized the Chinese into an essentialist stereotype of physically listless and mindless Asians, von Ehrenfels&#x27;s cultural cognitive dissonance allowed praising Japan as a first-rate imperial military power whose inevitable conquest of continental China would produce improved breeds of Chinese people. That the Japanese&#x27; selective breeding with &quot;genetically superior&quot; Chinese women would engender a race of &quot;healthy, sly, cunning coolies&quot;, because the Chinese are virtuosi of sexual reproduction. The gist of von Ehrenfels&#x27;s nihilistic racism was that Asian conquest of the West equaled white racial annihilation; Continental Europe subjugated by a genetically superior Sino–Japanese army consequent to a race war that the Western world would fail to thwart or win.

===Polygamous patriarchy===
To resolve the population imbalance between the Eastern and the West in favor of White people, von Ehrenfels proposed radical changes to the mores (social and sexual norms) of the Christian West. Eliminating monogamy as a hindrance to global white supremacy, for limiting a genetically superior White man to father children with only one woman; because polygamy gives the yellow race greater reproductive advantage, for permitting a genetically superior Asian man to father children with many women. Therefore, the state would control human sexuality through polygamy, to ensure the continual procreation of genetically and numerically superior populations of White people.

In such a patriarchal society, only high-status white men of known genetic reliability would have the legal right to reproduce, with the number of reproductive wives he can afford, and so ensure that only the &quot;social winners&quot; reproduce, within their racial caste. Despite such radical social engineering of men&#x27;s sexual behavior, white women remained monogamous by law; their lives dedicated to the breeding functions of wife and mother. The fertile women would reside and live their daily lives in communal barracks, where they collectively rear their many children. To fulfill her reproductive obligations to the state, each woman is assigned a husband only for reproductive sexual intercourse. Ehrenfels&#x27;s social engineering for worldwide white supremacy eliminates romantic love (marriage) from sexual intercourse, and thus reduces man–woman sexual relations to a transaction of mechanistic reproduction.

===Race war===
To end what he perceived as the threat of the Yellow Peril to the Western world, von Ehrenfels proposed white racial unity among the nations of the West, in order to jointly prosecute a preemptive war of ethnic conflicts to conquer Asia, before it became militarily infeasible. Then establish a worldwide racial hierarchy organized as an hereditary caste system, headed by the white race in each conquered country of Asia. That an oligarchy of the Aryan white people would form, populate, and lead the racial castes of the ruling class, the military forces, and the intelligentsia; and that in each conquered country, the Yellow and the Black races would be slaves, the economic base of the worldwide racial hierarchy.

The Aryan society that von Ehrenfels proposed in the early 20th century, would be in the far future of the Western world, realized after defeating the Yellow Peril and the other races for control of the Earth, because &quot;the Aryan will only respond to the imperative of sexual reform when the waves of the Mongolian tide are lapping around his neck&quot;. As a racialist, von Ehrenfels characterized the Japanese military victory in the Russo-Japanese War (1905) as an Asian victory against the white peoples of the Christian West, a cultural failure which indicated &quot;the absolute necessity of a radical, sexual reform for the continued existence of the Western races of man... [The matter of White racial survival] has been raised from the level of discussion to the level of a scientifically proven fact&quot;.

==Xenophobia and racism==

===Germany and Russia===
From 1895, Kaiser Wilhelm used Yellow Peril ideology to portray Imperial Germany as defender of the West against conquest from the East. In pursuing &quot;Weltpolitik&quot; policies meant to establish Germany as the dominant empire, the Kaiser manipulated his own government officials, public opinion, and other monarchs. In a letter to Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, the Kaiser said: &quot;It is clearly the great task of the future for Russia to cultivate the Asian continent, and defend Europe from the inroads of the Great Yellow Race&quot;. In &quot;The Bloody White Baron&quot; (2009), the historian James Palmer explains the 19th-century socio-cultural background from which Yellow Peril ideology originated and flourished:


As his cousin, Kaiser Wilhelm knew that Tsar Nicholas shared his anti-Asian racism and believed he could persuade the Tsar to abrogate the Franco-Russian Alliance (1894) and then to form a German–Russian alliance against Britain. In manipulative pursuit of Imperial German &quot;Weltpolitik&quot; &quot;Wilhelm II&#x27;s deliberate use of the &#x27;yellow peril&#x27; slogan was more than a personal idiosyncrasy, and fitted into the general pattern of German foreign policy under his reign, i.e. to encourage Russia&#x27;s Far Eastern adventures, and later to sow discord, between the United States and Japan. Not the substance, but only the form, of Wilhelm II&#x27;s &#x27;yellow peril&#x27; propaganda disturbed the official policy of the Wilhelmstrasse.&quot;

====Mongols in Europe====
In the 19th century, the racial and cultural stereotypes of Yellow Peril ideology colored German perceptions of Russia as a nation more Asiatic than European. The European folk memory of the 13th-century Mongol invasion of Europe made the word &quot;Mongol&quot; a cultural synonym for the &quot;Asian culture of cruelty and insatiable appetite for conquest&quot;, which was especially personified by Genghis Khan, leader of the Orda, the Mongol Horde.

Despite that justifying historical background, Yellow Peril racism was not universally accepted in the societies of Europe. French intellectual Anatole France said that Yellow Peril ideology was to be expected from a racist man such as the Kaiser. Inverting the racist premise of Asian invasion, France showed that European imperialism in Asia and Africa indicated that the European White Peril was the true threat to the world. In his essay &quot;The Bogey of the Yellow Peril&quot; (1904), the British journalist Demetrius Charles Boulger said the Yellow Peril was racist hysteria for popular consumption. Asian geopolitical dominance of the world is &quot;the prospect, placed before the uninstructed reading public, is a revival of the Hun and Mongol terrors, and the names of Attila and Genghis are set out in the largest type to create feelings of apprehension. The reader is assured, in the most positive manner, that this is the doing of the enterprising nation of Japan&quot;. Throughout the successful imperial intrigues facilitated by Germany&#x27;s Yellow Peril ideology, the Kaiser&#x27;s true geopolitical target was Britain.

===United Kingdom===
Though Chinese civilization was admired in 18th century Britain, by the 19th century, the Opium Wars led to the creation of racialist stereotypes of the Chinese among the British public, who cast the Chinese &quot;as a threatening, expansionist foe&quot; and a corrupt and depraved people. Still, there were exceptions to popular racism of the Yellow Peril. In May 1890, William Ewart Gladstone criticized anti-Chinese immigration laws in Australia for penalizing their virtues of hard work (diligence, thrift and integrity), instead of penalizing their vices (gambling and opium smoking).

====Cultural temper====
In 1904, in a meeting about the Russo-Japanese War, King Edward VII heard the Kaiser complain that the Yellow Peril is &quot;the greatest peril menacing... Christendom and European civilization. If the Russians went on giving ground, the yellow race would, in twenty years time, be in Moscow and Posen&quot;. The Kaiser criticized the British for siding with Japan against Russia, and said that &quot;race treason&quot; was the motive. King Edward said he &quot;could not see it. The Japanese were an intelligent, brave and chivalrous nation, quite as civilized as the Europeans, from whom they only differed by the pigmentation of their skin&quot;.

The first British usage of the Yellow Peril phrase was in the &quot;Daily News&quot; (21 July 1900) report describing the Boxer Rebellion as &quot;the yellow peril in its most serious form&quot;. In that time, British Sinophobia, the fear of Chinese people, did not include all Asians, because Britain had sided with Japan during the Russo–Japanese War, whilst France and Germany supported Russia; whereas the reports of Captain William Pakenham &quot;tended to depict Russia as his enemy, not just Japan&#x27;s&quot;.

About pervasive Sinophobia in Western culture, in &quot;The Yellow Peril: Dr Fu Manchu &amp; the Rise of Chinaphobia&quot; (2014), historian Christopher Frayling noted:
====Moralistic panic====
The Limehouse district in London (which had a large Chinese element) was portrayed in the British popular imagination as a center of moral depravity and vice, i.e. sexual prostitution, opium smoking, and gambling. According to historian Anne Witchard, many Londoners believed the British Chinese community, including Triad gangsters, &quot;were abducting young English women to sell into white slavery&quot;, a fate &quot;worse than death&quot; in Western popular culture. In 1914, at the start of the First World War, the Defense of the Realm Act was amended to include the smoking of opium as proof of &quot;moral depravity&quot; that merited deportation, a legal pretext for deporting members of the Chinese community to China. This anti-Chinese moral panic derived in part from the social reality that British women were becoming more financially independent by way of war-production jobs, which allowed them (among other things) greater sexual freedom, a cultural threat to Britain&#x27;s patriarchal society. Witchard noted that stories of &quot;working-class girls consorting with “Chinamen” in Limehouse&quot; and &quot;debutantes leading officers astray in Soho drinking dens&quot; contributed to the anti-Chinese moral panic.

===United States===

====19th century====
In the U.S., Yellow Peril xenophobia was legalized with the Page Act of 1875, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, and the Geary Act of 1892. The Chinese Exclusion Act replaced the Burlingame Treaty (1868), which had encouraged Chinese migration, and provided that &quot;citizens of the United States in China, of every religious persuasion, and Chinese subjects, in the United States, shall enjoy entire liberty of conscience, and shall be exempt from all disability or persecution, on account of their religious faith or worship, in either country&quot;, withholding only the right of naturalized citizenship.

In Tombstone, Arizona, sheriff Johnny Behan and mayor John Clum organized the &quot;Anti-Chinese League&quot; in 1880, which was reorganized into the &quot;Anti-Chinese Secret Society of Cochise County&quot; in 1886. In 1880, the Yellow Peril pogrom of Denver featured the lynching of a Chinese man and the destruction of Denver&#x27;s Chinatown ghetto. In 1885, the Rock Springs massacre of 28 miners destroyed a Wyoming Chinese community. In Washington Territory, Yellow Peril fear provoked the Attack on Squak Valley Chinese laborers, 1885; the arson of the Seattle Chinatown; and the Tacoma riot of 1885, by which the local white inhabitants expelled the Chinese community from their towns. In Seattle, the Knights of Labor expelled 200 Chinese people with the Seattle riot of 1886. In Oregon, 34 Chinese gold miners were ambushed, robbed, and killed in the Hells Canyon Massacre (1887). Moreover, concerning the experience of being Chinese in the 19th-century U.S., in the essay &quot;A Chinese View of the Statue of Liberty&quot; (1885), Sauum Song Bo said:

====20th century====
Under nativist political pressure, the Immigration Act of 1917 established an Asian Barred Zone of countries from which immigration to the U.S. was forbidden. The Cable Act of 1922 (Married Women&#x27;s Independent Nationality Act) guaranteed citizenship to independent women unless they were married to a nonwhite alien ineligible for naturalization. Asian men and women were excluded from American citizenship except for natural born citizens.

In practice, the Cable Act of 1922 reversed some racial exclusions, and granted independent woman citizenship exclusively to women married to white men. Analogously, the Cable Act allowed the government to revoke the citizenship of an American white woman married an Asian man. The law was formally challenged before the Supreme Court, with the case of &quot;Takao Ozawa v. United States&quot; (1922), whereby a Japanese American man tried to demonstrate that the Japanese people are a white race eligible for naturalized American citizenship. The Court ruled that the Japanese are not white people; two years later, the National Origins Quota of 1924 specifically excluded the Japanese from entering the US and from American citizenship.

====Ethnic national character====
To &quot;preserve the ideal of American homogeneity&quot;, the Emergency Quota Act of 1921 (numeric limits) and the Immigration Act of 1924 (fewer southern and eastern Europeans) restricted admission to the United States according to the skin color and the race of the immigrant. In practice, the Emergency Quota Act used outdated census data to determine the number of colored immigrants to admit to the U.S. To protect WASP ethnic supremacy (social, economic, political) in the 20th century, the Immigration Act of 1924 used the twenty-year-old census of 1890, because its 19th-century demographic-group percentages favored more admissions of WASP immigrants from western and northern Europe, and fewer admissions of colored immigrants from Asia and southern and eastern Europe.

To ensure that the immigration of colored peoples did not change the WASP national character of the United States, the National Origins Formula (1921–1965) meant to maintain the &quot;status quo&quot; percentages of &quot;ethnic populations&quot; in lesser proportion to the existing white populations; thus, the yearly quota allowed only 150,000 People of Color into the U.S.A. In the event, the national-origins Formula was voided and repealed with the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965.

====Eugenic apocalypse====
Eugenicists used the Yellow Peril to misrepresent the U.S. as an exclusively WASP nation threatened by miscegenation with the Asian Other by expressing their racism with biological language (infection, disease, decay) and imagery of penetration (wounds and sores) of the white body. In &quot;The Yellow Peril; or, Orient vs. Occident&quot; (1911), the end time evangelist G. G. Rupert said that Russia would unite the colored races to facilitate the Oriental invasion, conquest, and subjugation of the West; said white supremacy is in the Christian eschatology of verse 16:12 in the Book of Revelation: &quot;Then the sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great Euphrates River, and it dried up so that the kings from the east could march their armies toward the west without hindrance&quot;. As an Old-Testament Christian, Rupert believed the racialist doctrine of British Israelism, and said that the Yellow Peril from China, India, Japan, and Korea, were attacking Britain and the US, but that the Christian God himself would halt the Asian conquest of the Western world.

In &quot;The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy&quot; (1920), the eugenicist Lothrop Stoddard said that either China or Japan would unite the colored peoples of Asia and lead them to destroy white supremacy in the Western world, and that the Asian conquest of the world began with the Japanese victory in the Russo–Japanese War (1905). As a white supremacist, Stoddard presented his racism with Biblical language and catastrophic imagery depicting a rising tide of colored people meaning to invade, conquer, and subjugate the white race.

====Political opposition====
In that cultural vein, the phrase &quot;yellow peril&quot; was common editorial usage in the newspapers of publisher William Randolph Hearst. In the 1930s, Hearst&#x27;s newspapers conducted a campaign of vilification (personal and political) against Elaine Black, an American communist, whom he denounced as a libertine &quot;Tiger Woman&quot; for her interracial cohabitation with the Japanese American communist Karl Yoneda. In 1931, interracial marriage was illegal in California, but, in 1935, Black and Yoneda married in Seattle, Washington, where such marriages were legal.

====Socially acceptable Asian====
In the 1930s, Yellow Peril stereotypes were common to US culture, exemplified by the cinematic versions of the Asian detectives Charlie Chan (Warner Oland) and Mr. Moto (Peter Lorre), originally literary detectives in novels and comic strips. White actors portrayed the Asian men and made the fictional characters socially acceptable in mainstream American cinema, especially when the villains were secret agents of Imperial Japan.

American proponents of the Japanese Yellow Peril were the military-industrial interests of the China Lobby (right-wing intellectuals, businessmen, Christian missionaries) who advocated financing and supporting the warlord &quot;Generalissimo&quot; Chiang Kai-shek, a Methodist convert whom they represented as the Christian Chinese savior of China, then embroiled in the Chinese Civil War (1927–1937, 1946–1950). After the Japanese invaded China in 1937, the China Lobby successfully pressured the U.S. government to aid Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s faction. The news media&#x27;s reportage (print, radio, cinema) of the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–45) favored China, which politically facilitated the American financing and equipping of the anticommunist Kuomintang, the Chiang Kai-shek faction in the civil war against the Communist faction led by Mao Tse-tung.

Madame Chiang Kai-shek (Soong Mei-ling) wife of Chiang Kai-shek (President of the Republic of China), Is credited for her role in reducing anti-Chinese sentiment and influencing the repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act. She gained respect from the US administration, working closely in partnership with her husband, particularly in his Chinese foreign relations due to her excellent English. To the administration she was a sign of hope, representing the success of the US cultural exchange with China, her father having been converted to Christianity by a US missionary, and became a symbol of the US-Chinese alliance against Japan. Her popularity amongst the US population, drawing crowds of up to 30,000 on her 1943 nationwide speaking tour, changed the image of Chinese women. She was not only idolised for being glamorous, appearing on the cover of TIME magazine numerous times, but also represented a relatability due to her Christian faith and having received a good american education. The Citizens Committee to repeal Chinese Exclusion utilised her public popularity and good reputation to push for change in immigration laws. Further she influenced opinion congression on Chinese citizenship; representative Walter Judd proclaiming on national radio,

“Our exclusion of the Chinese on a racial basis also violates the finest traditions and the moral sense of the American people. Under our present laws, Hitler is admissible to our country and eligible for citizenship—Madame Chiang Kai-shek is not!”

Madame Chiang was a symbol of the modern Chinese population and changed the US perception of China. She showed the potential for modernising China to become a democratic nation.

====Pragmatic racialism====
In 1941, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the Roosevelt administration formally declared China an ally of the U.S., and news media modified their use of Yellow Peril ideology to include China to the West, criticizing contemporary anti-Chinese laws as counterproductive to the war effort against Imperial Japan. The wartime &quot;zeitgeist&quot; and the geopolitics of the U.S. government presumed that defeat of the Imperial Japan would be followed by postwar China developing into a capitalist economy under the strongman leadership of the Christian &quot;Generalissimo&quot; Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party).

In his relations with the American government and his China Lobby sponsors, Chiang requested the repeal of American anti-Chinese laws; to achieve the repeals, Chiang threatened to exclude the American business community from the &quot;China Market&quot;, the economic fantasy that the China Lobby promised to the American business community. In 1943, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was repealed, but, because the National Origins Act of 1924 was contemporary law, the repeal was a symbolic gesture of American solidarity with the people of China.

Science fiction writer William F. Wu said that American adventure, crime, and detective pulp magazines in the 1930s had many Yellow Peril characters, loosely based on Fu Manchu; although &quot;most [Yellow Peril characters] were of Chinese descent&quot;, the geopolitics of the time led white people to see Japan as a threat to the United States. In &quot;The Yellow Peril: Chinese Americans in American fiction, 1850–1940&quot; (1982), Wu said that fear of Asians dates from the European Middle Ages, from the 13th-century Mongol invasion of Europe. Most Europeans had never seen an Asian man or woman, and the great differences in language, custom, and physique accounted for European paranoia about the nonwhite peoples from the Eastern world.

====21st century====
The American academic Frank H. Wu said that anti-Chinese sentiment incited by people such as Steve Bannon and Peter Thiel is recycling anti-Asian hatred from the 19th century into a &quot;new Yellow Peril&quot; that is common to White populist politics that do not distinguish between Asian foreigners and Asian American U.S. citizens. That American cultural anxiety about the geopolitical ascent of the People&#x27;s Republic of China originates in the fact that, for the first time in centuries, the Western world, led by the U.S., is challenged by a people whom Westerners viewed as culturally backward and racially inferior only a generation earlier. That the U.S. perceives China as &quot;the enemy&quot;, because their economic success voids the myth of white supremacy upon which the West claims cultural superiority over the East. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has facilitated and increased the occurrence of xenophobia and anti-Chinese racism, which the academic Chantal Chung said has &quot;deep roots in yellow peril ideology&quot;.

===Australia===
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, fear of the Yellow Peril was a cultural feature of the white peoples who sought to establish a country and a society in the Australian continent. The racialist fear of the nonwhite Asian Other was a thematic preoccupation common to invasion literature novels, such as &quot;The Yellow Wave: A Romance of the Asiatic Invasion of Australia&quot; (1895), &quot;The Colored Conquest&quot; (1904), &quot;The Awakening to China&quot; (1909), and the &quot;Fools&#x27; Harvest&quot; (1939). Such fantasy literature featured an Asian invasion of &quot;the empty north&quot; of Australia, which was populated by the Aboriginal Australians, the nonwhite, native Other with whom the white emigrants competed for living space. In the novel &quot;White or Yellow?: A Story of the Race War of A.D. 1908&quot; (1887), the journalist and labor leader William Lane said that a horde of Chinese people legally arrived in Australia and overran white society and monopolized the industries for exploiting the natural resources of the Australian &quot;empty north&quot;.

====White nation====
As Australian invasion literature of the 19th-century, the future history novel &quot;White or Yellow?&quot; (1887) presents William Lane&#x27;s nationalist racialism and left-wing politics that portrayed Australia under threat by the Yellow Peril. In the near future, British capitalists manipulate the Australian legal system and then legislate the mass immigration of Chinese workers to Australia, regardless of the socioeconomic consequences to white Australian society. Consequent to the British manipulation of Australia&#x27;s economy, the resulting social conflicts (racial, financial, cultural, sexual) escalate into a race war for control of Australia.

The Yellow Peril racism in the narrative of the novel &quot;White or Yellow?&quot; justifies White Australians&#x27; killing Chinese workers as a defensive, existential response for control of Australia. Lang&#x27;s story of White racial replacement appeals to the fears that labor and trade union leaders exploited to oppose the legal immigration of Chinese workers, whom they misrepresented as racial, economic, and moral threats to White Australia. That Asian libertinism threatens White Christian civilization, which theme Lang represents with miscegenation (mixing of the races). The fear of racial replacement was presented as an apolitical call to white racial unity in among Australians.

Culturally, Yellow Peril invasion novels expressed themes of the white man&#x27;s sexual fear of the supposed voracious sexuality of Asian men and women. The stories feature Western women in sexual peril, usually rape-by-seduction facilitated with the sensual and moral release of smoked opium. In the patriarchal world of invasion literature, interracial sexual relations were &quot;a fate worse than death&quot; for a white woman, afterward, she was a sexual untouchable to white men. In the 1890s, that moralistic theme was the anti-Chinese message of the feminist and labor organizer Rose Summerfield who voiced the white woman&#x27;s sexual fear of the Yellow Peril, by warning society of the Chinese man&#x27;s unnaturally lustful gaze upon the pulchritude of Australian women.

====Opposition to the racial equality proposal====
In 1901, the Australian federal government adopted the White Australia policy that had been informally initiated with the Immigration Restriction Act 1901, which generally excluded Asians, but in particular excluded the Chinese and the Melanesian peoples. Historian C. E. W. Bean said that the White Australia policy was &quot;a vehement effort to maintain a high, Western standard of economy, society, and culture (necessitating, at that stage, however it might be camouflaged, the rigid exclusion of Oriental peoples)&quot; from Australia. In 1913, appealing to the irrational fear of the Yellow Peril, the film &quot;Australia Calls&quot; (1913) depicted a &quot;Mongolian&quot; invasion of Australia, which eventually is defeated by ordinary Australians with underground, political resistance and guerrilla warfare, and not by the army of the Australian federal government.

In 1919, at the Paris Peace Conference, Australian Prime Minister Billy Hughes vehemently opposed the Japanese delegation&#x27;s request for the inclusion of the Racial Equality Proposal to Article 21 of the Covenant of the League of Nations:

Hughes stated in response to the proposal that &quot;ninety-five out of one hundred Australians rejected the very idea of equality&quot;; he had entered politics as a trade unionist and, like the majority of the white Australian population, was strongly opposed to Asian immigration into Australia. Hughes believed that accepting the clause would mean the end of the White Australia policy and wrote: &quot;No Gov&#x27;t could live for a day in Australia if it tampered with a White Australia.&quot; Though UK officials in the British delegation (which Australia was a part of) found the proposal compatible with Britain&#x27;s stance of nominal equality for all British subjects as a principle for maintaining imperial unity, they ultimately succumbed to pressure from politicians in Britain&#x27;s dominions, including Hughes, and signalled their opposition to the clause.

Though conference chairman, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, was indifferent to the clause, he eventually sided with the British delegation and stipulated that a unilateral requirement of a unanimous vote by the countries in the League of Nations was required for the clause to be included. On 11 April 1919, after protracted and heated debate, a final vote was called; from a quorum of 17, the proposal secured 11 votes in favor, with no delegate from any nation voting no, though there were 6 abstentions, including all 4 from the British and American delegations; it did not pass.

===France===
====Colonial empire====
In the late 19th century, French imperialist politicians invoked the &quot;Péril jaune&quot; (Yellow Peril) in their negative comparisons of France&#x27;s low birth-rate and the high birth-rates of Asian countries. From that racist claim arose an artificial, cultural fear among the French population that immigrant-worker Asians soon would &quot;flood&quot; France, which could be successfully countered only by increased fecundity of French women. Then, France would possess enough soldiers to thwart the eventual flood of immigrants from Asia. From that racialist perspective, the French press sided with Imperial Russia during the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905), by representing the Russians as heroes defending the white race against the Japanese Yellow Peril.
In the early 20th century, in 1904, the French journalist René Pinon reported that the Yellow Peril were a cultural, geopolitical, and existential threat to white civilization in the Western world:

Despite the claimed Christian idealism of the civilizing mission, from the start of colonization in 1858, the French exploited the natural resources of Vietnam as inexhaustible and the Vietnamese people as beasts of burden. In the aftermath of the Second World War, the First Indochina War (1946–1954) justified recolonization of Vietnam as a defense of the white West against the &quot;péril jaune&quot;—specifically that the Communist Party of Vietnam were puppets of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, which is part of the &quot;international communist conspiracy&quot; to conquer the world. Therefore, French anticommunism utilized orientalism to dehumanize the Vietnamese into &quot;the nonwhite Other&quot;; which yellow-peril racism allowed atrocities against Viet Minh prisoners of war during &quot;la sale guerre&quot; (&quot;dirty war&quot;). In that time, yellow-peril racism remained one of the ideological bases for the existence of French Indochina, thus the French news media&#x27;s racialist misrepresentations of Viet Minh guerrillas being part of the &quot;innombrables masses jaunes&quot; (innumerable yellow hordes); being one of many &quot;vagues hurlantes&quot; (roaring waves) of &quot;masses fanatisées&quot; (fanatical hordes).

====Contemporary France====
In &quot;Behind the Bamboo Hedge: The Impact of Homeland Politics in the Parisian Vietnamese Community&quot; (1991) Gisèle Luce Bousquet said that the &quot;péril jaune&quot;, which traditionally colored French perceptions of Asians, especially of Vietnamese people, remains a cultural prejudice of contemporary France; hence the French perceive and resent the Vietnamese people of France as academic overachievers who take jobs from &quot;native French&quot; people.

In 2015, the cover of the January issue of &quot;Fluide Glacial&quot; magazine featured a cartoon, &quot;Yellow Peril: Is it Already Too Late?&quot;, which depicts a Chinese-occupied Paris where a sad Frenchman is pulling a rickshaw, transporting a Chinese man, in 19th c. French colonial uniform, accompanied by a barely dressed, blonde French woman. The editor of &quot;Fluide Glacial&quot;, Yan Lindingre, defended the magazine cover and the subject as satire and mockery of French fears of China&#x27;s economic threat to France. In an editorial addressing the Chinese government&#x27;s complaint, Lindingre said, &quot;I have just ordered an extra billion copies printed, and will send them to you via chartered flight. This will help us balance our trade deficit, and give you a good laugh&quot;.

===Italy===
In the 20th century, from their perspective, as nonwhite nations in a world order dominated by the white nations, the geopolitics of Ethiopia–Japan relations allowed Imperial Japan and Ethiopia to avoid imperialist European colonization of their countries and nations. Before the Second Italo-Ethiopian War (1934–1936), Imperial Japan had given diplomatic and military support to Ethiopia against invasion by Fascist Italy, which implied military assistance. In response to that Asian anti-imperialism, Benito Mussolini ordered a Yellow Peril propaganda campaign by the Italian press, which represented Imperial Japan as the military, cultural, and existential threat to the Western world, by way of the dangerous &quot;yellow race–black race&quot; alliance meant to unite Asians and Africans against the white people of the world.

In a report from the Chamber of Deputies on 2 January 1934, Marquis Giacomo Medici del Vascello wrote: &quot;Today Japan is invading China, and inspired by race hatred she is laying plans for tomorrow against the white race.&quot; The Chamber of Deputies described Japan&#x27;s withdrawal from the League of Nations as &quot;significant and threatening.&quot;

In 1935, Mussolini warned of the Japanese Yellow Peril, specifically the racial threat of Asia and Africa uniting against Europe. In the summer of 1935, the National Fascist Party often staged anti–Japanese political protests throughout Italy. Nonetheless, as right-wing imperial powers, Japan and Italy pragmatically agreed to disagree; in exchange for Italian diplomatic recognition of Manchukuo (1932–45), the Japanese puppet state in China, Imperial Japan would not aid Ethiopia against Italian invasion and so Italy would end the anti–Japanese Yellow Peril propaganda in the national press of Italy.

===Mexico===
During the Mexican Revolution (1910–1920), Chinese-Mexicans were subjected to racist abuse, like before the revolt, for not being Christians, specifically Roman Catholic, for not being racially Mexican, and for not soldiering and fighting in the Revolution against the thirty-five-year dictatorship (1876–1911) of General Porfirio Díaz.

The notable atrocity against Asian people was the three-day Torreón massacre (13–15 May 1911) in northern Mexico, wherein the military forces of Francisco I. Madero killed 308 Asian people (303 Chinese, 5 Japanese), because they were deemed a cultural threat to the Mexican way of life. The massacre of Chinese and Japanese Mexicans at the city of Torreón, Coahuila, was not the only such atrocity perpetrated in the Revolution. Elsewhere, in 1913, after the Constitutional Army captured the city of Tamasopo, San Luis Potosí state, the soldiers and the town-folk expelled the Chinese community by sacking and burning the Chinatown.

During and after the Mexican Revolution, the Roman Catholic prejudices of Yellow Peril ideology facilitated racial discrimination and violence against Chinese Mexicans, usually for &quot;stealing jobs&quot; from native Mexicans. Anti–Chinese nativist propaganda misrepresented the Chinese people as unhygienic, prone to immorality (miscegenation, gambling, opium-smoking) and spreading diseases that would biologically corrupt and degenerate &quot;La Raza&quot; (the Mexican race) and generally undermining the Mexican patriarchy.

Moreover, from the racialist perspective, besides stealing work from Mexican men, Chinese men were stealing Mexican women from the native Mexican men who were away fighting the Revolution to overthrow and expel the dictator Porfirio Díaz and his foreign sponsors from Mexico. In the 1930s, approximately 70 per cent of the Chinese and the Chinese–Mexican population was expelled from the Mexican United States by the bureaucratic ethnic culling of the Mexican population.

===Turkey===
In 1908, at the end of the Ottoman Empire (1299–1922) the Young Turk Revolution ascended the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) to power, which the 1913 Ottoman coup d&#x27;état reinforced with the Raid on the Sublime Porte. In admiration and emulation that the modernization of Japan during the Meiji Restoration (1868) was achieved without the Japanese people losing their national identity, the CUP intended to modernize Turkey into the &quot;Japan of the Near East&quot;. To that end, the CUP considered allying Turkey with Japan in a geopolitical effort to unite the peoples of the Eastern world to fight a racial war of extermination against the White colonial empires of the West. Politically, the cultural, nationalist, and geopolitical affinities of Turkey and Japan were possible because, in Turkish culture, the &quot;yellow&quot; color of &quot;Eastern gold&quot; symbolizes the innate moral superiority of the East over the West.

Fear of the Yellow Peril occurs against the Chinese communities of Turkey, usually as political retaliation against the PRC government&#x27;s repressions and human-rights abuses against the Muslim Uighur people in the Xinjiang province of China. At an anti–PRC political protest in Istanbul, a South Korean woman tourist faced violence, despite identifying herself: &quot;I am not Chinese, I am Korean&quot;. In response that Yellow Peril racism in Turkey, Devlet Bahçeli, leader of the extreme right-wing Nationalist Movement Party, rhetorically asked: &quot;How does one distinguish, between Chinese and Koreans? Both have slanted eyes&quot;.

===South Africa===
In 1904, after the conclusion of the Second Boer War, the Unionist Government of the Britain authorized the immigration to South Africa of approximately 63,000 Chinese laborers to work the gold mines in the Witwatersrand basin.

On 26 March 1904, approximately 80,000 people attended a social protest against the use of Chinese laborers in the Transvaal held in Hyde Park, London, to publicize the exploitation of Chinese South Africans. The Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress then passed a resolution declaring:

The mass immigration of indentured Chinese laborers to mine South African gold for wages lower than acceptable to the native white men, contributed to the 1906 electoral loss of the financially conservative British Unionist government that then governed South Africa.

After 1910, most Chinese miners were repatriated to China because of the great opposition to them, as &quot;colored people&quot; in white South Africa, analogous to anti-Chinese laws in the US during the early 20th century. Despite the racial violence between white South African miners and Chinese miners, the Unionist government achieved the economic recovery of South Africa after the Second Boer War by rendering the gold mines of the Witwatersrand Basin the most productive in the world.

===New Zealand===
In the late 19th and the early 20th centuries, populist Prime Minister Richard Seddon compared the Chinese people to monkeys, and so used the Yellow Peril to promote racialist politics in New Zealand. In 1879, in his first political speech, Seddon said that New Zealand did not wish her shores &quot;deluged with Asiatic Tartars. I would sooner address white men than these Chinese. You can&#x27;t talk to them, you can&#x27;t reason with them. All you can get from them is &#x27;No savvy&#x27;&quot;.

Moreover, in 1905, in the city of Wellington, the white supremacist Lionel Terry murdered Joe Kum Yung, an old Chinese man, in protest against Asian immigration to New Zealand. Laws promulgated to limit Chinese immigration included a heavy poll tax, introduced in 1881 and lowered in 1937, after Imperial Japan&#x27;s invasion and occupation of China. In 1944, the poll tax was abolished, and in 2002 the New Zealand government formally apologized to the Chinese populace of New Zealand.

==Sexual fears==

===Background===
The core of Yellow Peril ideology is the White man&#x27;s fear of seduction by the Oriental nonwhite Other; either the sexual voracity of the Dragon Lady and the Lotus Blossom stereotypes, or the sexual voracity of the Seducer. Racist revulsion towards miscegenation—interracial sexual intercourse—by the fear of mixed-race children as a physical, cultural, and existential threat to Whiteness proper. In Queer theory, the term &quot;Oriental&quot; connotes contradictory sexual associations according to the nationality. A person can be perceived as Japanese and kinky, or as Filipino and available. Sometimes, &quot;Oriental&quot; could be sexless.

===The seducer===
The seductive Asian man (wealthy and cultured) was the common White male fear of the Asian sexual &quot;other.&quot; The Yellow Peril sexual threat was realized by way of successful sexual competition, usually seduction or rape, which rendered the woman a sexual untouchable. (see: &quot;55 Days at Peking&quot;, 1963) In &quot;Romance and the &quot;Yellow Peril&quot;: Race, Sex, and Discursive Strategies in Hollywood Fiction&quot; (1994) the critic Gary Hoppenstand identified interracial sexual-intercourse as a threat to whiteness:
* In &quot;The Cheat&quot; (1915), Hishuru Tori (Sessue Hayakawa) is a sadistic Japanese sexual predator interested in Edith Hardy (Fannie Ward), an American housewife. Although superficially Westernized, Tori&#x27;s sexual sadism reflects his true identity as an Asian. In being &quot;brutal and cultivated, wealthy and base, cultured and barbaric, Tori embodies the contradictory qualities Americans associate with Japan&quot;. The story initially presents Tori as an &quot;asexual&quot; man associating among the high society of Long Island. Once Edith is in his private study, decorated with Japanese art, Tori is a man of &quot;brooding, implicitly sadistic sexuality&quot;. Before Tori attempts his rape-seduction of Edith, the story implies she corresponds his sexual interest. The commercial success of &quot;The Cheat&quot; (1915) was ensured by Sessue Hayakawa, a male sex symbol of that time; a sexual threat to the WASP racial hierarchy in 1915.
* In &quot;Shanghai Express&quot; (1932), General Henry Chang (Warner Oland) is a warlord of Eurasian origin, presented as an asexual man, which excludes him from Western sexual mores and the racialist hierarchy; thus, he is dangerous to the Westerners he holds hostage. Although Eurasian, Chang is prouder of his Chinese heritage, and rejects his American heritage, which rejection confirms his Oriental identity. In 1931, the Chinese Civil War has rendered trapped a group of Westerners into traverse China by train, from Beijing to Shanghai, which is hijacked by Chang&#x27;s soldiers. The story implies that Gen. Chang is a bisexual man who desires to rape both the heroine and the hero, Shanghai Lily (Marlene Dietrich) and Captain Donald &quot;Doc&quot; Harvey (Clive Brook). At the story&#x27;s climax, Hui Fei kills Gen. Chang to save Harvey from being blinded; she explains that killing Chang restored the self-respect he took from her. Throughout the story, the narrative indicates that Shanghai Lily and Hui Fei are more attracted to each other than to Capt. Harvey, which was daring drama in 1932, because Western mores considered bisexuality an unnatural sexual orientation.

===The Dragon Lady===
As a cultural representation of voracious Asian sexuality, the Dragon Lady is a beautiful, charming woman who readily and easily dominates men. For the White man, the Dragon Lady is the sexual Other who represents morally degrading sexual desire. In the cinematic genre of the Western, the cowboy town usually features a scheming Asian prostitute who uses her prettiness, sex appeal, and charisma to beguile and dominate the White man. In the U.S. television program Ally McBeal (1997–2002), the Ling Woo character was a Dragon Lady whose Chinese identity includes sexual skills that no white woman possess. In the late 20th century, such a sexual representation of the Yellow Peril, which was introduced in the comic strip &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot; (1936), indicates that in the Western imagination, Asia remains the land of the sexual nonwhite Other. To the Westerner, the seductiveness of the Orient implies spiritual threat and hidden danger to white sexual identity.

===The Lotus Blossom===
A variant Yellow Peril seductress is presented in the white savior romance between a &quot;White Knight&quot; from the West and a &quot;Lotus Blossom&quot; from the East; each redeems the other by way of mutual romantic love. Despite being a threat to the passive sexuality of white women, the romantic narrative favorably portrays the Lotus Blossom character as a woman who needs the love of a white man to rescue her from objectification by a flawed Asian culture. As a heroine, the Lotus Blossom woman is an ultra-feminine model of Asian pulchritude, social grace, and culture, whose own people trapped her in an inferior, gender-determined social-class. Only a white man can rescue her from such a cultural impasse, thereby, the narrative reaffirms the moral superiority of the Western world.

====Suzie Wong====
In &quot;The World of Suzie Wong&quot; (1960), the eponymous antiheroine is a prostitute saved by the love of Robert Lomax (William Holden), an American painter living in Hong Kong. The East–West sexual differences available to Lomax are two: (i) the educated British woman Kay O&#x27;Neill (Sylvia Syms) who is independent and career-minded; and (ii) the poor Chinese woman Suzie Wong (Nancy Kwan), a sexual prostitute who is conventionally pretty, feminine, and submissive. The cultural contrast of the representations of Suzie Wong and Kay O&#x27;Neill imply that to win the love of a white man, a Western woman should emulate the sexually passive prostitute rather than an independent career-woman. As an Oriental stereotype, the submissive Lotus -Blossom (Wong) &quot;proudly displays signs of a beating, to her fellow hookers, and uses it as evidence that her man loves her&quot;, which further increases Lomax&#x27;s white savior desire to rescue Suzy.

Psychologically, the painter Lomax needs the prostitute Wong as the muse who inspires the self-discipline necessary for commercial success. Suzie Wong is an illiterate orphan who was sexually abused as a girl; thus her toleration of abuse by most of her Chinese clients. Unlike the Chinese and British men for whom Suzy Wong is a sexual object, Lomax is portrayed as enlightened, which implies the moral superiority of American culture, and thus that U.S. hegemony (geopolitical and cultural) shall be better than British hegemony. When a British sailor attempts to rape the prostitute Suzy Wong, the chivalrous American Lomax rescues her and beats up the sailor, whilst Chinese men are indifferent to the rape of a prostitute. As a Lotus Blossom stereotype, the prostitute Suzie Wong is a single mother. In contrast to the British and Chinese mistreatment (emotional and physical) of Wong, the white savior Lomax idealizes her as a child–woman, and saves her with the Lotus Blossom social identity, a sexually passive woman who is psychologically submissive to paternalism. Yet Lomax&#x27;s love is conditional; throughout the story, Wong wears a Cheongsam dress, but when she wears Western clothes, Lomax orders her to only wear Chinese clothes, because Suzie Wong is acceptable only as a Lotus Blossom stereotype.

====Kim====
The musical &quot;Miss Saigon&quot; (1989), portrays Vietnam as a Third World country in need of a white savior. The opening chorus of the first song, &quot;The Heat&#x27;s on Saigon&quot;, begins thus: &quot;The heat&#x27;s on Saigon / The girls are hotter &#x27;n hell / Tonight one of these slits will be Miss Saigon / God, the tension is high / Not to mention the smell&quot;. In Saigon City, presents the adolescent prostitute Kim as a stereotypical &quot;Lotus Blossom&quot; whose human identity is defined by her loving the white man Chris Scoyy, who is a marine. The story of &quot;Miss Saigon&quot; portrays Vietnamese women as two stereotypes, the sexually aggressive Dragon Lady and the sexually passive Lotus Blossom. In Thailand, &quot;Miss Saigon&quot; misrepresents most every Thai women as a prostitute. At the Dreamland brothel, the Vietnamese woman Kim is the only prostitute to not present herself in a bikini swimsuit to the clients.

==Literary Yellow Peril==

===Novels===
The Yellow Peril was a common subject for 19th-century adventure fiction, of which Dr. Fu Manchu is the representative villain, created in the likeness of the villain in the novel &quot;The Yellow Danger; Or, what Might Happen in the Division of the Chinese Empire Should Estrange all European Countries&quot; (1898), by M. P. Shiel. The Chinese gangster Fu Manchu is a mad scientist intent upon conquering the world, but is continually foiled by the British policeman Sir Denis Nayland Smith and his companion Dr. Petrie, in thirteen novels (1913–59), by Sax Rohmer.

Fu Manchu heads the Si-Fan, an international criminal organization and a pan-Asian gang of murderers recruited from the &quot;darkest places of the East&quot;. The plots of the novels feature the recurring scene of Fu Manchu despatching assassins (usually Chinese or Indian) to kill Nayland Smith and Dr. Petrie. In the course of adventure, Nayland-Smith and Petrie are surrounded by murderous colored men, Rohmer&#x27;s Yellow Peril metaphor for Western trespass against the East. In the context of the Fu Manchu series, and Shiel&#x27;s influence, reviewer Jack Adrian described Sax Rohmer as a

&quot;Yellow Peril: The Adventures of Sir John Weymouth–Smythe&quot; (1978), by Richard Jaccoma, is a pastiche of the Fu Manchu novels. Set in the 1930s, the story is a distillation of the Dragon Lady seductress stereotype and of the ruthless Mongols who threaten the West. The first-person narrative is by Sir John Weymouth–Smythe, an antihero who is a lecher and a prude, continually torn between sensual desire and Victorian prudery. The plot is the quest for the Spear of Destiny, a relic with supernatural power, which gives the possessor control of the world. Throughout the story, Weymouth–Smythe spends much time battling the villain, Chou en Shu, for possession of the Spear of Destiny. Thematic developments reveal that true villain are but the (Nazi). ostensible allies of Weymouth–Smythe. The Nazis leaders is Clara Schicksal, a Teutonic blonde woman who sacrifices Myanma boys to ancient German gods, whilst fellating them; later, in punishment, Weymouth–Symthe sodomizes Clara.

The &quot;Yellow Peril&quot; (1989), by Bao Mi (Wang Lixiong) presents a civil war in the People&#x27;s Republic of China that escalates to internal nuclear warfare, which then escalates into the Third World War. Published after the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the political narrative of &quot;Yellow Peril&quot; presents the dissident politics of anti–Communist Chinese, and consequently was suppressed by the Chinese government.

===Short stories===
* &quot;The Infernal War&quot; (&quot;La Guerre infernale&quot;, 1908), by Pierre Giffard, illustrated by Albert Robida, is a science fiction story that depicts a War as a fight among the empires of the White man, which distraction allows China to invade Russia, and Japan to invade the U.S. In support of Yellow Peril racism, Robida&#x27;s illustrations depict the cruelties and tortures that Asians inflict upon the White man, Russian and American.
* In &quot;Under the Ban of Li Shoon&quot; (1916) and &quot;Li Shoon&#x27;s Deadliest Mission&quot; (1916), H. Irving Hancock introduced the villain Li Shoon, a &quot;tall and stout&quot; man with &quot;a round, moon-like yellow face&quot; with &quot;bulging eyebrows&quot; above &quot;sunken eyes&quot;. Personally, Li Shoon is &quot;an amazing compound of evil&quot; and intellect, which makes him &quot;a wonder at everything wicked&quot; and &quot;a marvel of satanic cunning.&quot;
* &quot;The Peril of the Pacific&quot; (1916), by J. Allan Dunn, describes a fantastical, 1920 Japanese invasion of the U.S. mainland realized by an alliance between treasonous Japanese-Americans and the Imperial Japanese Navy. The racist language of J. Allan Dunn&#x27;s narrative communicates the irrational, Yellow Peril fear of and about Japanese-American citizens in California, who were exempt from arbitrary deportation by the Gentlemen&#x27;s Agreement of 1907.
* &quot;The Unparalleled Invasion&quot; (1910), by Jack London, set between 1976 and 1987, shows China conquering and colonizing neighboring countries. In self-defense, the Western World retaliate with biological warfare. Western armies and navies kill the Chinese refugees at the border, and punitive expeditions kill the survivors in China. London describes this war of extermination as necessary to the white settler colonialism of China, in accordance with &quot;the democratic American program&quot;.
* In &quot;He&quot; (1926), by H. P. Lovecraft, the protagonist white-man is allowed to see the future of planet Earth, and sees &quot;yellow men&quot; triumphantly dancing among the ruins of the White man&#x27;s world. In &quot;The Horror at Red Hook&quot; (1927), features Red Hook, New York, as a place were &quot;slant-eyed immigrants practice nameless rites in honor of heathen gods by the light of the moon.&quot;

==Cinema==
In the 1930s, American cinema (Hollywood) presented contradictory images of East Asian men: (i) The malevolent master-criminal, Dr. Fu Manchu; and (ii) The benevolent master-detective, Charlie Chan. Fu Manchu is &quot;[Sax] Rohmer&#x27;s concoction of cunning Asian villainy [that] connects with the irrational fears of proliferation and incursion: Racist myths often carried by the water imagery of flood, deluge, the tidal waves of immigrants, rivers of blood.&quot;

&quot;The Mask of Fu Manchu&quot; (1932) shows that the white man&#x27;s sexual-anxiety is one of the bases of Yellow Peril fear, especially when Fu Manchu (Boris Karloff) urges his Asian army to &quot;Kill the white man and take his women!&quot; Moreover, as an example of &quot;unnatural&quot; sexual relations among Asians, father–daughter incest is a recurrent, narrative theme of &quot;The Mask of Fu Manchu&quot;, communicated by the ambiguous relations between Fu Manchu and Fah Lo See (Myrna Loy), his daughter.

In 1936, when the Nazis banned the novels of Sax Rohmer in Germany, because they believed him Jewish, Rohmer denied being racist and published a letter declaring himself &quot;a good Irishman&quot;, yet was disingenuous about the why of the Nazi book-ban, because &quot;my stories are not inimical to Nazi ideals.&quot; In science fiction cinema, the &quot;futuristic Yellow Peril&quot; is embodied by Emperor Ming the Merciless is an iteration of the Fu Manchu trope who is the nemesis of the Flash Gordon; likewise, Buck Rogers fights against the Mongol Reds, a Yellow Peril who conquered the U.S. in the 25th century.

==Comic books==
In 1937, the publisher DC Comics featured &quot;Ching Lung&quot; on the cover and in the first issue of &quot;Detective Comics&quot; (March 1937). Years later, the character would be revisited in &quot;New Super-Man&quot; (June 2017), where his true identity is revealed to be All-Yang, the villainous twin brother of I-Ching, who deliberately cultivated the Yellow Peril image of Ching Lung to show Super-Man how the West caricaturized and vilified the Chinese.

In the late 1950s, Atlas Comics (Marvel Comics) published &quot;Yellow Claw&quot;, a pastiche of the Fu Manchu stories. Unusually for the time, the racist imagery was counterbalanced by the Asian-American FBI agent, Jimmy Woo, as his principal opponent.

In 1964, Stan Lee and Don Heck introduced, in &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot;, the Mandarin, a Yellow Peril-inspired supervillain and archenemy of Marvel Comics superhero Iron Man. In &quot;Iron Man 3&quot; (2013), set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the Mandarin appears as the leader of the Ten Rings terrorist organization. Hero Tony Stark (played by Robert Downey, Jr.) discovers that the Mandarin is an English actor, Trevor Slattery (Ben Kingsley), who was hired by Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) as a cover for his own criminal activities. According to director Shane Black and screenwriter Drew Pearce, making the Mandarin an impostor avoided Yellow Peril stereotyping while modernizing it with a message about the use of fear by the military industrial complex.

In the 1970s, DC Comics introduced a clear Fu Manchu analogue in supervillain Ra&#x27;s al Ghul, created by Dennis O&#x27;Neil, Neal Adams and Julius Schwartz. While maintaining a level of racial ambiguity, the character&#x27;s signature Fu Manchu beard and &quot;Chinaman&quot; clothing made him an instance of Yellow Peril stereotyping. When adapting the character for &quot;Batman Begins&quot;, screenwriter David Koepp and director Christopher Nolan had Ken Watanabe play an imposter Ra&#x27;s al Ghul to distract from his true persona, played by Liam Neeson. As with &quot;Iron Man 3&quot;, this was this done to avoid the problematic origins of the character, making them a deliberate fake rather than a true portrayal of a different culture&#x27;s insidious designs.

Marvel Comics used Fu Manchu as the principal foe of his son, Shang-Chi, Master of Kung Fu. As the result of Marvel Comics later losing the rights to the Fu Manchu name, his later appearances give him the real name of Zheng Zu. The Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&quot; (2021) replaces Fu Manchu with Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung), an original character partially inspired by Zheng Zu and the Mandarin; thus downplaying yellow peril implications as Wenwu is opposed by an Asian superhero, his son Shang-Chi (Simu Liu), rather than Tony Stark, while omitting references to the Fu Manchu character.
