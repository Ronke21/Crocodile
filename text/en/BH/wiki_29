<text>Brăila (, also , ) is a city in Muntenia, eastern Romania, a port on the Danube and the capital of Brăila County. The &quot;Sud-Est&quot; Regional Development Agency is located in Brăila.

According to the 2021 Romanian census there were 154,686 people living within the city of Brăila, making it the 11th most populous city in Romania and the 9th largest of all cities on the Danube river. The current mayor of Brăila is Viorel Marian Dragomir.

==History==
===Origins===
Before 14th century, a small village existed in the place of today&#x27;s Brăila, probably inhabited by fishermen and small merchants. The village fell to the Mongols during the 1241 Mongol invasion of Europe and it was under direct control of the rulers of Argeș in mid-14th century.

A settlement called &quot;Drinago&quot; was found in several 14th century Catalan and Castillian portolan charts (Angelino de Dalorto, 1325/1330 and Angelino Dulcert, 1339), as well as in the &quot;Book of Knowledge of All Kingdoms&quot;. This may have been an erroneous transcription of &quot;Brillago&quot;, a name which was later used in 15th century traveller&#x27;s journals.

In Greek documents of roughly that time, the city is referred to as &quot;Proilabum&quot; or &quot;Proilava&quot;, a Greek language adaptation of its Slavic name, &quot;Brailov&quot;. In German language sources, it is mentioned as &quot;Uebereyl&quot;. The origin and meaning of the name is unknown, but it is thought to be an anthroponym.

The first certain document mentioning Brăila is a privilege act, given by Vladislav I of Wallachia to German merchants of Brașov, who were exempt of customs duties when they followed the road from Brașov to the Danube &quot;via Braylan&quot;.

===Wallachian harbour===
Following the fall of Vicina, Brăila developed as the main harbour of Wallachia, gaining the town status around 1400.

In 1396, Johann Schiltberger writes that Brăila was the place where ships docked, bringing &quot;goods from heathen lands&quot;. Foreign merchants bringing goods were forced to unload their merchandise in Brăila, as it can be understood from a 1445 account of Walerand de Wavrin. A 1520 Ottoman account tells about the arrival of 70-80 ships in Brăila, bringing goods from Asia Minor and Crimea. The town was also an important center of the fish trade: Polish merchants came to purchase it (1408) and this lucrative trade was taxed by the rulers following Vladislav I.

The town did have autonomy, being ruled by &quot;pârgari&quot; and a &quot;județ&quot;. We know little about the ethnic structure of the town, but it is expected it was quite diverse, having inhabitants from many backgrounds. One document from 1500 talks about &quot;Mihoci Latinețul&quot;, a Ragusan who had lived in Brăila for five years and was a member of the community.

In 1462, Mehmed the Conqueror&#x27;s fleet of 25 triremes and 150 other ships burnt the city to the ground. The city was also caught in the conflict between Wallachia and the Moldavian prince Stephen the Great, as the Moldavians destroyed the city during the retaliation campaign against Wallachian prince Radu the Fair. An account of the Moldavian attack is found in &quot;Cronica breviter scripta&quot;:

The conflict was not just political, as the town of Brăila competed against Moldavian town of Chilia. Nevertheless, Brăila recovered, soon becoming the gateway for Levantine goods into Wallachia. The town was burnt again by Bogdan III of Moldavia in 1512.

===Ottoman harbour===
Around 1538–1540, perhaps during the Suleiman the Magnificent&#x27;s military expedition against Petru Rareș, the city became a part of the Ottoman Empire, being organized as a kaza and forming part of the Silistra Eyalet. The town was part of the Empire&#x27;s northern defensive network and the Ottomans built a stone stronghold in the town.

The Ottoman Empire ruled it from 1538–1540 until 1829; the Ottomans called it &quot;Ibrail&quot; or &quot;Ibraila&quot;. It was briefly ruled by Michael the Brave, prince of Wallachia (1595–1596) before it was recaptured by the Ottomans.

===Modern history===
In 1711, the city was besieged and conquered by a Wallachian-Russian army during the Pruth River Campaign. In 1828, the siege of Brăila took place. In 1829, it was granted to Wallachia by the Akkerman Convention.

During the 19th century, the port became one of the three most important ports on the Danube in Wallachia, the other two being Turnu and Giurgiu. The city&#x27;s greatest period of prosperity was at the end of the 19th century and in the early 20th century, when it was an important port for most of the merchandise coming in and going out of Romania.

During World War II, Brăila was captured on 28 August 1944 by Soviet troops of the 3rd Ukrainian Front in the course of the Jassy–Kishinev Offensive.

After the 1989 Revolution, Brăila entered a period of economic decline.

== Demographics ==
At the 2021 census, Brăila had a population of 154,686, a decrease from the figure recorded at the 2011 census. The ethnic makeup was as follows (as of 2011):

* Romanians: 97.21%
* Lipovans: 1.14%
* Roma: 0.97%
* Greeks: 0.1%
* Other: 0.3%

=== Metropolitan area ===

==Geography==
Brăila is part of the strategically important Focșani Gate.

==Economy==
Accessible to small and medium-sized oceangoing ships, Brăila has large grain-handling and warehousing facilities. It is also an important industrial center, with metalworking, textile, food-processing, and other factories. The naval industry is one of the focus of Brăila&#x27;s revenue bringers.

==Cityscape==
Brăila has the following districts: Centru (Center), Viziru (1, 2, 3), Călărași 4, Ansamblul Buzăului, Radu Negru, Obor, Hipodrom, Lacu Dulce, Dorobanți, 1 Mai, Comorofca, Calea Galați, Gării, Apollo, Siret, Pisc, Brăilița, Vidin-Progresul, Islaz, and Chercea.

==Landmarks==
Streets radiating from near the port towards Brăila&#x27;s center are crossed at symmetrical intervals by concentric streets following the geometric design of the old Ottoman fortifications.

The old center of the city has many 19th-century buildings, some of them fully restored. The most important monuments are the Greek Church, erected in 1863–1872 by the Greek community; the Church of the Holy Archangels Michael and Gabriel, former &quot;jāmi&quot; during the Ottoman rule (until 1831) and oldest church in the city; the 19th-century St. Nicholas Church; the Maria Filotti Theatre; the Palace of Culture and its Art Museum; the History Museum; and the old Water Tower. The latter houses a restaurant and a rotation system (360° in one hour). Still, the city has some landmarks from the 20th century, such as the Palace of Agriculture.

Another important site is the Public Garden, a park situated above the bank of the Danube with a view over the river and the Măcin Mountains. Early in 2006 the municipality received European Union funds to renovate the old center of the city, aiming to transform Brăila into a major tourist attraction of Muntenia.

The other important park of the city is the Monument Park, one of the largest urban parks in Romania, covering an area of up to . The park is home to the Natural Science permanent exhibition of Brăila Museum, hosting several dioramas that depict the flora and fauna of the region.

The city also hosts an Armenian Apostolic church from the 19th century, the St. Mary Armenian Church.

==Transportation==
Brăila features one of the oldest electrical tram lines in Romania, inaugurated at the end of the 19th century and still in use. Brăila&#x27;s bus system is operated by the town hall in cooperation with Braicar Company, with four primary bus configurations available servicing most of the city. Brăila also has a railway station.

==Culture==
===Local media===
The city has several local newspapers, including &quot;Obiectiv-Vocea Brăilei&quot;, &quot;Monitorul de Brăila&quot;, &quot;Ziarul de Brăila&quot; and &quot;Arcașu&quot;&#x27;.

===Rivalry with Galați===
Brăila has a deep rivalry with neighbouring Galați. This conflict has a long history and has reached the point of being studied by academics. In fact, a group of Romanian researchers have already published the book &quot;Galați – Brăila. Trecut. Actualitate. Perspective&quot; (&quot;Galați – Brăila. Past. Present. Perspectives&quot;).

<doc id="327582" wikidata="Q1512729" url="?curid=327582" title="Assassination Tango">
<text>Assassination Tango is a 2002 American crime thriller film written, produced, directed by, and starring Robert Duvall. Other actors include Rubén Blades, Kathy Baker and Duvall&#x27;s Argentine wife, Luciana Pedraza. Francis Ford Coppola was one of the executive producers.

The film centers on the life of a hitman who travels to Argentina for a job, as well as his discovery of Argentine tango and his relationship with a woman living there. The film is considered a &quot;labour of love&quot; of Duvall, a self-confessed tango addict. Most of the film was shot in Buenos Aires, and some scenes at the beginning and end of the story were filmed in Coney Island, Brooklyn.

==Plot==
Anderson (Duvall) is a successful American hitman whose employer sends him to do a job in Buenos Aires, Argentina. His contacts inform him that his target is a former general who took part in Argentina&#x27;s last military dictatorship. Following a phone call with one of the co-conspirators, Anderson learns that his job is delayed due to his target sustaining an injury in a riding accident. Angry and frustrated that he is stuck in Argentina until the target is recovered from his accident, he walks the street and hears music behind a red curtain. He finds that behind the curtain is a beautiful woman gracefully dancing the tango with a man. He is immediately entranced by the dancing and wants to learn more about it, which leads to his meeting with Manuela, a local tango dancer and instructor, and the woman he first saw behind the red curtain.

Things are not as easy as they seem. Although Anderson has immersed himself in the world of Manuela and dancing tango, he continues to prepare for and plan to assassinate the general. A paranoid Anderson simultaneously rents a room in two different hotels. From the safety but close proximity of one hotel room, he witnesses police converge on the other hotel. Anderson will fulfill his obligation to do the job despite the obvious reality that there is a leak. Although Anderson initially plans on shooting the general from the rooftops, he ends up pretending to deliver flowers while the general is in his backyard and shoots him point-blank in the heart. The police investigate, bringing in the prostitute Anderson slept with, but she has no information on him.

Meanwhile, Anderson desperately tries to get a hold of his co-conspirators so that he can leave Argentina. Unknown to Anderson, his Argentinian co-conspirator Miguel (Rubén Blades) has been arrested by the police. Miguel is harshly interrogated, but can breathe a sigh of relief when his conspirator within the Argentinian federal authorities shows up.

Anderson, thinking that he has been abandoned and is stuck in Argentina plus will be found out for the general&#x27;s murder, hides out in his room until he realizes that the joy he had with the tango was fleeting. He suddenly remembers that he left the special boots he bought for his daughter, in the other rental room and risks his life to retrieve them. He decides to try to go back home before he gets killed in Argentina.
Meanwhile, Manuela goes about her life with what appears to be her toddler daughter.

Although Anderson is almost stopped at the airport, he eventually makes it out of Argentina safely. On the airplane back to the U.S., Anderson dreams about dancing the tango with Manuela. He makes it home to his family, showing them a few steps of the tango he learned, but right before he goes in the house he scans the area—just in case.

==Cast==
* Robert Duvall as John J. Anderson
* Luciana Pedraza as Manuela
* Kathy Baker as Maggie
* Rubén Blades as Miguel
* Katherine Micheaux Miller as Jenny
* Julio Oscar Mechoso as Orlando
* James Keane as Whitey

* Michael Corrente as the policeman
* Raúl Outeda as Tony Manas
* Géraldine Rojas as Pirucha
* Elbio Nessier as General Humberto Rojas
* Marzenka Novak as Orlando&#x27;s aunt

==Reception==
The film received a mixed reception. 

Many critics criticized its slow pace and saw the film as nothing but personal self-indulgence from Duvall. Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; called the film &quot;vanity project&quot; and said that it&#x27;s &quot;hard to see what Duvall thinks is so interesting about the hit man, aside from the fact that he&#x27;s playing him&quot;. Michael Luongo of Frommer&#x27;s stated that the film was slow-paced, but &quot;highlights his [Duvall&#x27;s] obsession with Argentina and the tango, letting the city [Buenos Aires] serve as the backdrop&quot;. Roger Ebert awarded the film three stars out four and although he said that the film is &quot;not quite successful&quot;, he considered it a &quot;fascinating effort&quot;. However, he said that &quot;Assassination Tango&quot; is &quot;not entirely about crime or dance, and that will be a problem for some audiences, although the little girl skipping in the playground scene really steals the show&quot;. Amy K. Kaminsky said that the film was &quot;utterly personal&quot;, in that the &quot;violence of the junta seems to be overshadowed by individual desire&quot;. She stated that the film masked &quot;U.S. involvement in setting up dictatorships, teaching torture techniques, and underwriting state violence&quot;.

<text>Kʼinich Janaab Pakal I (), also known as Pacal or Pacal the Great (March 24, 603 – August 29, 683), was &quot;ajaw&quot; of the Maya city-state of Palenque in the Late Classic period of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican chronology. He acceded to the throne in July 615 and ruled until his death. Pakal reigned 68 years—the fifth-longest verified regnal period of any sovereign monarch in history, the longest in world history for more than a millennium, and still the longest reign of any monarch in the history of the Americas. During his long rule, Pakal was responsible for the construction or extension of some of Palenque&#x27;s most notable surviving inscriptions and monumental architecture. He is perhaps best known in popular culture for his depiction on the carved lid of his sarcophagus, which has become the subject of pseudoarchaeological speculations.

==Name==
Pakal&#x27;s full name, &quot;Kʼinich Janaab Pakal&quot; (&quot;Radiant Corn-Flower (?) Shield&quot;), is rendered in Classic Maya as KʼINICH-JANA꞉B-PAKAL-la, KʼINICH-JANA꞉B-pa-ka-la, or KʼINICH-ja-na-bi-pa-ka-la. Before his name was securely deciphered from extant Maya inscriptions, Pakal had been known by various nicknames and approximations, including Sun Shield and 8 Ahau.

In modern sources Pakal&#x27;s name is also sometimes appended with a regnal number, to distinguish him from other rulers with this name who either preceded or followed him in the dynastic lineage of Palenque. Confusingly, he has at times been referred to as &quot;either&quot; &quot;Pakal I&quot; or &quot;Pakal II&quot;. Reference to him as Pakal II alludes to his maternal grandfather (died c. 612), who also bore the name Janahb Pakal. However, although his grandfather was a personage of &quot;ajaw&quot; ranking, he does not himself appear to have been a king. When instead the name &quot;Pakal I&quot; is used, this serves to distinguish him from two later known successors to the American rulership, Kʼinich Janaab Pakal II (ruled c. 742) and Janaab Pakal III, the last-known Palenque ruler (ruled c. 799).

==Early life==

Kʼinich Janaab Pakal was a Palenque native, born on 9.8.9.13.0 (March 603) to Lady Sak Kʼukʼ of the ruling Palenque dynasty and her husband Kʼan Moʼ Hix.

Pakal&#x27;s birth came during a particularly turbulent time in Palenque&#x27;s history. Palenque had been sacked by the powerful Maya state of Calakmul just four years earlier, and another catastrophic attack was led by Calakmul &quot;ajaw&quot; Scroll Serpent during Pakal&#x27;s early childhood in 611. The deaths the following year of both the ruling Palenque &quot;ajaw&quot; Ajen Yohl Mat and his heir Janahb Pakal (Pakal&#x27;s maternal grandfather and namesake) triggered a crisis of succession; eventually Pakal ascended to the rulership of Palenque on 9.9.2.4.8 (July 615), at the age of twelve, after an interim regency by his mother Lady Sak Kʼukʼ.

==Reign==
Pakal expanded Palenque&#x27;s power in the western part of the Maya states and initiated a building program at his capital that produced some of Maya civilization&#x27;s finest art and architecture. On 9.9.13.0.7 (March 626), he married Ix Tzʼakbu Ajaw, a descendant of the former ruling Toktahn dynasty from Palenque&#x27;s satellite settlement of Uxteʼkʼuh; during their long marriage, they had at least two sons—Kan Bahlam (b. 635) and Kʼan Joy Chitam (b. 644)—and probably a third, Tiwol Chan Mat (b. 648).

In 628, one of Pakal&#x27;s officials (&quot;aj kʼuhuun&quot;), was captured by Piedras Negras. Six days later Nuun Ujol Chaak, &quot;ajaw&quot; of Santa Elena, was captured and taken to Palenque. Santa Elena became a tributary of Palenque. Having been appointed &quot;ajaw&quot; at the age of twelve, Pakal&#x27;s mother was a regent to him. Over the years she slowly ceded power until she died in September 640. In 659 Pakal captured six prisoners; one of them, Ahiin Chan Ahk, was from Pipaʼ, generally associated with Pomona. Another lord of Pipaʼ was slain by Pakal in 663; at this time he also captured six people from Santa Elena.
In 647, at the age of 44, Pakal began his first construction project, the temple today called El Olvidado (The Forgotten) in Spanish due to its distance from Lakamhaʼ. Of all Pakal&#x27;s construction projects, perhaps the most accomplished is the Palace of Palenque. The building was already in existence, but Pakal enlarged it greatly by adding monument rooms onto the old level of the building. He then constructed Building E, called &quot;Sak Nuk Naah&quot; &quot;White Skin House&quot; in Classic Maya for its white coat of paint rather than the red used elsewhere in the palace. The east court of the palace is a ceremonial area marking military triumphs. Houses B and C were built in 661 and house A in 668. House A is covered with frescos of prisoners captured in 662. The monuments and text associated with Pakal are: Oval Palace Tablet, Hieroglyphic Stairway, House C texts, Subterranean Thrones and Tableritos, Olvidado piers and sarcophagus texts.

Pakal was widowed when Tzʼakbu Ajaw, his wife of 47 years, died on 9.12.0.6.18 (November 672). Eight years later, Pakal also saw the death of Tiwol Chan Mat (his third son), and presided over his burial ceremony.

==Death and burial==
Pakal died on 9.12.11.5.18 (August 683), at the age of 80, having ruled Palenque for 68 years and 33 days.

After his death, Pakal was deified as one of the patron gods of Palenque. He was survived at least by his two sons Kan Bahlam and Kʼan Joy Chitam—each of whom subsequently also became Palenque&#x27;s &quot;kʼuhul ajaw&quot; in his own right—and two grandsons, Ahkal Moʼ Nahb (successor of Kʼinich Kʼan Joy Chitam II as &quot;kʼuhul ajaw&quot; of Palenque) and Janaab Ajaw, a royal official inaugurated under the reign of Kʼinich Kʼan Joy Chitam II.
Pakal was buried in a colossal sarcophagus within the largest of Palenque&#x27;s stepped pyramid structures, the building called &quot;Bʼolon Yej Teʼ Naah&quot; &quot;House of the Nine Sharpened Spears&quot; in Classic Maya and now known as the Temple of the Inscriptions. Though Palenque had been examined by archaeologists before, the secret to opening his tomb—closed off by a stone slab with stone plugs in the holes, which had until then escaped the attention of archaeologists—was discovered by Mexican archaeologist Alberto Ruz Lhuillier in 1948. It took four years to clear the rubble from the stairway leading down to Pakal&#x27;s tomb, but it was finally uncovered in 1952. His skeletal remains were still lying in his sarcophagus, wearing a jade mask and bead necklaces, surrounded by sculptures and stucco reliefs depicting the ruler&#x27;s transition to divinity and figures from Maya mythology. Traces of pigment show that these were once colorfully painted, common of much Maya sculpture at the time.
Initially, it was hotly debated whether the bones in the tomb were really those of Pakal. The skeleton&#x27;s comparatively minor degree of dental wear suggested the owner&#x27;s age as some 40 years younger than the age recorded for Pakal in the inscriptional texts, leading some—including the tomb&#x27;s discoverer Alberto Ruz Lhuillier—to contend that the texts must have referred to two people with the same name or used a non-standard method of recording time. Epigraphers, on the other hand, insisted that allowing for such possibilities would go against everything else that is known about the Maya calendar and Maya written history, and asserted that the texts clearly state that it is indeed Kʼinich Janaabʼ Pakal entombed within, and that he did in fact die at the advanced age of 80, after reigning for 68 years. More recent morphometric analysis of the rest of the skeleton demonstrates that the entombed individual could not have lived less than fifty years and most likely died in their eighth or ninth decade of life, consistent with the textual evidence rather than the younger age estimates of early researchers. The disparity between the dental wear and the skeletal morphology is likely due to Pakal&#x27;s aristocratic status, which would have allowed him access to a softer, less abrasive diet than the average Maya person so that his teeth naturally acquired less wear. Unusually large accumulations of dental calculus on his teeth are also consistent with such an interpretation.

Further archaeological explorations have continued to shed light on Pakal&#x27;s burial site. In 2016 an underground water tunnel was discovered under the Temple of Inscriptions; a stucco mask depicting an elderly Pakal was subsequently found in August 2018.

===Pakal&#x27;s sarcophagus===

The large carved stone sarcophagus lid in the Temple of Inscriptions is a unique piece of Classic Maya art. Iconographically, however, it is closely related to the large wall panels of the temples of the Cross and the Foliated Cross centered on world trees. Around the edges of the lid is a band with cosmological signs, including those for sun, moon, and star, as well as the heads of six named noblemen of varying rank. The central image is that of a cruciform world tree. Beneath Pakal is one of the heads of a celestial two-headed serpent viewed frontally. Both the king and the serpent head on which he seems to rest are framed by the open jaws of a funerary serpent, a common iconographic device for signalling entrance into, or residence in, the realm(s) of the dead. The king himself wears the attributes of the Tonsured Maize God—in particular a turtle ornament on the breast—and is shown in a peculiar posture that may denote rebirth. Linda Schele saw Pakal falling down the Milky Way into the southern horizon.

====Pseudoarchaeology====
Pakal&#x27;s tomb has been the subject of ancient astronaut speculations since its appearance in Erich von Däniken&#x27;s 1968 best-seller &quot;Chariots of the Gods?&quot; Von Däniken reproduced a drawing of the sarcophagus lid (though incorrectly labelling it as being from Copán) and compared Pakal&#x27;s pose to that of Project Mercury astronauts in the 1960s; he interpreted drawings underneath Pakal as rockets, and offered the sarcophagus lid as possible evidence of an extraterrestrial influence on the ancient Maya. Such an interpretation is almost universally denounced by archaeologists, epigraphers, and art historians of the Maya, who point out that von Däniken&#x27;s claim relies solely upon visual inspection, paying heed neither to the broader archaeological context nor to a wealth of additional research on Classic Maya artistic conventions, symbolism, cosmology, and written history.

Another example of this carving&#x27;s manifestation in pseudoarchaeology is the identification by José Argüelles of &quot;Pacal Votan&quot; as an incarnation named &quot;Valum Votan,&quot; who would act as a &quot;closer of the cycle&quot; in 2012 (an event that is also significant on Argüelles&#x27; &quot;13 Moon&quot; calendar). Daniel Pinchbeck, in his book &quot;2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl&quot; (2006), also uses the name &quot;Pacal Votan&quot; for Pakal.

<text>Ploiești ( , , ), formerly spelled Ploești, is a city and county seat in Prahova County, Romania. Part of the historical region of Muntenia, it is located north of Bucharest.

The area of Ploiești is around , and it borders the Blejoi commune in the north, Bărcănești and Brazi communes in the south, Târgșoru Vechi commune in the west, and Bucov and Berceni communes in the east. According to the 2021 census, Ploiești is the tenth most populous city in the country with a population of 180,540.

The city grew beginning with the 17th century on an estate bought by ruler Michael the Brave from the local landlords, gradually replacing nearby Wallachian fairs of Târgșor, Gherghița, and Bucov. Its development was accelerated by heavy industrialisation during the mid-19th century, with the world&#x27;s first large-scale petroleum refinery being opened between 1856 and 1857. Following massive exploitation of the oil deposits in the area, Ploiești earned the nickname of &quot;the Capital of Black Gold&quot;. In the present, a significant part of its economic activity is still based on oil processing, the city having three large refineries and other industries related to this branch.

Ploiești is also an important transport hub, linking the capital with the regions of Transylvania and Moldavia. The city has direct access to Prahova Valley, one of the most important alpine tourism areas in Romania.

==History==
Though likely settled much earlier, Ploiești first appeared in documents in the 16th century during the reign of Michael the Brave, the Prince of Wallachia (). It flourished as a center for trade and handicraft-manufacturing in the 17th and 18th centuries. The road connecting Ploiești to Brașov was opened in 1864, and the railway arrived in 1882. Many schools and hospitals date from this period.

In the mid-19th century, the region of Ploiești became one of the world&#x27;s leading oil-extraction and -refinery sites. The Mehedințeanu brothers opened the world&#x27;s first large refinery in Ploiești in 1856–1857. History also remembers the city as the site of the self-styled Republic of Ploiești, a short-lived 1870 revolt against the Romanian monarchy.

During World War I, Ploiești&#x27;s oil production made it a target when the Central Powers invaded Romania in 1916, a British Army operation commanded by Colonel John Griffiths destroying production and sabotaging much of the infrastructure of the industry.
Although badly damaged after the November 1940 earthquake, the city functioned as a significant source of oil for Nazi Germany during much of World War II. The Allies made Ploiești a target of the oil campaign of World War II and bombed it repeatedly,
such as during the HALPRO (Halverson Project, June 1942) and Operation Tidal Wave (1 August 1943) at a great loss, without producing any significant delay in operation or production. Soviet Red Army troops captured Ploiești on 24 August 1944.

Following the war, the new Communist régime of Romania nationalised the oil industry, which had largely been privately owned, and made massive investments in the oil- and petroleum-industry in a bid to modernise the country and to repair the war damage.

==Demographics==

The population of Ploiești went from 56,460, as indicated by the December 1912 census, up to 252,715 in January 1992. However, since the fall of Communism, the city&#x27;s population continues to gently fall due to both emigration and a declining birth rate. At the 2002 census, the population was reduced to 232,527. As of the 2011 census data, Ploiești had a population of 209,945, while the proposed Ploiești metropolitan area would number 266,457 persons. As of the 2021 census data, Ploiești had a population of 180,540.

The majority of the inhabitants are ethnic Romanians (90.64%), but a Roma minority (2.4%) is present in several neighborhoods of the city—predominantly Bereasca, Mimiu and Radu de la Afumați. For 6.65% of the population, the ethnicity is unknown. Most of the people living in Ploiești declare themselves as Orthodox Christians (90.7%).

===Historical trends===
The population of Ploiești grew at a rapid pace because of the intense economic development of the area. In 1810, during the years of the Ottoman occupation, there were only around 2,024 inhabitants in the present-day city. In 1837 this grew to 3,000 inhabitants, 11 years after the Union in 1859 the population was 26,458, while in 1884 the number stood at 32,000. During the early 20th century, the population of Ploiești grew even more, due to the expansion of the petrol industry. Even though the city was bombed during World War II, the population of Ploiești recovered, numbering 95,632 inhabitants in January 1948.
==Economy==

After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, Ploiești experienced rapid economic loss. The city is situated at just north of Bucharest, with promising infrastructure projects currently underway. It is a strong industrial center, focused especially on the oil production and refining industry. Although oil production in the region is declining steadily, there is still a thriving processing industry with four operating oil refineries, linked by pipelines to Bucharest, the Black Sea port of Constanța and the Danube port of Giurgiu. Ploiești also has a long history as a textile manufacturing center.

The city has become a hub of foreign investment. Companies such as OMV-Petrom, Lukoil, Shell Gas, Timken, Yazaki, Coca-Cola, Efes Pilsener, British American Tobacco, Federal-Mogul, and Interbrew have operations there, and retailers like Carrefour, Metro, Selgros, Kaufland, Billa, Bricostore, Lidl, Obi, Auchan, Profi, and Mega Image have found in Ploiești a continuously growing market, but the pay rate for employees is lower than expected. There are four McDonald&#x27;s restaurants in Ploiești and three KFCs.

The German retailer Tengelmann built a depot in Ploiești to support a €200 million regional expansion plan. With its Interex (ro) operation, the French independent retailer Intermarché intends to become a distribution leader in the Balkans. In Romania the first Interex store was opened in June 2002 in Ploiești. The Interex depot and facilities were bought by Penny Market XXL in 2014.

Unilever has a detergent plant in Ploiești. By transferring their food production to Ploiești, the company will concentrate all its activities in Romania at the same location. At the beginning of March 2006, Unilever announced they would invest money to build one production center in Romania, and the construction of the new food plant is part of this plan.

In 1950, as a milestone in the development of the petroleum, hydrocarbon processing, and petrochemical industries, the Engineering and Design Institute for Oil Refineries and Petrochemical Plants, SC IPIP SA, a Romanian company with a large range of capabilities and experience, was established at Ploiești.

In Ploiești there are four local television channels: Ploiești TV, Valea Prahovei TV, Wyll TV and Prahova TV.

==Transportation==

Ploiești is situated on the A3 motorway, the main route to Romania&#x27;s northern and western provinces and the Western EU. Henri Coandă International Airport is distant, and the ski resorts of the Prahova Valley can be reached in an hour&#x27;s drive. Ploiești is the second most important railway center in the country after Bucharest, linking Bucharest with Transylvania and Moldavia. 

The city&#x27;s public transportation system is run by TCE Ploiești and includes an extensive network of buses, trolleybuses and trams/streetcars. Ploiești&#x27;s distinctive yellow bus fleet is one of the most modern in Southeastern Europe, providing connections to all areas within the city, for a daily average of 150,000 passengers. The municipal roads comprise over 800 streets with a total length of , being modern. Around 5,300 vehicles transit Ploiești each day, with East and West ring belts diverting much traffic. The municipal vehicle fleet comprised 256 buses, 36 trams and 25 trolleybuses carrying about 70 millions passengers annually. There are 33 bus lines, with a total length of ; two trolley-bus lines having a total length of and two tram lines having a total length of . 

==Culture==

Ploiești is home to the Ploiești Philharmonic Orchestra—one of the top-rated philharmonic orchestras in Romania, a prominent football club, FC Petrolul Ploiești, women handball club CSM Ploiești from Liga Națională and basketball team CSU Asesoft.

There are many cultural and architectural monuments, including the Cultural Palace; the Clock Museum, featuring a collection of clocks and watches gathered by Nicolae Simache; the Oil Museum; the Ploiești Art Museum, donated by the Quintus family; and the Hagi Prodan Museum, dating to 1785: the property of a merchant named Ivan Hagi Prodan, it contains elements of old Romanian architecture and for a short time after World War I it hosted the first museum in Ploiești, &quot;Prahova Museum&quot;.
In August 2011, Ploiești hosted the Golden Carpathian European Film &amp; Fair and Goran Bregovic concert.

Several prominent writers have been affiliated with the city, including Ion Luca Caragiale, Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, Ioan A. Bassarabescu, Nichita Stănescu, Geo Bogza, Radu Tudoran, composer Paul Constantinescu and philosopher Petre P. Negulescu.

==Geology==
The Mio-Pliocene Zone in the Ploiești region has been exploited for hydrocarbons and coal since the 19th Century. The zone extends from the flysch on the north to the Moesian Platform on the south. The zone is marked by alternating deposits of Clay, Marl, Shale and Sand, conglomerate, Salt and Limestone. Structural traps and stratigraphic traps are formed from Salt Diapirism which gave rise to anticline folds and faulting. There are four major alignments of the anticlines, all parallel to the Carpathian Range. Pliocene sands are the main oil and gas producers, in particular the Meotian (60%) and Dacian (29%), followed by the Miocene Sarmatian (5%) but some oil exists in Miocene Helvetian and Oligocene sandstones. Major producing structures include Moreni-Gura Ocniței, Băicoi-Țintea and Boldești.
==Geography==
Ploiești lies in the center of Muntenia, in the central-northern part of the Wallachian Plain. It lies close to the capital city Bucharest and it had close connections with the capital city throughout the centuries. Ploiești lies at the 25°E meridian and the 44°55’N parallel (north).

: Sources provide differing estimates regarding Romanian production:
:*1942: &quot;The Axis Oil Position in Europe, November 1942&quot; by the Hartley Committee estimated that &quot;Romanian oil fields&quot; contributed 33% of Axis supplies.
:*1944: &quot;Ploiești, thirty-five miles () from Bucharest, supplied one-third of all the oil fuel Germany required for war purposes.&quot;
:*1999: The fragile, concentrated Bucharest facilities provided &quot;60% of Germany&#x27;s crude oil supply&quot;

<text>In scholastic moral philosophy, synderesis () or synteresis is habitual knowledge of the universal practical principles of moral action. The reasoning process in the field of speculative science presupposes certain fundamental axioms on which all science rests. Such are the principle of contradiction, &quot;a thing cannot be and not be at the same time,&quot; and self-evident truths like &quot;the whole is greater than its part&quot;. These are the first principles of the speculative intellect. In the field of moral conduct there are similar first principles of action, such as: &quot;evil must be avoided, good done&quot;; &quot;Do not do to others what you would not wish to be done to yourself&quot;; &quot;Parents should be honoured&quot;; &quot;We should live temperately and act justly&quot;. Such as these are self-evident truths in the field of moral conduct which any sane person will admit if he understands them. According to the Scholastics, the readiness with which such moral truths are apprehended by the practical intellect is due to the natural habit impressed on the cognitive faculty which they call synderesis. While conscience is a dictate of the practical reason deciding that any particular action is right or wrong, synderesis is a dictate of the same practical reason which has for its object the first general principles of moral action.

==History==
The notion of synderesis has a long tradition, including the Commentary on Ezekiel by Jerome (A.D. 347–419), where &quot;syntéresin&quot; (συντήρησιν) is mentioned among the powers of the soul and is described as the spark of conscience (&quot;scintilla conscientiae&quot;), and the interpretation of Jerome&#x27;s text given, in the 13th century, by Albert the Great and Thomas Aquinas in the light of Aristotelian psychology and ethics. An alternative interpretation of synderesis was proposed by Bonaventure, who considered it as the natural inclination of the will towards moral good.

The word &quot;synderesis&quot; is by most scholars reckoned to be a corruption of the Greek word for shared knowledge or conscience, &quot;syneidêsis&quot; (), the corruption appearing in the medieval manuscripts of Jerome&#x27;s Commentary.

The term is also used in psychiatric studies, with particular reference to psychopathy.

<doc id="327601" wikidata="Q2003186" url="?curid=327601" title="Sybian">
<text>A Sybian (), or Sybian saddle, is a type of masturbation device, consisting of a hollow saddle-like seat containing two electric motors, motor speed controller boards, gearing, pulleys, and a platform on cranked axles such that a ridge on the top of the unit can be made to vibrate through a range of speeds as set using a wired external hand controller, and an upward-pointing shaft set on an angle through the ridge can be made to rotate at speeds of up to several hundred revolutions per minute, again by use of the wired remote control. Flexible molded attachments are usually supplied, fitting over the vibrating ridge and shaft which mostly have integrated dildos on their top. In use, the rider inserts the dildo into a body orifice for internal stimulation while applying pressure on the vibrating ridge with their external erogenous parts.

==Development==
According to its inventor, Dave Lampert, the Sybian was first conceived in the 1970s and developed in 1983. A prototype was built in 1985 from sheet metal mounted on a wooden frame with a vibrator projecting through an opening inside the housing; a second prototype became the basis for current production models.

Lampert and his team initially called the device &quot;Master Better&quot;, shortened to &quot;MB&quot;, for about four years before selecting a new name for it. The prefix &quot;syb&quot; in Sybian was derived from Sybaris, an Ancient Greek city in southern Italy which was associated with luxurious living. It is currently manufactured by Abco Research Associates in Monticello, Illinois.

From research and experience, Lampert theorized that the woman on top position during intercourse works best for female orgasm and that stimulation is enhanced when the penis remains fully inserted and the female partner rocks her pelvis forward and backward, making contact with the sensitive G-spot located on the front wall of the vagina.

In 2016, Lampert was honored with an AVN lifetime achievement award for his invention. He died in July 2021 at the age of 90.

==Specifications==
The Sybian typically weighs around , and usually measures wide, long, and tall excluding the rubber attachment with an power cord. The unit is designed to work with or without a penetration attachment. When in operation, the Sybian distributes vibrations externally along the user&#x27;s pelvic floor, including clitoral glans, the introitus to their vagina and cavity of the anus. The optional penetration attachments rotate using a 20:1 ratio gear motor providing that can vary from 0 to 120 rpm and vibration is produced using a electric motor that may be controlled from 0 to 6500 rpm. Power and vibration/rotation are controlled with a remote control. The Sybian can hold over of weight. It has a padded naugahyde cover. The casing has built-in finger grips for carrying.

Generally, the user of the Sybian straddles the machine and administers the dildo attachment, inserting it into the vagina or the anus. The vibration and rotation can be controlled by separate on/off switches and two rotary controls. The Sybian is typically sold with multiple attachments of varying sizes made from synthetic rubber in various shapes.

==Publicity==
After its release in 1987, the Sybian was featured on the cover of that December&#x27;s issue of &quot;Penthouse Forum&quot;. It made its first pornographic video appearance in &quot;Orgasmatic&quot; (1998), which received an AVN award nomination for &quot;most outrageous sex scene&quot; for Ruby the Original&#x27;s performance with the device. 

Although the Sybian was featured in many pornographic video productions beginning in the early 2000s, primarily on the Internet, the device came to prominence on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; after that show&#x27;s switch to Sirius Satellite Radio.

<doc id="327602" wikidata="Q325412" url="?curid=327602" title="Robert Palmer">
<text>Robert Allen Palmer (19 January 1949 – 26 September 2003) was an English singer and songwriter. He was known for his powerful and soulful voice, his elegance, and his stylistic explorations, combining soul, funk, jazz, rock, pop, reggae, and blues. His 1986 song &quot;Addicted to Love&quot; and its accompanying video came to &quot;epitomise the glamour and excesses of the 1980s&quot;.

Having started in the music industry in the 1960s, including a spell with Vinegar Joe, Palmer found success in the 1980s, both in his solo career and with the Power Station, scoring Top 10 hits in the United Kingdom and the United States. Three of his hit singles, including &quot;Addicted to Love&quot;, featured music videos directed by British fashion photographer Terence Donovan.

Palmer received a number of awards throughout his career, including two Grammy Awards for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance and an MTV Video Music Award. He was also nominated for the Brit Award for British Male Solo Artist in 1987 and 1989. He died from a heart attack aged 54.

==Career==
===1964–1973: Early bands===
Palmer was born in 1949 in Batley, West Yorkshire. When he was only a few months old, he and his family moved to Malta, where his father worked in British naval intelligence. He was influenced as a child by blues, soul, and jazz music played on American Forces Radio and by his parents&#x27; musical tastes. His family returned to the UK when he was 12.

In his teens, Palmer moved to Scarborough, North Yorkshire. He joined his first band, the Mandrakes, at the age of 15 while still at Scarborough High School for Boys. He left school the next year, after obtaining six O-levels and briefly studied art at Scarborough School of Art &amp; Design, before landing a job at the &quot;Scarborough Evening News&quot;. He was reportedly fired after police found &quot;the stub of a cannabis joint in a raid on his bedsit&quot;.

Palmer&#x27;s first major break came with the departure of singer Jess Roden from the band the Alan Bown Set in 1969, after which Palmer was invited to London to sing on the band&#x27;s single &quot;Gypsy Girl&quot;. The vocals for the album &quot;The Alan Bown!&quot;, originally recorded by Roden (and released in the US that way), were re-recorded by Palmer after the success of the single. According to music journalist Paul Lester, Palmer rose from northern clubs in England to become &quot;elegant and sophisticated&quot; and the master of several styles.

In 1970, he joined the 12-piece jazz-rock fusion band Dada, which featured singer Elkie Brooks and her husband Pete Gage. After a year, Palmer, Brooks, and Gage formed soul/rock band Vinegar Joe. Palmer played rhythm guitar in the band and shared lead vocals with Brooks. Signed to the Island Records label, the band released three albums: &quot;Vinegar Joe&quot; (1972), &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Gypsies&quot; (1972), and &quot;Six Star General&quot; (1973), before disbanding in March 1974. Brooks later said Palmer &quot;was a very good-looking guy&quot;, and that female fans were happy to find that Brooks and Palmer were not romantically linked.

===1974–1978: Early solo career===
Island Records signed Palmer to a solo deal in 1974. His first solo album, &quot;Sneakin&#x27; Sally Through the Alley&quot;, recorded in 1974 in New Orleans was heavily influenced by the music of Little Feat and the funk fusion of the Meters, who acted as the backing band along with producer/guitarist Lowell George of Little Feat. Unsuccessful in the UK, both the album and single reached the top 100 in the US. Notably, &quot;Sailin&#x27; Shoes&quot; (the album&#x27;s first track, and a Little Feat cover), Palmer&#x27;s own &quot;Hey Julia&quot; and the Allen Toussaint-penned title track carry virtually the same rhythm, and were packaged on the album as a &quot;trilogy&quot; without a pause between them.

After relocating with his wife to New York City, Palmer released &quot;Pressure Drop&quot;, named for the cover version of the reggae hit by Toots and the Maytals, in November 1975 (featuring Motown bassist James Jamerson). He toured with Little Feat to promote the reggae and rock infused album. With the failure of follow-up album &quot;Some People Can Do What They Like&quot;, Palmer decided to move to Nassau, Bahamas directly across the street from Compass Point Studios.

In 1978, he released &quot;Double Fun&quot;, a collection of Caribbean-influenced rock, including a cover of the Kinks&#x27; &quot;You Really Got Me&quot;. The album reached the top 50 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; chart and scored a top 20 single with the Andy Fraser-penned &quot;Every Kinda People&quot; which featured Philly Sound bassist Bob Babbitt. The song has been covered by other artists including Chaka Demus and Pliers, Randy Crawford, the Mint Juleps (produced by Trevor Horn), and Amy Grant. It reached number 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

===1979–1984: Growing mainstream success===
Palmer&#x27;s next album was an artistic departure, concentrating on pure rock. 1979&#x27;s &quot;Secrets&quot; produced his second top 20 single with Moon Martin&#x27;s &quot;Bad Case of Loving You (Doctor, Doctor)&quot;. The number 14 hit also gave Palmer his second &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 year-end chart hit. The following year saw the release of &quot;Clues&quot;, produced by Palmer and featuring Chris Frantz and Gary Numan, which generated hits on both sides of the Atlantic, first with the radio-friendly single &quot;Johnny and Mary&quot; and then &quot;Looking for Clues&quot;. Catchy music videos matching the synth-pop stylings of new wave gave him much-needed exposure to a younger audience. The success was repeated with the 1982 EP release of &quot;Some Guys Have All the Luck&quot;. Going into the 1980s, Palmer&#x27;s increasing commercial success as a performer fuelled his work as a producer, including on Jamaican ska legend Desmond Dekker&#x27;s 1981 album &quot;Compass Point&quot;. In 1984, he helped Island label-mate John Martyn in the production of his album &quot;Sapphire&quot;.

April 1983 saw the release of &quot;Pride&quot;. While not as commercially successful as &quot;Clues&quot;, it featured the title song and Palmer&#x27;s cover of the System&#x27;s &quot;You Are in My System&quot;, with the System&#x27;s David Frank on keyboards. On 31 May 1983, Palmer&#x27;s concert at the Hammersmith Palais was recorded and broadcast on BBC Radio 1. On 23 July 1983, he performed at Duran Duran&#x27;s charity concert at Aston Villa football ground striking up friendships with members of Duran Duran which later spawned the supergroup the Power Station.

===1985–1989: The Power Station and MTV success===
When Duran Duran went on hiatus, guitarist Andy Taylor and bassist John Taylor joined former Chic drummer Tony Thompson and Palmer to form the Power Station. Their album &quot;The Power Station&quot;, recorded mainly at the New York recording studio after which the band was named, with overdubs and mixing at Compass Point Studios in Nassau, reached the top 20 in the UK and the top 10 in the US. It spawned two hit singles with &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; (US number 6) and a cover of the T. Rex song &quot;Get It On (Bang a Gong)&quot;, which peaked one position higher than the original at US number nine. Palmer&#x27;s song &#x27;Simply Irresistible&#x27; reached number four on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1988. Palmer performed live with the band only once that year, on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. The band toured and played Live Aid, with singer Michael Des Barres after Palmer bowed out at the last moment to go back into the recording studio and further his solo career.

Some critics described Palmer&#x27;s abandonment of the tour as being unprofessional. In &quot;Number One&quot; magazine, he countered the claims that he joined the band for money: &quot;Firstly, I didn&#x27;t need the money and, secondly the cash was a long time coming. It wasn&#x27;t exactly an experience that set me up for retirement.&quot; He also was accused of ripping off the Power Station sound for his own records. He responded, &quot;Listen, I gave the Power Station that sound. They took it from me, not the other way around.&quot;

====&quot;Riptide&quot; and move to EMI====
Palmer recorded the album &quot;Riptide&quot; at Compass Point Studios in 1985, recruiting Thompson and Andy Taylor to play on some tracks plus Power Station record producer Bernard Edwards, who worked with Thompson in Chic, to helm the production. &quot;Riptide&quot; featured the single &quot;Addicted to Love&quot;, which reached number 1 in the United States and number 5 in the United Kingdom. The single was accompanied by a memorable and much-imitated music video, directed by Terence Donovan, in which Palmer is surrounded by a bevy of near-identically clad, heavily made-up female models simulating musicians. Donovan also directed videos for the hits &quot;Simply Irresistible&quot; and &quot;I Didn&#x27;t Mean to Turn You On&quot;. All three videos contain similar elements, with women in heavy makeup and with near identical clothes and appearances. In September 1986, Palmer performed &quot;Addicted to Love&quot; at the 1986 MTV Video Music Awards in Los Angeles. In 1987, he won the Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance for &quot;Addicted to Love&quot;. At the 1987 Brit Awards, Palmer received his first nomination for Best British Male.

Another single from &quot;Riptide&quot;, his cover of Cherrelle&#x27;s &quot;I Didn&#x27;t Mean to Turn You On&quot;, also performed well (US number two, UK number nine). Another song, &quot;Trick Bag&quot;, was written by one of his major influences, New Orleans R&amp;B artist Earl King.

Concerned about the rising crime rate in Nassau and having landed a deal with EMI, Palmer moved to Lugano, Switzerland in 1987 and set up his own recording studio. Producing &quot;Heavy Nova&quot; in 1988, Palmer returned to experimenting this time with bossa nova rhythms, heavy rock and white-soul balladeering. He repeated his previous success of &quot;Addicted to Love&quot; with the video of &quot;Simply Irresistible&quot;, again with a troupe of female dancers in heavy makeup. The song reached number two in the US and was Palmer&#x27;s final top ten hit there. The ballad &quot;She Makes My Day&quot; also proved to be a hit in the UK, peaking at number 6. In 1989, he won a second Grammy for &quot;Simply Irresistible&quot;, which would later be featured in the Tony Award-winning musical &quot;Contact&quot;. At the 1989 Brit Awards, Palmer received his second nomination for Best British Male, and &quot;Simply Irresistible&quot; was nominated for Best British Single. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine voted Palmer the best-dressed rock star for 1990.

===1990s: Continued success===
Palmer expanded his range further for his next album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Explain&quot; (1990). It featured two UK top 10 hits with covers of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Baby Tonight&quot; (a collaboration with UB40) and Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;Mercy Mercy Me&quot;. Throughout the 1990s, Palmer ventured further into diverse material. The 1992 album &quot;Ridin&#x27; High&quot; was a tribute to the Tin Pan Alley era.

In 1994, Palmer released &quot;Honey&quot; to mixed reviews. While the album failed to produce any hit singles in the US, the album had three modest hit singles in the UK, &quot;Girl U Want&quot;, &quot;Know by Now&quot;, and &quot;You Blow Me Away&quot;. In 1995 he released a greatest hits album, which reached number 4 in the UK. Also in 1995 he reunited with other members of the Power Station to record a second album. Bassist John Taylor eventually backed out of the project, to be replaced by Bernard Edwards. Palmer and the rest of the band completed the album &quot;Living in Fear&quot; (1996), and had just begun touring when Edwards died from pneumonia.

In 1997, Palmer performed with Rod Stewart at Wembley.

==Personal life==
Palmer met Sue, his future wife, at Slough railway station in 1969, attracted by her style (silver-coloured boots and matching mini-dress) and by the science-fiction book she was reading. They married on his 21st birthday. They had two children. The family moved to New York City in the mid-1970s and then to the Bahamas a few years later. In 1987, Palmer and his family moved to Lugano, Switzerland. The couple divorced in 1993.

While he had not lived in Yorkshire for several decades, in the last interview he gave, Palmer said that the region, and his father, had given him &quot;a healthy work ethic, and a straight-forwardness&quot;.

==Death==
Palmer, an extremely heavy smoker from his teenage years, died from a heart attack in a Paris hotel room on 26 September 2003 at age 54. He had been there after recording a television appearance in London for &quot;My Kinda People&quot;, a Yorkshire TV retrospective. His long-term partner and musical colleague, Mary Ambrose, had joined him in Paris for a planned two-day break from the television studio. 

Among those who paid tribute were Duran Duran, saying, &quot;He was a very dear friend and a great artist. This is a tragic loss to the British music industry.&quot; A memorial service was held in Lugano.

<text>Rent-seeking is the act of growing one&#x27;s existing wealth by manipulating the social or political environment without creating new wealth.
Rent-seeking activities have negative effects on the rest of society. They result in reduced economic efficiency through misallocation of resources, stifled competition, reduced wealth creation, lost government revenue, heightened income inequality, risk of growing corruption and cronyism, decreased public trust in institutions, and potential national decline.

Successful capture of regulatory agencies (if any) to gain a coercive monopoly can result in advantages for rent-seekers in a market while imposing disadvantages on their uncorrupt competitors. This is one of many possible forms of rent-seeking behavior.

==Description==
The term &quot;rent&quot;, in the narrow sense of economic rent, was coined by the British 19th-century economist David Ricardo, but rent-seeking only became the subject of durable interest among economists and political scientists more than a century later after the publication of two influential papers on the topic by Gordon Tullock in 1967, and Anne Krueger in 1974. The word &quot;rent&quot; does not refer specifically to payment on a lease but rather to Adam Smith&#x27;s division of incomes into profit, wage, and economic rent. The origin of the term refers to gaining control of land or other natural resources. 

Georgist economic theory describes rent-seeking in terms of land rent, where the value of land largely comes from the natural resources native to the land, and from collectively-paid-for services, for example: State schools, law enforcement, fire prevention, mitigation services, etc. Rent seeking to the Georgist does not include those persons that may have invested substantial capital improvements to a piece of land, but rather those that perform in their role as mere titleholder. This is the dividing line between a rent-seeker and a property developer, which need not be the same person.

&quot;Rent-seeking&quot; is an attempt to obtain economic rent (i.e., the portion of income paid to a factor of production in excess of what is needed to keep it employed in its current use) by manipulating the social or political environment in which economic activities occur, rather than by creating new wealth. Rent-seeking implies extraction of uncompensated value from others without making any contribution to productivity. Because the nature of rent-seeking implies a fixed cost payment, only wealthy participants engage in these activities as a means of protecting their wealth from expropriation.

Some rent-seeking behaviors, such as the forming of cartels or the bribing of politicians, are illegal in many market-driven economies.

Rent-seeking is distinguished in theory from profit-seeking, in which entities seek to extract value by engaging in mutually beneficial transactions. Profit-seeking in this sense is the creation of wealth, while rent-seeking is &quot;profiteering&quot; by using social institutions, such as but not limited to the power of the state, to redistribute wealth among different groups without creating new wealth. In a practical context, income obtained through rent-seeking may contribute to profits in the standard, accounting sense of the word.

===Tullock paradox===
The Tullock paradox is the apparent paradox, described by economist Gordon Tullock, on the low costs of rent-seeking relative to the gains from rent-seeking.

The paradox is that rent-seekers wanting political favors can bribe politicians at a cost much lower than the value of the favor to the rent-seeker. For instance, a rent seeker who hopes to gain a billion dollars from a particular political policy may need to bribe politicians with merely ten million dollars, which is about 1% of the gain to the rent-seeker. Luigi Zingales frames it by asking, &quot;Why is there so little money in politics?&quot; because a naïve model of political bribery and/or campaign spending should result in beneficiaries of government subsidies being willing to spend an amount approaching the value of the profits derived from the subsidies themselves, when in fact only a small fraction of that is spent.

====Possible explanations====
Several possible explanations have been offered for the Tullock paradox:

# Voters may punish politicians who take large bribes, or live lavish lifestyles. This makes it hard for politicians to demand large bribes from rent-seekers.
# Competition between different politicians eager to offer favors to rent-seekers may bid down the cost of rent-seeking.
# Lack of trust between the rent-seekers and the politicians, due to the inherently underhanded nature of the deal and the unavailability of both legal recourse and reputational incentives to enforce compliance, pushes down the price that politicians can demand for favors.
# Rent-seekers can use a small part of the benefit gained to make contributions to the politicians who provided enabling legislation.

===Examples===
The classic example of rent-seeking, according to Robert Shiller, is that of a property owner who installs a chain across a river that flows through their land and then hires a collector to charge passing boats a fee to lower the chain. There is nothing productive about the chain or the collector, nor do passing boats get anything in return. The owner has made no improvements to the river and is not adding value in any way, directly or indirectly, except for themselves. All they are doing is finding a way to obtain money from something that used to be free.

An example of rent-seeking in a modern economy is spending money on lobbying for government subsidies to be given wealth that has already been created, or to impose regulations on competitors, to increase one&#x27;s own market share. Another example of rent-seeking is the limiting of access to lucrative occupations, as by medieval guilds or modern state certifications and licensures. According to some libertarian perspectives, taxi licensing is a textbook example of rent-seeking. To the extent that the issuing of licenses constrains overall supply of taxi services (rather than ensuring competence or quality), forbidding competition from other vehicles for hire renders the (otherwise consensual) transaction of taxi service a forced transfer of part of the fee, from customers to taxi business proprietors.

The concept of rent-seeking would also apply to corruption of bureaucrats who solicit and extract &quot;bribe&quot; or &quot;rent&quot; for applying their legal but discretionary authority for awarding legitimate or illegitimate benefits to clients. For example, taxpayers may bribe officials to lessen their tax burden.

Regulatory capture is a related term for the collusion between firms and the government agencies assigned to regulate them, which is seen as enabling extensive rent-seeking behavior, especially when the government agency must rely on the firms for knowledge about the market. Studies of rent-seeking focus on efforts to capture special monopoly privileges such as manipulating government regulation of free enterprise competition. The term &quot;monopoly privilege rent-seeking&quot; is an often-used label for this particular type of rent-seeking. Often-cited examples include a lobby that seeks economic regulations such as tariff protection, quotas, subsidies, or extension of copyright law. Anne Krueger concludes that &quot;empirical evidence suggests that the value of rents associated with import licenses can be relatively large, and it has been shown that the welfare cost of quantitative restrictions equals that of their tariff equivalents plus the value of the rents&quot;.

Rent-seeking through government enterprise takes the form of seeking subsidies and avoiding tariffs. This seems like the actions of a firm looking for investment in productivity but in doing so creates an exclusionary effect for more productive firms.

Lotta Moberg presents an argument that export processing zones (EPZ) allow governments to choose exporting industries which receive tariffs allowing for rent seeking to take place. An example of this occurred in Latin America in the 1960s with Joaquín Balaguer&#x27;s response to pressure from the United States to open the Dominican Republic&#x27;s export market. At the time, the United States was a massive trading partner for sugar while providing foreign aid and military support which allowed Balaguer&#x27;s regime to take hold. Joaquín Balaguer used EPZ to allow for some markets to remain tariffed while appeasing the markets facing political pressures. This created a sub-optimal environment for exporters as they were able to invest in rent seeking activities (lobbying) to gain access to EPZ to gain tax and tariff exemptions.

In some cases, rent-seeking can provide a net positive for an economy. Shannon K. Mitchell&#x27;s article &quot;The Welfare Effects of Rent-Saving and Rent-Seeking&quot; provides such an example through a model of rent-seeking when firms need to expand to obtain their exporting rents.

Economists such as Lord Adair Turner, the former chair of the British Financial Services Authority, have argued that innovation in the financial industry is often a form of rent-seeking.

==Development of theory==
The phenomenon of rent-seeking in connection with monopolies was first formally identified in 1967 by Gordon Tullock.

A 2013 study by the World Bank showed that the incentives for policy-makers to engage in rent-provision is conditional on the institutional incentives they face, with elected officials in stable high-income democracies the least likely to indulge in such activities vis-à-vis entrenched bureaucrats and/or their counterparts in young and quasi-democracies.

===Criticism===
In the 1980s, critiques of rent-seeking theory began to emerge, questioning the ambiguity of the concept of &quot;wasted resources&quot; and the reliability of the assumptions being made from it. Samuels argues that productivity is defined by rent-seeking theorists as a strictly physical property but ignores the rights that surround and define the product. He further asserts that rent-seeking theorists ignore a fundamental principle of being economic actors: that we live in markets of scarce resources and it is how we use these resources which drives supply and demand, and the notion of &quot;wasted resources&quot; rejects our preferences to allocate those resources.

Writing in &quot;The Review of Austrian Economics&quot;, Ernest C. Pasour says that there may be difficulties distinguishing between beneficial profit-seeking and detrimental rent-seeking.

== Possible consequences ==
From a theoretical standpoint, the moral hazard of rent-seeking can be considerable. If &quot;buying&quot; a favorable regulatory environment seems cheaper than building more efficient production, a firm may choose the former option, reaping incomes entirely unrelated to any contribution to total wealth or well-being. This results in a sub-optimal allocation of resourcesmoney spent on lobbyists and counter-lobbyists rather than on research and development, on improved business practices, on employee training, or on additional capital goodswhich slows economic growth. Claims that a firm is rent-seeking therefore often accompany allegations of government corruption, or the undue influence of special interests.

Rent-seeking can prove costly to economic growth; high rent-seeking activity makes more rent-seeking attractive because of the natural and growing returns that one sees as a result of rent-seeking. Thus organizations value rent-seeking over productivity. In this case, there are very high levels of rent-seeking with very low levels of output. Rent-seeking may grow at the cost of economic growth because rent-seeking by the state can easily hurt innovation. Ultimately, public rent-seeking hurts the economy the most because innovation drives economic growth.

Government agents may initiate rent-seeking, as by soliciting bribes or other favors from the individuals or firms that stand to gain from having special economic privileges, which opens up the possibility of exploitation of the consumer. It has been shown that rent-seeking by bureaucracy can push up the cost of production of public goods. It has also been shown that rent-seeking by tax officials may cause loss in revenue to the public exchequer.

Mançur Olson traced the historic consequences of rent seeking in &quot;The Rise and Decline of Nations&quot;. As a country becomes increasingly dominated by organized interest groups, it loses economic vitality and falls into decline. Olson argued that countries that have a collapse of the political regime and the interest groups that have coalesced around it can radically improve productivity and increase national income because they start with a clean slate in the aftermath of the collapse. An example of this is Japan after World War Two. But new coalitions form over time, once again shackling society to redistribute wealth and income to themselves. However, social and technological changes have allowed new enterprises and groups to emerge.

A study by Laband and John Sophocleus in 1988 estimated that rent-seeking had decreased total income in the US by 45 percent. Both Dougan and Tullock affirm the difficulty of finding the cost of rent-seeking. Rent-seekers of government-provided benefits will in turn spend up to that amount of benefit to gain those benefits, in the absence of, for example, the collective-action constraints highlighted by Olson. Similarly, taxpayers lobby for loopholes and will spend the value of those loopholes, again, to obtain those loopholes (again absent collective-action constraints). The total of wastes from rent-seeking is then the total amount from the government-provided benefits and instances of tax avoidance (valuing benefits and avoided taxes at zero). Dougan says that the &quot;total rent-seeking costs equal the sum of aggregate current income plus the net deficit of the public sector&quot;.

Mark Gradstein writes about rent-seeking in relation to public goods provision, and says that public goods are determined by rent seeking or lobbying activities. But the question is whether private provision with free-riding incentives or public provision with rent-seeking incentives is more inefficient in its allocation.

Political rent-seeking can also affect immigration. Welfare states incentivise unproductive migration and can create continuation of past behaviour of not accumulating personal wealth and being dependent on government transfers. Alternatively, productive migrants are incentivised to leave rent-seeking societies, possibly resulting in further economic decline.

The Nobel Memorial Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz has argued that rent-seeking contributes significantly to income inequality in the United States through lobbying for government policies that let the wealthy and powerful get income, not as a reward for creating wealth, but by grabbing a larger share of the wealth that would otherwise have been produced without their effort. Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez, and Stefanie Stantcheva have analyzed international economies and their changes in tax rates to conclude that much of income inequality is a result of rent-seeking among wealthy tax payers.

Laband and John Sophocleus suggest that the lack of empirical evidence on rent-seeking is due to the broad scope of rent-seeking and rent avoidance activities. Additionally, they suggest that many economic performance measures, such as Gross Domestic Product, include goods and services that are part of the rent-seeking process.

In 2023, Angus Deaton wrote:In retrospect it is not so surprising that free markets, or at least free markets with a government that permits and encourages rent seeking by the rich, should produce not equality but an extractive elite that predates on the population at large. Utopian rhetoric about freedom has led to an unjust social dystopia, not for the first time. Free markets with rent seekers are not the same as &quot;competitive&quot; markets; indeed, they are often exactly the opposite.

<text>RadioShack (formerly written as Radio Shack) is an American electronics retailer that was established in 1921 as an amateur radio mail-order business. Its original parent company, Radio Shack Corporation, was purchased by Tandy Corporation in 1962, shifting its focus from radio equipment to hobbyist electronic components sold in retail stores. At its peak in 1999, Tandy operated over 8,000 RadioShack stores in the United States, Mexico, and Canada, and under the Tandy name in The Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Australia.

The 21st century proved to be a period of gradual decline. In February 2015, after years of management crises, poor worker relations, diminished revenue, and 11 consecutive quarterly losses, RadioShack was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and subsequently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In May 2015, the company&#x27;s assets, including the RadioShack brand name and related intellectual property, were purchased by General Wireless, a subsidiary of Standard General, for US$26.2 million.

In March 2017, General Wireless and subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy, claiming that a store-within-a-store partnership with Sprint was not as profitable as expected. As a result, RadioShack shuttered several company-owned stores and announced plans to shift its business primarily online.

RadioShack was acquired by Retail Ecommerce Ventures, a holding company owned by Alex Mehr and self-help influencer Tai Lopez, in November 2020. RadioShack operated primarily as an e-commerce website with a network of independently owned and franchised RadioShack stores, as well as a supplier of parts for HobbyTown USA.

In May 2023, Unicomer Group acquired control of the worldwide RadioShack franchise. Unicomer is based in El Salvador and is one of the largest franchisors of RadioShack, with stores in Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. It had purchased its first RadioShack franchise (in El Salvador) in January 1998.

== History ==
=== The first 40 years ===
The company was started as Radio Shack in 1921 by two brothers, Theodore and Milton Deutschmann, who wanted to provide equipment for the new field of amateur radio (also known as ham radio). The brothers opened a one-store retail and mail-order operation in the heart of downtown Boston at 46 Brattle Street. They chose the name &quot;Radio Shack&quot;, which was the term for a small, wooden structure that housed a ship&#x27;s radio equipment. The Deutschmanns thought the name was appropriate for a store that would supply the needs of radio officers aboard ships, as well as hams (amateur radio operators). The idea for the name came from an employee, Bill Halligan, who went on to form the Hallicrafters company. The term was already in use — and is to this day — by hams when referring to the location of their stations.

The company issued its first catalog in 1939 as it entered the high-fidelity music market. In 1954, Radio Shack began selling its own private-label products under the brand name Realist, changing the brand name to Realistic after being sued by Stereo Realist.

During the period the chain was based in Boston, it was commonly referred to disparagingly by its customers as &quot;Nagasaki Hardware&quot;, as much of the merchandise was sourced from Japan, then perceived as a source of low-quality, inexpensive parts.

In 1959, the store moved its headquarters to 730 Commonwealth Avenue in Boston (across the street from Boston University&#x27;s Marsh Chapel), with ambitious plans for further expansion. After expanding to nine stores plus an extensive mail-order business, the company fell on hard times in the early 1960s.

=== Tandy Corporation ===
Tandy Corporation, a leather goods corporation, was looking for other hobbyist-related businesses into which it could expand. Charles D. Tandy saw the potential of Radio Shack and retail consumer electronics, purchasing the company in 1962 for US$300,000.
At the time of the &quot;Tandy Radio Shack &amp; Leather&quot; 1962 acquisition, the Radio Shack chain was nearly bankrupt.

Tandy&#x27;s strategy was to appeal to hobbyists. It created small stores that were staffed by people who knew electronics, and sold mainly private brands. Tandy closed Radio Shack&#x27;s unprofitable mail-order business, ended credit purchases and eliminated many top management positions, keeping the salespeople, merchandisers and advertisers. The number of items carried was cut from 40,000 to 2,500, as Tandy sought to &quot;identify the 20% that represents 80% of the sales&quot; and replace Radio Shack&#x27;s handful of large stores with many &quot;little holes in the wall&quot;, large numbers of rented locations which were easier to close and re-open elsewhere if one location didn&#x27;t work out. Private-label brands from lower-cost manufacturers displaced name brands to raise Radio Shack profit margins; non-electronic lines from go-carts to musical instruments were abandoned entirely.

Customer data from the former RadioShack mail-order business determined where Tandy would locate new stores. As an incentive for them to work long hours and remain profitable, store managers were required to take an ownership stake in their stores. In markets too small to support a company-owned Radio Shack store, the chain relied on independent dealers who carried the products as a sideline. Charles D. Tandy said &quot;We&#x27;re not looking for the guy who wants to spend his entire paycheck on a sound system&quot;, instead seeking customers &quot;looking to save money by buying cheaper goods and improving them through modifications and accessorizing&quot;, making it common among &quot;nerds&quot; and &quot;kids aiming to excel at their science fairs&quot;.

Charles D. Tandy, who had guided the firm through a period of growth in the 1960s and 1970s, died of a heart attack at age 60 in November 1978.

In 1982, the breakup of the Bell System encouraged subscribers to own their own telephones instead of renting them from local phone companies; Radio Shack offered twenty models of home phones.

Much of the Radio Shack line was manufactured in the company&#x27;s own factories. By 1990/1991, Tandy was the world&#x27;s biggest manufacturer of personal computers; its OEM manufacturing capacity was building hardware for Digital Equipment Corporation, GRiD, Olivetti, AST Computer, Panasonic, and others. The company manufactured everything from store fixtures to computer software to wire and cable, TV antennas, audio and videotape. At one point, Radio Shack was the world&#x27;s largest electronics chain.

In June 1991, Tandy closed or restructured its 200 Radio Shack Computer Centers, acquired Computer City, and attempted to shift its emphasis away from components and cables, toward mainstream consumer electronics. Tandy sold its computer manufacturing to AST Research in 1993, including the laptop computer Grid Systems Corporation which it had purchased in 1988. It sold the Memorex consumer recording trademarks to a Hong Kong firm, and divested most of its manufacturing divisions. House-brand products, which Radio Shack had long marked up heavily, were replaced with third-party brands already readily available from competitors. This reduced profit margins.

In 1992, Tandy attempted to launch big-box electronics retailer Incredible Universe; most of the seventeen stores never turned a profit. Its six profitable stores were sold to Fry&#x27;s Electronics in 1996; the others were closed. Other rebranding attempts included the launch or acquisition of chains including McDuff, Video Concepts and the Edge in Electronics; these were larger stores which carried TVs, appliances and other lines.

Tandy closed the McDuff stores and abandoned Incredible Universe in 1996, but continued to add new RadioShack stores. By 1996, industrial parts suppliers were deploying e-commerce to sell a wide range of components online; it would be another decade before RadioShack would sell parts from its website, with a selection so limited that it was no rival to established industrial vendors with million-item specialised, centralised inventories.

In 1994, the company introduced a service known as &quot;The Repair Shop at Radio Shack&quot;, through which it provided inexpensive out-of-warranty repairs for more than 45 different brands of electronic equipment. The company already had over one million parts in its extensive parts warehouses and 128 service centers throughout the US and Canada; it hoped to leverage these to build customer relationships and increase store traffic. Len Roberts, president of the Radio Shack division since 1993, estimated that the new repair business could generate $500 million per year by 1999.

&quot;America&#x27;s technology store&quot; was abandoned for the &quot;you&#x27;ve got questions, we&#x27;ve got answers&quot; slogan in 1994. In early summer 1995, the company changed its logo; &quot;Radio Shack&quot; was spelled in camel case as &quot;RadioShack&quot;. In 1996, RadioShack successfully petitioned the US Federal Communications Commission to allocate frequencies for the Family Radio Service, a short-range walkie-talkie system that proved popular.

==== Battery of the Month ====
From the 1960s until the early 1990s, Radio Shack promoted a &quot;battery of the month&quot; club; a free wallet-sized cardboard card offered one free Enercell per month in-store. Like the free vacuum tube testing offered in-store in the early 1970s, this small loss leader drew foot traffic. The cards also served as generic business cards for the salespeople.

==== Allied Radio ====
In 1970, Tandy Corporation bought Allied Radio Corporation (both retail and industrial divisions), merging the brands into Allied Radio Shack and closing duplicate locations. After a 1973 federal government review, the company sold off the few remaining Allied retail stores and resumed using the Radio Shack name. Allied Electronics, the firm&#x27;s industrial component operation, continued as a Tandy division until it was sold to Spartan Manufacturing in 1981.

==== Flavoradio ====

The longest-running product for Radio Shack was the AM-only Realistic Flavoradio, sold from 1972 to 2000, 28 years in three designs. This also made the Flavoradio the longest production run in radio history. It was originally released in five colors in the 1972 catalog: vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, avocado, and plum. For 1973, vanilla and chocolate were dropped (and thus are rare today) and replaced by lemon and orange. At some point two-tone models with white backs were offered but never appeared in catalogs; these are extremely rare today.

The original design had five transistors (model 166). A sixth was added in 1980 (model 166a). The case was redesigned for 1987, making it taller and thinner, and it came in red, blue, and black. The final model, 201a, came in 1996 and was designed around an integrated circuit. They were first made in Korea then Hong Kong and finally the Philippines. The Flavoradio carried the Realistic name until about 1996, when it switched to &quot;Radio Shack&quot;, then finally &quot;Optimus&quot;. When the Flavoradio was dropped from the catalog in 2001, it was the last AM-only radio on the market.

==== CB radio ====

The chain profited from the mass popularity of citizens band radio in the mid-1970s which, at its peak, represented nearly 30% of the chain&#x27;s revenue.

==== Home computers ====
In 1977, two years after the MITS Altair 8800, Radio Shack introduced the TRS-80, one of the first mass-produced personal computers. This was a complete pre-assembled system at a time when many microcomputers were built from kits, backed by a nationwide retail chain when computer stores were in their infancy. Sales of the initial, primitive US$600 (equal to $ today) TRS-80 exceeded all expectations despite its limited capabilities and high price. This was followed by the TRS-80 Color Computer in 1980, designed to attach to a television. Tandy also inspired the &quot;Tandy Computer Whiz Kids&quot; (1982–1991), a comic-book duo of teen calculator enthusiasts who teamed up with the likes of Archie and Superman. Radio Shack&#x27;s computer stores offered lessons to pre-teens as &quot;Radio Shack Computer Camp&quot; in the early 1980s.

By September 1982, the company had more than 4,300 stores, and more than 2,000 independent franchises in towns not large enough for a company-owned store. The latter also sold third-party hardware and software for Tandy computers, but company-owned stores did not sell or even acknowledge the existence of non-Tandy products. In the mid-1980s, Radio Shack began a transition from its proprietary 8-bit computers to its proprietary IBM PC compatible Tandy computers, removing the &quot;Radio Shack&quot; name from the product in an attempt to shake off the long-running nicknames &quot;Radio Scrap&quot; and &quot;Trash 80&quot; to make the product appeal to business users. Poor compatibility, shrinking margins and a lack of economies of scale led Radio Shack to exit the computer-manufacturing market in the 1990s after losing much of the desktop PC market to newer, price-competitive rivals like Dell. Tandy acquired the Computer City chain in 1991, and sold the stores to CompUSA in 1998.

In 1994, RadioShack began selling IBM&#x27;s Aptiva line of home computers. This partnership would last until 1998, when RadioShack partnered with Compaq and created &#x27;The Creative Learning Center&#x27; as a store-within-a-store to promote desktop PCs. Similar promotions were tried with &#x27;The Sprint Store at RadioShack&#x27; (mobile telephones), &#x27;RCA Digital Entertainment Center&#x27; (home audio and video products), and &#x27;PowerZone&#x27; (RadioShack&#x27;s line of battery products, power supplies, and surge protectors).

=== RadioShack Corporation ===

In the mid-1990s, the company attempted to move out of small components and into more mainstream consumer markets, focusing on marketing wireless phones. This placed the chain, long accustomed to charging wide margins on specialized products not readily available from other local retailers, into direct competition against vendors such as Best Buy and Walmart.

In May 2000, the company dropped the Tandy name altogether, becoming RadioShack Corporation. The leather operating assets were sold to The Leather Factory on November 30, 2000; that business remains profitable.

House brands Realistic and Optimus were discontinued. In 1999, the company agreed to carry RCA products in a five-year agreement for a &quot;RCA Digital Entertainment Center&quot; store-within-a-store. When the RCA contract ended, RadioShack introduced its own Presidian and Accurian brands, reviving the Optimus brand in 2005 for some low-end products. Enercell, a house brand for dry cell batteries, remained in use until approximately 2014.
Most of the RadioShack house brands had been dropped when Tandy divested its manufacturing facilities in the early 1990s; the original list included: &quot;Realistic&quot; (stereo, hi-fi and radio), &quot;Archer&quot; (antenna rotors and boosters), &quot;Micronta&quot; (test equipment), &quot;Tandy&quot; (computers), &quot;TRS-80&quot; (proprietary computer), &quot;ScienceFair&quot; (kits), &quot;DuoFone&quot; (landline telephony), &quot;Concertmate&quot; (music synthesizer), &quot;Enercell&quot; (cells and batteries), &quot;Road Patrol&quot; (radar detectors, bicycle radios), &quot;Patrolman&quot; (Realistic radio scanner), &quot;Deskmate&quot; (software), &quot;KitchenMate&quot;, &quot;Stereo Shack&quot;, &quot;Supertape&quot; (recording tape), &quot;Mach One&quot;, &quot;Optimus&quot; (speakers and turntables), &quot;Flavoradio&quot; (pocket AM radios in various colours), &quot;Weatheradio&quot;, &quot;Portavision&quot; (small televisions) and &quot;Minimus&quot; (speakers).

In 2000, RadioShack was one of multiple backers of the CueCat barcode reader, which soon turned out to be a marketing failure. The company had invested US$35 million in the concept, including printing the barcodes throughout its catalogs, and distributing CueCat devices to customers at no charge.

The last annual RadioShack printed catalogs were distributed to the public in 2003.

Until 2004, RadioShack routinely asked for the name and address of purchasers so they could be added to mailing lists. Name and mailing address were requested for special orders (RadioShack Unlimited parts and accessories, Direc2U items not stocked locally), returns, check payments, RadioShack Answers Plus credit card applications, service plan purchases and carrier activations of cellular telephones.

On December 20, 2005, RadioShack announced the sale of its newly built riverfront Fort Worth, Texas headquarters building to German-based KanAm Grund; the property was leased back to RadioShack for 20 years. In 2008, RadioShack assigned this lease to the Tarrant County College District (TCC), remaining in of the space as its headquarters.

In 2005, RadioShack parted with Verizon for a 10-year agreement with Cingular (later AT&amp;T) and renegotiated its 11-year agreement with Sprint. In July 2011, RadioShack ended its wireless partnership with T-Mobile, replacing it with the &quot;Verizon Wireless Store&quot; within a store. 2005 under the leadership of Jim Hamilton, marked a banner year for wireless. RadioShack sold more mobile phones than Walmart, Circuit City and Best Buy combined.

RadioShack had not made products under the Realistic name since the early 1990s. Support for many of Radio Shack&#x27;s traditional product lines, including amateur radio, had ended by 2006. A handful of small-town franchise dealers used their ability to carry non-RadioShack merchandise to bring in parts from outside sources, but these represented a minority.

==== PointMobl and &quot;The Shack&quot; ====
In mid-December 2008, RadioShack opened three concept stores under the name &quot;PointMobl&quot; to sell wireless phones and service, netbooks, iPod and GPS navigation devices. The three Texas stores (Dallas, Highland Village and Allen) were furnished with white fixtures like those in the remodelled wireless departments of individual RadioShack stores, but there was no communicated relationship to RadioShack itself. Had the test proved successful, RadioShack could have moved to convert existing RadioShack locations into PointMobl stores in certain markets.

While some PointMobl products, such as car power adapters and phone cases, were carried as store-brand products in RadioShack stores, the stand-alone PointMobl stores were closed and the concept abandoned in March 2011.

In August 2009, RadioShack rebranded itself as &quot;The Shack&quot;. The campaign increased sales of mobile products, but at the expense of its core components business.

RadioShack aggressively promoted Dish Network subscriptions.

In November 2012, RadioShack introduced Amazon Locker parcel pick-up services at its stores, only to dump the program in September 2013. In 2013, the chain made token attempts to regain the do it yourself market, including a new &quot;Do It Together&quot; slogan.

Long-time staff observed a slow and gradual shift away from electronic parts and customer service and toward promotion of wireless sales and add-ons; the pressure to sell gradually increased, while the focus on training and product knowledge decreased. Morale was abysmal; longtime employees who were paid bonus and retirement in stock options saw the value of these instruments fade away.

==== Financial decline ====
In 1998, RadioShack called itself the single largest seller of consumer telecommunications products in the world; its stock reached its peak a year later.

InterTAN, a former Tandy subsidiary, sold the Tandy UK stores in 1999 and the Australian stores in 2001. InterTAN was sold (with its Canadian stores) to rival Circuit City in 2004. The RadioShack brand remained in use in the United States, but the 21st century proved a period of long decline for the chain, which was slow to respond to key trends— such as e-commerce, the entry of competitors like Best Buy and Amazon.com, and the growth of the maker movement.

By 2011, smartphone sales, rather than general electronics, accounted for half of the chain&#x27;s revenue. The traditional RadioShack clientele of do-it-yourself tinkerers were increasingly sidelined. Electronic parts formerly stocked in stores were now mostly only available through on-line special order. Store employees concentrated efforts selling profitable mobile contracts, while other customers seeking assistance were neglected and left the stores in frustration.

Demand for consumer electronics was also increasingly being weakened by consumers buying the items online.

==== 2004: &quot;Fix 1500&quot; initiative ====
In early 2004, RadioShack introduced &quot;Fix 1500&quot;, a sweeping program to &quot;correct&quot; inventory and profitability issues company-wide. The program put the 1,500 lowest-graded store managers, of over 5,000, on notice of the need to improve. Managers were graded not on tangible store and personnel data but on one-on-one interviews with district management.

Typically, a 90-day period was given for the manager to improve (thus causing another manager to then be selected for &quot;Fix 1500&quot;). A total of 1,734 store managers were reassigned as sales associates or terminated in a 6-month period. Also, during this period, RadioShack cancelled the employee stock purchase plan. By the first quarter of 2005, the metrics of skill assessment used during &quot;Fix 1500&quot; had already been discarded, and the corporate officer who created the program had resigned.

In 2004, RadioShack was the target of a class-action lawsuit in which more than 3,300 current or former RadioShack managers alleged the company required them to work long hours without overtime pay. In an attempt to suppress the news, the company launched a successful strategic lawsuit against public participation against Bradley D. Jones, the webmaster of RadioShackSucks.com and a former RadioShack dealer for 17 years.

==== 2006: Management problems ====
On February 20, 2006, CEO David Edmondson admitted to &quot;misstatements&quot; on his curriculum vitae and resigned after the Fort Worth Star-Telegram debunked his claim to degrees in theology and psychology from Heartland Baptist Bible College.

Chief operating officer Claire Babrowski briefly took over as CEO and president. A 31-year veteran of McDonald&#x27;s Corporation, where she had been vice president and Chief Restaurant Operations Officer, Babrowski had joined RadioShack several months prior. She left the company in August 2006, later becoming CEO and Executive Vice President of Toys &quot;R&quot; Us.

RadioShack&#x27;s board of directors appointed Julian C. Day as chairman and chief executive officer on July 7, 2006. Day had financial experience and had played a key role in revitalizing such companies as Safeway, Sears and Kmart but lacked any practical front-line sales experience needed to run a retail company. &quot;The Consumerist&quot; named him one of the &quot;10 Crappiest CEOs&quot; of 2009 (among consumer-facing companies, according to their own employees). He resigned in May 2011.

RadioShack Chief Financial Officer James Gooch succeeded Day as CEO in 2011, but &quot;agreed to step down&quot; 16 months later following a 73% plunge in the price of the stock. On February 11, 2013, RadioShack Corp. hired Joseph C. Magnacca from Walgreens, because he had experience in retail.

==== 2006: Corporate layoffs and new strategy ====
In the spring of 2006, RadioShack announced a strategy to increase average unit volume, lower overhead costs, and grow profitable square footage. In early to mid-2006, RadioShack closed nearly 500 locations. It was determined that some stores were too close to each other, causing them to compete with one another for the same customers. Most of the stores closed in 2006 brought in less than US$350,000 in revenue each year.

Despite these actions, stock prices plummeted within what was otherwise a booming market. On August 10, 2006, RadioShack announced plans to eliminate a fifth of its company headquarters workforce to reduce overhead expense, improving its long-term competitive position while supporting a significantly smaller number of stores. On Tuesday, August 29, the affected workers received an e-mail: &quot;The work force reduction notification is currently in progress. Unfortunately your position is one that has been eliminated.&quot; Four hundred and three workers were given 30 minutes to collect their personal effects, say their goodbyes to co-workers and then attend a meeting with their senior supervisors. Instead of issuing severance payments immediately, the company withheld them to ensure that company-issued BlackBerrys, laptops and cellphones were returned. This move drew immediate widespread public criticism for its lack of sensitivity.

==== 2009: Customer relations problems ====
RadioShack and the Better Business Bureau of Fort Worth, Texas, met on April 23, 2009, to discuss unanswered and unresolved complaints. The company implemented a plan of action to address existing and future customer service issues. Stores were directed to post a sign with the district manager&#x27;s name, the question &quot;How Are We Doing?&quot; and a direct toll-free number to the individual district office for their area. RadioShackHelp.com was created as another portal for customers to resolve their issues through the Internet. , the BBB had upgraded RadioShack from an &quot;F&quot; to an &quot;A&quot; rating; this was changed to &quot;no rating&quot; after the 2015 bankruptcy filing.

According to an experience ratings report published by Temkin Group, an independent research firm, RadioShack was ranked as the retailer with the worst overall customer experience; it maintained this position for six consecutive years.

==== 2012–2014: Financial distress ====
From 2000 to 2011, RadioShack spent US$2.6 billion repurchasing its own stock in an attempt to prop up a share price which fell from US$24.33 to US$2.53; the buyback and the stock dividend were suspended in 2012 to conserve cash and reduce debt as the company continued to lose money. Company stock had declined 81 percent since 2010 and was trading well below book value. The stock reached an all-time low on April 14, 2012. In September 2012, RadioShack&#x27;s head office laid off 130 workers after a US$21 million quarterly loss. Layoffs continued in August 2013; headquarters employment dropped from more than 2,000 before the 2006 layoffs to slightly fewer than 1,000 in late 2013. At the end of 2013, the chain owned 4,297 US stores.

The company had received a cash infusion in 2013 from Salus Capital Partners and Cerberus Capital Management. This debt carried onerous conditions, preventing RadioShack from gaining control over costs by limiting store closures to 200 per year and restricting the company&#x27;s refinancing efforts. With too many underperforming stores remaining open, the chain continued to spiral toward bankruptcy.

On March 4, 2014, the company announced a net trading loss for 2013 of US$400.2 million, well above the 2012 loss of US$139.4 million, and proposed a restructuring which would close 1,100 lower-performing stores, almost 20% of its US locations. On May 9, 2014, the company reported that creditors had prevented it from carrying out those closures, with one lender presuming fewer stores would mean fewer assets to secure the loan and reduce any recovery it would get in a bankruptcy reorganization.

On June 10, 2014, RadioShack said that it had enough cash to last 12 months, but that lasting a year depended on sales growing. Sales had fallen for nine straight quarters, and by year&#x27;s end the company realized a loss in &quot;each of its 10 latest quarters&quot;. On June 20, 2014, RadioShack&#x27;s stock price fell below US$1, triggering a July 25 warning from the New York Stock Exchange that it could be delisted for failure to maintain a stock price above $1. On July 28, 2014, Mergermarket&#x27;s Debtwire reported RadioShack was discussing Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as an option.

On September 11, 2014, RadioShack admitted it might have to file for bankruptcy, and would be unable to finance its operations &quot;beyond the very near term&quot; unless the company was sold, restructured, or received a major cash infusion. On September 15, 2014, RadioShack replaced its CFO with a bankruptcy specialist. On October 3, RadioShack announced an out-of-court restructuring, a 4:1 dilution of shares, and a rights issue priced at 40 cents a share. RadioShack&#x27;s stock () was halted on the New York exchange for the entire day. Despite the debt restructuring proposal, in December Salus and Cerberus informed RadioShack that it was in default of the they had provided as a cash infusion in 2013.

At the end of October 2014, quarterly figures indicated RadioShack was losing US$1.1 million per day. A November 2014 attempt to keep the stores open from 8AM to midnight on Thanksgiving Day drew a sharp backlash from employees and a few resignations; comparable store sales for the three days (Thursday-Saturday) were 1% lower than the prior year, when the stores were open for two of the days. The company&#x27;s problems maintaining inventories of big-ticket items, such as Apple&#x27;s iPhone 6, further cut into sales.

By December 2014, RadioShack was being sued by former employees for having encouraged them to invest 401(k) retirement savings in company stock, alleging a breach of fiduciary duties to &quot;prudently&quot; handle the retirement fund which caused &quot;devastating losses&quot; in the retirement plans as the stock dropped from US$13 in 2011 to 38 cents at the end of 2014. These claims were dismissed by the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2018.

==== 2015 bankruptcy ====

On January 15, 2015, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported RadioShack had delayed rent payments to some commercial landlords and was preparing a bankruptcy filing that could come as early as February. Officials of the company declined to comment on the report. A separate report by Bloomberg claimed the company might sell leases to as many as half its stores to Sprint.

On February 2, 2015, the company was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange after its average market capitalization remained below US$50 million for longer than thirty consecutive days. That same day, &quot;Bloomberg News&quot; reported RadioShack was in talks to sell half of its stores to Sprint and close the rest, which would effectively render RadioShack no longer a stand-alone retailer. Amazon.com and Brookstone were also mentioned to be potential bidders, the former having at the time been wanting to establish a brick and mortar presence. On February 3, RadioShack defaulted on its loan from Salus Capital.
On the days following these reports, some employees were instructed to reduce prices and transfer inventory out of stores designated for closing to those that would remain open during the presumed upcoming bankruptcy proceedings, while the rest remained &quot;in the dark&quot; as to the company&#x27;s future. Many stores had already closed abruptly on Sunday, February 1, 2015, the first day of the company&#x27;s fiscal year, with employees only given a few hours advance notice. Some had been open with a skeleton crew, little inventory and reduced hours only because the Salus Capital loan terms limited the chain to 200 store closures a year. A creditor group alleged the chain had remained on life support instead of shutting down earlier and cutting its losses merely so that Standard General could avoid paying on credit default swaps which expired on December 20, 2014.

On February 5, 2015, RadioShack announced that it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Using bankruptcy to end contractual restrictions that had required it keep unprofitable stores open, the company immediately published a list of 1784 stores which it intended to close, a process it wished to complete by the month&#x27;s end to avoid an estimated US$7 million in March rent.

Customers had initially been given until March 6, 2015, to return merchandise or redeem unused gift cards. However, after legal pressure from the Attorneys General of several states, RadioShack ultimately agreed to reimburse customers for the value of unused gift cards.

RadioShack was criticized for including the personally identifying information of 67 million of its customers as part of its assets for sale during the proceedings, despite its long-standing policy and a promise to customers that data would never be sold for any reason at any time. The Federal Trade Commission and the Attorneys General of 38 states fought against this proposal. The sale of this data was ultimately approved, albeit greatly reduced from what was initially proposed.

===General Wireless Operations, Inc.===
On March 31, 2015, the bankruptcy court approved a US$160 million offer by the Standard General affiliate General Wireless Operations, Inc., gaining ownership of 1,743 RadioShack locations. As part of the deal, the company entered into a partnership with Sprint, in which the company would become a co-tenant at 1,435 RadioShack locations and establish store within a store areas devoted to selling its wireless brands, including Sprint, Boost Mobile and Virgin Mobile. The stores would collect commissions on the sale of Sprint products, and Sprint would assist in promotion. Sprint stated that this arrangement would increase the company&#x27;s retail footprint by more than double; the company previously had around 1,100 company-owned retail outlets, in comparison to the over 2,000 run by AT&amp;T Mobility. Although they would be treated as a co-tenant, a mockup showed Sprint branding being more prominent in promotion and exterior signage than that of RadioShack. The acquisition did not include rights to RadioShack&#x27;s intellectual property (such as its trademarks), rights to RadioShack&#x27;s franchised locations, and customer records, which were to be sold separately.

Re-branded stores soft launched on April 10, 2015, with a preliminary conversion of the stores&#x27; existing wireless departments to exclusively house Sprint brands, with all stores eventually to be renovated in waves to allocate larger spaces for Sprint. In May 2015, the acquisition of the &quot;RadioShack&quot; name and its assets by General Wireless for US$26.2 million was finalized. Chief marketing officer Michael Tatelman emphasized that the company that emerged from the 2015 proceedings is an entirely new company, and went on to affirm that the old RadioShack did not re-emerge from bankruptcy, calling it &quot;defunct&quot;.

Less than one year after the bankruptcy events of 2015, Ron Garriques and Marty Amschler stepped down from their respective chief executive officer and chief financial officer positions; Garriques had held his position for nine months.

==== 2017 bankruptcy ====
It was speculated on March 2, 2017, that General Wireless was preparing to take RadioShack through its second bankruptcy in two years. This was evidenced when dozens of corporate office employees were laid off and two hundred stores were planned to be shuttered, and further evidenced when the RadioShack website began displaying &quot;all sales final&quot; banners for in-store purchases at all locations.

RadioShack&#x27;s Chapter 11 bankruptcy was formally filed on March 8, 2017. Of the then 1,300 remaining stores, several hundred were converted into Sprint-only locations.

Despite declaring Chapter 11 bankruptcy (typically reserved for reorganization of debt) instead of Chapter 7 (liquidation), the company engaged in liquidation of all inventory, supplies, and store fixtures, as well as auctioning off old memorabilia. On May 26, RadioShack announced plans to close all but 70 corporate stores and shift its business primarily to online. These stores closed after Memorial Day Weekend of 2017. Of the remaining stores, 50 more closed by the end of June 2017.

One particular store closing in April 2017 garnered widespread media attention when a Facebook account, calling itself &quot;RadioShack - Reynoldsburg, Ohio&quot;, began posting aggressive messages alluding to the bankruptcy, such as &quot;We closed. Fuck you all.&quot; RadioShack addressed these posts on their official Facebook page denying any involvement.

On June 29, 2017, RadioShack&#x27;s creditors sued Sprint, claiming that it sabotaged its co-branded locations with newly built Sprint retail stores—which were constructed near well-performing RadioShack locations as determined by confidential sales information. The suit argued that Sprint&#x27;s actions &quot;destroyed nearly 6,000 RadioShack jobs&quot;.

General Wireless announced plans on June 12, 2017, to auction off the RadioShack name and IP, with bidding to begin on July 18. Bidding concluded on July 19, 2017, when one of RadioShack&#x27;s creditors, Kensington Capital Holdings, obtained the RadioShack brand and other intellectual properties for US$15 million. Kensington was the sole bidder.

In October 2017, General Wireless officially exited bankruptcy and was allowed to retain the company&#x27;s warehouse, e-commerce site, dealer network operations, and up to 28 stores.

==== Post-bankruptcy ====
RadioShack began shrinking its U.S. headquarters operation in 2017. By September of that year,
it had a staff of 50 and moved to RadioShack&#x27;s distribution center on Terminal Road just north of the Fort Worth Stockyards.

In late July 2018, RadioShack partnered up with HobbyTown USA to open up around 100 RadioShack &quot;Express&quot; stores. HobbyTown owners select which RadioShack products to carry.

RadioShack dealerships had re-opened around 500 stores by October 2018. By November 2018, it had signed 77 of HobbyTown&#x27;s 137 franchise stores.

=== Retail Ecommerce Ventures (REV) ===
In November 2020, RadioShack&#x27;s intellectual property and its remaining operations—about 400 independent authorized dealers, about 80 Hobbytown USA affiliate stores, and its online sales operation—were purchased by Retail Ecommerce Ventures (REV), a Florida-based company that had previously purchased defunct retailers Pier 1 Imports, Dress Barn, Modell&#x27;s Sporting Goods, and Linens &#x27;n Things, along with The Franklin Mint.

In December 2021, REV announced they would use part of the brand name on a cryptocurrency platform called RadioShack DeFi (an abbreviation of decentralized finance). The platform would allow customers to exchange and freely swap existing cryptocurrency tokens for a token called $&quot;RADIO&quot; through the new platform.

The Twitter account for RadioShack gained notoriety in June 2022 when it began posting tweets with not safe for work content in an effort to attract attention towards its cryptocurrency platform, then renamed RadioShack Swap. The strategy, directed by chief marketing officer Ábel Czupor, received a mixed reaction among dealers; HobbyTown USA subsequently terminated its relationship with RadioShack in response to customer confusion surrounding the posts.

== Corporate headquarters ==
In the 1970s RadioShack had a new headquarters &quot;Tandy Towers&quot; built in downtown Fort Worth on Throckmorton Street. In 2001, RadioShack bought the former Ripley Arnold public housing complex in Downtown Fort Worth along the Trinity River for US$20 million. The company razed the complex and had a corporate headquarters campus built, after the City of Fort Worth approved a 30-year economic agreement to ensure that the company stayed in Fort Worth. RadioShack moved into the campus in 2005.

In 2009, with two years left on a rent-free lease of the building, the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; reported that the company was considering a new site for its headquarters. The &quot;Tampa Bay Business Journal&quot; reported rumors among Tampa Bay Area real estate brokers and developers that RadioShack might select Tampa as the site of its headquarters.

In 2010, however, RadioShack announced efforts to remain at its current site. The headquarters was ultimately reduced to a small group after the second bankruptcy filing. In September 2017, what was left of RadioShack (about 50 people) left the downtown location, moving to a warehouse on Terminal Road just north of &quot;The Stockyards&quot;.

== Non-US operations ==

=== InterTAN Inc. ===
In 1986, Tandy Corp. announced it would create a spinoff of its international retail operations, called InterTAN Inc. The new company would take over operations of over 2,000 international company-owned and franchised stores, while Tandy retained its 7,253 domestic outlets and 30 of its manufacturing facilities. InterTAN had two main units, Tandy Electronics Ltd., which operated in Canada, the UK, France, Belgium, West Germany, and the Netherlands; and Tandy Australia Ltd., which operated in Australia.

At the end of 1989, there were 1,417 stores operated by InterTAN under the Tandy or Radio Shack names. InterTAN operated Tandy or Radio Shack stores in the UK until 1999 and Australia until 2001. RadioShack branded merchandise accounted for 9.5% of InterTAN&#x27;s inventory purchases in its 2002–2003 fiscal year, the last complete year before the Circuit City acquisition, and later disappeared from stores entirely.

=== Canada ===
Following the creation of InterTAN, Tandy Electronics operated 873 stores in Canada, and owned the rights to the RadioShack name. In 2004, Circuit City purchased InterTAN, which held the rights to use the RadioShack name in Canada until 2010. Radio Shack Corp., which operated Radio Shack stores in the US, sued InterTAN in an attempt to end the contract for the company name early. On March 24, 2005, a US district court judge ruled in favour of RadioShack, requiring InterTAN stop using the brand name in products, packaging or advertising by June 30, 2005. The Canadian stores were rebranded under the name &quot;The Source by Circuit City&quot;. Radio Shack briefly re-entered the Canadian market, but eventually closed all stores to refocus attention on its core US business. 

The Source was acquired by BCE Inc. in 2009. In January 2024, Bell announced a brand licensing agreement with its competitor Best Buy, which will see its locations rebranded as Best Buy Express and integrated into Best Buy&#x27;s retail network, but remain under the ownership of BCE.

=== Asia ===
In March 2012, Malaysian company Berjaya Retail Berhad, entered into a franchising agreement with Radio Shack. Later that year, the company announced a second franchising deal with Chinese company, Cybermart.

Berjaya had six stores in Malaysia before it quietly ceased operations in 2017.

=== Mexico ===

In 1986, Grupo Gigante signed a deal with Tandy Corporation to operate Radio Shack branded stores in Mexico. After growing their electronics chain within Mexico to 24 stores, Grupo Gigante signed a new deal with Tandy in 1992 to form a new joint ventured called Radio Shack de México

in which both companies had an equal share. As part of the deal, Grupo Gigante transferred their electronics stores to Radio Shack de México.

In 2008, Grupo Gigante separated from Radio Shack, (then renamed Radio Shack Corporation) and sold its share of the joint venture to Radio Shack Corp. for $42.3 million.

In June 2015, Grupo Gigante repurchased 100 percent of RadioShack de Mexico, including stores, warehouses, and all related brand names and intellectual properties for use within Mexico, from the US Bankruptcy Court in Delaware for US$31.5 million. The chain had 247 stores in Mexico at the time of the sale. Following the sale, all Radio Shack stores, warehouses, brands, assets, and related trademarks in Mexico are currently owned by RadioShack de México S.A. de C.V., a subsidiary of Grupo Gigante.

A major Mexican news magazine had reported in March 2015 that Grupo Gigante actually purchased 100% of the stock in RadioShack de México from RadioShack Corporation for US$31.8 million, two months prior to the bankruptcy filing, but had only had to hand over US$11.8 million to RadioShack Corp. for also assuming approximately US$20 million in debt liabilities.

While Radio Shack was facing a second bankruptcy in the United States, Grupo Gigante announced in October 2017 that they planned to expand the Radio Shack brand within Mexico by opening eight more stores.

=== Latin America &amp; the Caribbean ===



When Radio Shack Corporation filed for bankruptcy the first time in 2015, the Unicomer Group (Grupo Unicomer) purchased the Radio Shack brand from the bankruptcy court for its exclusive use in Latin America and the Caribbean, except Mexico. Unicomer, through its corporate parent Regal Forest Holding Co. Ltd., paid $5 million for the brand.

The company&#x27;s relationship with Radio Shack dated back to 1998, when Unicomer opened its first Radio Shack franchise store in El Salvador. It later expanded into Honduras, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. By January 2015, Unicomer had 57 Radio Shack stores distributed throughout four countries within Central America.

In April 2015, Unicomer began receiving franchise payments from franchises in several countries that Unicomer had not previously had a business presence in. It expanded into Trinidad in 2016, Jamaica in 2017, Barbados in 2017, and Guyana in 2017.

By the end of 2017, Unicomer had company-owned stores located in the countries of Barbados, El Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Jamaica, Nicaragua, and Trinidad while receiving franchise payments from independent franchised stores located in the countries of Antigua, Aruba, Costa Rica, Paraguay and Peru in which Unicomer did not have a business presence in. Since 2014, the independent company Coolbox is an authorized dealer for RadioShack products in Peru.

In April 2018, the RadioShack brand returned to Bolivia when franchisee Cosworld Trading opened two franchised stores for Unicomer in the capital city of La Paz. The previous RadioShack stores had closed in 2015 as a result of RadioShack first bankruptcy filing.

=== Middle East ===

When Radio Shack filed for bankruptcy the first time in 2015, the Egypt-based Delta RS for Trading purchased the Radio Shack brand from the bankruptcy court for its exclusive use in Middle East and North Africa for $US5 million.

Delta RS for Trading, as Radio Shack Egypt, had opened its first Radio Shack franchised store in 1998 in Nasr City. By March 2003, Radio Shack Egypt had 65 company-operated stores plus 15 sub-franchised stores. In 2017, the Egyptian government accused Radio Shack Egypt and its parent Delta RS in aiding the Muslim Brotherhood.

== Other operations ==
=== Corporate citizenship ===
In 2006, RadioShack supported the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children by providing store presence for the StreetSentz program, a child identification and educational kit offered to families without charge. RadioShack supported United Way of America Charities to assist their Oklahoma and Texas relief efforts after the 2013 Moore tornado. RadioShack&#x27;s green initiative promotes the Rechargeable Battery Recycling Corporation, which accepts end-of-life rechargeable batteries and wireless phones dropped off in-store to be safely recycled.

=== Other retailer partnerships ===
In August 2001, RadioShack opened kiosk-style stores inside Blockbuster outlets, only to abandon the project in February 2002; CEO Len Roberts announced that the stores did not meet expectations.

RadioShack operated wireless kiosks within 417 Sam&#x27;s Club discount warehouses from 2004 to 2011. The kiosk operations, purchased from Arizona-based Wireless Retail Inc, operated as a subsidiary, SC Kiosks Inc., with employees contracted through RadioShack Corporation. No RadioShack-branded merchandise was sold. The kiosks closed in 2011, costing RadioShack an estimated US$10–15 million in 2011 operating income.

RadioShack then attempted a joint venture with Target to deploy mobile telephone kiosks in 1,490 Target stores by April 2011. In April 2013, RadioShack&#x27;s partnership with Target ended and the Target Mobile in-store kiosks were turned over to a new partnership with Brightstar and MarketSource.

==== No-contract wireless ====

On September 5, 2012, RadioShack in a partnership with Cricket Wireless, began offering its own branded no-contract wireless services using Cricket and Sprint&#x27;s nationwide networks. The service was discontinued on August 7, 2014; clients who had already purchased the service from RadioShack continue to receive service from Cricket Wireless.

=== Cycling team sponsorship ===

In 2009, the company became the main sponsor of a new cycling team, Team RadioShack, with Lance Armstrong and Johan Bruyneel. RadioShack featured Armstrong in a number of television commercials and advertising campaigns. RadioShack came under fire for having Armstrong as a spokesperson in 2011, when allegations that the cyclist had used performance-enhancing drugs surfaced.

== Lawsuits ==

In September 1999, AutoZone, Inc., sued Tandy Corp., then the owner of RadioShack, in a federal district court in Tennessee for infringing the AutoZone trademark by using the name &quot;PowerZone&quot; for a section in RadioShack&#x27;s retail stores. In November 2001, the district court granted Tandy&#x27;s motion for summary judgment to dismiss the case, finding that AutoZone failed to prove that the use of &quot;PowerZone&quot; infringed the &quot;AutoZone&quot; trademark. AutoZone appealed that decision. In June 2004, the federal court of appeals affirmed the district court&#x27;s dismissal of the case.

In June 2011, a customer sued Sprint and RadioShack after finding pornography on their newly purchased cell phones.

In 2012, a Denver jury awarded $674,938 to David Nelson, a 25-year RadioShack employee who had been fired in retaliation for complaining about age discrimination.

In 2013, a federal jury awarded over $1 million in an age discrimination suit to a longtime RadioShack store manager who was fired in 2010 from the San Francisco store he had managed since 1998.

In July 2014, in &quot;Verderame v. RadioShack Corp.,&quot; the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania found that RadioShack owed its store managers in Pennsylvania a possible US$5.8 million for unpaid overtime.

== In popular culture ==
*In the 1980 film &quot;Used Cars&quot;, an electronics engineer needs equipment to do some last-minute repairs to a bootleg microwave transmitter, and says to his partner, &quot;RadioShack closes in half an hour.&quot;
*A &quot;Radio Shock&quot; store (owned by the &quot;Tandy Corporation&quot;) appeared in the original 1991 release of &quot;Space Quest IV&quot;, displaced by &quot;Hz. So Good&quot; in later editions because of threats of legal action by Tandy.
*RadioShack is featured prominently in &quot;Short Circuit 2&quot;, which serves as a &quot;clinic&quot; for Johnny 5 while he repairs himself after being assaulted by thieves.
*RadioShack is mentioned and briefly featured on the pilot episode of &quot;Young Sheldon&quot;. Visits to RadioShack are a frequent plot point in the &quot;Young Sheldon&quot; series, building off allusions to childhood visits made by the character Sheldon Cooper in its parent series, &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;. The family returns to the RadioShack store in a later episode, where his mother purchases him a Tandy 1000.
*RadioShack appears in the second season of the Netflix series &quot;Stranger Things&quot; as the workplace of Bob Newby. In one scene, an Armatron (a product actually sold at RadioShack during that period) can be seen on a shelf above his head.
*In the 2001 re-make of the 1960 movie &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot;, after Livingston asks an FBI agent to not touch his equipment by asking, &quot;Do you see me grabbing the gun out of your holster and waving it around?&quot;, the agent retorts with &quot;Hey &#x27;RadioShack&#x27;, relax&quot;.
*American sportswriter and YouTuber Jon Bois worked at RadioShack sometime in the early to mid 2000s, later publishing multiple articles detailing his personal experiences as an employee.

<doc id="327614" wikidata="Q33997" url="?curid=327614" title="Sindhi language">
<text>Sindhi ( ; or , ) is an Indo-Aryan language spoken by about 30 million people in the Pakistani province of Sindh, where it has official status. It is also spoken by a further 1.7 million people in India, where it is a scheduled language, without any state-level official status. The main writing system is the Perso-Arabic script, which accounts for the majority of the Sindhi literature and is the only one currently used in Pakistan. In India, both the Perso-Arabic script and Devanagari are used.

Sindhi is first mentioned in historical records within the &quot;Nātyaśāstra&quot;, a text thought to have been composed between 200 BC and 200 AD. The earliest written evidence of Sindhi as a language can be found in a translation of the Qur’an into Sindhi dating back to 883 AD. Sindhi was one of the first Indo-Aryan languages to encounter influence from Persian and Arabic following the Umayyad conquest in 712 AD. A substantial body of Sindhi literature developed during the Medieval period, the most famous of which is the religious and mystic poetry of Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai from the 18th century. Modern Sindhi was promoted under British rule beginning in 1843, which led to the current status of the language in independent Pakistan after 1947.

==History==
===Origins===
The name &quot;Sindhi&quot; is derived from the Sanskrit &quot;síndhu&quot;, the original name of the Indus River, along whose delta Sindhi is spoken.

Like other languages of the Indo-Aryan family, Sindhi is descended from Old Indo-Aryan (Sanskrit) via Middle Indo-Aryan (Pali, secondary Prakrits, and Apabhramsha). 20th century Western scholars such as George Abraham Grierson believed that Sindhi descended specifically from the Vrācaḍa dialect of Apabhramsha (described by Markandeya as being spoken in &quot;Sindhu-deśa&quot;, corresponding to modern Sindh) but later work has shown this to be unlikely.

===Early Sindhi (2nd–16th centuries)===
Literary attestation of early Sindhi is sparse. Sindhi is first mentioned in historical records within the Nātyaśāstra, a text on dramaturgy thought to have been composed between 200 B.C. and 200 A.D. The earliest written evidence of Sindhi as a language can be found in a translation of the Qur’an into Sindhi dating back to 883 A.D. Historically, Isma&#x27;ili religious literature and poetry in India, as old as the 11th century CE, used a language that was closely related to Sindhi and Gujarati. Much of this work is in the form of ginans (a kind of devotional hymn).

Sindhi was the first Indo-Aryan language to be in close contact with Arabic and Persian following the Umayyad conquest of Sindh in 712 CE.

===Medieval Sindhi (16th–19th centuries)===
Medieval Sindhi literature is of a primarily religious genre, comprising a syncretic Sufi and Advaita Vedanta poetry, the latter in the devotional bhakti tradition. The earliest known Sindhi poet of the Sufi tradition is Qazi Qadan (1493–1551). Other early poets were Shah Inat Rizvi ( 1613–1701) and Shah Abdul Karim Bulri (1538–1623). These poets had a mystical bent that profoundly influenced Sindhi poetry for much of this period.

Another famous part of Medieval Sindhi literature is a wealth of folktales, adapted and readapted into verse by many bards at various times and possibly much older than their earliest literary attestations. These include romantic epics such as Sassui Punnhun, Sohni Mahiwal, Momal Rano, Noori Jam Tamachi, Lilan Chanesar, and others.

The greatest poet of Sindhi was Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai (1689/1690–1752), whose verses were compiled into the Shah Jo Risalo by his followers. While primarily Sufi, his verses also recount traditional Sindhi folktales and aspects of the cultural history of Sindh.

The first attested Sindhi translation of the Quran was done by Akhund Azaz Allah Muttalawi (1747–1824) and published in Gujarat in 1870. The first to appear in print was by Muhammad Siddiq in 1867.

===Modern Sindhi (1843–present)===

In 1843, the British conquest of Sindh led the region to become part of the Bombay Presidency. Soon after, in 1848, Governor George Clerk established Sindhi as the official language in the province, removing the literary dominance of Persian. Sir Bartle Frere, the then commissioner of Sindh, issued orders on August 29, 1857, advising civil servants in Sindh to pass an examination in Sindhi. He also ordered the use of Sindhi in official documents. In 1868, the Bombay Presidency assigned &quot;Narayan Jagannath Vaidya&quot; to replace the Abjad used in Sindhi with the &quot;Khudabadi script&quot;. The script was decreed a standard script by the Bombay Presidency thus inciting anarchy in the Muslim majority region. A powerful unrest followed, after which Twelve Martial Laws were imposed by the British authorities. The granting of official status of Sindhi along with script reforms ushered in the development of modern Sindhi literature.

The first printed works in Sindhi were produced at the Muhammadi Press in Bombay beginning in 1867. These included Islamic stories set in verse by Muhammad Hashim Thattvi, one of the renowned religious scholars of Sindh.

The Partition of India in 1947 resulted in most Sindhi speakers ending up in the new state of Pakistan, commencing a push to establish a strong sub-national linguistic identity for Sindhi. This manifested in resistance to the imposition of Urdu and eventually Sindhi nationalism in the 1980s.

The language and literary style of contemporary Sindhi writings in Pakistan and India were noticeably diverging by the late 20th century; authors from the former country were borrowing extensively from Urdu, while those from the latter were highly influenced by Hindi.

==Geographic distribution==
In Pakistan, Sindhi is the first language of 30.26 million people, or % of the country&#x27;s population as of the 2017 census. 29.5 million of these are found in Sindh, where they account for % of the total population of the province. There are 0.56 million speakers in the province of Balochistan, especially in the Kacchi Plain that encompasses the districts of Lasbela, Hub, Kachhi, Sibi, Sohbatpur, Jafarabad, Jhal Magsi, Usta Muhammad and Nasirabad.

In India, Sindhi mother tongue speakers were distributed in the following states: 
==Official status==
Sindhi is the official language of the Pakistani province of Sindh and one of the scheduled languages of India, where it does not have any state-level status.

Prior to the inception of Pakistan, Sindhi was the national language of Sindh. 
The Pakistan Sindh Assembly has ordered compulsory teaching of the Sindhi language in all private schools in Sindh. According to the Sindh Private Educational Institutions Form B (Regulations and Control) 2005 Rules, &quot;All educational institutions are required to teach children the Sindhi language. Sindh Education and Literacy Minister, Syed Sardar Ali Shah, and Secretary of School Education, Qazi Shahid Pervaiz, have ordered the employment of Sindhi teachers in all private schools in Sindh so that this language can be easily and widely taught. Sindhi is taught in all provincial private schools that follow the Matric system and not the ones that follow the Cambridge system.

At the occasion of &#x27;Mother Language Day&#x27; in 2023, the Sindh Assembly under Culture minister Sardar Ali Shah, passed a unanimous resolution to extend the use of language to primary level and increase the status of Sindhi as a national language of Pakistan.

The Indian Government has legislated Sindhi as a scheduled language in India, making it an option for education. Despite lacking any state-level status, Sindhi is still a prominent minority language in the Indian state of Rajasthan.

There are many Sindhi language television channels broadcasting in Pakistan such as Time News, KTN, Sindh TV, Awaz Television Network, Mehran TV, and Dharti TV.

==Dialects==

Sindhi has many dialects, and forms a dialect continuum at some places with neighboring languages such as Saraiki and Gujarati. Some of the documented dialects of Sindhi are:

* Vicholi: The prestige dialect spoken around Hyderabad and central Sindh (the &quot;Vicholo&quot; region). The literary standard of Sindhi is based on this dialect.
* Uttaradi: The dialect of northern Sindh (&quot;Uttaru&quot;, meaning &quot;north&quot;), with minor differences in Larkana, Shikarpur and in parts of Sukkur and Kandiaro.
* Lari: The dialect of southern Sindh (&quot;Lāṛu&quot;) spoken around areas like Karachi, Thatta, Sujawal, Tando Muhammad Khan and Badin districts.
* Siroli/Siraiki or Ubheji: The dialect of northernmost Sindh (&quot;Siro&quot;, meaning &quot;head&quot;). Spoken in smaller number all over Sindh but mainly in Jacobabad and Kashmore districts, it has little similarity with the Saraiki language of South Punjab and has variously been treated either as a dialect of Saraiki or as a dialect of Sindhi.
* Lasi: The dialect of Lasbela, Hub and Gwadar districts in Balochistan, closely related to Lari and Vicholi, and in contact with Balochi.
* Firaqi Sindhi: The dialect of the Kachhi plains the north eastern districts of Balochistan, where it is referred to as Firaqi Sindhi or commonly just Sindhi.
* Thareli: also called Tharechi dialect, spoken in north eastern Thar Desert of Sindh, called Nara desert (Achhro thar), but mainly spoken in the western part of Jaisalmer district of Rajasthan, India by many Sindhi Muslims.
* Sindhi Bhili: It is a dialect spoken in Sindh by the Sindhi Meghwars and Bheels. Sindhi Bhil is known to have many old Sindhi words, which were lost after Arabic, Persian, and Chaghatai influence.

The variety of Sindhi spoken by Sindhi Hindus who emigrated to India is known as Dukslinu Sindhi. Furthermore, Kutchi and Jadgali are sometimes classified as dialects of Sindhi rather than independent languages.

== Phonology ==
Sindhi has a relatively large inventory of both consonants and vowels compared to other Indo-Aryan languages. Sindhi has 46 consonant phonemes and 10 vowels. The consonant to vowel ratio is around average for the world&#x27;s languages at 2.8. All plosives, affricates, nasals, the retroflex flap, and the lateral approximant /l/ have aspirated or breathy voiced counterparts. The language also features four implosives.

=== Consonants ===

The retroflex consonants are apical postalveolar and do not involve curling back of the tip of the tongue, so they could be transcribed in phonetic transcription. The affricates are laminal post-alveolars with a relatively short release. It is not clear if is similar, or truly palatal. is realized as labiovelar or labiodental in free variation, but is not common, except before a stop.

=== Vowels ===
The vowels are modal length and short . Consonants following short vowels are lengthened: &#x27;leaf&#x27; vs. &#x27;worn&#x27;.

== Grammar ==

===Nouns===
Sindhi nouns distinguish two genders (masculine and feminine), two numbers (singular and plural), and five cases (nominative, vocative, oblique, ablative, and locative). This is a similar paradigm to Punjabi. Almost all Sindhi noun stems end in a vowel, except for some recent loanwords. The declension of a noun in Sindhi is largely determined from its grammatical gender and the final vowel (or if there is no final vowel). Generally, &quot;-o&quot; stems are masculine and &quot;-a&quot; stems are feminine, but the other final vowels can belong to either gender.

The different paradigms are listed below with examples. The ablative and locative cases are used with only some lexemes in the singular number and hence not listed, but predictably take the suffixes &quot;-ā̃&quot; / &quot;-aū̃&quot; / &quot;-ū̃&quot; () and &quot;-i&quot; ().

A few nouns representing familial relations take irregular declensions with an extension in &quot;-r-&quot; in the plural. These are the masculine nouns &quot;bhāu&quot; &quot;brother&quot;, &quot;pīu&quot; &quot;father&quot;, and the feminine nouns &quot;dhīa&quot; &quot;daughter&quot;, &quot;nū̃hã&quot; &quot;daughter-in-law&quot;, &quot;bheṇa&quot; &quot;sister&quot;, &quot;māu&quot; &quot;mother&quot;, and &quot;joi&quot; &quot;wife&quot;.

===Pronouns===

====Personal pronouns====
Like other Indo-Aryan languages, Sindhi has first and second-person personal pronouns as well as several types of third-person proximal and distal demonstratives. These decline in the nominative and oblique cases. The genitive is a special form for the first and second-person singular, but formed as usual with the oblique and case marker جو &quot;jo&quot; for the rest. The personal pronouns are listed below.

The third-person pronouns are listed below. Besides the unmarked demonstratives, there are also &quot;specific&quot; and &quot;present&quot; demonstratives. In the nominative singular, the demonstratives are marked for gender. Some other pronouns which decline identically to &quot;ko&quot; &quot;someone&quot; are &quot;har-ko&quot; &quot;everyone&quot;, &quot;sabh-ko&quot; &quot;all of them&quot;, &quot;je-ko&quot; &quot;whoever&quot; (relative), and &quot;te-ko&quot; &quot;that one&quot; (correlative).

===Numerals===
===Postpositions===
Most nominal relations (e.g. the semantic role of a nominal as an argument to a verb) are indicated using postpositions, which follow a noun in the oblique case. The subject of the verb takes the bare oblique case, while the object may be in nominative case or in oblique case and followed by the accusative case marker کي &quot;khe&quot;.

The postpositions are divided into case markers, which directly follow the noun, and complex postpositions, which combine with a case marker (usually the genitive جو &quot;jo&quot;).

====Case markers====
The case markers are listed below.

The postpositions with the suffix &quot;-o&quot; decline in gender and number to agree with their governor, e.g. &quot;chokiro j-o pīu&quot; &quot;the boy&#x27;s father&quot; but &quot;chokiro j-ī māu&quot; &quot;the boy&#x27;s mother&quot;.

There are several ablative case markers formed from the spatial postpositions and the ablative ending &quot;-ā̃&quot;. These indicate complex motion such as &quot;from inside of&quot;.

Finally, some case markers are found in medieval Sindhi literature and/or modern poetic Sindhi, and otherwise not used in standard speech.

====Complex postpositions====
The complex postpositions are formed with a case marker, usually the genitive but sometimes the ablative. Many are listed below.

=== Vocabulary ===
According to historian Nabi Bux Baloch, most Sindhi vocabulary is from ancient Sanskrit. However, owing to the influence of the Persian language over the subcontinent, Sindhi has adapted many words from Persian and Arabic. It has also borrowed from English and Hindustani. Today, Sindhi in Pakistan is slightly influenced by Urdu, with more borrowed Perso-Arabic elements, while Sindhi in India is influenced by Hindi, with more borrowed tatsam Sanskrit elements.

==Writing systems==
Sindhis in Pakistan use a version of the Perso-Arabic script with new letters adapted to Sindhi phonology, while in India a greater variety of scripts are in use, including Devanagari, Khudabadi, Khojki, and Gurmukhi. Perso-Arabic for Sindhi was also made digitally accessible relatively earlier.

The earliest attested records in Sindhi are from the 15th century. Before the standardisation of Sindhi orthography, numerous forms of Devanagari and Laṇḍā scripts were used for trading. For literary and religious purposes, a Perso-Arabic script developed by Abul-Hasan as-Sindi and Gurmukhi (a subset of Laṇḍā) were used. Another two scripts, Khudabadi and Shikarpuri, were reforms of the Landa script. During British rule in the late 19th century, the Perso-Arabic script was decreed standard over Devanagari.

=== Perso-Arabic script ===

During the British Raj, a variant of the Persian alphabet was adopted for Sindhi in the 19th century. The script is used in Pakistan and India today. It has a total of 52 letters, augmenting the Persian with digraphs and eighteen new letters () for sounds particular to Sindhi and other Indo-Aryan languages. Some letters that are distinguished in Arabic or Persian are homophones in Sindhi.

Below table presents Sindhi Perso-Arabic alphabet. Letters shaded in yellow are solely used in writing of loanwords, and the phoneme they represent are also represented by other letters in the alphabet. Letters and digraphs shaded in green aren&#x27;t usually considered as part of the base alphabet. They are either commonly used digraphs representing aspirated consonants, or are ligatures serving a grammatical function. These ligatures include the , which is pronounced as [ãĩ̯] and represents &quot;and&quot;, and the , which is pronounced as [mẽ] and it creates a locative relationship between words.

The orthography of the letter &quot;hāʾ&quot; in Sindhi, especially as it comes to typing as opposed to handwriting, has been a source of confusion for many. Especially because whereas in Arabic and Persian, there exists one single letter for &quot;hāʾ&quot;, in Urdu, the letter has diverged into two distinct variants: &quot;gol he&quot; (&quot;round he&quot;) and &quot;do-cašmi he&quot; (&quot;two-eyed he&quot;). The former is written is written round and zigzagged as &quot;&quot;, and can impart the &quot;h&quot; () sound anywhere in a word, or the long &quot;a&quot; or the &quot;e&quot; vowels ( or ) at the end of a word. The latter is written in Arabic Naskh style (as a loop) () , in order to be used in digraphs and to create the aspirate consonants.

For most aspirated consonants, Sindhi relies on unique letters as opposed to the Urdu practice of digraphs. However, this doesn&#x27;t apply to all aspirated consonants. Some are still written as digraphs. The letter &quot;hāʾ&quot; is also used in Sindhi to represent the sound [h] in native Sindhi words, in Arabic and Persian loanwords, and to represent vowels ( or ) at the end of the word. The notations and conventions in Sindhi are different from either Persian or Arabic and from Urdu. Given the variety of the types of &quot;hāʾ&quot; across these languages for which Unicode characters have been designed, in order for the letters to be displayed correctly when typing, a correct and consistent convention needs to be followed. The following table will present these in detail.

The punctuation of Sindhi Perso-Arabic script differs slightly from that of Urdu, Persian, and Arabic. Namely, instead of using the typical &quot;inverted comma&quot; ( U+060C]) common in these mentioned alphabet, a &quot;reversed comma&quot; ( U+2E41]) is used. Although many documents do indeed incorrectly use Urdu punctuations.


===Devanagari script ===
In India, the Devanagari script is also used to write Sindhi. A modern version was introduced by the government of India in 1948; however, it did not gain full acceptance, so both the Sindhi-Arabic and Devanagari scripts are used. In India, a person may write a Sindhi language paper for a Civil Services Examination in either script. Devanagari was seen as the most practical option for Sindhi language in India. Diacritical bars below the letter are used to mark implosive consonants, and dots called &quot;nukta&quot; are used to form other additional consonants.
===Laṇḍā scripts===
Laṇḍā-based scripts, such as Gurmukhi, Khojki, and the Khudabadi script were used historically to write Sindhi.

====Khudabadi====
The Khudabadi alphabet was invented in 1550 CE, and was used alongside other scripts by the Hindu community until the colonial era, where the sole usage of the Arabic script for official purposes was legislated.

The script continued to be used on a smaller scale by the trader community until the Partition of India in 1947.


====Khojki====
Khojki was employed primarily to record Muslim Shia Ismaili religious literature, as well as literature for a few secret Shia Muslim sects.
====Gurmukhi====
The Gurmukhi script was also used to write Sindhi, mainly in India by Hindus.

=== Roman Sindhi ===

The Sindhi-Roman script or Roman-Sindhi script is the contemporary Sindhi script usually used by the Sindhis when texting messages on their mobile phones.

== Advocacy ==
In 1972, an bill was passed by the provincial assembly of Sindh which saw Sindhi, given official status thus becoming the first provincial language in Pakistan to have its own official status.
* Sindhi language was made the official language of Sindh according to Language Bill.
* All Educational institutes in Sindh are mandated to teach Sindhi as per the bill.

=== Software ===
By 2001, Abdul-Majid Bhurgri had coordinated with Microsoft to develop Unicode-based Software in the form of the Perso-Arabic Sindhi script which afterwards became the basis for the communicated use by Sindhi speakers around the world. In 2016, Google introduced the first automated translator for Sindhi language. Later on in 2023 an offline support was introduced by Google Translate. Which was followed by Microsoft Translator strengthening support in May of same year.

In June 2014, the Khudabadi script of the Sindhi language was added to Unicode, However as of now the script currently has no proper rendering support to view it in unsupported devices.

<text>Vacuum Diagrams is a collection of science fiction short stories by British writer Stephen Baxter. The collection connects the novels of the Xeelee Sequence and also shows the history of mankind in the Xeelee universe, and ultimately the universe. While each short story in the collection is self-contained, the stories are presented as being contained in the context of the first story, &quot;Eve&quot;, about a man (seemingly Jack Raoul from the portion of the timeline concerned with the Silver Ghosts) who is forced to witness the events in the short stories by a god-like being. &quot;Eve&quot; acts as a structure for the short stories, with an introduction at the beginning of &quot;Vacuum Diagrams&quot;, short scenes occurring between each &quot;era&quot; (with &quot;Eve&quot; character explaining and introducing the next section), and an ending that wraps up the plot for the &quot;Eve&quot; story itself. &quot;Vacuum Diagrams&quot; won the Philip K. Dick Award in 1999.

At the end of the collection, a chronology of the Xeelee Sequence is provided. Every short story and book from the cycle (up to 1997) is noted, with notable events from each story plotted.

&quot;Vacuum Diagrams&quot; is also the title of the fifteenth short story in this collection. It was originally published in &quot;Interzone&quot; in 1990. The title &quot;Vacuum Diagrams&quot; refers to the violation and reassertion of the uncertainty principle in our universe. Set in A.D. 21124, the story concerns the main character&#x27;s attempt and failure to terraform a colony due to its upset of the agenda of the galactic-scale builders known as the Xeelee.

<text>Searchlight is a British magazine, founded in 1975 by Gerry Gable and Maurice Ludmer, which publishes exposés about racism, antisemitism and fascism in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.

&quot;Searchlight&quot;&#x27;s main focus is on the far right in the United Kingdom, as well as covering similar entities in other countries. The magazine is published and edited by Gerry Gable. An archive of historical materials associated with the magazine, The Searchlight Archive, is housed at the University of Northampton.

The magazine is published quarterly, but it will cease paper publication after the Spring 2025 issue, the 50th anniversary of it being in print. Investigations and reporting will continue online.

==History==
The current &quot;Searchlight&quot; magazine was preceded by a newspaper of the same name, which was founded in 1964 by left-wing Labour Party Member of Parliament Reg Freeson with Gerry Gable as &quot;research director&quot;. In 1967, in the fourth issue of the paper, Freeson announced his decision to stand down as editor after being promoted to a ministerial role in the UK government. He said that fellow MP Joan Lestor would be taking over as editor, but no further issues were actually published. However, Gable, Maurice Ludmer and others stayed together as Searchlight Associates. In 1974 they published the pamphlet &#x27;A Well Oiled Nazi Machine&#x27;, in response to the rise of the National Front. This brought renewed attention to the group, and helped raise funds to establish a monthly magazine in 1975. The pilot issue of the new Searchlight appeared in February 1975, with Ludmer as Managing Editor and Gable as Editor.

Ludmer and Gable were also amongst the first sponsors of the Anti-Nazi League, with Ludmer sitting on its first steering group.

In the Ludmer years, &quot;Searchlight&quot; had a close relationship with &quot;CARF&quot;, the Campaign Against Racism and Fascism, a magazine published by the (London) Anti Racist-Anti Fascist Co-ordinating Committee (a Federation of the Anti-Fascist Committees that had sprung up all over London in the mid-1970s). &quot;CARF&quot; merged with &quot;Searchlight&quot; in 1979, becoming an insert (with separate editorial control) at the back of the magazine, but this arrangement ended following disagreements in the early 1990s. When &quot;CARF&quot; launched its own separate magazine, it led the first issue with a statement explaining the split from &quot;Searchlight&quot;. This centred on &quot;CARF&quot; being unhappy that &quot;Searchlight&quot; was, in its view, over-focused on antisemitism and not focused enough on anti-black racism.

After Ludmer&#x27;s early death in 1981, British academic Vron Ware briefly took over the editorial role until 1983. Following this Gable returned as editor, in a role he held until 1999.

The British National Party made a complaint to the Charity Commission of England and Wales about &quot;Searchlight&quot; and the associated Searchlight Educational Trust. The two anti-fascist bodies were investigated as it had been claimed that the Educational Trust had been engaging in political activity incompatible with its charitable status.

The Commission&#x27;s report stated that, in its opinion, the Searchlight Educational Trust had gone beyond the Commission&#x27;s guidelines on political activities. The charity agreed to follow the Commission&#x27;s recommendations after the complaint was upheld in 2003 with the Commission deciding that there was a need for a greater distinction between the public activities of &quot;Searchlight&quot; magazine and the educational trust. No action was taken against Searchlight.

Consequently, Searchlight divided into three main bodies: &quot;Searchlight&quot; magazine, the monthly anti-fascist and anti-racist magazine; Searchlight Information Services (SIS), a research and investigatory body which briefs governments, politicians, journalists, and the police; and, finally, Searchlight Educational Trust (SET), a charity devoted to challenging and defeating the extremism, racism and fascism. SIS and SET later joined the Hope not Hate campaign, and are no longer associated with &quot;Searchlight&quot; magazine.

Since &quot;Searchlight&quot; split with Hope not Hate in September 2011, &quot;Searchlight&quot; has opposed co-operation with the state.

Larry O&#x27;Hara commented in a book on political organisations published in 1994:
==Criticism==
In his history of Anti-Fascist Action (AFA), author Sean Birchall includes several instances of what AFA considered questionable tactics by &quot;Searchlight&quot;. In the 1990s, Direct Action Movement, which had been part of AFA, was among the first to criticise &quot;Searchlight&quot;&#x27;s motives and tactics.

Also, in 1984, editor Gerry Gable was commissioned by the BBC to provide research materials for a &quot;Panorama&quot; programme, &quot;Maggie&#x27;s Militant Tendency&quot;. The episode was to focus on a claim of right-wing extremism in the Conservative Party. Gable asserted that his research drew upon the information previously published in &quot;Searchlight&quot;. In response to the claims by Gable that two Conservative Party figures, Neil Hamilton and Gerald Howarth, were secret extremist Nazi supporters, actions for libel were brought against the BBC and Gable. The programme had alleged (not admitted as evidence in court) that Hamilton gave a Nazi salute in Berlin while &#x27;messing around&#x27; on a Parliamentary visit in August 1983. &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that &quot;Writing for the Sunday Times after the collapse of the case, he admitted he did give a little salute with two fingers to his nose to give the impression of a toothbrush moustache. &quot;Somebody on the trip clearly did not share our sense of humour,&quot; he wrote.&quot; The BBC capitulated on 21 October, and paid the pair&#x27;s legal costs. Hamilton and Howarth were awarded £20,000 each, and in the next edition of &quot;Panorama&quot;, on 27 October, the BBC made an unreserved apology to both. The case against Gable was dropped.

Gable is known to have links with MI5. His leaked 1977 London Weekend Television memo stated that he had &quot;given names I have acquired to be checked out by British/French security services&quot;. A 1987 profile referred to Gable&#x27;s &quot;wide range of contacts, including people in the secret services&quot;.

==Relations with other anti-fascist groups==
The magazine has hostile relations with some other anti-fascist groups in Britain. The magazine group was originally part of the steering committee of Unite Against Fascism and resigned their position after differences over tactics. 

Sonia Gable wrote critical articles on her blog about &quot;Searchlight&#x27;s&quot; former creation, Hope not Hate, a highly visible civil rights campaign from which it split in late 2011.

Despite this, &quot;Searchlight&quot; maintains friendly relationships with other groups, such as Australia&#x27;s FightDemBack and some other groups.

==Informants==
&quot;Searchlight&quot; relies for its material on those involved in the far right. This includes a range of infiltrators, defectors and casual informers. The best-known defectors were Ray Hill, and Matthew Collins, now of the Hope not Hate campaign.

In 2013 it was revealed that BNP member Duncan Robertson had been a &quot;Searchlight&quot; informer, in particular of the New Right group.

==Campaigns==

In the early years of the 21st century, &quot;Searchlight&quot; launched two interlinked anti-BNP and anti-racism campaigns, Stop the BNP and Hope not Hate. Hope not Hate received endorsement and national publicity from the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; newspaper, and revolved around an annual two week bus tour in the run-up to local elections.

In the 2010 general election campaign, SIS spent in excess of £319,000, primarily targeting the BNP.

Since &quot;Searchlight&quot; split from Hope not Hate, it has concentrated on publishing the results of its investigation, research and intelligence gathering and supporting direct action against fascist demonstrations, such as those of the English Defence League in Walthamstow on 1 September 2012 and Chelmsford on 18 August 2012. As well as articles exposing the BNP, EDL and the moves towards the formation of a new party spearheaded by the former BNP MEP and veteran fascist Andrew Brons, &quot;Searchlight&quot; has focused on the areas where the far right and Conservative ultra right meet, such as the Traditional Britain Group, and the New Right, the powerhouse of far-right ideological development.

==Arts==
&quot;Searchlight&quot; has a long-standing affiliation with the arts, which was strongly championed by former editor Maurice Ludmer. In the past this included a regular monthly column &quot;What their papers say&quot; which took a satirical look at the current political landscape.

&quot;Searchlight&quot; runs regular benefit events which feature the work of folk singers, poets and other arts professionals. On 6 January 2014 it launched a new arts section on its website. This opened with the fictional diary of Greg Goode, a US national recently moved to London in search of the truth. The column, which runs monthly, features a bizarre blend of rhyming poetry, hyperbolic narrative and song.

In the Autumn of 2014 &quot;Searchlight&quot; launched a standalone online arts magazine called &quot;Searchlight Magazine Arts&quot; The site contains interviews, articles, songs, fiction and documentaries, and celebrates the diverse arts movement in the UK and further afield. The aim of the magazine is to tell the arts stories no one else is telling and to put a wry slant on a range of unusual topics and causes.

== Archive ==
In 2012, &quot;Searchlight&quot; magazine partnered with the University of Northampton to create the Searchlight Archive. The archive is &quot;one of the most extensive and significant resources of its type in Europe.&quot; Open to the public since 2013, it features a wide range of original source material, including oral histories, back editions of magazines, journals, flyers and other materials from groups on the far-right as well as far-left. The collection&#x27;s largest section of material is on far right movements, such as the British National Party.

<text>The Gabo Reform (), also Kabo Reform, describes a series of sweeping reforms suggested to the government of Korea, beginning in 1894 and ending in 1896 during the reign of Gojong of Korea in response to the Donghak Peasant Revolution. Historians debate the degree of Japanese influence in this program, as well as its effect in encouraging modernization.

The term &quot;Gabo&quot; () comes from the name of the year 1894 in the traditional sexagenary cycle.

== Background ==

The disarray and blatant corruption in the Korean government, particularly in the three main areas of revenues – land tax, military service, and the state granary system – weighed heavily on the Korean peasantry.

Of special note is the corruption of the local functionaries (&quot;Hyangi&quot;) who could purchase an appointment as administrators and cloak their predations on the farmers with an aura of officialdom. Yangban families, formerly well-respected for their status as a noble class, were increasingly seen as little more than commoners who were unwilling to meet their responsibilities to their communities. 

Faced with increasing corruption in the government, brigandage of the disenfranchised (such as the mounted fire brigands, or &quot;Hwajok&quot;, and the boat-borne water brigands or &quot;Sujok&quot;) as well as abuse by the military, many poor villagers sought to pool their resources such as land, tools, and production skills in order to survive. 

Despite the government abolishing slavery and burning the records in 1801, increasing numbers of peasants and farmers become involved in &quot;mutual assistance associations&quot;. Institutions such as the Catholic and Protestant missions, with the egalitarian nature of their teachings garnered followings among the Yangban, though commonly in the more urban areas.

Arguably of greater influence were the religious teachings of Choe Je-u, (최제우, 崔濟愚, 1824–1864) called Donghak or &quot;Eastern Learning&quot; which became especially popular in rural areas. Themes of exclusionism (of foreign influences), nationalism, salvation, and social consciousness were promoted to allow illiterate farmers to understand the concepts and accept them more readily. 

Choi, like many Koreans, was alarmed by the intrusion of Christianity and the Anglo-French occupation of Beijing during the Second Opium War. He believed that the best way to counter foreign influence in Korea was to introduce democratic and human rights reforms internally. Nationalism and social reform struck a chord among the peasant guerrillas, and Donghak spread all across Korea. Progressive revolutionaries organized the peasants into a cohesive structure. Arrested in 1863 following the Chinju Uprising led by Yu Kye-cheun, Choi was charged with &quot;misleading the people and sowing discord in society&quot;. Choi was beheaded in 1864, sending many of his followers into hiding in the mountains and leaving the Korean populace to continue to suffer.

King Gojong (r. 1864–1910), enthroned at the age of twelve, succeeded King Cheolchong (r. 1849 – 1863). King Gojong&#x27;s father, Heungseon Daewongun (Yi Ha-Ung; 1820–1898), ruled as the &quot;de facto&quot; regent and inaugurated far-ranging reform to strengthen the central administration. Among his targeted reforms was addressing the inherited rule by a few elite ruling families by the adoption of a merit system for official appointments. 

In addition, &quot;Seowon&quot; (private academies), which threatened to develop a parallel system to the corrupt government and enjoyed special privileges and large land-holdings, were repressed through taxes despite bitter opposition from Confucian scholars. The decision to rebuild palace buildings and finance it through additional levies on the population caused Heungseon Daewongun&#x27;s attempted reforms to antagonize the three largest constituencies supporting the government: the ruling elite, the Confucian scholars, and the general population. Heungseon Daewongun was impeached in 1873 and forced into retirement by the supporters of Empress Myeongseong.

On 27 February 1876, the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1876, also known in Japan as the Japanese-Korean Treaty of Amity (, ) was signed. It was designed to open up Korea to Japanese trade, and the rights granted to Japan under the treaty were similar to those granted to European powers in Japan following the visit of Commodore Matthew Perry in 1854. However, the treaty ended Korea&#x27;s status as a protectorate of China, forced open three Korean ports to Japanese trade, granted extraterritorial rights to Japanese citizens, and was an unequal treaty signed under duress of the Unyo Incident of 1875 (gunboat diplomacy).

Daewongun remained opposed to any concessions to Japan or the Western Europeans, helped organize the mutiny of 1882 Imo Incident, an anti-Japanese outbreak against the Empress and her allies. Motivated by resentment of the preferential treatment given to newly trained troops, Daewongun&#x27;s forces, or &quot;old military&quot;, killed Japanese training cadre and attacked the Japanese legation. Japanese diplomats, policemen, students and some Min clan members were also killed during the incident. 

Daewongun was restored to power briefly, only to be forcibly taken to China by Chinese troops dispatched to Seoul to prevent further disorder. In August 1882, the Treaty of Chemulpo (Japan–Korea Treaty of 1882) indemnified the families of the Japanese victims, paid reparation to the Japanese government in the amount of 500,000 yen and allowed a company of Japanese guards to be stationed at the Japanese legation in Seoul.

The struggle between Heungseon Daewongun&#x27;s followers and those of Empress Myeongseong was further complicated by competition from a Korean independence faction known as the Progressive Party (Kaehwadang) as well as Conservative faction. While the former sought Japan&#x27;s support, the latter sought China&#x27;s support. On 4 December 1884, the Korean independence group, assisted by the Japanese , attempted a coup (Kapsin Chongbyon; Coup d&#x27;État of 1884) and established a pro-Japanese government under the reigning king, dedicated to the independence of Korea from Chinese suzerainty.

However, this proved to be short-lived as conservative Korean officials requested the help of Chinese forces stationed in Korea. The coup was put down by Chinese troops, and a Korean mob killed both Japanese officers and Japanese residents in retaliation. Some leaders of the independence faction, including Kim Okgyun, fled to Japan, while others were executed.

== Donghak revolution, and first Sino-Japanese war, 1894 ==
The outbreak of the Donghak Peasant Revolution in 1894 provided a seminal pretext for direct military intervention by Japan in the affairs of Korea. Seeking redressal of long-standing hardship and corruption, disparate factions among the Korean peasant population coalesced into a militant force and revolted against the Korean administration. In April 1894, the Korean government asked for Chinese assistance in ending the Donghak Peasant Revolt. In response, Japanese leaders, citing a violation of Convention of Tientsin as a pretext, decided upon military intervention to challenge China. China requested Japan to withdraw her troops; Japan refused and proposed that the Qing and Japan co-ordinate to reform the Korean government. The Qing refused. 

On 3 May 1894, 1,500 Qing dynasty forces appeared in Incheon. The same day, 6,000 Japanese forces also landed in Incheon leading to the Sino-Japanese War. Japan deposed the Korean government and installed a new government which demanded the Qing leave, and began a programme of reform. Japan won the First Sino-Japanese War, and China signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895. Among its many stipulations, the treaty recognized &quot;the full and complete independence and autonomy of Korea,&quot; thus ending Korea&#x27;s tributary relationship with the Chinese Qing Dynasty, leading to the proclamation of full independence of Joseon Korea in 1895. 

At the same time, Japan suppressed the Donghak Revolution with Korean government forces. Though the revolt had ended, issues and complaints of the Korean peasant population remained un-addressed.

==Reforms==
The reforms were largely accomplished in three stages, according to the changing members of the reform council and the involvement of Japan. 

===First reforms===
The first reforms took place from July to October 1894, based on the original reform bill presented by the Japanese ambassador, Ōtori Keisuke (). Previously, the reform bill had been refused by the Joseon court and Qing dynasty. As Japan was focused more on the Sino-Japanese War, many of the first reforms reflected the desired reforms of the progressive council members and some of the reforms demanded by the peasants of the Donghak Peasant Revolution did not go unheard. The deliberate Council passed 210 reform bills by Kim Hong-jip. At the first stage of reform, there was little interference from Japan.

Two-hundred and ten articles were established, most notable was the restructuring of central government by reducing the king&#x27;s responsibilities and placing more power in the &quot;Uijeongbu&quot;. The &quot;gwageo&quot; system was abolished and replaced by a Japanese bureaucratic system. The administration of financial affairs were centralized, the taxation system redressed, a new monetary system allowed the use of Japanese currency, and the measurement system was changed to that of Japan. 

Other social reforms were addressed as well; discrimination based on the class system, slavery, underage marriage were banned, and widows were granted the right to remarry. These reforms would legally change the traditional feudal system that had been followed for hundreds of years.

===Second reforms===
The second state of reform took place from December 1894 to July 1895. Japan closed down the &quot;Gunguk Gimucheo&quot; in December 1894 as the outcome of the Sino-Japanese War was leaning to their favor and set up a new coalition cabinet consisting of Kim Hong-jip and Park Yung-hio. The cabinet presented a new law, &quot;Hongbeom 14jo&quot; (홍범 14조, &quot;Exemplary Rules&quot; 14 articles), which proclaimed the severance of the subordinate relationship with China, abolition of nepotism in government, and restructuring of government offices and their duties. 

With this law as the foundation, 213 new articles were created. The names of &quot;Uijeongbu&quot; and its subsidiaries were changed to the modern &quot;naegak&quot; (내각, cabinet) and &quot;bu&quot; (부, department). Administrative districts were reorganized to 23 &quot;bu&quot;(부, region) and 337 &quot;gun&quot;(군, district). New financial bureaus were installed throughout the nation to overlook tax affairs, military, and police systems were overhauled and modernized, judicial systems were changed with new courthouse and judiciary laws.

The second reform measures were halted when Park Yung-hio, who had been at the center of the reform efforts, fled to Japan after being accused of conspiracy to treason by those who were against the reformations that were taking place.

=== Assassination of Queen Min, 1895 ===
The Japanese minister to Korea, Miura Gorō, orchestrated a plot against 43-year-old Queen Min (later given the title Empress Myeongseong), and on 8 October 1895, she was assassinated by Japanese agents. In 2001, Russian reports on the assassination were found in the archives of the Foreign Ministry of the Russian Federation. The documents included the testimony of King Gojong, several witnesses of the assassination, and Karl Ivanovich Weber&#x27;s report to Aleksey Lobanov-Rostovsky, the Foreign Minister of Russia. Weber was the chargé d&#x27;affaires at the Russian legation in Seoul at that time. According to a Russian eyewitness, Seredin-Sabatin (Середин-Cабатин), an employee of the Korean king, a group of Japanese agents entered Gyeongbokgung, killed Queen Min and desecrated her body in the north wing of the palace.

When he heard the news, Heungseon Daewongun returned to the royal palace the same day. On 11 February 1896, King Gojong and the crown prince moved from Gyeongbokgung to the Russian legation in Jeong-dong, Seoul, from where they governed for about one year, an event known as the Korea royal refuge at the Russian legation. After returning to the royal palace, the royal family was still guarded by Russian guards.

In the midst of disarray in Joseon politics at this time, a series of Seonbi scholars mobilized volunteers to fight against the external foreign influence on the government. This also led to the uprising of the Eulmi temporary armies aimed at avenging the assassination of Queen Min.

===Third reforms===
Spurred greatly by the assassination of the queen and subsequent unrest, the government, then led by a new progressive cabinet headed by Kim Hong-jip and Yu Kil-chun, carried out reforms from October 1895 to February 1896. A special reform body, &quot;Gunguk Gimucheo&quot; (, Deliberative Council), was created to establish rules. Their policies resulted in the official discarding of the lunar calendar in favor of the modern Gregorian solar calendar, the official designation of regnal years independent of the Chinese tradition, the creation of a postal service, the introduction of primary schools and a new educational system and the renewal of the military system.

The most controversial reform at this time was the proclamation of the &quot;Short Hair Act&quot; (), i.e. cutting off the traditional Korean male &quot;sangtu&quot; and reformation of traditional attire. It triggered many protests among the people, most notably the conservative scholars, who were already disillusioned by the pro-Japanese cabinet. They had created the Righteous Army and had actively protested nationwide, escalating after the assassination of Queen Myeongseong in 1895. After King Gojong and the Crown Prince fled for refuge to the Russian legation in 1896, this opposition resulted in the murders of Kim Hong-jip and other cabinet members, and the reformations came to an end.

===Main provisions of the Gabo Reform===
The Gabo Reform was similar to the Meiji Restoration in Japan and produced the following sweeping changes and declarations:
# Korea is a sovereign country (i.e., completely independent from China&#x27;s external interference).
# Hierarchical society (class system) is abolished. Social privileges of the Yangban classes are eliminated.
# Those with talent are to be allowed to study and appointed to government posts based on merit alone, regardless of social class.
# The army is to be established on the basis of conscription, regardless of background. A modern police force and military are established.
# All official documents are to be written in Hangul, and not hanja (Chinese characters).
# Leather working, acting, and so on are to no longer be regarded as degrading work, and the people who do them are no longer outcasts. 
# A sound system of fiscal management and to use the government&#x27;s fiscal resources to create wealth for the country is developed.
# Torture of suspects and witnesses was banned, guilt by association ended (punishment of family members of criminals).
# End of merchant monopolies.
# Ban of sale of slaves from 1886 confirmed, and all forms of legal slavery ended.
# Marriage age raised to twenty for men and sixteen for women (outlawing child marriage).

=== Protests for democracy and the proclamation of Korean Empire, 1896–1898 ===

After the Royal Refuge, some Korean activists established the Independence Club (독립협회, 獨立協會) in 1896. They claimed that Korea should negotiate with Western powers, particularly Russia, to counterbalance the growing influence of Japan and Russia. This club had contributed to the construction of Independence Gate, and they held regular meetings at the Jongno streets, demanding democratic reforms as Korea became a constitutional monarchy, and an end to Japanese and Russian influence in Korean affairs. In October 1897, King Gojong decided to return to his other palace, Deoksugung, and proclaimed the founding of the Korean Empire. During this period, the Korean government conducted a westernization policy. It was not an enduring reform, however, and the Independence Club was dissolved on 25 December 1898 as Emperor Gojong officially announced a prohibition on unofficial congresses.

<text> () is the martial art of stick fighting using a bō, which is the Japanese word for staff. Staffs have been in use for thousands of years in Asian martial arts like Silambam. Some techniques involve slashing, swinging, and stabbing with the staff. Others involve using the staff as a vaulting pole or as a prop for hand-to-hand strikes.

Today &quot;bōjutsu&quot; is usually associated either with Okinawan &quot;kobudō&quot;
or with Japanese &quot;koryū budō&quot;. Japanese &quot;bōjutsu&quot; is one of the core elements of classical martial training.

Thrusting, swinging, and striking techniques often resemble empty-hand movements, following the philosophy that the &quot;bō&quot; is merely an &quot;extension of one’s limbs&quot;. Consequently, bōjutsu is often incorporated into other styles of empty-hand fighting, like traditional Jū-jutsu, and karate.

In the Okinawan context, the weapon is frequently referred to as the &quot;kon&quot; (棍).

<doc id="327626" wikidata="Q623973" url="?curid=327626" title="Choe Sejin">
<text>Choe Sejin (; ; 1465 – February 10, 1542) was a Korean linguist, and a translator and interpreter of the Chinese language during the Joseon Dynasty. He is of the Goesan Choe clan and his courtesy name was Gongseo (). He is widely known for his research with the Korean hangul letters, and comparative studies with Chinese and Korean, which further led to the propagation of hangul during a time period when Chinese characters were used as the main system of writing. Choe was recognized by many for his talents as an official interpreter in the Korean Embassies in Beijing and in his works in hangul research. However, he lived a tumultuous life due to this middle class status, which led him to be the target of many envious aristocrats of his era.

Choe devised the modern Korean order of the hangul characters, and assigned names to the letters. His most famous book on hangul is the &quot;Hunmong Jahoe&quot; (; &quot;Collection of Characters for Training the Unenlightened&quot;, 1527). Over the course of 40 years, he composed 7 original works, and published 10 translations and research works.

== Biography ==
Choe Sejin was born into a middle-class family in Seoul. His father was Choe Jungbal, who was also a translator and interpreter for the government. Choe Sejin&#x27;s birth year is not found in any records, but given the record found in &quot;&quot;, his birth year is estimated as 1465. However, there are other claims that he was born in 1473. When he was 21, he passed the &quot;Translating and Interpreting Government Exam&quot; and when he was 38, he placed second in another exam, the &quot;Bong Se Ja Byul Shi&quot; Exam, an exam conducted to celebrate the crowning of the Prince.

Choe was known as very skilled as a translator and interpreter. However, during a time period when society was strictly stratified, his middle class status restricted his career and even led him to many difficulties and hardships. The noble class organized society in a way that they controlled and possessed a majority of the wealth and property of the country, and it was common for the nobility to be jealous over highly talented middle class government officials who might successfully become promoted, and surpass nobles in rank, although this was very rare. Choe Sejin was a target for the nobles&#x27; jealousy, and he was sacrificed in the factional strife and tumultuous political climate at the time. For example, two months after he passed the &quot;Bong Se Ja Byul Shi&quot; Exam, his acceptance became nullified because of an involvement in a trial for the murder of the deposed Queen, Yoon. Even though he was not directly involved, the Minister of Culture and Education, Lee Sejwa, who conducted the exam and personally recommended Choe was involved in the trial, and as a result, all acceptances were nullified. Some were able to retain their acceptance due to familial ties, however, Choe was not one of them. Even after 3 years of waiting, he was accused of writing the anonymous letter criticizing the National Court in 1507 and was subject to a severe sentence. He was saved from this accusation after more investigation, but this highlights the kind of difficulties he faced due to his social class.

Two months after the accusations proved false, he encountered a golden opportunity that allowed him to receive his government rank back. An envoy from China was visiting the King of Joseon, but there was no one appropriate and qualified to serve as the interpreter during the visit. Choe Sejin was chosen as the interpreter reluctantly, but he successfully completed the task and was recognized for his talents. The King recognized his works, and he was able to further his career.

Upon his death, a scholar named dedicated a poem to Choe. The poem is called &quot;Choi Dong Ji Se Jin Man&quot; (崔同知世珍挽) and is widely known because of the information it holds about Choe Sejin. Because there are few records left about Choe, this poem provides one of the best sources of details about Choe&#x27;s life through the eyes of his friend, Kim.

== &quot;Hunmong Jahoe&quot; and his works with hangul ==

Choe Sejin is mostly known for his 1527 work, &quot;Hunmong Jahoe&quot; (). It is a textbook for children to learn the Chinese characters, and is known to be very practical in its teachings. During the Joseon Era, literacy in Chinese was an essential skill for advancement in society. Chinese was the dominant language of literature at this time, and children were taught Chinese from an early age to prepare for the future. Although hangul, the Korean orthography, existed by this time, it was not widely used in the country. Choe wanted to promote the usage of hangul through his work &quot;Hunmong Jahoe&quot;. As a textbook for children to learn Chinese, &quot;Hunmong Jahoe&quot; incorporated hangul in the textbook to promote both the learning of Chinese characters, as well as hangul. The Chinese characters were annotated in hangul, and in order for one to understand and learn the Chinese characters, one must have a full grasp of hangul first to comprehend the annotations. Choe wanted people to use hangul more extensively, and he thought that this would encourage people to take some time to fully learn hangul, before starting to learn Chinese. He wrote that &quot;it would take [only a single day] to learn Hangul&quot;, commenting on the simplicity of hangul, and afterwards, one would be able to learn Chinese on their own without an instructor if one knew hangul and utilized his textbook.

This book was known at the time for being revolutionary for its practicality and creativity. The two widely used works for learning Chinese characters during his time were called &quot;Thousand Character Classic&quot; and &quot;Yoo Hap&quot;. The &quot;Thousand Character Classic&quot; was considered very tedious and contained words that were conceptual and not suitable for daily use, while the other text &quot;Yoo Hap&quot; was thought to be not suitable for daily instruction. &quot;Hunmong Jahoe&quot; attempted to supplement these weaknesses, while combining their strengths in the breadth of content. The &quot;Thousand Character Classic&quot; contained 1,000 characters, while &quot;Hunmong Jahoe&quot; contained 3,360 characters. It also ordered the Chinese characters with relation to its meanings: Chinese characters with similar meanings were grouped together to ease the process of learning.

As one of the phoneticians in the history of the Joseon Dynasty, he compiled the order of the Korean letters in &quot;Hunmong Jahoe&quot;. The first eight characters in the order that is presented in this work are characterized as sounds that are &quot;used for both the initial and the final sounds&quot;. The next eight set of characters are described as &quot;those used only for the initial sounds&quot;. These eight characters that occur initially are ordered as the following: &quot;Molar [kh], the Tongue [th], the Lip [ph], the Tooth [c ch], the Half Tooth [z], and the Throat [0]&quot;. Only the order of these eight characters have been retained until the present and the order of the other characters as proposed by Choe have been altered. The reason for the change of the order of the other characters are unidentifiable. Choe also ordered the vowels in Hangul. He ordered them according to sequence in which we open our mouth to articulate these vowels. His ordering of the vowels is the order that is currently used in present-day Korea.

&quot;Hunmong Jahoe&quot; has been republished 10 times over the time period of 400 years. It was the most reproduced Chinese textbook of the Joseon Era, and it was also widely used in Japan.

== Career and legacy ==
Despite Choe&#x27;s social class and the difficulties he faced during his lifetime, the records we have of him indicate his significance and influence on Korean hangul, the education of Chinese characters, and the field of linguistics. Scholars that belong to the middle class rarely get recognized for their works, and no historical records are ever kept of middle-class citizens. The available records of Choe are very scarce, however, the sole presence of even a minuscule historical record indicates that he was an influential figure in the history of the Korean language.

When his reputation was restored after he served as a translator to the king during a visit by the Chinese envoy, Choe successfully built his career as a translator, interpreter and linguist. His linguistic talent is even recorded in the , which is a chronological record of King Jungjong&#x27;s historical reigns from 1506 to 1544. Yoo Soon, a prime minister of the Joseon Dynasty, wrote that Choe was &quot;the best in the nation when it comes to Chinese writing and pronunciation&quot; and that he was worried that there was no one to succeed him to translate and respond to documents sent from China. Thus, Yoo Soon wrote a petition to the King, asking him to pick approximately six talented individuals to be instructed by Choe Sejin, in order to make sure that Choe&#x27;s legacy was maintained. The King also wrote about his worries that Choe might be the only person capable of handling proper relations with China.

In addition to his skills as a translator and interpreter, his works also contain his legacy. He published a lot in the field of linguistics, especially in the realm of Chinese linguistics directed towards a Korean audience. He translated numerous works such as &quot;Bak Tongsa&quot;, &quot;Interpreter Park&quot;, which was a Chinese textbook, and elaborated on its research through his own work &quot;Sasung Tonghae&quot;, &quot;Explaining the Four Sounds&quot;.

== Commentary on Choe Sejin and his works ==
There are very scarce resources available to shed light onto Choe Sejin&#x27;s life. One work that reveals a lot about Choe&#x27;s character and his influence during his time is a poem written as a eulogy by one of his friends, Kim Ankook. The poem was written in 1542 after Choe&#x27;s death, and is titled &quot;Choe Dong Ji Se Jin Man&quot; ().

This is a poem that reflects Kim Ankook&#x27;s sorrow upon his friend Choe&#x27;s death. This is a poem that is one of the most known among Korean linguistics, because there is a lot of information about Choe packed into a single poem. According to Kim, it can be known that Choe went through a lot of hardships during the 40 years he served as a government official, and eventually lived a long life, &quot;having seen the death of many of his loved ones&quot;. Another line of the poem, &quot;who will I discuss and debate with when composing diplomat documents?&quot;, indicates that he was an important figure in international diplomacy, especially with respect to translation and interpretation. Lastly, Kim notes that his accomplishments will last far into the future, since his works are considered as &quot;a great service to the future&quot;. This highlights Choe&#x27;s influence in the field of Korean linguistics.

== Other notable works ==
In addition to &quot;Hunmong Jahoe&quot;, Choe also composed 17 research publications over the course of 40 years in total. A few of his most notable works are:

* &quot;Sasung Tonghae&quot; (; 1517) marks the intonations, and the correct pronunciations of Chinese characters in hangul. It also includes records of 450 Korean words in hangul, and is an important source for the research on the history of the Korean language.
* &quot;Sohak Pyunmong&quot; (; 1537) is a textbook for Chinese language learners, dedicated to the King.
* &quot;Unhoe Okpyun&quot; (; 1537) is a supplementary material published to add on to the works in &quot;Sasung Tonghae&quot;.
* &quot;Yeohyo Kyung&quot; (; 1541) was one of his last works, written when he was 76.
* &quot;Kyungsung Ji&quot; (; 1541), a work about the Nanjing city in China, was one of his last works before he died at the age of 77.

<text>The Greco-Persian Wars (also often called the Persian Wars) were a series of conflicts between the Achaemenid Empire and Greek city-states that started in 499 BC and lasted until 449 BC. The collision between the fractious political world of the Greeks and the enormous empire of the Persians began when Cyrus the Great conquered the Greek-inhabited region of Ionia in 547 BC. Struggling to control the independent-minded cities of Ionia, the Persians appointed tyrants to rule each of them. This would prove to be the source of much trouble for the Greeks and Persians alike.

In 499 BC, the tyrant of Miletus, Aristagoras, embarked on an expedition to conquer the island of Naxos, with Persian support; however, the expedition was a debacle and, preempting his dismissal, Aristagoras incited all of Hellenic Asia Minor into rebellion against the Persians. This was the beginning of the Ionian Revolt, which would last until 493 BC, progressively drawing more regions of Asia Minor into the conflict. Aristagoras secured military support from Athens and Eretria, and in 498 BC these forces helped to capture and burn the Persian regional capital of Sardis. The Persian king Darius the Great vowed to have revenge on Athens and Eretria for this act. The revolt continued, with the two sides effectively stalemated throughout 497–495 BC. In 494 BC, the Persians regrouped and attacked the epicenter of the revolt in Miletus. At the Battle of Lade, the Ionians suffered a decisive defeat, and the rebellion collapsed, with the final embers being stamped out the following year.

Seeking to secure his empire from further revolts and from the interference of the mainland Greeks, Darius embarked on a scheme to conquer Greece and to punish Athens and Eretria for the burning of Sardis. The first Persian invasion of Greece began in 492 BC, with the Persian general Mardonius successfully re-subjugating Thrace and Macedon before several mishaps forced an early end to the rest of the campaign. In 490 BC a second force was sent to Greece, this time across the Aegean Sea, under the command of Datis and Artaphernes. This expedition subjugated the Cyclades, before besieging, capturing and razing Eretria. However, while en route to attack Athens, the Persian force was decisively defeated by the Athenians at the Battle of Marathon, ending Persian efforts for the time being.

Darius then began to plan to completely conquer Greece but died in 486 BC and responsibility for the conquest passed to his son Xerxes. In 480 BC, Xerxes personally led the second Persian invasion of Greece with one of the largest ancient armies ever assembled. Victory over the allied Greek states at the famous Battle of Thermopylae allowed the Persians to torch an evacuated Athens and overrun most of Greece. However, while seeking to destroy the combined Greek fleet, the Persians suffered a severe defeat at the Battle of Salamis. The following year, the confederated Greeks went on the offensive, decisively defeating the Persian army at the Battle of Plataea, and ending the invasion of Greece by the Achaemenid Empire.

The allied Greeks followed up their success by destroying the rest of the Persian fleet at the Battle of Mycale, before expelling Persian garrisons from Sestos (479 BC) and Byzantium (478 BC). Following the Persian withdrawal from Europe and the Greek victory at Mycale, Macedon and the city-states of Ionia regained their independence. The actions of the general Pausanias at the siege of Byzantium alienated many of the Greek states from the Spartans, and the anti-Persian alliance was therefore reconstituted around Athenian leadership, called the Delian League. The Delian League continued to campaign against Persia for the next three decades, beginning with the expulsion of the remaining Persian garrisons from Europe. At the Battle of the Eurymedon in 466 BC, the League won a double victory that finally secured freedom for the cities of Ionia. However, the League&#x27;s involvement in the Egyptian revolt by Inaros II against Artaxerxes I (from 460–454 BC) resulted in a disastrous Greek defeat, and further campaigning was suspended. A Greek fleet was sent to Cyprus in 451 BC, but achieved little, and, when it withdrew, the Greco-Persian Wars drew to a quiet end. Some historical sources suggest the end of hostilities was marked by a peace treaty between Athens and Persia, the Peace of Callias.

==Sources==

All the surviving primary sources for the Greco-Persian Wars are Greek; no contemporary accounts survive in other languages. By far the most important source is the fifth-century Greek historian Herodotus. Herodotus, who has been called the &quot;Father of History&quot;, was born in 484 BC in Halicarnassus, Asia Minor (then part of the Persian empire). He wrote his &#x27;Enquiries&#x27; (Greek &quot;Historia&quot;, English &quot;(The) Histories&quot;) around 440–430 BC, trying to trace the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars, which would still have been recent history. Herodotus&#x27;s approach was novel and, at least in Western society, he invented &#x27;history&#x27; as a discipline. As historian Tom Holland has it, &quot;For the first time, a chronicler set himself to trace the origins of a conflict not to a past so remote so as to be utterly fabulous, nor to the whims and wishes of some god, nor to a people&#x27;s claim to manifest destiny, but rather explanations he could verify personally.&quot;

Some later ancient historians, starting with Thucydides, criticized Herodotus and his methods. Nevertheless, Thucydides chose to begin his history where Herodotus left off (at the siege of Sestos) and felt Herodotus&#x27;s history was accurate enough not to need re-writing or correcting. Plutarch criticised Herodotus in his essay &quot;On The Malignity of Herodotus&quot;, describing Herodotus as &quot;Philobarbaros&quot; (barbarian-lover) for not being pro-Greek enough, which suggests that Herodotus might actually have done a reasonable job of being even-handed. A negative view of Herodotus was passed on to Renaissance Europe, though he remained widely read. However, since the 19th century, his reputation has been dramatically rehabilitated by archaeological finds that have repeatedly confirmed his version of events. The prevailing modern view is that Herodotus did a remarkable job in his &quot;Historia&quot;, but that some of his specific details (particularly troop numbers and dates) should be viewed with skepticism. Nevertheless, there are still some historians who believe Herodotus made up much of his story.
The military history of Greece between the end of the second Persian invasion of Greece and the Peloponnesian War (479–431 BC) is not well supported by surviving ancient sources. This period, sometimes referred to as the &quot;pentekontaetia&quot; (&quot;πεντηκονταετία&quot;, &quot;the Fifty Years&quot;) by ancient writers, was a period of relative peace and prosperity within Greece. The richest source for the period, and also the most contemporaneous, is Thucydides&#x27; &quot;History of the Peloponnesian War&quot;, which is generally considered by modern historians to be a reliable primary account. Thucydides only mentions this period in a digression on the growth of Athenian power in the run up to the Peloponnesian War, and the account is brief, probably selective and lacks any dates. Nevertheless, Thucydides&#x27;s account can be, and is, used by historians to draw up a skeleton chronology for the period, on to which details from archaeological records and other writers can be superimposed.

More detail for the whole period is provided by Plutarch, in his biographies of Themistocles, Aristides and especially Cimon. Plutarch was writing some 600 years after the events in question, and is therefore a secondary source, but he often names his sources, which allows some degree of verification of his statements. In his biographies, he draws directly from many ancient histories that have not survived, and thus often preserves details of the period that are omitted in Herodotus and Thucydides&#x27;s accounts. The final major existing source for the period is the universal history (&quot;Bibliotheca historica&quot;) of the 1st century BC Sicilian, Diodorus Siculus. Much of Diodorus&#x27;s writing about this period is drawn from the much earlier Greek historian Ephorus, who also wrote a universal history. Diodorus is also a secondary source and often derided by modern historians for his style and inaccuracies, but he preserves many details of the ancient period found nowhere else.

Further scattered details can be found in Pausanias&#x27;s &quot;Description of Greece&quot;, while the Byzantine Suda dictionary of the 10th century AD preserves some anecdotes found nowhere else. Minor sources for the period include the works of Pompeius Trogus (epitomized by Justinus), Cornelius Nepos and Ctesias of Cnidus (epitomized by Photius), which are not in their original textual form. These works are not considered reliable (especially Ctesias), and are not particularly useful for reconstructing the history of this period.

A few physical remnants of the conflict have been found by archaeologists. The most famous is the Serpent Column in Istanbul, which was originally placed at Delphi to commemorate the Greek victory at Plataea. In 1939, Greek archaeologist Spyridon Marinatos found the remains of numerous Persian arrowheads at the Kolonos Hill on the field of Thermopylae, which is now generally identified as the site of the defender&#x27;s last stand.

==Origins of the conflict==
The Greeks of the classical period believed that, in the dark age that followed the collapse of the Mycenaean civilization, significant numbers of Greeks fled and had emigrated to Asia Minor and settled there. Modern historians generally accept this migration as historic (but separate from the later colonization of the Mediterranean by the Greeks). There are, however, those who believe the Ionian migration cannot be explained as simply as the classical Greeks claimed. These settlers were from three tribal groups: the Aeolians, Dorians and Ionians. The Ionians had settled about the coasts of Lydia and Caria, founding the twelve cities that made up Ionia. These cities were Miletus, Myus and Priene in Caria; Ephesus, Colophon, Lebedos, Teos, Clazomenae, Phocaea and Erythrae in Lydia; and the islands of Samos and Chios. Although the Ionian cities were independent of one another, they recognized their shared heritage and supposedly had a common temple and meeting place, the &quot;Panionion&quot;. They thus formed a &#x27;cultural league&#x27;, to which they would admit no other cities, or even other tribal Ionians.

The cities of Ionia remained independent until they were conquered by the Lydians of western Asia Minor. The Lydian king Alyattes attacked Miletus, a conflict that ended with a treaty of alliance between Miletus and Lydia, that meant that Miletus would have internal autonomy but follow Lydia in foreign affairs. At this time, the Lydians were also in conflict with the Median Empire, and the Milesians sent an army to aid the Lydians in this conflict. Eventually a peaceable settlement was established between the Medes and the Lydians, with the Halys River set up as the border between the kingdoms. The famous Lydian king Croesus succeeded his father Alyattes in around 560 BC and set about conquering the other Greek city states of Asia Minor.

The Persian prince Cyrus led a rebellion against the last Median king Astyages in 553 BC. Cyrus was a grandson of Astyages and was supported by part of the Median aristocracy. By 550 BC, the rebellion was over, and Cyrus had emerged victorious, founding the Achaemenid Empire in place of the Median kingdom in the process. Croesus saw the disruption in the Median Empire and Persia as an opportunity to extend his realm and asked the oracle of Delphi whether he should attack them. The Oracle supposedly replied the famously ambiguous answer that &quot;if Croesus was to cross the Halys he would destroy a great empire&quot;. Blind to the ambiguity of this prophecy, Croesus attacked the Persians, but was eventually defeated and Lydia fell to Cyrus.

While fighting the Lydians, Cyrus had sent messages to the Ionians asking them to revolt against Lydian rule, which the Ionians had refused to do. After Cyrus finished the conquest of Lydia, the Ionian cities now offered to be his subjects under the same terms as they had been subjects of Croesus. Cyrus refused, citing the Ionians&#x27; unwillingness to help him previously. The Ionians thus prepared to defend themselves, and Cyrus sent the Median general Harpagus to conquer them. He first attacked Phocaea; the Phocaeans decided to abandon their city entirely and sail into exile in Sicily, rather than become Persian subjects (although many later returned). Some Teians also chose to emigrate when Harpagus attacked Teos, but the rest of the Ionians remained, and were each in turn conquered.

In the years following their conquest, the Persians found the Ionians difficult to rule. Elsewhere in the empire, Cyrus identified elite native groups such as the priesthood of Judea – to help him rule his new subjects. No such group existed in Greek cities at this time; while there was usually an aristocracy, this was inevitably divided into feuding factions. The Persians thus settled for sponsoring a tyrant in each Ionian city, even though this drew them into the Ionians&#x27; internal conflicts. Furthermore, certain tyrants might develop an independent streak and have to be replaced. The tyrants themselves faced a difficult task; they had to deflect the worst of their fellow citizens&#x27; hatred, while staying in the favour of the Persians. In the past, Greek states had often been ruled by tyrants, but that form of government was on the decline. Past tyrants had also tended and needed to be strong and able leaders, whereas the rulers appointed by the Persians were simply place-men. Backed by Persian military might, these tyrants did not need the support of the population, and could thus rule absolutely. On the eve of the Greco-Persian wars, it is probable that the Ionian population had become discontented and was ready for rebellion.

===Warfare in the ancient Mediterranean===
In the Greco-Persian wars both sides made use of spear-armed infantry and light missile troops. Greek armies placed the emphasis on heavier infantry, while Persian armies favoured lighter troop types.

====Persia====
The Persian military consisted of a diverse group of men drawn across the various nations of the empire. However, according to Herodotus, there was at least a general conformity in armor and style of fighting. The troops were usually armed with a bow, a &#x27;short spear&#x27; and a sword or axe, and carried a wicker shield. They wore a leather jerkin, although individuals of high status wore high-quality metal armor. The Persians most likely used their bows to wear down the enemy, then closed in to deliver the final blow with spears and swords. The first rank of Persian infantry formations, the so-called &#x27;sparabara&#x27;, had no bows, carried larger wicker shields and were sometimes armed with longer spears. Their role was to protect the back ranks of the formation. The cavalry probably fought as lightly armed missile cavalry.

====Greece====
The style of warfare between the Greek city-states, which dates back until at least 650 BC (as dated by the &#x27;Chigi vase&#x27;), was based around the hoplite phalanx supported by missile troops. The &#x27;hoplites&#x27; were foot soldiers usually drawn from the members of the middle-classes (in Athens called the &quot;zeugites&quot;), who could afford the equipment necessary to fight in this manner. The heavy armour (the &quot;hoplon&quot;) usually included a breastplate or a linothorax, greaves, a helmet, and a large round, concave shield (the &quot;aspis&quot;) . Hoplites were armed with long spears (the &quot;dory&quot;), which were significantly longer than Persian spears, and a sword (the &quot;xiphos&quot;). The heavy armour and longer spears made them superior in hand-to-hand combat and gave them significant protection against ranged attacks. Lightly armed skirmishers, the psiloi also comprised a part of Greek armies growing in importance during the conflict; at the Battle of Plataea, for instance, they may have formed over half the Greek army. Use of cavalry in Greek armies is not reported in the battles of the Greco-Persian Wars.

====Naval warfare====
At the beginning of the conflict, all naval forces in the eastern Mediterranean had switched to the trireme, a warship powered by three banks of oars. The most common naval tactics during the period were ramming (Greek triremes were equipped with a cast-bronze ram at the bows), or boarding by ship-borne marines. More experienced naval powers had by this time also begun to use a manoeuver known as &quot;diekplous&quot;. It is not clear what this was, but it probably involved sailing into gaps between enemy ships and then ramming them in the side.

The Persian naval forces were primarily provided by the seafaring people of the empire: Phoenicians, Egyptians, Cilicians and Cypriots. Other coastal regions of the Persian Empire would contribute ships throughout the course of the wars.

==Preliminary contacts between Persia and mainland Greece (507 BC)==
In 507 BC, Artaphernes, as brother of Darius I and Satrap of Asia Minor in his capital Sardis, received an embassy from newly democratic Athens, probably sent by Cleisthenes, which was looking for Persian assistance to resist the threats from Sparta. Herodotus reports that Artaphernes had no previous knowledge of the Athenians, and his initial reaction was &quot;Who are these people?&quot;. Artaphernes asked the Athenians for &quot;Water and Earth&quot;, a symbol of submission, if they wanted help from the Achaemenid king. The Athenians ambassadors apparently accepted to comply, and to give &quot;Earth and Water&quot;. Artaphernes also advised the Athenians that they should receive back the Athenian tyrant Hippias. The Persians threatened to attack Athens if they did not accept Hippias. Nevertheless, the Athenians preferred to remain democratic despite the danger from Persia, and the ambassadors were disavowed and censured upon their return to Athens.

There is a possibility that the Achaemenid ruler now saw the Athenians as subjects who had solemnly promised submission through the gift of &quot;Earth and Water&quot;, and that subsequent actions by the Athenians, such as their intervention in the Ionian revolt, were perceived as a break of oath, and a rebellion to the central authority of the Achaemenid ruler.

==Ionian Revolt (499–493 BC)==

The Ionian Revolt and associated revolts in Aeolis, Doris, Cyprus, and Caria were military rebellions by several regions of Asia Minor against Persian rule, lasting from 499 to 493 BC. At the heart of the rebellion was the dissatisfaction of the Greek cities of Asia Minor with the tyrants appointed by Persia to rule them, along with opposition to the individual actions of two Milesian tyrants, Histiaeus and Aristagoras. In 499 BC the then tyrant of Miletus, Aristagoras, launched a joint expedition with the Persian satrap Artaphernes to conquer Naxos, in an attempt to bolster his position in Miletus (both financially and in terms of prestige). The mission was a debacle, and sensing his imminent removal as tyrant, Aristagoras chose to incite the whole of Ionia into rebellion against the Persian king Darius the Great.
Struggling to rule the independent-minded cities of Ionia, the Persians appointed local tyrants to rule each of them. This would prove to be the source of much trouble for the Greeks and Persians alike. In 498 BC, supported by troops from Athens and Eretria, the Ionians marched on, captured, and burnt Sardis. However, on their return journey to Ionia, they were followed by Persian troops, and decisively beaten at the Battle of Ephesus. This campaign was the only offensive action taken by the Ionians, who subsequently went on the defensive. The Persians responded in 497 BC with a three-pronged attack aimed at recapturing the outlying areas of the rebellious territory, but the spread of the revolt to Caria meant the largest army, under Darius, moved there instead. While at first campaigning successfully in Caria, this army was wiped out in an ambush at the Battle of Pedasus. This resulted in a stalemate for the rest of 496 and 495 BC.

By 494 BC the Persian army and navy had regrouped, and they made straight for the epicentre of the rebellion at Miletus. The Ionian fleet sought to defend Miletus by sea, but was defeated decisively at the Battle of Lade, after the Samians had defected. Miletus was then besieged, captured, and its population was enslaved. This double defeat effectively ended the revolt, and the Carians surrendered to the Persians as a result. The Persians spent 493 BC reducing the cities along the west coast that still held out against them, before finally imposing a peace settlement on Ionia that was considered to be both just and fair.

The Ionian Revolt constituted the first major conflict between Greece and the Achaemenid Empire and represents the first phase of the Greco-Persian Wars. Asia Minor had been brought back into the Persian fold, but Darius had vowed to punish Athens and Eretria for their support for the revolt. Moreover, seeing that the political situation in Greece posed a continued threat to the stability of his Empire, he decided to embark on the conquest of all Greece.

==First invasion of Greece (492–490 BC)==

After having reconquered Ionia, the Persians began to plan their next moves of extinguishing the threat to their empire from Greece; and punishing Athens and Eretria. The resultant first Persian invasion of Greece consisted of two main campaigns.

===492 BC: Mardonius&#x27; campaign===
The first campaign, in 492 BC, was led by Darius&#x27;s son-in-law Mardonius, who re-subjugated Thrace, which had nominally been part of the Persian empire since 513 BC. Mardonius was also able to force Macedon to become a fully subordinate client kingdom of Persia; it had previously been a vassal, but retained a broad degree of autonomy. However, further progress in this campaign was prevented when Mardonius&#x27;s fleet was wrecked in a storm off the coast of Mount Athos. Mardonius himself was then injured in a raid on his camp by a Thracian tribe, and after this he returned with the rest of the expedition to Asia.

The following year, having given clear warning of his plans, Darius sent ambassadors to all the cities of Greece, demanding their submission. He received it from almost all of them, except Athens and Sparta, both of whom instead executed the ambassadors. With Athens still defiant, and Sparta now also effectively at war with him, Darius ordered a further military campaign for the following year.

===490 BC: Datis and Artaphernes&#x27; campaign===
In 490 BC, Datis and Artaphernes (son of the satrap Artaphernes) were given command of an amphibious invasion force, and set sail from Cilicia. The Persian force sailed first to the island of Rhodes, where a Lindian Temple Chronicle records that Datis besieged the city of Lindos, but was unsuccessful. The fleet sailed next to Naxos, to punish the Naxians for their resistance to the failed expedition the Persians had mounted there a decade earlier. Many of the inhabitants fled to the mountains; those that the Persians caught were enslaved. The Persians then burnt the city and temples of the Naxians. The fleet then proceeded to island-hop across the rest of the Aegean on its way to Eretria, taking hostages and troops from each island.

The task force sailed on to Euboea, and to the first major target, Eretria. The Eretrians made no attempt to stop the Persians from landing or advancing and thus allowed themselves to be besieged. For six days, the Persians attacked the walls, with losses on both sides; however, on the seventh day two reputable Eretrians opened the gates and betrayed the city to the Persians. The city was razed, and temples and shrines were looted and burned. Furthermore, according to Darius&#x27;s commands, the Persians enslaved all the remaining townspeople.

====Battle of Marathon====


The Persian fleet next headed south down the coast of Attica, landing at the bay of Marathon, roughly from Athens. Under the guidance of Miltiades, the general with the greatest experience of fighting the Persians, the Athenian army marched to block the two exits from the plain of Marathon. Stalemate ensued for five days, before the Persians decided to continue onward to Athens, and began to load their troops back onto the ships. After the Persians had loaded their cavalry (their strongest soldiers) on the ships, the 10,000 Athenian soldiers descended from the hills around the plain. The Greeks crushed the weaker Persian foot soldiers by routing the wings before turning towards the centre of the Persian line. The remnants of the Persian army fled to their ships and left the battle. Herodotus records that 6,400 Persian bodies were counted on the battlefield; the Athenians lost only 192 men.

As soon as the Persian survivors had put to sea, the Athenians marched as quickly as possible to Athens. They arrived in time to prevent Artaphernes from securing a landing in Athens. Seeing his opportunity lost, Artaphernes ended the year&#x27;s campaign and returned to Asia.

The Battle of Marathon was a watershed in the Greco-Persian wars, showing the Greeks that the Persians could be beaten. It also highlighted the superiority of the more heavily armoured Greek hoplites, and showed their potential when used wisely.

==Interbellum (490–480 BC)==
===Achaemenid Empire===

After the failure of the first invasion, Darius began raising a huge new army with which he intended to subjugate Greece completely. However, in 486 BC, his Egyptian subjects revolted, and the revolt forced an indefinite postponement of any Greek expedition. Darius died while preparing to march on Egypt, and the throne of Persia passed to his son Xerxes I. Xerxes crushed the Egyptian revolt, and very quickly resumed the preparations for the invasion of Greece. Since this was to be a full-scale invasion, it needed longterm planning, stockpiling and conscription. Xerxes decided that the Hellespont would be bridged to allow his army to cross to Europe, and that a canal should be dug across the isthmus of Mount Athos (a Persian fleet had been destroyed in 492 BC while rounding this coastline). These were both feats of exceptional ambition that would have been beyond the capabilities of any other contemporary state However, the campaign was delayed by one year because of another revolt in Egypt and Babylonia.

The Persians had the sympathy of several Greek city-states, including Argos, which had pledged to defect when the Persians reached their borders. The Aleuadae family, who ruled Larissa in Thessaly, saw the invasion as an opportunity to extend their power. Thebes, though not explicitly &#x27;Medising&#x27;, was suspected of being willing to aid the Persians once the invasion force arrived.

In 481 BC, after roughly four years of preparation, Xerxes began to muster the troops to invade Europe. Herodotus gives the names of 46 nations from which troops were drafted. The Persian army was gathered in Asia Minor in the summer and autumn of 481 BC. The armies from the Eastern satrapies were gathered in Kritala, Cappadocia and were led by Xerxes to Sardis where they passed the winter. Early in spring, it moved to Abydos where it was joined with the armies of the western satrapies. Then the army that Xerxes had mustered marched towards Europe, crossing the Hellespont on two pontoon bridges.

====Size of the Persian forces====
The numbers of troops that Xerxes mustered for the second invasion of Greece have been the subject of endless dispute. Most modern scholars reject as unrealistic the figures of 2.5 million given by Herodotus and other ancient sources because the victors likely miscalculated or exaggerated. The topic has been hotly debated, but the consensus revolves around the figure of 200,000.

The size of the Persian fleet is also disputed, although perhaps less so. Other ancient authors agree with Herodotus&#x27; number of 1,207. These numbers are by ancient standards consistent, and this could be interpreted that a number around 1,200 is correct. Among modern scholars, some have accepted this number, although suggesting the number must have been lower by the Battle of Salamis. Other recent works on the Persian Wars reject this number, viewing 1,207 as more of a reference to the combined Greek fleet in the Iliad. These works generally claim that the Persians could have launched no more than around 600 warships into the Aegean.

===Greek city states===
====Athens====

A year after Marathon, Miltiades, the hero of Marathon, was injured in a military campaign to Paros. Taking advantage of his incapacitation, the powerful Alcmaeonid family arranged for him to be prosecuted for the failure of the campaign. A huge fine was imposed on Miltiades for the crime of &#x27;deceiving the Athenian people&#x27;, but he died weeks later from his wound.

The politician Themistocles, with a power base firmly established among the poor, filled the vacuum left by Miltiades&#x27;s death, and in the following decade became the most influential politician in Athens. During this period, Themistocles continued to support the expansion of Athens&#x27; naval power. The Athenians were aware throughout this period that the Persian interest in Greece had not ended, and Themistocles&#x27;s naval policies may be seen in the light of the potential threat from Persia. Aristides, Themistocles&#x27;s great rival, and champion of the &quot;zeugites&quot; (the &#x27;upper hoplite-class&#x27;) vigorously opposed such a policy.

In 483 BC, a vast new seam of silver was found in the Athenian mines at Laurium. Themistocles proposed that the silver should be used to build a new fleet of triremes, ostensibly to assist in a long running war with Aegina. Plutarch suggests that Themistocles deliberately avoided mentioning Persia, believing that it was too distant a threat for the Athenians to act on, but that countering Persia was the fleet&#x27;s aim. Fine suggests that many Athenians must have admitted that such a fleet would be needed to resist the Persians, whose preparations for the coming campaign were known. Themistocles&#x27;s motion was passed easily, despite strong opposition from Aristides. Its passage was probably due to the desire of many of the poorer Athenians for paid employment as rowers in the fleet. It is unclear from the ancient sources whether 100 or 200 ships were initially authorised; both Fine and Holland suggest that at first 100 ships were authorised and that a second vote increased this number to the levels seen during the second invasion. Aristides continued to oppose Themistocles&#x27;s policy, and tension between the two camps built over the winter, so the ostracism of 482 BC became a direct contest between Themistocles and Aristides. In what Holland characterises as, in essence, the world&#x27;s first referendum, Aristides was ostracised, and Themistocles&#x27;s policies were endorsed. Indeed, becoming aware of the Persian preparations for the coming invasion, the Athenians voted to build more ships than those for which Themistocles had asked. Thus, during the preparations for the Persian invasion, Themistocles had become the leading politician in Athens.

====Sparta====

The Spartan king Demaratus had been stripped of his kingship in 491 BC, and replaced with his cousin Leotychides. Sometime after 490 BC, the humiliated Demaratus had chosen to go into exile, and had made his way to Darius&#x27;s court in Susa. Demaratus would from then on act as an advisor to Darius, and later Xerxes, on Greek affairs, and accompanied Xerxes during the second Persian invasion. At the end of Herodotus&#x27;s book 7, there is an anecdote relating that prior to the second invasion, Demaratus sent an apparently blank wax tablet to Sparta. When the wax was removed, a message was found scratched on the wooden backing, warning the Spartans of Xerxes&#x27;s plans. However, many historians believe that this chapter was inserted into the text by a later author, possibly to fill a gap between the end of book 7 and the start of book 8. The veracity of this anecdote is therefore unclear.

====Hellenic alliance====
In 481 BC, Xerxes sent ambassadors to city states throughout Greece, asking for food, land, and water as tokens of their submission to Persia. However, Xerxes&#x27; ambassadors deliberately avoided Athens and Sparta, hoping thereby that those states would not learn of the Persians&#x27; plans. States that were opposed to Persia thus began to coalesce around these two city states. A congress of states met at Corinth in late autumn of 481 BC, and a confederate alliance of Greek city-states was formed. This confederation had powers both to send envoys to ask for assistance and to dispatch troops from the member states to defensive points after joint consultation. Herodotus does not formulate an abstract name for the union but simply calls them &quot;οἱ Ἕλληνες&quot; (the Greeks) and &quot;the Greeks who had sworn alliance&quot; (Godley translation) or &quot;the Greeks who had banded themselves together&quot; (Rawlinson translation). From here on, they will be referred to in this article as the &#x27;Allies&#x27;. Sparta and Athens had a leading role in the congress but the interests of all the states influenced defensive strategy. Little is known about the internal workings of the congress or the discussions during its meetings. Only 70 of the nearly 700 Greek city-states sent representatives. Nevertheless, this was remarkable for the disjointed Greek world, especially since many of the city-states present were still technically at war with one another.

==Second invasion of Greece (480–479 BC)==

===Early 480 BC: Thrace, Macedonia, and Thessaly===
Having crossed into Europe in April 480 BC, the Persian army began its march to Greece, taking 3 months to travel unopposed from the Hellespont to Therme. It paused at Doriskos where it was joined by the fleet. Xerxes reorganized the troops into tactical units replacing the national formations used earlier for the march.

The Allied &#x27;congress&#x27; met again in the spring of 480 BC and agreed to defend the narrow Vale of Tempe on the borders of Thessaly and block Xerxes&#x27;s advance. However, once there, they were warned by Alexander I of Macedon that the vale could be bypassed and that the army of Xerxes was overwhelmingly large, thus the Greeks retreated. Shortly afterwards, they received the news that Xerxes had crossed the Hellespont. At this point, a second strategy was suggested by Themistocles to the allies. The route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica and the Peloponnesus) would require the army of Xerxes to travel through the narrow pass of Thermopylae. This could easily be blocked by the Greek hoplites, despite the overwhelming numbers of Persians. Furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the Athenian and allied navies could block the straits of Artemisium. This dual strategy was adopted by the congress. However, the Peloponnesian cities made fall-back plans to defend the Isthmus of Corinth should it come to it, while the women and children of Athens were evacuated to the Peloponnesian city of Troezen.

===August 480 BC: Battles of Thermopylae and Artemisium===
Xerxes&#x27;s estimated time of arrival at Thermopylae coincided with both the Olympic Games and the festival of Carneia. For the Spartans, warfare during these periods was considered sacrilegious. Despite the uncomfortable timing, the Spartans considered the threat so grave that they dispatched their king Leonidas I with his personal bodyguard (the &quot;Hippeis&quot;) of 300 men. The customary elite young men in the Hippeis were replaced by veterans who already had children. Leonidas was supported by contingents from the Allied Peloponnesian cities, and other forces that the Allies picked up on the way to Thermopylae. The Allies proceeded to occupy the pass, rebuilt the wall the Phocians had built at the narrowest point of the pass, and waited for Xerxes&#x27;s arrival.

When the Persians arrived at Thermopylae in mid-August, they initially waited for three days for the Allies to disperse. When Xerxes was eventually persuaded that the Allies intended to contest the pass, he sent his troops to attack. However, the Allied position was ideally suited to hoplite warfare, the Persian contingents being forced to attack the Greek phalanx head on. The Allies withstood two full days of Persian attacks, including those by the elite Persian Immortals. However, towards the end of the second day, they were betrayed by a local resident named Ephialtes who revealed to Xerxes a mountain path that led behind the Allied lines, according to Herodotus. Herodotus has often been dismissed as a &#x27;story teller&#x27;, by Aristotle himself among others, and this may be a piece of folklore to create a more engaging narrative. In any case, it is impossible to determine with absolute certainty the legitimacy of Ephialtes&#x27; involvement in the battle. The Anopoea path was defended by roughly 1000 Phocians, according to Herodotus, who reportedly fled when confronted by the Persians. Made aware by scouts that they were being outflanked, Leonidas dismissed most of the Allied army, remaining to guard the rear with perhaps 2,000 men. On the final day of the battle, the remaining Allies sallied forth from the wall to meet the Persians in the wider part of the pass to slaughter as many Persians as they could, but eventually they were all killed or captured.

Simultaneous with the battle at Thermopylae, an Allied naval force of 271 triremes defended the Straits of Artemisium against the Persians, thus protecting the flank of the forces at Thermopylae. Here the Allied fleet held off the Persians for three days; however, on the third evening the Allies received news of the fate of Leonidas and the Allied troops at Thermopylae. Since the Allied fleet was badly damaged, and since it no longer needed to defend the flank of Thermopylae, the Allies retreated from Artemisium to the island of Salamis.


===September 480 BC: Battle of Salamis===

Victory at Thermopylae meant that all Boeotia fell to Xerxes; Attica was then open to invasion. The remaining population of Athens was evacuated, with the aid of the Allied fleet, to Salamis. The Peloponnesian Allies began to prepare a defensive line across the Isthmus of Corinth, building a wall, and demolishing the road from Megara, abandoning Athens to the Persians. Athens thus fell to the Persians; the small number of Athenians who had barricaded themselves on the Acropolis were eventually defeated, and Xerxes then ordered the destruction of Athens.

The Persians had now captured most of Greece, but Xerxes had perhaps not expected such defiance; his priority was now to complete the war as quickly as possible. If Xerxes could destroy the Allied navy, he would be in a strong position to force an Allied surrender; conversely by avoiding destruction, or as Themistocles hoped, by destroying the Persian fleet, the Allies could prevent conquest from being completed. The Allied fleet thus remained off the coast of Salamis into September, despite the imminent arrival of the Persians. Even after Athens fell, the Allied fleet remained off the coast of Salamis, trying to lure the Persian fleet to battle. Partly because of deception by Themistocles, the navies met in the cramped Straits of Salamis. There, the Persian numbers became a hindrance, as ships struggled to maneuver and became disorganised. Seizing the opportunity, the Allied fleet attacked, and scored a decisive victory, sinking or capturing at least 200 Persian ships, therefore ensuring the safety of the Peloponnessus.

According to Herodotus, after the loss of the battle Xerxes attempted to build a causeway across the channel to attack the Athenian evacuees on Salamis, but this project was soon abandoned. With the Persians&#x27; naval superiority removed, Xerxes feared that the Allies might sail to the Hellespont and destroy the pontoon bridges. His general Mardonius volunteered to remain in Greece and complete the conquest with a hand-picked group of troops, while Xerxes retreated to Asia with the bulk of the army. Mardonius over-wintered in Boeotia and Thessaly; the Athenians were thus able to return to their burnt-out city for the winter.

===June 479 BC: Battles of Plataea and Mycale===
Over the winter, there was some tension among the Allies. In particular, the Athenians, who were not protected by the Isthmus, but whose fleet was the key to the security of the Peloponnesus, felt that they had been treated unfairly, and so they refused to join the Allied navy in the spring. Mardonius remained in Thessaly, knowing an attack on the Isthmus was pointless, while the Allies refused to send an army outside the Peloponessus. Mardonius moved to break the stalemate, by offering peace to the Athenians, using Alexander I of Macedon as an intermediate. The Athenians made sure that a Spartan delegation was on hand to hear the Athenians reject the Persians&#x27; offer. Athens was thus evacuated again, and the Persians marched south and re-took possession of it. Mardonius now repeated his offer of peace to the Athenian refugees on Salamis. Athens, with Megara and Plataea, sent emissaries to Sparta demanding assistance, and threatening to accept the Persian terms if they were not aided. In response, the Spartans summoned a large army from the Peloponnese cities and marched to meet the Persians.

When Mardonius heard the Allied army was on the march, he retreated into Boeotia, near Plataea, trying to draw the Allies into open terrain where he could use his cavalry. The Allied army, under the command of the regent Pausanias, stayed on high ground above Plataea to protect themselves against such tactics. After several days of maneuver and stalemate, Pausanias ordered a night-time retreat towards the Allies&#x27; original positions. This maneuver went awry, leaving the Athenians, and Spartans and Tegeans isolated on separate hills, with the other contingents scattered further away near Plataea. Seeing that the Persians might never have a better opportunity to attack, Mardonius ordered his whole army forward. However, the Persian infantry proved no match for the heavily armoured Greek hoplites, and the Spartans broke through to Mardonius&#x27;s bodyguard and killed him. After this the Persian force dissolved in rout; 40,000 troops managed to escape via the road to Thessaly, but the rest fled to the Persian camp where they were trapped and slaughtered by the Greeks, finalising the Greek victory.

Herodotus recounts that, on the afternoon of the Battle of Plataea, a rumour of their victory at that battle reached the Allies&#x27; navy, at that time off the coast of Mount Mycale in Ionia. Their morale boosted, the Allied marines fought and won a decisive victory at the Battle of Mycale that same day, destroying the remnants of the Persian fleet, crippling Xerxes&#x27;s sea power, and marking the ascendancy of the Greek fleet. While many modern historians doubt that Mycale took place on the same day as Plataea, the battle may well only have occurred once the Allies received news of the events unfolding in Greece.

==Greek counterattack (479–478 BC)==
===Mycale and Ionia===
Mycale was, in many ways, the beginning of a new phase in the conflict, in which the Greeks would go on the offensive against the Persians. The immediate result of the victory at Mycale was a second revolt among the Greek cities of Asia Minor. The Samians and Milesians had actively fought against the Persians at Mycale, thus openly declaring their rebellion, and the other cities followed in their example.

===Sestos===
Shortly after Mycale, the Allied fleet sailed to the Hellespont to break down the pontoon bridges, but found that this had already been done. The Peloponnesians sailed home, but the Athenians remained to attack the Chersonesos, still held by the Persians. The Persians and their allies made for Sestos, the strongest town in the region. Among them was one Oeobazus of Cardia, who had with him the cables and other equipment from the pontoon bridges. The Persian governor, Artayctes had not prepared for a siege, not believing that the Allies would attack. The Athenians therefore were able to lay a siege around Sestos. The siege dragged on for several months, causing some discontent among the Athenian troops, but eventually, when the food ran out in the city, the Persians fled at night from the least guarded area of the city. The Athenians were thus able to take possession of the city the next day.

Most of the Athenian troops were sent straight away to pursue the Persians. The party of Oeobazus was captured by a Thracian tribe, and Oeobazus was sacrificed to the god Plistorus. The Athenians eventually caught Artayctes, killing some of the Persians with him but taking most of them, including Artayctes, captive. Artayctes was crucified at the request of the people of Elaeus, a town which Artayctes had plundered while governor of the Chersonesos. The Athenians, having pacified the region, then sailed back to Athens, taking the cables from the pontoon bridges with them as trophies.

===Cyprus===
In 478 BC, still operating under the terms of the Hellenic alliance, the Allies sent out a fleet composed of 20 Peloponnesian and 30 Athenian ships supported by an unspecified number of allies, under the overall command of Pausanias. According to Thucydides, this fleet sailed to Cyprus and &quot;subdued most of the island&quot;. Exactly what Thucydides means by this is unclear. Sealey suggests that this was essentially a raid to gather as much treasure as possible from the Persian garrisons on Cyprus. There is no indication that the Allies attempted to take possession of the island, and, shortly after, they sailed to Byzantium. Certainly, the fact that the Delian League repeatedly campaigned in Cyprus suggests either that the island was not garrisoned by the Allies in 478 BC, or that the garrisons were quickly expelled.

===Byzantium===
The Greek fleet then sailed to Byzantium, which they besieged and eventually captured. Control of both Sestos and Byzantium gave the allies command of the straits between Europe and Asia (over which the Persians had crossed), and allowed them access to the merchant trade of the Black Sea.

The aftermath of the siege was to prove troublesome for Pausanias the Regent. Exactly what happened is unclear; Thucydides gives few details, although later writers added plenty of lurid insinuations.

Through his arrogance and arbitrary actions (Thucydides says &quot;violence&quot;), Pausanias managed to alienate many of the Allied contingents, particularly those that had just been freed from Persian overlordship. The Ionians and others asked the Athenians to take leadership of the campaign, to which they agreed. The Spartans, hearing of his behaviour, recalled Pausanias and tried him on charges of collaborating with the enemy. Although he was acquitted, his reputation was tarnished and he was not restored to his command.

Pausanias returned to Byzantium as a private citizen in 477 BC, and took command of the city until he was expelled by the Athenians. He then crossed the Bosporus and settled in Kolonai in the Troad, until he was again accused of collaborating with the Persians and was recalled by the Spartans for a trial after which he starved himself to death.

The timescale is unclear, but Pausanias may have remained in possession of Byzantium until 470 BC.

In the meantime, the Spartans had sent Dorkis to Byzantium with a small force, to take command of the Allied force. However, he found that the rest of the Allies were no longer prepared to accept Spartan leadership, and therefore returned home.

==Wars of the Delian League (477–449 BC)==
===Delian League===


After Byzantium, the Spartans were allegedly eager to end their involvement in the war. The Spartans were supposedly of the view that, with the liberation of mainland Greece and the Greek cities of Asia Minor, the war&#x27;s purpose had already been reached. There was also perhaps a feeling that securing long-term security for the Asian Greeks would prove impossible. In the aftermath of Mycale, the Spartan king Leotychides had proposed transplanting all the Greeks from Asia Minor to Europe as the only method of permanently freeing them from Persian dominion. Xanthippus, the Athenian commander at Mycale, had furiously rejected this; the Ionian cities were originally Athenian colonies, and the Athenians, if no one else, would protect the Ionians. This marks the point at which the leadership of the Greek Alliance effectively passed to the Athenians. With the Spartan withdrawal after Byzantium, the leadership of the Athenians became explicit.

The loose alliance of city-states that had fought against Xerxes&#x27;s invasion had been dominated by Sparta and the Peloponnesian league. With the withdrawal of these states, a congress was called on the holy island of Delos to institute a new alliance to continue the fight against the Persians. This alliance, now including many of the Aegean islands, was formally constituted as the
&#x27;First Athenian Alliance&#x27;, commonly known as the Delian League. According to Thucydides, the official aim of the League was to &quot;avenge the wrongs they suffered by ravaging the territory of the king&quot;. In reality, this goal was divided into three main efforts—to prepare for future invasion, to seek revenge against Persia, and to organize a means of dividing spoils of war. The members were given a choice of either supplying armed forces or paying a tax to the joint treasury; most states chose the tax.

===Campaigns against Persia===


Throughout the 470s BC, the Delian League campaigned in Thrace and the Aegean to remove the remaining Persian garrisons from the region, primarily under the command of the Athenian politician Cimon. In the early part of the next decade, Cimon began campaigning in Asia Minor, seeking to strengthen the Greek position there. At the Battle of the Eurymedon in Pamphylia, the Athenians and allied fleet achieved a stunning double victory, destroying a Persian fleet and then landing the ships&#x27; marines to attack and rout the Persian army. After this battle, the Persians took an essentially passive role in the conflict, anxious not to risk battle if possible.

Towards the end of the 460s BC, the Athenians took the ambitious decision to support a revolt in the Egyptian satrapy of the Persian empire. Although the Greek task force achieved initial successes, they were unable to capture the Persian garrison in Memphis, despite a three-year long siege. The Persians then counterattacked, and the Athenian force was itself besieged for 18 months, before being wiped out. This disaster, coupled with ongoing warfare in Greece, dissuaded the Athenians from resuming conflict with Persia. In 451 BC however, a truce was agreed in Greece, and Cimon was then able to lead an expedition to Cyprus. However, while besieging Kition, Cimon died, and the Athenian force decided to withdraw, winning another double victory at the Battle of Salamis-in-Cyprus to extricate themselves. This campaign marked the end of hostilities between the Delian League and Persia, and therefore the end of the Greco-Persian Wars.

==Peace with Persia==
After the Battle of Salamis-in-Cyprus, Thucydides makes no further mention of conflict with the Persians, saying that the Greeks simply returned home. Diodorus, on the other hand, claims that in the aftermath of Salamis, a proper peace treaty (the &quot;Peace of Callias&quot;) was agreed with the Persians. Diodorus was probably following the history of Ephorus at this point, who in turn was presumably influenced by his teacher Isocrates—from whom there is the earliest reference to the supposed peace, in 380 BC. Even during the 4th century BC, the idea of the treaty was controversial, and two authors from that period, Callisthenes and Theopompus, appear to reject its existence.

It is possible that the Athenians had attempted to negotiate with the Persians previously. Plutarch suggests that in the aftermath of the victory at the Eurymedon, Artaxerxes had agreed to a peace treaty with the Greeks, even naming Callias as the Athenian ambassador involved. However, as Plutarch admits, Callisthenes denied that such a peace was made at this point (c. 466 BC). Herodotus also mentions, in passing, an Athenian embassy headed by Callias, which was sent to Susa to negotiate with Artaxerxes. This embassy included some Argive representatives and can probably be therefore dated to c. 461 BC (after an alliance was agreed between Athens and Argos). This embassy may have been an attempt to reach some kind of peace agreement, and it has even been suggested that the failure of these hypothetical negotiations led to the Athenian decision to support the Egyptian revolt. The ancient sources therefore disagree as to whether there was an official peace or not, and, if there was, when it was agreed.

Opinion among modern historians is also split; for instance, Fine accepts the concept of the Peace of Callias, whereas Sealey effectively rejects it. Holland accepts that some kind of accommodation was made between Athens and Persia, but no actual treaty. Fine argues that Callisthenes&#x27;s denial that a treaty was made after the Eurymedon does not preclude a peace being made at another point. Further, he suggests that Theopompus was actually referring to a treaty that had allegedly been negotiated with Persia in 423 BC. If these views are correct, it would remove one major obstacle to the acceptance of the treaty&#x27;s existence. A further argument for the existence of the treaty is the sudden withdrawal of the Athenians from Cyprus in 449 BC, which Fine suggests makes most sense in the light of some kind of peace agreement. On the other hand, if there was indeed some kind of accommodation, Thucydides&#x27;s failure to mention it is odd. In his digression on the &quot;pentekontaetia&quot;, his aim is to explain the growth of Athenian power, and such a treaty, and the fact that the Delian allies were not released from their obligations after it, would have marked a major step in the Athenian ascendancy. Conversely, it has been suggested that certain passages elsewhere in Thucydides&#x27;s history are best interpreted as referring to a peace agreement. There is thus no clear consensus among modern historians as to the treaty&#x27;s existence.

The ancient sources that give details of the treaty are reasonably consistent in their description of the terms:
* All Greek cities of Asia were to &#x27;live by their own laws&#x27; &quot;or&quot; &#x27;be autonomous&#x27; (depending on translation).
* Persian satraps (and presumably their armies) were not to travel west of the Halys River (Isocrates) &quot;or&quot; closer than a day&#x27;s journey on horseback to the Aegean Sea (Callisthenes) &quot;or&quot; closer than three days&#x27; journey on foot to the Aegean Sea (Ephorus and Diodorus).
* No Persian warship was to sail west of Phaselis (on the southern coast of Asia Minor), nor west of the Cyanaean rocks (probably at the eastern end of the Bosporus, on the north coast).
* If the terms were observed by the king and his generals, then the Athenians were not to send troops to lands ruled by Persia.

From the Persian perspective, such terms would not be so humiliating as they might at first seem. The Persians already agreed that the Greek cities of Asia would remain governed under their own laws (under the reorganization conducted by Artaphernes, following the Ionian Revolt). By these terms, the Ionians were still Persian subjects, as they had been. Furthermore, Athens had already demonstrated their superiority at sea at the Eurymedon and Salamis-in-Cyprus, so any legal limitations for the Persian fleet were nothing more than &quot;de jure&quot; recognition of military realities. In exchange for limiting the movement of Persian troops in one region of the realm, Artaxerxes secured a promise from the Athenians to stay out of his entire realm.

==Aftermath and later conflicts==
Towards the end of the conflict with Persia, the process by which the Delian League became the Athenian Empire reached its conclusion. The allies of Athens were not released from their obligations to provide either money or ships, despite the cessation of hostilities. In Greece, the First Peloponnesian War between the power-blocs of Athens and Sparta, which had continued on/off since 460 BC, finally ended in 445 BC, with the agreement of a thirty-year truce. However, the growing enmity between Sparta and Athens would lead, just 14 years later, into the outbreak of the Second Peloponnesian War. This disastrous conflict, which dragged on for 27 years, would eventually result in the utter destruction of Athenian power, the dismemberment of the Athenian empire, and the establishment of a Spartan hegemony over Greece. However, not just Athens suffered—the conflict would significantly weaken the whole of Greece.

Repeatedly defeated in battle by the Greeks, and plagued by internal rebellions that hindered their ability to fight the Greeks, after 449 BC, Artaxerxes I and his successors instead adopted a policy of divide-and-rule. Avoiding fighting the Greeks themselves, the Persians instead attempted to set Athens against Sparta, regularly bribing politicians to achieve their aims. In this way, they ensured that the Greeks remained distracted by internal conflicts, and were unable to turn their attentions to Persia. There was no open conflict between the Greeks and Persia until 396 BC, when the Spartan king Agesilaus briefly invaded Asia Minor; as Plutarch points out, the Greeks were far too busy overseeing the destruction of their own power to fight against the &quot;barbarians&quot;.

If the wars of the Delian League shifted the balance of power between Greece and Persia in favour of the Greeks, then the subsequent half-century of internecine conflict in Greece did much to restore the balance of power to Persia. The Persians entered the Peloponnesian War in 411 BC forming a mutual-defence pact with Sparta and combining their naval resources against Athens in exchange for sole Persian control of Ionia. In 404 BC when Cyrus the Younger attempted to seize the Persian throne, he recruited 13,000 Greek mercenaries from all over the Greek world, of which Sparta sent 700–800, believing they were following the terms of the defence pact and unaware of the army&#x27;s true purpose. After the failure of Cyrus, Persia tried to regain control of the Ionian city-states, which had rebelled during the conflict. The Ionians refused to capitulate and called upon Sparta for assistance, which she provided, in 396–395 BC. Athens, however, sided with the Persians, which led in turn to another large-scale conflict in Greece, the Corinthian War. Towards the end of that conflict, in 387 BC, Sparta sought the aid of Persia to shore up her position. Under the so-called &quot;King&#x27;s Peace&quot; that brought the war to an end, Artaxerxes II demanded and received the return of the cities of Asia Minor from the Spartans, in return for which the Persians threatened to make war on any Greek state that did not make peace. This humiliating treaty, which undid all the Greek gains of the previous century, sacrificed the Greeks of Asia Minor so that the Spartans could maintain their hegemony over Greece. It is in the aftermath of this treaty that Greek orators began to refer to the Peace of Callias (whether fictional or not), as a counterpoint to the shame of the King&#x27;s Peace, and a glorious example of the &quot;good old days&quot; when the Greeks of the Aegean had been freed from Persian rule by the Delian League.

<text>Asian values is a political ideology that attempts to define elements of society, culture and history common to the nations of Southeast and East Asia, particularly values of commonality and collectivism for social unity and economic good — contrasting with perceived European ideals of the universal rights of all individuals.

== Definition ==
Various definitions of &quot;Asian values&quot; have been put forth. Generally, the phrase alludes to influences by Confucianism, in particular, filial piety or loyalty towards the family, corporation, and nation; the forgoing of personal freedom for the sake of society&#x27;s stability and prosperity; the pursuit of academic and technological excellence; and, a strong work ethic together with thrift.

Supporters of Chinese-style authoritarian governments claim that Asian values are more appropriate for the region than Western democracy with its emphasis on individual freedoms.

&quot;Asian values&quot; were codified and promoted in the Bangkok Declaration of 1993, which re-emphasized the principles of sovereignty, self-determination, and non-interference in civil and political rights. They included:
* Preference for social harmony;
* Concern with socio-economic prosperity and the collective well-being of the community;
* Loyalty and respect towards figures of authority;
* Preference for collectivism and communitarianism.

== History ==
Historically, there has been no shared &quot;Asian&quot; identity, and the concept of unified geographical regional identity at the time of its popularity in the 20th century was not strictly limited to Asia. 

Asian values gained popularity in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the Republic of China (under the Kuomintang), Malaysia (under Mahathir Mohamad), Singapore (under Lee Kuan Yew), Indonesia, South Korea and in Japan (perhaps as early as the pre World War II era). In the West, the study of Asian values was seen as a way to understand Asia and foster a closer relationship with the region.

Proponents claim the concept helped reconcile Islam, Confucianism and Hinduism in Singapore and Malaysia, and was unifying because it was different to the philosophy of the West. Lee Kuan Yew maintained that, more than economics or politics, a nation&#x27;s culture determines its fate, describing Asian values as the &quot;primacy of group interests over individual interests&quot; which &quot;support the total group effort necessary to develop rapidly&quot;. He described the difference between Asian values and Western values as such: &quot;The main object is to have a well-ordered society so that everybody can have maximum enjoyment of his freedoms. This freedom can only exist in an ordered state and not in a natural state of contention and anarchy&quot;.

In Japan, a concept of &quot;Ideals of the East&quot; was embraced in some nationalist circles, because it challenged the West and offered the possibility of Japanese leadership in a &quot;new Asia&quot;. Some attribute the economic success of East and Southeast Asian nations in the 1960s to 1980s to &quot;Asian values&quot; — a &quot;third-way&quot;, Asian political model that was an alternative to totalitarianism and liberal democracy. Japan&#x27;s economic miracle under the 1955 System, where the Liberal Democratic Party has been the dominant Japanese party nearly continuously in power since 1955, is used as an example of the success of this political model.

The concept of &quot;Asian values&quot; was also evident in the planning of the handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997.

=== Post-2000 ===
The popularity of the concept has not persist. Some speculate it might have contributed to the religious, social, cultural and economic changes occurring in Asia in that time — for example, the Asian financial crisis and the collapse of the Suharto regime in Indonesia may have been successfully counteracted by liberal democracy.

In 2006, Jusuf Kalla, the vice-president of Indonesia, linked Asian values with the proposed East Asian Free Trade Agreement and the East Asian Community arising from the East Asia Summit. He partly defended Asian values by placing emphasis on co-operation over competition.

In East Timor, the idea of &quot;Asian values&quot;, or &quot;Timorese values&quot;, that diverged from the internationally understood idea of democracy emerged following the 2012 East Timorese presidential election. This election saw the incumbent José Ramos-Horta, a member of what was seen as an older generation linked to the introduction of democracy, eliminated in the first round. Ramos-Horta would, however, go on to win the presidency again a decade later, following a campaign aimed at addressing global issues affecting East Timor.

&quot;Asian values&quot; continues to be discussed in academia with reference to the question of the universality of human rights, as opposed to a position of cultural relativism.

== Criticism ==
A number of criticisms of Asian values have been made. 

Kim Dae-jung (former President of South Korea), Amartya Kumar Sen (Indian economist, philosopher, and Nobel laureate) and Yu Ying-shih (Chinese-born American historian and sinologist) have argued that &quot;Asian values&quot; and the protection thereof by cultural relativism is doublespeak for suppressing freedom of speech and human rights, which are framed by proponents as &quot;Western values&quot; inapplicable to Asian society. Randall Peerenboom noted that many scholars &quot;are in general agreement that some Asian governments use the rhetoric of Asian values for self-serving ends.&quot; Amartya Sen argues these so-called Asian values cannot operate because of the overriding cultural diversity found in Asia.

In 2001, Mark R. Thompson argued that the popularity of the concept waned after the 1997 Asian financial crisis, when it became evident that Asia lacked any coherent regional institutional mechanism to deal with the crisis.

The authors of a study published in 2015 claimed that rice versus wheat agriculture explain differences in analytic thinking, &quot;implicit individualism&quot; and innovation between various Chinese provinces. Compared to wheat farming, rice farming is a labor-intensive practice that requires cooperation among many people. However, the results of the study are controversial due to very small sample sizes for some units of analysis, questionable measurement instruments and model misspecification. Using an improved measure of individualism-collectivism, the authors of a replication study found that the conclusion of the 2015 article claiming to show evidence for the relationship between wheat versus rice farming was the result of faulty methodology.

<text>The Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (c. 9) is an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that altered the laws on granting of planning permission for building works, notably including those of the listed building system in England and Wales.

The act no longer has effect in Wales, its provisions having been repealed and replaced there by the Historic Environment (Wales) Act 2023.

==Secondary legislation==
The &#x27; (SI 2009/2711) were made on 6 October 2009 and came into force on 2 November 2009. They amend the &#x27; (SI 1990/1519) as amended, by substituting schedule 4 of the 1990 regulations (notices that a building has become listed or that a building has ceased to be listed), to reflect the fact that Historic England now compiles lists of buildings of special architectural or historic interest and the Secretary of State is responsible for approving them.

<text>In some schools of Buddhism, bardo ( Wylie: &quot;bar do&quot;) or antarābhava (Sanskrit, Chinese and Japanese: 中有, romanized in Chinese as &quot;zhōng yǒu&quot; and in Japanese as &quot;chū&#x27;u&quot;) is an intermediate, transitional, or liminal state between death and rebirth. The concept arose soon after Gautama Buddha&#x27;s death, with a number of earlier Buddhist schools accepting the existence of such an intermediate state, while other schools rejected it. The concept of &quot;antarābhava&quot;, an intervening state between death and rebirth, was brought into Buddhism from the Vedic-Upanishadic (later Hindu) philosophical tradition. Later Buddhism expanded the bardo concept to six or more states of consciousness covering every stage of life and death. In Tibetan Buddhism, &quot;bardo&quot; is the central theme of the &quot;Bardo Thodol&quot; (literally &quot;Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State&quot;), the &quot;Tibetan Book of the Dead&quot;, a text intended to both guide the recently deceased person through the death bardo to gain a better rebirth and also to help their loved ones with the grieving process.

Used without qualification, &quot;bardo&quot; is the state of existence intermediate between two lives on earth. According to Tibetan tradition, after death and before one&#x27;s next birth, when one&#x27;s consciousness is not connected with a physical body, one experiences a variety of phenomena. These usually follow a particular sequence of degeneration from, just after death, the clearest experiences of reality of which one is spiritually capable, and then proceeding to terrifying hallucinations that arise from the impulses of one&#x27;s previous unskillful actions. For the prepared and appropriately trained individuals, the bardo offers a state of great opportunity for liberation, since transcendental insight may arise with the direct experience of reality; for others, it can become a place of danger as the karmically created hallucinations can impel one into a less than desirable rebirth.

Metaphorically, &quot;bardo&quot; can be used to describe times when the usual way of life becomes suspended, as, for example, during a period of illness or during a meditation retreat. Such times can prove fruitful for spiritual progress because external constraints diminish. However, they can also present challenges because our less skillful impulses may come to the foreground, just as in the &quot;sidpa bardo&quot;.

==Intermediate state in Indian Buddhism==

From the records of early Buddhist schools, it appears that at least six different groups accepted the notion of an intermediate existence (&quot;antarabhāva&quot;), namely, the Sarvāstivāda, Darṣṭāntika, Vātsīputrīyas, Saṃmitīya, Pūrvaśaila and late Mahīśāsaka. The first four of these are closely related schools. Opposing them were the Mahāsāṃghika, early Mahīśāsaka, Theravāda, Vibhajyavāda and the &quot;Śāriputrābhidharma&quot; (possibly Dharmagupta).

Some of the earliest references to an &quot;intermediate existence&quot; are to be found in the Sarvāstivādin text the Mahāvibhāṣa (阿毘達磨大毘婆沙論). For instance, the Mahāvibhāṣa indicates a &quot;basic existence&quot; (本有), an &quot;intermediate existence&quot; (中有), a &quot;birth existence&quot; (生有) and a &quot;death existence&quot; (死有) (CBETA, T27, no. 1545, p. 959, etc.). André Bareau&#x27;s &quot;Les sectes bouddhiques du Petit Véhicule&quot; provides the arguments of the Sarvāstivāda schools as follows:

The intermediate being who makes the passage in this way from one existence to the next is formed, like every living being, of the five aggregates (skandha). His existence is demonstrated by the fact that it cannot have any discontinuity in time and space between the place and moment of death and those of rebirth, and therefore it must be that the two existences belonging to the same series are linked in time and space by an intermediate stage. The intermediate being is the Gandharva, the presence of which is as necessary at conception as the fecundity and union of the parents. Furthermore, the Antarāparinirvāyin is an Anāgamin who obtains parinirvāṇa during the intermediary existence. As for the heinous criminal guilty of one of the five crimes without interval (ānantarya), he passes in quite the same way by an intermediate existence at the end of which he is reborn necessarily in hell.

Deriving from a later period of the same school, though with some differences, Vasubandhu&#x27;s &quot;Abhidharmakośa&quot; explains (English trs. p. 383ff):

What is an intermediate being, and an intermediate existence? Intermediate existence, which inserts itself between existence at death and existence at birth, not having arrived at the location where it should go, cannot be said to be born. Between death—that is, the five skandhas of the moment of death—and arising—that is, the five skandhas of the moment of rebirth—there is found an existence—a &quot;body&quot; of five skandhas—that goes to the place of rebirth. This existence between two realms of rebirth (gatī) is called intermediate existence.

He cites a number of texts and examples to defend the notion against other schools which reject it and claim that death in one life is immediately followed by rebirth in the next, without any intermediate state in between the two. Both the &quot;Mahāvibhāṣa&quot; and the &quot;Abhidharmakośa&quot; have the notion of the intermediate state lasting &quot;seven times seven days&quot; (i.e. 49 days) at most. This is one view, though, and there were also others.

Similar arguments were also used in Harivarman&#x27;s *&quot;Satyasiddhi Śāstra&quot;, and the Upadeśa commentary on the &quot;Prajñāpāramitā&quot; Sūtras, both of which have strong influence from the Sarvāstivāda school. Both of these texts had powerful influence in Chinese Buddhism, which also accepts this idea as a rule.

The &quot;Saddharma-smṛty-upasthāna Sūtra&quot; (正法念處經) classifies 17 intermediate states with different experiences.

==Six bardos in Tibetan Buddhism==

Fremantle (2001) states that there are six traditional bardo states known as the Six Bardos: the Bardo of This Life (p. 55); the Bardo of Meditation (p. 58); the Bardo of Dream (p. 62); the Bardo of Dying (p. 64); the Bardo of Dharmata (p. 65); and the Bardo of Existence (p. 66).

Shugchang, &quot;et al.&quot; (2000: p. 5) discuss the Zhitro (Tibetan: Zhi-khro) cycle of teachings of Karma Lingpa which includes the &quot;Bardo Thodol&quot; and list the Six Bardo: &quot;The first bardo begins when we take birth and endures as long as we live. The second is the bardo of dreams. The third is the bardo of concentration or meditation. The fourth occurs at the moment of death. The fifth is known as the bardo of the luminosity of the true nature. The sixth is called the bardo of transmigration or karmic becoming.


=== History ===
Since the Bardo Thodol was translated into English, different conceptions of the bardo have emerged over the years (Lopez, 1998: p. 43 and 83). In the translation of Walter Y. Evans-Wentz in 1927, the description of the bardo was an &quot;esoteric&quot; view of rebirth as an evolutionary system in which regression to the brutish realms was impossible. Almost four decades later, in 1964, Timothy Leary, Ralph Metzner and Richard Alpert saw the intermediate states as being really about life, profitable as an account of an eight-hour acid trip. Chögyam Trungpa portrays the realms of rebirth as psychological states in 1975, and Sogyal Rinpoche uses his discussion of the six realms as an opportunity to lampoon California surfers and New York bankers, in the translation that was published in 1992. Two years later Robert Thurman (1994) interpreted the bardo, which is described originally as a Nyingma text, from a Geluk frame.

Fremantle (2001: p. 53–54) charts the development of the bardo concept through the Himalayan tradition:

Originally bardo referred only to the period between one life and the next, and this is still its normal meaning when it is mentioned without any qualification. There was considerable dispute over this theory during the early centuries of Buddhism, with one side arguing that rebirth (or conception) follows immediately after death, and the other saying that there must be an interval between the two. With the rise of mahayana, belief in a transitional period prevailed. Later Buddhism expanded the whole concept to distinguish six or more similar states, covering the whole cycle of life, death, and rebirth. But it can also be interpreted as any transitional experience, any state that lies between two other states. Its original meaning, the experience of being between death and rebirth, is the prototype of the bardo experience, while the six traditional bardos show how the essential qualities of that experience are also present in other transitional periods. By refining even further the understanding of the essence of bardo, it can then be applied to every moment of existence. The present moment, the now, is a continual bardo, always suspended between the past and the future. Yongey Mingur Rinpoche (2021, p. 66) adds another modern view and emphasises on the bardo of becoming: &quot;When we move past the convenience of language and categories, every second manifests the bardo of becoming. Becoming and becoming. All phenomena always just become [...] When we sensitize ourselves to the subtle transitions of emotions, or of bodily change, or shifts in social circumstances, or environmental transformations such as differences in landscape and light, or developments in language, art, or politics-we see that it&#x27;s all always changing, dying, and becoming.&quot;

== Intermediate state in Theravāda ==
Theravāda Abhidhamma texts like the &quot;Kathavatthu&quot; traditionally reject the view that there is an intermediate or transitional state (&quot;antarabhāva&quot;) between rebirths, they hold that rebirth happens instantaneously (in one mind moment) through the re-linking consciousness (&quot;patisandhi citta&quot;).

However, as has been noted by various modern scholars like Bhikkhu Sujato, there are passages in the Theravāda Pali Canon which support the idea of an intermediate state, the most explicit of which is the &quot;Kutuhalasāla Sutta&quot;.

This sutta states: [The Buddha:] &quot;Vaccha, I declare that there is rebirth for one with fuel [with grasping], not for one without fuel. Vaccha, just as fire burns with fuel, not without fuel, even so, Vaccha, I declare that there is rebirth for one with fuel [with grasping], not for one without fuel.&quot;

[Vaccha replies:] &quot;But, master Gotama, when a flame is tossed by the wind and goes a long way, what does master Gotama declare to be its fuel?&quot;

[Buddha:] &quot;Vaccha, when a flame is tossed by the wind and goes a long way, I declare that it is fueled by the air. For, Vaccha, at that time, the air is the fuel.&quot;

[Vaccha:] &quot;Master Gotama, when a being has laid down this body, but has not yet been reborn in another body, what does the master Gotama declare to be the fuel?&quot;

[Buddha:] &quot;Vaccha, when a being has laid down this body, but has not yet been reborn in another body, it is fuelled by craving, I say. For, Vaccha, at that time, craving is the fuel.&quot; Furthermore, some Theravāda scholars (such as Balangoda Ananda Maitreya) have defended the idea of an intermediate state and it is also a very common belief among some monks and laypersons in the Theravāda world (where it is commonly referred to as the &quot;gandhabba&quot; or &quot;antarabhāva&quot;). According to Sujato, it is also widely accepted among Thai forest tradition teachers.

== In East Asian Buddhism ==
East Asian Buddhism generally accepts the main doctrines of the Yogacara tradition as taught by Vasubandhu and Asanga. This includes the acceptance of the intermediate existence (中有, Chinese romanization: &quot;zhōng yǒu&quot;, Japanese: ). The doctrine of the intermediate existence is mentioned in various Chinese Buddhist scholastic works, such as Xuanzang&#x27;s &quot;Cheng Weishi Lun&quot; (&quot;Discourse on the Perfection of Consciousness-only).&quot;

The Chinese Buddhist Canon contains a text called the &quot;Antarabhava sutra,&quot; which is used in funerary rituals.

The founder of Soto Zen, Dogen, wrote the following regarding how to navigate the intermediate state:&quot;When you leave this life, and before you enter the next life, there is a place called an intermediary realm. You stay there for seven days. You should resolve to keep chanting the names of the three treasures without ceasing while you are there. After seven days you die in the intermediary realm and remain there for no more than seven days. At this time you can see and hear without hindrance, like having a celestial eye. Resolve to encourage yourself to keep chanting the names of the three treasures without ceasing: &#x27;I take refuge in the Buddha. I take refuge in the Dharma. I take refuge in the Sangha.&#x27; After passing through the intermediary realm, when you approach your parents to be conceived, resolve to maintain authentic wisdom. Keep chanting refuge in the three treasures in your mother&#x27;s womb. Do not neglect chanting while you are given birth. Resolve deeply to dedicate yourself to chant and take refuge in the three treasures through the six sense roots. When your life ends, your eye sight will suddenly become dark. Know that this is the end of your life and be determined to chant, &#x27;I take refuge in the buddha.&#x27; Then, all buddhas in the ten directions will show compassion to you. Even if due to conditions you are bound to an unwholesome realm, you will be able to be born in the deva realm or in the presence of the Buddha. Bow and listen to the Buddha.&quot;

<text>Madí—also known as Jamamadí after one of its dialects, and also Kapaná or Kanamanti (Canamanti)—is an Arawan language spoken by about 1,000 Jamamadi, Banawá, and Jarawara people scattered over Amazonas, Brazil.

The language has an active–stative clause structure with an agent–object–verb or object–agent–verb word order, depending on whether the agent or object is the topic of discussion (AOV appears to be the default).

== Dialects ==
Madí (meaning simply &quot;people&quot;) has three extant dialects, corresponding to three distinct tribal groups. Dialectal differences are an important part of tribal self-identification, and although all three dialects are mutually intelligible Madí speakers refer to them as separate languages. The dialects and the tribes they represent are as follows:

# Jamamadí, spoken by 250 people to the northwest. As the most widely spoken dialect, &quot;Jamamadí&quot; is sometimes used to refer to the whole Madí-speaking population by outsiders and the neighboring Paumarí. The term, used by the Jamamadí people themselves, is a compound of &quot;forest&quot; and &quot;people&quot;. This tribe is occasionally confused with another self-identified &quot;Jamamadí&quot; living further up the Purus River, who in fact speak a dialect of Kulina. The Jarawara use the word and the Banawá to refer to the Jamamadí, both possibly meaning &quot;liver&quot;.
# Jarawara, spoken by about 170 in seven villages to the south. This term - which was originally used only by outsiders, but today used in self-reference when speaking to non-Madí - is a compound of the Lingua Geral &quot;white person&quot; and &quot;to eat&quot;. The Jarawara refer to themselves as , &quot;us real people&quot;. The Banawá refer to them as ; the Jamamadí call them , &quot;palm-tree&quot;.
# Banawá, spoken by about 120 to the northeast. This term is simply the Brazilian-Portuguese name for the river the tribe now lives on; they themselves refer to the river as , and the tribe as , &quot;those who belong to the Kitia&quot;. The Banawá only recently migrated to the river area, in about 1950; prior to this they were known as the . Both the Jarawara and Jamamadí refer to the Banawá as .

These three dialects share 95% of their vocabulary, and their grammars are nearly identical. Dixon characterizes Jarawara and Banawá as somewhat closer to each other than either is to Jamamadí, analogous to the standard British, Australian and American varieties of English. The three tribes have relatively little long-term interaction with one another; close personal relations, social events, and marriages generally occur only within a given tribe. As a result, there is no particular prestige dialect of Madí, and in fact all the native terms for other dialects described above are slightly derogatory.

Of the three Madí dialects, Jarawara is the most thoroughly documented; as such, this article will refer to Jarawara unless otherwise indicated.

==Phonology and orthography==
Madí has a relatively small phonemic inventory, distinguishing four vowel qualities and twelve consonants.

===Vowels===

# The back vowel here represented as /o oː/ is unrounded; its most common realization is mid-back [ɤ ɤː], but this varies freely with close-back [ɯ ɯː].
All vowel qualities may occur short or long, but the distinction is fairly limited and has a low functional load. All monosyllabic words have a long vowel: /baː/ &quot;to hit&quot;, /soː/ &quot;to urinate&quot;. In polysyllabic words, however, vowel length is occasionally contrastive, as shown in the minimal pair /ˈaba/ &quot;fish&quot; and /ˈaːba/ &quot;to be finished, dead&quot;. Many instances of long vowels developed historically from the loss of /h/ preceding an unstressed syllable, a process that is still ongoing; for example, the citation form /ˈaha/ &quot;water&quot; may be pronounced /aː/ in casual speech.

Vowels are allophonically nasalized when adjacent to nasal consonants /m n h/, and at the end of main clauses.

===Consonants===

# The voiced alveolar stop /d/ occurs in the Jamamadí and Banawá dialects; in Jarawara it has merged with /t/.
# The palatal stop may be realized as a semivowel in rapid speech, and especially before /i/.
# The glottal stop has a limited distribution. It occurs between the elements of a compound where the second element begins with a vowel, e.g. /iso-ete/ &quot;leg-stalk&quot; &gt; [isoʔete] &quot;shin&quot;. Similarly, it occurs after reduplication when the reduplicated stem begins with a vowel: /ata-atabo/ &quot;be muddy all over&quot; is realized as [ataʔatabo]. Dixon therefore argues that the glottal stop is not a phoneme in its own right, but rather marks a &quot;phonological&quot; word boundary occurring within a &quot;grammatical&quot; word, when the following phonological word begins in a vowel.
# The glottal fricative /h/ is nasalized - that is, air escapes from both the mouth and nose while it is articulated - and is therefore represented here as &lt;&gt;. This causes the allophonic nasalization of surrounding vowels mentioned above (see rhinoglottophilia).
# The most common realization of the liquid /r/ in Jarawara is a &quot;darkish&quot; lateral approximant [l~ɫ]; a tap [ɾ] occurs as an allophone, most commonly before /i/. In Jamamadí and Banawá, however, this consonant is realized as [ɾ] in most contexts.
# The semivowel /w/ cannot occur, or is non-distinctive, before or after the back vowel /o oː/. As a result, it is often analysed as a non-syllabic allophone of /o/.

The Jarawara dialect does not distinguish voicing in any of its consonants. It is cross-linguistically unusual, however, in that voicing in its stop series is asymmetrical; /t k/ are underlyingly voiceless, whereas /b ɟ/ are underlyingly voiced. All except /ɟ/ have occasional voiced or voiceless allophones, i.e. /p d g/; voiced allophones often occur word-initially, and voiceless allophones tend to occur word-medially. This system is the result of several mergers occurring in the transition from Proto-Arawan, which had a much larger consonant inventory. The latter system is mostly preserved in the modern Arawan language Paumarí.

=== Syllables and stress ===
In common with many other Amazonian languages, Madí has a very simple syllable structure (C)V; that is, a syllable must consist of a vowel, which may be preceded by a consonant. All consonant-vowel sequences are permitted except . VV sequences are heavily restricted; aside from /oV Vo/ (which may also be transcribed /owV Vwo/, with an intervening consonant), sequences where /h/ is deleted before an unstressed vowel, and the recent loanword &quot;day&quot; (from Portuguese ), the only permitted sequence is . Words cannot begin with VV sequences, except when is deleted from the sequence /VhV-/.

In the Jarawara dialect, stress is assigned to every second mora counting from the end of the phonological word, beginning with the penultimate, e.g. &quot;tape recorder&quot;. Since long vowels bear two moras, they are always stressed: &quot;priest&quot;.

In Banawá, however, stress is counted from the beginning of the word: the first (in words of two moras) or second (in words of three or more) mora is stressed, along with every second mora following. Jamamadi may share this system.

=== Orthography ===
Like all indigenous languages of South America, Madí was not written prior to Euro-American contact; moreover, no officially standardized orthography yet exists for the language, and most native speakers are illiterate. The basis for written representation of the language today, both among native and non-native speakers, is a practical orthography devised by SIL for the Jamamadí dialect. The differences between the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), the SIL orthography for Jamamadí, and Dixon&#x27;s orthography for Jarawara are listed below.

This article, which focuses mostly on the Jarawara dialect, will henceforth use Dixon&#x27;s practical orthography even when discussing Jamamadí and Banawá.

== Grammar ==

=== Grammatical profile ===
Like many indigenous languages of the Americas, Madí is grammatically agglutinative, primarily suffixing, and &quot;verb-heavy&quot;; that is, a great deal of grammatical information is conveyed through verbal affixes, with each affix generally corresponding to a single morpheme. Dixon, for example, counts six prefixes and over eighty affixes. The Jarawara sentence below provides an example of a highly inflected verb, with six affixes corresponding to eight independent words in English (lexical roots are highlighted in bold): 

On the other hand, all verbal affixes are optional, and many verbs occur in speech with three affixes or fewer; as a result, the actual morpheme-per-word ratio is lower than the large inventory of affixes might suggest. Other word classes, moreover, inflect with far less regularity and variety than verbs do. As a result, while theoretically possible, single-word sentences such as those characteristic of polysynthetic languages are rare in Madí.

Madí displays a &quot;fluid-S&quot; active-stative alignment system and a basic object-subject-verb (OSV) word order. The latter feature is shared by other regional languages (e.g. Apurinã) but is very rare cross-linguistically.

=== Gender ===
Madí has a two-way gender system, distinguishing between masculine and feminine. All nouns carry gender, but not overtly; instead, the gender of a noun is shown by its verbal agreement, specifically in affixes. Affixes which mark for gender generally do so by a vowel alternation: for masculine, for feminine. For example, the declarative suffix &quot;-kV&quot; surfaces as when the verb it applies to references a masculine subject, but as when feminine.

The default, unmarked gender is feminine, and all subject pronouns (regardless of the sex of their referent) require feminine gender agreement.

=== Verbs ===
As mentioned above, the verb is by far the most morphologically complex part of speech in Madí. However, the precise delineation of a &quot;single verb&quot; is difficult, since certain grammatically bound inflections can nonetheless form independent phonological words. For example, the masculine declarative suffix is phonologically bound to the verb root in the word &quot;he is coming&quot;, but part of a phonologically independent word in the sentence &quot;I drink (something) with it&quot;. For this reason, Dixon prefers to analyse Madí in terms of &quot;predicates&quot; and &quot;copulas&quot; - sentence-level grammatical units which includes the verb root, personal pronouns in any position, and inflectional affixes, but excludes noun phrases.

This section discusses the notable features of Madí verbal morphology.

==== Prefixes ====
In contrast to suffixation, prefixation is relatively limited. There are only three prefix slots (relative positions which can only be occupied by a single member of the corresponding set), and only six unique prefixes in total. All of these are, however, extremely common:

The use and meaning of the applicative prefix are somewhat complex, and vary from verb to verb. For some intransitive verbs the applicative, in its prototypical linguistic function, adds a degree of valency and turns a peripheral argument into a core object (O); for example, the sentence &quot;the dog (S) barks at me (periph.)&quot; becomes &quot;the dog (S) barks-at me (O)&quot;. However, there are many instances in which the applicative does not necessarily perform this syntactic role, and instead signals some semantic function (e.g. when the subject S is a sick person or a full container).

==== Verb roots ====
The verb root is a single invariant morpheme to which inflection is applied. All verb roots are obligatory and cannot be deleted, with the single exception of the verb &quot;to say, ask&quot;, whose root is omitted if its auxiliary is prefixed with a pronoun or ; it surfaces therefore as merely the auxiliary .

Because of the variety and productivity of derivation in Madí, as well as the high degree of homophony resulting from sound change, there are somewhat fewer verb roots than would be expected in a more isolating language, and a single Madí verb root can correspond to several in English. The root , for example, can be translated as &quot;be hanging&quot;, &quot;lie (in a hammock)&quot;, &quot;live (in a place)&quot;, &quot;be located&quot;, or &quot;stay&quot;. Such ambiguity is resolved through inflection and pragmatic context.

==== Suffixes ====
The vast majority of verbal inflection in Madí takes place through suffixation. Because of the variety and complexity of suffixes as a whole, this section will describe them in specific categories.

===== Auxiliary roots and secondary verbs =====
Certain verb roots in Madí cannot themselves take inflection, but require the auxiliary to do so. The semantic distinction between the two is mostly opaque, but those taking seem to be vaguely associated with &quot;becoming&quot; - e.g. &quot;to be(come) sweaty&quot;. While is deleted under several conditions (mostly the addition of certain suffixes), is not except when preceded by the causative prefix (see above). The auxiliary must always be preceded by the prefix &quot;away&quot;, except when another Slot 1 prefix takes its place.

Occasionally, the absence of an auxiliary may occur on semantic criteria. Dixon records the sentence &quot;she is carrying her son on her back&quot; (with declarative marker ). The root , &quot;to carry on one&#x27;s back&quot;, is usually non-inflecting, and so a sentence containing an auxiliary might be expected. However, the sentence in question was made in reference to a photograph, indicating a semantic rule that an ordinarily non-inflecting verb can take inflection without an auxiliary if it describes a statement of timeless fact, rather than an ongoing event.

Despite being grammatically bound to the root verb, these auxiliary roots form a new phonological word, taking with them all suffixes following. For example, the inflected form above is a single phonological word, but Dixon&#x27;s expected form with an auxiliary - - is two.

There are two &quot;secondary verbs&quot; in Madí: &quot;continuous(ly)&quot; and &quot;(it) seems&quot;. Like auxiliary roots, these form a new phonological word, but are optional. These take place after the auxiliary root, &quot;miscellaneous suffixes&quot; (the slot comprising the majority of suffixes), and tense-modal suffixes, as well as third-position pronouns, but before mood and post-mood suffixes.

===== Tense-modal suffixes =====
These suffixes mark the tense of the verb, evidentiality, and modality. There is only a single degree of future tense, but three degrees of past: immediate, recent, and far past. The past tense forms are also fused with evidentiality (eyewitness vs. non-eyewitness), for a total of six past suffixes. The other suffixes in this category mark intentional, irrealis, hypothetical and reported (&quot;it is said&quot;...) modality respectively.

Tense-modal suffixes share a single slot relative to the verb root, but are not necessarily exclusive; for example, the past non-eyewitness suffixes are very often followed by the reported modal suffix.

===== Mood and post-mood =====
Towards the end of the predicate are attached suffixes conveying grammatical mood. These are indicative (divided into declarative and &quot;backgrounding&quot;; both optional), imperative (marked for proximity and positive vs. negative, for a total of four), interrogative (content, polar, and polar-future), as well as several single suffixes relating to a narrative (e.g. a climactic sentence).

These can only be followed within the predicate by &quot;post-mood&quot; suffixes - namely, the negative or a recapitulated tense form.

===== Other suffixes =====
The majority of Madí suffixes, however, are inserted into a slot after the verb root (or auxiliary root, if there is one) and before the tense-modal suffixes. Dixon characterizes members of this slot as &quot;miscellaneous suffixes&quot;, a group consisting of at least fifty-six distinct suffixes, all of these are strictly optional. Examples include &quot;also&quot;, &quot;for a short time&quot;, and &quot;unusual, unexpected&quot;. In general, these suffixes can combine with one another freely, although multiple subgroups exist whose members appear to be mutually exclusive.

==== Copula ====
The copula has a much more limited range of inflection than predicative verbs. The only suffixes which can follow it are negative , declarative backgrounding , and interrogatives . If the subject of the copula is a prefixed first- or second-person singular , moreover, this will attach to the negative rather than the verb itself: &quot;is it not you?&quot;

Unlike in English, a copula in Madí can be formed without a complement. Such sentences can be translated as either &quot;it is&quot; or &quot;there is, exists&quot;; for example, &quot;it is cold&quot; ( &quot;cold is&quot;) but &quot;there is a sore&quot; (or indeed, &quot;it is a sore&quot;). In general, the copula &quot;to be&quot; can be omitted without a suffix - e.g. &quot;you are going to be a chief now&quot;, &quot;chief you now&quot; - but this is rare.

Like many languages, Madí lacks a verb corresponding to &quot;to have&quot;. Instead, the possessed noun is used within a copula: &quot;I have some rubber&quot; ( &quot;my rubber is&quot;.)

=== Nouns ===
Nominal morphology is very simple. The only affix which can apply to a noun is the accusative suffix , which is essentially extinct in Jarawara (although still common in Jamamadí and Banawá); a remnant of this can be seen, however, in the non-singular object pronouns .

There is also a grammatically bound but phonologically independent marker , which signifies contrast with a previous noun (not X &quot;but Y&quot;). This inflection follows the noun, but precedes the accusative in Jamamadí and Banawá.

==== Possession ====
Madí contrasts alienable and inalienable possession: kinship terms (&quot;my father&quot;) and parts of a whole (&quot;my arm&quot;) are considered inalienably possessed, whereas other possessions are alienable. Most inalienable possession is marked simply by sequence, with the possessed following the possessor. An alienably possessed noun, on the other hand, must be preceded with : &quot;Okomobi&#x27;s canoe&quot;.

=== Pronouns ===
Madí has a rich inventory of personal pronouns. All personal pronouns mark for number; the first person plural also marks (as in many Amazonian languages) for clusivity. Unlike Indo-European languages such as English, Madí pronouns do not mark for case (e.g. &quot;I&quot; vs. &quot;me&quot;), but instead for the pronouns&#x27; position in relation to the verb (which itself signals the grammatical argument). The table below lists the pronominal forms cited by Dixon:

<text>Infidelity (synonyms include non-consensual non-monogamy, cheating, straying, adultery, being unfaithful, two-timing, or having an affair) is a violation of a couple&#x27;s emotional or sexual exclusivity that commonly results in feelings of anger, sexual jealousy, and rivalry.

What constitutes infidelity depends on expectations within the relationship. In marital relationships, exclusivity is commonly assumed. Infidelity can cause psychological damage, including feelings of rage and betrayal, depression, low sexual and personal confidence, and even post-traumatic stress disorder. People of both sexes can experience social consequences if their act of infidelity becomes public, but the form and extent of these consequences can depend on the gender of the unfaithful person.

==Incidence==
After the Kinsey Reports came out in the early 1950s, findings suggested that historically and cross-culturally, extramarital sex has been a matter of regulation more than sex before marriage. The Kinsey Reports found that around half of men and a quarter of women studied had committed adultery. The &quot;Janus Report on Sexual Behavior in America&quot; also reported that one-third of married men and a quarter of women have had an extramarital affair.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the most consistent data on infidelity comes from the University of Chicago&#x27;s General Social Survey (GSS). Interviews with people in monogamous relationships since 1972 by the GSS have shown that approximately 12% of men and 7% of women admit to having had an extramarital relationship. Results, however, vary year by year, and also by age-group surveyed. For example, one study conducted by the University of Washington, Seattle, found slightly, or significantly higher, rates of infidelity for populations under 35, or older than 60. In that study, which involved 19,065 people during a 15-year period, rates of infidelity among men were found to have risen from 20% to 28%, and rates for women ranged from 5% to 15%. In more recent nationwide surveys, several researchers found that about twice as many men as women reported having an extramarital affair. A survey conducted in 1990 found that 2.2% of married participants reported having more than one partner during the past year. In general, national surveys conducted in the early 1990s reported that between 15 and 25% of married Americans reported having extramarital affairs. People who had stronger sexual interests, more permissive sexual values, lower subjective satisfaction with their partner, weaker network ties to their partner, and greater sexual opportunities were more likely to be unfaithful. Studies suggest around 30–40% of unmarried relationships and 18–20% of marriages see at least one incident of sexual infidelity.

Rates of infidelity among women are thought to increase with age. In one study, rates were higher in more recent marriages, compared with previous generations. Men were found to be only &quot;somewhat&quot; more likely than women to engage in infidelity, with rates for both sexes becoming increasingly similar. Another study found that the likelihood of women being involved in infidelity reached a peak in the seventh year of their marriage and then declined afterward. For married men, the longer they were in relationships, the less likely they were to engage in infidelity, until the eighteenth year of marriage, at which point the chance of men engaging in infidelity began to increase.

Research on pregnancy and its effects on sexual desire and rates of infidelity conducted in southern Spain indicated that men were more likely to engage in infidelity while their partner was pregnant. It was estimated that 1 in 10 fathers-to-be engaged in infidelity at some point during their partner&#x27;s pregnancy and suggested that the likelihood of the man engaging in infidelity increases as the woman&#x27;s pregnancy progresses through its trimesters.

One measure of infidelity is paternal discrepancy, a situation that arises when someone who is presumed to be a child&#x27;s father is in fact not the biological parent. Frequencies as high as 30% are sometimes assumed in the media, but research by sociologist Michael Gilding traced these overestimates back to an informal remark at a 1972 conference. The detection of paternal discrepancy can occur in the context of medical genetic screening, in genetic family name research, and in immigration testing. Such studies show that paternal discrepancy is, in fact, less than 10% among the sampled African populations, less than 5% among the sampled Native American and Polynesian populations, less than 2% of the sampled Middle Eastern population, and generally 1–2% among European samples.

===Gender===
Differences in sexual infidelity as a function of gender have been commonly reported. In a recent study by Nicole A. Wedberg, conducted in 2016, has shown that over 50% of women in relationships have a backup partner.
However, the National Health and Social Life Survey found that 4% of married men, 16% of cohabiting men, and 37% of dating men engaged in acts of sexual infidelity in the previous year compared to 1% of married women, 8% of cohabiting women, and 17% of women in dating relationships. These differences have been generally thought due to evolutionary pressures that motivate men towards sexual opportunity and women towards commitment to one partner (for reasons such as reproductive success, stability, and social expectations). In addition, recent research finds that differences in gender may possibly be explained by other mechanisms including power and sensations seeking. For example, one study found that some women in more financially independent and higher positions of power, were also more likely to be more unfaithful to their partners. In another study, when the tendency to sensation seek (i.e., engage in risky behaviours) was controlled for, there were no gender differences in the likelihood to being unfaithful. These findings suggest there may be various factors that might influence the likelihood of some individuals to engage in extradyadic relationships, and that such factors may account for observed gender differences beyond actual gender and evolutionary pressures associated with each.

====Gender differences====
There is currently debate in the field of evolutionary psychology whether an innate, evolved sex difference exists between men and women in response to an act of infidelity; this is often called a &quot;sex difference&quot;. A study published in 2002 suggested there may be sex differences in jealousy. Those that posit a sex difference exists state that men are 60% more likely to be disturbed by an act of sexual infidelity (having one&#x27;s partner engage in sexual relations with another), whereas women are 83% more likely to be disturbed by an act of emotional infidelity (having one&#x27;s partner fall in love with another). Those against this model argue that there is no difference between men and women in their response to an act of infidelity. From an evolutionary perspective, men are theorized to maximize their fitness by investing as little as possible in their offspring and producing as many offspring as possible, due to the risk of males investing in children that are not theirs. Women, who do not face the risk of cuckoldry, are theorized to maximize their fitness by investing as much as possible in their offspring because they invest at least nine months of resources towards their offspring in pregnancy. Maximizing female fitness is theorized to require males in the relationship to invest all their resources in the offspring. These conflicting strategies are theorized to have resulted in selection of different jealousy mechanisms that are designed to enhance the fitness of the respective gender.

A common way to test whether an innate jealousy response exists between sexes is to use a forced-choice questionnaire. This style of questionnaire asks participants &quot;yes or no&quot; and &quot;response A or response B&quot; style questions about certain scenarios. For example, a question might ask, &quot;If you found your partner cheating on you would you be more upset by (A) the sexual involvement or (B) the emotional involvement&quot;. Many studies using forced choice questionnaires have found statistically significant results supporting an innate sex difference between men and women. Furthermore, studies have shown that this observation holds across many cultures, although the magnitudes of the sex difference vary within sexes across cultures.

Although forced-choice questionnaires show a statistically significant sex-difference, critics of the theory of evolved sex differences in jealousy question these findings. In consideration of the entire body of work on sex differences, C. F. Harris asserted that when methods other than forced-choice questionnaires are used to identify an innate sex difference, inconsistencies between studies begin to arise. For example, researchers found that women sometimes report feeling more intense jealousy in response to both sexual and emotional infidelity. The results of these studies also depended on the context in which the participants were made to describe what type of jealousy they felt, as well as the intensity of their jealousy.

In her meta-analysis, Harris raises the question of whether forced choice questionnaires actually measure what they purport: jealousy itself and evidence that differences in jealousy arise from innate mechanisms. Her meta-analysis reveals that sex-differences are almost exclusively found in forced-choice studies. According to Harris, a meta-analysis of multiple types of studies should indicate a convergence of evidence and multiple operationalizations. This is not the case, which raises the question as to the validity of forced-choice studies. DeSteno and Bartlett (2002) further support this argument by providing evidence which indicates that significant results of forced-choice studies may actually be an artifact of measurement; this finding would invalidate many of the claims made by those &quot;in favor&quot; of an &quot;innate&quot; sex difference. Even those &quot;in favor&quot; of sex-differences admit that certain lines of research, such as homicide studies, suggest against the possibility of sex-differences.

These inconsistent results have led researchers to propose novel theories that attempt to explain the sex differences observed in certain studies. One theory that has been hypothesized to explain why men and women both report more distress to emotional infidelity than sexual infidelity is borrowed from childhood attachment theories. Studies have found that attachment styles of adults are consistent with their self-reported relationship histories. For example, more men are reported to have an insecure, dismissing avoidant attachment style; where these &quot;individuals often attempt to minimize or constrict emotional experience, deny needs for intimacy, are highly invested in autonomy, and are more sexually promiscuous than individuals who have other attachment styles&quot;. Levy and Kelly (2010) tested this theory and found that adult attachment styles strongly correlate to which type of infidelity elicited more jealousy. Individuals who have secure attachment styles often report that emotional infidelity is more upsetting whereas dismissing attachment styles were more likely to find sexual infidelity more upsetting. Their study did report that men in general were more likely than women to report sexual infidelity as more distressing, however this could be related to more men having a dismissing attachment style. The authors propose that a social mechanism may be responsible for the observed results. In other words, replicable sex differences in emotion and sexual jealousy could be a function of a social function. Similar studies focusing on the masculinization and feminization by society also argue for a social explanation, while discounting an evolutionary explanation.

A 2015 study found a correlation between AVPR1A expression and predisposition to extrapair mating in women but not in men.

===Sexual orientation===
Evolutionary researchers have suggested that men and women have innate mechanisms that contribute to why they become sexually jealous, this is especially true for certain types of infidelity. It has been hypothesized that heterosexual men have developed an innate psychological mechanism that responds to the threat of sexual infidelity more than emotional infidelity, and vice versa for heterosexual women because potential cuckoldry is more detrimental to the male, who could potentially invest in offspring of another male, while for females emotional infidelity is more worrisome because they could lose the parental investment to another woman&#x27;s offspring, therefore affecting their chances of survival. However, more recent studies suggest that increasingly both men and women would find emotional infidelity psychologically worse.

Symons (1979) determined that sexual jealousy is the major reason that many homosexual men are unsuccessful in maintaining monogamous relationships and suggests that all men are innately disposed to want sexual variation, with the difference between heterosexual and homosexual men being that homosexual men can find willing partners more often for casual sex, and thus satisfy this innate desire for sexual variety. However, according to this view, all men can be &quot;hard wired&quot; to be sexually jealous, and therefore gay men could be more upset by sexual infidelity than by emotional infidelity, and that lesbians could be more upset by emotional infidelity than sexual. Recent studies suggest that it may not be an innate mechanism, rather depends on the importance placed on sexual exclusivity. Peplau and Cochran (1983) found that sexual exclusivity was much more important to heterosexual men and women compared to homosexual men and women. This theory suggests that it is not sexuality that may lead to differences but that people are prone to jealousy in domains that are especially important to them. Barah and Lipton argue that heterosexual couples may cheat just as much as homosexual relationships.

Harris (2002) tested these hypotheses among 210 individuals: 48 homosexual women, 50 homosexual men, 40 heterosexual women, and 49 heterosexual men. Results found that more heterosexual than homosexual individuals picked sexual infidelity as worse than emotional infidelity, with heterosexual men being the highest, and that when forced to choose, gay men overwhelmingly predicted emotional infidelity would be more troubling than sexual infidelity. These findings contradict Symons (1979) suggestion that there would be no gender difference in predicted responses to infidelity by sexual orientation. Blow and Bartlett (2005) suggest that even though sex outside of a homosexual relationship might be seen as more acceptable in some relationships, the consequences of infidelity do not occur without pain or jealousy.

Heterosexuals rated emotional and sexual infidelity as more emotionally distressing than did lesbian and gay individuals. Sex and sexual orientation differences emerged regarding the degree to which specific emotions were reported in response to sexual and emotional infidelity. Few researchers have explored the influence of sexual orientation on which type of infidelity is viewed as more distressing.

Summarizing the findings from these studies, heterosexual men seem to be more distressed by sexual infidelity than heterosexual women, lesbian women, and gay men. These latter three groups seem more responsible for this difference by reporting similarly higher levels of distress toward emotional infidelity than heterosexual men. However, within-sex analyses reveal that heterosexual men tend to rate emotional infidelity as more distressing than sexual infidelity.

==Responses==
Some studies suggest that only a small percentage of couples that experience infidelity actually improve their relationship, whereas others report couples having surprisingly positive relationship outcomes. In terms of negative responses to infidelity, Charney and Parnass (1995) report that after hearing of a partner&#x27;s infidelity, reactions have included rage and increased aggressiveness, loss of trust, decreased personal and sexual confidence, sadness, depression, damaged self-esteem, fear of abandonment, and a surge of justification to leave their partner. Another study reported that nearly 60% of the partners that were cheated on had emotional problems and depression following disclosure of the affair. Other negative consequences have included damage to relationships with children, parents, and friends, as well as legal consequences. A report in 1983 detailed that of a sample of 205 divorced individuals, about one half said their marital problems were caused by their spouse&#x27;s infidelity.

The negative impact of infidelity on a relationship depends on how involved partners are in their infidelity relationship, and researchers maintain that infidelity itself does not cause divorce but the overall level of relationship satisfaction, motives for infidelity, level of conflict, and attitudes held about infidelity do. In fact, Schneider, et al. (1999) reported that even though 60% of their participants initially threatened to leave their primary relationship, a threat to leave due to infidelity did not actually predict the eventual outcome. Atkins, Eldridge, Baucom, and Christiansen found that couples who went through therapy as well as openly dealt with the infidelity were able to change at a faster rate than distressed couples who were just in therapy. Some unintended positive outcomes that have been reported for couples experiencing infidelity include closer marital relationships, increased assertiveness, taking better care of oneself, placing higher value on family, and realizing the importance of marital communication.

If divorce results from infidelity, research suggest that the &quot;faithful&quot; spouse may experience feelings of low life satisfaction and self-esteem; they may also engage in future relationships fearful of the same incidence occurring. Sweeney and Horwitz (2001) found that individuals who initiated a divorce after hearing about their partner&#x27;s infidelity experienced less depression; however, the opposite was true when the offending spouse initiated divorce.

According to attachment theory, intimates evaluate the availability of close others and respond to them accordingly. While those with a secure attachment style believe others are available to them, those with insecure attachment believe others are less available to them. People who develop high levels of attachment have more anxiety and uncertainty. They cope by seeking reassurance and clinging themselves to another person. In attachment theory, people seek sex to help meet their needs. Those whose partners are unfaithful may experience anxiety, stress and depression. They are more likely to engage in activities that are risky to their health. Women who experienced negative appraisals, like self-blame and causal attribution, led to emotional distress and increased health-compromising behavior.

Gender self-esteem greatly affects infidelity. Different factors for the two genders are known to influence jealousy. Heterosexual men seem to be more distressed by sexual infidelity than heterosexual women, lesbian women, and gay men. The latter three groups seem more responsible for the difference by reporting similarly higher levels of distress toward emotional infidelity than heterosexual men.

==Causes==
Studies have found that men are more likely to engage in extramarital sex if they are unsatisfied sexually, while women are more likely to engage in extramarital sex if they are unsatisfied emotionally. Kimmel and Van Der Veen found that sexual satisfaction may be more important to husbands and that wives are more concerned with compatibility with their partners. Studies suggest that individuals who can separate concepts of sex and love are more likely to accept situations where infidelity occurs. One study done by Roscoe, Cavanaugh, and Kennedy found that women indicated relationship dissatisfaction as the number one reason for infidelity, whereas men reported a lack of communication, understanding, and sexual incompatibility. Glass and Wright also found that men and women who are involved in both sexual and emotional infidelities reported being the most dissatisfied in their relationships than those who engaged in either sexual or emotional infidelity alone. In general, marital dissatisfaction overall is the number one reason often reported for infidelity for both sexes.
It is important to note that there are many other factors that increase the likelihood of anyone engaging in infidelity. Individuals exhibiting sexually permissive attitudes and those who have had a high number of past sexual relationships are also more likely to engage in infidelity. Other factors such as being well educated, living in an urban centre, being less religious, having a liberal ideology and values, having more opportunities to meet potential partners, and being older affected the likelihood of one being involved in an extramarital affair.

===Anthropological viewpoint===
Anthropologists tend to believe humans are neither completely monogamous nor completely polygamous. Anthropologist Bobbi Low says we are &quot;slightly polygamous&quot;, while Deborah Blum believes we are &quot;ambiguously monogamous&quot;, and slowly moving away from the polygamous habits of our evolutionary ancestors.

According to anthropologist Helen Fisher, there are numerous psychological reasons for adultery. Some people may want to supplement a marriage, solve a sex problem, gather more attention, seek revenge, or have more excitement in the marriage. But based on Fisher&#x27;s research, there also is a biological side to adultery. &quot;We have two brain systems: one of them is linked to attachment and romantic love, and then there is the other brain system, which is purely sex drive.&quot; Sometimes these two brain systems are not well-connected, which enables people to become adulterers and satisfy their libido without any regards to their attachment side.

===Cultural variation===
Often, gender differences in both jealousy and infidelity are attributable to cultural factors. This variation stems from the fact that societies differ in how they view extramarital affairs and jealousy. An examination of jealousy across seven nations revealed that each partner in a relationship serves as each other&#x27;s primary and exclusive source of satisfaction and attention in all cultures. Therefore, when an individual feels jealousy towards another, it is usually because they are now sharing their primary source of attention and satisfaction. However, variation can be seen when identifying the behaviors and actions that betray the role of primary attention (satisfaction) giver. For instance, in certain cultures if an individual goes out with another of the opposite gender, emotions of intense jealousy can result; however, in other cultures, this behavior is perfectly acceptable and is not given much thought.

It is important to understand where these cultural variations come from and how they root themselves into differing perceptions of infidelity. While many cultures report infidelity as wrong and admonish it, some are more tolerant of such behaviour. These views are generally linked to the overall liberal nature of the society. For instance, Danish society is viewed as more liberal than many other cultures, and as such, have correlating liberal views on infidelity and extramarital affairs. According to Christine Harris and Nicholas Christenfeld, societies that are legally more liberal against extramarital affairs judge less harshly upon sexual infidelity because it is distinct from emotional infidelity. In Danish society, having sex does not necessarily imply a deep emotional attachment. As a result, infidelity does not carry such a severe negative connotation. A comparison between modern-day Chinese and American societies showed that there was greater distress with sexual infidelity in the U.S. than in China. The cultural difference is most likely due to the more restrictive nature of Chinese society, thus, making infidelity a more salient concern. Sexual promiscuity is more prominent in the United States, thus it follows that American society is more preoccupied with infidelity than Chinese society. Often, a single predominant religion can influence the culture of an entire nation. Even within Christianity in the United States, there are discrepancies as to how extramarital affairs are viewed. For instance, Protestants and Catholics do not view infidelity with equal severity. The conception of marriage is also markedly different; while in Roman Catholicism marriage is seen as an indissoluble sacramental bond and does not permit divorce even in cases of infidelity, most Protestant denominations allow for divorce and remarriage for infidelity or other reasons. Ultimately, it was seen that adults that associated with a religion (any denomination) were found to view infidelity as much more distressing than those who were not affiliated with a religion. Those that participated more heavily in their religions were even more conservative in their views on infidelity.

Some research has also suggested that being African American has a positive correlation to infidelity, even when education attainment is controlled for. Other research suggests that lifetime incidence of infidelity does not differ between African Americans and whites, only the likelihood of when they engage in it. Race and gender have been found to be positively correlated with infidelity, however this is the case more often for African American men engaging in extramarital infidelity. Human mating strategies differ from culture to culture. For example, Schmitt discusses how tribal cultures with higher pathogen stress are more likely to have polygynous marriage systems; whereas monogamous mating systems usually have relatively lower high-pathogen environments. In addition researchers have also proposed the idea that high mortality rates in local cultures should be correlated with more permissive mating strategies. On the other hand, Schmitt discusses how demanding reproductive environments should increase the desire and pursuit of biparental, monogamous relationships.

===Strategic pluralism theory===
Strategic pluralism is a theory that focuses on how environmental factors influence mating strategies. According to this theory, when people live within environments that are demanding and stressful, the need for bi-parental care is greater for increasing the survival of offspring. Correspondingly, monogamy and commitment are more commonplace. On the other hand, when people live within environments that encompass little stress and threats to the viability of offspring, the need for serious and committed relations is lowered, and therefore promiscuity and infidelity are more common.

===Sex-ratio theory===
Sex ratio theory is a theory that explains the relationship and sexual dynamics within different areas of the world based on the ratio of the number of marriage-aged men to marriage-aged women. According to this theory, an area has a high sex ratio when there is a higher number of marriage-aged women to marriage-aged men and an area has a low sex ratio when there are more marriage-aged men. In terms of infidelity, the theory states that when sex ratios are high, men are more likely to be promiscuous and engage in sex outside of a committed relationship because the demand for men is higher and this type of behavior, desired by men, is more accepted. On the other hand, when sex ratios are low, promiscuity is less common because women are in demand and since they desire monogamy and commitment, in order for men to remain competitive in the pool of mates, they must respond to these desires. Support for this theory comes from evidence showing higher divorce rates in countries with higher sex ratios and higher monogamy rates in countries with lower sex ratios.

==Other contributing factors==
While infidelity is by no means exclusive to certain groups of people, its perception can be influenced by other factors. Furthermore, within a &quot;homogeneous culture&quot;, like that in the United States, factors like community size can be strong predictors of how infidelity is perceived. Larger communities tend to care less about infidelity whereas small towns are much more concerned with such issues. These patterns are observed in other cultures as well. For example, a cantina in a small, rural Mexican community is often viewed as a place where &quot;decent&quot; or &quot;married&quot; women do not go because of its semi-private nature. Conversely, public spaces like the market or plaza are acceptable areas for heterosexual interaction. A smaller population size presents the threat of being publicly recognized for infidelity. However, within a larger community of the same Mexican society, entering a bar or watering hole would garner a different view. It would be deemed perfectly acceptable for both married and unmarried individuals to drink at a bar in a large city. These observations can be paralleled to rural and urban societies in the United States as well. Ultimately, these variables and societal differences dictate attitudes towards sexual infidelity which can vary across cultures as well as within cultures.
&quot;Mate poaching&quot; is the phenomenon of a single person luring a person who is in an intimate relationship to leave their partner for the single person. According to a survey of 16,964 individuals in 53 countries by David Schmitt (2001), mate poaching happens significantly more frequently in Middle Eastern countries such as Turkey and Lebanon, and less frequently in East Asian countries such as China and Japan.

===Evolutionary factors===
The parental investment theory is used to explain evolutionary pressures that can account for sex differences in infidelity. This theory states that the sex that invests less in the offspring has more to gain from indiscriminate sexual behaviour. This means that women, who typically invest more time and energy into raising their offspring (9 months of carrying offspring, breast feeding etc.), should be more choosy when it comes to mate selection and should therefore desire long-term, monogamous relationships that would ensure the viability of their offspring. Men on the other hand, have less parental investment and so they are driven towards indiscriminate sexual activity with multiple partners as such activity increases the likelihood of their reproduction. This theory says that it is these evolutionary pressures that act on men and women differentially and what ultimately drives more men to seek sexual activity outside of their own relationships. It can however, still account for the occurrence of extradyadic sexual relationships among women. For example, a woman whose husband has fertilization difficulties can benefit from engaging in sexual activity outside of her relationship. She can gain access to high-quality genes and still derive the benefit of parental investment from her husband or partner who is unknowingly investing in their illegitimate child. Evidence for the development of such a short-term mating strategy in women comes from findings that women who engage in affairs typically do so with men who are of higher status, dominance, physical attractiveness (which is indicative of genetic quality).

===Defense mechanisms===
One defense mechanism that some researchers believe is effective at preventing infidelity is jealousy. Jealousy is an emotion that can elicit strong responses. Cases have been commonly documented where sexual jealousy was a direct cause of murders and morbid jealousy. Buss (2005) states that jealousy has three main functions to help prevent infidelity. These suggestions are:
* It can alert an individual to threats with a valued relationship.
* It can be activated by the presence of interested and more desirable intrasexual rivals.
* It can function as a motivational mechanism that creates behavioral outputs to deter infidelity and abandonment.
Looking at jealousy&#x27;s physiological mechanism offers support for this idea. Jealousy is a form of stress response which has been shown to activate the sympathetic nervous system by increasing heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration. This will activate the &quot;fight or flight&quot; response to ensure action against the attempt at sexual infidelity in their partner. Buss and his colleagues were the first to pioneer a theory that jealousy is an evolved human emotion that has become an innate module, hard-wired to prevent infidelity from occurring. This idea is commonly referred to as Jealousy as a Specific Innate Module and has become widely debated. The basis behind this argument is that jealousy was beneficial in our ancestor&#x27;s time when cuckoldry was more common. They suggested that those who were equipped with this emotional response could more effectively stop infidelity and those without the emotional response had a harder time doing so. Because infidelity imposed such a fitness cost, those who had the jealous emotional response, improved their fitness, and could pass down the jealousy module to the next generation.

Another defense mechanism for preventing infidelity is by social monitoring and acting on any violation of expectations. Researchers in favor of this defense mechanism speculate that in our ancestor&#x27;s times, the act of sex or emotional infidelity is what triggered jealousy and therefore the signal detection would have happened only after infidelity had occurred, making jealousy an emotional by-product with no selective function. In line with this reasoning, these researchers hypothesize that as a person monitors their partner&#x27;s actions with a potential rival through primary and secondary appraisals; if their expectations are violated at either level of observation, they will become distressed and enact an appropriate action to stop the chance of infidelity. Social monitoring therefore enables them to act accordingly before infidelity occurs, thereby having the capability to raise their fitness. Research testing this theory has found more favor for the sexual jealousy hypothesis.

A more recently suggested defense mechanism of infidelity attracting more attention is that a particular social group will punish cheaters by damaging their reputation. The basis for this suggestion stems from the fact that humans have an unmatched ability to monitor social relationships and inflict punishment on cheaters, regardless of the context. This punishment comes in many forms, one of which is gossip. This damage will impair the future benefits that individual can confer from the group and its individuals. A damaged reputation is especially debilitating when related to sexual and emotional infidelity, because it can limit future reproductive mate choices within the group and will cause a net fitness cost that outweighs the fitness benefit gained from the infidelity. Such limitations and costs deter an individual from cheating in the first place. Support for this defense mechanism comes from fieldwork by Hirsch and his colleagues (2007) that found that gossip about extramarital affairs in a small community in Mexico was particularly prevalent and devastating for reputation in this region. Specifically, adultery was found to cause an individual to be disowned by their family, decrease the marriage value of his/her family, cause an individual to lose money or a job, and diminish future reproductive potential. In this community, men having extramarital affairs did so in private areas with lower prevalence of women connected to the community, such as bars and brothels, both areas of which had a high risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections.

==The Internet==
The proliferation of sex chat rooms and dating apps has increased the opportunity for people in committed relationships to engage in acts of infidelity on and off the Internet. A cyber affair is defined as &quot;a romantic or sexual relationship initiated by online contact and maintained primarily via online communication&quot;. Sexual acts online include behaviors such as cybersex, where two or more individuals engage in discussions about sexual fantasies over the Internet and is usually accompanied by masturbation; hot-chatting, where discussions between two or more people move away from light-hearted flirting; and emotional acts where people disclose intimate information to a significant other. A new type of sexual activity online is when two people&#x27;s avatars engage in sexual activity in virtual reality worlds such as &quot;Second Life&quot;. The majority of Americans believe that if a partner engaged in cybersex this constitutes as an act of infidelity.

A 2005 survey of 1828 participants reported one third of them reported engaging in cybersex and of that one third, 46% said they were in a committed relationship with someone else.

In an attempt to differentiate offline and online infidelity, Cooper, Morahan-Martin, Mathy, and Maheu constructed a &quot;Triple-A Engine&quot;, which identifies the three aspects of Internet infidelity that distinguish it, to some degree, from traditional infidelity:

* Accessibility: the more access one has to the Internet, the more likely they will engage in infidelity
* Affordability: the monetary cost of being able to access the Internet continues to drop, and for a small price, a user can visit many sites, and meet multiple potential sexual needs
* Anonymity: the Internet allows users to masquerade as someone else, or hide their identity altogether.

In a study of 335 Dutch undergraduate students involved in serious intimate relationships, participants were presented with four dilemmas concerning a partner&#x27;s emotional and sexual infidelity over the Internet. They found a significant sex difference as to whether participants chose sexual and emotional infidelity as more upsetting. More men than women indicated that a partner&#x27;s sexual involvement would upset them more than a partner&#x27;s emotional bonding with someone else. Similarly, in the dilemma involving infidelity over the Internet, more men indicated their partner&#x27;s sexual involvement would upset them more than a partner&#x27;s emotional bonding with someone else. Women, on the other hand, expressed more problems with emotional infidelity over the Internet than did men.

Online infidelity can be just as damaging to a relationship as offline physical unfaithfulness. A possible explanation is that our brain registers virtual and physical acts the same way and responds similarly. Several studies have concluded that online infidelity, whether sexual or emotional in nature, often leads to off-line infidelity.

===Chat rooms===
A study by Beatriz Lia Avila Mileham in 2004 examined the phenomenon of online infidelity in chat rooms. The following factors were investigated: what elements and dynamics online infidelity involves and how it happens; what leads individuals specifically to the computer to search for a relationship &quot;on the side&quot;; whether individuals consider online contacts as infidelity and why or why not; and what dynamics chat room users experience in their marriages. The results led to three constructs that symbolize chat room dynamics and serve as a foundation for Internet infidelity:
* Anonymous sexual interactionism: the individuals&#x27; predilection for anonymous interactions of a sexual nature in chat rooms. The allure of anonymity gains extra importance for married individuals, who can enjoy relative safety to express fantasies and desires without being known or exposed.
* Behavioral rationalization: the reasoning that chat room users present for conceiving their online behaviors as innocent and harmless, despite the secrecy and highly sexual nature.
* Effortless avoidance: chat room users&#x27; lack of psychological discomfort in exchanging sexual messages with strangers.

==Legal implications==

All countries in Europe, as well as most countries in Latin America have decriminalized adultery; however, in many countries in Africa and Asia (particularly the Middle East) this type of infidelity is criminalized. Even where infidelity is not a criminal offense, it may have legal implications in divorce cases; for example it may be a factor in property settlement, the custody of children, the denial of alimony, etc. In civil claims, not only the spouse, but also the &quot;other man/other woman&quot; may be held accountable: for example, seven US states (Hawaii, Illinois, North Carolina, Mississippi, New Mexico, South Dakota, and Utah) allow the possibility of the tort action of alienation of affections (brought by a deserted spouse against a third party alleged to be responsible for the failure of the marriage). In a highly publicized case in 2010, a woman in North Carolina won a $9 million suit against her husband&#x27;s mistress. In the United States, criminal laws relating to infidelity vary, and those states that criminalize adultery rarely prosecute the offense. Penalties for adultery range from life imprisonment in Michigan, to a $10 fine in Maryland or class 1 felony in Wisconsin. The constitutionality of US criminal laws on adultery is unclear due to Supreme Court decisions in 1965 giving privacy of sexual intimacy to consenting adults, as well as broader implications of &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot; (2003). Adultery is declared to be illegal in 21 states.

In many jurisdictions, adultery may have indirect legal implications, particularly in cases of infliction of violence, such as domestic assaults and killings, in particular by mitigating murder to manslaughter, or otherwise providing for partial or complete defenses in case of violence, especially in cultures where there is a traditional toleration of crimes of passion and honor killings. Such provisions have been condemned by the Council of Europe and the United Nations in recent years. The Council of Europe Recommendation Rec(2002)5 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection of women against violence states that member states should: &quot;(...) 57. preclude adultery as an excuse for violence within the family.&quot; UN Women has also stated in regard to the defense of provocation and other similar defenses: &quot;Laws should clearly state that these defenses do not include or apply to crimes of &#x27;honour&#x27;, adultery, or domestic assault or murder.&quot;

==Workplace issues==
As the number of women in the workforce increases to match that of men, researchers expect the likelihood of infidelity will also increase with workplace interactions. Wiggins and Lederer (1984) found that opportunities to engage in infidelity were related to the workplace where nearly one half of their samples who engaged in infidelity were involved with coworkers. A study done by McKinnish (2007) found that those who work with a larger fraction of workers of the opposite sex are more likely to be divorced due to infidelity. Kuroki found that married women were less likely to have a workplace affair, whereas self-employed individuals are more likely. In 2000, Treas and Giesen found similar results where sexual opportunities in the workplace increased the likelihood of infidelity during the last 12 months.

Adulterous office romances are widely considered to be unhelpful to business and work relationships, and superior-subordinate relationships are banned in 90% of companies with written policies regarding office romance. Companies cannot ban adultery, as, in all but a handful of states, such regulations would run afoul of laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of marital status. Firings nonetheless often occur on the basis of charges of inappropriate office conduct.

Academics and therapists say cheating is probably more prevalent on the road than close to home. The protection of the road offers a secret life of romance, far from spouses or partners. Affairs range from one-night stands to relationships that last for years. They are usually with a co-worker, a business associate or someone they repeatedly encounter.

Another reason for the development of office romances is the amount of time co-workers spend together. Spouses today often spend more time with co-workers in the office than with each other. A &quot;Newsweek&quot; article notes, &quot;Nearly 60 percent of American women work outside the home, up from about 40 percent in 1964. Quite simply, women intersect with more people during the day than they used to. They go to more meetings, take more business trips and, presumably, participate more in flirtatious water-cooler chatter.&quot;

According to Debra Laino in an article for &quot;Shave&quot;, some of the reasons women cheat at the workplace are because &quot;women are disproportionately exposed to men in the workplace, and, as a direct consequence, many have more options and chances to cheat.&quot;

==Alternative views (swinging and polyamory)==
Swinging is a form of extradyadic sex where married couples exchange partners with each other. Swinging was originally called &quot;wife-swapping&quot;, but due to the sexist connotations and the fact that many wives were willing to swap partners, &quot;mate swapping&quot; and or &quot;swinging&quot; was substituted. The Supreme Court of Canada has ruled swinging is legal as long as it takes place in a private place and is consensual. Swinging can be closed or open, where couples meet and each pair goes off to a separate room or they have sex in the same room. The majority of swingers fall into the middle and upper classes, with an above average education and income, and majority of these swingers are white (90%). A study done by Jenks in 1986 found that swingers are not significantly different from non-swingers on measures such as philosophy, authoritarianism, self-respect, happiness, freedom, equality etc. Swingers tend to emphasize personal values over more social ones. According to Henshel (1973), the initiation into the world of swinging usually is done by the husband.

Reasons for getting involved in swinging are the variety of sexual partners and experiences, pleasure or excitement, meeting new people, and voyeurism. In order for swinging to work, both partners need to have a liberal sexual predisposition, and a low degree of jealousy. Gilmartin (1975) found that 85% of his sample of swingers felt that these sexual encounters posed no real threat to their marriage and felt it had improved. Jenks (1998) found no reason to believe that swinging was detrimental to marriage, with over 91% of males and 82% of females indicating they were happy with swinging.
Another form of extradyadic sex is polyamory, a &quot;non-possessive, honest, responsible and ethical philosophy and practice of loving multiple people simultaneously&quot;. There are various types of relationships in polyamory such as intentional family, group relationship, and group marriage. One type of group relationship can be a triad involving a married couple and an additional person who all share sexual intimacy, however, it is usually an addition of a female. Unlike polygyny or polyandry, both men and women may have multiple partners within the confines of polyamory. Polyamorous relationships are distinguished from extramarital affairs by the full disclosure and consent of all involved. Polyamorous relationships may specify unique boundaries outside monogamous expectations of fidelity, that if violated are still considered cheating. Because both men and women can have multiple partners, these individuals do not consider themselves to be either uncommitted or unfaithful.

<text>Charles Burney FRS (born Lynn Regis, now King&#x27;s Lynn, Norfolk, 4 December 1757, died at Deptford, then in Kent, 28 December 1817) was an English classical scholar, schoolmaster, clergyman and chaplain to George III. He kept a school for boys in Hammersmith and later Greenwich.

==Family and education==

A native of London, he was the son of Charles Burney, a music historian, and his first wife, Esther Sleepe. He was a brother of the novelist and diarist Fanny Burney and the explorer James Burney, and a half-brother of the novelist Sarah Burney.

Burney was educated at Charterhouse School, London and at Gonville and Caius College, University of Cambridge. He was accused of stealing books from the university library to pay debts and sent down in 1778. He obtained an LLD degree from King&#x27;s College, Aberdeen in 1781. Burney collected 13,000 rare books and manuscripts, which he sold to the British Museum in 1817 for £13,500. This Burney Collection is housed in the British Library.

==Usher, scholar and parson==

In 1782, Burney became a master at a private school in Chiswick run by William Rose. He married Rose&#x27;s daughter Sarah (1759–1821) in 1783. When Rose died in 1786, Burney took over the school, moving it to nearby Hammersmith and then to Greenwich in 1793.

Many eminent naval and military officers were educated there, but he seems to have been such a disciplinarian that he provoked a rebellion of about 50 boys at some time in the early years of the 19th century. One boy described it in an undated letter to his mother. The boys took food, chessboards, cards and weapons, and barricaded themselves in: &quot;Then Burney came and told them to open the door but they said it was not shut to be opened. He then got a ladder &amp; got at the top of the door where he could see them all... till at last as the door was going to be cut open they unfastened it, when Burney rushed in. At first they hit him with their sticks but he knocked them about till at last they were quiet &amp; Burney very generously gave them the choice of being expelled or forgiven; above 40 were forgiven and 2 expelled.&quot;

Burney transferred the school to his only child Charles Parr Burney (Archdeacon of Colchester) (1785–1864), who ran it from 1813 to 1833.

Burney gained a strong reputation as a Greek scholar with several publications. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1802. He made his peace with Cambridge University, which awarded him an MA in 1808 on his ordination as an Anglican priest. He advanced rapidly in the Church of England, becoming rector of the rich living of Cliffe, Kent, and of St Paul&#x27;s, Deptford. He also served as a royal chaplain and as a prebendary of Lincoln Cathedral. He died of apoplexy, aged sixty.

==Memorials==
There are memorials to Burney in Westminster Abbey, by Sebastian Gahagan, and St Paul&#x27;s, Deptford, by Lewis Alexander Goblet.

<text>Anne Catherine Emmerich, CRV (also &quot;Anna Katharina Emmerick&quot;; 8 September 1774 – 9 February 1824) was a Roman Catholic
Augustinian canoness of the Congregation of Windesheim. During her lifetime, she was a purported mystic, Marian visionary and stigmatist.

Emmerich was born in Flamschen, an impoverished farming community at Coesfeld, in the Diocese of Münster, Westphalia, Germany, and died in Dülmen (aged 49), where she had been a bedridden nun. Emmerich purportedly experienced visions on the life and Passion of Jesus Christ as revealed to her by the Blessed Virgin Mary under religious ecstasy.

During her bedridden years, a number of well-known figures were inspired to visit her. The poet Clemens Maria Brentano interviewed her at length and wrote several pages based on his notes of her visions. The authenticity of Brentano&#x27;s writings has been questioned and critics have characterized the books as &quot;conscious elaborations by a poet&quot;.

Pope John Paul II beatified Emmerich on 3 October 2004, highlighting her personal virtues and Catholic piety. The purported “House of the Virgin Mary” in Ephesus is piously associated to her name. 

==Early life==

Emmerich was born into a family of poor farmers and had nine brothers and sisters. The family&#x27;s surname was derived from an ancestral town. From an early age, she helped with the house and farm work. Her schooling was rather brief, but all those who knew her noticed that she felt drawn to prayer from an early age. At twelve, she started to work at a large farm in the vicinity for three years and later learned to be a seamstress and worked as such for several years.

She applied for admission to various convents, but she was rejected because she could not afford a bridal dowry. Eventually, the Order of Saint Clare in Münster agreed to accept her, provided she would learn to play the musical organ. She went to the organist Söntgen in Coesfeld to study music and learn to play the organ, but the poverty of the Söntgen family prompted her to work there and to sacrifice her small savings in an effort to help them. Later, one of the Söntgen daughters entered the convent with her.

==Religious life==
In 1802, Emmerich (aged 28) and her friend Klara Söntgen finally managed to join the Augustinian nuns at the convent of Agnetenberg in Dülmen. The following year, Emmerich took her religious vows. In the convent, she became known for her strict observance of the order&#x27;s rule; but, from the beginning to 1811, she was often quite ill and had to endure great pain. At times, her zeal and strict adherence to rules disturbed some of the more tepid sisters, who were puzzled by her weak health and religious ecstasies.

When the King of Westphalia, Jérôme Bonaparte suppressed the convent in 1812, she sought and found refuge in the house of a widow.

==Stigmata==

In early 1813, marks of the stigmata were reported on Emmerich&#x27;s body. The parish priest called in two doctors to examine her. When word of the phenomenon spread three months later, he notified the vicar general. With the news causing considerable talk in the town, the ecclesiastical authorities conducted a lengthy investigation. Many doctors wished to examine the case, and although efforts were made to discourage the curious, there were visitors whose rank or status gained them entry. During this time, the poet and romanticist Clemens Brentano first visited.

At the end of 1818, the periodic bleeding of Emmerich&#x27;s hands and feet had stopped and the wounds had closed. While many in the community viewed the stigmata as real, others considered Emmerich an impostor conspiring with her associates to perpetrate a fraud. In August 1819, the civil authorities intervened and moved Emmerich to a different house, where she was kept under observation for three weeks. The members of the commission could find no evidence of fraud and were divided in their opinions.

As the cross on her breastbone had the unusual shape of a &quot;Y&quot;, similar to a cross in the local church of Coesfeld, English priest Herbert Thurston surmised that &quot;the subjective impressions of the stigmatic exercise a preponderating influence upon the manifestations which appear exteriorly,&quot; the same pathway to stigmata described in the works of the Augustinian Catholic priest, John of Ruusbroec.

==Purported apparitions==

As a young child, Emmerich claimed she had visions in which she talked with Jesus and saw the Souls in Purgatory. She further described the core of the Holy Trinity in the form of three concentric, interpenetrating full spheres. The largest but dimmest of the spheres represented the Father core, the medium sphere the Son core, and the smallest and brightest sphere the Holy Spirit core. Each sphere of omnipresent God is extended toward infinity beyond God&#x27;s core placed in heaven. The Brentano compilation tells that during an illness in Emmerich&#x27;s childhood, she was visited by the Child Jesus who told her of plants she should ingest in order to heal, including Morning Glory flower juice, known to contain ergine.

Based on Emmerich&#x27;s growing reputation, a number of figures who were influential in the renewal movement of the Church early in the 19th century came to visit her, among them Clemens August von Droste zu Vischering, the future Archbishop of Cologne; Johann Michael Sailer, the Bishop of Ratisbon, since 1803 the sole surviving Elector Spiritual of the Holy Roman Empire; Bernhard Overberg and authors Luise Hensel and Friedrich Stolberg. Clemens von Droste, at the time still vicar‑general of the Archdiocese, called Emmerich &quot;a special friend of God&quot; in a letter he wrote to Stolberg.

===According to Clemens Maria Brentano===

At the time of Emmerich&#x27;s second examination in 1819, Brentano visited her. He claimed that she told him he was sent to help her fulfill God&#x27;s command, to express in writing the revelations made to her. Brentano became one of Emmerich&#x27;s many supporters at the time, believing her to be a &quot;chosen Bride of Christ&quot;. Professor Andrew Weeks claims that Brentano&#x27;s own personal complexes were a factor in substituting Emmerich as a maternal figure in his own life.

From 1819 until Emmerich&#x27;s death in 1824, Brentano filled many notebooks with accounts of her visions involving scenes from the New Testament and the life of the Virgin Mary. Because Emmerich only spoke the Westphalian dialect, Brentano could not transcribe her words directly, and often could not even take notes in her presence, so he would quickly write in standard German when he returned to his own apartment a set of notes based on what he remembered of the conversations he had with Emmerich. Brentano edited the notes later, years after the death of Emmerich.

About ten years after Emmerich had recounted her visions, Brentano completed editing his records for publication. In 1833, he published his first volume, &quot;The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ According to the Meditations of Anne Catherine Emmerich&quot;. Brentano then prepared &quot;The Life of the Blessed Virgin Mary from the Visions of Anna Catherine Emmerich&quot; for publication, but he died in 1842. The book was published posthumously in 1852 in Munich.

Catholic priest Karl Schmoger edited Brentano&#x27;s manuscripts and from 1858 to 1860 published the three volumes of &quot;The Life of Our Lord&quot;. In 1881, a large illustrated edition followed. Schmoger also penned a biography of Anne Catherine Emmerich in two volumes from 1867 to 1870 that has been republished in English language editions.

The Vatican does not endorse the authenticity of the books written by Brentano. However, it views their general message as &quot;an outstanding proclamation of the gospel in service to salvation&quot;. Other critics have been less sympathetic and have characterized the books Brentano produced from his notes as &quot;conscious elaborations of an overwrought romantic poet&quot;.

Brentano wrote that Emmerich said she believed that Noah&#x27;s son Ham was the progenitor of &quot;the black, idolatrous, stupid nations&quot; of the world. The &quot;Dolorous Passion&quot; is claimed to reveal a &quot;clear antisemitic strain throughout&quot;, with Brentano writing that Emmerich believed that &quot;Jews[...] strangled Christian children and used their blood for all sorts of suspicious and diabolical practices&quot;.

===Claims of forgery===

When the case for Emmerich&#x27;s beatification was submitted to the Vatican in 1892, a number of experts in Germany began to compare and analyze Brentano&#x27;s original notes from his personal library with the books he had written. The analysis revealed various apocryphal biblical sources, maps, and travel guides among his papers, which could have been used to exaggerate or embellish some of Emmerich&#x27;s narrations.

In his 1923 theological thesis, German priest Winfried Hümpfner, who had compared Brentano&#x27;s original notes to the published books, wrote that Brentano had fabricated much of the material he had attributed to Emmerich.

By 1928, the experts had come to the conclusion that only a small portion of Brentano&#x27;s books could be safely attributed to Emmerich.

At the time of Emmerich&#x27;s beatification in 2004, the Vatican position on the authenticity of the Brentano books was elucidated by priest Peter Gumpel, who was involved in the study of the issues for the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints: &quot;It is absolutely not certain that she ever wrote this. There is a serious problem of authenticity.&quot; According to Gumpel, the writings attributed to Emmerich were &quot;absolutely discarded&quot; by the Vatican as part of her beatification process.

==Death and burial==
Emmerich began to grow weaker during the summer of 1823. She died on 9 February 1824 in Dülmen and was buried in the graveyard outside the town, with a large number of people attending her funeral. Her grave was reopened twice in the weeks following the funeral, due to a false rumor that her body had been desecrated and stolen, but the coffin and the body were found to be intact.

In February 1975, Emmerich&#x27;s remains were permanently moved to the Church of the Holy Cross in Dülmen. Due to the cult of piety established after her death, most especially amongst Traditionalist Catholics, slips of paper with thanksgiving or personal intentions are collected at her tombstone and burned annually on Easter Sunday.

==The House of the Virgin Mary==

Neither Brentano nor Emmerich had ever been to Ephesus, and indeed the city had not yet been excavated; but visions contained in &quot;The Life of The Blessed Virgin Mary&quot; were used during the discovery of the House of the Virgin Mary, the Blessed Virgin&#x27;s supposed home before her Assumption, located on a hill near Ephesus, as described in the book &quot;Mary&#x27;s House&quot;.

Emmerich described Mary&#x27;s house:

In 1881, a French Catholic priest, Julien Gouyet, used Emmerich&#x27;s book to search for the house in Ephesus and found it based on the descriptions. He was not taken seriously at first, but sister Marie de Mandat-Grancey persisted until two other priests followed the same path and confirmed the finding.

Pope Leo XIII visited the shrine in 1896. Pope Pius X granted a plenary indulgence to the pilgrimage to the shrine in 1914 and sent his blessing to &quot;the valiant searchers for the tomb of the Most Blessed Virgin.&quot; Pope Pius XII initially declared the house a &quot;Holy Place&quot; (1951). As Apostolic Nuncio, the former Cardinal Angelo Roncalli visited the shrine (1935), and later as Pope John XXIII later made the Pian declaration permanent . Pope Paul VI (1967), Pope John Paul II (1979) and Pope Benedict XVI (2006) visited the house and current shrine.

==Beatification==
Pope John Paul II on 3 October 2004 declared the following: 
The process of Emmerich&#x27;s beatification was started in 1892 by the Bishop of Münster, and her cause was officially opened by the Vatican on 12 June 1899. The process of evaluating her spiritual writings began on 22 April 1901. In 1928, however, the Vatican suspended the process when it was suspected that Clemens Brentano had fabricated some of the material that appeared in the books he wrote, and which he had attributed to Emmerich.

In 1973, the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints allowed the case for her beatification to be re-opened, provided it only focused on the issue of her life, without any reference to the possibly doctored material produced by Clemens Brentano.

In July 2003, the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints promulgated a decree of a miracle attributed to her, and that paved the way for her beatification.

On 3 October 2004, Anne Catherine Emmerich was beatified by Pope John Paul II. However, the books produced by Brentano were set aside, and her cause adjudicated solely on the basis of her own personal sanctity and virtue. Peter Gumpel, who was involved in the analysis of the matter at the Vatican, told &quot;Catholic News Service&quot;:

==In film==
In 2003, actor and director Mel Gibson used Brentano&#x27;s book &quot;The Dolorous Passion&quot; as a key source for his 2004 film &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;. Gibson stated that Scripture and &quot;accepted visions&quot; were the only sources he drew on, and a careful reading of Brentano&#x27;s book shows the film&#x27;s high level of dependence on it.

In 2007 German director Dominik Graf made the movie &quot;The Pledge&quot; as a dramatization of the encounters between Emmerich (portrayed by actress ) and Clemens Brentano, based on a novel by Kai Meyer.

<text>Mijailo Mijailović (; born 6 December 1978) is the self-confessed and convicted assassin of the Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs Anna Lindh, whom he stabbed on 10 September 2003 at the NK department store in Stockholm. Lindh died early the following day after unsuccessful surgical treatment to try to save her life.

==Early life==
Mijailo was born in Stockholm, Sweden, on 6 December 1978 to Serbian parents from the town of Mladenovac. His parents immigrated to Sweden in the late 1960s as foreign workers. When he was 6 years old, he was sent to live with his paternal grandparents in Serbia, where he went to school. He returned to Sweden when the Yugoslav Wars began. He finished school in 1995, with a grade point average of 3.4 (out of 5.0). He enrolled in Swedish high school but dropped out in the second grade. His school mates remember him as a lone wolf.

In 1997, at 18 years old, he stabbed his father and was convicted of aggravated assault. His father was an alcoholic, and often assaulted Mijailo&#x27;s mother and children. In June 1999, he was convicted of holding illegal arms; he had a knife on him. In April, the same year, he threatened a young girl and her mother.

==Assassination and conviction==
On the afternoon of 10 September 2003, Mijailo Mijailović attacked Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs Anna Lindh, while she was shopping in the ladies&#x27; department at the NK department store in central Stockholm. Lindh was stabbed in her chest, stomach and arms. The minister was rushed to a hospital and underwent extensive surgery, but died the following morning. Mijailović was able to flee the scene after the crime, but was arrested two weeks later with the help of surveillance photos from the department store.
Swedish newspapers have suggested that Mijailović was released from a mental institution just five days before the killing of Lindh, that he has serious mental problems, and had previously been convicted of violent crimes. His motive was not considered political, although Mijailović shortly after his arrest was identified on a photograph as standing in the front row of a crowd adhering to then–Liberal People&#x27;s Party chairman Lars Leijonborg delivering a speech. A pamphlet taken from the party&#x27;s electoral cabin was also retrieved among the belongings he had dumped shortly after the murder.

On 6 January 2004, after being presented with the evidence against him, Mijailović confessed to the police that he had stabbed Anna Lindh, without the intention to kill her. He said, &quot;I&#x27;m not interested in politics&quot;, and &quot;It could have been someone other than Anna Lindh. I have nothing personal against Anna Lindh.&quot; The court trial against Mijailović took place from 14 to 17 January 2004. He was found guilty, but the sentencing was postponed to await the recommendations of a psychiatric evaluation ordered by the court.

On 9 March, a report concluded that Mijailović was not considered to be criminally insane at the time of the assassination, and on 23 March, he was sentenced to life imprisonment. However, on 8 July, an appeals court overturned that sentence after tests had concluded that he was suffering from a mental illness at the time of the killing. As a result of the appeals court decision, Mijailović was taken from prison to a closed psychiatric hospital.

Mijailović was for some time a citizen of both Serbia and Montenegro and Sweden but after the crime applied to have his Swedish citizenship revoked. His application was granted by the Swedish Migration Agency on 20 September 2004; however, this did not have any effect on the judicial process.

On 2 December 2004, Mijailović was sentenced by the Supreme Court of Sweden to life imprisonment for the killing of Anna Lindh, overruling the appeals court judgement. He has since attempted to have himself relocated to a Serbian prison, expressing fear for his life. As of 2022, these attempts have been without success.

==2011 interview==
In August 2011 Mijailović gave an interview in the Swedish newspaper &quot;Expressen&quot;, his first such interview since his arrest, in which he talked about the murder of Lindh. Mijailović explains in the interview that the murder was motivated by his hatred of politicians, whom he considered responsible for his hopeless life situation and the fact that he was a &quot;man without a future&quot;. Mijailović had met Lindh at the entrance of the NK department store, when Lindh was on her way in. Mijailović recognized her and decided to attack her. He went into the store looking for Lindh on several floors before he finally found her and carried out the attack. He then fled the scene, expecting the police would soon apprehend him.

Mijailović claims not to have been mentally ill at the time. &quot;Feeling bad is not the same as being sick&quot;, he explained. The reason that he tried to appear as being mentally ill following his arrest was his belief that life in a psychiatric hospital would be easier than in a prison. Mijailović also revealed in the interview that he had wanted to attack the politician Lars Leijonborg the day before the murder of Lindh , but that he did not have his knife with him at the time. Mijailović says he now realizes that it was wrong to blame his own failures in life on politicians and that he has caused a lot of sorrow.

<text>Hutton Peter Gibson (August 26, 1918 – May 11, 2020) was an American conspiracy theorist, holocaust denier, writer on sedevacantism, a World War II veteran, the &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; grand champion for 1968, and the father of 11 children, one of whom is the actor and director Mel Gibson.

Gibson was a critic both of the post-Vatican II Catholic Church and of those Traditionalist Catholics who reject sedevacantism, such as the Society of Saint Pius X. He claimed that the Second Vatican Council was &quot;a Masonic plot backed by the Jews&quot;.

==Early life and family==
Gibson was born in Peekskill, New York, the son of businessman John Hutton Gibson (1884–1937) and Australian opera singer Eva Mylott (1875–1920). His maternal grandparents were Irish immigrants to Australia, while his father, who was from a wealthy tobacco-producing family from the American South, had Irish, English, Scottish, and Welsh ancestry. He was raised in Chicago. His mother died when he was two years old and his father died when he was nineteen. Gibson supported his younger brother, Alexis, who died in his early twenties. He graduated from high school early, at age 15, and ranked third in his class.

According to Wensley Clarkson&#x27;s biography of Mel Gibson, Hutton Gibson studied for the priesthood in a Chicago seminary which was operated by the Society of the Divine Word but he left the seminary because he considered the modernist theological doctrines which were being taught there disgusting. However, in 2003, Gibson stated that he really left the seminary because he did not want to be sent to New Guinea or the Philippines as a missionary. Instead, he found work with Western Union and the Civilian Conservation Corps. He also contributed to and edited the newsletter &quot;The Pointer&quot; while he worked in Wisconsin for the Civilian Conservation Corps from 1938 to 1939.

After serving with the United States Army as a Signal Corps Officer at the Battle of Guadalcanal, Gibson married Irish-born Anne Patricia Reilly on May 1, 1944, at the Catholic parish church of Our Lady of Good Counsel in Brooklyn, New York. They had ten children and adopted another one after their arrival in Australia. As of 2003, Gibson had 48 grandchildren and 15 great-grandchildren. His wife died in December 1990. In January 2002, he married Teddy Joye Hicks, but in 2012 Gibson filed for divorce due to irreconcilable differences. From early 2006, he resided in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh after moving from Australia to Houston, Texas, in 1999, and to Summersville, West Virginia, in 2003.

==Railroad lawsuit and move to Australia==
In the 1960s, Gibson worked for New York Central Railroad. In the early morning hours of December 11, 1964, he slipped off a steel platform which was covered in oil and snow and injured his back. A work injury lawsuit followed and finally reached court on February 7, 1968. Seven days later, Gibson was awarded $145,000 () by the jury. Gibson paid his debts and attorney&#x27;s fees and later that year, he relocated his family, first to Ireland, then to Australia.

Gibson said in 2003 that the move to his mother&#x27;s native country was undertaken because he believed that the Australian Army would reject his oldest son for the Australian Vietnam War draft, unlike the American military. Because of his back injuries, Gibson sought retraining in a new career. He was encouraged to become a computer programmer after IQ testing placed him in the genius range.

At the October 1976 Annual General Meeting of the Latin Mass Society of Australia, Gibson resigned as secretary after becoming increasingly vocal in expressing the allegation that the See of Peter is vacant due to Pope John XXIII, who convened the Second Vatican Council, and accusing subsequent popes of being heretical antipopes. He later founded an organisation called the Alliance for Catholic Truth.

==Quiz show contestant==
In 1968, Gibson appeared on the Art Fleming-hosted version of the game show &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; as &quot;Red Gibson, a railroad brakeman from South Ozone Park, New York&quot;. Gibson won $4,680 and retired undefeated after five shows, in accordance with the rules of the show then in use. He was invited back to appear in the 1968 Tournament of Champions, where he became the year&#x27;s grand champion, winning slightly over one thousand dollars more, as well as a two-person cruise to the West Indies. Art Fleming observed on the October 18, 1968, episode that the &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; staff had had difficulty informing Gibson about his invitation as Gibson had decamped with his family to County Tipperary, Ireland.

Gibson later participated in many Australian quiz shows, including &quot;Big Nine&quot; with Athol Guy and &quot;Ford Superquiz&quot; with Bert Newton. In 1986, &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; reported that Gibson had recently won $100,000 and an automobile in a TV quiz program.

==Beliefs==
Gibson was an outspoken critic of the Catholic Church‘s doctrine, leadership, and practice since the Second Vatican Council. He disseminated his views in a quarterly newsletter called &quot;The War is Now!&quot; and self-published three collections of these periodicals: &quot;Is the Pope Catholic?&quot;, &quot;The Enemy is Here!&quot;, and &quot;The Enemy is Still Here!&quot;

Gibson was especially critical of Pope John Paul II, whom he once described as &quot;Garrulous Karolus the Koran-Kisser&quot;. His allegation that the Pope kissed the Quran is corroborated by a FIDES News Service report of June 1, 1999, which quotes the Chaldean Catholic Patriarch, Raphael I Bidawid, as having confirmed to the news service that he was personally present when John Paul II kissed the text, which is sacred to Muslims:

Gibson also used his newsletter to argue against Feeneyism. At the January 2004 We The People conference, Gibson advocated that the states should secede from the Federal government of the United States and the United States public debt should be abolished.

One week before Mel Gibson&#x27;s &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; (2004) was released in American film theaters, Hutton Gibson told radio talk show host Steve Feuerstein that the Holocaust was fabricated and &quot;mostly fictional&quot;. He said that the Jews had simply emigrated to other countries rather than having been killed, a view which observers described as Holocaust denial. He claimed that census statistics prove that there were more Jews in Europe &quot;after&quot; World War II than before. Gibson said that certain Jews advocate a global religion and one world government.

In his interview for &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; article, Gibson dismissed historical accounts that six million Jews were exterminated:

Gibson was further quoted as saying that the Second Vatican Council was &quot;a Masonic plot backed by the Jews&quot; and the September 11, 2001 attacks were perpetrated by remote control: &quot;Hutton flatly rejected that Al Qaeda hijackers had anything to do with the attacks. &#x27;Anybody can put out a passenger list,&#x27; he said&quot;.

In the early 1990s, Gibson and Tom Costello hosted a video called &quot;Catholics, Where Has Our Church Gone?&quot;. It is critical of the changes made within the Catholic Church by the Second Vatican Council and espouses the Siri thesis that in 1958, after the death of Pope Pius XII, the man originally elected pope was not Angelo Roncalli, but another cardinal, &quot;probably Cardinal Siri of Genoa&quot; (a staunch conservative candidate and first papabile). Gibson stated that the white smoke that emanated from a chimney in the Sistine Chapel to announce a new pope&#x27;s election was done in error; black smoke signifying that the papacy was still vacant was quickly created, and the public was not informed of the reason for the initial white smoke. A still photograph of a newspaper story about this event is shown. &quot;Had our church gone up in smoke?&quot; asked Gibson. He stated that the new pope was forced to resign under duress, and two days later, the &quot;modernist Roncalli&quot; was elected pope and took the name &quot;John XXIII&quot;. In 1962, Roncalli, as Pope John XXIII convened the Second Vatican Council. In 2006, Hutton Gibson reversed his position on the Siri thesis, asserting that this theory was based on a mistranslation of an article written on October 27, 1958, by Silvio Negro for the evening edition of the Milan-based &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot;.

A similar event happened in 1939; a confusing mixture of white and black smoke emanated from the Sistine Chapel chimney. In a note to Vatican Radio, the secretary of the Papal conclave at the time, a monsignor named Santoro said that a new pope, Eugenio Pacelli, had been properly elected regardless of the color of the smoke. Pacelli took the name Pius XII.

Gibson endorsed Ron Paul for president in the 2008 United States Presidential Election. In January 2010, he made an appearance on the far-right-wing radio show, &quot;The Political Cesspool&quot;, to promote his views. In August 2010, he made another appearance on &quot;The Political Cesspool&quot; during which he made a widely discussed allegation that Pope Benedict XVI is &quot;homosexual&quot; and &quot;half the people in the Vatican are queer&quot;. During the same interview, he also claimed that the Pope was a Freemason.

==Local congregation support==
In 2006, Gibson&#x27;s foundation, The World Faith Foundation of California, which is funded by Mel Gibson, purchased an existing church structure in the Pittsburgh suburb of Unity, Pennsylvania, and used it to establish a Tridentine sedevacantist congregation called St. Michael the Archangel Roman Catholic Chapel. Rev. Leonard Bealko, purportedly a former Roman Catholic priest who had left the church voluntarily in 1986, was appointed pastor. By mid-2007, Gibson and his fellow congregants had dismissed Bealko and dissolved the congregation amid charges that Bealko had misrepresented his credentials and mishandled its finances.

==Death==
Gibson died at a medical center in Thousand Oaks, California, on May 11, 2020, at the age of 101.

<text>Giaches de Wert (also Jacques/Jaches de Wert, Giaches de Vuert; 1535 – 6 May 1596) was a Franco-Flemish composer of the late Renaissance, active in Italy. Intimately connected with the progressive musical center of Ferrara, he was one of the leaders in developing the style of the late Renaissance madrigal. He was one of the most influential of late sixteenth-century madrigal composers, particularly on Claudio Monteverdi, and his later music was formative on the development of music of the early Baroque era.

==Life==

Little is known about his early life, except that he was from Flanders, from either the vicinity of Ghent or Weert, near Antwerp. As a boy he went to Avellino in southern Italy, near Naples, where he became a choir boy in the chapel of Maria di Cardona, Marchesa of Padulla. Maria was the wife of Francesco d&#x27;Este, Marchese di Massalombarda, a captain under Charles V; Francesco was a son of the notorious Lucrezia Borgia, and her husband Alfonso I d&#x27;Este. Francesco was often in France and adjacent areas on military campaigns, and as an adjunct to these adventures he brought musically talented youths back to Italy with him. Wert&#x27;s association with the Este family was to endure through most of his life.

Sometime before 1550 he began his association with the Gonzaga family. Most likely around 1550 he moved to Novellara, a town in what is now the Province of Reggio Emilia, as a musician in the service of a branch of the Gonzagas; a previous suggestion that he may have been in Rome has not been securely established. Novellara in the mid-sixteenth century was a significant musical center under its local branch of the Gonzaga family. Alfonso I built a theatre and staged dramatic performances at his castle, with his young Flemish choirmaster in charge.

Relations between the Gonzaga and Este families were close, and in the early 1550s Wert traveled at least once to Mantua and Ferrara, centers of musical activity in the late sixteenth century, where he met the renowned madrigalist Cipriano de Rore, who was the most influential figure on his early musical style. While in Novellara, Wert married Lucrezia Gonzaga and raised a family, having at least six children. Wert stayed in Novellara until the early 1560s, at which time he accepted the position of &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; for the main Gonzaga chapel in Milan; however, he did not stay long there, moving in 1565 to Mantua where he became &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; at the chapel of Santa Barbara.

It was in Mantua that Lucrezia, Wert&#x27;s wife, began an affair with Agostino Bonvicino, a Mantuan composer who was Wert&#x27;s competitor at Santa Barbara. When this affair was discovered in 1570, she was forced to leave Mantua, with Wert remaining behind. Wert persisted in his job, despite the censure of the choir for being a cuckold. However, Lucrezia&#x27;s subsequent misfortunes exceeded those of Wert. On returning to Novellara, she became sexually involved with Claudio, an illegitimate son of Count Francesco of Novellara, and took part in a plot to murder his uncle on the death of his father as an attempt to gain his inheritance and title; while Claudio escaped justice, Lucrezia was caught with some of the other conspirators, and she died in prison in 1584.

While Wert endured the humiliating situation in Mantua through the late 1560s, he kept his job: he was to remain at least nominally &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; in Mantua until 1592. The 1560s were productive years for Wert musically, as he produced his first four books of five-voice madrigals during this time, and his first book for four voices. The dedications are significant: one is to Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba, Duke of Sessa, and in the dedicatory preface Wert thanks him for the opportunity to lead his choir. (Fernández de Córdoba was Governor of Milan from 1558 to 1560.) During the late 1560s Wert had several offers of employment elsewhere, but turned them down. The most significant came in Augsburg in 1566, where Wert&#x27;s spectacular ability to improvise counterpoint engendered an offer to join the imperial court in Prague, serving Maximilian II, the Holy Roman Emperor. The next job offer he refused came from Parma the next year, the home of the Farnese family. However he became increasingly close to the Este court in Ferrara during the 1570s and 1580s, without actually becoming employed there. While the two courts were closely connected by marriage and mutual interchange of musicians, Ferrara was a place with a profoundly different outlook from Mantua: Ferrara was progressive, while Mantua was supportive of the Counter-Reformation; the progressive tendencies of Ferrara better fitted Wert&#x27;s musical inclinations. Wert had a good time there; so much so that his employer in Mantua sent a strongly worded letter on 22 December 1584 demanding his immediate return to his post. Wert, however, had fallen in love with the widowed Tarquinia Molza, the most famous female singer and poet in Italy, who was a lady-in-waiting at the Este court, so he endeavored to spend as much time as possible in Ferrara. This was the same year that Lucrezia, Wert&#x27;s wife, died in prison in Novellara.

Tarquinia, unlike Wert, but like Lucrezia, was a member of the nobility, and when her affair with Wert was found out in 1589 – their affair was plagued with spies, and their love-letters opened – she was banished to Modena. Wert may have been previously married to nobility, but in Ferrara he was still a servant, and his affair was considered as scandalous there as was Lucrezia&#x27;s in Mantua.

Wert first became ill with malaria in 1582, and ill-health was to bedevil him for the rest of his life. Even so, he remained musically productive, writing a coronation mass for Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga in 1587, and numerous madrigals for the &quot;concerto delle donne&quot;, the renowned group of musical ladies of Ferrara, who were virtuoso singers. In 1592, Giovanni Giacomo Gastoldi took over his post as &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; in Mantua, and in August 1595 he dedicated his last book of madrigals. Wert died in 1596 in Mantua, in his house near the ducal palace; his tomb is near to that of his contemporary Francesco Rovigo, in the crypt of Santa Barbara, beneath the church where he worked for many years.

==Music and influence==

===Secular===
While Wert wrote both sacred and secular music, as well as a handful of instrumental fantasias, his madrigals were by far the most famous portion of his output during his lifetime. He wrote approximately 230, which he published in sixteen separate books spread across a half-century, from 1558 to the final posthumous collection in 1608. His madrigal books are almost all for five voices, although he published one book in 1561 for four, and the posthumous collection of 1608 includes pieces ranging from four to seven voices.

Wert&#x27;s early style was heavily influenced by Cipriano de Rore, the renowned mid-century madrigalist active at Ferrara. Wert&#x27;s first three books show some features typical of Rore&#x27;s writing, such as chromaticism, word-painting, and, according to Alfred Einstein, an &quot;indifference to everything merely formal and ... [a] striving for the most intense expression.&quot; In the manner of Adrian Willaert&#x27;s madrigals, he also explored distant tonal regions, while avoiding jarring harmonic progressions. In addition, he showed a preference for a declamatory, homophonic style, which he refined later in his career into a &quot;seconda prattica&quot; manner influential on Monteverdi, and he also showed a liking for high voices – something which turned out to be a defining characteristic of the music-making at the Este court in Ferrara. The poems he chose to set for his early books include examples by Pietro Bembo, Petrarch and Ariosto.

Wert&#x27;s style at mid-career began to change away from the Rore manner towards one more closely aligned with the Venetians, such as Andrea Gabrieli. Pure homophony became more common in his works, and he began to exploit registral and textural contrasts rather than switch from polyphony to homophony; in addition, his lines became more lyrical. His preferred poets changed as well: while early in his career he had used Bembo and Petrarch, and later Ariosto, he shifted to Guarini and Torquato Tasso. In his sixth book of madrigals for five voices (1577), he included three madrigal cycles, an innovation which was to become a prominent musical subgenre near the end of the century. The cycles include two canzoni by Petrarch and a capitolo by Ariosto; they are set in a declamatory manner, thereby including a treatment of vocal lines which foreshadowed monody, and Wert&#x27;s own later works.

Once Wert made the acquaintance of the virtuoso singing ladies of Ferrara, the &quot;concerto delle dame&quot;, he began to write madrigals for them in an appropriate style – with elaborate parts for three high voices, often containing separate blocks for high and low voices, and the most virtuosic singing required in the topmost part. His music during this period was influenced by the other composers working in Ferrara, including Luzzasco Luzzaschi, and his favorite poets of the time were those most closely associated with Ferrara – Tasso and Guarini. In his tenth book of madrigals (1591), six of the compositions may have been intended for a solo singer with instrumental accompaniment, in the manner of the monodies which were one of the forerunners of opera. The late music is tonal, anticipating the changes in musical language of the early Baroque, during which functional tonality crystallized out of the pre-tonal universe of the late Renaissance; in addition these late compositions are mainly homophonic, with only occasional polyphonic passages appearing as an animating contrast. An influence from the Venetians is his occasional use of the concertato style, with groups of voices in dialogue.

For his final madrigal book published in his lifetime, the eleventh, he set passages from Guarini&#x27;s &quot;Il pastor fido&quot;, one of the most popular texts for musical setting of the era. The final collection published under Wert&#x27;s name came out posthumously in 1608, and contained pieces for four to seven voices. One of its madrigals was a setting of Guarini&#x27;s notorious &quot;Tirsi morir volea&quot;, an obscene poem that Einstein called &quot;worthless, indeed contemptible&quot;, and &quot;...more obscene than the coarsest &quot;mascherata&quot;, the most suggestive &quot;canto carnascialesco&quot;, or the most impertinent chanson ... could not be more removed from true poetry&quot; but yet which was the most-often set individual poem of the late sixteenth century. It portrayed a nymph and a shepherd attempting, by speeding up and slowing down, to achieve simultaneous orgasm, with multiple &quot;double entendres&quot; on &quot;death&quot; and &quot;dying&quot;; the popularity of this poem was enormous. Wert wrote his setting in 1581.

===Sacred ===
Wert wrote a considerable amount of sacred music, but little of it was published during his lifetime. He published only three books of motets, one in 1566 and the other two in 1581; a few of his works, such as the &quot;Missa Dominicalis&quot; appeared in anthologies with the music of other composers. His other six masses remained in manuscript, as did the majority of the music he wrote for Santa Barbara in Mantua. Most likely this was because he was commissioned to write that music, such as his cycle of 127 hymns, specifically for that institution, and his publisher was in Venice.

The style of his sacred music varies from simple homophony, designed for absolute clarity of textual expression in conformance with the dictates of the Council of Trent (as Mantua was a center of the Counter-Reformation, this was to be expected), to motet settings similar in expressive intensity to his madrigals including passages of surprising chromaticism not unlike that of Gesualdo. This is particularly true in the 1581 collections: &quot;Ascendente Jesu&quot;, for example, contains colorful examples of text-painting such as he used in the works he was composing for the Ferrarese court at the time.

All of Wert&#x27;s works, both sacred and secular, have been compiled and edited by Carol MacClintock and M. Bernstein in CMM series xxiv.

<doc id="327655" wikidata="Q312771" url="?curid=327655" title="Pierre André Latreille">
<text>Pierre André Latreille (; 29 November 1762 – 6 February 1833) was a French zoologist, specialising in arthropods. Having trained as a Roman Catholic priest before the French Revolution, Latreille was imprisoned, and only regained his freedom after recognising a rare beetle species he found in the prison, &quot;Necrobia ruficollis.&quot;

He published his first important work, , in 1796, and was eventually employed by the . His foresighted work on arthropod systematics and taxonomy gained him respect and accolades, including being asked to write the volume on insects for George Cuvier&#x27;s monumental work, , the only part not by Cuvier himself.

Latreille was considered the foremost entomologist of his time, and was described by one of his pupils as &quot;the prince of entomologists&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Pierre André Latreille was born on 29 November 1762 in the town of Brive, then in the province of Limousin, as the illegitimate child of Jean Joseph Sahuguet d&#x27;Amarzit, général baron d&#x27;Espagnac, who never recognised him, and an unknown mother, who abandoned him at birth; the surname &quot;Latreille&quot; was formally granted to him in 1813, and derives from a nickname of unclear provenance. Latreille, effectively orphaned from his earliest age, but had influential protectors – first a physician, then a merchant from Brive, and later a baron (after the baron&#x27;s death), who brought him to Paris in 1778.

He studied initially in Brive and in Paris at the attached to the University of Paris to become a priest. He entered the of Limoges in 1780, and left as a deacon in 1786. Despite being qualified to preach, Latreille later wrote that he had never carried out his functions as a minister, although for a few years he signed the letters he wrote &quot;&quot; (&quot;the Reverend Latreille&quot;) or &quot;&quot; (&quot;Latreille, Priest&quot;).

Even during his studies, Latreille had taken on an interest in natural history, visiting the planted by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, and catching insects around Paris. He received lessons on botany from René Just Haüy, which brought him in contact with Jean-Baptiste Lamarck.

===&quot;Necrobia ruficollis&quot;===

After the fall of the and the start of the French Revolution, the Civil Constitution of the Clergy was declared in 1790, which required priests to swear an oath of allegiance to the state. Latreille failed to do so and was therefore imprisoned in November 1793 under threat of execution.

When the prison&#x27;s doctor inspected the prisoners, he was surprised to find Latreille scrutinising a beetle on the dungeon floor. When Latreille explained that it was a rare insect, the physician was impressed, and sent the insect to a 15-year-old local naturalist, Jean Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent. Bory de St.-Vincent knew Latreille&#x27;s work, and managed to obtain the release of Latreille and one of his cell-mates. Latreille and Bory de Saint-Vincent remained life-long friends. The beetle had been described by Johan Christian Fabricius in 1775, but recognising it had saved Latreille from likely demise, as all the other inmates were dead within one month.

Thereafter, Latreille lived as a teacher and corresponded with various entomologists, including Fabricius. In 1796, and with Fabricius&#x27; encouragement, Latreille published his at his own expense. He was briefly placed under house arrest in 1797, and his books were confiscated, but the influence of Georges Cuvier, Bernard Germain de Lacépède and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (who all held chairs of zoology at the recently instituted ) succeeded in freeing Latreille. In 1798, Latreille was appointed to the Muséum, where he worked alongside Lamarck, curating the arthropod collections, and published a number of zoological works.

===First Empire===
Following the death of the entomologist Guillaume-Antoine Olivier in 1814, Latreille succeeded him as titular member of the . In the following few years, Latreille was especially productive, producing important papers for the , all of the volume on arthropods for George Cuvier&#x27;s &quot;Le Règne Animal&quot; (&quot;The Animal Kingdom&quot;, 1817), and hundreds of entries in the on entomological subjects. In 1819, Latreille was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia. As Lamarck became blind, Latreille took on an increasing proportion of his teaching and research work. In 1821, Latreille was made a knight of the . In 1829 he succeeded Lamarck as professor of entomology.

===Later years===

From 1824, Latreille&#x27;s health deteriorated. He handed his lectures over to Jean Victoire Audouin and took on several assistants for his research work, including Amédée Louis Michel Lepeletier, Jean Guillaume Audinet-Serville and Félix Édouard Guérin-Méneville. He was instrumental in the founding of the , and served as its honorary president.

Latreille&#x27;s wife became ill in 1830 and died in May of that year; the date of Latreille&#x27;s marriage is unclear, and his request to be released from his vow of celibacy was never acknowledged. He resigned his position at the museum on 10 April 1832, in order to move to the country and thereby avoid the cholera epidemic. He returned to Paris in November, and died of bladder disease on 6 February 1833. He had no children but was survived by a niece whom he had adopted.

===Commemoration===
The raised the money to pay for a monument to Latreille. This was erected over Latreille&#x27;s grave at Père Lachaise Cemetery (39th division), and comprised a obelisk with various inscriptions, including one to the beetle which had saved Latreille&#x27;s life: &quot; (&quot;Necrobia ruficollis&quot;, Latreille&#x27;s saviour&quot;).

As testimony to the high esteem in which Latreille was held, many books were dedicated to him, and up to 163 species were named in his honour between 1798 and 1850. Taxa commemorating Latreille include:
* &quot;Lumbrineris latreilli&quot; 
* &quot;Cecrops latreillii&quot; 
* &quot;Apseudes latreillii&quot; 
* &quot;Orbinia latreillii&quot; 
* &quot;Latreillia&quot; 
* &quot;Cilicaea latreillei&quot; 
* &quot;Bittium latreillii&quot; 
* &quot;Macrophthalmus latreillei&quot; 
* &quot;Eurypodius latreillei&quot; 
* &quot;Sphex latreillei&quot; 

==Work==
Latreille produced a significant body of scientific work, extending across several fields. He was described by Johan Christian Fabricius as (&quot;the foremost entomologist of our time&quot;), and by Jean Victoire Audouin as (&quot;the prince of entomology&quot;).

===Taxonomy and systematics===
Latreille was significant as the first person to attempt a natural classification of the arthropods. His &quot;eclectic method&quot; of systematics incorporated evidence from all available characters without assuming a pre-defined goal; Latreille repeatedly dismissed anthropocentrism and teleology.

As well as many species and countless genera, the names of many higher taxa are also attributable to Latreille, including Thysanura, Siphonaptera, Ostracoda, Stomatopoda, Xiphosura, and Myriapoda.

===Typification===
Although Latreille named many species, his primary interest was in describing genera. He introduced the concept of the &quot;type species&quot;, a species to which the name of a genus is firmly attached. Similarly, he favoured the method of naming families after one of the constituent genera, rather than some defining feature of the group, implicitly designating a type genus for the family.

<doc id="327662" wikidata="Q699797" url="?curid=327662" title="Eight Provinces of Korea">
<text>During most of the Joseon dynasty, Korea was divided into eight provinces (&quot;do&quot;; ). The eight provinces&#x27; boundaries remained unchanged for about 480 years from 1413 to 1895, and formed a geographic paradigm that is still reflected today in the Korean Peninsula&#x27;s administrative divisions, dialects, and regional distinctions. The names of all eight provinces are still preserved today, in one form or another. These eight historical provinces form both North and South Korea, and are not to be confused with the provinces that make up North Korea or South Korea.

==History==
===Provinces before 1895===
In 1413 (the 13th year of the reign of King Jeongjong), the north-eastern boundary of Korea was extended to the Tumen River. The country was reorganized into eight provinces: Chungcheong, Gangwon, Gyeonggi, Gyeongsang, Jeolla, P&#x27;unghae (renamed Hwanghae in 1417), P&#x27;yŏngan, and Yŏnggil (eventually renamed Hamgyŏng in 1509).

===Districts of 1895–96===
For almost 500 years, the eight-province system remained virtually unchanged. In 1895 (the 32nd year of the reign of King Gojong), the five-century-old provincial system was abolished. On May 26 of that year—as part of the Gabo Reform—the country was redivided into 23 districts, each named for the city or county that was its capital.

Each district name in the following list links to the article on the province from which the district was formed, and where more detailed information on the district is provided:
*Andong
*Chuncheon
*Chungju
*Daegu
*Dongnae
*Gangneung
*Gongju
*Haeju
*Hamhŭng
*Hanseong
*Hongju
*Incheon
*Jeju
*Jeonju
*Jinju
*Kaesŏng
*Kanggye
*Kapsan
*Kyŏngsŏng
*Naju
*Namwon
*P&#x27;yŏngyang
*Ŭiju
===Restored provinces of 1896===

The new system of districts did not last long, however, as one year later, on August 4, 1896, the former eight provinces were restored, with five of them (Chungcheong, Gyeongsang, Jeolla, Hamgyŏng, and P&#x27;yŏngan), being divided into north and south halves, to form a total of 13 provinces. This structure remained unchanged through the entire lifetime of the Korean Empire (1897–1910) and the Japanese Colonial Period (1910–1945). Since the end of World War II and the division of Korea in 1945, special cities and administrative regions and a handful of new provinces have been added in both the South and North.

==Cultural significance==
The boundaries between the eight provinces for the most part followed rivers, mountain chains, and other natural boundaries, and consequently corresponded closely to dialect and cultural divisions. Because of this natural fit between the provincial boundaries and the &quot;real world,&quot; most of the provincial boundaries and names have survived in one form or another down to today, and most Koreans are keenly aware of the regional and dialect distinctions that still exist.

For example, a regional rivalry (akin to that between the Northeast United States and Southern United States) exists between Gyeongsang and Jeolla residents, sites of the ancient kingdoms of Silla and Baekje respectively, due to historic, social, economic, and political differences, some of which have continued into the present day in more muted form. Most of the traditional provinces also had alternative regional names which are still used today (especially Honam, Yeongdong, and Yeongnam), at least in speech, if not on paper.

==Modern-day usage==
The term &quot;Paldo&quot; (&quot;Eight Provinces&quot;) is itself often used as a shorthand to denote Korea as a whole, or to describe the traditional folk culture of Korea&#x27;s regions. Thus, one sometimes finds such expressions as:
*&quot;Paldo kimchi&quot; in reference to the many varieties of kimchi unique to particular regions of Korea;
*&quot;Paldo Arirang&quot; to denote the hundreds of regional versions of the popular folk song &quot;Arirang&quot;; and
*&quot;Paldo sori&quot; to broadly refer to the diversity of folk music (&quot;sori&quot;; &quot;sounds&quot;) across Korea.

Cf. the four Provinces of Ireland—where reference to the ancient provinces is used to talk of the entire island of Ireland.

==Names==
Except Gyeonggi (see note 3 below), each province took its name from the initial Hanja (Sino-Korean characters) of two of its principal cities. The origin of each province&#x27;s name is detailed in the table below.

==Table of provinces==
The table below lists the eight provinces in romanized spelling, Hangul and Hanja; the origin of their names; their capitals, dialects, and regional names; and the 13 provinces that replaced them in 1896. (The capitals and regional names are as of the mid 19th century. Since they were not official, other regional names were also used, but the ones in the table are the most widely used or representative.)

==Notes==
1. Pronounced &quot;Ho-suh,&quot; not &quot;Ho-zay-oh,&quot; as the spelling might suggest.

2. &quot;Gwandong&quot; is the name for the region as a whole, with &quot;Yeongseo&quot; denoting the western half of the province and &quot;Yeongdong&quot; the eastern half. &quot;Yeongdong&quot; is used more often than either of the other two terms, however, especially in reference to railway and road arteries that cross through Gangwon, connecting the Seoul and Yeongdong regions.

3. The province&#x27;s name literally means &quot;area within a 500-&quot;li&quot; (200-km) radius&quot; (&quot;gi&quot;; ) of the &quot;capital&quot; (&quot;Gyeong&quot;; ), referring to the royal capital Hanseong (modern-day Seoul). The regional name &quot;Gijeon&quot; is obsolete. The 20th-century term &quot;Sudogwon&quot; (&quot;Capital Region&quot;) is used today to denote the Seoul-Incheon conurbation and that part of Gyeonggi Province that forms part of the same built-up, urban area.

4. &quot;Kwanbuk&quot; was used to designate either the province as whole, or only the northern part thereof. In the latter case, &quot;Kwannam&quot; was then used to denote the southern part of the province.

5. The modern-day division of the province into North and South did not occur until 1954.

6. The initial &quot;n&quot; in &quot;Naju&quot; is pronounced as &quot;l&quot; (lower-case &quot;L&quot;) when it comes after another consonant; the final &quot;n&quot; in the &quot;Jeon&quot; of &quot;Jeonju&quot; is then assimilated to an &quot;l&quot; sound.

7. The distinctive Jeju Dialect is used on Jeju Island, which became a separate province in 1946.

<text>Kirstie Louise Alley (January 12, 1951 – December 5, 2022) was an American actress. Her breakthrough role was as Rebecca Howe in the NBC sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot; (1987–1993), for which she received an Emmy Award and a Golden Globe in 1991. From 1997 to 2000, Alley starred as the lead in the sitcom &quot;Veronica&#x27;s Closet&quot;, earning additional Emmy and Golden Globe nominations. On film, she played Mollie Jensen in &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking&quot; (1989) and its two sequels, &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking Too&quot; (1990) and &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking Now&quot; (1993).

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Alley appeared in various films, including &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; (1982), &quot;Summer School&quot; (1987), &quot;Shoot to Kill&quot; (1988), &quot;Madhouse&quot; (1990), &quot;Sibling Rivalry&quot; (1990), &quot;Village of the Damned&quot; (1995), &quot;It Takes Two&quot; (1995), &quot;Deconstructing Harry&quot; (1997), &quot;For Richer or Poorer&quot; (1997), and &quot;Drop Dead Gorgeous&quot; (1999).

Alley won her second Emmy Award in 1994 for the television film &quot;David&#x27;s Mother&quot;. In 1997, Alley received another Emmy nomination for her work in the crime drama series &quot;The Last Don&quot;. In 2005, Alley played a fictionalized version of herself on Showtime&#x27;s &quot;Fat Actress&quot;, something she would also do on episodes of &quot;King of Queens&quot; and &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot;, as well as in &quot;Syrup&quot; (2013). In 2013, Alley returned to acting with the title role on the sitcom &quot;Kirstie&quot;. In 2016, she appeared on the Fox comedy horror series &quot;Scream Queens&quot;.

Alley also appeared in reality television including &quot;Kirstie Alley&#x27;s Big Life&quot; (2010) and served as a contestant on the 12th season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; (2011–2012), where she finished in second place, behind Hines Ward, and the 22nd series of the British reality show &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; (2018), in which Alley finished as runner-up. In early 2022, she appeared on &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Alley was born in Wichita, Kansas, on January 12, 1951, to Robert Deal Alley, who owned a lumber company, and Lillian Alley. She had two siblings, Colette and Craig. 

Alley attended Wichita Southeast High School, where she graduated in 1969. She attended college at Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kansas, where she dropped out after completing her sophomore year.

==Career==
After leaving Kansas State, she moved to Los Angeles to pursue Scientology and work as an interior designer. In 1979, she appeared as a contestant on the game show &quot;Match Game&quot;, where she won both her games and went on to win $500 in her first Super Match and $5,500 in her second. In 1980, Alley appeared on the game show &quot;Password Plus&quot;. On both game shows, she described her profession as interior designer. In 1981, an automobile crash involving a drunk driver killed Alley&#x27;s mother and left her father seriously injured.

In 1982, Alley made her film debut in &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; in the role of the Vulcan Starfleet officer Lieutenant Saavik. The Saavik character became very popular with &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans, but Alley chose not to reprise the role in the next two film sequels so the role was recast. 

From 1983 to 1984, she was a regular on the ABC television series &quot;Masquerade&quot;. In the years following, Alley starred in a number of smaller films, including &quot;One More Chance&quot;, &quot;Blind Date&quot; and &quot;Runaway&quot;. 

In 1985, she starred in the ABC miniseries &quot;North and South&quot;, and also portrayed feminist icon Gloria Steinem in the television movie &quot;A Bunny&#x27;s Tale&quot;. In 1987, Alley starred alongside Mark Harmon in the comedy film &quot;Summer School&quot;. The film was a box office success, grossing over $35 million in the United States. She followed up with roles in films such as &quot;Shoot to Kill&quot; (1988), &quot;Madhouse&quot; (1990), and &quot;Sibling Rivalry&quot; (1990).

In 1987, Alley joined the cast of the NBC sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot;, where she played Rebecca Howe. She replaced Shelley Long. Alley remained with the show for six years until its eleventh and final season, and earned an Emmy Award and Golden Globe.

In 1989, she starred with John Travolta in &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking&quot;. The film grossed over $295 million worldwide. They then went on to make two other films centered on the same theme, &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking Too&quot; (1990) and &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking Now&quot; (1993). After two Emmy Award nominations for her work on &quot;Cheers&quot;, in 1988 and 1990, Alley won the Emmy on her third nomination, in 1991. In her acceptance speech, Alley memorably thanked &quot;my husband Parker, the man who has given me the big one for the last eight years.&quot;

Alley earned her second Emmy for the 1994 television film &quot;David&#x27;s Mother&quot;. For her contributions to the film industry, Alley received a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7000 Hollywood Boulevard in 1995. Her later films included &quot;Village of the Damned&quot; (1995), &quot;It Takes Two&quot; (1995), &quot;Deconstructing Harry&quot; (1997), &quot;For Richer or Poorer&quot; (1997), and &quot;Drop Dead Gorgeous&quot; (1999).

From 1997 to 2000, Alley played the title character and was executive producer in the NBC sitcom &quot;Veronica&#x27;s Closet&quot;, where she earned another Emmy and Golden Globe nomination. From 2000 to 2004, she served as a commercial spokesperson for Pier 1 Imports, and for Jenny Craig from 2004 to 2007. In 2005, Alley played a fictionalized version of herself on the show &quot;Fat Actress&quot;. In 2010, she was in the reality show &quot;Kirstie Alley&#x27;s Big Life&quot;. From 2011 to 2012, Alley appeared as a contestant on seasons 12 and 15 of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, partnering with Maksim Chmerkovskiy.

Beginning in December 2013, TV Land aired a sitcom that centered on Alley as Broadway star Madison &quot;Maddie&quot; Banks, who reconnects with her adult son who she gave up for adoption shortly after he was born. The series was titled &quot;Kirstie&quot;, and reunited her with former &quot;Cheers&quot; co-star Rhea Perlman and &quot;Seinfeld&quot; star Michael Richards. The series ran for five months.

In 2018, Alley appeared on season 22 of the British series &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;; she finished in second place.

In 2019, Alley returned to the game show &quot;Match Game&quot;, where she was a contestant in 1979, this time as a celebrity panel. Host Alec Baldwin surprised Alley with a clip from the original series. This made her only the second former contestant to return as a panelist. (The first was actress Brianne Leary, who was a contestant in 1976 and a panelist in 1979.)

In 2022, Alley competed in season seven of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Baby Mammoth&quot; of Team Cuddly.

==Personal life==
Alley was married from 1971 to 1977 to her high school sweetheart Robert (Bob) Alley, who coincidentally had the same name as her father. Alley married actor Parker Stevenson on December 22, 1983. After a miscarriage, the couple adopted their first child, a son, in October 1992, and in 1995, they adopted their second child, a girl. The marriage ended in 1997. In 2016, Alley became a grandmother through her son.

In 1988 and 2000 respectively, Alley purchased estates in Jacksonville, Oregon, and Clearwater, Florida, retaining ownership of both properties until her death in 2022. From 1991 to 2020, Alley also resided on Islesboro Island, Maine. She once owned the Mitchell Cottage, formerly the Islesboro Inn, with her then husband Stevenson.

===Body image===
On &quot;The Dr. Oz Show&quot; on September 17, 2012, Alley said she started gaining weight in late 2003, and that she had been a compulsive eater all her life without gaining weight, only noticing the change after she reached early menopause in 1992.

While working as a Jenny Craig spokesperson from 2004 to 2007, Alley lost , bringing her weight down to .

In May 2009, Alley told &quot;People&quot; magazine that, after parting ways with Jenny Craig, she gained and weighed as much as .

In March 2010, after gossip blogger Roger Friedman alleged a link between her Organic Liaison weight-loss system and the Church of Scientology, Alley denied it on the &quot;Today&quot; show. In September 2011, Alley announced that she had lost using weight loss products from Organic Liaison. In 2012, Alley faced a class-action lawsuit alleging false advertising; the suit claimed that her weight loss was the result of exercise, including training for the TV show &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, not Organic Liaison products. Alley settled the suit in 2013, agreeing to remove the term &quot;Proven Products&quot; from packaging, issue a disclaimer on the brand&#x27;s website that it is a &quot;calorie-based weight-loss product&quot;, and pay a $130,000 settlement.

In April 2014, Alley resumed a role as a spokesperson with Jenny Craig; the Organic Liaison product line was acquired by Jenny Craig&#x27;s parent company, and subsequently integrated into Jenny Craig&#x27;s product line. In January 2015, Alley said that, since starting the Jenny Craig weight-loss program again, she had lost .

===Scientology===
Alley was raised as a Methodist; she became a member of the Church of Scientology in 1979. Alley said that until she became a Scientologist she was addicted to cocaine but then went through Narconon, a Scientology-affiliated drug treatment program to end her addiction. By 2007, Alley attained the level of OT VII (Operating Thetan Level 7), and by 2018, she was New OT VIII. In January 2008, Alley said, &quot;Scientology made me a lot stronger and tougher...It&#x27;s made me more honest and more willing to take responsibility for other people.&quot; Alley gave $5 million to the church in 2007.

Due to her commitment to the Church of Scientology, Alley decided not to reprise her role as Rebecca Howe on any episode of the &quot;Cheers&quot; spinoff &quot;Frasier&quot;, because the series was centered on the field of medical psychiatry, with different ideas from those of the Church; Alley was the only former &quot;Cheers&quot; regular not to do so.

===Politics===
Alley said she supported both Democratic and Republican presidential nominees and independent Ross Perot in 1992, but decided not to vote in 1988 and 2004. In August 2015, Alley tweeted that she would not support Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, during the 2016 presidential election, and on April 8, 2016, Alley tweeted her support for Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani. On October 8, 2016, Alley retracted her endorsement of Trump, tweeting, &quot;I hate this election and I&#x27;m officially no longer endorsing either candidate.&quot;

In October 2020, after saying that she voted for Trump four years ago, Alley intended to vote for him again in 2020 because &quot;he&#x27;s NOT a politician.&quot;
Alley endorsed Republican John James in the 2020 U.S. Senate election in Michigan.

==Death==
In May 2022, Alley was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer, following a doctor’s visit for a sore, and subsequently underwent chemotherapy treatments at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida. She died at her home in Clearwater, Florida seven months later on December 5 at the age of 71.

Alley&#x27;s ex-husband Parker Stevenson, her two children, her &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking&quot; co-star John Travolta, and other celebrities posted their condolences on social media. Her &quot;Cheers&quot; co-stars Ted Danson, Kelsey Grammer, and Rhea Perlman released statements memorializing her.

Alley&#x27;s work was honored by multiple associations throughout her career. For her role in the sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot;, she earned four Golden Globe Award nominations, winning once for Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy in 1991; and five Primetime Emmy Award nominations, winning one for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series in 1991. She won an additional Emmy for her role in the television film, &quot;David&#x27;s Mother&quot; (1994).

On November 10, 1995, Alley was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contributions to motion pictures.

<text>The glaucous gull (Larus hyperboreus) is a large gull, the second-largest gull in the world. The genus name is from Latin , which appears to have referred to a gull or other large seabird. The specific name is Latin for &quot;northern&quot; from the Ancient Greek &quot;Huperboreoi&quot; people from the far north &quot;Glaucous&quot; is from Latin and denotes the grey colour of the gull. An older English name for this species is burgomaster.

==Distribution==
This gull breeds in Arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere and winters south to shores of the Holarctic.It is migratory, wintering from in the North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans as far south as the British Isles and northernmost states of the United States, also on the Great Lakes. A few birds sometimes reach the southern USA and northern Mexico.

==Description==
This is a large and powerful gull, second-largest of all gull species and very pale in all plumage, with no black on either the wings or the tail. Adults are pale grey above, with a thick, yellow bill. Juveniles are very pale grey with a pink and black bill. This species is considerably larger, bulkier, and thicker-billed than the similar Iceland gull, and can sometimes equal the size of the great black-backed gull, the oft-titled largest gull species. In some areas, glaucous gulls are about the same weight as great black-backed gulls or even heavier, and their maximum weight is greater. They can weigh from , with the sexes previously reported to average in males and in females. At the colony on Coats Island in Canada, the gulls are nearly 15% heavier than some other known populations, with a mean weight in five males and in seven females. One other study claimed even higher weights for glaucous gulls, as on Wrangel Island, 9 males reportedly averaged and in six females, which if accurate, would make the glaucous gull the heaviest gull and shorebird in the world if not (as far as is known) the largest in length on average. These gulls range from in length and can span , with some specimens possibly attaining , across the wings. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the bill is and the tarsus is . They take four years to reach maturity.

The call is a &quot;laughing&quot; cry similar to that of the herring gull, but deeper.

==Subspecies==
The four recognized subspecies are:
==Ecology==
This species of seagull breeds colonially or singly on coasts and cliffs, making a lined nest on the ground or cliff. Normally, two to four light brown eggs with dark brown splotches are laid.

These are omnivores like most &quot;Larus&quot; gulls, and they eat fish, insects, molluscs, starfish, offal, scraps, eggs, small birds, small mammals, and carrion, as well as seeds, berries, and grains.

<text>Some philosophers distinguish two types of rights, natural rights and legal rights.
* Natural rights are those that are not dependent on the laws or customs of any particular culture or government, and so are &quot;universal&quot;, &quot;fundamental&quot; and &quot;inalienable&quot; (they cannot be repealed by human laws, though one can forfeit their enjoyment through one&#x27;s actions, such as by violating someone else&#x27;s rights). Natural law is the law of natural rights.
* Legal rights are those bestowed onto a person by a given legal system (they can be modified, repealed, and restrained by human laws). The concept of positive law is related to the concept of legal rights.

Natural law first appeared in ancient Greek philosophy, and was referred to by Roman philosopher Cicero. It was subsequently alluded to in the Bible, and then developed in the Middle Ages by Catholic philosophers such as Albert the Great, his pupil Thomas Aquinas, and Jean Gerson in his 1402 work &quot;De Vita Spirituali Animae.&quot; During the Age of Enlightenment, the concept of natural laws was used to challenge the divine right of kings, and became an alternative justification for the establishment of a social contract, positive law, and government – and thus legal rights – in the form of classical republicanism. Conversely, the concept of natural rights is used by others to challenge the legitimacy of all such establishments.

The idea of human rights derives from theories of natural rights. Those rejecting a distinction between human rights and natural rights view human rights as the successor that is not dependent on natural law, natural theology, or Christian theological doctrine. Natural rights, in particular, are considered beyond the authority of any government or international body to dismiss. The 1948 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights is an important legal instrument enshrining one conception of natural rights into international soft law. Natural rights were traditionally viewed as exclusively negative rights, whereas human rights also comprise positive rights. Even on a natural rights conception of human rights, the two terms may not be synonymous.

The concept of natural rights is not universally accepted, partly due to its religious associations and perceived incoherence. Some philosophers argue that natural rights do not exist and that legal rights are the only rights; for instance, Jeremy Bentham called natural rights &quot;simple nonsense&quot;. Iusnaturalism, particularly, holds that legal norms follow a human universal knowledge. Thus, it views enacted laws that contradict such universal knowledge as unjust and illegitimate, but some jusnaturalists might attribute the source of natural law to a natural order instead of a divine mandate.

==History==
The idea that certain rights are natural or inalienable also has a history dating back at least to the Stoics of late Antiquity, through Catholic law of the early Middle Ages, and descending through the Protestant Reformation and the Age of Enlightenment to today.

The existence of natural rights has been asserted by different individuals on different premises, such as &quot;a priori&quot; philosophical reasoning or religious principles. For example, Immanuel Kant claimed to derive natural rights through reason alone. The United States Declaration of Independence, meanwhile, is based upon the &quot;self-evident&quot; truth that &quot;all men are ... endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights&quot;.

Likewise, different philosophers and statesmen have designed different lists of what they believe to be natural rights; almost all include the right to life and liberty as the two highest priorities. H. L. A. Hart argued that if there are any rights at all, there must be the right to liberty, for all the others would depend upon this. T. H. Green argued that &quot;if there are such things as rights at all, then, there must be a right to life and liberty, or, to put it more properly to free life.&quot; John Locke emphasized &quot;life, liberty and property&quot; as primary. However, despite Locke&#x27;s influential defense of the right of revolution, Thomas Jefferson substituted &quot;pursuit of happiness&quot; in place of &quot;property&quot; in the United States Declaration of Independence.

===Ancient===
Stephen Kinzer, a veteran journalist for &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the author of the book &quot;All The Shah&#x27;s Men&quot;, writes in the latter that:

The 40 Principal Doctrines of the Epicureans taught that &quot;in order to obtain protection from other men, any means for attaining this end is a natural good&quot; (PD 6). They believed in a contractarian ethics where mortals agree to not harm or be harmed, and the rules that govern their agreements are not absolute (PD 33), but must change with circumstances (PD 37–38). The Epicurean doctrines imply that humans in their natural state enjoy personal sovereignty and that they must consent to the laws that govern them, and that this consent (and the laws) can be revisited periodically when circumstances change.

The Stoics held that no one was a slave by nature; slavery was an external condition juxtaposed to the internal freedom of the soul (&quot;sui juris&quot;). Seneca the Younger wrote:

Of fundamental importance to the development of the idea of natural rights was the emergence of the idea of natural human equality. As the historian A.J. Carlyle notes: &quot;There is no change in political theory so startling in its completeness as the change from the theory of Aristotle to the later philosophical view represented by Cicero and Seneca. ... We think that this cannot be better exemplified than with regard to the theory of the equality of human nature.&quot; Charles H. McIlwain likewise observes that &quot;the idea of the equality of men is the profoundest contribution of the Stoics to political thought&quot; and that &quot;its greatest influence is in the changed conception of law that in part resulted from it.&quot; Cicero argues in De Legibus that &quot;we are born for Justice, and that right is based, not upon opinions, but upon Nature.&quot;

===Modern===
One of the first Western thinkers to develop the contemporary idea of natural rights was French theologian Jean Gerson, whose 1402 treatise &quot;De Vita Spirituali Animae&quot; is considered one of the first attempts to develop what would come to be called modern natural rights theory.

The Polish-Lithuanian union made a natural rights case at the Council of Constance (1414–1418), led by Paulus Vladimiri, rector of the Jagiellonian University. He challenged legality of the Teutonic Order&#x27;s crusade against Lithuania, arguing that the Order could only wage a defensive war if pagans violated the natural rights of the Christians. Vladimiri further stipulated that infidels had rights which had to be respected, and neither the Pope nor the Holy Roman Emperor had the authority to violate them. Lithuanians also brought a group of Samogitian representatives to testify to atrocities committed by the Order.

The Stoic doctrine that the &quot;inner part cannot be delivered into bondage&quot; re-emerged centuries later in the Reformation doctrine of liberty of conscience. In 1523, Martin Luther wrote:

17th-century English philosopher John Locke discussed natural rights in his work, identifying them as being &quot;life, liberty, and estate (property)&quot;, and argued that such fundamental rights could not be surrendered in the social contract. Preservation of the natural rights to life, liberty, and property was claimed as justification for the rebellion of the American colonies. As George Mason stated in his draft for the &quot;Virginia Declaration of Rights&quot;, &quot;all men are born equally free&quot;, and hold &quot;certain inherent natural rights, of which they cannot, by any compact, deprive or divest their posterity.&quot; Another 17th-century Englishman, John Lilburne (known as &quot;Freeborn John&quot;), who came into conflict with both the monarchy of King Charles I and the military dictatorship of Oliver Cromwell, argued for level human basic rights he called &quot;freeborn rights&quot; which he defined as being rights that every human being is born with, as opposed to rights bestowed by government or by human law.

The distinction between alienable and unalienable rights was introduced by Francis Hutcheson. In his &quot;Inquiry into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue&quot; (1725), Hutcheson foreshadowed the Declaration of Independence, stating: &quot;For wherever any Invasion is made upon unalienable Rights, there must arise either a perfect, or external Right to Resistance. ... Unalienable Rights are essential Limitations in all Governments.&quot; Hutcheson, however, placed clear limits on his notion of unalienable rights, declaring that &quot;there can be no Right, or Limitation of Right, inconsistent with, or opposite to the greatest public Good.&quot; Hutcheson elaborated on this idea of unalienable rights in his &quot;A System of Moral Philosophy&quot; (1755), based on the Reformation principle of the liberty of conscience. One could not in fact give up the capacity for private judgment (e.g., about religious questions) regardless of any external contracts or oaths to religious or secular authorities so that right is &quot;unalienable&quot;. Hutcheson wrote: &quot;Thus no man can really change his sentiments, judgments, and inward affections, at the pleasure of another; nor can it tend to any good to make him profess what is contrary to his heart. The right of private judgment is therefore unalienable.&quot;

In the German Enlightenment, Hegel gave a highly developed treatment of this inalienability argument. Like Hutcheson, Hegel based the theory of inalienable rights on the &quot;de facto&quot; inalienability of those aspects of personhood that distinguish persons from things. A thing, like a piece of property, can in fact be transferred from one person to another. According to Hegel, the same would not apply to those aspects that make one a person:

In discussion of social contract theory, &quot;inalienable rights&quot; were said to be those rights that could not be surrendered by citizens to the sovereign. Such rights were thought to be &quot;natural rights&quot;, independent of positive law. Some social contract theorists reasoned, however, that in the natural state only the strongest could benefit from their rights. Thus, people form an implicit social contract, ceding their natural rights to the authority to protect the people from abuse, and living henceforth under the legal rights of that authority.

Many historical apologies for slavery and illiberal government were based on explicit or implicit voluntary contracts to alienate any &quot;natural rights&quot; to freedom and self-determination. The &quot;de facto&quot; inalienability arguments of Hutcheson and his predecessors provided the basis for the anti-slavery movement to argue not simply against involuntary slavery but against any explicit or implied contractual forms of slavery. Any contract that tried to legally alienate such a right would be inherently invalid. Similarly, the argument was used by the democratic movement to argue against any explicit or implied social contracts of subjection (&quot;pactum subjectionis&quot;) by which a people would supposedly alienate their right of self-government to a sovereign as, for example, in &quot;Leviathan&quot; by Thomas Hobbes. According to Ernst Cassirer,

These themes converged in the debate about American independence. While Jefferson was writing the Declaration of Independence, Welsh nonconformist Richard Price sided with the colonists&#x27; claim that King George III was &quot;attempting to rob them of that liberty to which every member of society and all civil communities have a natural and unalienable title.&quot; Price again based the argument on the &quot;de facto&quot; inalienability of &quot;that principle of spontaneity or self-determination which constitutes us agents or which gives us a command over our actions, rendering them properly ours, and not effects of the operation of any foreign cause.&quot; Any social contract or compact allegedly alienating these rights would be non-binding and void, wrote Price:

Price raised a furor of opposition so in 1777 he wrote another tract that clarified his position and again restated the &quot;de facto&quot; basis for the argument that the &quot;liberty of men as agents is that power of self-determination which all agents, as such, possess.&quot;
In &quot;Intellectual Origins of American Radicalism&quot;, Staughton Lynd pulled together these themes and related them to the slavery debate:

Meanwhile, in America, Thomas Jefferson &quot;took his division of rights into alienable and unalienable from Hutcheson, who made the distinction popular and important&quot;, and in the 1776 United States Declaration of Independence, famously condensed this to:

In the 19th century, the movement to abolish slavery seized this passage as a statement of constitutional principle, although the U.S. constitution recognized and protected the institution of slavery. As a lawyer, future Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase argued before the Supreme Court in the case of John Van Zandt, who had been charged with violating the Fugitive Slave Act, that:

The concept of inalienable rights was criticized by Jeremy Bentham and Edmund Burke as groundless. Bentham and Burke claimed that rights arise from the actions of government, or evolve from tradition, and that neither of these can provide anything &quot;inalienable&quot;. (See Bentham&#x27;s &quot;Critique of the Doctrine of Inalienable, Natural Rights&quot;, and Burke&#x27;s &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot;). Presaging the shift in thinking in the 19th century, Bentham famously dismissed the idea of natural rights as &quot;nonsense on stilts&quot;. By way of contrast to the views of Burke and Bentham, Patriot scholar and justice James Wilson criticized Burke&#x27;s view as &quot;tyranny&quot;.

The signers of the Declaration of Independence deemed it a &quot;self-evident truth&quot; that all men &quot;are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights&quot;.
In &quot;The Social Contract&quot;, Jean-Jacques Rousseau claims that the existence of inalienable rights is unnecessary for the existence of a constitution or a set of laws and rights. This idea of a social contractthat rights and responsibilities are derived from a consensual contract between the government and the peopleis the most widely recognized alternative.

One criticism of natural rights theory is that one cannot draw norms from facts. This objection is variously expressed as the is-ought problem, the naturalistic fallacy, or the appeal to nature. G.E. Moore, for example, said that ethical naturalism falls prey to the naturalistic fallacy. Some defenders of natural rights theory, however, counter that the term &quot;natural&quot; in &quot;natural rights&quot; is contrasted with &quot;artificial&quot; rather than referring to nature. John Finnis, for example, contends that natural law and natural rights are derived from self-evident principles, not from speculative principles or from facts.

There is also debate as to whether all rights are either natural or legal. Fourth president of the United States James Madison, while representing Virginia in the House of Representatives, believed that there are rights, such as trial by jury, that are social rights, arising neither from natural law nor from positive law (which are the basis of natural and legal rights respectively) but from the social contract from which a government derives its authority.

====Thomas Hobbes====


Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679) included a discussion of natural rights in his moral and political philosophy. Hobbes&#x27; conception of natural rights extended from his conception of man in a &quot;state of nature&quot;. Thus he argued that the essential natural (human) right was &quot;to use his own power, as he will himself, for the preservation of his own Nature; that is to say, of his own Life; and consequently, of doing any thing, which in his own judgement, and Reason, he shall conceive to be the aptest means thereunto.&quot; (&quot;Leviathan&quot;. 1, XIV)

Hobbes sharply distinguished this natural &quot;liberty&quot;, from natural &quot;laws&quot;, described generally as &quot;a precept, or general rule, found out by reason, by which a man is forbidden to do, that, which is destructive of his life, or taketh away the means of preserving his life; and to omit, that, by which he thinketh it may best be preserved.&quot; (&quot;Leviathan&quot;. 1, XIV)

In his natural state, according to Hobbes, man&#x27;s life consisted entirely of liberties and not at all of laws – &quot;It followeth, that in such a condition, every man has the right to every thing; even to one another&#x27;s body. And therefore, as long as this natural Right of every man to every thing endureth, there can be no security to any man... of living out the time, which Nature ordinarily allow men to live.&quot; (&quot;Leviathan&quot;. 1, XIV)

This would lead inevitably to a situation known as the &quot;war of all against all&quot;, in which human beings kill, steal and enslave others to stay alive, and due to their natural lust for &quot;Gain&quot;, &quot;Safety&quot; and &quot;Reputation&quot;. Hobbes reasoned that this world of chaos created by unlimited rights was highly undesirable, since it would cause human life to be &quot;solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short&quot;. As such, if humans wish to live peacefully they must give up most of their natural rights and create moral obligations to establish political and civil society. This is one of the earliest formulations of the theory of government known as the social contract.

Hobbes objected to the attempt to derive rights from &quot;natural law&quot;, arguing that law (&quot;lex&quot;) and right (&quot;jus&quot;) though often confused, signify opposites, with law referring to obligations, while rights refer to the absence of obligations. Since by our (human) nature, we seek to maximize our well being, rights are prior to law, natural or institutional, and people will not follow the laws of nature without first being subjected to a sovereign power, without which all ideas of right and wrong are meaningless – &quot;Therefore before the names of Just and Unjust can have place, there must be some coercive Power, to compel men equally to the performance of their Covenants..., to make good that Propriety, which by mutual contract men acquire, in recompense of the universal Right they abandon: and such power there is none before the erection of the Commonwealth.&quot; (&quot;Leviathan&quot;&quot;. 1, XV)

This marked an important departure from medieval natural law theories which gave precedence to obligations over rights.
====John Locke====
John Locke (1632–1704) was another prominent Western philosopher who conceptualized rights as natural and inalienable. Like Hobbes, Locke believed in a natural right to life, liberty, and property. It was once conventional wisdom that Locke greatly influenced the American Revolution with his writings of natural rights, but this claim has been the subject of protracted dispute in recent decades. For example, the historian Ray Forrest Harvey declared that Jefferson and Locke were at &quot;two opposite poles&quot; in their political philosophy, as evidenced by Jefferson&#x27;s use in the Declaration of Independence of the phrase &quot;pursuit of happiness&quot; instead of &quot;property&quot;. More recently, the eminent legal historian John Phillip Reid has deplored contemporary scholars&#x27; &quot;misplaced emphasis on John Locke&quot;, arguing that American revolutionary leaders saw Locke as a &quot;commentator&quot; on established constitutional principles. Thomas Pangle has defended Locke&#x27;s influence on the Founding, claiming that historians who argue to the contrary either misrepresent the classical republican alternative to which they say the revolutionary leaders adhered, do not understand Locke, or point to someone else who was decisively influenced by Locke. This position has also been sustained by Michael Zuckert.

According to Locke, there are three natural rights:
* Life: everyone is entitled to live.
* Liberty: everyone is entitled to do anything they want to so long as it does not conflict with the first right.
* Estate: everyone is entitled to own all they create or gain through gift or trade so long as it does not conflict with the first two rights.

In developing his concept of natural rights, Locke was influenced by reports of society among Native Americans, whom he regarded as natural peoples who lived in a &quot;state of liberty&quot; and perfect freedom, but &quot;not a state of license&quot;. It also informed his conception of social contract. Although he does not blatantly state it, his position implies that even in light of our unique characteristics we should not be treated differently by our neighbors or our rulers. &quot;Locke is arguing that there is no natural characteristic sufficient to distinguish one person from another... of, course there are plenty of natural differences between us&quot; (Haworth 103). What Haworth takes from Locke is that John Locke was obsessed with supporting equality in society, treating everyone as an equal. He does though highlight our differences with his philosophy showing that we are all unique and important to society. In his philosophy, it is highlighted that the ideal government should also protect everyone, and provide rights and freedom to everyone, because we are all important to society. His ideas then were developed into the movements for freedom from the British creating our government. However, his implied thought of freedom for all is applied most heavily in our culture today. Starting with the civil rights movement, and continuing through women&#x27;s rights, Locke&#x27;s call for a fair government can be seen as the influence in these movements. His ideas are typically just seen as the foundation for modern democracy; however, it is not unreasonable to credit Locke with the social activism throughout the history of America.

By founding this sense of freedom for all, Locke was laying the groundwork for the equality that occurs today. Despite the apparent misuse of his philosophy in early American democracy. The Civil Rights movement and the suffrage movement both called out the state of American democracy during their challenges to the government&#x27;s view on equality. To them it was clear that when the designers of democracy said all, they meant all people shall receive those natural rights that John Locke cherished so deeply. &quot;a state also of equality, wherein all the power and jurisdiction is reciprocal, no one having more than another&quot; (Locke II,4). Locke in his papers on natural philosophy clearly states that he wants a government where all are treated equal in freedoms especially. &quot;Locke&#x27;s views on toleration were very progressive for the time&quot; (Connolly). Authors such as Jacob Connolly confirm that to them Locke was highly ahead of his time with all this progressive thinking. That is that his thought fits our current state of democracy where we strive to make sure that everyone has a say in the government, and everyone has a chance at a good life. Regardless of race, gender, or social standing starting with Locke it was made clear not only that the government should provide rights, but rights to everyone through his social contract.

The social contract is an agreement between members of a country to live within a shared system of laws. Specific forms of government are the result of the decisions made by these persons acting in their collective capacity. Government is instituted to make laws that protect the three natural rights. If a government does not properly protect these rights, it can be overthrown.
====Thomas Paine====

Thomas Paine (1731–1809) further elaborated on natural rights in his influential work &quot;Rights of Man&quot; (1791), emphasizing that rights cannot be granted by any charter because this would legally imply they can also be revoked and under such circumstances, they would be reduced to privileges:


=== American individualist anarchists ===
While at first American individualist anarchists adhered to natural rights positions, later in this era led by Benjamin Tucker, some abandoned natural rights positions and converted to Max Stirner&#x27;s Egoist anarchism. Rejecting the idea of moral rights, Tucker said there were only two rights: &quot;the right of might&quot; and &quot;the right of contract&quot;. He also said, after converting to Egoist individualism, &quot;In times past... it was my habit to talk glibly of the right of man to land. It was a bad habit, and I long ago sloughed it off. ... Man&#x27;s only right to land is his might over it.&quot;

According to Wendy McElroy:
Several periodicals were &quot;undoubtedly influenced by &quot;Liberty&quot;&#x27;s presentation of egoism, including &quot;I&quot; published by C.L. Swartz, edited by W.E. Gordak and J.W. Lloyd (all associates of &quot;Liberty&quot;); &quot;The Ego&quot; and &quot;The Egoist&quot;, both of which were edited by Edward H. Fulton. Among the egoist papers that Tucker followed were the German &quot;Der Eigene&quot;, edited by Adolf Brand, and &quot;The Eagle&quot; and &quot;The Serpent&quot;, issued from London. The latter, the most prominent English-language egoist journal, was published from 1898 to 1900 with the subtitle &#x27;A Journal of Egoistic Philosophy and Sociology. Among those American anarchists who adhered to egoism include Benjamin Tucker, John Beverley Robinson, Steven T. Byington, Hutchins Hapgood, James L. Walker, Victor Yarros and E.H. Fulton.

==Contemporary==
Many documents now echo the phrase used in the United States Declaration of Independence. The preamble to the 1948 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights asserts that rights are inalienable: &quot;recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.&quot; Article 1, § 1 of the California Constitution recognizes inalienable rights and articulated &quot;some&quot; (not all) of those rights as &quot;defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining safety, happiness, and privacy.&quot; However, there is still much dispute over which &quot;rights&quot; are truly natural rights and which are not, and the concept of natural or inalienable rights is still controversial to some.

Erich Fromm argued that some powers over human beings could be wielded only by God, and that if there were no God, no human beings could wield these powers.

Contemporary political philosophies continuing the classical liberal tradition of natural rights include libertarianism, anarcho-capitalism and Objectivism, and include amongst their canon the works of authors such as Robert Nozick, Ayn Rand and Murray Rothbard. A libertarian view of inalienable rights is laid out in Morris and Linda Tannehill&#x27;s &quot;The Market for Liberty&quot;, which claims that a man has a right to ownership over his life and therefore also his property, because he has invested time (i.e. part of his life) in it and thereby made it an extension of his life. However, if he initiates force against and to the detriment of another man, he alienates himself from the right to that part of his life which is required to pay his debt: &quot;Rights are &quot;not&quot; inalienable, but only the possessor of a right can alienate himself from that right – no one else can take a man&#x27;s rights from him.&quot;

Various definitions of inalienability include non-relinquishability, non-salability, and non-transferability. This concept has been recognized by libertarians as being central to the question of voluntary slavery, which Murray Rothbard dismissed as illegitimate and even self-contradictory. Stephan Kinsella argues that &quot;viewing rights as alienable is perfectly consistent with – indeed, implied by – the libertarian non-aggression principle. Under this principle, only the initiation of force is prohibited; defensive, restitutive, or retaliatory force is not.&quot;

Various philosophers have created different lists of rights they consider to be natural. Proponents of natural rights, in particular Hesselberg and Rothbard, have responded that reason can be applied to separate truly axiomatic rights from supposed rights, stating that any principle that requires itself to be disproved is an axiom. Critics have pointed to the lack of agreement between the proponents as evidence for the claim that the idea of natural rights is merely a political tool.

Hugh Gibbons has proposed a descriptive argument based on human biology. His contention is that human beings were other-regarding as a matter of necessity, to avoid the costs of conflict. Over time they developed expectations that individuals would act in certain ways which were then prescribed by society (duties of care etc.) and that eventually crystallized into actionable rights.

=== Catholic Church ===
The Catholic Church considers natural law a dogma. The Church considers that: &quot;The natural law expresses the original moral sense which enables man to discern by reason the good and the evil, the truth and the lie: &#x27;The natural law is written and engraved in the soul of each and every man, because it is human reason ordaining him to do good and forbidding him to sin . . . But this command of human reason would not have the force of law if it were not the voice and interpreter of a higher reason to which our spirit and our freedom must be submitted. The natural law consists, for the Catholic Church, of one supreme and universal principle from which are derived all our natural moral obligations or duties. Thomas Aquinas resumes the various ideas of Catholic moral thinkers about what this principle is: since good is what primarily falls under the apprehension of the practical reason, the supreme principle of moral action must have the good as its central idea, and therefore the supreme principle is that good is to be done and evil avoided.

<text>Thomas Spencer Monson (August 21, 1927 – January 2, 2018) was an American religious leader, author, and the 16th president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). As president, he was considered by adherents of the religion to be a prophet, seer, and revelator. Monson&#x27;s early career was as a manager at the &quot;Deseret News&quot;, a Utah newspaper owned by the LDS Church. He spent most of his life engaged in various church leadership positions and public service.

Monson was ordained an LDS apostle at age 36, served in the First Presidency under three church presidents, and was the President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles from March 12, 1995, until he became President of the Church on February 3, 2008. He succeeded Gordon B. Hinckley as church president.

Monson received four honorary doctorate degrees, as well as the Boy Scouts of America&#x27;s Silver Buffalo and the World Organization of the Scout Movement&#x27;s Bronze Wolf—the highest awards in each organization. He was a member of the National Executive Board of the Boy Scouts of America, the organization&#x27;s governing body.

Monson was chairman of the Boards of Trustees/Education of the Church Educational System, and Ronald Reagan appointed him to the U.S. President&#x27;s Task Force for Private Sector Initiatives. He married Frances Beverly Johnson in the Salt Lake Temple in 1948, and together they raised their three children. Frances died on May 17, 2013.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Monson was born on August 21, 1927, at St. Mark&#x27;s Hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah, the son of George Spencer Monson and Gladys Condie Monson. The second of six children, Monson grew up in a &quot;tight-knit&quot; family, with many of his mother&#x27;s relatives living on the same street and the extended family frequently vacationing together. The family&#x27;s neighborhood included several residents of Mexican descent, an environment in which Monson said he developed a love for the Mexican people and culture. Monson often spent weekends with relatives on their farms in Granger (now part of West Valley City), and as a teenager, he worked at a printing business his father managed.

From 1940 to 1944, Monson attended West High School in Salt Lake City. In the fall of 1944, he enrolled at the University of Utah. Around this time he met his future wife, Frances, whose family came from a higher social class on the east side of the city. Her father, Franz Johnson, saw an immediate connection because Monson&#x27;s great uncle, Elias Monson, had baptized him into the LDS Church in Sweden.

=== Early career ===
In 1945, Monson joined the United States Naval Reserve and anticipated participating in World War II in the Pacific theater. He was sent to San Diego, California, for training, but was not stationed overseas before the end of the war. His tour of duty lasted six months beyond the end of the war, then he returned to the University of Utah. Monson graduated in 1948 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree &quot;cum laude&quot; in business management. Monson did not serve a mission as a youth. At age 21, on October 7, 1948, he married Frances Beverly Johnson in the Salt Lake Temple. The couple eventually had three children: Thomas Lee, Ann Frances, and Clark Spencer.

After college he rejoined the Naval Reserve with the aim of becoming an officer. Shortly after receiving his commission acceptance letter, his local bishop asked him to serve as a counselor in the bishopric. Time conflicts with bishopric meetings would have made Navy service impossible. After discussion with church apostle Harold B. Lee (his former stake president), Monson declined the commission and applied for a discharge. The Navy granted his discharge in the last group processed before the Korean War. Lee set him apart six months later as a bishop—mentioning in the blessing that he likely would not have been called if he had accepted the commission.

Monson briefly taught at the University of Utah, then began a career in publishing. His first job was with the &quot;Deseret News&quot;, where he became an advertising executive. He joined the advertising operations at the Newspaper Agency Corporation at its formation in 1952. One year later, Monson transferred to the Deseret News Press, beginning as sales manager and eventually becoming general manager. While at Deseret News Press, Monson worked to publish LeGrand Richards&#x27;s &quot;A Marvelous Work And A Wonder&quot;. He also worked with Gordon B. Hinckley, the LDS Church&#x27;s representative on publications, with whom he would later serve in the First Presidency. In addition to serving as a counselor to President Hinckley, President Monson also served alongside two other church presidents.

===Local church leadership===
On May 7, 1950, Monson became an LDS bishop at age 22, serving for five years in two wards. He had previously served as ward clerk, ward Young Men&#x27;s Mutual Improvement Association superintendent. At the time, Monson&#x27;s Salt Lake City ward contained over 1,000 people, including 85 widows whom he visited regularly, and he continued visiting these widows after completing his service as bishop. He brought them gifts during the Christmas season, including poultry he had raised himself. Monson eventually spoke at the funerals of each of these women. Also during his time as bishop, 23 men from his ward served in the Korean War. He wrote weekly personal letters to each serviceman. During his service as bishop of the 6th-7th Ward, sacrament meeting attendance in the ward quadrupled.

On June 16, 1955, at age 27, Monson became a counselor to Percy K. Fetzer in the presidency of the Salt Lake Temple View Stake. He was replaced as bishop of the 6th-7th ward the following month. In the stake presidency, Monson oversaw the stake&#x27;s Primary, Sunday School, MIA, athletics and budget, until he was moved to Holladay, Utah, in June 1957. In Holladay, Monson was assigned to a ward building committee, to coordinate ward members&#x27; volunteer service to build a meetinghouse.

=== Mission president in Canada ===
In April 1959, at age 31, Monson became president of the church&#x27;s Canadian Mission (consisting of Ontario and Quebec), and served until January 1962. Monson&#x27;s third child, Clark, was born during his mission presidency.

As there were no local stakes in Ontario or Quebec at the time, Monson was responsible for both the missionaries and all LDS Church operations in the area. When he became mission president, he oversaw 130 missionaries and 55 church branches divided into nine districts. During his tenure, the number of missionaries peaked at 180. Historically, most districts and branches in the area had been presided over by full-time missionaries, but Monson placed local members as presidents of branches and districts soon after arriving.

Monson initiated French-speaking proselytizing efforts in Quebec. He directed increased missionary work to immigrants from the Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Italy, Soviet Union and Hungary. Jacob de Jager, a future LDS general authority, was among the immigrant converts. Monson encouraged members to remain in eastern Canada, instead of migrating to Utah or Alberta as many members had done before, to help build the church&#x27;s presence. To help encourage members to stay in Canada, increase the perception of permanence, and better reach potential converts, he started a major construction program for new meetinghouses. Until then, most branches had used rented halls.

Efforts made during Monson&#x27;s service came to fruition when a stake was organized in Toronto on August 14, 1960. However, most of the mission&#x27;s area remained in districts. A more complete presence in Ontario would not come until the dedication of the Toronto Ontario Temple in 1990, which Monson attended as a member of the First Presidency.

=== Return to Utah ===
Immediately after returning from Canada, Monson was called to the high council of the Valley View Stake in Holladay. Two months later he was made area supervisor over nine stake missions (Winder, Wilford, Monument Park, Monument Park West, Hillside, Highland, Parleys, Sugarhouse, and Wasatch). Eight of these stakes were in Salt Lake City or its east-side suburbs, with the Wasatch Stake based in Heber City. He also joined the church&#x27;s Priesthood Genealogy Committee, and later the Priesthood Home Teaching Committee.

Monson resumed his work with the &quot;Deseret News&quot; as assistant general manager of the Deseret News Press, mainly doing non-newspaper printing. A month later he was made the general manager of the Deseret News Press. At the time, it was the largest printing plant in the United States west of the Mississippi River. Monson remained in this position until 1963, when he was called as apostle.

===Apostleship===
Monson was sustained to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles at general conference on October 4, 1963. He was the youngest man called to the Quorum of the Twelve in 53 years, and was 17 years younger than the next youngest member, Gordon B. Hinckley. He was ordained and set apart on October 10, 1963, by Joseph Fielding Smith.

From 1965 to 1968, Monson oversaw church operations in the South Pacific and Australia. During this time he organized the first LDS stake in Tonga.

With his business background, he helped oversee many church operations, including KSL Newsradio and Bonneville International. He was chairman of the Scripture Publication Committee in the 1970s that oversaw publication of the LDS Church edition of the King James Bible, and revised editions of church scriptures containing footnotes and guides. He also oversaw the church&#x27;s Printing Advisory, Missionary Executive, and General Welfare committees. While an apostle, he continued his education and received a master of business administration degree from Brigham Young University in 1974.

Monson later oversaw church operations in Eastern Europe and helped the church gain access in the Soviet bloc. On August 29, 1982, he organized the first stake in East Germany and was instrumental in obtaining permission for the LDS Church to build a temple in Freiberg, East Germany, which was completed in 1985.

===Other organizations===
In the mid-1950s Monson was the secretary of the Utah State Roller Club, a group of pigeon breeders. Monson was a member of the National Executive Board of Boy Scouts of America starting in 1969. From 1969 to 1988 Monson was on the Mountain Bell Board of Advisors. From 1971 to 1977, he served on the Utah State Board of Higher Education and the Utah State Board of Regents. He was a member of the board of directors of Commercial Security Bank, chairing the bank&#x27;s audit committee for 20 years. In 1993, when the bank was purchased by Key Bank, Monson joined the Board of Directors of Key Bank. In 1981, Ronald Reagan appointed him to the President&#x27;s Task Force on Private Sector Initiatives, serving until its completion in December 1982.

Monson resigned most of his positions in 1996 when church leadership determined all the general authorities should leave all business boards of directors, except for Deseret Management Corporation. From 1965 until 1996 Monson was a member of the Deseret News Publishing Company board of directors. He became chairman of the board of directors in 1977.

===First Presidency===
Following the death of church president Spencer W. Kimball in 1985, newly selected church president Ezra Taft Benson asked Hinckley and Monson to serve as his First and Second Counselors. Monson and Hinckley also served as counselors to Benson&#x27;s successor, Howard W. Hunter. When Hinckley succeeded Hunter in 1995, Monson became his first counselor. He served until Hinckley&#x27;s death on January 27, 2008. As the second most senior of the apostles behind Hinckley, Monson simultaneously served as President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles; Boyd K. Packer (then third in seniority) served as Acting President during that time.

===LDS Church president===
Monson became the 16th president of the LDS Church on February 3, 2008, succeeding Hinckley, who had died seven days earlier. Monson selected Henry B. Eyring and Dieter F. Uchtdorf as his first and second counselors, respectively. When Monson was born, there were fewer than 650,000 church members in the world, most of them living in the western United States. At the time he became the church&#x27;s president, there were over 13 million members worldwide, with the majority living outside the United States and Canada. As of October 2012, 31 temples announced by Monson were either under construction or in planning.

Monson and his counselors met with President George W. Bush on May 29, 2008, during Bush&#x27;s visit to Salt Lake City. He and apostle Dallin H. Oaks met with President Barack Obama and Senator Harry Reid in the Oval Office on July 20, 2009, and presented Obama with five volumes of his personal family history records. Monson did not attend a meeting other church leaders, including Eyring and Uchtdorf, had with Obama during his visit to Utah in April 2015. A church spokesperson indicated the absence was in order to save Monson&#x27;s strength for the church&#x27;s general conference the following weekend. As 2015 progressed, Monson gave the closing talk at the funerals of L. Tom Perry, Boyd K. Packer, and Richard G. Scott.

On May 23, 2017, the LDS Church said Monson would no longer be attending meetings at the church&#x27;s offices on a regular basis, because of limitations incident to age. With his birthday on August 21, 2017, Monson became the seventh president of the LDS Church to be a nonagenarian. Consistent with the May 2017 statement, the LDS Church announced on September 28, 2017, that Monson would not attend the church&#x27;s upcoming general conference, due to the same health and age-related limitations. He was the first church president to miss an entire general conference weekend since Ezra Taft Benson in 1992. The same reason was given when Monson did not attend the funeral of Robert D. Hales, who died on the Sunday of the church&#x27;s October general conference.

===Death===
Monson died of natural causes at the age of 90 on January 2, 2018, at his home in Salt Lake City. The following day, the LDS Church announced that a public viewing would be held on January 11, in the church&#x27;s Conference Center, with funeral services scheduled the following day, also in the Conference Center. His death, along with the passing of Hales a couple of months prior, created two vacancies in the Quorum of the Twelve, which were filled at the next general conference. He was succeeded as church president by Russell M. Nelson.

After Monson&#x27;s death, the obituary posted by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which noted several controversies during his presidency, drew negative attention. The &quot;Times&quot; was criticized for bias against Monson, with one writer citing the obituaries of Fidel Castro and Hugh Hefner in contrast. An online petition asking the &quot;Times&quot; to remove the obituary gained 188,852 signatures, to which the &quot;Times&quot; obituaries editor Bill McDonald responded, &quot;I think the obituary was a faithful accounting of the more prominent issues that Mr. Monson encountered and dealt with publicly during his tenure. Some of these matters — the role of women in the church, the church&#x27;s policy toward homosexuality and same-sex marriage, and more — were widely publicized and discussed, and it&#x27;s our obligation as journalists, whether in an obituary or elsewhere, to fully air these issues from both sides. I think we did that, accurately portraying Mr. Monson&#x27;s positions as leader of the church, and those of the faithful and others who questioned church policies.&quot;

==Legacy==
===Temple dedications===
As church president, Monson dedicated fourteen (and rededicated four) LDS Church temples: Rexburg Idaho, 2008; Curitiba Brazil, 2008; Panamá City Panamá, 2008; Twin Falls Idaho, 2008; México City México (rededication), 2008; Draper Utah, 2009; Oquirrh Mountain Utah, 2009; Vancouver British Columbia, 2010; Gila Valley Arizona, 2010; Cebu City Philippines, 2010; Kyiv Ukraine, 2010; Laie Hawaii (rededication), 2010; Kansas City Missouri, 2012; Calgary Alberta, 2012; Boise Idaho (rededication), 2012; Gilbert Arizona, 2014; Ogden Utah (rededication), 2014; and Phoenix Arizona, 2014.

As a counselor in the First Presidency, Monson dedicated seven church temples: Buenos Aires Argentina, 1986; Louisville Kentucky, 2000; Reno Nevada, 2000; Tampico México, 2000; Villahermosa México, 2000; Mérida México, 2000; and Veracruz México, 2000. Monson attended the dedication of many other LDS Church temples as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve and the First Presidency.

===Volunteer work===
He was president of the Printing Industry of Utah and a former board member of the Printing Industries of America. A Life Scout and Explorer crew member in his youth, Monson served in several adult Scouting leadership capacities: merit badge counselor, member of the Canadian LDS Scouting Committee, chaplain at a Canadian Jamboree, and a member of the General Scouting Committee of the LDS Church. He was also a proponent of the Scouting for Food drive, and he served on the national executive board of the Boy Scouts of America from 1969 to his death. He also represented the Boy Scouts of America as a delegate to the World Conferences in Tokyo, Nairobi, and Copenhagen.

===Political involvement===
In June 2008, Monson and his counselors in the First Presidency sent a letter to local congregations in California, urging them to support Proposition 8 by donating their time and resources, stating that, &quot;Our best efforts are required to preserve the sacred institution of marriage.&quot; In the 2012 Utah voter list he was listed as a registered Republican voter.

===Awards and recognition===

In 1966, Monson was honored as a distinguished alumnus by the University of Utah. His first honorary degree, an Honorary Doctorate of Laws, was conferred in April 1981 by Brigham Young University. He received a Doctor of Humane Letters from Salt Lake Community College in June 1996, an Honorary Doctor of Business from the University of Utah in May 2007, and an honorary doctorate degree in Humanities from Dixie State College in May 2011.

Monson received the Boy Scouts of America&#x27;s Silver Beaver award in 1971 and Silver Buffalo award in 1978, the latter being the highest honor of the BSA. In October 1993, during the Priesthood Session of the church&#x27;s general conference, Monson also received the Bronze Wolf, the highest honor and only award of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, and was recognized for his contributions when a leadership complex at the Summit Bechtel Reserve was named for him. The citation for this award says:

In connection with the LDS Church&#x27;s centennial celebration as a chartered sponsor, the BSA announced that the &quot;Leadership Excellence Complex&quot;, located at The Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve in West Virginia, would be renamed the &quot;Thomas S. Monson Leadership Excellence Complex&quot; and also awarded him Scouting&#x27;s Honor Medal in 2013 for saving the life of a girl who was drowning when he was 12 years old. The Salt Lake chapter of Rotary International honored Monson at its international convention with its Worldwide Humanitarian Award in 2008.

In Slate.com&#x27;s &quot;80 Over 80,&quot; a list of the most powerful octogenarians, Monson placed first in 2009, and first again in 2010. In 2011, Gallup listed Monson as one of &quot;Americans&#x27; 10 Most Admired Men&quot;.

===In popular culture===

Monson was mentioned by name in the 2011 Broadway musical, &quot;The Book of Mormon&quot;. In the song &quot;I Believe,&quot; the character Elder Price states that he believes that as president of the church, Monson has the ability to speak directly to God. His name can still be heard on the cast recording.

==Publications==
Monson wrote a number of books, some of which are compilations of speeches given by him, or of quotes. Others discuss particular LDS gospel themes. He also wrote &quot;Faith Rewarded&quot; which is an autobiographical account about his work in leading the church in Eastern Europe.

<doc id="327674" wikidata="Q316074" url="?curid=327674" title="Cipriano de Rore">
<text>Cipriano de Rore (occasionally Cypriano) (1515 or 1516 – between 11 and 20 September 1565) was a Franco-Flemish composer of the Renaissance, active in Italy. Not only a central representative of the generation of Franco-Flemish composers after Josquin des Prez who went to live and work in Italy, Rore was one of the most prominent composers of madrigals in the middle of the 16th century. His experimental, chromatic, and highly expressive style had a decisive influence on the subsequent development of that secular music form.

==Life==

===Early years===
Little is known of Rore&#x27;s early life. His probable birth years (1515/1516) are known from his age at death (49, recorded on his tombstone in the cathedral in Parma), and his probable birthplace was a small town in Flanders, Ronse (Renaix), on the boundary between the French- and Dutch-speaking areas. Research has established that his parents were Celestinus Rore (died before 1564) and Barbara Van Coppenolle, and he had at least two siblings, Franciscus and Celestinus. The family was active in Ronse at least since 1400, and its coat of arms appeared both on his personal seal and his tombstone in Parma Cathedral.

Where Rore got his musical training is unknown. Based on a suggestive phrase in a 1559 madrigal dedicated to Margaret of Parma, the illegitimate daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, which implied a long association with her, he may have accompanied her when she went to Naples in 1533 before marrying into the Medici family. Margaret was born in a town within walking distance of Rore&#x27;s birthplace. Before that speculative trip Rore may have had some early music instruction in Antwerp. Many gifted singers from the Netherlands went to Italy as children or adolescents, often when discovered by visiting nobility; both Orlande de Lassus and Giaches de Wert traveled to southern Italy in similar circumstances. When Margaret married Alessandro de&#x27; Medici in 1536, Rore may have gone his own way, but he is believed to have received some of his music education in Italy during his period of service with Margaret.

===Venice and Ferrara===
While it has long been claimed that Rore studied in Venice with Adrian Willaert and that he was a singer at San Marco, no specific documentation of either of these events has been found; some dedicatory material in his Venetian publications mentions him as a &quot;disciple&quot; or &quot;follower&quot;, but not specifically as a student. Yet he was closely connected with Willaert and his associates for much of his career, and visited Venice at least once before 1542. Beginning in this year, documentation of Rore&#x27;s whereabouts becomes clearer. A letter written on 3 November 1542 indicates he was at Brescia, where he was known to have remained until 16 April 1545. During this period he began to acquire fame as a composer, publishing, with the Venetian printer Scotto&#x27;s assistance, his first book of madrigals in 1542, as well as two books of motets in 1544 and 1545. The reprints of these works two years later by both Scotto and Gardane indicated their high regard. Their technical mastery and stylistic indebtedness to Willaert and his circle make an early connection with Venice a reasonable supposition.

Rore then went to Ferrara, where payment records show he was &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; (choirmaster) beginning on 6 May 1546. This was the beginning of an extraordinarily productive portion of his life; while in the service of Duke Ercole II d&#x27;Este he wrote masses, motets, chansons, and of course madrigals, many of which were topical, some involving matters of the court itself. In 1556 Duke Ercole awarded Rore a benefice for his exceptional service. Also during the Ferrara years, Rore began cultivating his relations with the court of Albrecht V of Bavaria in Munich, sending them music, and having 26 motets produced in an elaborately illustrated manuscript with miniatures by Hans Muelich. In 1558 he requested a leave of absence from his employer in Ferrara to return to his homeland to care for his ailing parents. He stopped in Munich on the way, reaching the city on 1 May, where he assisted in preparation of the motet manuscript, and posed for the Muelich portrait. A document of September 1558 places him in Flanders, where he was helping his sister-in-law with estate matters on the death of Celistinus, his brother. By December he had returned to Ferrara.

===Departure from Ferrara; last years===
In July 1559 Rore left his post in Ferrara again, possibly because the new Duke Alfonso II d&#x27;Este preferred Francesco dalla Viola, a member of an old Ferrara family, to the foreigner. Once again he went north to his homeland; this time he did not return to Este service.

The situation in his homeland had deteriorated due to the ravages of the Wars of Independence, and when Rore reached it in autumn 1559, he found that his home town, Ronse, had been destroyed. Unable to regain his employment in Ferrara, he reentered the service of the House of Farnese, and after a stay in Antwerp, returned to Italy again, this time to Parma, in 1560. Unhappy there—Parma was not an intellectual and cultural center on the level of Ferrara or Venice—he left in 1563, briefly taking the prestigious position of &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; at St. Mark&#x27;s upon Willaert&#x27;s death. But he kept this post only into 1564, when he returned to Parma; he gave as his reason for departing Venice the disorder in the chapel and an insufficient salary.

He died at Parma the next year of unknown causes at age 49 and was buried in the cathedral in that city. Lodovico Rore, his nephew, erected his tombstone, indicating in the epitaph that his name would not be forgotten, even in the distant future.

==Music and influence==
Rore was one of the most influential composers of the mid-16th century, mainly through the dissemination of his madrigals. His 1542 book was an extraordinary event, and recognized as such at the time: it established five voices as the norm, rather than four, and married the polyphonic texture of the Netherlandish motet with the Italian secular form, bringing a seriousness of tone that became one of the predominant trends in madrigal composition all the way into the 17th century. All the lines of development in the madrigal in the late century can be traced to ideas first seen in Rore; according to Alfred Einstein, his only true spiritual successor was Claudio Monteverdi, another revolutionary. But in his sacred music, Rore was more backward-looking, showing his connection to his Netherlandish roots: his masses, for example, are reminiscent of the work of Josquin des Prez.

Rore wrote 107 madrigals that are securely attributed to him; 16 secular Latin compositions, similar in form to madrigals; at least seven chansons; 53 motets, of which 51 survive; a Passion according to Saint John; five settings of the mass; some Magnificats; and a handful of other works.

While best known for his Italian madrigals, Rore was also a prolific composer of sacred music, both masses and motets. Josquin was his point of departure, and he developed many of his techniques from the older composer&#x27;s style. Rore&#x27;s first three masses are a response to the challenge of his heritage and to the music of Josquin. In addition to five masses, he wrote about 80 motets, many psalms, secular motets, and a setting of the St. John Passion.

===Secular music===
It was as a composer of madrigals that Rore achieved enduring fame. With his madrigals published primarily between 1542 and 1565, he was one of the most influential madrigalists at mid-century. His early madrigals reflect Willaert with the use of clear diction, thick and continuous counterpoint, and pervasive imitation. These works are mostly for four or five voices, with one for six and another for eight. The tone of his writing tends toward the serious, especially as contrasted with the light character of the work of his predecessors Arcadelt and Verdelot. Rore chose not to write madrigals of frivolous nature, preferring serious subject matter, including the works of Petrarch and tragedies presented at Ferrara. He carefully brought out the varying moods of the texts he set, developing musical devices for this purpose; additionally he often ignored the structure of the line, line division, and rhyme, deeming it unnecessary that the musical and poetic lines correspond.

In addition, Rore experimented with chromaticism, following some of the ideas of his contemporary Nicola Vicentino. He used all the resources of polyphony as they had developed by the mid-16th century, including imitation and canonic techniques, all in the service of careful text setting.

Rore was the model many of the great madrigalists of the late 16th century followed, including Monteverdi. According to Alfred Einstein, writing in &quot;The Italian Madrigal&quot; (1949), Rore&#x27;s true spiritual successor was Monteverdi. Einstein also said, &quot;Rore holds the key to the whole development of the Italian madrigal after 1550.&quot;

Rore also composed secular Latin motets, a relatively unusual &quot;crossover&quot; form in the mid-16th century. These motets, a secular variation of a normally sacred form, paralleled the sacred madrigal, the &quot;madrigale spirituale&quot;, a sacred variation on a popular secular form. Stylistically they are similar to his madrigals, and he published them throughout his career; occasionally they appeared in collections of madrigals, such as in his posthumous Fifth Book for five voices (1566), and he also included some in a collection of motets for five voices published in 1545.

<doc id="327685" wikidata="Q1034449" url="?curid=327685" title="Cape Lookout National Seashore">
<text>Cape Lookout National Seashore preserves a 56-mile (90-km) long section of the Southern Outer Banks, or Crystal Coast, of North Carolina, United States, running from Ocracoke Inlet on the northeast to Beaufort Inlet on the southwest. Three undeveloped barrier islands make up the seashore - North and South Core Banks and Shackleford Banks. The seashore includes two historic villages on Core Banks, Shackleford&#x27;s wild horses, and the Cape Lookout Lighthouse, which has a black-and-white diamond pattern. A visitor center for the seashore is located on Harkers Island.

The National Park Service, as part of their Centennial Initiative celebrating its 100th anniversary in 2016, is planning to rehabilitate the Lighthouse and restore the Cape Lookout and Portsmouth Village Historic Districts.

== History ==
The National Seashore was authorized on March 10, 1966. It was named a North Carolina Natural Heritage Area on May 23, 1986. The seashore was designated the Carolinian-South Atlantic Biosphere Reserve on June 16, 1986. Near noon on September 9, 2007, Tropical Storm Gabrielle made landfall at this exact point with winds of . Damage was light but flooding and beach erosion affected this lookout. On August 27, 2011, Hurricane Irene made landfall near Cape Lookout as a Category 1 storm with 85 mph sustained winds. Hurricane Arthur also made landfall near Cape Lookout as a Category 2 storm with 100 mph sustained winds.

==Laws==
The Corolla Wild Horses Protection Act (H.R. 126;113th Congress), if passed, would take wild horses from herds on the Cape Lookout National Seashore and introduced them to the herds in the Currituck National Wildlife Refuge in order to ensure genetic viability.

==Map==
==Climate==
According to the Trewartha climate classification system, Cape Lookout National Seashore, North Carolina has a humid subtropical climate with hot and humid summers, cool winters and year-around precipitation (&quot;Cfak&quot;). Cfak climates are characterized by all months having an average mean temperature &gt; 32.0 °F (&gt; 0.0 °C), at least eight months with an average mean temperature ≥ 50.0 °F (≥ 10.0 °C), at least one month with an average mean temperature ≥ 71.6 °F (≥ 22.0 °C) and no significant precipitation difference between seasons. During the summer months in Cape Lookout National Seashore, a cooling afternoon sea breeze is present on most days, but episodes of extreme heat and humidity can occur with heat index values ≥ 100 °F (≥ 38 °C). Cape Lookout National Seashore is prone to hurricane strikes, particularly during the Atlantic hurricane season which extends from June 1 through November 30, sharply peaking from late August through September. During the winter months, episodes of cold and wind can occur with wind chill values &lt; 10 °F (&lt; -12 °C). The plant hardiness zone at Core Sound in Cape Lookout National Seashore is 8b with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of 16.6 °F (-8.6 °C). The average seasonal (Dec-Mar) snowfall total is &lt; 2 inches (&lt; 5 cm), and the average annual peak in nor&#x27;easter activity is in February.

==Ecology==

According to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. potential natural vegetation types, Cape Lookout National Seashore, North Carolina would have a dominant vegetation type of Live oak/Sea Oats Uniola paniculata (&quot;90&quot;) with a dominant vegetation form of Coastal Prairie (&quot;20&quot;).

<doc id="327690" wikidata="Q1356512" url="?curid=327690" title="Toussaint Charbonneau">
<text>Toussaint Charbonneau (March 20, 1767 – August 12, 1843) was a French Canadian explorer, fur trapper and merchant who is best known for his role in the Lewis and Clark Expedition as the husband of Sacagawea.

==Early years==
Charbonneau was born in Boucherville, located in what is now the province of Québec (near Montréal) around 1759 or 1767. Boucherville was a community with strong links to exploration and the fur trade. 
It has been claimed that he was of French and Iroquois ancestry, though there is no evidence to support this. His genealogy compiled by the PRDH project at the Université de Montréal shows a strictly French ancestry.
His paternal great-grandmother Marguerite de Noyon was the sister of Jacques de Noyon, who had explored the region around Kaministiquia, present-day Thunder Bay, Ontario, in 1688. In the late 1790s, Charbonneau became a fur trader who lived among the Hidatsa and Mandan native tribes.

For a time, Charbonneau worked as a fur trapper with the North West Company (NWC), assigned to the Pine Fort on the Assiniboine River in what is now Manitoba. The North West Company was founded to compete with the dominant Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, which was an English company that employed many Frenchmen. This company pushed west, which allowed it to trade with the Mandan and Hidatsa native tribes. John MacDonell, the recorder of one of their expeditions, first noted Charbonneau in their historical journal. After several routine mentions of Charbonneau, MacDonell wrote on May 30, 1795: &quot;Toussaint. Charbonneau was stabbed at the Manitou-a-banc end of the Portage la Prairie, Manitoba in the act of committing a Rape upon her Daughter by an old Saultier woman with a Canoe Awl— a fate he highly deserved for his brutality— It was with difficulty he could walk back over the portage.&quot;

While living among the Hidatsa people, Charbonneau purchased or won a Shoshone girl: Sacagawea (Bird Woman) from the Hidatsa. The Hidatsa had captured Sacagawea on one of their annual raiding and hunting parties to the west. Sacagawea may have had little choice in the matter, or she may have chosen to go with Charbonneau because doing so was preferable to her previous position. When Charbonneau married Sacagawea in 1804, he was already married to Otter Woman, another Shoshone woman. Charbonneau eventually considered these women to be his wives, though whether they were bound through Native American custom or through common-law marriage is undetermined. By the summer of 1804, Sacagawea was pregnant with their first child.

==Lewis and Clark Expedition==
In November 1804, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark came to the area, built Fort Mandan, and recruited members to the Corps of Discovery. Originally, Lewis and Clark were working with a Frenchman named Larocque, however the relationship became increasingly tense. This led Lewis and Clark to recruit Charbonneau who worked under Laroque. Charbonneau was asked to join the expedition as a translator. While Charbonneau could speak French and some Hidatsa, Lewis and Clark were more enthusiastic about having two Shoshone women join them. With Charbonneau, Sacagawea, and Otter Woman&#x27;s skills combined, the expedition gained the ability to speak Hidatsa and Shoshone. They hired Charbonneau on November 4, and his wives moved into Fort Mandan with Charbonneau a week later.

On February 11, 1805 at the fort, Charbonneau and Sacagawea&#x27;s son Jean-Baptiste was born. William Clark nicknamed the baby Pomp.

In the winter, as the expedition was being prepared, Charbonneau had second thoughts about his role with Lewis and Clark. This was because Charbonneau had received gifts from the North West Company upon news of his newborn son. The gifts given to him included: two arms’ length of scarlet cloth and one of blue, a pair of corduroy coats, one vest, a length of red cloth decorated with bars, 200 musket balls, a supply of powder, three knives, and some tobacco. This upset Lewis and Clark as they saw these gifts as a bribe for Charbonneau to work with the company to deter American ventures in the fur trade. On top of being dissatisfied with the requirement to stand guard and perform manual labor amongst other tasks, he was also being treated as a traitor by his new employers. On March 12, 1805, he quit the expedition. However, on March 17 he returned and apologized, requesting to re-join the company; he was re-hired the following day. His performance during the journey was mixed: Meriwether Lewis called him &quot;a man of no peculiar merit&quot;, and many historians have painted Charbonneau in a distinctly unfavorable light. One of the most well-known anecdotes about Charbonneau is the incident with the &quot;white pirogue.&quot; On May 14, 1805, the pirogue guided by Charbonneau was hit by a gust of wind and lost control. Charbonneau panicked and nearly capsized the boat, which would have meant the loss of valuable equipment and papers. It was only with the help of his wife, Sacagawea, that these important items were saved. Meriwether Lewis was irate, writing that Charbonneau was &quot;perhaps the most timid waterman in the world.&quot; Charbonneau was also known for his short temper with his wives. On August 14, 1805, he struck Sacagawea in a fit of anger and was reprimanded by Clark. This occasion, in addition to committing rape earlier in his life, gave Charbonneau a bad reputation.

Charbonneau, however, did make several contributions to the success of the expedition. He was helpful when the expedition encountered French trappers from Canada as he shared their language. He also was the cook for the expeidition. Several members of the party praised his &quot;boudin blanc&quot;, a boiled and fried sausage made from bison meat. Additionally, his skill in striking a bargain came in handy when the expedition was in strong need for horses and was at a Shoshone encampment, the people of his wives.

Charbonneau and his family stayed with the Lewis and Clark expedition until August 1806. He was paid $500.33, plus a horse and a lodge, for his nineteen months with the expedition. In addition to the payment, William Clark wrote a parting letter to Charbonneau, inviting a continued relationship. He even asked if it was possible for Jean Baptiste to stay with the expedition to be raised by Clark.

== Life after the expedition ==
Clark offered to set up Charbonneau and his family in St. Louis after the expedition. Charbonneau initially declined Clark&#x27;s offer, as he preferred life with the Mandan and Hidatsa. However, the family relocated to St. Louis in 1809 so that Jean Baptiste could be educated. Charbonneau bought land from Clark and briefly took up farming. He gave it up after a few months, selling the land back to Clark for 100 dollars. He also left Sacagawea and his two sons Toussaint and Jean Baptiste in Clark’s protection. In April, 1811, Charbonneau started working for Henry M. Brackenridge, an explorer headed up the Missouri River. In Charbonneau’s company was his older wife, Otter Woman.

He then took a job with Manuel Lisa&#x27;s Missouri Fur Company, and was stationed at Fort Manuel Lisa Trading Post in present-day North Dakota. During this time, Sacagawea was pregnant and gave birth to a girl named Lisette. Shortly after the birth, Sacagawea died on December 20, 1812. Lisette was taken back to St. Louis to live with Jean Baptiste. The following year Charbonneau signed over formal custody of his son Jean Baptiste and daughter Lisette to William Clark.

During the period of 1811–1838, Charbonneau also worked for the Upper Missouri Agency&#x27;s Indian Bureau (a federal agency) as a translator. He earned from $300 to $400 per year from the government. He may have gained this position by the patronage of William Clark, who was from 1813 the governor of the Missouri Territory; upon Clark&#x27;s death, Charbonneau&#x27;s employment with the government came to an abrupt halt. Surviving records show that Charbonneau was widely disliked by others in the Missouri Territory. Part of the reason for this may be his casual attitude toward employment: he was variously hired by Lisa&#x27;s Missouri Fur Company and by John Jacob Astor&#x27;s American Fur Company, bitter rivals. He is also said to have abandoned another employer, James Kipp, while on a fur expedition in 1834.

Charbonneau is known to have had a total of five wives, all young Native American women whom he married when they were sixteen years old or younger. He may have had more wives who have been lost to the record, however. His last known wife, an Assiniboine girl, was 14 when she married him in 1837; he was more than 70 years old.

=== Death ===
While his exact death date is not known, Charbonneau probably died in 1843, because that is the year Jean-Baptiste settled his father&#x27;s estate. It is generally accepted that he died and was buried in Fort Mandan, North Dakota, but some believe he is buried in Richwoods, Missouri with a headstone marked &quot;Toussaint Charboneau, 1781–1866&quot; [sic]. While these dates are wrong, people in Richwoods claim to be descendants of Charbonneau.

<text>The Yongle Encyclopedia () or Yongle Dadian () is a Chinese &quot;leishu&quot; encyclopedia commissioned by the Yongle Emperor (1402–1424) of the Ming dynasty in 1403 and completed by 1408. It comprised 22,937 manuscript rolls in 11,095 volumes. Fewer than 400 volumes survive today, comprising about 800 rolls, or 3.5% of the original work. 

Most of the text was lost during the latter half of the 19th century, in the midst of events including the Second Opium War and the Boxer Rebellion. Its sheer scope and size made it the world&#x27;s largest general encyclopedia, until it was surpassed by Wikipedia in late 2007, nearly six centuries later.

==Background==
Although known for his military achievements, the Yongle Emperor (1402–1424) was an intellectual who enjoyed reading. His love for research led him to develop the idea of categorizing literary works into a reference encyclopedia to preserve rare books and simplify research. Instrumental to this undertaking were the Yongle Emperor&#x27;s own changes to the function of the Hanlin Academy. 

Prior to his reign, the Hanlin Academy was responsible for various clerical tasks such as drafting proclamations and edicts. The Yongle Emperor decided to elevate the status of the Hanlin Academy and began selecting only the highest-ranking recruits for the academy. Clerical duties were relegated to Imperial officers, whereas the Hanlin Academy, now full of elite scholars, began to work on literary projects for the Emperor.

== Development ==
The &quot;Yongle Encyclopedia&quot; was commissioned by the Yongle Emperor and completed in 1408. In 1404, a year after the work was commissioned, a team of 100 scholars, mostly from the Hanlin Academy, completed a manuscript called &quot;A Complete Work of Literature.&quot; The Yongle Emperor rejected this work and insisted on adding other volumes. 

In 1405, under the Yongle Emperor&#x27;s command, the number of scholars rose to 2,169. Scholars were sent all over China to find books and expand the encyclopedia. The Yongle Emperor assigned his personal advisor, Dao Yan, a monk, and Liu Jichi, the deputy minister of punishment, as co-editors of the encyclopedia, supporting Yao Guangxiao. The scholars spent four years compiling the &quot;leishu&quot; encyclopedia, under the leadership of general editor Yao Guangxiao.

The encyclopedia was completed in 1408 at the Guozijian in Nanjing (now Nanjing University). It comprised 22,937 manuscript rolls or chapters, in 11,095 volumes, occupying roughly , and using 370 million Chinese characters — the equivalent of about a quarter of a billion English words (around six times as many as the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;).

The &quot;leishu&quot; was intended to include every commentary that had been written on the Chinese classics, as well as all history, philosophy, arts and sciences. It was a massive collation of excerpts and works from the entirety of Chinese literature and knowledge. The Yongle Emperor was so pleased with the finished encyclopedia that he named it after his reign, and personally wrote a lengthy preface highlighting the importance of preserving the works.

== Style ==
The encyclopedia&#x27;s physical appearance differed from any other Chinese encyclopedias of the time. It was larger in size, used special paper, and was bound in a &quot;wrapped back&quot; (, &quot;bao bei zhuang&quot;) style. The use of red ink for titles and authors, an ink exclusively reserved for the emperor, helped to confirm that the volumes were of royal production. 

Each volume was protected by a hard cover which was wrapped in yellow silk. Unlike other encyclopedias, it was not arranged by subject, but by (&quot;Hongwu zhengyun&quot;), a system by which characters are ordered phonetically or rhythmically. The use of this system helped the reader find specific entries with ease. 

Although printing already existed during the Ming dynasty, the &quot;Yongle Encyclopedia&quot; was exclusively handwritten. Each handwritten entry was a collection of existing literature, some of which derived from rare and delicate texts. The importance of the &quot;Yongle Encyclopedia&quot; was the preservation of such texts, and the vast number of subjects it covered.

== Reception ==
At the end of the Ming, scholars began to question the Yongle Emperor&#x27;s motives for not commissioning more copies of the encyclopedia, instead of keeping them in storage. Some scholars, like Sun Chengze, a Qing scholar, theorized that the Yongle Emperor used the literary project for political reasons. At the time, Neo-Confucians were refusing to take civil service exams, or participate in any imperial duties, due to the Yongle Emperor&#x27;s violent usurpation of the throne. The Yongle Emperor&#x27;s literary undertaking did attract the attention of these scholars, who eventually joined the project. 

Because the Yongle Emperor did not want a strictly Confucian point of view for the encyclopedia, non-Confucian scholars were also included, and contributed to the Buddhist, Daoist, and Divination sections of the encyclopedia. The inclusion of these subjects intensified the scrutiny against the Yongle Emperor amongst Neo-Confucians who believed the encyclopedia was nothing but &quot;wheat and chaff&quot;. However, despite the varied opinions, the encyclopedia is widely regarded as a priceless contribution in preserving a wide range of China&#x27;s historic works, many of which would be lost otherwise.

==Disappearance==
The &quot;Yongle Dadian&quot; was placed in Wenyuan Ge () in Nanjing until 1421, when the Yongle Emperor moved the capital to Beijing and placed the Yongle Dadian in the Forbidden City. In 1557, during the reign of the Jiajing Emperor, the encyclopedia was narrowly saved from a fire that burnt down three palaces in the Forbidden City. A manuscript copy was commissioned by Jiajing Emperor in 1562 and completed in 1567. The original copy was lost afterwards. The theories as to what happened to the original are:

*The original was destroyed in late Ming dynasty. In 1644, rebel leader Li Zicheng overthrew the Ming dynasty and took over the Ming capital, Beijing. A few months later, he was defeated by the coalition of Wu Sangui and Dorgon. Li burned the Forbidden City when he withdrew from Beijing. The &quot;Yongle Dadian&quot; may have been destroyed in the fire.
*The original was buried with the Jiajing Emperor. The time when the Jiajing Emperor was buried was very close to the time of completion of the manuscript copy. Jiajing Emperor died in December 1566, but was buried three months later, in March 1567. One possibility is that they were waiting for the manuscript to be completed.
*The original was burned in the Qianqing Palace fire.
*The original was hidden.

The original manuscript of the &quot;Yongle Dadian&quot; was almost completely lost by the end of the Ming dynasty. 90 percent of the 1567 manuscript survived until the Second Opium War during the Qing dynasty. In 1860, the Anglo-French invasion of Beijing resulted in the majority of the encyclopedia being burnt or looted, with British and French soldiers taking large portions of the manuscript as souvenirs. 

5,000 volumes remained by 1875, less than half of the original, which dwindled to 800 by 1894. During the Boxer Rebellion and the 1900 Eight-Nation Alliance occupation of Beijing, allied soldiers took hundreds of volumes, and many were destroyed in the Hanlin Academy fire. Only 60 volumes remained in Beijing.

==Current status==
The most complete collection is kept at the National Library of China in Beijing, which holds 221 volumes. The next largest collection is at the National Palace Museum in Taipei, which holds 62 volumes.

Sections 10,270 and 10,271 of the &quot;Yongle Encyclopedia&quot; reside at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California.

51 volumes are in the United Kingdom held at the British Library, the Bodleian Library in Oxford, the School of Oriental and African Studies of the University of London, and Cambridge University Library; the Library of Congress of the United States holds 41 volumes; Cornell University Library has 6 volumes; 5 volumes are held in various libraries across Germany.

Two volumes were sold at a Paris auction on July 7, 2020, for more than €8 million (US$9 million).

<doc id="327696" wikidata="Q3471137" url="?curid=327696" title="Samuel Griffith">
<text>Sir Samuel Walker Griffith (21 June 1845 – 9 August 1920) was an Australian judge and politician who served as the inaugural Chief Justice of Australia, in office from 1903 to 1919. He also served a term as Chief Justice of Queensland and two terms as Premier of Queensland, and played a key role in the drafting of the Australian Constitution.

Griffith was born in Queensland arriving in the Moreton Bay district of New South Wales (but now in the state of Queensland) at the age of eight. He attended the University of Sydney, and after further legal training was called to the bar in 1867. Griffith was elected to the Queensland Legislative Assembly in 1872. He served as Attorney-General from 1874 to 1878, and subsequently became the leader of the parliament&#x27;s liberal faction. Griffith&#x27;s terms as premier ran from 1883 to 1888 and from 1890 to 1893. He led the Australian delegation to the 1887 Colonial Conference and took a keen interest in external affairs, giving financial and administrative support to the newly annexed Territory of Papua and establishing the Queensland Maritime Defence Force. Domestically, he had a reputation as a radical and was initially seen as an ally of the labour movement; this changed after his government&#x27;s intervention in the 1891 shearers&#x27; strike.

In 1899, Griffith retired from politics to head the Supreme Court of Queensland. He was frequently asked to assist in drafting legislation, and the Queensland criminal code – the first in Australia – was mostly his creation. Griffith was an ardent federationist, and with Andrew Inglis Clark wrote the draft constitution that was presented to the 1891 constitutional convention. Many of his contributions were preserved in the final constitution enacted in 1900. Griffith was involved in the drafting of the federal &quot;Judiciary Act 1903&quot;, which established the High Court of Australia, and was subsequently nominated by Alfred Deakin to become the inaugural Chief Justice. He presided over a number of constitutional cases, though some of his interpretations were rejected by later courts. He was also called on to advise governors-general during political instability. Griffith University and the Canberra suburb of Griffith are named in his honour.

==Early life==
Griffith was born in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, the younger son of the Rev. Edward Griffith, a Congregational minister and his wife, Mary, second daughter of Peter Walker. His sister was the philanthropist Mary Harriett Griffith. Although of Welsh extraction, his forebears for at least three generations had lived in England. The family migrated to the Moreton Bay district of New South Wales (now the state of Queensland) when Samuel was eight. He was educated at schools in Ipswich, where his father was minister from 1854 to 1856, and Sydney, and later at William McIntyre&#x27;s school in Maitland, where he earned the nickname &quot;Oily Sam&quot; for his &quot;ability to argue on any side of any subject&quot;. He continued his studies at the University of Sydney, where he graduated Bachelor of Arts in 1863, with first-class honours in classics, mathematics and natural science. During his course he was awarded the Cooper and Barker scholarships and other prizes.Griffith was born in 1835 July 7th.

In 1865, he gained the T. S. Mort Travelling Fellowship. Travelling to Europe, he spent some of his time in Italy, and became much attached to the Italian people and their literature. Many years after, he was to become the first Australian translator of Dante (&quot;The Inferno of Dante Alighieri&quot; in 1908).

On his return to Brisbane, Griffith studied law and was articled to Arthur Macalister, in one of whose ministries Griffith afterwards had his first portfolio. Griffith was called to the bar in 1867.

In 1870, Griffith returned to Sydney to complete a Master of Arts. In the same year, he married Julia Janet Thomson.

==Political career==
In 1872 Griffith was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland, for East Moreton. Throughout his career he saw himself as a lawyer first and a politician second, and continued to appear at the Bar even when he was in office. Griffith took silk in 1876 as a Queen&#x27;s Counsel. In Parliament he gained a reputation as a liberal reformer. He was Attorney-General, Minister for Education and Minister for Works, and became leader of the liberal faction (unrelated to the modern day Liberal Party) in 1879. His great enemy was the conservative leader Sir Thomas McIlwraith, whom he accused (correctly) of corruption.

Griffith had had a distinguished career in Queensland politics. Included in the legislation for which he was responsible were an offenders&#x27; probation act, and an act which codified the law relating to the duties and powers of justices of the peace. He also succeeded in passing an eight hours bill through the assembly which was, however, thrown out by the Queensland Legislative Council.

Griffith became Premier in November 1883 displacing McIlwraith. Griffith&#x27;s election as Premier was assisted by auditor-general William Leworthy Goode Drew&#x27;s report on the colony&#x27;s loans having reached over £13 million. Griffith won the next election largely on his policy of preventing the importation of Kanaka labour from the islands. He passed an act for this purpose, but it was found that the danger of the destruction of the sugar industry was so great that the measure was never made operative. Recruiting was, however, placed under regulations and some of the worst abuses were swept away. Griffith took a special interest in British New Guinea, and was eventually responsible for the sending of Sir William MacGregor there in 1888.

Griffith held the office of premier until 1888, and was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1886, before receiving an advancement to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1895. Griffith was regarded as a close ally of the labour movement. He introduced a bill to legalise trade unions, and declared that &quot;the great problem of this age is not how to accumulate wealth but how to secure its more equitable distribution&quot;. In 1888 his government was defeated. In opposition he wrote radical articles for &quot;The Boomerang&quot;, William Lane&#x27;s socialist newspaper.

But in 1890 Griffith suddenly betrayed his radical friends and became Premier again at the head of an unlikely alliance with McIlwraith, the so-called &quot;Griffilwraith&quot;. The following year his government took an active role in arresting and prosecuting leaders of the 1891 shearers&#x27; strike, with Griffith personally praising this decision. Consequently, William Lane declared Griffith a &quot;fraud&quot; in his 1892 novel &quot;The Workingman&#x27;s Paradise&quot;.

==Chief Justice of Queensland==
On 13 March 1893, the Governor accepted Griffith&#x27;s resignation from Vice-President and Member of the Executive Council and Chief Secretary and Attorney General and appointed Griffith to Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Queensland where he served until 4 October 1903. In consequence he could not be a delegate to the Federal Australasian Convention of 1897-8 which produced, in near final form, the Constitution of Australia, but he acted as a behind-the-scenes advisor to Sir Robert Garran, secretary of the Drafting Committee, which followed the structure he had laid out in 1891. In 1899 he campaigned publicly for a &#x27;yes&#x27; vote in the federation referendum in Queensland. In May 1900 he authored the very last amendment to the Constitution in the face of a standoff between the Colonial Secretary, Joseph Chamberlain and Edmund Barton over the right to appeal judgements of the High Court of Australia to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Whereas Chamberlain wished the Constitution to give more space to such appeals, Barton, with Charles Kingston and Alfred Deakin, wanted them left restricted. Griffith privately damned the behaviour of Barton and Kingston as &quot;monstrous&quot;, and formulated the compromise wording which appears in Section 74, and which appeased the involved parties.

During his term as Chief Justice Griffith drafted Queensland&#x27;s Criminal Code, a successful codification of the entire English criminal law, which was adopted in 1899, and later in Western Australia, Papua New Guinea, substantially in Tasmania, and other imperial territories including Nigeria.

==Chief Justice of Australia==

When the federal parliament passed the &quot;Judiciary Act 1903&quot;, which created the High Court of Australia, Griffith was the natural choice as the first Chief Justice. Griffith&#x27;s appointment as one of the first three judges of the High Court was approved by the Governor-General on 5 October 1903. During his sixteen years on the bench Griffith sat on some 950 reported cases. In 1913 he visited England and sat on the Privy Council. Like Sir Edmund Barton, Griffith was several times consulted by Governors-General of Australia on the exercise of the reserve powers.

Griffith was the first of two justices of the High Court of Australia to have previously served in the Parliament of Queensland, along with Charles Powers. He was also one of five justices to have previously served on the Supreme Court of Queensland, along with William Webb, Harry Gibbs, Susan Kiefel and Patrick Keane. After 1910 Griffith&#x27;s health declined, and in 1917 he suffered a stroke. He published a translation of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divina Commedia&quot; in 1912.

===Royal Commissions===
In January 1918, Griffith was appointed by Prime Minister Billy Hughes as head of a Royal Commission into the recruitment levels needed to maintain the Australian Imperial Force&#x27;s fighting strength overseas. This came only a month after a second referendum on overseas conscription had returned a vote in the negative. Griffith was given such narrow terms of reference that his report took only a single week, and was effectively little more than a mathematical problem relating to the &quot;existing size of the AIF, likely future losses of men, the numbers required to replace them, and so on&quot;. After the report was released, Hughes used it as vindication of his statements during the referendum debate.

Later writers have seen Griffith&#x27;s involvement in the Royal Commission as inadvisable, as the findings were able to be used for political purposes and thus could be seen to have breached the separation of powers. It is the most recent occasion on which a sitting High Court judge has chaired a Royal Commission; Griffith had also authorised the first, which was conducted by George Rich in 1915 and also concerned military issues. However, in July 1918 he rejected another request from Hughes for a High Court judge to conduct a Royal Commission, on the grounds that it would &quot;associate the High Court with political action&quot;.

==Retirement and death==

Griffith retired from the Court in 1919 and died at his home in Brisbane on 9 August 1920. He is buried in Toowong Cemetery, Brisbane, together with his wife, Julia, and their son, Llewellyn. Cemetery records indicate that their plot adjoins that of Griffith&#x27;s dear friend Charles Mein (1841–1890) (barrister, politician and judge), the pair having met during their undergraduate studies at the University of Sydney.

==Honours==
Griffith is commemorated by the naming of Griffith University, with campuses throughout South East Queensland, the suburb of Griffith in Canberra, the federal electoral division of Griffith, Sir Samuel Griffith Drive on Mount Coot-tha in Brisbane, and the S.W. Griffith building of Brisbane Grammar School, which was the former Mathematics building and is now part of the Harlin House boarding precinct. The Samuel Griffith Society is a conservative organisation dedicated to defending what it sees as the principles of the Constitution – particularly, the principle of states&#x27; rights. His portrait, by Richard Godfrey Rivers, hangs in the Brisbane Supreme Court. Griffith was appointed a vice-president of the Royal Colonial Institute in 1909 and an honorary fellow of the British Academy in 1916.

In July 2016 Griffith was inducted in to the City of Maitland Hall of Fame.

Although demolished in 1963, his home &quot;Merthyr&quot;, named after his birthplace, gives its name to the neighbourhood of Merthyr in New Farm. Griffith Street and Merthyr Road in New Farm are also named after the man and his house.

<doc id="327700" wikidata="Q439144" url="?curid=327700" title="André-Hercule de Fleury">
<text>André-Hercule de Fleury (22 June or 26 June 165329 January 1743) was a French Catholic prelate who served as Bishop of Fréjus and as the chief minister of Louis XV. He was created a cardinal in 1726 by Pope Benedict XIII.

==Life and government==
He was born in Lodève, Hérault, the son of a tax farmer of a noble family. He was sent to Paris as a child to be educated by the Jesuits in philosophy and the Classics as much as in theology. He entered the priesthood nevertheless and through the influence of Cardinal Bonzi became almoner to Maria Theresa, queen of Louis XIV, and, after her death, to the king himself. In 1698 he was appointed bishop of Fréjus, but seventeen years in a provincial see eventually determined him to seek a position at court.

In May 1715, a few months before the Sun-King&#x27;s death, Fleury became tutor to Louis&#x27; great-grandson and heir, and in spite of a seeming lack of ambition, he acquired an influence over the child that was never broken, fostered by Louis&#x27; love and confidence. On the death of the regent Philippe d&#x27;Orléans in 1723, Louis XV came of age. Fleury, although already seventy years of age, deferred his own supremacy by suggesting the appointment of Louis Henri, duke of Bourbon, as first minister. Fleury was present at all interviews between Louis XV and his titular first minister, and on Bourbon&#x27;s attempt to break through this rule Fleury retired from court. Louis made Bourbon recall the tutor, who on 11 June 1726 took affairs into his own hands and secured the exile from court of Bourbon and of his mistress Madame de Prie. He continued to refuse the formal title of first minister, but his elevation to cardinal, in 1726, confirmed his precedence over any others.

Under the Régence, the Scottish economist John Law had introduced financial measures that were modern for the time: a national bank, easy credit to encourage investors, and paper money exchangeable for gold bullion. Investor overconfidence in the ability to exchange paper money for gold led to wild speculation after 1720, and when the bubble burst, Law and his policies were thoroughly discredited, and French finances were in as dire straits as they had been when Louis XIV died. Fleury was imperturbable in his demeanor, frugal and prudent, and he carried these qualities into the administration. In 1726 he fixed the standard of the currency and secured French credit by initiating regular payment of interest on the national debt, with the result that in 1738/39 there was a surplus of 15,000,000 &quot;livres&quot; instead of the usual deficit. Fleury&#x27;s stringencies were enforced through the &quot;contrôleur général des finances&quot; Philibert Orry (who remained in office until 1745). By exacting forced labor from the peasants (see corvée) he improved France&#x27;s roads, though at the cost of rousing angry discontent, which later found expression in the French Revolution. During the seventeen years of his orderly government, the country found time to recuperate its forces after the exhaustion caused by the ambitions of Louis XIV and extravagances of the regent, and national prosperity increased. Social peace was seriously disturbed by the severities which Fleury exercised against the Jansenists. He was one of the minority of French bishops who published Clement XI&#x27;s bull &quot;Unigenitus&quot; and imprisoned priests who refused to accept it, and he met the Jansenist opposition of the Parlement of Paris by exiling forty of its members to a &quot;gilded cage&quot; not far from Paris.

In foreign affairs, the maintenance of peace was a preoccupation he shared with Sir Robert Walpole, and the two old enemies refrained from war during Fleury&#x27;s ministry. Some Jacobite sympathizers in France had formed lodges of Freemasons; their attempts to influence Fleury to support the Stuart faction led instead to raids on their premises, and Fleury urged Pope Clement XII to issue a bull in 1738 that forbade all Roman Catholics to become Freemasons under threat of excommunication. It was only with reluctance that he supported the ambitious projects of Elizabeth Farnese, queen of Spain, in Italy by guaranteeing in 1729 the succession of Don Carlos to the duchies of Parma and Tuscany. French diplomacy however was losing its military bite. Fleury&#x27;s cagey double game with the Corsican revolutionaries under Giacinto Paoli, smuggled arms to the island while assuring the Genoese of French support. Fleury thus began the manipulations that landed Corsica in the arms of France in 1768.

Fleury&#x27;s economies in the army and navy, as elsewhere, found the nation poorly prepared when in 1733 the War of the Polish Succession was forced upon France. He was compelled by court opinion to support the claims of Louis XV&#x27;s father-in-law Stanislaus Leszczynski to the Polish crown on the death of Augustus II, against the Russian and Austrian candidate; but the despatch of a French expedition to Gdańsk turned into a humiliation. Fleury was pressed by his advisor Germain Louis Chauvelin to more energetic measures; he concluded a close alliance with the Spanish Bourbons and sent armies against the Austrians twice. Military successes on the Rhine and in Italy secured the favorable terms of the treaty of Vienna (1735–1738). France had joined with the other powers in guaranteeing the succession of Maria Theresa under the Pragmatic Sanction. But by a diplomatic quibble, Fleury found an excuse on the death of Charles VI in 1740 for repudiating his engagements, when he found the party of war supreme in the king&#x27;s counsels. After the disasters of the Bohemian campaign at the outbreak of the War of the Austrian Succession he wrote in confidence a humble letter to the Habsburg general, Königsegg, who immediately published it. Fleury disavowed his own letter, and died in Issy-les-Moulineaux, a few days after the French evacuation of Prague on 20 January 1743.

He had enriched the royal library by many valuable oriental manuscripts, and was a member of the Académie Française from 1717, of the Academy of Sciences, and the Academy of Inscriptions.

In the years following Fleury&#x27;s death, escalating Franco-British skirmishes at sea culminated in a declaration of war with Britain in March 1744, a war he had avoided for so long, a war effectively ending the relatively peaceful period from 1713–1744, a period sometimes referred to the &quot;Thirty Years&#x27; Peace&quot; of which Cardinal Dubois and Philippe D&#x27;Orléans were the primary architects.

<doc id="327708" wikidata="Q553147" url="?curid=327708" title="Gordon B. Hinckley">
<text>Gordon Bitner Hinckley (June 23, 1910 – January 27, 2008) was an American religious leader and author who served as the 15th president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from March 1995 until his death in January 2008 at age 97. Considered a prophet, seer, and revelator by church members, Hinckley was the oldest person to preside over the church in its history until Russell M. Nelson surpassed his age in 2022.

Hinckley&#x27;s presidency was noted for the building of temples, with more than half of existing temples being built under his leadership. He also oversaw the reconstruction of the Nauvoo Illinois Temple and the building of the 21,000 seat Conference Center. During his tenure, &quot;The Family: A Proclamation to the World&quot; was issued and the Perpetual Education Fund was established. At the time of his death, approximately one-third of the church&#x27;s membership had joined the church under Hinckley&#x27;s leadership.

Hinckley was awarded ten honorary doctorate degrees, and in 2004 the Presidential Medal of Freedom by George W. Bush. He also received the Boy Scouts of America&#x27;s highest award, the Silver Buffalo, and served as chairman of the Church Boards of Trustees/Education. Hinckley died of natural causes on January 27, 2008. His wife, Marjorie Pay, died in 2004. He was succeeded as church president by Thomas S. Monson, who had served as his first counselor in the First Presidency, and, more importantly, was the President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles; according to LDS doctrine and practice, Monson was Hinckley&#x27;s anticipated successor.

==Early years==
Hinckley was born on June 23, 1910, in Salt Lake City, Utah, to prominent LDS writer and educator Bryant S. Hinckley and his wife Ada Bitner. He grew up on a residential farm in East Millcreek. His home library contained approximately 1,000 volumes of literature, philosophy and history. He graduated from LDS High School in 1928, then attended the University of Utah, where he majored in English literature and minored in Latin and ancient Greek, graduating with a B.A. in 1932. Hinckley became a missionary for the LDS Church, an unusual occurrence for Depression-era Latter-day Saints. He served in the London-based British Mission from 1933 to 1935. He later wrote the words for LDS hymn no. 135, &quot;My Redeemer Lives&quot;.

==Church employment==
Hinckley returned to the United States in 1935 after completing a short tour of the European continent, including preaching in both Berlin and Paris. He was given an assignment by his mission president, Joseph F. Merrill, to meet with the church&#x27;s First Presidency and request that better materials be made available to missionaries for proselytizing. As a result of this meeting, Hinckley received employment as executive secretary of the church&#x27;s Radio, Publicity and Missionary Literature Committee (he had received schooling as a journalist in college). Hinckley&#x27;s responsibilities included developing the church&#x27;s fledgling radio broadcasts and making use of the era&#x27;s new communication technologies.

One of the projects Hinckley oversaw in the late 1930s was development of the church&#x27;s exhibit for the Golden Gate International Exposition.

In 1935 Hinckley also worked as a seminary teacher for the Church Educational System. He however decided to focus solely on the work with the Radio, Publicity and missionary literature committee.

Starting in 1937, he served on the Sunday School General Board. After the Second World War, during which he left full-time LDS Church employ to work for a time with the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad, Hinckley served as executive secretary to the church&#x27;s Missionary Committee. He also served as the church&#x27;s liaison to Deseret Book, working with Deseret Book&#x27;s liaison to the church, Thomas S. Monson. At various times, especially in the late 1940s, Hinckley was also a reporter for the &quot;Church News&quot;, a publication of the &quot;Deseret News&quot;.

In the early 1950s, Hinckley was part of a committee that considered how to present the temple ordinances at the Swiss Temple. The concern was how this could be done when a need existed to provide them in at least 10 languages; the concern was eventually solved through the use of a film version of the endowment.

Hinckley&#x27;s background in journalism and public relations prepared him well to preside over the church during a time when it has received increasing media coverage. He had learned to use new technology to spread the word of God, developed positive relationships with people of other faiths, and studied and written works of Church history. These experiences would serve as a foundation for the service he would give for the rest of his life.

In 1957, Hinckley was named to the board of directors of KSL. Shortly after he was named to the executive committee of the board.

==Family==
On April 29, 1937, Hinckley married Marjorie Pay (November 23, 1911 – April 6, 2004) in the Salt Lake Temple. They had five children, including Richard G. Hinckley, an LDS Church general authority between 2005 and 2011, and Virginia Hinckley Pearce, a former member of the church&#x27;s Young Women general presidency.

Another of their daughters, Kathleen Hinckley Barnes Walker, co-authored several books with Virginia, and ran an events company. Her first husband, Alan Barnes, died in 2001 and in 2004 she married M. Richard Walker. The Walkers served from 2005 to 2008 as president and matron of the Salt Lake Temple and lived in Preston, England, from 2011 to 2013, while Richard served as president of the Missionary Training Center.

Hinckley&#x27;s other son, Clark, has also served in several church leadership positions, including stake president, president of the church&#x27;s Spain Barcelona Mission (2009 to 2012), and the first president of the Tijuana Mexico Temple (2015 to 2018).

== LDS Church service ==

===Local leadership===
After returning to East Millcreek at the end of employment with the railroad, Hinckley was called as a counselor in the presidency of the church&#x27;s East Millcreek Stake. He later served as president of that stake, until about six months after his call as an Assistant to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. During his time as stake president Hinckley oversaw the building of several chapels.

===General authority===
In the April 1958 general conference, Hinckley became a church general authority as an Assistant to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, a position that was later discontinued. One of his first assignments as a general authority was participating in the dedication the same month of the New Zealand Temple. In August 1958, Hinckley traveled to England, where he was involved in the London Temple open house and dedication. As a general authority, Hinckley continued to work with the missionary department, and after the death of Richards, he worked closely with Henry D. Moyle.

In early 1960, Hinckley was given responsibility for overseeing LDS Church operations in Asia. His first trip there in the spring of 1960 lasted two months and involved going to Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, and the Philippines. In the Philippines, he worked on getting government approval for missionaries to be sent. He returned to Asia on a second trip in April 1961, which included a meeting to inaugurate missionary work in the Philippines. During this trip he also was in Seoul, South Korea during the May 16 coup. Hinckley wired a story on the coup to the &quot;Deseret News&quot;.

In June 1961, Hinckley was one of the general authority presenters at the first Missionary President training seminar and was involved in the presentation of the first standardized missionary lesson plan.

In September 1961, Hinckley became an apostle in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. He filled a vacancy created by Hugh B. Brown being added to the First Presidency as the third counselor to David O. McKay.

After his call as an apostle, Hinckley continued to be a leader in the missionary department, with Boyd K. Packer serving as one of his key aides. Hinckley was also appointed the chair of the all-church coordinating council&#x27;s children&#x27;s section.

Hinckley also continued to oversee the church&#x27;s operations in Asia. In February 1962, he made the first trip to Asia on which he was accompanied by his wife, Marjorie. On the trip, they visited the Philippines, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea On his return, he held training seminars with missionaries in California and Illinois in co-operation with Moyle, and he later held training seminars in all 23 missions in Europe. The seminars were credited with being the main force behind higher rates of conversion over the coming summer.

Also in 1962, Hinckley was involved in the negotiations that lead to the LDS Church purchasing the shortwave radio station WRUL.

Meanwhile, Hinckley also dedicated a chapel in French Polynesia on the island of Huahine. A group of Latter-day Saints returned to their home island on their boat, which sank with 15 drowning. Hinckley canceled his return to Utah and took a voyage on a sailing vessel to preside at the funeral.

In late 1963, Hinckley made another tour of the Philippines, Japan and South Korea, this time bringing not only his wife but also their 10-year-old daughter. In the spring of 1964, the &quot;Improvement Era&quot; published a series or articles on the church in Asia and identified Hinckley as president of the &quot;Hawaiian-Oriental Missions.&quot;

In 1964, Hinckley was appointed a board member of KIRO-TV and KIRO-AM/FM, which the LDS Church had just purchased. When the church formed Bonneville International Corporation later in 1964, Hinckley was named a vice president, a member of the board of directors, and a member of the executive committee.

Hinckley circumnavigated the world on a trip with his wife in late 1964. He first stopped in Tokyo for a missionary conference. He then traveled to South Korea, Hong Kong, and the Philippines, as he had before. Next, he went to Thailand and held a meeting with the few church members, all of whom expatriates, in the country at the time. Hinckley then traveled to Saigon and met with about 60 church members, mostly American military personnel. There were two Vietnamese citizens who had joined the LDS Church at the meeting in Saigon. Finally, he visited Singapore and then went to India.

In India, he went to Madras and then Coimbatore, where Hinckley met Paul Thirithuvodoss, who had written to the church headquarters to ask for baptism. Hinckley went to Medukerai to see a school run by Thirithuvodoss. Hinckley decided not to baptize Thirithuvodoss at the time.

The Hinckleys then traveled to Beirut, where they met with a small group of church members, and then on to Jerusalem. From there, they traveled to Greece, where they met with another small group of church members. They then proceeded to Frankfurt, where they stayed in the home of Ezra Taft Benson, who presided the European Mission, and his wife, Flora. The Hinckleys then went to Brussels before they returned to Utah.

In July 1965, Hinckley went to Hawaii, where he was involved with the first LDS temple services in Japanese.

Also in 1965, Hinckley was involved in negotiations with United States Selective Service officials that led to the establishment of a quota of one LDS missionary, who would otherwise be drafted, being able to leave from a ward or branch every six months, with the quota transferable within any given LDS district or stake.

In the late 1960s, Hinckley was a key person in formulating official LDS Church statements, such as the 1968 statement on the sale of liquor by the drink.

In the early 1970s, Hinckley served as chair of the executive committee of the Church Board of Education.

In 1972, Hinckley became the initial head of the LDS Church&#x27;s public affairs department. In September 1972, Hinckley and his wife traveled with church president Harold B. Lee and his wife, Joan, on a tour of the United Kingdom, Greece, Israel, and Italy. The visit included meetings with church members in Rome; a group of LDS youth at an event at the Santa Severa resort on the coast of the Tyrrhenian Sea; and meetings with Church members in Florence, Pisa and Milan. In Milan, they held a press conference, which was attended by only one journalist, Michele Straniero. He interviewed Lee and Hinckley for an hour and not only published work in &quot;La Stampa&quot; from the interview but also used it as the starting point to a book on Mormonism that he later wrote.

Also in the 1970s, Hinckley had supervisory assignments for the church in South America and later in Europe. He served on the church&#x27;s executive committees for temples, missionary work, welfare services, priesthood, and the military.

Hinckley was the chair of the executive committee over the 1980 commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the organization of the LDS Church.

===Member of First Presidency===
On July 23, 1981, Spencer W. Kimball appointed Hinckley as a counselor in the First Presidency. After first counselor N. Eldon Tanner died in 1982, Kimball did not appoint a new counselor. As the 1980s progressed, more of the day-to-day affairs of the First Presidency fell to the healthier Hinckley. By 1984, Hinckley was the only publicly-active member of the First Presidency.

In 1984, the church formed Area Presidencies. Until then, church headquarters administered national and multinational areas. The Area Presidencies decentralized administration with presidencies living in locations around the world.

During his time in Kimball&#x27;s presidency, Hinckley presided over the dedication of 16 LDS temples. Among them was the Manila Philippines Temple. Hinckley dedicated it 18 years after he had dedicated the first Philippine LDS chapel. At the time of Kimball&#x27;s death, Hinckley had dedicated nearly half of the then 36 temples.

After Kimball&#x27;s death in November 1985, Ezra Taft Benson became President of the Church. Benson named Hinckley as first counselor and Thomas S. Monson as second counselor. In the early 1990s, Benson developed serious health problems, which removed him from public view. Hinckley and Monson carried out many of the duties of the First Presidency until Benson died in 1994.

During the presidencies of Kimball and Benson, most of the new temples dedicated were dedicated by Hinckley. When Benson died in 1994, about half of all operating temples had been dedicated by Hinckley.

Meanwhile, the Mark Hofmann document forgeries, bombings, and investigation occurred. &quot;The news interest was global&quot; and &quot;the whole episode achieved epic proportions.&quot; Several books describe the acquisition of supposed historical documents by Hinckley and others such as the secret sale of the Stowell document describing Joseph Smith&#x27;s &quot;money-digging pursuits.&quot; Using $15,000 of church funds, Hinckley bought the document from Hofmann. Two years later, Hofmann leaked its existence to the Mormon history community. Upon press inquiries, Hinckley acknowledged the document and released it. Later, bombing investigators proved that Hofmann had forged the document.

In 1992, Hinckley made an official visit to Rome and he presented a copy of the &quot;Encyclopedia of Mormonism&quot; to the Vatican.

After Benson&#x27;s death, Howard W. Hunter became president and retained Hinckley and Monson as counselors in the First Presidency. With Hunter as President of the Church, the title of President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles fell to Hinckley because he was the second-most senior Apostle after Hunter.

===President of the Church===

When Hunter died after a presidency of nine months, Hinckley succeeded to the presidency of the church at the age of 84 on March 12, 1995. Hinckley immediately showed a change in approach and tone from his predecessors by making the meeting with the press. There, his call was announced at an actual press conference, and reporters were invited to ask questions, which sent the reporters scrambling to figure out what they would actually ask. On November 2, 2006, Hinckley surpassed David O. McKay to become the oldest LDS Church president in history.

Hinckley was known for accelerating the building of temples. When he became president, there were 47 operating temples in the church. At the time of his death, there were 124, over two thirds of which had been dedicated or rededicated under Hinckley, with 14 others announced or under construction. Hinckley oversaw other significant building projects, including the construction of the Conference Center and extensive renovations of the Salt Lake Tabernacle.

On September 23, 1995, Hinckley released &quot;The Family: A Proclamation to the World,&quot; a statement of belief and counsel regarding the sanctity of the family and marriage; it was prepared by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve. In February 1996, there were more church members outside than inside the United States. Also in 1996, &quot;60 Minutes&quot; aired an interview of Hinckley by Mike Wallace during a segment on the LDS Church. In 1998, Hinckley was a guest on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Larry King Live&quot;. Until his death, Hinckley maintained a friendship with both Wallace and Larry King.

In November 2000, Hinckley spoke to the youth of the church and gave them six traits to work on, named the &quot;Six Be&#x27;s&quot; (Be Grateful, Be Smart, Be Clean, Be True, Be Humble, Be Prayerful), which were first introduced in his &quot;New York Times&quot; Bestseller &quot;Standing for Something&quot; and later expanded on in &quot;Way to Be&quot;.

On March 31, 2001, Hinckley announced the creation of the Perpetual Education Fund, an endowment that provides loans to students in developing nations. On October 22, 2002, Hinckley participated in the dedication of the Gordon B. Hinckley Building at Brigham Young University–Idaho in Rexburg, Idaho. That was the first building at BYU–Idaho to be named for a living church president.
In April 2003, Hinckley gave a sermon that addressed the ongoing War in Afghanistan and the Iraq War, which had started just two weeks earlier. He said that &quot;as citizens we are all under the direction of our respective national leaders. They have access to greater political and military intelligence than do the people generally. He added, &quot;Furthermore, we are a freedom-loving people, committed to the defense of liberty wherever it is in jeopardy.&quot; He also noted, &quot;It may even be that [the Lord] will hold us responsible if we try to impede or hedge up the way of those who are involved in a contest with forces of evil and repression.&quot;

In March 2005, Hinckley, together with Thomas S. Monson and James E. Faust, celebrated their tenth anniversary as the First Presidency, the second time in the history of the church that a First Presidency had continued for such a period of time without personnel changes (the first time occurring between October 1934 and May 1945, when J. Reuben Clark and David O. McKay served as counselors to Heber J. Grant).

On January 24, 2006, Hinckley underwent surgery to remove cancerous growths from his large intestine. He was also then diagnosed with diabetes. In June 2006, Hinckley traveled to Iowa City, Iowa, to speak at a commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the start of the Mormon handcart companies. On June 23, 2006, his 96th birthday, Hinckley participated in a groundbreaking ceremony at Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah, for a new building that was to be named in his honor. The building was named the Gordon B. Hinckley Alumni and Visitors Center and was completed and dedicated on Hinckley&#x27;s 97th birthday.

On March 31, 2007, Hinckley rededicated the Salt Lake Tabernacle after extensive renovation. One of Hinckley&#x27;s last public appearances was on January 4, 2008, when he offered the prayer at the rededication of the Utah State Capitol. His final public appearance was a week before his death, the dedication of the Garden Park Ward building on January 20, 2008.
During his tenure as president, Hinckley gave over 2,000 speeches. He traveled nearly a million miles over a lifetime to more than 160 countries, as he met with church members and dedicated meetinghouses and temples.

Hinckley&#x27;s annual speeches at BYU were the subject of a study by the National Center for Voice and Speech at the University of Utah to analyze how the human voice changes with age. The 36 speeches by Hinckley that were analyzed ranged from 1958, when he was 47–48, to 2007, the year prior to his death. The study showed how his voice started dropping in pitch in his 50s and continued until he was 70, when he began to develop a higher, thinner &quot;old person&quot; voice. By his 80s, his voice became increasingly wavery and the rate of his speech began to slow, and by his 90s, he would slur words. Hinckley was a good subject for the study, as the annual addresses were meticulously recorded and transcribed; in addition, he did not smoke, drink, sing, or engage in other activities that would put unnatural strain on his voice.

===Temple dedications===
When Hinckley became president, he had dedicated 23 of the church&#x27;s 47 temples and had rededicated four of the remaining 24. As president, Hinckley presided at the dedication of 65 additional temples. Hinckley also rededicated five temples while president of the church, four of which he had dedicated initially. In all, Hinckley dedicated or rededicated 92 different temples, 70 of which as president of the church, at 97 different dedicatory services.

==Awards==

On June 23, 2004 (Hinckley&#x27;s 94th birthday), U.S. President George W. Bush awarded Hinckley the Presidential Medal of Freedom in a ceremony at the White House. The press release put forth by the White House stated: &quot;Gordon B. Hinckley ... has inspired millions and has led efforts to improve humanitarian aid, disaster relief, and education funding across the globe.&quot;

Hinckley received many educational honors, including the Distinguished Citizen Award from Southern Utah University, Distinguished Alumni Award from the University of Utah, and 10 honorary doctorates from schools including Westminster College, Utah State University, Utah Valley University, University of Utah, Brigham Young University, Brigham Young University–Idaho, Weber State University, and Southern Utah University. He received the Silver Buffalo Award, which is the highest honor bestowed by the Boy Scouts of America, and was honored by the National Conference for Community and Justice for his contributions to tolerance and understanding in the world. In 1996, Hinckley received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member and philanthropist Jon Huntsman Sr.

==Death and legacy==

On January 27, 2008, Hinckley died at the age of 97 while surrounded by family in his Salt Lake City apartment. According to a church spokesman, the death was due to &quot;causes incident to age.&quot; The &quot;Deseret Morning News&quot; reported that Hinckley had just gone through a treatment of chemotherapy a few days earlier, and had &quot;worked until the very end.&quot; The day following Hinckley&#x27;s death, thousands of LDS youth in six states organized a social network campaign to dress in &quot;Sunday Best&quot; to honor Hinckley. Funeral services were held on February 2, 2008, at the Conference Center in Salt Lake City, which was attended by tens of thousands. 
Hinckley was buried at the Salt Lake City Cemetery next to his wife, who had died almost four years earlier. Some of the soil that was used to bury him was imported from the grounds of the Preston England Temple in Lancashire; this was done because Hinckley had been a missionary in this region of England. Hinckley was succeeded as president by Thomas S. Monson on February 3, 2008.

In 2012, a 50-year longitudinal study of the development of Hinckley&#x27;s voice, based on addresses he gave at BYU, was published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society. The study gave insight into the changes in the voices of aging adults.

Hinckley&#x27;s teachings as an apostle were the 2017 course of study in the LDS Church&#x27;s Sunday Relief Society and Melchizedek priesthood classes.

==History==
This part of the future state of Veracruz was brought under Aztec sway in or around 1450 under Emperor Moctezuma Ilhuicamina. Following the Spanish conquest of Mexico, the area was awarded to the conquistador Ojeda el Tuerto. Ojeda introduced sugar cane into the area, and the San Juan Bautista Nogales sugar mill – one of the earliest, if not the very first on the American continent – was later established there.

In 1627, Rodrigo de Viveros y Aberrucia, owner of the sugar mill at the time, was named the First Count of the Valley of Orizaba by Philip III of Spain.

In 1910, the city of Nogales was awarded the status of a town (&quot;villa&quot;) and, in 1971, city status (&quot;ciudad&quot;).

<text>Frank Stagg (October 20, 1911 – June 2, 2001) was a Southern Baptist theologian, seminary professor, author, and pastor over a 50-year ministry career. He taught New Testament interpretation and Greek at New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary from 1945 until 1964 and at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky from 1964 until 1978. His publications, recognitions and honors earned him distinction as one of the eminent theologians of the past century. Other eminent theologians have honored him as a &quot;Teaching Prophet.&quot;

==Personal==

Dr. Frank Stagg was born October 20, 1911, on his grandfather&#x27;s rice farm near the small community of Eunice, Louisiana. Although the family name comes from an English ancestor, the Stagg family was of French Catholic descent, commonly called Cajuns. His grandfather and his uncle were the first of the Staggs to become Evangelical Christians. His uncle became a preacher who ministered in the native &quot;Cajun&quot; dialect. Frank was proud of his Louisiana French heritage and of his upbringing in the home of a Baptist deacon and Sunday School teacher.

In his junior year at Louisiana College, Frank met his wife: Evelyn Owen of Ruston, Louisiana, who would become an integral part of his future endeavors. They married in 1935 and raised three children—Ted, Bob and Ginger.

==Beliefs==

Counted among the &quot;best-known progressive activists,&quot; Stagg addressed a variety of contemporary issues. These included civil rights, gender equity, Vietnam, the First Gulf War, ecumenism and aging. He also argued for the Bible&#x27;s relevance. &quot;The Bible is relevant,&quot; Stagg said. &quot;We don&#x27;t have to make it relevant.&quot; He said that the First Gulf War presented the ideal opportunity for Southern Baptists to &quot;reassess and reject&quot; the just war doctrine and embrace pacifism as the appropriate Christian response to all wars. He opposed Reformed points of doctrine such as predestination and other Calvinist beliefs in Southern Baptist life.

==Library collection==

Through the years, Dr. Stagg amassed an extensive library and wealth of knowledge and scholarship in the form of correspondence, writings, articles, speeches, commentaries, book reviews, photographs, sermon notes and even private musings. &quot;The Papers of Dr. Frank Stagg, 1938–1999&quot; now reside at Samford University in Birmingham, Alabama. The represent more than a half century of his life&#x27;s journey and Christian pilgrimage. His collection shares prominence in the library with the manuscript collection of English theologian and preacher Charles Spurgeon.

==Recognition and honors==

Frank Stagg is included in various lists of distinguished twentieth century Baptist theologians: E. Y. Mullins, W. T. Connor, W. O. Carver, Frank Stagg, W. W. Stevens, Dale Moody, Dallas Roark, James Wm. McClendon, Morris Ashcraft, E. Frank Tupper, Warren McWilliams, A. J. Conyers, and Curtis Freeman. He also has been called &quot;one of the foremost interpreters of the New Testament among Baptists in the twentieth century.&quot;

At the Louisville seminary he held the prestigious James Buchanan Harrison Chair of New Testament Theology.

The Stagg-Tolbert Forum for Biblical Studies is an annual event named in his honor. It is designed to make excellence in biblical scholarship accessible to the lay person.

<text>Morris Island is an 840-acre (3.4 km2) uninhabited island in Charleston Harbor in South Carolina, accessible only by boat. The island lies in the outer reaches of the harbor and was thus a strategic location in the American Civil War. The island is part of the cities of Charleston and Folly Beach, in Charleston County.

==History==
On January 9, 1861, the first shots of the American Civil War were fired from cannons by cadets of The Citadel at the &quot;Star of the West&quot; as the ship tried to resupply Fort Sumter.

Morris Island was heavily fortified to defend Charleston Harbor, with the fortifications centered on Fort Wagner. Battery Gregg was also on the island. Morris Island had heavy fighting during the Union Army&#x27;s campaign to capture Charleston, and is perhaps best known today as the scene of the ill-fated assault by the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, an African-American regiment. The regiment and this assault, where it suffered over 50% casualties, was immortalized in the film &quot;Glory&quot;.

After the Confederates abandoned Morris Island in 1863, the Union occupied it. In the next year, they transferred 600 Confederate officers from Fort Delaware to Morris Island, 50 of whom were quickly exchanged. The others were utilized as human shields in an attempt to silence the Confederate artillery at Fort Sumter; in reaction to what the Confederacy did with POWs in Charleston to deter Union ships from firing on the city. None of these men were killed by artillery fire though several died of sickness. They soon became known in the South as the Immortal Six Hundred.

Beach erosion has destroyed any trace of the original fortifications on the island, including Fort Wagner.
==Morris Island Light==
Morris Island home to Morris Island Light, a lighthouse that stands on the southern side of the entrance to Charleston Harbor, north of the town of Folly Beach.

==Ownership and preservation==
Plans to commercially develop the 125 acres (506,000 m2) of high ground on the northern tip of Morris Island as a luxury residential area resulted in several groups fighting to have the island declared a national historical park or added to Fort Sumter and Fort Moultrie National Historical Park.

In January 2005, Charleston developer Harry Huffman, listed the for sale on eBay for $12.5 million. Huffman was in negotiations to sell the island to a consortium of preservation groups, but claimed to have listed the island to see if there was any other interest. Huffman had waged a number of battles with the local development agencies to increase the zoning, which limited construction to five homes, but claimed to have grown tired of fighting and just wanted to sell.

On February 2, 2006, the Trust for Public Land (TPL), a non-profit private land conservation organization, announced the purchase of Morris Island for $4.5 million. Ginn Resorts had previously purchased the island for a reported $6.5 million. In May 2008, TPL and partners, including the South Carolina Conservation Bank, the South Carolina State Ports Authority, the American Battlefield Trust (then known as the Civil War Trust) and many private donors, purchased the island on behalf of the City of Charleston from Ginn Resorts for $3 million. In 2003, when a builder announced his plans to build houses on the tract, for which he had an option to buy, the Trust, local preservationist Blake Hallman and others formed the Morris Island Coalition, generated media attention and support for preservation and defeated the effort. Ginn Resorts was interested in developing the property, too, but ultimately decided to purchase it and then immediately sell it to the preservationists. According to TPL, the city and county are working &quot;to complete a management plan to protect the island&#x27;s nationally significant historical and natural resources.&quot;
==In Fiction==
In the novel series Virals, by Kathy Reichs, the main characters all live on Morris Island.

<text>Nine-Mile Prairie (named for its location west and north of downtown Lincoln) is a tract of conserved tallgrass prairie in Lancaster County, Nebraska, United States. Except for one small portion of it that was farmed as recently as the 1950s, Nine-Mile Prairie has never been plowed (some of the land has at times been grazed as recently as the 1960s). As such, it is one of the largest areas of virgin tallgrass prairie in the state of Nebraska. A 228-acre portion has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as Nine-Mile Prairie, since 1986.

The area was previously owned by the Department of Defense and served as part of a fenced buffer zone around a World War II era bomb storage depot. It was later sold to the City of Lincoln, then from 1966 on managed by the Lincoln Airport Authority, then in 1983 transferred to the University Foundation.

Nine-Mile Prairie is now administered by the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. The university uses it for a variety of research and recreational purposes, especially for studies of prairie ecology. Research on this prairie began in the 1920s when Professor John Ernest Weaver and his students started using it for their studies of prairie plant ecology.

In addition to prairie grasses, some of which including big bluestem (&quot;Andropogon gerardii&quot;) can grow as tall as six feet, the site supports a range of prairie trees, including cottonwoods and honey locust. Invasive sumac plants and (in the absence of fire) eastern juniper trees require control to preserve the original prairie ecology. A total of 392 species of vascular plants and 80 species of birds have been observed at Nine Mile Prairie. Notable species include the federally threatened prairie white fringed orchid (&quot;Platanthera praeclara&quot;) and the rare regal fritillary butterfly (&quot;Speyeria idalia&quot;), and it is home to bluebirds and white-tailed deer; herds of bison would have also passed through the site when it was open prairie until the mid-19th century.
