<text>Calendar Girls is a 2003 British comedy film directed by Nigel Cole. Produced by Touchstone Pictures, it features a screenplay by Tim Firth and Juliette Towhidi, based on a true story of a group of middle-aged Yorkshire women who produced a nude calendar to raise money for Leukaemia Research (subsequently Blood Cancer UK) under the auspices of the Women&#x27;s Institutes in April 1999 after the husband of one of their members dies from cancer. The film stars an ensemble cast headed by Helen Mirren and Julie Walters, with Linda Bassett, Annette Crosbie, Celia Imrie, Penelope Wilton, Geraldine James, Harriet Thorpe and Philip Glenister playing key supporting roles.

&quot;Calendar Girls&quot; premiered at the Locarno Film Festival and was later shown at Filmfest Hamburg, the Dinard Festival of British Cinema in France, the Warsaw Film Festival, the Tokyo International Film Festival and the UK Film Festival in Hong Kong. It garnered generally positive reactions by film critics, who compared it with another British comedy film &quot;The Full Monty&quot; (1997). At a budget of $10 million it also became a major commercial success, eventually grossing $93.4 million worldwide following its theatrical release in the U.S. In addition, the picture was awarded the British Comedy Award for Best Comedy Film, and received ALFS Award, Empire Award and Satellite Award nominations for Mirren and Walters, and a Golden Globe Award nomination for Mirren.

==Plot==
Annie Clarke and Chris Harper live in the Yorkshire village of Knapely, where they spend much time at the local Women&#x27;s Institute and with each other. When Annie&#x27;s husband, John, is diagnosed with terminal leukaemia, Chris regularly visits them at the hospital.

Chris complains about the uncomfortable couch in the waiting room. After noticing a &quot;girlie&quot; calendar in a local mechanic&#x27;s shop, she hits upon an idea to raise funds to buy a new sofa. She proposes producing a calendar featuring members of the Knapely branch of the Women&#x27;s Institute discreetly posing nude while engaged in traditional WI activities, such as baking and knitting.

Chris&#x27;s proposal initially is met with skepticism, but she eventually convinces nine additional women to participate in the project with her and Annie. They enlist Lawrence, a hospital worker and amateur photographer, to help with the project. The women are all quite shy, but they support each other, overcoming their fears.

The head of the local Women&#x27;s Institute branch refuses to sanction the calendar, so Chris and Annie plead their case to the national congress of the Women&#x27;s Institute in London. They are told the final decision rests with the local leader, who grudgingly agrees to the calendar&#x27;s sale.

The initial printing of 500 quickly sells out and gains national and international media attention. The women are invited, all expenses paid, to appear on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; in Los Angeles. Initially Chris is convinced to not go, to watch after her troubled teen by Annie, but a scandalous story about her in a gossip rag by a paparazzi-journalist causes her to follow them to L.A.

The publicity surrounding the calendar eventually takes a toll on their personal lives and, during a photo shoot, tension boils over, Chris and Annie angrily clash. Annie accuses Chris of ignoring her husband and son and the demands of the family business in favour of newfound celebrity; Chris believes Annie revels in her Mother Teresa-like status of catering to the ill and bereaved who have bombarded her with fan mail.

All is resolved eventually, and the women resume their normal, pre-calendar lives.

Before the credits, it is shown that they made over half a million pounds with the calendars, and with the proceeds built a special leukemia wing on their local hospital.

==Cast==
* Helen Mirren as Chris Harper, the driving force behind the idea of stripping off for the local Women&#x27;s Institute calendar. 
* Julie Walters as Annie Clarke, Chris&#x27;s best friend whose husband John&#x27;s death from leukemia serves as the basis for her friend&#x27;s idea to purchase a sofa for hospital visitors in remembrance of him. 
* Linda Bassett as Cora, a shop owner and divorced single mother. She is the official pianist of the Knapely WI.
* Annette Crosbie as Jessie, a retired teacher.
* Celia Imrie as Celia, a major&#x27;s wife.
* Penelope Wilton as Ruth Reynoldson, a carpet dealer&#x27;s housewife. Wilton initially rejected the offer to join the project as she refused to be filmed semi-naked.
* Geraldine James as Marie, chairwoman of the Knapely WI group.
* Philip Glenister as Lawrence Sertain, John Clarke&#x27;s nurse and photographer of the calendar, based on photographer Terry Logan.
* Ciarán Hinds as Rod Harper, Chris&#x27;s husband, a florist.
* John Alderton as John Clarke, Annie&#x27;s husband, who dies from leukaemia.
* George Costigan as Eddie Reynoldson, Ruth&#x27;s husband. He generally shows little affection for Ruth and ultimately bashes her participation in the calendar. Ruth later leaves him when he has an affair with a woman whom he introduced himself to as a widower.
* John-Paul Macleod as Jem Harper, Chris and Rod&#x27;s son.

==Production==
===Inspiration===
The fundraising phenomenon of the Calendar Girls was inspired by the death of Angela Baker&#x27;s husband John Richard Baker, an Assistant National Park Officer for the Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority, who died from non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, a form of blood cancer at the age of 54 in 1998. During his illness, Baker&#x27;s friends began to raise money, initially with the aim of purchasing a sofa for the visitors&#x27; lounge in the hospital where John was treated. Nothing could have prepared them for the way their original calendar took off. To date, they have raised over £3 million for Leukaemia &amp; Lymphoma Research (now Blood Cancer UK), the UK&#x27;s leading blood cancer charity.

The photos for the 2000 Alternative WI Calendar, as it was named, were taken by Terry Logan, a former professional photographer who was married to one of the models. It was released on 12 April 1999 and became a runaway success, selling out in the first week. 10,000 additional copies were printed, all of which were sold within three weeks. Nine months after its launch, the calendar had sold 88,000 copies. It then was adapted for a US version covering June 2000 – December 2001. The ladies were invited to appear with Jay Leno and Rosie O&#x27;Donnell on their respective talk shows. That year the calendar sold 202,000 copies, with its proceeds being used to fund lymphoma and leukaemia research in new laboratories at the University of Leeds.

Since 2000, the Calendar Girls have produced calendars for 2004, 2005, 2007 and a recipe calendar for 2008 with their favourite Yorkshire recipes on the back of each month. Ten years on, they launched a 2010 calendar with a new set of full colour images and the aim of raising £2 million for Leukaemia &amp; Lymphoma Research. In addition, they have released a range of merchandise in aid of the charity throughout the years.

===Development===
Six of the eleven women who were pictured in the original calendar sold the rights to their stories, including Angela Baker, Tricia Stewart, Beryl Bamforth, Lynda Logan, Christine Clancy and Ros Fawcett. Screenwriter Juliette Towhidi first came across the story when she was shown an article in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and she straight away took the idea to producer Suzanne Mackie. The two of them had been discussing ideas for a female-driven film for a while, and this struck them as the perfect project. They travelled up to Yorkshire together to meet the women, and were able to secure life story rights in the face of fierce competition, including from Hollywood. Towhidi then worked on multiple drafts of the screenplay, getting to know the women and developing the script over several years. In this time the film&#x27;s working title switched from &#x27;Calendar Girls&#x27; to &#x27;Jam and Jerusalem&#x27; and back again. A first director was attached, but when he dropped out, so Nigel Cole, known for his screen debut &quot;Saving Grace&quot; starring Brenda Blethyn, was brought on board, quickly followed by screenwriter Tim Firth, who took over writing duties from Towhidi and worked on rewrites of the script up until production.

Cole approached Julie Walters and Helen Mirren to play the lead roles in the film. Both actresses had been aware of the WI calendar backstory. Based on Baker, Walters was Cole&#x27;s first choice to play the &quot;more quiet and sensitive&quot; role of Annie. Known for her comedic roles, Walters initially thought Cole had accidentally offered her the wrong part, and although pleased to have been cast against stereotype, she considered the role &quot;a difficult path to trap&quot; while striking a balance between Annie&#x27;s grief and humorous moments. As a result, she was heavily involved in the modification of several scenes. Mirren was initially hesitant to sign on to the project because she considered it &quot;too English&quot; and disliked the idea of a &quot;poor woman&#x27;s &quot;Full Monty&quot;.&quot; Upon learning that Walters and other colleagues had signed on, however, she rethought her original decision and accepted the offer. Modelled after Stewart, Mirren has described Chris as a &quot;dash in&quot;—character who shared similarities with Stewart but was actually not based on her real persona. Anne Reid was also offered a major role in &quot;Calendar Girls&quot;, but choose to do Roger Michell&#x27;s &quot;The Mother&quot; (2003) instead. With &quot;Calendar Girls&quot; being rare for a film to focus on middle-aged women, while not just portraying them as mothers or aunts, Cole experienced difficulties with casting the male roles: &quot;several actors disliked the idea of being subsidiary to women.&quot;

===Filming===
 Filming took place in the summer of 2002. Whereas the actual Calendar Girls were members of the Rylstone Women&#x27;s Institute, much of the film was shot in and around the village of Kettlewell in North Yorkshire, some ten miles away, which stood in for the fictional village of Knapely. Additional locations include Buckden, Burnsall, Conistone, Ilkley, Settle, Linton, Malham, Skipton, Westminster and Ealing in London, and the beach in Santa Monica, USA. The penultimate shot of lead characters Chris and Annie walking down a street was filmed in Turville. Interiors were filmed in the Shepperton Studios in Surrey.

The pictures in the film-version calendar were taken by professional stills photographer Jaap Buitendijk. Filming of the nude scenes took a week. According to Cole, the actors were struck by group spirit when they met their real-life counterparts from the Women&#x27;s Institute and experienced the supportive atmosphere that had got them all through the embarrassment of taking their clothes off to make a calendar. That same spirit started to show on set, with the cast becoming determined to be nude, even when it was not requested for filming, including face shots. It was suggested that Phillip Glennister&#x27;s character says to Celia Imrie&#x27;s character &quot;You look beautiful Celia&quot; he was aiming it at Celia Imrie herself as support. While Cole and his team placed vegetables strategically for shooting, bits kept showing through and they had to reshoot several scenes. However, a young man from digital remastering had to spend four weeks removing all the private parts in post-production. The actors were very supportive of each other, with a bottle of champagne waiting whenever anyone finished their nude scene.

===Music===
Hollywood Records was announced as the distributor of the soundtrack album for &quot;Calendar Girls&quot; which featured sixteen songs, including &quot;You Upset Me Baby&quot; performed by B.B. King, &quot;Sloop John B&quot; by the Beach Boys, &quot;The Way You Do the Things You Do&quot; by The Temptations, and &quot;Comin&#x27; Home Baby&quot; by Roland Kirk and Quincy Jones. It was released on 9 December 2003 in the United Kingdom.

==Reception==
The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 74% of critics gave the film a positive rating, based on 126 reviews, with an average score of 6.5/10. Its consensus states &quot;A charming, but clichéd comedy reminiscent of &quot;The Full Monty&quot;.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 60 out of 100, based on reviews from 30 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;A−&quot; on scale of A to F.
Ruthe Stein, writing for &quot;The San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, said it is &quot;A charming movie [that] should appeal to fans of &quot;The Full Monty&quot; and &quot;Waking Ned Devine&quot; – and not just because they also featured nudity that made you smile instead of smirk. The films share a wonderfully British wry humor. They&#x27;re not laugh-out-loud funny, but there&#x27;s quite a bit to amuse you when thinking about the scenes later.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; said, &quot;It&#x27;s the kind of sweet, good-humored comedy that used to star Margaret Rutherford, although Helen Mirren and Julie Walters, its daring top-liners, would have curled Dame Margaret&#x27;s eyebrows [...] That the movie works, and it does, is mostly because of the charm of Mirren and Walters, who show their characters having so much fun that it becomes infectious.&quot;

In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Elvis Mitchell called &quot;minty-cool&quot; Helen Mirren and &quot;deft&quot; Julie Walters &quot;a graceful pair of troupers&quot; and &quot;a sunny, amusing team.&quot; He described the film as &quot;yet another professionally acted and staged wry-crisp comedy about British modesty [...] that gets its laughs, but seems increasingly out of date [...] When the biggest compliment you can pay a picture is that it is professional and not smug, there&#x27;s a little something missing, like invention.&quot; Manohla Dargis of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said the film &quot;is closer in texture and consistency to individually wrapped American cheese than good, tangy English Cheddar. But even humble plastic-wrapped cheese has its virtues and so does this film [...] Chief among those graces are Helen Mirren and Julie Walters, two well-matched and criminally underused actresses [...] Although they have little to do but grin and bare it, Mirren and Walters are delightful company.&quot;

In &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Lisa Schwarzbaum, who graded the film B+, compared &quot;Calendar Girls&quot; with other British comedy films such as &quot;Billy Elliot&quot; and &quot;Saving Grace&quot;. She commented that &quot;[It] is the first export from the light-comedy-steamroller division of the British film industry that avoids, for the most part, the kind of queasy class condescension such hell-bent charmers have relied on since unemployed steel-mill workers shook their groove thangs in &quot;The Full Monty&quot;.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; critic Derek Elley wrote that the film &quot;delivers very likable, if sometimes dramatically wobbly, results&quot;. He found that &quot;though the film is never dull, and playing by the cast is spirited, it&#x27;s actually a surprisingly gentle movie [...] The humor has a typically British, offhanded flavor, and the essentially simple story plays more as a multi-character rondo on a single idea. For every laugh-out-loud moment, or eccentric touch, there are equal moments of reflection and pause [...] Despite an uncertain start in establishing a consistent comic tone, pic builds into an engaging, light character comedy, played somewhere between the Ealing tradition and contempo regional comedy.&quot;

In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Peter Bradshaw rated the film three out of a possible five stars and added, &quot;This genial comedy, directed by Nigel Cole, with an excellent, tightly constructed script by Tim Firth and Juliette Towhidi, accentuates the positive. There&#x27;s lots of wit and pluck and not much heartbreak,&quot; and Mark Kermode of &quot;The Observer&quot; said, &quot;When the film succeeds, as it does magnificently in the first two-thirds, one can only marvel at the miracle of a world in which such plotlines could literally land on a producer&#x27;s doorstep with the morning papers. When it fails, it is the film&#x27;s acknowledgment of its own big-screen inevitability that is to blame. The result is half a great British screen comedy, twice as much as one usually expects from the genre nowadays ... Ultimately, however, this remains an immensely likeable and often impressive romp.&quot;

<doc id="326992" wikidata="Q478537" url="?curid=326992" title="The Nigger of the &quot;Narcissus&quot;">
<text>The Nigger of the &quot;Narcissus&quot;: A Tale of the Forecastle (sometimes subtitled A Tale of the Sea), first published in the United States as The Children of the Sea, is an 1897 novella by Polish-British novelist Joseph Conrad. The central character is an Afro-Caribbean man who is ill at sea while aboard the trading ship &quot;Narcissus&quot; heading towards London. Due to the offensiveness of the word &quot;nigger&quot; in the title, it was renamed &quot;The Children of the Sea: A Tale of the Forecastle&quot; for the 1897 US edition. 

Some critics have described the novella as marking the start of Conrad&#x27;s &quot;major&quot; or &quot;middle&quot; period; others have placed it as the best work of his early period.

==Preface==

Conrad&#x27;s preface to the novel, regarded as a manifesto of literary impressionism, is considered one of his most significant pieces of nonfiction writing. It begins with the line: &quot;A work that aspires, however humbly, to the condition of art should carry its justification in every line&quot;.

==Plot==

The title character, James Wait, is a dying West Indian black sailor on board the merchant ship &quot;Narcissus&quot;, on which he finds passage from Bombay to London. Suffering from tuberculosis, Wait becomes seriously ill almost from the outset, arousing the sympathies of many. The ship&#x27;s white master, Captain Allistoun, and an old white sailor named Singleton remain concerned primarily with their duties and appear indifferent to Wait&#x27;s condition. Rounding the Cape of Good Hope, the ship capsizes onto her beam-ends during a sudden gale and half her hull is submerged, with many of the crew&#x27;s rations and personal belongings lost; the men cling onto the deck for an entire night and day, waiting in silence for the ship to turn over the rest of the way and sink. Allistoun refuses to allow the masts to be severed, which might allow the hull to right itself but would prevent the ship from making use of her sails. Five of the men, realizing that Wait is unaccounted for, climb down to his cabin and rescue him at their own peril. When the storm passes and the wind returns, Allistoun directs the weary men to catch the wind, which succeeds in righting the ship.

The voyage resumes but eventually drifts into the doldrums, where the headwinds diminish and the ship is becalmed for many days. Rations grow even scarcer and the men become anxious to return home. Wait eventually confesses to a lazy Cockney sailor named Donkin that he is not as sick as he first claimed: that he is feigning illness to avoid having to participate in the laborious work required of every healthy seaman. Many others had already grown suspicious of him, and Captain Allistoun reveals Wait&#x27;s charade before the entire crew. Wait claims he feels well enough now to work, but the captain orders that he be confined to the forecastle for the remainder of the voyage, a decision which quickly polarizes much of the crew between Wait&#x27;s supporters and detractors. Allistoun prevents a near-mutiny encouraged by the conniving Donkin. Forced to stay abed, Wait grows increasingly frail as his condition deteriorates. The ship continues to drift without a breeze and some of the crew, including Singleton, begin to whisper that Wait himself is responsible and that only his death will bring favourable winds.

As the ship passes the Azores and Wait nears death, Donkin discreetly plunders Wait&#x27;s personal belongings from his sea chest. Wait eventually succumbs and dies—the first proof that he was genuinely ill. This occurs within sight of land, as Singleton had predicted, and a strong wind returns immediately after Wait&#x27;s body is committed to the sea. The &quot;Narcissus&quot; soon arrives in England.

==History==

The work, written in 1896 and partly based on Conrad&#x27;s experiences of a voyage from Bombay to Dunkirk, began as a short story but developed into a novella of some 53,000 words. As it grew, Conrad began to think of its being serialized. After Smith Elder had rejected it for the &quot;Cornhill Magazine&quot;, William Ernest Henley accepted it for the &quot;New Review&quot;, and Conrad wrote to his agent, Edward Garnett, &quot;Now I have conquered Henley, I ain&#x27;t &#x27;fraid o&#x27; the divvle himself!&quot; Some years later, in 1904, Conrad described this acceptance as &quot;the first event in my writing life which really counted&quot;.

In the United States, the novel was first published under the title &quot;The Children of the Sea: A Tale of the Forecastle.&quot; The original had proven controversial in England, with one reviewer calling it &quot;the ugliest conceivable title&quot;; American reviewers were mixed, with one praising the new title for &quot;superior refinement&quot; and another arguing it &quot;insulted the public by imputing prudery to the American reader.&quot;

==Analysis==
The novel has been seen as an allegory about isolation and solidarity, with the ship&#x27;s company serving as a microcosm of a social group. Conrad appears to suggest that humanitarian sympathies are, at their core, feelings of self-interest and that a heightened sensitivity to suffering can be detrimental to the management of human society.

In 2006, in his critical study of Conrad, John G. Peters said of the work:

<doc id="327003" wikidata="Q718621" url="?curid=327003" title="Chebyshev filter">
<text>Chebyshev filters are analog or digital filters that have a steeper roll-off than Butterworth filters, and have either passband ripple (type I) or stopband ripple (type II). Chebyshev filters have the property that they minimize the error between the idealized and the actual filter characteristic over the operating frequency range of the filter, but they achieve this with ripples in the frequency response. This type of filter is named after Pafnuty Chebyshev because its mathematical characteristics are derived from Chebyshev polynomials. Type I Chebyshev filters are usually referred to as &quot;Chebyshev filters&quot;, while type II filters are usually called &quot;inverse Chebyshev filters&quot;. Because of the passband ripple inherent in Chebyshev filters, filters with a smoother response in the passband but a more irregular response in the stopband are preferred for certain applications.

== Type I Chebyshev filters (Chebyshev filters) ==
Type I Chebyshev filters are the most common types of Chebyshev filters. The gain (or amplitude) response, formula_1, as a function of angular frequency formula_2 of the formula_3th-order low-pass filter is equal to the absolute value of the transfer function formula_4 evaluated at formula_5:

:formula_6

where formula_7 is the ripple factor, formula_8 is the cutoff frequency and formula_9 is a Chebyshev polynomial of the formula_3th order.

The passband exhibits equiripple behavior, with the ripple determined by the ripple factor formula_7. In the passband, the Chebyshev polynomial alternates between -1 and 1 so the filter gain alternate between maxima at formula_12 and minima at formula_13.

The ripple factor ε is thus related to the passband ripple δ in decibels by:

:formula_14

At the cutoff frequency formula_8 the gain again has the value formula_16 but continues to drop into the stopband as the frequency increases. This behavior is shown in the diagram on the right. The common practice of defining the cutoff frequency at −3 dB is usually not applied to Chebyshev filters; instead the cutoff is taken as the point at which the gain falls to the value of the ripple for the final time.

The 3 dB frequency formula_17 is related to formula_8 by:

:formula_19

The order of a Chebyshev filter is equal to the number of reactive components (for example, inductors) needed to realize the filter using analog electronics.

An even steeper roll-off can be obtained if ripple is allowed in the stopband, by allowing zeros on the formula_2-axis in the complex plane. While this produces near-infinite suppression at and near these zeros (limited by the quality factor of the components, parasitics, and related factors), overall suppression in the stopband is reduced. The result is called an elliptic filter, also known as a Cauer filter.
=== Poles and zeroes ===
For simplicity, it is assumed that the cutoff frequency is equal to unity. The poles formula_21 of the gain function of the Chebyshev filter are the zeroes of the denominator of the gain function. Using the complex frequency formula_22, these occur when:

:formula_23

Defining formula_24 and using the trigonometric definition of the Chebyshev polynomials yields:

:formula_25

Solving for formula_26

:formula_27

where the multiple values of the arc cosine function are made explicit using the integer index formula_28. The poles of the Chebyshev gain function are then:

:formula_29
::::formula_30

Using the properties of the trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, this may be written in explicitly complex form:

:formula_31
::::formula_32

where formula_33 and

:formula_34

This may be viewed as an equation parametric in formula_35 and it demonstrates that the poles lie on an ellipse in formula_22-space centered at formula_37 with a real semi-axis of length formula_38 and an imaginary semi-axis of length of formula_39

=== The transfer function ===
The above expression yields the poles of the gain formula_40. For each complex pole, there is another which is the complex conjugate, and for each conjugate pair there are two more that are the negatives of the pair. The transfer function must be stable, so that its poles are those of the gain that have negative real parts and therefore lie in the left half plane of complex frequency space. The transfer function is then given by

:formula_41

where formula_42 are only those poles of the gain with a negative sign in front of the real term, obtained from the above equation.

=== The group delay ===
The group delay is defined as the derivative of the phase with respect to angular frequency:

:formula_43

The gain and the group delay for a 5th-order type I Chebyshev filter with ε=0.5 are plotted in the graph on the left. Its stop band has no ripples. But the ripples of group delay in its passband indicate that different frequency components have different delay, which along with the ripples of gain in its passband results in distortion of the waveform&#x27;s shape.
=== Even order modifications ===
Even order Chebyshev filters implemented with passive elements, typically inductors, capacitors, and transmission lines, with terminations of equal value on each side cannot be implemented with the traditional Chebyshev transfer function without the use of coupled coils, which may not be desirable or feasible, particularly at the higher frequencies. This is due to the physical inability to accommodate the even order Chebyshev reflection zeros that result in a scattering matrix S12 values that exceed the S12 value at formula_44. If it is not feasible to design the filter with one of the terminations increased or decreased to accommodate the pass band S12, then the Chebyshev transfer function must be modified so as to move the lowest even order reflection zero to formula_44 while maintaining the equi-ripple response of the pass band.

The needed modification involves mapping each pole of the Chebyshev transfer function in a manner that maps the lowest frequency reflection zero to zero and the remaining poles as needed to maintain the equi-ripple pass band. The lowest frequency reflection zero may be found from the Chebyshev Nodes, formula_46. The complete Chebyshev pole mapping function is shown below.
formula_47

Where:

n is the order of the filter (must be even)

P is a traditional Chebyshev transfer function pole

P&#x27; is the mapped pole for the modified even order transfer function.

&quot;Left Half Plane&quot; indicates to use the square root containing a negative real value.

When complete, a replacement equi-ripple transfer function is created with reflection zero scattering matrix values for S12 of one and S11 of zero when implemented with equally terminated passive networks. The illustration below shows an 8th order Chebyshev filter modified to support even order equally terminated passive networks by relocating the lowest frequency reflection zero from a finite frequency to 0 while maintaining an equi-ripple pass band frequency response.

The LC element value formulas in the Cauer topology are not applicable to the even order modified Chebyshev transfer function, and cannot be used. It is therefore necessary to calculate the LC values from traditional continued fractions of the impedance function, which may be derived from the reflection coefficient, which in turn may be derived from the transfer function.

=== Minimum order ===
To design a Chebyshev filter using the minimum required number of elements, the minimum order of the Chebyshev filter may be calculated as follows. The equations account for standard low pass Chebyshev filters, only. Even order modifications and finite stop band transmission zeros will introduce error that the equations do not account for.

formula_48

where:

formula_49 and formula_50 are the pass band ripple frequency and maximum ripple attenuation in dB

formula_51 and formula_52 are the stop band frequency and attenuation at that frequency in dB

formula_3 is the minimum number of poles, the order of the filter.

&quot;ceil&quot;[] is a round up to next integer function.

=== Setting the cutoff attenuation ===
Pass band cutoff attenuation for Chebyshev filters is usually the same as the pass band ripple attenuation, set by the computation above. However, many applications such as diplexers and triplexers, require a cutoff attenuation of -3.0103 dB in order to obtain the needed reflections. Other specialized applications may require other specific values for cutoff attenuation for various reasons. It is therefore useful to have a means available of setting the Chebyshev pass band cutoff attenuation independently of the pass band ripple attenuation, such as -1 dB, -10 dB, etc. The cutoff attenuation may be set by frequency scaling the poles of the transfer function.

The scaling factor may be determined by direct algebraic manipulation of the defining Chebyshev filter function, formula_1, including formula_7 and formula_56. The general definition of the Chebyshev function, formula_57 is required, which may be derived from the Chebyshev Polynomials equations, and the inverse Chebyshev function, formula_58. To keep the numbers real for values of formula_59, complex hyperbolic identities may be used to rewrite the equations as, formula_60 and formula_61.

Using simple algebra on the above equations and references, the expression to scale each Chebyshev poles is:

formula_62

Where:

formula_63 is the relocated pole positioned to set the desired cutoff attenuation.

formula_64 is a ripple cutoff pole that has been modified for even order pass bands.

formula_65 is the passband attenuation ripple in dB (.05 dB, 1 dB, etc.)).

formula_66 is the desired passband attenuation at the cutoff frequency in dB (1 dB, 3 dB, 10 dB, etc.)

formula_3 is the number of poles (the order of the filter).

formula_68 is the smallest even order Chebyshev Node

== Type II Chebyshev filters (inverse Chebyshev filters) ==
Also known as inverse Chebyshev filters, the Type II Chebyshev filter type is less common because it does not roll off as fast as Type I, and requires more components. It has no ripple in the passband, but does have equiripple in the stopband. The gain is:

:formula_69

In the stopband, the Chebyshev polynomial oscillates between -1 and 1 so that the gain will oscillate between zero and

:formula_70

and the smallest frequency at which this maximum is attained is the cutoff frequency formula_71. The parameter ε is thus related to the stopband attenuation γ in decibels by:

:formula_72

For a stopband attenuation of 5 dB, ε = 0.6801; for an attenuation of 10 dB, ε = 0.3333. The frequency &quot;f&quot;0 = &quot;ω&quot;0/2&quot;π&quot; is the cutoff frequency. The 3 dB frequency &quot;f&quot;H is related to &quot;f&quot;0 by:

:formula_73

=== Poles and zeroes ===
Assuming that the cutoff frequency is equal to unity, the poles formula_21 of the gain of the Chebyshev filter are the zeroes of the denominator of the gain:

:formula_75

The poles of gain of the type II Chebyshev filter are the inverse of the poles of the type I filter:

:formula_76
:formula_77

where formula_78. The zeroes formula_79 of the type II Chebyshev filter are the zeroes of the numerator of the gain:

:formula_80

The zeroes of the type II Chebyshev filter are therefore the inverse of the zeroes of the Chebyshev polynomial.

:formula_81

for formula_78.

=== The transfer function ===
The transfer function is given by the poles in the left half plane of the gain function, and has the same zeroes but these zeroes are single rather than double zeroes.

=== The group delay ===
The gain and the group delay for a fifth-order type II Chebyshev filter with ε=0.1 are plotted in the graph on the left. It can be seen that there are ripples in the gain in the stopband but not in the pass band.
=== Even order modifications ===
Just like Chebyshev filter even order filters, the standard Chebyshev II even order filter cannot be implemented with equally terminated passive elements without the use of coupled coils, which may not be desirable or feasible. In the Chebyshev Ii case, this is due to finite attenuation of S12 in the stop band. However, even order Chebyshev II filters may be modified by translating the highest frequency finite transmission zero to infinity, while maintaining the equi-ripple functions of the Chebyshev II stop band. To do this translation, an even order modified Chebyshev function is used in place of the standard Chebyshev function to define the Chebyshev II poles needed to create the even order modified Chebyshev II transfer function. Zeros are created using the roots of the even order modified Chebyshev polynomial, which are the even order modified Chebyshev nodes.

The illustration below shows an 8th order Inverse Chebyshev filter modified to support even order equally terminated passive networks by relocating the highest frequency transmission zero from a finite frequency to formula_83 while maintaining an equi-ripple stop band frequency response.

=== Minimum order ===
To design an Inverse Chebyshev filter using the minimum required number of elements, the minimum order of the Inverse Chebyshev filter may be calculated as follows. The equations account for standard low pass Inverse Chebyshev filters, only. Even order modifications will introduce error that the equations do not account for. The equations is identical to that used for Chebyshev filter minimum order, with a slightly different variable definitions.

formula_48

where:

formula_49 and formula_50 are the pass band frequency and attenuation at that frequency in dB

formula_51 and formula_52 are the stop band frequency and minimum stop band attenuation in dB

formula_3 is the minimum number of poles, the order of the filter.

&quot;ceil&quot;[] is a round up to next integer function.

=== Setting the cutoff attenuation ===
The standard cutoff attenuation as described is the same at the pass band ripple attenuation. However, just as in Chebyshev filters, it is useful to set the cutoff attenuation to a desired value, and for the same reasons. Setting the Chebyshev II cutoff attenuation is the same as for Chebyshev cutoff attenuation, except the arithmetic attenuation and ripple entries are inverted in the equation and the poles and zeros are multiplied by the result, as opposed to divided by in the Chebyshev case..

formula_90

== Implementation ==

=== Cauer topology ===
A passive LC Chebyshev low-pass filter may be realized using a Cauer topology. The inductor or capacitor values of an formula_3th-order Chebyshev prototype filter may be calculated from the following equations:

:formula_92

:formula_93

:formula_94

:formula_95

G1, Gk are the capacitor or inductor element values.
fH, the 3 dB frequency is calculated with: formula_96

The coefficients &quot;A&quot;, &quot;γ&quot;, &quot;β&quot;, &quot;A&quot;&quot;k&quot;, and &quot;B&quot;&quot;k&quot; may be calculated from the following equations:

:formula_97

:formula_98

:formula_99

:formula_100
where formula_101 is the passband ripple in decibels.
The number formula_102 is rounded from the exact value formula_103.

The calculated &quot;G&quot;&quot;k&quot; values may then be converted into shunt capacitors and series inductors as shown on the right, or they may be converted into series capacitors and shunt inductors. For example,

*&quot;C&quot;1 shunt = G1, &quot;L&quot;2 series = &quot;G&quot;2, ...
or 
*&quot;L&quot;1 shunt = &quot;G&quot;1, &quot;C&quot;1 series = &quot;G&quot;2, ...

Note that when G1 is a shunt capacitor or series inductor, G0 corresponds to the input resistance or conductance, respectively. The same relationship holds for Gn+1 and Gn. The resulting circuit is a normalized low-pass filter. Using frequency transformations and impedance scaling, the normalized low-pass filter may be transformed into high-pass, band-pass, and band-stop filters of any desired cutoff frequency or bandwidth.

=== Digital ===
As with most analog filters, the Chebyshev may be converted to a digital (discrete-time) recursive form via the bilinear transform. However, as digital filters have a finite bandwidth, the response shape of the transformed Chebyshev is warped. Alternatively, the Matched Z-transform method may be used, which does not warp the response.

==Comparison with other linear filters==
The following illustration shows the Chebyshev filters next to other common filter types obtained with the same number of coefficients (fifth order):

Chebyshev filters are sharper than the Butterworth filter; they are not as sharp as the elliptic one, but they show fewer ripples over the bandwidth.

== Advanced Topics in Chebyshev Filters ==
Chebyshev filter design flexibility may be augmented by more advanced design methods documented in this section. Transmission zeros may be inserted into the stop band to neutralize specific undesired frequencies or increase the cut-off attenuation, or may be inserted off-axis to obtain a more desirable group delay. Asymmetric Chebyshev band pass filters may be created that contain differing number of poles on each side of the pass band to meet frequency asymmetric design requirements more efficiently. The equi-ripple pass bands and that Chebyshev filters are known for may be restricted to a percentage of the pass band to meet design requirements more efficiently that only call for a portion of the pass band to be equi-ripple.

=== Chebyshev transmission zeros ===
Chebyshev filters may be designed with arbitrarily placed finite transmission zeros in the stop band while retaining an equi-ripple pass band. Stop band zeros along the formula_104 axis are generally used to eliminate unwanted frequencies. Stop band zeros along the real axis or quadruplet stop band zeros in the complex plane may be used to modify the group delay to a more desirable shape. The transmission zeros design utilizes characteristic polynomials, K(S), to place the transmission and reflection zeros, which in turn are used to create the transfer function, formula_105,

formula_106

The calculation of K(S) relies upon the following observed equality.

formula_107

for all formula_108, imaginary conjugate pairs, quadruplet conjugate pairs, or real opposing signed pairs. 

Given the magnitude is always one in the pass bane (formula_109) the rational and irrational terms must vary between 0 and 1. Therefore, if only the rational term is used to create the formula_110 characteristic function, an equi-ripple response is expected in the pass band, and characteristic poles (transmission zeros) are expected at all formula_111.

The design process for K(S) using the above expression is below.

formula_112

Use the positive formula_113 solution for real and imaginary formula_114 pairs. Use the positive real and conjugate imaginary formula_113solution for quadruplet complex formula_114 pairs.

formula_110 should be normalized such that formula_118, if needed.

The, &quot;rational terms only&quot; indicates to keep the rational part of the product, and to discard the irrational part. The rational term may be obtained by manually performing the polynomial arithmetic, or with the short cut below which is a solution derived from polynomial arithmetic and uses binomial coefficients. The algorithm is extremely efficient if the Binomial coefficients are implemented from a look-up table of pre-calculated values. 

formula_119

When all M values are set to one, then formula_120 will be the standard Chebyshev equation, which is expected since the all transmission zeros are it formula_83. Even order finite transmission zero Chebyshev filters have the same limitation as the all-pole case in that they cannot be constructed using equally terminated passive networks. The same even order modification may be made to the even order characteristic polynomials, formula_110, to make equally terminated passive network implementations possible. However, the even order modification will also move the finite transmission zeros slightly. This movement may be significantly mitigated by propositioning the transmission zeros with the inverse of the even order modification using the lowest Chebyshev node, formula_123.

formula_124

==== Simple transmission zeros example ====
Design a 3 pole Chebyshev filter with a 1 dB pass band, a transmission zero at 2 rad/sec, and a transmission zero at formula_83:

formula_126
To find the formula_105 transfer function, do the following.

formula_128

To obtain formula_105 from the left half plane, factor the numerator and denominator to obtain the roots. Discard all roots from the right half plane of the denominator, half the repeated roots in the numerator, and rebuild formula_105 with the remaining roots. Generally, normalize formula_131 to 1 at formula_37.

formula_133

To confirm that the example formula_105 is correct, the plot of formula_105 along formula_104 is shown below with a pass band ripple of 1 dB, a cut off frequency of 1 rad/sec, and a stop band zero at 2 rad/sec.
=== Asymmetric band pass filter ===
Chebyshev band pass filters may be designed with a geometrically asymmetric frequency response by placing the desired number of transmission zeros at zero and infinity with the use of the more generalized form of the Chebyshev transmission zeros equation above, and shown below. The formula_110 equations below consider a frequency normalized pass band from 1 to formula_138. If the number of transmission zeros at 0 is not the same as the number of transmission zeros at formula_83, the filter will be geometrically asymmetric. The filter will also be asymmetric if finite transmission zeros are not place symmetrically about the geometric center frequency, which in this case is formula_140. There is a restriction in that he filter must be net even order, that is the sum of all the poles must be even, to make the asymmetric formula_110 equation produce usable results. Real and complex quadruplet transmission zeros may also be created using this technique and are useful to modify the group delay response, just as in the low pass case. The derivation of the characteristic equation, formula_110, to create an asymmetric Chebyshev band pass filter is shown below.

formula_143

formula_110 should be normalized such that formula_118, if needed.

==== Simple asymmetric example ====
Design an asymmetric Chebyshev filter with 1dB pass band ripple from 1 to 2 rad/sec, one transmission zero at formula_83, and three transmission zeros at 0. By applying the numeral values to the equations above, the characteristic polynomials, formula_110, may be calculated as follows.

formula_148

Discarding the irrational part and normalizing formula_149 to 1 at s=j:

formula_150

Use the same process as in the low pass case to find formula_105 from formula_110, using constant formula_153 to scale the magnitude.

formula_154

When reconstructing the denominator from the left half plane poles, it will be necessary to set the formula_105 magnitude such that the reflection zeros occur at 0dB. To do this, formula_105 should be scaled such that formula_131 = -1dB at the pass band corner frequencies, formula_158 and formula_159. Once accomplished, the final transfer function for the designed asymmetric Chebyshev filter is shown below.

formula_160

Evaluating formula_131 at s=j and at s=2j produces a value of -1dB in both cases, yielding an assurance that the example has been synthesized correctly. The frequency response is below, showing a Chebyshev 1dB equi-ripple pass band response for formula_162, cutoff attenuation of -1dB at the pass band edges, -60dB / decade attenuation toward formula_44, -20dB / decade attenuation toward formula_164, and Chebyshev style steepened slopes near the pass band edges.
=== Constricting the pass band ripple ===
Standard low pass Chebyshev filter design creates an equi-ripple pass band beginning from 0 rad/sec to a frequency normalized value of 1 rad/sec. However, some design requirements do not need an equi-ripple pass band at the low frequencies. A standard full-equi-ripple Chebyshev filter for this application would result in an over designed filter. Constricting the equi-ripple to a defined percentage of the pass band creates a more efficient design, reducing the size of the filter and potentially eliminating one or two components, which is useful in maximizing board space efficiency and minimizing production costs for mass produced items.

Constricted pass band ripple can be achieved by designing an asymmetric Chebyshev band pass filter using the techniques described above in this article with a 0 order asymmetric high pass side (no transmission zeros at 0) and an formula_165 set to the constricted ripple frequency. The order of the low pass side is N-1 for odd order filters, N-2 for even order modified filters, and N for standard even order filters. This results in a less than unity S12 at formula_44, which is typical of even order standard Chebyshev design, so for standard even order Chebyshev designs, the process is complete at this step. It will be necessary to insert a single reflection zero at formula_44 for odd order designs, and two reflection zeros at formula_44 for even order modified designs. Added reflection zeros introduces a noticeable error in the pass band that is likely to be objectionable. This error may be removed quickly and accurately by repositioning the finite reflection zeros with the use of Newton&#x27;s method for systems of equations.

==== Application of Newton&#x27;s method ====
Positioning the reflection zeros with Newton&#x27;s method requires three pieces of information:

# The location of each pass band ripple minima that exists at frequencies higher than the constricted ripple frequency.
# The value of the magnitude normalized formula_169, that is formula_170, at the constriction frequency and at each minima above the constriction frequency. Future references to this function will be noted as &lt;math&gt;|K(j\omega)_

<text>Peace Orchestra is a musical solo project from the Austrian music producer Peter Kruder, best known as one half of Kruder &amp; Dorfmeister.

== History ==
In parallel to his partnership with Dorfmeister, Peter Kruder has always followed his solo projects. After the Kruder and Dorfmeister releases &quot;DJ Kicks&quot; (!K7, 1996) and &quot;K&amp;D Sessions&quot; (!K7, 1998) became global bestsellers, he followed up with his solo project &quot;Peace Orchestra&quot;. &quot;Peace Orchestra&quot; is also the title of an album recorded by Kruder and released to critical acclaim in 1999. The album&#x27;s most well-known track is &quot;Who Am I&quot;, which received a great deal of exposure through its use in The Wachowskis&#x27; Animatrix project alongside tracks by Photek, Death in Vegas and Juno Reactor. It was also used in the movies &quot;Stay&quot; (2005), and Memento (Christopher Nolan, 2000).

An album of Peace Orchestra remixes by such artists as Gotan Project, Chateau Flight, Beanfield, DJ DSL and Trüby Trio was released in 2002, entitled &quot;Reset&quot;.
In addition to releasing under the &quot;Peace Orchestra&quot; moniker Peter Kruder&#x27;s solo remixes were in demand by artists like Bebel Gilberto, Fauna Flash and various other artists. With Fauna Flash - Munich DJs and producers Christian Prommer and Roland Appel - Kruder kicked off the project in 2001.

<text>Nigel Allan Havers (born 6 November 1951) is an English actor and presenter. His film roles include Lord Andrew Lindsay in the 1981 British film &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;, which earned him a BAFTA nomination; as Dr. Rawlins in the 1987 Steven Spielberg war drama &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot;; and as Ronny in the 1984 David Lean epic &quot;A Passage to India&quot;. Television roles include Tom Latimer in the British TV comedy series &quot;Don&#x27;t Wait Up&quot; and Lewis Archer in &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, between 2009 and 2019.

==Early life and family==
Havers was born in Edmonton, Middlesex, and is the younger of two sons of Sir Michael Havers (later Lord Havers), a barrister who became a controversial Attorney General for England and Wales and, briefly, Lord Chancellor in the Conservative Government in the 1980s. His father was lead prosecution counsel in two significant miscarriages of justice, of the Guildford Four and of the Maguire family and Giuseppe Conlon, the latter who died in prison an innocent man. The DPP was found to have suppressed alibi evidence that showed two were innocent before the trial started, and similarly suppressed confessions subsequently from the Balcome Street Gang that exonerated the wrongfully convicted. Michael Havers was never held accountable for his role in these miscarriages of justice. 

His paternal aunt, Lady Butler-Sloss, his grandfather Sir Cecil Havers and elder brother Philip Havers KC also had prominent legal careers. His paternal uncle, David Havers, was a Manchester-based businessman.

Havers took part in the BBC TV series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, broadcast in the UK in July 2013. As part of the show he explored his ancestry from an Essex businessman, on his father&#x27;s side, and a Cornish miller on his mother&#x27;s side.

==Education==
Havers was educated at Nowton Court Prep School in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk and the Arts Educational School, an independent school in London, opting against the Eton education traditional to his family (except his father, who was educated at Westminster School), because he thought that fagging &quot;sounded frightful&quot;.

==Professional life and career==
Havers is most known for &quot;playing the quintessential, old school Englishman with his dashing good looks, cut-glass accent and thoroughly charming manner&quot;. Havers&#x27;s first acting job was in the radio series &quot;Mrs Dale&#x27;s Diary&quot; and he subsequently went on to working for the Prospect Theatre Company initially &quot;carrying a spear and making cups of tea&quot; as he puts it in his autobiography.

In the 70s he was a researcher for nine years on the Jimmy Young radio show, particularly responsible for enticing politicians thanks to his father&#x27;s contacts, including helping obtain Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s first radio interview.

From an early age Havers had an eye for the ladies; Kenneth More, a friend of his father, advised a young Havers that &quot;If you are charming, you don&#x27;t have to ask them to go to bed, they ask you&quot;. He describes his experiences with an early leading lady, Maxine Audley thus: &quot;I was in her dressing room doing whatever she asked me to, and I mean anything and everything. One afternoon I sauntered into her dressing room, still in my officer&#x27;s kit, only to find a similarly clad new member of the cast rehearsing what I had perfected over the past few months. My time was up. She blew me a kiss and I slid away. Actually, I was rather relieved, I needed a rest.&quot;

After his theatre work, Havers slid into a period of acting unemployment, during which time he worked for a wine merchant. He ended this part of his career when his girlfriend, who later became his first wife, Carolyn Cox, suggested they move in together in 1974.

In 1975, Havers&#x27;s career began to pick up with an appearance in &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs,&quot; appearing in one of the series&#x27; last episodes, &quot;Joke Over&quot; as Peter Dinmont, one of Georgina&#x27;s (Lesley-Anne Down) &quot;Roaring Twenties&quot; &quot;party&quot; friends. Dinmont is in the Rolls-Royce when Georgina accidentally kills a farmer on a bicycle. Dinmont refuses to testify on Georgina&#x27;s behalf at a preliminary trial, as he was passed out drunk in the back seat and did not witness the accident.

It was also in 1975 that Havers appeared in the Granada Television daytime series &quot;Crown Court,&quot; in which he played a hapless heroin addict, Patrick Mills, who stands trial on a series of drug offences.

His first film appearance was a small part in &quot;Pope Joan&quot; (1972) and he was a character in &quot;The Glittering Prizes&quot; (1976), but his first major success came with the leading role in a BBC dramatisation of &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; (1977), closely followed by another BBC drama serial, &quot;A Horseman Riding By&quot; (1978). By the time he appeared in the film &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; (1981), he had become a familiar face on British television. Despite his work in such films as &quot;A Passage to India&quot; (1984), &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot; (1987) and &quot;Farewell to the King&quot; (1989), he never became a film star, but has continued in a succession of starring roles on television. He co-starred for several years in the 1980s BBC sitcom &quot;Don&#x27;t Wait Up&quot; (1983–1990) alongside Dinah Sheridan and Tony Britton. He also starred in &quot;The Little Princess&quot; (1986) with Maureen Lipman, which won him a dedicated audience. He is also widely recognised in the Lloyds Bank television commercials.

Havers co-starred with Warren Clarke in the 1991 comedic mini-series &quot;Sleepers&quot; on the BBC. In it, he and Clarke played former KGB spies who had assimilated into English life in the 1960s and were &quot;lost&quot; for 25 years. Successfully and happily living as Englishmen, their worlds are turned upside-down when they discover that the KGB is looking for them. As they resist going back to Russia, the ex-spies lead the KGB, CIA, and MI5 on a madcap chase through England.

Havers appeared on &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1992, having been surprised by host Michael Aspel at Twickenham Film Studios. He later wrote an autobiography, titled &quot;Playing with Fire&quot;, which was published in October 2006 by Headline Publishing Group.

In 2009, Havers appeared in the U.S. television drama &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot;, and the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-off &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;. On 18 December 2009, he first appeared in the British soap (broadcast on the ITV network) &quot;Coronation Street&quot; playing the charming escort Lewis Archer, who woos Audrey Roberts. He left on 13 August 2010. He returned to the role on 17 February 2012 and left again on 1 February 2013. He returned again on 1 June 2018 and remained in &quot;Coronation Street&quot; until the character&#x27;s death on 1 January 2019.

In November 2010, Havers became a contestant on the tenth series of &quot;I&#x27;m A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, which started on 14 November 2010. On 21 November, Havers left the show after vehemently objecting to a challenge called Kangaroo Court in which contestants who lost the challenge would be subjected to an electric shock.

As a guest star in the 2011 Christmas Special episode of television show &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;, Havers portrayed Lord Hepworth, a charming and hopeful suitor of wealthy Lady Rosamund Painswick, the widowed sister of the Earl of Grantham played by Samantha Bond. In the episode, Hepworth is discovered having an affair with Lady Rosamund&#x27;s maid and outed as a &quot;fortune hunter.&quot; Series creator Julian Fellowes remarked in his book of teleplays for the second series of &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; that &quot;no one in Equity is better&quot; than Havers &quot;at playing a cad.&quot;

In July 2012, Havers presented a programme on ITV called &quot;The Real Chariots of Fire&quot;, a documentary about the runners who inspired the film &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;. In 2014, he played Tony Pebble in &quot;The Life of Rock with Brian Pern&quot;, a BBC Four comedy which parodied the life and career of former Genesis singer, Peter Gabriel. On 25 January 2015, Havers took part in celebrity talent show &quot;Get Your Act Together&quot;.

Havers appeared in the ninth series of the sitcom &quot;Benidorm,&quot; in 2017, returning as the same character for the tenth series in 2018. He also joined fellow celebrities Simon Callow, Lorraine Chase, and Debbie McGee on the Channel 5 (UK) show, &quot;Celebrity Carry On Barging&quot;, later that year.

December 2024, he is the narrator of the new Channel 4 series Help! We Bought a Hotel (UK) 

==Personal life==

In the mid-1980s, Havers began an affair with Polly Williams, the daughter of actor Hugh Williams and the sister of his friend, the actor Simon Williams. He has stated that he had several affairs during his first marriage, which he now regrets. Havers has written of the depression he experienced trying to choose between his marriage to Carolyn Cox and their young daughter Kate, born in 1977, and his mistress. During this time, he consulted a psychiatrist at the Devonshire Hospital in London. Things were resolved in his mind when he took on a role in the TV film, &quot;Naked Under Capricorn&quot;, which was filmed in Alice Springs, Australia. He describes in his autobiography wrangling a herd of cattle and catching sight in the distance of a figure who turned out to be Williams. The couple got married in 1989, and the marriage lasted until her death on 24 June 2004. A blessing was held in Saint Tropez the following month. Following his wife&#x27;s death, Havers took legal action, claiming her will left him without &quot;reasonable financial provision&quot;. The case was settled before court; Havers was awarded £375,000 and proceeds from the sale of some of his late wife&#x27;s belongings.

Havers was arrested in February 1990 on suspicion of drunk driving, and taken to Harrow police station. He was later banned from driving for one year, and fined £500, but told a woman&#x27;s magazine &quot;I don&#x27;t regret it at all&quot;. He continued, &quot;I thought the whole thing was pretty unfair. I was only 300 yards from home in a restaurant and had only used my car anyway because it was pouring with rain.&quot; He said &quot;I got the same punishment as people who are three times over the limit. I felt victimised, especially as the police know who I am.&quot; He was criticised for these comments by John Knight, co-founder of the Campaign against Drinking and Driving, while a spokesman for the Association of Chief Police Officers said &quot;I think he&#x27;s probably a little bit out of touch with public feeling.&quot;

On 8 June 2007, Havers married Essex native Georgiana &quot;George&quot; Bronfman (née Rita Webb), in New York City. Bronfman is the former spouse of Canadian-American businessman Edgar Bronfman.

He is the godfather of comedian Jack Whitehall.

<text>The woodlark or wood lark (Lullula arborea) is the only extant species in the lark genus &quot;Lullula&quot;. It is found across most of Europe, the Middle East, western Asia and the mountains of north Africa. It is mainly resident (non-migratory) in the west of its range, but eastern populations of this passerine bird are more migratory, moving further south in winter.

There are two subspecies of woodlark, &quot;L. a. arborea&quot; and &quot;L. a. pallida&quot;. The former is native to northern regions of Europe, while the latter can be found in the south of the woodlark&#x27;s range. Their diet is mostly composed of seeds but also includes insects during the breeding period. A comparatively small bird, the woodlark is between 13.5 and 15 centimetres long and roughly 20% shorter than the skylark. It is a brown bird with a pale underside and has a white-tipped tail.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The woodlark was described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; and given the binomial name &quot;Alauda arborea&quot;. This binomial name is identical to the Latin name used in 1676 by English ornithologist Francis Willughby in his &quot;Ornithologiae libri tres&quot;. The woodlark is now placed in the genus &quot;Lullula&quot; that was introduced by the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup in 1829. The current genus name is onomatopoeic from French “Lulu”, the name given to the bird by de Buffon. The French name, &quot;Alouette lulu&quot;, and the scientific name, &quot;Lullula arborea&quot;, are derived from the sound of its song. The specific &quot;arborea&quot; is from Latin &quot;arbor, arboris&quot;, &quot;tree&quot;.

=== Subspecies ===
There are two subspecies of woodlark: 
* Northern woodlark (&quot;L. a. arborea&quot;) - : Found from northern, western and central Europe to western Russia and Ukraine
* Southern woodlark (&quot;L. a. pallida&quot;) - : Found from southern Europe and north-western Africa through the Middle East to Iran and Turkmenistan, Crimea and Caucasus.

==Description==

This is a 13.5- to 15-cm-long bird, slightly smaller than the skylark being roughly 20% shorter. The woodlark is mainly brown above and pale below, but with a distinctive white superciliar meeting on the nape. It has a crest which is quite small and at most times inconspicuous. In flight it shows a short tail and short broad wings. The tail is tipped with white, but unlike the skylark, the tail sides and the rear edge of the wings are not edged with white.

A songbird, the woodlark has a melodious, warbling song often described onomatopoeically as a &quot;lu-lu-lu-&quot; or, more precisely, as a &quot;serial &quot;lū-lū-lū-lū-lū-&quot;&quot;, &quot;toolooeet toolooeet toolooeet&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
Found mainly in Europe, the mountains of northern Africa and western Asia, the woodlark is present across much of its range. In Europe, the bird seems most at home in the sandy heaths of Belgium, where its density was 7.5 pairs per square kilometre (km2) in 1988. In the same year, densities in East Germany ranged from 0.29 to 5.0 pairs per km2 and between 0.1 and 0.25 pairs per km2 in southern England, with more optimal habitats being more densely populated. However, populations fluctuated across Europe in the 1990s and 2000s and more up-to-date density figures are unavailable. The extent of the woodlark&#x27;s range is England in the west, parts of northern Egypt to the south, Iran and Turkmenistan to the east and the Scandinavian Peninsula in the north. Declining populations have resulted in the woodlark&#x27;s range contracting, for example in Britain it once bred in Wales and central England but is now found only in southern England. Within its range it is mainly resident in the west, with eastern populations migrating south in the winter.

The woodlark&#x27;s natural habitat is heathland and open spaces sparsely populated with trees. They prefer clearings in pine forests and heathland and like newly planted areas with pine saplings. Experimental work showed that annual ground‐disturbance can increase Woodlark abundance within lowland grass‐heaths. The bird can also be found more rarely in urban areas. For example, in 1950 a pair were recorded on a main road near Putney Heath, London.

==Behaviour and ecology==

The male woodlark has a song flight similar to that of the Eurasian skylark but flutters more as he rises and spirals upwards, circling the ground as he sings at a fairly constant height. Both male and female birds will also sing from the ground or a perch. Birds start singing early in the season, usually around February in Britain.

===Breeding===

The nest is generally made from grass, bracken, roots and moss and constructed in a depression on the ground. Nesting starts early, sometimes with the first eggs laid before end of March. Usually between three and five eggs are laid. The female will incubate the eggs, which are whitish with brown speckles, for 13 to 15 days. Both parents will then feed the young in the nest and the chicks leave the nest after a further 11 to 13 days. Families stay together for the summer and into the autumn. Two, sometimes three broods will be raised each year.

===Food and feeding===
As with many of the birds in the lark family, the woodlark is primarily vegetarian as an adult but during the breeding season will also eat medium-sized insects. The diet is mainly composed of seeds and such insects as beetles, flies and moths. During the breeding season, the female incubates the eggs in spells of approximately 45 minutes and intervals of eight minutes feeding.

===Threats===
Populations of woodlark across Europe have been in decline and ranges have been contracting in recent years. Habitat loss is thought to be a major contributor to this, with dry grassland, fallow land, lowland heathland and pasture being lost to agriculture, abandonment and development across Northern Europe. Recent wildfires in England are also thought to have damaged the population, with some protected woodlark habitats having been destroyed.

==In culture==

The woodlark is commemorated in the works of two major poets. &quot;The Woodlark&quot;, written by Gerard Manley Hopkins, departs from the standard tradition of British nature poetry by trying to transliterate the bird&#x27;s song into made-up words.

The Scottish poet Robert Burns wrote of the bird&#x27;s &quot;melting art&quot; in his poem &quot;To the Woodlark&quot;. As there are currently no woodlarks in Scotland, and Burns never travelled south of Carlisle, many have speculated that Burns never came in contact with the bird and was in fact writing about the tree pipit, which was commonly referred to as the woodlark in Scotland. The woodlark&#x27;s song is also thought to be melodious while Burns&#x27; poem has an &quot;underlying sense of grief&quot; which may be attributed to the languishing notes at the end of the tree pipit&#x27;s song. However, the woodlark has been spotted in Scotland on occasion and it is possible that Burns was writing about this bird. This is backed up by the entry of a minister from Clinic, Perthshire in the &quot;Old Statistical Account&quot;, which reads &quot;The notes of the wood-lark are heard, delightful along the banks of the Lunan in spring and autumn; its nocturnal song has a dying cadence peculiarly melodious and has often been mistaken for the song of the Philomel [nightingale].&quot;

==Status==
In Europe in 2004, the breeding population of woodlarks was estimated to number 1.3 million to 3.3 million breeding pairs. Europe accounts for 75-94% of the global population, meaning between 4.15 million and 13.2 million individuals in its world range. Populations of woodlark have fluctuated across Europe, with specific figures available for Britain showing these fluctuations. An estimated 400 breeding pairs were present in England in 1981. A series of systematic national surveys found 241 pairs in 1986, which increased to 1633 pairs in 1997 followed by an 88% increase to 3064 pairs in 2007. The woodlark has been categorised by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as being of least concern, meaning that it is not currently threatened with extinction.

<text>RWM is the callsign of a high frequency (shortwave) standard frequency and time signal radio station in Moscow, Russia. It is controlled by All-Russian Scientific Research Institute for Physical-Engineering and Radiotechnical Metrology, and operated by Russian Television and Radio Broadcasting Network. Transmitting frequencies are 4.996 MHz with 5 kW and on 9.996 and 14.996 MHz with 8 kW.

The frequencies are very close to those of WWV and WWVH. Because of this, RWM is very difficult to receive in North America with simple receivers of low selectivity, due to interference from these said stations.

The mode of transmission is N0N and A1A (CW). Between 0 and 8 minutes past the hour, RWM transmits a straight unmodulated carrier wave. At 9 minutes past, RWM identifies itself in Morse code. Between 10 and 20 minutes past the hour, RWM transmits a pulse of carrier every second, with the difference between UT1 and UTC in units of one-fiftieth of a second encoded onto the once-per-second pulses. Between 20 and 30 minutes past the hour, RWM transmits 10 carrier pulses each second. This transmission cycle is repeated every half-hour.

RWM does not transmit the time of day, only standard time intervals.

The 1 Hz pulses begin on the second, and are doubled (a second pulse transmitted from 200–300 ms past the second) to encode DUT1 and dUT1. Using these values, UT1 may be computed as:

: UT1 = UTC + DUT1 × 0.1 s + dUT1 × 0.02 s

DUT1 may vary between −8 and +8. The number of double pulses sent during seconds 1–8 of each minute encode positive values; if DUT1 = +5, then pulses 1 through 5 will be doubled. Doubling pulses 9–16 encodes negative values similarly.

dUT1 varies from −4 to +4. Positive values are encoded by double pulses during seconds 21–24 of each minute. Negative values are encoded during seconds 31–34.

The 10 Hz pulses are widened in a pattern similar to that of the Beta time signal: Most pulses are 20 ms, but ones sent on the second are 40 ms, and ones sent on the minute are 500 ms.

<text>The South Saskatchewan River is a major river in the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. The river begins at the confluence of the Bow and Oldman Rivers in southern Alberta and ends at the Saskatchewan River Forks in central Saskatchewan. The Saskatchewan River Forks is the confluence of the South and North Saskatchewan Rivers and is the beginning of the Saskatchewan River.

For the first half of the 20th century, the South Saskatchewan would completely freeze over during winter, creating spectacular ice breaks and dangerous conditions in Saskatoon, Medicine Hat, and elsewhere. At least one bridge in Saskatoon was destroyed by ice carried by the river. The construction of the Gardiner Dam in the 1960s, however, lessened the power of the river by diverting a substantial portion of the South Saskatchewan&#x27;s natural flow into the Qu&#x27;Appelle River. By the 1980s many permanent sandbars had formed due to the lowering of the level of the river.

From the headwaters of the Bow River, the South Saskatchewan flows for . At its mouth at Saskatchewan River Forks, it has an average discharge of and has a watershed of , 1,800 of which are in Montana in the United States and in Alberta and Saskatchewan.

== Course ==

The river originates at the confluence of the Bow and Oldman Rivers, north of Grassy Lake, Alberta at the incorporated community of Bow Island, not to be confused with the town of Bow Island, Alberta. The waters of these two rivers, in turn, originate from winter snowpack and rainfall in the Rocky Mountains near the British Columbia and Montana border. Glacier and snowmelt from the Rocky Mountains and foothills contributes nearly 90% of the annual flow, with most of that contribution during July and August. The Red Deer River is a major tributary of the South Saskatchewan merging east of the Alberta-Saskatchewan border. The Lake Diefenbaker reservoir was created with the construction of the Gardiner and Qu&#x27;Appelle River dams in Saskatchewan. Water from the South Saskatchewan flowing through the dams provides approximately 19 percent of the hydro-electricity generated by SaskPower.

Downstream from the dam the river flows north through Saskatoon and joins the North Saskatchewan River east of Prince Albert at the Saskatchewan River Forks — thus forming the Saskatchewan River. For approximately near Saskatoon, the Meewasin Valley Authority is responsible for conservation of the river environment. Numerous lakes in the Saskatoon area were formed by oxbows of the South Saskatchewan River, most notably Moon Lake and Pike Lake.

A 2009 report, produced by WWF-Canada which analysed the river flow on ten major Canadian rivers reported that the South Saskatchewan River was the most at risk. Climate change, agricultural and urban infrastructure water use, and dams producing hydroelectricity, have all combined to reduce the flow of the South Saskatchewan River by 70 percent. Developers and governments have been cautioned to protect and restore the river with sustainable projects and limit water diversion. Dickson Dam regulates water supply downstream on the Red Deer River; the Bassano Dam and 11 other dams divert water on the Bow River and in the Bow River basin; and the Oldman River Dam and Waterton-St. Mary Headworks System manage water flow downstream of the Oldman River. The proposed Meridian dam west of Leader and north east of Medicine Hat was cancelled due to project costs outweighing the irrigation benefits.

== Tributaries ==

The following are the tributaries of the South Saskatchewan River from its source to its mouth:

* Bow River
* Oldman River
* Seven Persons Creek
** Ross Creek
* Mitchell Creek
* Red Deer River
* Alkali Creek
* Swift Current Creek (flows into Lake Diefenbaker)
* Brightwater Creek

== Geology ==
Sections of the riverbank along the South Saskatchewan River are prone to slumping. Since its founding, the city of Saskatoon has dealt with a number of slope failures. Controlling riverbank development was a factor in establishing the Meewasin Valley Authority in 1979.

== Important Bird Areas of Canada ==
There are four Important Bird Areas (IBA) of Canada along the South Saskatchewan River. Two – Galloway and Miry Bay (SK006) and East Lake Diefenbaker (SK055) – are located at Lake Diefenbaker and the other two are farther upstream along the river&#x27;s course.

Suffield (AB 007) () is in Alberta on the Canadian Forces Base Suffield. Covering an area of , the IBA consists of two sections on the base along the north-western shore of the South Saskatchewan River. The landscape consists of mixed grasslands with intermittent salt lakes and natural springs. Birds found at the site include the burrowing owl, loggerhead shrike, long-billed curlew, ferruginous hawk, McCown&#x27;s longspur, Brewer&#x27;s sparrow, upland sandpiper, Baird&#x27;s sparrow, Sprague&#x27;s pipit, grasshopper sparrow, western meadowlark, golden eagle, and the prairie falcon. Besides the aforementioned birds, the habitat is also important for several animals,  including the mule deer, pronghone antelope, Ord&#x27;s kangaroo rat, pygmy short-horned lizard, western hognosed snake, and the prairie rattlesnake.

The South Saskatchewan River (Empress to Lancer Ferry) (SK 046) IBA () is in Saskatchewan and follows the course of the South Saskatchewan River from the Alberta / Saskatchewan border east to the Lancer Ferry crossing and includes the river&#x27;s valley and the fork with the Red Deer River. The site covers an area of . The valley floor is heavily wooded and includes trees such as the eastern cottonwood, Manitoba maple, peach-leaved willow, and the green ash. Birds found at the site include the long-billed curlew, piping plover, loggerhead shrike, short-eared owl, ferruginous hawk, red-headed woodpecker, prairie falcon, turkey vulture, golden eagle, great horned owl, western screech owl, pileated woodpecker, western wood pewee, rock wren, alder flycatcher, yellow-breasted chat, and the great blue heron.

== Fish species ==
Fish species include walleye, sauger, yellow perch, northern pike, lake trout, rainbow trout, goldeye, lake whitefish, cisco, lake sturgeon, burbot, quillback, longnose sucker, white sucker, and shorthead redhorse.

<text>Francisco Caetano Keil Coelho do Amaral, 2nd [[Viscount]] of Pedralva (Lisbon, 28 April 1910 – Lisbon, 19 February 1975), was a Portuguese architect, painter and photographer. His name was given to a street in Lisbon.

Keil do Amaral stood out in a particular way throughout the 1940s and 1950s, having acted in an original way during these particularly difficult decades of national life. He assumed the project responsibility of important public works, without identifying himself with the political regime or with the historicist standards of the official taste of the Estado Novo and, at the same time, maintaining a critical distance in relation to the International Style orthodoxy, in search of a &quot;third way&quot; able to reconcile modern rationality with thoughtful consideration of the lessons of traditional architecture.

==Background==
He was the only son of Francisco Coelho do Amaral Reis, 1st Viscount of Pedralva by Carlos I of Portugal in 1904 (Sátão, Águas Boas, 3 August 1873 – 5 April 1938), 100th Governor of Portuguese Angola from 1920 to 1921, son of José Caetano dos Reis and wife Lucrécia Coelho do Amaral, and first wife, as her second husband, Guida Maria Josefina Cinatti Keil, daughter of Alfredo Cristiano Keil and wife Cleyde Maria Margarida Cinatti. After his mother&#x27;s death his father remarried Arminda da Conceição da Silva Camacho dos Reis (– Silves, São Bartolomeu de Messines, 10 October 1935) and they had another son, Eduardo Coelho do Amaral dos Reis (Sátão, Águas Boas, 11 September 1932 –), unmarried and without issue.

He lived a large part of his childhood in Canas de Senhorim, where he completed his primary education. After a stay in Luanda (1920-1921), where his father was Governor-General, he attended Colégio Nacional and Liceu Gil Vicente (1922-1928).

He began his professional life in 1929, as an advertising &quot;designer&quot; (with Fred Kradolfer and José Rocha). In 1930 he enrolled in the special Architecture course at the Lisbon School of Fine Arts, but in the next year he was subject to a disciplinary process, motivated by a conflict with the professor of architecture, Arnaldo Redondo Adães Bermudes. He completes the course, as an external student, working in Carlos Ramos&#x27; studio, whose example will mark his future options and, in particular, the functionalist character and purism of his first works (Instituto Pasteur, Porto, 1933–1935).

Still a student, he participates in important exhibitions at the National Society of Fine Arts (1932, 1933). In 1936, he won the competition for the Pavilhão de Portugal at the Universal Fair in Paris, imposing a renewing taste in the official programs. He remains in Paris for 1 year to monitor the construction of the pavilion. Discover remarkable works of modern European architecture. He visits Netherlands, where he discovers the work of Willem Marinus Dudok (a great admirer of Frank Lloyd Wright). For Keil, the fascination with Dutch architecture (and Frank Lloyd Wright) stems from its progressive, modern character, which reconciles evenly with traditions. &quot;This binomial will clearly define the practice of the architect&quot; leading him, after his return to Portugal, to demarcate aspects of his initial work, the influence of Carlos Ramos and, even more, the historicist and regionalist constraints of the official architecture of the Estado Novo. He will propose a third way, concerned above all with the well-being and happiness of the common man, where &quot;rationalism goes hand in hand with poetry&quot;.

&quot;When, in the middle of the Salazar dictatorship, Portuguese architecture is divided between the mentors of the regime and the desire for a functionalism of an international character, [Keil do Amaral stands out] as the figure who with more energy and lucidity defends the bases for building a different perspective of work, theoretically rational and formally linked to local identities, appealing to a simple and balanced language, inspired by the continuity and the integrative sense that seems to be a constant of Portuguese architecture &quot;.

&quot;From a formal point of view, Keil do Amaral&#x27;s vast production in the 1940s, in addition to documenting contacts with the architecture of Northern Europe and the United States, translates a personal conception of spaces and volumes that transcends conceptual limitations of modernism. And while maintaining the basic assumptions of modern architecture, it does not ignore the experience, especially vernacular, of the past&quot;.

Between 1939 and 1949, he joined a team of young architects at the Lisbon City Council - which also included, among others, Inácio Peres Fernandes and João Faria da Costa - responsible for supporting the initiatives of the then Minister of Public Works and President of the Lisbon City Council, Duarte Pacheco, relating to urban expansion and functional re-equipping of the city. Keil do Amaral will work on equipment projects and on the rearrangement of green spaces in the capital: Parque Eduardo VII; Large field; Monsanto Park. On the eve of the beginning of the Second World War, he travels to Great Britain and Northern Ireland, France; Netherlands and Germany, to visit parks and deepen knowledge in that specific area.

On March 4, 1941, he was made an Officer of the Military Order of Sant&#x27;Iago da Espada.

&quot;The Parque de Monsanto project is an essential work in the context of the major interventions carried out in Lisbon during the 20th century. Transferring the large park to the outskirts of the city, it reveals a new understanding of the issue of urban green spaces integrated on the larger scale. vast area of the metropolitan area and the expansion of the city &quot;. Keil develops the general plan and equipment designs. &quot;At the end of the 1940s, the works of the Clube de Ténis or Restaurante de Montes Claros will translate into happy moments on Keil do Amaral&#x27;s journey, subtly reaching that sense of purification, of abandonment that he had been exploring since the first years. research on Dutch passion, in fact, from 1948 onwards Keil took on a greater modernity according to the codes of the Modern Movement, giving a new meaning to his production: in the Montes Claros Restaurant, he freed the floor plan, in the Clube de Ténis tears big glazing and resolves the coverage with tremendous agility&quot;.

The arrangement of Parque Eduardo VII was another of his important works in the context of urban structuring of the city. Draws the central, grassy lane, flanked by a Portuguese stone sidewalk; redesigns the lake; rearranges the Greenhouse and designs the entrance close to the bank; in the eastern sector it develops a sequence of stays. The set should be finished off, in the north, by the City Palace, to be implanted next to the viewpoint space marked by the monumental columns. To support this project, he travels to the United States of America, where he visits reference works of modern architecture, from Frank Lloyd Wright to Eliel Saarinen. Initially designed (1948) by a team that also included Hernâni Gandra and Alberto José Pessoa, the City Palace would become the subject of controversy and was never built.

Keil do Amaral&#x27;s architectural production throughout the 1940s is intense; in addition to the interventions for the city parks, it designs the Lisbon Airport terminal, theaters in Mangualde and Nelas, single family homes, etc. 1946 is the year of the beginning of the Sobre e Descente studio, in Arco do Cego street, for projects by the Lisbon City Council (with Hernâni Gandra and Alberto José Pessoa), which he maintains in parallel with his personal studio. Simultaneously with the practice of architecture, its civic, cultural and political action is intensified. Publishes articles and books; participates in the bodies of the National Architects Union; is one of the most active promoters of the General Expositions of Plastic Arts (1946-1956), which marked a cultural dynamic of opposition to the Estado Novo, exhibiting in the exhibitions of 1946, 1947, 1948, 1949, 1950, 1953 and 1956.

Keil has an important role in the formation of the group of Cultural Initiatives Art and Technique (ICAT) and in the reformulation of the magazine Arquitetura, where he launched, in 1947, the idea of a scientific inquiry into Portuguese regional architecture, a reference work in which he endeavors to second half of the 1950s in association with a large group of architects (published by the National Architects Union in 1961 under the title Popular Architecture in Portugal). He will also be one of the protagonists of the 1st National Congress of Architecture (1948), &quot;which constitutes an undeniable victory for the class, insofar as, for the first time, architects come together to freely discuss ideas and firmly affirm the need to make Modern architecture in the context of a new professional conscience. [...] Historical congress, it would certainly have been another without the contagious presence of Keil do Amaral, soon adopted as the leader of the new generation &quot;. In March of the same year, he was elected president of the National Union of Architects, but he will be compulsorily removed by the government after only eight months, for political reasons, not even officially taking office.

In the immediate period, there was a slowdown in the public order from which he had benefited until then, but the ostracism was attenuated a few years later, with the realization of important projects, such as for the Lisbon Industry Fair, which he projects with great freedom compositional and where it is visible &quot;the concern to merge architecture and structure with an aesthetic and economic purpose&quot;. He is also the author of several buildings for the União Elétrica Portuguesa and of the vast order that was the first phase of the Metropolitano de Lisboa, which included all stations inaugurated in 1959. In the 1960s he designed, with Carlos Manuel Ramos, Al-Shaab Stadium, Iraq, &quot;in which a breath of renewal is felt&quot; in its architecture that will translate into a &quot;lightness of solution unparalleled in previous works of this type in our country&quot;.

Although he never had the opportunity to teach architecture at the School of Fine Arts in Lisbon, Keil do Amaral had an important pedagogical action, publishing books and reference articles, namely The Architecture and Life (1942), The Modern Dutch Architecture (1943), The Housing Problem (1945) or The training of architects (1948 - communication to the 1st National Architecture Congress). Also in the Revista Municipal (1939-1973) published by the Lisbon City Council, contents by him. And his studio was, in the words of José Antunes da Silva, a true &quot;center of culture and a school of humanity&quot;, where over the years architects of successive generations have collaborated, still in the formation phase or already in maturity, namely: Alberto Pessoa, Hernâni Gandra, José Rafael Botelho, Cândido Palma de Melo, José Antunes da Silva, Pedro Botelho, José Manuel Fernandes, João Paulo Conceição.

Polemicist, researcher, pedagogue, active participant in union and political activity, frontal opponent of the regime linked to prestigious national culture personalities, his writings and reflection books on architecture and the city, contribute to the framing of a generous and intense as a professional and citizen&quot;.

==Family==
He married in 1933 to Maria da Silva Pires (Silves, 9 August 1914 – 10 June 2012), a painter, and had issue, an only son: 
* Francisco Pires Keil do Amaral, born in 1935, an Architect, Representative of the Title of Viscount of Pedralva, unmarried and without issue

==Awards==
* Lisbon Municipal Architecture Award, 1951 - home of A. Sousa Pinto, Avenida D. Vasco da Gama, no. 2, Restelo, Lisbon.
* Diário de Notícias Award, 1960, for his work as a whole.
* Valmor Prize, 1962 - housing at Rua Almirante António Saldanha, n.º 44, Restelo, in Lisbon.

<text>Ilm-Kreis is a district in Thuringia, Germany. It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the city of Erfurt, the districts of Weimarer Land, Saalfeld-Rudolstadt and Hildburghausen, the city of Suhl, and the districts of Schmalkalden-Meiningen and Gotha. It is named after the river Ilm, flowing through the district.

==History==

In medieval times the territory was ruled by the counts of Henneberg and the princes of Schwarzburg, two local dynasties. While Ilmenau was ruled by Henneberg, Arnstadt belonged to Schwarzburg. When the Henneberg family became extinct in 1583, Ilmenau was acquired by Saxony. In the meantime the principality of Schwarzburg began to disintegrate and was split up into several tiny states. One of those states (Schwarzburg-Arnstadt) was based in Arnstadt; it was founded in 1574 and existed until 1716, when it fell to Schwarzburg-Sondershausen. This mini state existed until 1920, when the state of Thuringia was founded.

The district was founded in 1920 (under the name Arnstadt); it was divided in 1952 into the districts of Arnstadt and Ilmenau, but reunited in 1994.

==Geography==

In its southern portions the district includes parts of the southeastern Thuringian Forest, among them the highest elevation of that mountain chain, the Großer Beerberg (982 m). To the north the country is sloping away and becomes rather plain, mainly agricultural area.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms displays:
*the heraldic lion from the principality of Schwarzburg
*the hen from the county of Henneberg
*the eagle from the city arms of Arnstadt

<text>The Clocaenog Forest is in west Denbighshire and east Conwy, Wales on Mynydd Hiraethog. It takes its name from the village of Clocaenog, near Ruthin.

== History ==
It is in extent, mostly coniferous softwoods under the control of Natural Resources Wales. It was planted in 1905 on what was mostly moorland and many hill farms. It is a highland region, mostly above 350 metres. It experienced a severe winter in 1946/47 with over 150 cm of lying snow on flat ground recorded at Clawdd-newydd (a nearby village), and there was another hard winter in 1962/63. It is also one of the last mainland strongholds of red squirrels in Wales.

== Geography ==
There are high points which rise above the tree level, affording views of Snowdonia and Arenig Fawr to the west, the Berwyn Range to the south, the Clwydian Range to the east, and the Denbigh moors to the north. The highest point in the forest is &#x27;The Mast&#x27; at Craig Bron Bannog 501m (1,644 feet).
Wildlife includes many birds, including the common crossbill, which is adapted well to the conifers. Nesting platforms have been built at the top of bare trees. There is also an enclosed area where wild horses (Przewalski&#x27;s Horses) can be viewed. In addition, there are several examples of ancient remains, including at least one stone circle and the &quot;credstone&quot;, an ancient worship site.

Streams run through the forest, including the source of the River Clwyd; Llyn Brenig lies on the western flank.

== Events ==
The Clocaenog Forest was the murder and burial location of Edward Carthy who, at 28, was the youngest victim of serial killer Peter Moore.

In March 2002, a 47-year-old man with schizophrenia by the name of Richard Sumner died after handcuffing himself to a tree in the forest and throwing away the key. He wasn&#x27;t found until April 2005, when a woman and her dog found his skeleton. It was believed he struggled to break free after scuff marks on the tree were found.

In 2015 the body of an unidentified murder victim was discovered in the forest by two brothers who were attending the 2015 Wales Rally GB.

In 2005 a wind farm with 25 wind turbines was constructed. The three groups of turbines, north to south, are Tir Mostyn (8), Foel Goch (7) and Marial Gwyn (10). Many more wind turbines are planned.
In 2019 deliveries of components for the Clocaenog Forest Wind Farm begun, consisting of 27 Vestas V105 turbines, transported from Ellesmere Port to the development site. Deliveries took place over six months, with a total of 270 components. Halifax-based specialist Collett Transport delivered the components, the final three tower sections being delivered on 26 July 2019.

<doc id="327044" wikidata="Q1122364" url="?curid=327044" title="Indentured servitude">
<text>Indentured servitude is a form of labor in which a person is contracted to work without salary for a specific number of years. The contract called an &quot;indenture&quot;, may be entered voluntarily for a prepaid lump sum, as payment for some good or service (e.g. travel), purported eventual compensation, or debt repayment. An indenture may also be imposed involuntarily as a judicial punishment. The practice has been compared to the similar institution of slavery, although there are differences.

Historically, in an apprenticeship, an apprentice worked with no pay for a master tradesman to learn a trade. This was often for a fixed length of time, usually seven years or less. Apprenticeship was not the same as indentureship, although many apprentices were tricked into falling into debt and thus having to indenture themselves for years more to pay off such sums. 

Like any loan, an indenture could be sold. Most masters had to depend on middlemen or ships&#x27; masters to recruit and transport the workers, so indentureships were commonly sold by such men to planters or others upon the ships&#x27; arrival. Like slaves, their prices went up or down, depending on supply and demand. When the indenture (loan) was paid off, the worker was free but not always in good health or of sound body. Sometimes they might be given a plot of land or a small sum to buy it, but the land was usually poor.

==Americas==
=== North America ===
Until the late 18th century, indentured servitude was common in British America. It was often a way for Europeans to migrate to the American colonies: they signed an indenture in return for a costly passage. However, the system was also used to exploit many of them, as well as Asians (mostly from India and China) who wanted to migrate to the New World. These Asian people were used mainly to construct roads and railway systems. After their indenture expired, the immigrants were free to work for themselves or another employer. At least one economist has suggested that &quot;indentured servitude was an economic arrangement designed to iron out imperfections in the capital market&quot;.
In some cases, the indenture was made with a ship&#x27;s master, who sold the indenture to an employer in the colonies. Most indentured servants worked as farm laborers or domestic servants, although some were apprenticed to craftsmen.

The terms of an indenture were not always enforced by American courts, although runaways were usually sought out and returned to their employer.

Between one-half and two-thirds of European immigrants to the American Colonies between the 1630s and the American Revolution came under indentures. However, while almost half the European immigrants to the Thirteen Colonies were indentured servants, at any one time they were outnumbered by workers who had never been indentured, or whose indenture had expired, and thus free wage labor was the more prevalent for Europeans in the colonies. Indentured people were numerically important mostly in the region from Virginia north to New Jersey. Other colonies saw far fewer of them. The total number of European immigrants to all 13 colonies before 1775 was about 500,000; of these 55,000 were involuntary prisoners. Of the 450,000 or so European arrivals who came voluntarily, Tomlins estimates that 48% were indentured. About 75% of these were under the age of 25. The age of adulthood for men was 24 years (not 21); those over 24 generally came on contracts lasting about three years. Regarding the children who came, Gary Nash reports that &quot;many of the servants were nephews, nieces, cousins, and children of friends of emigrating Englishmen, who paid their passage in return for their labor once in America.&quot;

Several instances of kidnapping for transportation to the Americas are recorded, such as that of Peter Williamson (1730–1799). Historian Richard Hofstadter pointed out that &quot;Although efforts were made to regulate or check their activities, and they diminished in importance in the eighteenth century, it remains true that a certain small part of the European colonial population of America was brought by force, and a much larger portion came in response to deceit and misrepresentation on the part of the spirits [recruiting agents].&quot; One &quot;spirit&quot; named William Thiene was known to have spirited away 840 people from Britain to the colonies in a single year. Historian Lerone Bennett Jr. notes that &quot;Masters given to flogging often did not care whether their victims were black or white.&quot;

Also, during the 18th and early 19th centuries, children from the UK were often kidnapped and sold into indentured labor in the American and Caribbean colonies (often without any indentures).

Indentured servitude was also used by governments in Britain for captured prisoners of war in rebellions and civil wars. Oliver Cromwell sent into indentured service thousands of prisoners captured in the 1648 Battle of Preston and the 1651 Battle of Worcester. King James II acted similarly after the Monmouth Rebellion in 1685, and the use of such measures continued into the 18th century.

Indentured servants could not marry without the permission of their master, were frequently subject to physical punishment, and did not receive legal favor from the courts. Female indentured servants in particular might be raped and/or sexually abused by their masters. If children were produced the labour would be extended by two years. Cases of successful prosecution for these crimes were very uncommon, as indentured servants were unlikely to have access to a magistrate, and social pressure to avoid such brutality could vary by geography and cultural norm. The situation was particularly difficult for indentured women, because in both low social class and gender, they were believed to be particularly prone to vice, making legal redress unusual.

The American Revolution severely limited immigration to the United States, but economic historians dispute its long-term impact. Sharon Salinger argues that the economic crisis that followed the war made long-term labor contracts unattractive. Her analysis of Philadelphia&#x27;s population shows that the percentage of bound citizens fell from 17% to 6.4% throughout the war. William Miller posits a more moderate theory, stating that &quot;the Revolution...wrought disturbances upon white servitude. But these were temporary rather than lasting&quot;. David Galenson supports this theory by proposing that the numbers of British indentured servants never recovered, and that Europeans of other nationalities replaced them.

Indentured servitude began its decline after Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion, a servant uprising against the government of Colonial Virginia. This was due to multiple factors, such as the treatment of servants, support of native tribes in the surrounding area, a refusal to expand the amount of land an indentured servant could work by the colonial government, and inequality between the upper and lower class in colonial society. Indentured servitude was the primary source of labor for early American colonists until the rebellion. Little changed in the immediate aftermath of Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion; however, the rebellion did cause a general distrust of servant labor and fear of future rebellion. The fear of indentured servitude eventually cemented itself into the hearts of Americans, leading towards the reliance on enslaved Africans. This helped to ingrain the idea of racial segregation and unite white Americans under race rather than economic or social class. Doing so prevented the potential for future rebellion and changed the way that agriculture was approached.

The American and British governments passed several laws that helped foster the decline of indentures. The UK Parliament&#x27;s Passenger Vessels Act 1803 regulated travel conditions aboard ships to make transportation more expensive, and to hinder landlords&#x27; tenants seeking a better life. An American law passed in 1833 abolished the imprisonment of debtors, which made prosecuting runaway servants more difficult, increasing the risk of indenture contract purchases. The Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, passed in the wake of the American Civil War, made involuntary indentured servitude illegal in the United States.

==Contracts==
Through its introduction, the details regarding indentured labor varied across import and export regions and most overseas contracts were made before the voyage with the understanding that prospective migrants were competent enough to make overseas contracts on their own account and that they preferred to have a contract before the voyage.

Most labor contracts made were in increments of five years, with the opportunity to extend another five years. Many contracts also provided free passage home after the dictated labor was completed. However, there were generally no policies regulating employers once the labor hours were completed, which led to frequent ill-treatment.

===Caribbean===
In 1643, the European population of Barbados was 37,200 (86% of the population). During the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, at least 10,000 Scottish and Irish prisoners of war were transported as indentured laborers to the colonies.

A half million Europeans went as indentured servants to the Caribbean (primarily the English-speaking islands of the Caribbean) before 1840.

In 1838, with the abolition of slavery at its onset, the British were in the process of transporting a million Indians out of India and into the Caribbean to take the place of the recently freed Africans (freed in 1833) in indentureship. Women, looking for what they believed would be a better life in the colonies, were specifically sought after and recruited at a much higher rate than men due to the high population of men already in the colonies. However, women had to prove their status as single and eligible to emigrate, as married women could not leave without their husbands. Many women seeking escape from abusive relationships were willing to take that chance. The Indian Immigration Act of 1883 prevented women from exiting India as widowed or single in order to escape. Arrival in the colonies brought unexpected conditions of poverty, homelessness, and little to no food as the high numbers of emigrants overwhelmed the small villages and flooded the labor market. Many were forced into signing labor contracts that exposed them to the hard field labor on the plantation. Additionally, on arrival to the plantation, single women were &#x27;assigned&#x27; a man as they were not allowed to live alone. The subtle difference between slavery and indenture-ship is best seen here as women were still subjected to the control of the plantation owners as well as their newly assigned &#x27;partner&#x27;.

Indentured servitude of Irish and other European peoples occurred in seventeenth-century Barbados, and was fundamentally different from enslavement: an enslaved African&#x27;s body was owned, as were the bodies of their children, while the labour of indentured servants was under contractual ownership of another person. Laws and racial hierarchy would allow for the &quot;indentured&quot; and &quot;slaves&quot; to be treated differently, as well as their identities to be defined differently.  

Barbados is an example of a colony in which the separation between enslaved Africans and &quot;servants&quot; was codified into law. Distinct legal &quot;acts&quot; were created in 1661 treating each party as a separate group.

The British ruling class anxieties over Irish loyalties would lead to harsh policing of Irish servants&#x27; movements, for instance, needing &quot;reason&quot; to leave the plantations from which they were employed. Similarly, the laws regarding slavery would prevent enslaved Africans from doing the same. While enslaved Africans - and for a period, free Africans - were not allowed to use the court system in any manner, even to act as a witness, Barbados would allow &quot;white servants&quot; to go to court if they felt that they had received poor treatment. Additionally, children of African descent were offered no supplementary protection, while children of English, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh extraction who were sent to Barbados as indentured servants could not work without a parent&#x27;s consent.

Such differences in social classes would ensure that alliances between the two groups would not lead to revolts towards plantation owners and managers.

As well, during periods of mass indentured servitude of Irish peoples in the Caribbean, certain Irish individuals would use enslaved labour to profit financially and climb the ladder of social class. Historians Kristen Block and Jenny Shaw write that: &quot;the Irish — by virtue of their European heritage — gained […] greater social and economic mobility.&quot; An example is a former indentured servant in Barbados, Cornelius Bryan, would go on to own land and enslaved people himself, demonstrating the tiers between servant and slave classes.

==Colonial Indian indenture system==
The Indian indenture system was a system of indenture by which two million Indians called coolies were transported to various colonies of European powers to provide labour for the (mainly sugar) plantations. It started from the end of slavery in 1833 and continued until 1920. This resulted in the development of a large Indian diaspora, which spread from the Indian Ocean (i.e. Réunion and Mauritius) to Pacific Ocean (i.e. Fiji), as well as the growth of Indo-Caribbean and Indo-African population.

The British wanted local black Africans to work in Natal as workers. But the locals refused, and as a result, the British introduced the Indian indenture system, resulting in a permanent Indian South African presence. On 18 January 1826, the Government of the French Indian Ocean island of Réunion laid down terms for the introduction of Indian labourers to the colony. Each man was required to appear before a magistrate and declare that he was going voluntarily. The contract was for five years with pay of ₹8 (12¢ US) per month and rations provided labourers had been transported from Pondicherry and Karaikal. The first attempt at importing Indian labour into Mauritius, in 1829, ended in failure, but by 1834, with abolition of slavery throughout most of the British Empire, transportation of Indian labour to the island gained pace. By 1838, 25,000 Indian labourers had been transported to Mauritius.

After the end of slavery, the West Indian sugar colonies tried the use of emancipated slaves, families from Ireland, Germany and Malta and Portuguese from Madeira. All these efforts failed to satisfy the labour needs of the colonies due to high mortality of the new arrivals and their reluctance to continue working at the end of their indenture. On 16 November 1844, the British Indian Government legalised emigration to Jamaica, Trinidad and Demerara (Guyana). The first ship, , sailed from Calcutta for British Guiana on 13 January 1838, and arrived in Berbice on 5 May 1838. Transportation to the Caribbean stopped in 1848 due to problems in the sugar industry and resumed in Demerara and Trinidad in 1851 and Jamaica in 1860.

This system of labour was coined by contemporaries at the time as a &quot;new system of slavery&quot;, a term later used by historian Hugh Tinker in his influential book of the same name.

The Indian indenture system was finally banned in 1917. Although the system was officially suspended, those who were serving indentures at that time were required to complete their terms of service, thereby extending the system into the early 1920s. According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, &quot;When the Imperial Legislative Council finally ended indenture...it did so because of pressure from Indian nationalists and declining profitability, rather than from humanitarian concerns.&quot;

==Oceania==

Convicts transported to the Australian colonies before the 1840s often found themselves hired out in a form of indentured labor.
Indentured servants also emigrated to New South Wales.
The Van Diemen&#x27;s Land Company used skilled indentured labor for periods of seven years or less. A similar scheme for the Swan River area of Western Australia existed between 1829 and 1832.

During the 1860s planters in Australia, Fiji, New Caledonia, and the Samoa Islands, in need of laborers, encouraged a trade in long-term indentured labor called &quot;blackbirding&quot;. At the height of the labor trade, more than one-half the adult male population of several of the islands worked abroad.

Over a period of 40 years, from the mid-19th century to the early 20th century, labor for the sugar-cane fields of Queensland, Australia included an element of coercive recruitment and indentured servitude of the 62,000 South Sea Islanders. The workers came mainly from Melanesia – mainly from the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu – with a small number from Polynesian and Micronesian areas such as Samoa, the Gilbert Islands (subsequently known as Kiribati) and the Ellice Islands (subsequently known as Tuvalu). They became collectively known as &quot;Kanakas&quot;.

Indentured labour existed in Papua New Guinea.

It remains unknown how many Islanders the trade controversially kidnapped. Whether the system legally recruited Islanders, persuaded, deceived, coerced or forced them to leave their homes and travel by ship to Queensland remains difficult to determine. Official documents and accounts from the period often conflict with the oral tradition passed down to the descendants of workers. Stories of blatantly violent kidnapping tend to relate to the first 10–15 years of the trade.

Australia deported many of these Islanders back to their places of origin in the period 1906–1908 under the provisions of the Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901.

==Africa==
A significant number of construction projects in British East Africa and South Africa, required vast quantities of labor, exceeding the availability or willingness of local tribesmen. Indentured Indians from India were imported, for such projects as the Uganda Railway, as farm labor, and as miners. They and their descendants formed a significant portion of the population and economy of Kenya and Uganda, although not without engendering resentment from others. Idi Amin&#x27;s expulsion of the &quot;Asians&quot; from Uganda in 1972 was an expulsion of Indo-Africans.

The majority of the population of Mauritius are descendants of Indian indentured labourers brought in between 1834 and 1921. Initially brought to work the sugar estates following the abolition of slavery in the British Empire an estimated half a million indentured laborers were present on the island during this period. Aapravasi Ghat, in the bay at Port Louis and now a UNESCO site, was the first British colony to serve as a major reception centre for indentured Indians from India who came to work on plantations following the abolition of slavery.

==Legal status==
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948) declares in Article 4 &quot;No one shall be held in slavery or servitude; slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms&quot;. More specifically, it is dealt with by article 1(a) of the United Nations 1956 Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery.

However, only national legislation can establish the unlawfulness of indentured labor in a specific jurisdiction. In the United States, the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act (VTVPA) of 2000 extended servitude to cover peonage as well as Involuntary Servitude.

<doc id="327045" wikidata="Q1789631" url="?curid=327045" title="Pigs in a Polka">
<text>Pigs in a Polka is a 1943 Warner Bros. &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoon series directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on February 6, 1943.

The film is a parody of two Walt Disney Productions films: 1933&#x27;s &quot;Three Little Pigs&quot; and 1940&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia&quot;. The familiar story of The Three Little Pigs is set in this film to several of Brahms&#x27; &quot;Hungarian Dances&quot;, specifically No. 5, No. 7, No. 6 and No. 17 which appear in that order. It is also part of a light-hearted, culturally subversive &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; running joke, which would later be re-emphasized with another &quot;Fantasia&quot; parody, 1943&#x27;s &quot;A Corny Concerto&quot;. There is very little dialogue in the cartoon aside from the Big Bad Wolf&#x27;s introduction of the story and the Three Little Pigs introducing themselves.

It was nominated for the 1942 Academy Award for Best Short Subject: Cartoons.

==Plot==
After an introduction by the wolf, the plot loosely follows the traditional story of the three little pigs. The first pig, using a prefabricated home kit, erects a wire structure, then quickly covers it with straw. The second pig uses hundreds of matches to make up his house, though when he puts the last match in place on the roof, the entire building collapses. The third pig goes through the tedious task of laying bricks for his house.

Satisfied with their homes, the first two pigs dance around, act silly, and laugh with each other; the first pig plays a violin, and the second pig a flute. The wolf arrives dressed as a gypsy, and sets about, through dance, trying to lure the first two pigs into a position to be captured. The pigs are suspicious and, when the wolf thinks he has them, the pigs instead rough him up and emerge each wearing parts of his costume; they briefly dance until the wolf approaches threateningly. He chases them to the straw house, which he incinerates in seconds with a lit match. The pigs flee to the match house. Though it has a front door, it is still in a state of collapse; the pigs speedily pile the matches up to form a house, then the wolf drops one last match onto the roof and it all falls apart. The pigs race to the brick house. The wolf attempts to bash in the front door, then resorts to huffing and puffing to blow the house down (to which the pigs respond by offering Lusterine mouthwash), but he fails. The wolf sets up to run at the front door; the three pigs work together to squelch this effort.

The third pig is not thrilled to have the other two in his house, especially when they again begin dancing around with their instruments, acting silly and laughing. Then, they notice an apparently homeless woman (the wolf) outside the window, playing a violin in the snow. The &#x27;snow&#x27; is actually talcum powder held on a stick above the wolf&#x27;s head. The first two pigs take pity and push the third pig (who realizes it is the wolf) away from the door to let the despondent person in. The wolf continues the deception and continues playing the violin. The third pig, upon peeking under the clothing and seeing that the wolf has a record player on his back, flips the record over. Fast-paced music begins and the wolf dances to it, resulting in him being exposed when his costume falls off piece-by-piece. The wolf then chases the pigs up to the second floor of the house. The pigs make their escape in an elevator, but when the wolf tries to use it he drops into an empty shaft. The wolf is unaware that he is falling, but rather thinks he is riding the elevator down. He politely doffs his hat as gentlemen in an elevator did back in the 1940s and just stands there politely looking up. After a long fall, the doors open and he falls at the feet of the pigs as the cartoon irises out.

Throughout the short, the pigs&#x27; motions are synchronized to the music.

==Reception==
Animation historian Greg Ford writes, &quot;Friz Freleng invaded Disney territory with &quot;Pigs in a Polka&quot;, an irreverent reworking of Disney&#x27;s breakthrough &quot;The Three Little Pigs&quot; (1933), here reimagined and propelled in its entirety by Brahms&#x27; &quot;Hungarian Dances&quot;. From the obligatory scene-setting rigamarole of the three pigs slapping together their three separate houses of straw, matchsticks and bricks, it&#x27;s abundantly clear that Friz means to reapply the same tweaked synchronization of classical music to animated action that he achieved in the Franz Liszt-driven &quot;Rhapsody in Rivets&quot; (1941). The music-action symbiosis is, if anything, more accentuated than before.&quot;

==Home media==
This film can be found in the Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 3 disc 3, &quot;Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Academy Awards Animation Collection&quot; and several low-budget home video and DVD releases.

This is one of the 61 pre-1948 WB cartoons to fall into the public domain as United Artists did not renew the copyright in time.

<text>HMS &quot;Kelly&quot; (pennant number F01) was a K-class destroyer of the British Royal Navy, and flotilla leader of her class. She served through the early years of the Second World War; in Home Waters, off Norway and in the Mediterranean. Throughout her service, &quot;Kelly&quot; was commanded by Lord Louis Mountbatten, as commander (Captain (D)) of the 5th Destroyer Flotilla. She was lost in action in 1941 during the Battle of Crete.

&quot;Kelly&quot; was built by Hawthorn Leslie and Company at Hebburn on the River Tyne. She was laid down on 26 August 1937, launched on 25 October 1938 and commissioned on 23 August 1939, just 11 days before commencement of hostilities. She was named after Admiral of the Fleet Sir John Kelly.

==Service==

===Home Waters (1939)===
On the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor were brought from France, where they were living, back to Britain on board HMS &quot;Kelly&quot;.

On the afternoon of 14 December 1939, the tanker struck a mine laid by German destroyers off the Tyne Estuary. &quot;Kelly&quot; and the were dispatched as escorts for the rescue tugs &quot;Great Emperor&quot;, &quot;Joffre&quot; and &quot;Langton&quot;. During the operation, &quot;Kelly&quot; also struck a mine and sustained damage to her hull. While &quot;Mohawk&quot; put a party aboard &quot;Atheltemplar&quot;, and &quot;Joffre&quot; and &quot;Langton&quot; took the tanker under tow, &quot;Kelly&quot; herself was taken in tow by &quot;Great Emperor&quot; and returned to the Tyne. Reaching the Tyne just before midnight, &quot;Kelly&quot; was assisted upriver by the tugs &quot;Robert Redhead&quot; and &quot;Washington&quot;. She was towed to Hawthorn Leslie&#x27;s yard for repairs, which took just a little over three months.

This was the second of &quot;Kelly&quot;″s misfortunes, having just returned to active service after a month in dry dock following storm damage. Repairs were completed on 28 February 1940, and &quot;Kelly&quot; returned to the fray. Astonishingly, she was involved in a collision with just two days later on 2 March, necessitating a further 8 weeks in dry dock, this time on the Thames. She was released on 27 April, in time to assist with the evacuation of allied forces from Namsos.

===Norwegian campaign (1940)===

On the night 9 May/10 May 1940, during the Battle of Norway, &quot;Kelly&quot; was torpedoed amidships by the German E-boat &quot;S 31&quot;, under command of &quot;Oberleutnant zur See&quot; Hermann Opdenhoff (for which action Oblt.z.S. Opdenhoff was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross). Severely damaged, she was taken under tow by the tug &quot;Great Emperor&quot; and for four days she was attacked by E-boats and bombers as she struggled back to port at three knots. The Navy Controller wrote that she survived &quot;not only by the good seamanship of the officers and men but also on account of the excellent workmanship which ensured the watertightness of the other compartments. A single defective rivet might have finished her.&quot; She was repaired and returned to service.

On return to Hebburn shipyard, she was de-commissioned before undergoing extensive repairs; she was not fit for active service until December 1940. Her bad luck had seen her on active service for less than two weeks over the previous 14 months.

During this period her captain, Louis Mountbatten, as Captain (D), was forced to lead his flotilla from temporary placement in other ships of the flotilla; for a time he led from , until she too succumbed to damage.

&quot;Kelly&quot; re-joined 5th Flotilla after re-commissioning in December 1940; after working-up trials and some service in the Channel, she and 5th Flotilla sailed for the Mediterranean, arriving at Malta in April 1941.

===Mediterranean (1941)===
In April 1941 she joined HM ships , , , , , and at Gibraltar to form Force S, an escort for reinforcements to the Mediterranean Fleet (Operation Salient). She arrived in Malta on the 28th and was deployed with her flotilla to join Force K for attacks on Axis shipping to North Africa.

On 8 May, following the loss of HMS &quot;Jersey&quot; to a mine and the subsequent clearance of her wreck, the flotilla left Malta and joined , &quot;Dido&quot;, and to escort supply convoys to Egypt and Greece (Operation Tiger). On 10 May she led the destroyers to bombard Benghazi before returning to Malta. On 21 May she was despatched to Crete with &quot;Kashmir&quot; and &quot;Kipling&quot; and began patrols north of the island the next day.

On 23 May, during the evacuation of Crete, she was bombed and sunk, with half her crew killed. &quot;Kelly&quot; did succeed in shooting down three of the attacking Stukas, while another was badly damaged and crashed upon returning to base. The survivors were deeply affected by the loss of their ship; Mountbatten shared their loss and tried to console the ship&#x27;s company by reminding them all that &quot;we didn&#x27;t leave the &quot;Kelly&quot;, the &quot;Kelly&quot; left us!&quot;

==Legacy==
The 1942 film &quot;In Which We Serve&quot; starring Noël Coward and John Mills and telling the story of &quot;HMS &quot;Torrin&quot;&quot;, is based on the career of &quot;Kelly&quot;. The HMS &quot;Kelly&quot; Association hosts reunions and commemorations. Notable supporters of the association have included Charles III and Sir John Mills.
In Hebburn, the town in South Tyneside where HMS &quot;Kelly&quot; was built, there remains a public house by the name of &quot;The Kelly&quot; while the local Tyne &amp; Wear metro station features artwork depicting the ship herself.

<text>Web syndication is making content available from one website to other sites. Most commonly, websites are made available to provide either summaries or full renditions of a website&#x27;s recently added content. The term may also describe other kinds of content licensing for reuse.

==Motivation==
For the subscribing sites, syndication is an effective way of adding greater depth and immediacy of information to their pages, making them more attractive to users. For the provider site, syndication increases exposure. This generates new traffic for the provider site—making syndication an easy and relatively cheap, or even free, form of advertisement.

Content syndication has become an effective strategy for link building, as search engine optimization has become an increasingly important topic among website owners and online marketers. Links embedded within the syndicated content are typically optimized around anchor terms that will point an optimized link back to the website that the content author is trying to promote. These links tell the algorithms of the search engines that the website being linked to is an authority for the keyword that is being used as the anchor text. However the rollout of Google Panda&#x27;s algorithm may not reflect this authority in its SERP rankings based on quality scores generated by the sites linking to the authority.

The prevalence of web syndication is also of note to online marketers, since web surfers are becoming increasingly wary of providing personal information for marketing materials (such as signing up for a newsletter) and expect the ability to subscribe to a feed instead. Although the format could be anything transported over HTTP, such as HTML or JavaScript, it is more commonly XML. Web syndication formats include RSS, Atom, and JSON Feed.

==History==
Syndication first arose in earlier media such as print, radio, and television, allowing content creators to reach a wider audience. In the case of radio, the United States Federal government proposed a syndicate in 1924 so that the country&#x27;s executives could quickly and efficiently reach the entire population. In the case of television, it is often said that &quot;Syndication is where the real money is.&quot; Additionally, syndication accounts for the bulk of TV programming.

One predecessor of web syndication is the Meta Content Framework (MCF), developed in 1996 by Ramanathan V. Guha and others in Apple Computer&#x27;s Advanced Technology Group.

Today, millions of online publishers, including newspapers, commercial websites, and blogs, distribute their news headlines, product offers, and blog postings in the news feed.

==As a commercial model==
Conventional syndication businesses such as Reuters and Associated Press thrive on the internet by offering their content to media partners on a subscription basis, using business models established in earlier media forms.

Commercial web syndication can be categorized in three ways:
* by &quot;business models&quot;
* by &quot;types of content&quot;
* by &quot;methods for selecting distribution partners&quot;

Commercial web syndication involves partnerships between content producers and distribution outlets. There are different structures of partnership agreements. One such structure is licensing content, in which distribution partners pay a fee to the content creators for the right to publish the content. Another structure is ad-supported content, in which publishers share revenues derived from advertising on syndicated content with that content&#x27;s producer. A third structure is free, or barter syndication, in which no currency changes hands between publishers and content producers. This requires the content producers to generate revenue from another source, such as embedded advertising or subscriptions. Alternatively, they could distribute content without remuneration. Typically, those who create and distribute content free are promotional entities, vanity publishers, or government entities.

Types of content syndicated include RSS or Atom Feeds and full content. With RSS feeds, headlines, summaries, and sometimes a modified version of the original full content is displayed on users&#x27; feed readers. With full content, the entire content—which might be text, audio, video, applications/widgets, or user-generated content—appears unaltered on the publisher&#x27;s site.

There are two methods for selecting distribution partners. The content creator can hand-pick syndication partners based on specific criteria, such as the size or quality of their audiences. Alternatively, the content creator can allow publisher sites or users to opt into carrying the content through an automated system. Some of these automated &quot;content marketplace&quot; systems involve careful screening of potential publishers by the content creator to ensure that the material does not end up in an inappropriate environment.

Just as syndication is a source of profit for TV producers and radio producers, it also functions to maximize profit for Internet content producers. As the Internet has increased in size it has become increasingly difficult for content producers to aggregate a sufficiently large audience to support the creation of high-quality content. Syndication enables content creators to amortize the cost of producing content by licensing it across multiple publishers or by maximizing the distribution of advertising-supported content. A potential drawback for content creators, however, is that they can lose control over the presentation of their content when they syndicate it to other parties.

Distribution partners benefit by receiving content either at a discounted price, or free. One potential drawback for publishers, however, is that because the content is duplicated at other publisher sites, they cannot have an &quot;exclusive&quot; on the content.

For users, the fact that syndication enables the production and maintenance of content allows them to find and consume content on the Internet. One potential drawback for them is that they may run into duplicate content, which could be an annoyance.

==E-commerce==

Web syndication has been used to distribute product content such as feature descriptions, images, and specifications. As manufacturers are regarded as authorities and most sales are not achieved on manufacturer websites, manufacturers allow retailers or dealers to publish the information on their sites. Through syndication, manufacturers may pass relevant information to channel partners. Such web syndication has been shown to increase sales.

Web syndication has also been found effective as a search engine optimization technique.

<text>Livable Rotterdam () is a conservative liberal and localist political party in the municipality of Rotterdam in the Netherlands, which was founded by Ronald Sørensen in 2001. The party was founded at the same time as a number of other &quot;Leefbaar&quot; (&quot;Livable&quot;) parties which contested municipal and local elections as alternatives to the main Dutch parties. 

==History== 
Livable Rotterdam was founded by teacher, union spokesman and former Labour Party member Ronald Sørensen and his wife. Sørensen said that his main reason for forming the party was that he did not agree with the way things were going in national politics. After registering the party, he contacted Pim Fortuyn, who at the time was in the public spotlight, and asked him to front the party&#x27;s campaign for the 2002 local election in Rotterdam. Fortuyn had been selected as leader of the national Livable Netherlands (LN) party and Livable Rotterdam was initially considered the local counterpart to the LN. However, Fortuyn was later sacked as leader of the LN due to controversial comments he made in an interview and founded his own party, the Pim Fortuyn List (LPF). Livable Rotterdam chose to retain Fortuyn as its lead candidate and affiliated itself to the LPF. Livable Rotterdam won the council elections of March 2002 due to the charismatic leadership of Fortuyn and saw him elected along with 17 councilors which included Sørensen and Marco Pastors. This made it the city&#x27;s largest political party, a position which for the previous thirty years had been held by the Labour Party. 

The party consists of numerous members that are new to politics and were attracted to Fortuyn&#x27;s dreams of political change. The party attracts attention and criticism for the upfront behavior of its members and its unconventional, if sometimes right-leaning vision, especially on issues of immigration, crime and inter-culture tolerance.

In the municipal elections of 7 March 2006, Livable Rotterdam lost 5%, dropping to 29.7% of their votes and PvdA gained 15%, making the latter the biggest party again, with 37.4% of the votes. Before the elections, Livable Rotterdam declared it would not enter in a coalition with PvdA and several members even declared that, irrespective of the coalition, they would leave the council if PvdA would become the biggest party (which has happened).

After the municipal elections of 3 March 2010 the Public Prosecutor in Rotterdam launched an investigation into how proxy votes were solicited by the party, after an e-mail emerged in which one of the party’s councillors gives tips on how to accumulate these. Ronald Buijt wrote that he had 50 reliable citizens of the city who could take the proxy votes to the polling stations. The electoral council said this went against the spirit of proxy voting, which should only be used at the initiative of the voter. This irregularity was added to a litany of complaints against the poll in Rotterdam in these elections (many of which were caused by the PvdA), which resulted in a recount of all the votes cast. Back then the PvdA only beat Livable Rotterdam by a mere 650 votes, yet both parties had 14 seats in the city council.

Joost Eerdmans was elected &quot;lijsttrekker&quot; of Livable Rotterdam on 6 October 2013. Under his leadership, the party won the 2014 municipal election, retaining its fourteen seats. Since 8 May 2014, Livable Rotterdam leads a coalition with CDA and D66.

As of 2022, the party leads a new coalition with VVD, D66 and Denk
==Beliefs==
As a municipal party, Livable Rotterdam focuses on matters related to Rotterdam municipality although some of its ideas are comparable to national parties such as the Pim Fortuyn List, Party for Freedom and JA21 with themes related to integration, security and crime: the party calls for tougher policies against organized and violent criminal activity, more police funding, and expanding local democracy and referendums. In 2014, Livable Rotterdam campaigned for a tax relief for Rotterdam residents, stricter crackdowns on youth crime and providing more security for elderly people.

==National affiliations==
Livable Rotterdam was started as a spin-off of the national party Livable Netherlands but is commonly seen as the local party of the Pim Fortuyn List (LPF), the national party founded by Pim Fortuyn after he was fired as lead candidate of the Livable Netherlands party in spring 2002. Livable Rotterdam and the LPF are considered to have similar policy ideas. After the LPF was dissolved in 2008, Livable Rotterdam was allied with the Forum for Democracy (FvD) party for a brief period in 2018 before distancing itself from the FvD. Today, Livable Rotterdam has connections with the JA21 party founded by Livable Rotterdam member Joost Eerdmans. Although not an officially associated party, some elected representatives of Livable Rotterdam such as Barry Madlener, Ingrid Coenradie and Ehsan Jami are members of Geert Wilders&#x27; Party for Freedom (PVV) which campaigns on similar issues at a national level. Sørensen previously served as a Senator for the PVV.

<text>The martini is a cocktail made with gin and vermouth, and garnished with an olive, a lemon twist, or both. Over the years, the martini has become one of the best-known mixed alcoholic beverages. A common variation, the vodka martini, uses vodka instead of gin for the cocktail&#x27;s base spirit.

==Preparation==
By 1922, the martini reached its most recognizable form in which London dry gin and dry vermouth are combined at a ratio of 2:1, stirred in a mixing glass with ice cubes, with the optional addition of orange or aromatic bitters, then strained into a chilled cocktail glass. Over time, the generally expected garnish became the drinker&#x27;s choice of a green olive or a twist of lemon peel.

A dry martini is made with a dash or only a hint of vermouth. Ordering a martini &quot;extra dry&quot; will result in even less or no vermouth added. In the Roaring Twenties, it became a common drink order. Over the course of the 20th century, the amount of vermouth steadily dropped. During the 1930s, the ratio was 3:1 (gin to vermouth), and during the 1940s, the ratio was 4:1. During the latter part of the 20th century, 5:1 or 6:1 dry martinis became considered the norm. Drier variations can go to 8:1, 12:1, 15:1 (the &quot;Montgomery&quot;, after British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery&#x27;s supposed penchant for attacking only when in possession of great numerical superiority).

In 1966, the American Standards Association (ASA) released K100.1-1966, &quot;Safety Code and Requirements for Dry Martinis&quot;, a tongue-in-cheek account of how to make a &quot;standard&quot; dry martini. The latest revision of this document, K100.1-1974, was published by American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the successor to ASA, though it is no longer an active standard.

==Origins and mixology==
The exact origin of the martini is unclear. The name may derive from the Italian Martini brand of vermouth. Another popular theory suggests it evolved from a cocktail called the Martinez served sometime in the early 1860s at the Occidental Hotel in San Francisco, which people frequented before taking an evening ferry to the nearby town of Martinez, California. Alternatively, residents of Martinez say a bartender in their town created the drink, while another source indicates that the drink was named after the town. Indeed, a &quot;Martinez Cocktail&quot; was first described in Jerry Thomas&#x27;s 1887 edition of his &quot;Bartender&#x27;s Guide, How to Mix All Kinds of Plain and Fancy Drinks&quot;:
Other bartending guides of the late 19th century contained recipes for numerous cocktails similar to the modern-day martini. For example, Harry Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Bartenders&#x27; Manual&quot; (1888) listed a recipe for a &quot;Martini Cocktail&quot; that consisted in part of half a wine glass of Old Tom gin and a half a wine glass of vermouth.
The &quot;Marguerite Cocktail&quot;, first described in 1904, could be considered an early form of the dry martini, because it was a 2:1 mix of Plymouth dry gin and dry vermouth, with a dash of orange bitters.

In his 1907 bartenders&#x27; guide &quot;The World&#x27;s Drinks And How To Mix Them&quot;, San Francisco mixologist William Boothby provided possibly the earliest recipe for a &quot;Dry Martini Cocktail&quot; not only resembling a modern-day martini in the ingredients, but also under that name. Attributing it to one Charlie Shaw of Los Angeles, Boothby&#x27;s book gave the recipe as follows:
The first dry martini is sometimes linked to the name of a bartender who concocted the drink at the Knickerbocker Hotel in New York City in 1911 or 1912.

During Prohibition in the United States (1920–1933) the relative ease of illegal gin manufacture led to the martini&#x27;s rise as the locally predominant cocktail. With the repeal of Prohibition, and the ready availability of quality gin, the drink became progressively drier. In the 1970s and 1980s, the martini came to be seen as old-fashioned and was replaced by more intricate cocktails and wine spritzers, but the mid-1990s saw a resurgence in the drink and numerous new versions.

== Variations ==
The traditional martini comes in a number of variations.

A perfect martini uses equal amounts of sweet and dry vermouth.

A dry martini contains more gin. Some recipes advocate the elimination of vermouth altogether; the playwright Noël Coward is credited with the assertion that &quot;a perfect Martini should be made by filling a glass with gin, then waving it in the general direction of Italy.&quot; Similarly, the Churchill martini supposedly favored by Winston Churchill uses no vermouth, and is prepared with gin straight from the freezer and a &quot;glance&quot; at a bottle of vermouth, or a &quot;bow in the direction of France&quot;. Luis Buñuel used the dry martini as part of his creative process, regularly using it to sustain &quot;a reverie in a bar&quot;. He offers his own recipe, involving Angostura bitters, in his memoir.

A wet martini contains more vermouth; a 50-50 martini uses equal amounts of gin and vermouth. An upside-down or reverse martini has more vermouth than gin.

A dirty martini contains a splash of olive brine or olive juice and is typically garnished with an olive. An extra dirty martini typically contains twice the amount of olive brine or juice.

A direct martini or naked martini is a regular martini, but prepared by storing the gin in a freezer and then pouring the gin directly into the serving glass with the vermouth instead of stirring it with ice first. This method allows the drink to be served very cold but without the dilution that the traditional stirring method adds. This style of martini is mainly associated with and popularized by Dukes Hotel Bar in London.

A martini may also be served on the rocks—that is, with the ingredients poured over ice cubes and served in an old fashioned glass.

A Gibson is a standard dry martini garnished with cocktail onions instead of olives.

The Yale Cocktail is a 6:1 martini with equal parts vermouth and either crème de violette or Creme Yvette, which impart a blue color, and Angostura bitters.

===Vodka martini===
A vodka martini is a cocktail made with vodka and vermouth, a variation of a martini. A vodka martini is made by combining vodka, dry vermouth and ice in a cocktail shaker or mixing glass. The ingredients are chilled, either by stirring or shaking, then strained and served &quot;straight up&quot; (without ice) in a chilled cocktail glass. The drink may be garnished with an olive, a &quot;twist&quot; (a strip of lemon peel squeezed or twisted), capers, or cocktail onions (with the onion garnish specifically yielding a vodka Gibson).

=== Other meanings of the word ===
A trend that started in the 1980s was to use the term &quot;martini&quot; to refer to other mostly-hard-liquor cocktails such as Manhattan, Cosmopolitan, whose commonality with the original drink is the cocktail glass in which they are served. There is some debate as to whether or not these are true martinis. In a similar vein, there are &quot;dessert martinis&quot; that are not a drink, but are served in martini glasses.

Some newer drinks include the word &quot;martini&quot; or the suffix &quot;-tini&quot; in the name (e.g., appletini, peach martini, chocolate martini, breakfast martini). These are so named because they are served in a cocktail glass. Generally containing vodka, they have little in common with the martini. A porn star martini is a variation of a vodka martini. The vodka is vanilla flavored, and is served with passion fruit juice, accompanied by a shot of Prosecco.

====Popular variations====
* Bacon martini
* Chocolate martini
* Espresso martini
* China martini, which is actually a flavour variant of Amaro
* French martini
* Mexican martini
* Saketini
* Vesper, also called a Vesper martini

====Nicotini====
A nicotini is any alcoholic drink which includes nicotine as an ingredient. Its name is modeled after the word &quot;martini&quot; in the fashion of such drinks as the appletini. It often exudes an amber color.

==In popular culture==
Martinis are often used in art to symbolise joy and closure.
*The fictional British Secret Service agent James Bond is famously known for ordering a &quot;vodka martini, shaken, not stirred&quot;.
** The phrase first appears, yet without the specification for &quot;vodka&quot;, in the fourth book of the Bond novel series by Ian Fleming in &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; (1956), but the Bond character is not the one that says it.
** A variation of the phrase is uttered by the villain Dr. Julius No, in the first Bond film, &quot;Dr. No&quot; (1962), but again, Bond is not the character who says it.
** In &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, Fleming invented the Vesper martini, with gin, vodka, and Kina Lillet.
** It was first uttered by the Bond character himself (Sean Connery), in its entirety, in the third Bond film, &quot;Goldfinger&quot; (1964).
*On the American television show &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;, Jeannie makes vodka martini gush from a rock in the desert for Captain Nelson, calling it his &quot;favorite potion&quot; (though at the time he needed water).
*The Australian writer Frank Moorhouse, (famous for creating complex female protagonists such as Edith in &quot;Dark Palace&quot;), was an uncompromising Martini enthusiast. His novels and short stories are often punctuated with extensive explanations of proper and improper ways to make a Martini. Moorhouse&#x27;s book, &quot;Martini: A Memoir&quot; (2005), considers the cocktail as a way of being and a symbol for aspects of his own life. It also includes handy instructions for mixing the perfect Martini. 
*On the American sitcom &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, the main character Benjamin &quot;Hawkeye&quot; Pierce has a gin distillery in his tent, which he uses to make martinis in almost every episode.
*In the animated television series &quot;Family Guy&quot;, the dry martini is notably associated with Brian Griffin, the family’s anthropomorphic dog. Brian is frequently depicted drinking dry martinis, which have become a defining characteristic of his personality and a recurring element in the show.

<text>In population genetics, gene flow (also known as migration and [[allele]] flow) is the transfer of genetic material from one population to another. If the rate of gene flow is high enough, then two populations will have equivalent allele frequencies and therefore can be considered a single effective population. It has been shown that it takes only &quot;one migrant per generation&quot; to prevent populations from diverging due to drift. Populations can diverge due to selection even when they are exchanging alleles, if the selection pressure is strong enough. Gene flow is an important mechanism for transferring genetic diversity among populations. Migrants change the distribution of genetic diversity among populations, by modifying allele frequencies (the proportion of members carrying a particular variant of a gene). High rates of gene flow can reduce the genetic differentiation between the two groups, increasing homogeneity. For this reason, gene flow has been thought to constrain speciation and prevent range expansion by combining the gene pools of the groups, thus preventing the development of differences in genetic variation that would have led to differentiation and adaptation. In some cases dispersal resulting in gene flow may also result in the addition of novel genetic variants under positive selection to the gene pool of a species or population (adaptive introgression.)

There are a number of factors that affect the rate of gene flow between different populations. Gene flow is expected to be lower in species that have low dispersal or mobility, that occur in fragmented habitats, where there is long distances between populations, and when there are small population sizes. Mobility plays an important role in dispersal rate, as highly mobile individuals tend to have greater movement prospects. Although animals are thought to be more mobile than plants, pollen and seeds may be carried great distances by animals, water or wind. When gene flow is impeded, there can be an increase in inbreeding, measured by the inbreeding coefficient (F) within a population. For example, many island populations have low rates of gene flow due to geographic isolation and small population sizes. The Black Footed Rock Wallaby has several inbred populations that live on various islands off the coast of Australia. The population is so strongly isolated that lack of gene flow has led to high rates of inbreeding.

== Measuring gene flow ==
The level of gene flow among populations can be estimated by observing the dispersal of individuals and recording their reproductive success. This direct method is only suitable for some types of organisms, more often indirect methods are used that infer gene flow by comparing allele frequencies among population samples. The more genetically differentiated two populations are, the lower the estimate of gene flow, because gene flow has a homogenizing effect. Isolation of populations leads to divergence due to drift, while migration reduces divergence. Gene flow can be measured by using the effective population size (formula_1) and the net migration rate per generation (m). Using the approximation based on the Island model, the effect of migration can be calculated for a population in terms of the degree of genetic differentiation(formula_2). This formula accounts for the proportion of total molecular marker variation among populations, averaged over loci. When there is one migrant per generation, the inbreeding coefficient (formula_2) equals 0.2. However, when there is less than 1 migrant per generation (no migration), the inbreeding coefficient rises rapidly resulting in fixation and complete divergence (formula_2 = 1). The most common formula_2 is &lt; 0.25. This means there is some migration happening. Measures of population structure range from 0 to 1. When gene flow occurs via migration the deleterious effects of inbreeding can be ameliorated.

formula_6

The formula can be modified to solve for the migration rate when formula_2 is known: formula_8, Nm = number of migrants.

== Barriers to gene flow ==

=== Allopatric speciation ===
When gene flow is blocked by physical barriers, this results in Allopatric speciation or a geographical isolation that does not allow populations of the same species to exchange genetic material. Physical barriers to gene flow are usually, but not always, natural. They may include impassable mountain ranges, oceans, or vast deserts. In some cases, they can be artificial, human-made barriers, such as the Great Wall of China, which has hindered the gene flow of native plant populations. One of these native plants, &quot;Ulmus pumila&quot;, demonstrated a lower prevalence of genetic differentiation than the plants &quot;Vitex negundo,&quot; &quot;Ziziphus jujuba,&quot; &quot;Heteropappus hispidus,&quot; and &quot;Prunus armeniaca&quot; whose habitat is located on the opposite side of the Great Wall of China where &quot;Ulmus pumila&quot; grows. This is because &quot;Ulmus pumila&quot; has wind-pollination as its primary means of propagation and the latter-plants carry out pollination through insects. Samples of the same species which grow on either side have been shown to have developed genetic differences, because there is little to no gene flow to provide recombination of the gene pools.

=== Sympatric speciation ===

Barriers to gene flow need not always be physical. Sympatric speciation happens when new species from the same ancestral species arise along the same range. This is often a result of a reproductive barrier. For example, two palm species of &quot;Howea&quot; found on Lord Howe Island were found to have substantially different flowering times correlated with soil preference, resulting in a reproductive barrier inhibiting gene flow. Species can live in the same environment, yet show very limited gene flow due to reproductive barriers, fragmentation, specialist pollinators, or limited hybridization or hybridization yielding unfit hybrids. A cryptic species is a species that humans cannot tell is different without the use of genetics. Moreover, gene flow between hybrid and wild populations can result in loss of genetic diversity via genetic pollution, assortative mating and outbreeding. In human populations, genetic differentiation can also result from endogamy, due to differences in caste, ethnicity, customs and religion.

== Human assisted gene-flow ==

=== Genetic rescue ===
Gene flow can also be used to assist species which are threatened with extinction. When a species exist in small populations there is an increased risk of inbreeding and greater susceptibility to loss of diversity due to drift. These populations can benefit greatly from the introduction of unrelated individuals who can increase diversity and reduce the amount of inbreeding, and potentially increase population size. This was demonstrated in the lab with two bottleneck strains of &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, in which crosses between the two populations reversed the effects of inbreeding and led to greater chances of survival in not only one generation but two.

===Genetic pollution===

Human activities such as movement of species and modification of landscape can result in genetic pollution, hybridization, introgression and genetic swamping. These processes can lead to homogenization or replacement of local genotypes as a result of either a numerical and/or fitness advantage of introduced plant or animal. Nonnative species can threaten native plants and animals with extinction by hybridization and introgression either through purposeful introduction by humans or through habitat modification, bringing previously isolated species into contact. These phenomena can be especially detrimental for rare species coming into contact with more abundant ones which can occur between island and mainland species. Interbreeding between the species can cause a &#x27;swamping&#x27; of the rarer species&#x27; gene pool, creating hybrids that supplant the native stock. This is a direct result of evolutionary forces such as natural selection, as well as genetic drift, which lead to the increasing prevalence of advantageous traits and homogenization. The extent of this phenomenon is not always apparent from outward appearance alone. While some degree of gene flow occurs in the course of normal evolution, hybridization with or without introgression may threaten a rare species&#x27; existence. For example, the Mallard is an abundant species of duck that interbreeds readily with a wide range of other ducks and poses a threat to the integrity of some species.

===Urbanization===

There are two main models for how urbanization affects gene flow of urban populations. The first is through habitat fragmentation, also called urban fragmentation, in which alterations to the landscape that disrupt or fragment the habitat decrease genetic diversity. The second is called the urban facilitation model, and suggests that in some populations, gene flow is enabled by anthropogenic changes to the landscape. Urban facilitation of gene flow connects populations, reduces isolation, and increases gene flow into an area which would otherwise not have this specific genome composition.

Urban facilitation can occur in many different ways, but most of the mechanisms include bringing previously separated species into contact, either directly or indirectly. Altering a habitat through urbanization will cause habitat fragmentation, but could also potentially disrupt barriers and create a pathway, or corridor, that can connect two formerly separated species. The effectiveness of this depends on individual species’ dispersal abilities and adaptiveness to different environments to use anthropogenic structures to travel. Human-driven climate change is another mechanism by which southern-dwelling animals might be forced northward towards cooler temperatures, where they could come into contact with other populations not previously in their range. More directly, humans are known to introduce non-native species into new environments, which could lead to hybridization of similar species.

This urban facilitation model was tested on a human health pest, the Western black widow spider (&quot;Latrodectus hesperus&quot;). A study by Miles et al. collected genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism variation data in urban and rural spider populations and found evidence for increased gene flow in urban Western black widow spiders compared to rural populations. In addition, the genome of these spiders was more similar across rural populations than it was for urban populations, suggesting increased diversity, and therefore adaptation, in the urban populations of the Western black widow spider. Phenotypically, urban spiders are larger, darker, and more aggressive, which could lead to increased survival in urban environments. These findings demonstrate support for urban facilitation, as these spiders are actually able to spread and diversify faster across urban environments than they would in a rural one. However, it is also an example of how urban facilitation, despite increasing gene flow, is not necessarily beneficial to an environment, as Western black widow spiders have highly toxic venom and therefore pose risks for human health.

Another example of urban facilitation is that of migrating bobcats (&quot;Lynx rufus&quot;) in the northern US and southern Canada. A study by Marrote et al. sequenced fourteen different microsatellite loci in bobcats across the Great Lakes region, and found that longitude affected the interaction between anthropogenic landscape alterations and bobcat population gene flow. While rising global temperatures push bobcat populations into northern territory, increased human activity also enables bobcat migration northward. The increased human activity brings increased roads and traffic, but also increases road maintenance, plowing, and snow compaction, inadvertently clearing a path for bobcats to travel by. The anthropogenic influence on bobcat migration pathways is an example of urban facilitation via opening up a corridor for gene flow. However, in the bobcat&#x27;s southern range, an increase in roads and traffic is correlated with a decrease in forest cover, which hinders bobcat population gene flow through these areas. Somewhat ironically, the movement of bobcats northward is caused by human-driven global warming, but is also enabled by increased anthropogenic activity in northern ranges that make these habitats more suitable to bobcats.

Consequences of urban facilitation vary from species to species. Positive effects of urban facilitation can occur when increased gene flow enables better adaptation and introduces beneficial alleles, and would ideally increase biodiversity. This has implications for conservation: for example, urban facilitation benefits an endangered species of tarantula and could help increase the population size. Negative effects would occur when increased gene flow is maladaptive and causes the loss of beneficial alleles. In the worst-case scenario, this would lead to genomic extinction through a hybrid swarm. It is also important to note that in the scheme of overall ecosystem health and biodiversity, urban facilitation is not necessarily beneficial, and generally applies to urban adapter pests. Examples of this include the previously mentioned Western black widow spider, and also the cane toad, which was able to use roads by which to travel and overpopulate Australia.

== Gene flow between species ==
=== Horizontal gene transfer ===
Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) refers to the transfer of genes between organisms in a manner other than traditional reproduction, either through transformation (direct uptake of genetic material by a cell from its surroundings), conjugation (transfer of genetic material between two bacterial cells in direct contact), transduction (injection of foreign DNA by a bacteriophage virus into the host cell) or GTA-mediated transduction (transfer by a virus-like element produced by a bacterium) .

Viruses can transfer genes between species. Bacteria can incorporate genes from dead bacteria, exchange genes with living bacteria, and can exchange plasmids across species boundaries.
&quot;Sequence comparisons suggest recent horizontal transfer of many genes among diverse species including across the boundaries of phylogenetic &#x27;domains&#x27;. Thus determining the phylogenetic history of a species can not be done conclusively by determining evolutionary trees for single genes.&quot;

Biologist Gogarten suggests &quot;the original metaphor of a tree no longer fits the data from recent genome research&quot;. Biologists [should] instead use the metaphor of a mosaic to describe the different histories combined in individual genomes and use the metaphor of an intertwined net to visualize the rich exchange and cooperative effects of horizontal gene transfer.

&quot;Using single genes as phylogenetic markers, it is difficult to trace organismal phylogeny in the presence of HGT. Combining the simple coalescence model of cladogenesis with rare HGT events suggest there was no single last common ancestor that contained all of the genes ancestral to those shared among the three domains of life. Each contemporary molecule has its own history and traces back to an individual molecule cenancestor. However, these molecular ancestors were likely to be present in different organisms at different times.&quot;

=== Hybridization ===
In some instances, when a species has a sister species and breeding capabilities are possible due to the removal of previous barriers or through introduction due to human intervention, species can hybridize and exchange genes and corresponding traits. This exchange is not always clear-cut, for sometimes the hybrids may look identical to the original species phenotypically but upon testing the mtDNA it is apparent that hybridization has occurred. Differential hybridization also occurs because some traits and DNA are more readily exchanged than others, and this is a result of selective pressure or the absence thereof that allows for easier transaction. In instances in which the introduced species begins to replace the native species, the native species becomes threatened and the biodiversity is reduced, thus making this phenomenon negative rather than a positive case of gene flow that augments genetic diversity. Introgression is the replacement of one species&#x27; alleles with that of the invader species. It is important to note that hybrids are sometime less &quot;fit&quot; than their parental generation, and as a result is a closely monitored genetic issue as the ultimate goal in conservation genetics is to maintain the genetic integrity of a species and preserve biodiversity.

== Examples ==
While gene flow can greatly enhance the fitness of a population, it can also have negative consequences depending on the population and the environment in which they reside. The effects of gene flow are context-dependent.

* Fragmented Population: fragmented landscapes such as the Galapagos Islands are an ideal place for adaptive radiation to occur as a result of differing geography. Darwin&#x27;s finches likely experienced allopatric speciation in some part due to differing geography, but that does not explain why we see so many different kinds of finches on the same island. This is due to adaptive radiation, or the evolution of varying traits in light of competition for resources. Gene flow moves in the direction of what resources are abundant at a given time. 
* Island Population: The marine iguana is an endemic species of the Galapagos Islands, but it evolved from a mainland ancestor of land iguana. Due to geographic isolation gene flow between the two species was limited and differing environments caused the marine iguana to evolve in order to adapt to the island environment. For instance, they are the only iguana that has evolved the ability to swim.
* Human Populations: In Europe &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; interbred with Neanderthals resulting in gene flow between these populations. This gene flow has resulted in Neanderthal alleles in modern European population. Two theories exist for the human evolution throughout the world. The first is known as the multiregional model in which modern human variation is seen as a product of radiation of &quot;Homo erectus&quot; out of Africa after which local differentiation led to the establishment of regional population as we see them now. Gene flow plays an important role in maintaining a grade of similarities and preventing speciation. In contrast the single origin theory assumes that there was a common ancestral population originating in Africa of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; which already displayed the anatomical characteristics we see today. This theory minimizes the amount of parallel evolution that is needed.
* Butterflies: Comparisons between sympatric and allopatric populations of &quot;Heliconius melpomene&quot;, &quot;H. cydno&quot;, and &quot;H. timareta&quot; revealed a genome-wide trend of increased shared variation in sympatry, indicative of pervasive interspecific gene flow. 
* Human-mediated gene flow: The captive genetic management of threatened species is the only way in which humans attempt to induce gene flow in ex situ situation. One example is the giant panda which is part of an international breeding program in which genetic materials are shared between zoological organizations in order to increase genetic diversity in the small populations. As a result of low reproductive success, artificial insemination with fresh/frozen-thawed sperm was developed which increased cub survival rate. A 2014 study found that high levels of genetic diversity and low levels of inbreeding were estimated in the breeding centers.
* Plants: Two populations of monkeyflowers were found to use different pollinators (bees and hummingbirds) that limited gene flow, resulting in genetic isolation, eventually producing two different species, &quot;Mimulus lewisii&quot; and &quot;Mimulus cardinalis&quot; .
* Sika deer: Sika deer were introduced into Western Europe, and they reproduce easily with the native red deer. This translocation of Sika deer has led to introgression and there are no longer &quot;pure&quot; red deer in the region, and all can be classified as hybrids.
* Bobwhite quail: Bobwhite quail were translocated from the southern part of the United States to Ontario in order to increase population numbers and game for hunting. The hybrids that resulted from this translocation was less fit than the native population and were not adapted to survive the Northern Winters.

<text>Spiderleg Records was an independent record label founded by UK anarcho-punk band Flux of Pink Indians in 1981.

The band set up the label after releasing their first EP on the Crass Records label, which taught them the skills necessary to run such a project and provided them with the seed cash. In turn, the band not only used the label to release their own material, but gave opportunities to like-minded punk bands to put out records, including The Subhumans, who in a similar fashion set up the Bluurg label. Others that released records on Spiderleg included The System, Amebix and Antisect.

The first record to be put out was a re-recording of older material made when the band were known as The Epileptics (they changed the name to EPI-X following complaints from the British Epilepsy Association and eventually emerged as Flux of Pink Indians having reverted to The Epileptics and then The Licks). This was an EP entitled &quot;1970s Have Been Made in Hong Kong&quot;, which had originally been released by the small Bishop&#x27;s Stortford based label Stortbeat. However, the band fell into dispute with Stortbeat when the label allegedly re-released the single without paying the band owed royalties. The re-recording is also notable for featuring Penny Rimbaud of Crass on drums as the original Epileptics drummer was not available.

The label had considerable indie chart success, with several hits on the UK Indie Chart, including a number one album with Flux of Pink Indians&#x27; &quot;Strive To Survive Causing The Least Suffering Possible&quot;, which also reached number 79 on the UK Album Chart.

Derek Birkett, bass player of Flux of Pink Indians, later set up the highly successful label One Little Indian Records, now known as One Little Independent Records, whose releases have included material by Björk, The Shamen, Skunk Anansie, Queen Adreena and Chumbawamba, amongst others.

<doc id="327063" wikidata="Q3334028" url="?curid=327063" title="Mārtiņi">
<text>Mārtiņi () or Mārtiņdiena is an ancient Latvian winter welcoming holiday, when the time of pieguļa and shepherding came to an end. According to a solar calendar, Mārtiņdiena marks the midpoint between the autumnal equinox (Miķeļi) and winter solstice (Ziemassvētki), and is celebrated in the middle of November. Mārtiņi ended Veļu laiks (Time of the Dead) and started Ledus laiks (Time of Ice), when the swamp became passable and raids of armed men sitting on horses were expected.

==Relationship with St. Martin&#x27;s cult==
The holiday has already acquired its name before the 16th century, during which happened the reformation of churches by Livonian Order&#x27;s sacred memorial day in honor of a Roman soldier Martin (&quot;Martinus&quot;), who sat on the horse, offering his cloak to a poor man suffering from coldness. Then he learned through dreams, that it was Jesus himself. Christian legend tells, that Martin did not want to become a bishop and hid away in the poultry barn, however, the local church nationals meanwhile walked around and they discovered him because of poultry&#x27;s noisiness. Therefore, the Latvian Mārtiņi beliefs and predictions are not only associated with horses and clothes, but also with poultry slaughter and Children of Mārtiņi march.

==Mārtiņi traditional legends==

===Prediction with clothes===

&quot;Maidens on Mārtiņi&#x27;s Eve have to throw a skirt in the middle of the room before going to sleep; who picks it up it in a dream will marry.&quot; &quot;On Mārtiņi&#x27;s Eve all clothes which were worn on that day, must be left on the floor; who picks them up during the night will be the right mate.&quot;

===Rooster slaughter===

In the evening, before Mārtiņi, in honor of stables they sacrificed a rooster, believing that would prevent horses from catching a disease in the winter. Pēteris Šmits&#x27;s compiled &quot;Latvian folk beliefs&quot; found in following ancient ritual descriptions:

&quot;[..]The landlord took a rooster, brought it to the horse stables, stopped in front of one horse and bypassed the rooster around the horse in circles, towards the sun, instead of along the sun. Once it was done to every horses, who were located in the stable, then the landlord killed the rooster, holding it over a bushel of oats and nearly drenching it with blood. These oats with blood were poured into a manger, from which every horses got to eat. With rooster&#x27;s bloody head and neck the stable&#x27;s jamb and lintel were smeared, and drew a cross on the floor. [..]&quot; (1832) &quot;On Mārtiņvakarā, they took a loaf of bread and went to the horse stable. There they slaughtered a rooster and with its blood tarnished the left hind leg of each horse. After that a loaf of bread with the rooster were carried around horses, then the horses would not be smitten with evil spirits and their random incubus.&quot;

===Children of Mārtiņi walking around===

On Mārtiņi mask marches helped with Mārtiņi&#x27;s healing and pedestrians with Mārtiņi&#x27;s children or mārtiņiem: &quot;On Mārtiņi Eve the youth dressed up and walked around asking for gifts, which then all together were poured.&quot; (1781) &quot;On Mārtiņi Eve the Mārtiņi children chased Mārtiņi with sticks.&quot; If Children of Mārtiņi flogged someone from home team, then do not run away under the bed, because then all his life a man will be fearful.&quot; &quot;On Mārtiņi Eve, men went through the village, dressed in clipped fur coats as someone from evil side and girded with belts of braided straw, and also stuck a tail to buttocks; they went to frighten children, in order to make them learn and listen to their parents.&quot; (1852)

==Mārtiņi traditions in Latvian dainas==

==Mārtiņdiena traditions in other countries==
Traditions of Mārtiņi Day are known by many citizens of European countries. Germans call this celebration &quot;Martinstag&quot;, Englishmen call it &quot;Martinmas&quot;, Swedish - &quot;Mårtensafton&quot;, Danes - &quot;Mortensdag&quot;, Finns - &quot;Martinpäivä&quot;, while Estonians call it &quot;Mardipäev&quot;. Since Middle Ages, this holiday is associated with the horse cult and knight traditions. In Austria, Germany and Netherlands, on Mārtiņi Eve happens a solemn children processions with candles and lanterns. The traditional festive meal on this day is a roasted goose.

<text>Martini Racing is the name under which various motor racing teams race when sponsored by the Italian company Martini &amp; Rossi, a distillery that produces Martini vermouth in Turin. Martini&#x27;s sponsorship program began in 1958 as Martini International Club, founded by Count Metello Rossi di Montelera of Martini &amp; Rossi. The race cars were marked with the distinctive dark blue, light blue and red stripes mostly on white or silver background body cars, but also red or green ones.

==Beginnings==


Martini&#x27;s first sponsorship program happened at the Daytona 3 hours in 1962 with two Alfa Romeo Giulietta SZ Coda Troncas, but they had no Martini stickers or logos on them, only &quot;Martini &amp; Rossi Racing Team&quot; written along the front quarter panels.

The two key individuals at the start of Martini Racing&#x27;s grand adventure were Paul Goppert, head of publicity and public relations for Martini Germany, and his close friend Hans-Dieter Dechent (1940-2014), a racing driver specializing in endurance racing who ran his father&#x27;s Opel dealership in Saarbrücken, Germany.

At the start of 1968, advertising unrelated to racing was permitted for the first time on the bodywork of racing cars. Paul asked Hans-Dieter to place a few stickers on his car in exchange for overalls and similar equipment.

Martini stickers then appeared, in April 1968 on the Porsche 910 raced by Scuderia Lufthansa Racing Team set up by Robert Huhn, an executive manager of the German airline.

As Dechent wanted to race the sooner with its new car, the car&#x27;s first appearance of 910-023 in its silver livery with front Lufthansa colors and Martini stickers was at Eberbach-Schwanheim hill climb, the 28 April with n° 174. Then the same car appeared at Dijon-Longvic GP on the fifth of May (Nr 10) where it made 2nd just behind the Matra-Ford 630, then at Paris GP on May 12 (Nr 26) where it renewed its 2nd place and mostly known at the 1000 km of Nürburgring on May 19 (Nr 24). Later in a minor event at the Hockenheimring on 21 July 1968 it did not finish (Nr 13).

Martini Racing was then formed to enter two Porsche 907 in several sports car races in 1969 to back up the factory effort.

== Martini Porsche ==
The Martini brand came to prominence in the 1970 World Sportscar Championship, when the team of Hans-Dieter Dechent entered as &quot;International Martini Racing Team&quot;.

the 1971 World Sportscar Championship, when Porsche moved the second factory-backed entry, along the already famous Gulf Racing-sponsored JWA team, from Porsche Salzburg to &quot;Martini International Racing&quot;. The team entered two cars in varying Martini liveries, mostly the mighty Porsche 917, but also the nimble Porsche 908/3 on twisty tracks like Targa Florio and 1000km Nürburgring. 

== The 1971 24 Hours of Le Mans ==
During the 1970s, Martini became famous in connection with Porsche in motorsport, sponsoring the works Porsche 917 that won the 1971 24 Hours of Le Mans. The Martini Porsche cars won Le Mans once more in 1976 and 1977 with Porsche 936, as well as in many other events in the 1970s for the factory Porsche team, with the RSR Turbo, 935 and 936. In 1978, Martini only sponsored the works team in Le Mans, while in 1980 they were associated with Joest Racing, once more only at Le Mans.

==Targa Florio==
 In 1973, Martini sponsored the 911 Carrera RSR that won the Targa Florio.

==Martini Lancia==
In 1981, Martini Racing supported the Italian Lancia effort in sports car racing with the Group 5 Lancia Monte Carlo, Group 6 Lancia LC1 and Group C Lancia LC2. The works Lancia Martini drivers lineup included several contemporary Formula One racers, including Michele Alboreto, Teo Fabi and Riccardo Patrese. The association lasted until the 1986 24 Hours of Le Mans, but by then, Lancia was more involved with rallying. After that, Martini Racing has made only brief entries in sports car racing, including three seasons in the FIA Sportscar Championship with Gianni Giudici&#x27;s Picchio.

==Formula One==


Martini Racing&#x27;s association with Formula One began in 1972 with the Italian team Tecno. However, disagreements between Rossi and the team owners over technical and sporting directions, resulted in an uncompetitive car and Martini withdrew its support to the program after an unsuccessful 1972 and 1973 season.

Martini returned full-time in 1975, sponsoring Bernie Ecclestone&#x27;s Brabham team. The initial colour scheme incorporated the Martini colours on a white background on the Ford-Cosworth powered Brabham BT44B in 1975. 

When the Alfa Romeo flat-V12 powered Brabham BT45 and Brabham BT45B were used for the 1976 and 1977 seasons, the main color was shifted to the traditional Italian red racing &quot;rosso corsa&quot; background. Drivers such as Carlos Reutemann, Carlos Pace, Hans-Joachim Stuck and John Watson all drove for the team during this time.

For the 1979 season, the Martini sponsorship moved to Team Lotus. In spite of having the 1978 championship winning Lotus 79 and Mario Andretti and Carlos Reutemann as drivers, the Martini Lotus association did not achieve a single win and by the end of the year, Martini withdrew from F1 once more.

After a long break from the category, the Italian company began sponsoring Scuderia Ferrari in 2006 with a minor presence.

Williams Grand Prix Engineering announced a partnership with Martini beginning with the 2014 season, and continued their sponsorship by Martini into the 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 seasons. This partnership ended after the 2018 season.

==Rallying==

Martini&#x27;s first rally challenge was taken up by usual stalwart Porsche. In 1978, Porsche made a return to the World Rally Championship as a works team, running a 911 SC for Björn Waldegård and Vic Preston Jr. in the Safari Rally. The project did not continue past this one-off entry, where Preston was 2nd and Waldegård 4th.

The second time Martini Racing sponsored a rally team was 1980, where Luigi Racing (Belgium) started with a BMW 323i E21 Group 2. Luigi Racing was before successful in the European Touring Car Championship with a BMW 3.0 Coupé CSL. Driver of the 323i have been Hermes Delbar and Timo Mäkinen.

In 1982, just as they had done one year previously with sports cars, Martini Racing signed with the works Lancia team, sponsoring the brand new Group B Lancia 037, with Attilio Bettega and Markku Alen as drivers. The Lancia Martini partnership in the World Rally Championship was one of the company&#x27;s longest, remaining until the end of the 1992 season, with several cars, including the Group B Delta S4 and Group A Delta Integrale winning events and titles with drivers such as Juha Kankkunen, Bruno Saby, Massimo Biasion and Didier Auriol. The Martini Lancia cars won the WRC Drivers&#x27; title in 1987 and 1991 with Kankkunen, and 1988 and 1989 with Biasion, as well as the Constructors&#x27; title with the 037 in 1983, and consecutively with the Group A Delta from 1987 to 1992.

In the following years, Martini returned with a smaller sponsorship program, restricted to the Italian Rally Championship, which the Martini Racing driver, Gianfranco Cunico, won from 1994 to 1996 with a Jolly Club Ford Escort Cosworth.

Martini returned to the WRC full-time for the 1999 season onwards with Ford Motor Company&#x27;s M-Sport-run World Rally Team. With drivers such as Carlos Sainz, Colin McRae and Markko Märtin, the Martini-liveried Fords won several rallies, but never the title. This arrangement ceased at the end of 2002.

The car model which has won the most titles for Martini Racing is the Lancia Delta HF Integrale.

==Touring car racing==

It wouldn&#x27;t be until 1992 that Martini Racing would be seriously involved with touring car racing. The Italian company sponsored the works Alfa Romeo 155 in the Italian Touring Car Championship, which the team dominated, with Nicola Larini taking the championship title.

This served as an appetizer to a bigger prize, most specifically the DTM, the German-based touring car series. Although the Martini Alfa Romeo connection only materialized in 1995 and by then the Alfas (driven by Larini and Alessandro Nannini, both ex-F1 drivers) weren&#x27;t as competitive.

==Powerboats==
Between 1973 and 1975, Martini Racing sponsored Carlo Bonomi and Cesare Fiorio&#x27;s &quot;Dry Martini&quot; boats in the Powerboat World Championship, winning back-to-back titles in 1973 and 1974. At the time, the Martini boat hit an average top speed of 66.9 mph. 
Martini returned to offshore racing in 1978 sponsoring Guido Niccolai&#x27;s boats, who took the European titles in 1979 and 1981. The 35 foot Cigarette that was commissioned by Carlo Bonomi is currently owned and raced by Jonathan Sainsbury, a furniture designer from Dorset.

In 1982 Martini Racing entered the Formula 1 Powerboat World Championship supporting the defending champion Renato Molinari: he missed the title by a single point, but won the following two seasons.

In 1987 Martini was back again in offshore racing with a Molinari-designed powerboat equipped with Lancia-Ferrari engines. After two seasons with poor results, Molinari switched to a new catamaran design powered by Lamborghini engines. At the end of 1989 both Molinari and Martini retired from powerboat racing.

In 2014, the Vector-Martini team of Peter Dredge, Simon Powell and Mal Crease crossed the finish line at the Cowes Offshore Classic more than four nautical miles ahead of their nearest rival. The following year, the same team of Dredge, Powell and Crease (with new member David Gandy) won the race more than 19 minutes ahead of the second place team.

<doc id="327068" wikidata="Q1437791" url="?curid=327068" title="Topiary">
<text>Topiary is the horticultural practice of training perennial plants by clipping the foliage and twigs of trees, shrubs and subshrubs to develop and maintain clearly defined shapes, whether geometric or fanciful. The term also refers to plants which have been shaped in this way. As an art form it is a type of living sculpture. The word derives from the Latin word for an ornamental landscape gardener, &quot;topiarius&quot;, a creator of &quot;topia&quot; or &quot;places&quot;, a Greek word that Romans also applied to fictive indoor landscapes executed in fresco.

The plants used in topiary are evergreen, mostly woody, have small leaves or needles, produce dense foliage, and have compact and/or columnar (e.g., fastigiate) growth habits. Common species chosen for topiary include cultivars of European box (&quot;Buxus sempervirens&quot;), arborvitae (&quot;Thuja&quot; species), bay laurel (&quot;Laurus nobilis&quot;), holly (&quot;Ilex&quot; species), myrtle (&quot;Eugenia&quot; or &quot;Myrtus&quot; species), yew (&quot;Taxus&quot; species), and privet (&quot;Ligustrum&quot; species). Shaped wire cages are sometimes employed in modern topiary to guide untutored shears, but traditional topiary depends on patience and a steady hand; small-leaved ivy can be used to cover a cage and give the look of topiary in a few months. The hedge is a simple form of topiary used to create boundaries, walls or screens.

==History==
===Origin===

European topiary dates from Roman times. Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot; and the epigram writer Martial both credit Gaius Matius Calvinus, in the circle of Julius Caesar, with introducing the first topiary to Roman gardens, and Pliny the Younger describes in a letter the elaborate figures of animals, inscriptions, cyphers and obelisks in clipped greens at his Tuscan villa (Epistle v.6, to Apollinaris). Within the atrium of a Roman house or villa, a place that had formerly been quite plain, the art of the &quot;topiarius&quot; produced a miniature landscape (&quot;topos&quot;) which might employ the art of stunting trees, also mentioned, disapprovingly, by Pliny (&quot;Historia Naturalis&quot; xii.6).

===Far Eastern topiary===

The clipping and shaping of shrubs and trees in China and Japan have been practised with equal rigor, but for different reasons. The goal is to achieve an artful expression of the &quot;natural&quot; form of venerably aged pines, given character by the forces of wind and weather. Their most concentrated expressions are in the related arts of Chinese penjing and Japanese bonsai.

Japanese cloud-pruning is closest to the European art: the cloud-like forms of clipped growth are designed to be best appreciated after a fall of snow. Japanese Zen gardens (&quot;karesansui&quot;, dry rock gardens) make extensive use of &quot;Karikomi&quot; (a topiary technique of clipping shrubs and trees into large curved shapes or sculptures) and &quot;Hako-zukuri&quot; (shrubs clipped into boxes and straight lines).

===Renaissance topiary===
Since its European revival in the 16th century, topiary has been seen on the parterres and terraces of gardens of the European elite, as well as in simple cottage gardens; Barnabe Googe, about 1578, found that &quot;women&quot; (a signifier of a less than gentle class) were clipping rosemary &quot;as in the fashion of a cart, a peacock, or such things as they fancy.&quot; In 1618 William Lawson suggested
:Your gardener can frame your lesser wood to the shape of men armed in the field, ready to give battell: or swift-running Grey Houndes to chase the Deere, or hunt the Hare. This kind of hunting shall not wate your corne, nor much your coyne.
Traditional topiary forms use foliage pruned and/or trained into geometric shapes such as balls or cubes, obelisks, pyramids, cones, or tiered plates and tapering spirals. Representational forms depicting people, animals, and man-made objects have also been popular. The royal botanist John Parkinson found privet &quot;so apt that no other can be like unto it, to be cut, lead, and drawn into what forme one will, either of beasts, birds, or men armed or otherwise.&quot; Evergreens have usually been the first choice for Early Modern topiary, however, with yew and boxwood leading other plants.

Topiary at Versailles and its imitators was never complicated: low hedges punctuated by potted trees trimmed as balls on standards, interrupted by obelisks at corners, provided the vertical features of flat-patterned parterre gardens. Sculptural forms were provided by stone and lead sculptures. In Holland, however, the fashion was established for more complicated topiary designs; this Franco-Dutch garden style spread to England after 1660, but by 1708-09 one searches in vain for fanciful topiary among the clipped hedges and edgings, and the standing cones and obelisks of the aristocratic and gentry English parterre gardens in Kip and Knyff&#x27;s &quot;Britannia Illustrata&quot;.

===Decline in the 18th century===

In England topiary was all but killed as a fashion by the famous satiric essay on &quot;Verdant Sculpture&quot; that Alexander Pope published in the short-lived newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot;, 29 September 1713, with its mock catalogue descriptions of
:*Adam and Eve in yew; Adam a little shattered by the fall of the tree of knowledge in the great storm; Eve and the serpent very flourishing.
:*The tower of Babel, not yet finished.
:*St George in box; his arm scarce long enough, but will be in condition to stick the dragon by next April.
:*A quickset hog, shot up into a porcupine, by its being forgot a week in rainy weather.

In the 1720s and 1730s, the generation of Charles Bridgeman and William Kent swept the English garden clean of its hedges, mazes, and topiary. Although topiary fell from grace in aristocratic gardens, it continued to be featured in cottagers&#x27; gardens, where a single example of traditional forms, a ball, a tree trimmed to a cone in several cleanly separated tiers, meticulously clipped and perhaps topped with a topiary peacock, might be passed on as an heirloom. Such an heirloom, but on heroic scale, was the ancient churchward yew of Harlington, west of London, immortalized in an engraved broadsheet of 1729 bearing an illustration with an enthusiastic verse encomium by its dedicated parish clerk and topiarist. formerly shaped as an obelisk on square plinth topped with a ten-foot ball surmounted by a cockerel, the Harlington Yew survives today, untonsured for the last two centuries.

==Revival==

The revival of topiary in English gardening parallels the revived &quot;Jacobethan&quot; taste in architecture; John Loudon in the 1840s was the first garden writer to express a sense of loss due to the topiary that had been removed from English gardens. The art of topiary, with enclosed garden &quot;rooms&quot;, burst upon the English gardening public with the mature examples at Elvaston Castle, Derbyshire, which opened to public viewing in the 1850s and created a sensation: &quot;within a few years architectural topiary was springing up all over the country (it took another 25 years before sculptural topiary began to become popular as well)&quot;. The following generation, represented by James Shirley Hibberd, rediscovered the charm of topiary specimens as part of the mystique of the &quot;English cottage garden&quot;, which was as much invented as revived from the 1870s:
The classic statement of the British Arts and Crafts revival of topiary among roses and mixed herbaceous borders, characterised generally as &quot;the old-fashioned garden&quot; or the &quot;Dutch garden&quot; was to be found in &quot;Topiary: Garden Craftsmanship in Yew and Box&quot; by Nathaniel Lloyd (1867–1933), who had retired in middle age and taken up architectural design with the encouragement of Sir Edwin Lutyens. Lloyd&#x27;s own timber-framed manor house, Great Dixter, Sussex, remains an epitome of this stylised mix of topiary with &quot;cottagey&quot; plantings that was practised by Gertrude Jekyll and Edwin Lutyens in a fruitful partnership. The new gardening vocabulary incorporating topiary required little expensive restructuring: &quot;At Lyme Park, Cheshire, the garden went from being an Italian garden to being a Dutch garden without any change actually taking place on the ground,&quot; Brent Elliot noted in 2000.

Americans in England were sensitive to the renewed charms of topiary. When William Waldorf Astor bought Hever Castle, Kent, around 1906, the moat surrounding the house precluded the addition of wings for servants, guests and the servants of guests that the Astor manner required. He accordingly built an authentically styled Tudor village to accommodate the overflow, with an &quot;Old English Garden&quot; including buttressed hedges and free-standing topiary. In the preceding decade, expatriate Americans led by Edwin Austin Abbey created an Anglo-American society at Broadway, Worcestershire, where topiary was one of the elements of a &quot;Cotswold&quot; house-and-garden style soon naturalised among upper-class Americans at home. Topiary, which had featured in very few 18th-century American gardens, came into favour with the Colonial Revival gardens and the grand manner of the American Renaissance, 1880–1920. Interest in the revival and maintenance of historic gardens in the 20th century led to the replanting of the topiary maze at the Governor&#x27;s Palace, Colonial Williamsburg, in the 1930s.

==20th century==
American portable style topiary was introduced to Disneyland around 1962. Walt Disney helped bring this new medium into being - wishing to recreate his cartoon characters throughout his theme park in the form of landscape shrubbery. This style of topiary is based on a suitably shaped steel wire frame through which the plants eventually extend as they grow. The frame, which remains as a permanent trimming guide, may be either stuffed with sphagnum moss and then planted, or placed around shrubbery. The sculpture slowly transforms into a permanent topiary as the plants fill in the frame.
This style has led to imaginative displays and festivals throughout the Disney resorts and parks, and mosaiculture (multiple types and styles of plants creating a mosaic, living sculpture) worldwide includes the impressive display at the 2008 Summer Olympics in China. Living corporate logos along roadsides, green roof softscapes and living walls that biofilter air are offshoots of this technology.

Artificial topiary is another offshoot similar to the concept of artificial Christmas trees. This topiary mimics the style of living versions and is often used to supply indoor greenery for home or office decoration. Patents are issued for the style, design, and construction methodology of different types of topiary trees.

<text>Pacer was the operational name of the British Rail Classes 140, 141, 142, 143 and 144 diesel multiple unit railbuses built between 1980 and 1987. They were inexpensively developed using a passenger body based on the Leyland National bus on top of a chassis based on the HSFV1 research vehicle. The railbuses were intended as a short-term solution to a shortage of rolling stock, with a lifespan of no more than twenty years. As modernised replacements were lacking, the Pacer fleet remained in service on some lines until 2021, 37 years after their 1984 introduction.

All Pacer trains were scheduled to be retired by the end of 2019, as the PRM-TSI requires that all public passenger trains must be accessible to disabled people by 2020; however, the Pacer units were given dispensation until the end of 2020. Only one Pacer (the modernised 144e) met this requirement, and the remainder were, therefore, planned to be withdrawn by that date. Furthermore, a decision in 2015 by the Transport Secretary required that such railbuses be removed from service by 2020 for the then-new Northern franchise, stating that the &quot;continued use of these uncomfortable and low-quality vehicles is not compatible with our vision for economic growth and prosperity in the north&quot;.

At the start of 2020, 138 Pacer units of classes 142, 143 and 144 were either still in service or storage with three National Rail operators: Arriva Rail North, Great Western Railway and KeolisAmey Wales. After the 144s were withdrawn from the Northern franchise, Northern Trains retired its last Pacer unit, a 142, on 27 November 2020, with Great Western Railway retiring its last 143 the following month. KeolisAmey Wales withdrew only its 142s in late 2020, passing its 143s to Transport for Wales Rail, who phased them out in May/June 2021.

==Features==
The Pacer series were built with low construction and running costs in mind, and so all of the Pacer units use:
* A lightweight modified bus body and other bus components, such as seating, with a reinforced driver&#x27;s cab area to comply with crashworthiness standards.
* A long-wheelbase four-wheel freight-wagon-inspired underframe, rather than the conventional arrangement of two four-wheeled bogies. This arrangement has been criticised for rough-riding, and causing loud noise and excessive wear to the wheels and track on tight curves.

==Background==
By the beginning of the 1980s, British Rail (BR) operated a large fleet of first generation diesel multiple units (DMUs), such as the Class 101, which had been constructed in the 1950s and 1960s to various designs. While formulating its long-term strategy for this sector of its operations, British Rail planners recognised that there would be considerable costs incurred by undertaking refurbishment programmes necessary for the continued use of these ageing multiple units, particularly due to the necessity of handling and removing hazardous materials such as asbestos. In light of the high costs involved in retention, planners examined the prospects for the development and introduction of a new generation of DMUs to succeed the first generation.
During the early 1980s, BR developed two separate approaches towards developing a second generation of DMUs. The first involved the development of substantial DMUs which could deliver performance superior to the existing fleet, especially on long-distance services. This ultimately lead to the development of the Class 150 and Class 151 prototypes, and the wider Sprinter family of DMUs. Financial restraints led to the development of the second approach involving the so-called &quot;railbus&quot; that prioritised the minimisation of both initial (procurement) and ongoing (maintenance and operational) costs; BR officials recognised that a cheaper unit was desirable for service on the smaller branch lines that would not be unduly impacted by lower performance specifications or a high-density configuration. As such, work to progress both approaches was undertaken by BR&#x27;s research department.

During this period, a number of prototypes were constructed to explore different designs and approaches for implementing the railbus concept. The initial prototype, known as Leyland Experimental Vehicle (LEV) 1, was a joint project by the British Rail Research Division and Leyland Motors and used a Leyland National bus body mounted on modified freight vehicle underframe (High Speed Freight Vehicle (HSFV) 1). A subsequent test vehicle, a single two-car unit, designated as the Class 140, was constructed between 1979 and 1981. The principal difference between the Class 140 and the preceding R3 concept was the incorporation of the underframe structure into the body above, thus making the latter a load-bearing structure. Other changes included the strengthening of the cant rail area and the use of standard BR multiple unit ends, enabling compliance with full Union Internationale des Chemins de fer (UIC) end load specifications for multiple units. Internally, a mixture of standard railway multiple unit seating and bus seating was installed. The resulting railbus was relatively lightweight, as had been desired by BR&#x27;s concept.

The Pacers had originally been intended as a low-cost stopgap solution to the rolling stock shortage, with a maximum lifespan of twenty years. A total of 165 Pacer trains (totalling 340 carriages) were built for BR. By 2015, the majority of these remained in operation with various private train operating companies, despite the type being in excess of thirty years old. Outside of the UK, Pacer demonstrator units toured various nations, including the U.S., Northern Ireland, Belgium, Sweden, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, without producing significant sales. Iran purchased redundant Class 141 units, for use on suburban lines around Tehran until 2005.

==Class 140==
The Pacer series was the result of an experiment to assess the viability of using bus parts to create a diesel multiple unit. The two-car Class 140 was a prototype vehicle that was built in 1980 at British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL)&#x27;s Derby Litchurch Lane Works. This prototype was introduced with much fanfare during June 1981. During its trial period, the Class 140 toured various lines across the UK. It later functioned as a demonstration unit for the incoming fleet based on the type, the Class 141. By 1985, the unit was in use as a driver training vehicle. From September 1986, the sole Class 140 was allocated to Neville Hill.

Initial testing with the Class 140 uncovered several issues, such as difficulty detecting the type via track circuits, this was reliably resolved by swapping the material of the brake blocks from a composite to iron. Two less easily addressable drawbacks were the high level of noise generated during transit, particularly on older jointed rails, which was a consequence of the railbus&#x27;s direct connection between the underframe and suspension with the body that transmitted impact forces across the body. It was also observed that the inclusion of strengthening members in the mass-produced bus body added significantly to the overall production cost, which eliminated much of the cost advantage that was the primarily goal of the type. The original traction power train of the Class 140 consisted of a Leyland TL11 200 HP engine, a Self-Changing Gears mechanical automatic gearbox and a Gmeinder final drive unit on each car driving only a single axle. This propulsion arrangement was in part taken from the Leyland National bus. The controller for the automatic transmission was observed by BR engineers to the cause of numerous operating failures and other reliability issues; this was allegedly due to defective relay logic and poor earthing.

==Class 141==
The Class 140 was viewed to be an overall success, and thus BR issued an order for an initial production model, designated Class 141, to British Leyland during 1984 with production commencing thereafter. During its early years of service, the Class 141 experienced numerous issues, particularly with the transmission and ride quality; work undertaken at BR&#x27;s direction resulted in the quick development of numerous improvements to at least partially address these shortcomings. When it came to ordering more railbuses, however, it was decided that instead of placing these follow-on orders for further Class 141, it would be more desirable to procure improved derivatives of the Class 141. Accordingly, BR placed orders for two new models of the Pacer family with separate manufacturers, these being the Class 142 and Class 143 respectively.

The prototype was joined by another 20 two-car units which formed the Class 141 fleet. The units were used mainly in Yorkshire, operating on predominantly suburban services. They had a capacity of 94 passengers per two-car set, and two Leyland TL11 engines gave a total of , resulting in a top speed of . The Class 141s were built with standard Leyland National bodies, whose comparatively narrow width meant they could only be fitted with standard bus seating. The later Pacers had widened body panels to allow increased seating. Furthermore, in order to maximise cost savings, the manufacturers made use of road bus-standard electrical equipment, passenger fittings, and general cab layout wherever possible.

During 1988, in response to reliability problems related to the electronics used, the entire class was briefly withdrawn and underwent a technical upgrade at the Hunslet-Barclay works in Kilmarnock. The reliability issue was largely resolved via the replacement of the original relay-based controller of the transmission with an alternative that was microprocessor-based. The units were permanently withdrawn from British Rail service in 1997. Many Class 141s were sold to Islamic Republic of Iran Railways.

==Class 142==
The next and largest Pacer class was the Class 142. As BR was considering ordering more railbuses, it was decided that, instead of placing these follow-on orders for further Class 141 vehicles, it would be more desirable to procure improved derivatives of the Class 141. Accordingly, BR placed orders for two new models of the Pacer family with separate manufacturers, these being the Class 142 and Class 143 respectively.

The Class 142 again was built by Leyland and BREL, in 1985. The body was based on a Leyland National bus, built at Workington in Cumbria. Many fixtures and fittings of the Leyland National could be found on the units. The new class had a greater capacity of 120 passengers per two-car set and the same engines were used. The first sets were used initially on Devon and Cornwall branch lines and on commuter services in the north west. The units from Cornwall were eventually moved to Liverpool and the north east, and the Class 142s became a common sight on services across the north of England. 

The Class 142s received substantial upgrades during the early 1990s, which included the installation of more powerful Cummins engines, which gave a total power output of per two-car set. A number of units were then modified for use on the Merseyside PTE City Line on Merseyrail in the Liverpool region, which included dot-matrix route indicators, improved seating and Merseyrail PTE paintwork. 

The Class 142s moved into the control of Arriva Trains Northern and First North Western at privatisation, and subsequently passed on to Northern Rail, Arriva Rail North, Northern Trains, Arriva Trains Wales, KeolisAmey Wales and Transport for Wales Rail. Eight Northern Rail units were temporarily withdrawn from service, replaced by a cascading of British Rail Class 158s. First Great Western received 12 units on loan from Northern Rail from December 2007 to November 2011 (five units were returned to Northern Rail in December 2008) to cover for refurbishment of its fleet and to allow most of its Class 158 fleet to be rebuilt as three-car sets.

==Class 143 and Class 144==
Around the same time of the Class 142 development, a Pacer railbus was being developed by Kilmarnock based Hunslet-Barclay. The units used a Walter Alexander bus body. The units were given the number Class 143 and entered service in 1985. Again with two 205 bhp engines giving a total output of and a top speed of , the class originally had a capacity of 122 passengers. The class was used in the North East before being transferred to Wales and the South West, and were moved over to Valley Lines and Wales &amp; West control during privatisation. They then passed on to Arriva Trains Wales, Wessex Trains, First Great Western and Transport for Wales. The interiors were completely changed in 2000, when the Valley Lines service was introduced, with full back, coach-type seating installed throughout, along with improved fittings. This reduced seating capacity to 106 seats per set.

It was followed by the similar Class 144, comprising a Walter Alexander body on BREL underframe, which was introduced in 1987. The most substantial design change was the replacement of the Leyland-built engine with a more powerful Cummins LTA10-R counterpart, as well as the original mechanical transmission being replaced by a Voith hydraulic unit. A Class 144 unit was formed of either a two-car set with 122 seats or a three-car set with a total capacity of 195 passengers and , though still limited to . The units were used in the North East, passing to Northern Spirit at privatisation, then to Arriva Trains Northern, Northern Rail, Arriva Rail North and Northern Trains.

==Analysis==

The Pacers have often been criticised as being of poor quality. Instead of the usual bogies, Pacers use a basic four-wheel two-axle configuration which often results in a ride which is noisier and less comfortable than other trains. The lack of articulation can result in a rough ride, especially over points, and a loud squealing noise around tight curves. The lack of bogies also results in a more basic suspension, which can result in a bumpier ride; this has given rise to the nickname &quot;nodding donkeys&quot; owing to the trains&#x27; up-and-down motion on uneven track. The basic bench seating can also be uncomfortable. The early units, especially the s, were also especially unreliable.

The fact that Pacers have only been used in certain areas of the north and south-west of England, and the south of Wales, but not London or the south-east of England, has also created resentment.

Concerns were raised about safety after the 1999 Winsford crash, which involved a First North Western Class 142 Pacer running as empty stock, which was involved in a collision with a Virgin Trains Class 87 express after the Pacer unit had fouled the main line at Winsford, Cheshire on the West Coast Main Line. The body of the Pacer was severed from its frame, to which it was attached by wire straps, causing severe internal damage; the unit was written off. Twenty-seven passengers and crew were injured, four seriously. However, all passenger injuries were on the other train, as the Class 142 was running empty at the time.

Arguments have been made that Pacers were the saviour of some branch lines, with their low costs and relatively good fuel economy of making them a pragmatic solution at a time when budgets were tight. This has however been disputed, with the reasoning that since rolling stock costs make up a low proportion of the total cost of running a service, the lines would have remained open even without Pacers. Furthermore, given the modifications or upgrades made to the units&#x27; engines, doors, fire protection, gearboxes and brakes in the first decade of their service, the total build cost of the units in some cases exceeded those of an equivalent Sprinter unit.

==Replacements==
, the oldest Pacers on the national network were approaching 35 years old. All were planned to be withdrawn and scrapped by December 2019 as they do not comply with Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations. The first wave of class 142 withdrawal began in November 2020 by Northern, and a month later by Transport for Wales. Class 143 and 144 units also saw massive withdrawals in the late months of that year, the first 143 and 144 units being withdrawn in December 2020 by Great Western Railway and Northern. Transport for Wales were granted an extension of Pacer usage until May 2021.

=== CAF Civity ===
In July 2019, rollout of Northern&#x27;s Class 195 CAF &quot;Civity&quot; units had begun on certain routes, which allowed refurbished Sprinters no longer needed on those routes to be used to replace Pacers instead.

=== Vivarail D-Train ===

These units are built out of upcycled London Underground D78 Stock, constructed between 1978 and 1981, which were in service on the District line until 2017. Conversion of the old stock to mainline railway use will involve re-using the aluminium bodyshells, traction motors and bogies from the D78 units and fitting them out with new diesel engines and interiors. The D-Train units underwent acceptance testing in 2015 and Vivarail pitched them to train operating companies (TOCs), especially those bidding for the Northern franchise. While no orders were received from Northern, Transport for Wales will replace its Pacers with a combination of five D-Trains and rolling stock cascaded from other train operators, and other TOCs have ordered D-trains to replace other outdated rolling stock: South Western Railway for the Isle of Wight&#x27;s Island Line, and West Midlands Trains for the Marston Vale line.

=== Class 144e Evolution ===

The Class 144e (Evolution) was a proposed refurbished variant of the Class 144 which would bring it up to the requirements of the Persons with reduced mobility-Technical Specifications for Interoperability accessibility regulations. The demonstrator Class 144e unit (144012) featured a number of upgrades such as the addition of new 2+2 style seating, a fully accessible toilet, two wheelchair spaces and spaces for bicycles and luggage, as well as Wi-Fi and media screens. Porterbrook, which owns the Class 143 and Class 144 fleets, refurbished unit 144012 in 2014 to comply with the new legislation so that it could act as a demonstration unit. The demonstrator unit was expected to re-enter traffic in April 2015, but this was delayed until later in the year.

==Preservation==
Over the course of the series&#x27; withdrawal, several Pacers have been preserved for further use on heritage railways. The National Railway Museum has preserved a train with the designation number 142001.

In May 2019, the government called for a public consultation on re-using the trains after withdrawal from service; suggestions have included re-using them as public spaces, such as village halls or cafes.

<text>Ian Russell McEwan (born 21 June 1948) is a British novelist and screenwriter. In 2008, &quot;The Times&quot; featured him on its list of &quot;The 50 greatest British writers since 1945&quot; and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; ranked him number 19 in its list of the &quot;100 most powerful people in British culture&quot;.

McEwan began his career writing sparse, Gothic short stories. His first two novels, &quot;The Cement Garden&quot; (1978) and &quot;The Comfort of Strangers&quot; (1981), earned him the nickname &quot;Ian Macabre&quot;. These were followed by three novels of some success in the 1980s and early 1990s. His novel &quot;Enduring Love&quot; was adapted into a film of the same name. He won the Booker Prize with &quot;Amsterdam&quot; (1998). His next novel, &quot;Atonement&quot;, garnered acclaim and was adapted into an Oscar-winning film featuring Keira Knightley and James McAvoy. His later novels have included &quot;The Children Act&quot;, &quot;Nutshell&quot;, and &quot;Machines Like Me&quot;. He was awarded the 1999 Shakespeare Prize, and the 2011 Jerusalem Prize.

==Early life and education ==
McEwan was born in Aldershot, Hampshire, on 21 June 1948, the son of David McEwan and Rose Lilian Violet (&quot;née&quot; Moore). His father was a working-class Scotsman who had worked his way up through the army to the rank of major.

McEwan spent much of his childhood in East Asia (including Singapore), Germany, and North Africa (including Libya), where his father was posted. His family returned to England when he was 12 years old. He was educated at Woolverstone Hall School in Suffolk; the University of Sussex, where he received a degree in English literature in 1970; and the University of East Anglia, where he undertook a master&#x27;s degree in literature (with the option to submit creative writing instead of a critical dissertation).

==Career==

=== 1975–1987: Short stories and &quot;Ian Macabre&quot; phase ===
McEwan&#x27;s first published work was a collection of short stories, &quot;First Love, Last Rites&quot; (1975), which won the Somerset Maugham Award in 1976. He achieved notoriety in 1979 when the BBC suspended production of his play &quot;Solid Geometry&quot; because of its supposed obscenity. His second collection of short stories, &quot;In Between the Sheets&quot;, was published in 1978. &quot;The Cement Garden&quot; (1978) and &quot;The Comfort of Strangers&quot; (1981), his two earliest novels, were both adapted into films. The nature of these works caused him to be nicknamed &quot;Ian Macabre&quot;. These were followed by his first book for children, &quot;Rose Blanche&quot; (1985), and a return to literary fiction with &quot;The Child in Time&quot; (1987), winner of the 1987 Whitbread Novel Award.

=== 1988–2007: Mainstream success and Booker Prize win ===
After &quot;The Child in Time&quot;, McEwan began to move away from the darker, more unsettling material of his earlier career and towards the style that would see him reach a wider readership and gain significant critical acclaim. This new phase began with the publication of the mid-Cold War espionage drama &quot;The Innocent&quot; (1990), and &quot;Black Dogs&quot; (1992), a quasi-companion piece reflecting on the aftermath of the Nazi era in Europe and the end of the Cold War. McEwan followed these works with his second book for children, &quot;The Daydreamer&quot; (1994).

His 1997 novel, &quot;Enduring Love&quot;, about the relationship between a science writer and a stalker, was popular with critics, although it was not shortlisted for the Booker Prize. It was adapted into a film in 2004. In 1998, he won the Booker Prize for &quot;Amsterdam&quot;. His next novel, &quot;Atonement&quot; (2001), received considerable acclaim; &quot;Time&quot; magazine named it the best novel of 2002, and it was shortlisted for the Booker Prize. In 2007, the critically acclaimed film &quot;Atonement&quot;, directed by Joe Wright and starring Keira Knightley and James McAvoy, was released in cinemas worldwide. His next work, &quot;Saturday&quot; (2005), follows an especially eventful day in the life of a successful neurosurgeon. &quot;Saturday&quot; won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for 2005. His novel &quot;On Chesil Beach&quot; (2007) was shortlisted for the 2007 Man Booker Prize and was adapted into a film starring Saoirse Ronan in 2017, for which McEwan wrote the screenplay. McEwan has also written a number of produced screenplays, a stage play, children&#x27;s fiction, and an oratorio and a libretto titled &quot;For You&quot; with music composed by Michael Berkeley.

In 2006, McEwan was accused of plagiarism; specifically that a passage in &quot;Atonement&quot; (2001) closely echoed a passage from a memoir, &quot;No Time for Romance&quot;, published in 1977 by Lucilla Andrews. McEwan acknowledged using the book as a source for his work. McEwan had included a brief note at the end of &quot;Atonement&quot;, referring to Andrews&#x27;s autobiography, among several other works. The incident recalled critical controversy over his debut novel &quot;The Cement Garden&quot;, key elements of the plot of which closely mirrored some of those of &quot;Our Mother&#x27;s House&quot;, a 1963 novel by British author Julian Gloag, which had also been made into a film. McEwan denied charges of plagiarism, claiming he was unaware of the earlier work. Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in November 2006, a month after Andrews&#x27; death, McEwan professed innocence of plagiarism while acknowledging his debt to the author of &quot;No Time for Romance&quot;. Several authors defended him, including John Updike, Martin Amis, Margaret Atwood, Thomas Keneally, Kazuo Ishiguro, Zadie Smith, and Thomas Pynchon.

=== 2008–present: Political works and continued acclaim ===
McEwan&#x27;s first novel of the 2010s, &quot;Solar&quot;, was published by Jonathan Cape and Doubleday in March 2010. In June 2008 at the Hay Festival, McEwan gave a surprise reading of this work-in-progress. The novel includes &quot;a scientist who hopes to save the planet&quot; from the threat of climate change, with inspiration for the novel coming from a Cape Farewell expedition McEwan made in 2005 in which &quot;artists and scientists ... spent several weeks aboard a ship near the north pole discussing environmental concerns&quot;. McEwan observed: &quot;The novel&#x27;s protagonist Michael Beard has been awarded a Nobel prize for his pioneering work on physics, and has discovered that winning the coveted prize has interfered with his work.&quot; He said that the work was not a comedy: &quot;I hate comic novels; it&#x27;s like being wrestled to the ground and being tickled, being forced to laugh&quot;, instead, that it had extended comic stretches.

&quot;Solar&quot; was followed by McEwan&#x27;s twelfth novel, &quot;Sweet Tooth&quot;, a meta-fictional historical novel set in the 1970s, and was published in late August 2012. In an interview with &quot;The Scotsman&quot; newspaper to coincide with publication, McEwan revealed that the impetus for writing &quot;Sweet Tooth&quot; had been &quot;a way in which I can write a disguised autobiography&quot;. He revealed in an interview with &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, in November 2012, that the film rights to &quot;Sweet Tooth&quot; had been bought by Working Title Films – the company that had adapted &quot;Atonement&quot; as a film. &quot;Sweet Tooth&quot; was followed two years later by &quot;The Children Act&quot;, which concerned High Court judges, UK family law, and the right to die.

Two years after &quot;The Children Act&quot;, McEwan&#x27;s 2016 novel &quot;Nutshell&quot;, a short novel closer in style and tone to his earlier works, was published. McEwan&#x27;s next work, a short novella, was titled &quot;My Purple Scented Novel&quot; – part of which was published previously as a short story by the same title in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 2016. This short work was published to mark McEwan&#x27;s 70th birthday in June 2018. McEwan followed &quot;Nutshell&quot; in April 2019 with the alternate history/science fiction novel &quot;Machines Like Me&quot;. It concerns artificial intelligence and an alternate history in which Great Britain loses the Falklands War and the Labour Party, led by Tony Benn, eventually wins the 1987 UK general election. In September 2019, McEwan announced a quick surprise follow-up novella inspired by Brexit, &quot;The Cockroach&quot;. McEwan published his novel &quot;Lessons&quot; in 2022 to much critical acclaim. Andrew Billen of &quot;The Times&quot; calls it McEwan&#x27;s &quot;500-page masterpiece&quot;, and &quot;The New Statesman&quot; claims the novel &quot;may well be remembered as one of the finest humanist novels of its age&quot;.

==Honours and awards==
McEwan has been nominated for the Booker Prize six times to date, winning the prize for &quot;Amsterdam&quot; in 1998. His other nominations were for &quot;The Comfort of Strangers&quot; (1981, shortlisted), &quot;Black Dogs&quot; (1992, shortlisted), &quot;Atonement&quot; (2001, shortlisted), &quot;Saturday&quot; (2005, longlisted), and &quot;On Chesil Beach&quot; (2007, shortlisted). McEwan also received nominations for the International Booker Prize in 2005 and 2007. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature (FRSL), a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (FRSA), a Fellow of the Society of Authors, and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was awarded the annual Shakespeare Prize by the Alfred Toepfer Foundation, Hamburg, in 1999. He is also a Distinguished Supporter of Humanists UK. He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2000 New Year Honours for services to literature. In 2005, he was the first recipient of Dickinson College&#x27;s Harold and Ethel L. Stellfox Visiting Scholar and Writers Program Award, in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. In 2008, McEwan was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Literature by University College London, where he had previously taught English literature.

In 2006, the Board of Trustees of the Kenyon Review honoured McEwan with the Kenyon Review Award for Literary Achievement, writing that &quot;McEwan&#x27;s stories, novels, and plays are notable for their fierce artistic dramas, exploring unanticipated and often brutal collisions between the ordinary and the extraordinary&quot;. In 2008, &quot;The Times&quot; named McEwan among their list of &quot;The 50 greatest British writers since 1945&quot;. In 2010, McEwan received the Peggy V. Helmerich Distinguished Author Award. The Helmerich Award is presented annually by the Tulsa Library Trust.

On 20 February 2011, McEwan was awarded the Jerusalem Prize for the Freedom of the Individual in Society. He accepted the prize, despite controversy and pressure from groups and individuals opposed to the Israeli government. McEwan responded to his critics, and specifically the group British Writers in Support of Palestine (BWISP), in a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, stating in part, &quot;There are ways in which art can have a longer reach than politics, and for me the emblem in this respect is Daniel Barenboim&#x27;s West-Eastern Divan Orchestra – surely a beam of hope in a dark landscape, though denigrated by the Israeli religious right and Hamas. If BWISP is against this particular project, then clearly we have nothing more to say to each other&quot;. McEwan&#x27;s acceptance speech discussed the complaints against him and provided further insight into his reasons for accepting the award. He also said he will donate the amount of the prize, &quot;ten thousand dollars to Combatants for Peace, an organisation that brings together Israeli ex-soldiers and Palestinian ex-fighters&quot;.

In 2012, the University of Sussex presented McEwan with its 50th Anniversary Gold Medal in recognition of his contributions to literature. In 2014, the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas paid $2 million for McEwan&#x27;s literary archives. The archives include drafts of all of his later novels. McEwan commented that his novel &quot;Atonement&quot; started out as a science fiction story set &quot;two or three centuries in the future&quot;. In 2018, McEwan was awarded the Bauer-&quot;Incroci di civiltà&quot; prize in Venice for his literary career. In 2019, McEwan received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

In 2020, McEwan was awarded the Goethe Medal, a yearly prize given by the Goethe-Institut honouring non-Germans &quot;who have performed outstanding service for the German language and for international cultural relations&quot;. According to the jury, McEwan&#x27;s literary work (&quot;Machines like us&quot;) is &quot;imbued with the essence of contradiction and critical, depth-psychological reflection of social phenomena&quot;. Despite harsh attacks in his own country, the writer &quot;openly defends himself against narrow-minded nationalisms&quot; and appears as a passionate pro-European. He was appointed Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in the 2023 Birthday Honours for services to literature.

==Views on religion and politics==
In 2008, McEwan publicly spoke out against Islamism for its views on women and on homosexuality. He was quoted as saying that fundamentalist Islam wanted to create a society that he &quot;abhorred&quot;. His comments appeared in the Italian newspaper to defend fellow writer Martin Amis against allegations of racism. McEwan, an atheist, said that certain streams of Christianity were &quot;equally absurd&quot; and that he did not &quot;like these medieval visions of the world according to which God is coming to save the faithful and to damn the others&quot;. McEwan put forward the following statement on his official site and blog after claiming he was misinterpreted:
:Certain remarks of mine to an Italian journalist have been widely misrepresented in the UK press, and on various websites. Contrary to reports, my remarks were not about Islam, but about Islamism – perhaps &#x27;extremism&#x27; would be a better term. I grew up in a Muslim country – Libya – and have only warm memories of a dignified, tolerant and hospitable Islamic culture. I was referring in my interview to a tiny minority who preach violent jihad, who incite hatred and violence against &#x27;infidels&#x27;, apostates, Jews and homosexuals; who in their speeches and on their websites speak passionately against free thought, pluralism, democracy, unveiled women; who will tolerate no other interpretation of Islam but their own and have vilified Sufism and other strands of Islam as apostasy; who have murdered, among others, fellow Muslims by the thousands in the market places of Iraq, Algeria and in the Sudan. Countless Islamic writers, journalists and religious authorities have expressed their disgust at this extremist violence. To speak against such things is hardly &#x27;astonishing&#x27; on my part (&quot;Independent on Sunday&quot;) or original, nor is it &#x27;Islamophobic&#x27; and &#x27;right-wing&#x27; as one official of the Muslim Council of Britain insists, and nor is it to endorse the failures and brutalities of US foreign policy. It is merely to invoke a common humanity which I hope would be shared by all religions as well as all non-believers.&#x27;

In 2007, Christopher Hitchens dedicated his book &quot;God Is Not Great&quot; to McEwan. In 2008, McEwan was among more than 200,000 signatories of a petition to support Italian journalist Roberto Saviano who received multiple death threats and was placed in police protection after exposing the Mafia-like crime syndicate, Camorra, in his 2006 book &quot;Gomorrah&quot;. McEwan said he hoped the petition would help &quot;galvanize&quot; the Italian police into taking seriously the &quot;fundamental matter of civil rights and free speech&quot;. McEwan also signed a petition to support the release of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian woman sentenced to death by stoning after being convicted of committing adultery. In 2009, McEwan joined the 10:10 project, a movement that supports positive action on climate change by encouraging people to reduce their carbon emissions. On winning the Jerusalem Prize in 2011, McEwan defended himself against criticism for accepting the prize in light of opposition to Israeli policies, saying: &quot;If you didn&#x27;t go to countries whose foreign policy or domestic policy is screwed up, you&#x27;d never get out of bed&quot;. On accepting the honour, he spoke in favour of Israel&#x27;s existence, security, and freedoms, while strongly attacking Hamas, Israel&#x27;s policies in Gaza, and the expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories; these were notable words since the audience included politicians such as the Israeli President Shimon Peres and Nir Barkat, the mayor of Jerusalem. McEwan also personally attended a protest in Sheikh Jarrah against the expansion of Israeli settlements.

In 2013, McEwan sharply criticised Stephen Hawking for boycotting a conference in Israel as well as the boycott campaign in general, stating that there are many countries &quot;whose governments we might loathe or disapprove of&quot; but &quot;Israel–Palestine has become sort of tribal and a touchstone for a certain portion of the intellectual classes. I say this in the context of thinking it is profoundly wrong of the Israeli government not to be pursuing more actively and positively and creatively a solution with the Palestinians. That&#x27;s why I think one wants to go to these places to make the point. Turning away will not produce any result.&quot; That same year, as part of a wide-ranging interview with &quot;Channel 4 News&quot;, McEwan discussed the furore that surrounded his remarks on Islamism in 2008, stating: &quot;I remember getting a lot of stick five or six years ago saying something disobliging about jihadists. There were voices, particularly on the left, that thought anyone who criticised Islamism was really criticising Islam and therefore racist. Well, those voices have gone quiet because the local atrocities committed by Islamists whether in Pakistan or Mali is so self-evidently vile.&quot; In the same interview, McEwan remarked that he felt protesters of the 2003 Iraq War were &quot;vindicated&quot; by what happened subsequently; argued that the chief legacy of the Iraq War was that &quot;sometimes there are things we could do [before that war] which we no longer can&quot; in foreign affairs; stated that at one point prior to the 2003 invasion he had hoped to be able to seek an audience with Tony Blair to persuade him not to go ahead with the war; and as someone who voted for the Liberal Democrats in the 2010 UK general election that the then current coalition government of the United Kingdom should end, stating &quot;Let&#x27;s either have a Tory government or let Ed Miliband try something different&quot; to try and turn around a country of &quot;great inequity&quot;. McEwan is traditionally a Labour Party supporter and said he had his &quot;fingers crossed&quot; that Miliband would become prime minister.

Following the referendum on the United Kingdom&#x27;s membership of the European Union resulting in a win for the Leave or Brexit campaign in June 2016, McEwan wrote a critical opinion article for &quot;The Guardian&quot; titled &quot;Britain is changed utterly. Unless this summer is just a bad dream&quot;, published on 9 July 2016. In the article, McEwan wrote of the consequences of the Brexit vote: &quot;Everything is changed utterly. Or about to be, as soon as your new leader is chosen. The country you live in, the parliamentary democracy that ruled it, for good or bad, has been trumped by a plebiscite of dubious purpose and unacknowledged status. From our agriculture to our science and our universities, from our law to our international relations to our commerce and trade and politics, and who and what we are in the world – all is up for a curious, unequal renegotiation with our European neighbours&quot;. McEwan&#x27;s piece appeared to conclude with a sense of bewilderment and unease at how events were panning out, anticipating the ascension of Theresa May to the leadership of the Conservative Party and her appointment as prime minister, and noting how the previously unthinkable in British politics had actually happened. McEwan&#x27;s article was published on 9 July, and May effectively won the 2016 Conservative Party leadership election on 11 July, which precipitated her appointment as prime minister two days later. In May 2017, speaking at a London conference on Brexit, apparently referring to what he believed to be the older demographic of leave voters, McEwan stated that &quot;one and a half million oldsters freshly in their graves&quot; would result in a putative second referendum returning a Remain outcome.

==Personal life==
McEwan lives in London, and has been married twice. His first marriage was to Penny Allen, an astrologer and alternative practitioner, with whom he had two sons. The marriage ended in 1995. Two years later in 1997, McEwan married Annalena McAfee, a journalist and writer who was formerly the editor of The &quot;Guardian″s Review&quot; section.

In 2002, McEwan discovered that he had a brother who had been given up for adoption during the Second World War; the story became public in 2007. The brother, a bricklayer named David Sharp, was born six years earlier than McEwan when their mother was married to a different man. Sharp has the same mother and father as McEwan but was born from an affair that occurred before they married. After her first husband was killed in combat, McEwan&#x27;s mother married her lover, and Ian was born a few years later. The brothers are in regular contact and McEwan has written a foreword to Sharp&#x27;s memoir.

McEwan was a long-time friend of the writer and polemicist Christopher Hitchens.

<text>Aqila al-Hashimi (Arabic عقيلة الهاشمي &quot;cAqīla al-Hāshimī&quot;; 1953 - September 25, 2005) was an Iraqi politician who served on the Iraqi Governing Council.

Aqila al-Hashimi was born in 1953 into a prominent Shi&#x27;ite religious family in Najaf. She gained a degree in law in Iraq and a doctorate in French Literature at the Sorbonne.

She joined the Foreign Ministry in 1979 working as a French translator for Tariq Aziz. Al-Hashimi ran the Oil-for-Food Programme in the Foreign Ministry under Saddam Hussein.

She was one of only three women on the IGC and the only member of the former regime to have been on the council. She had been expected to become Iraq&#x27;s new Ambassador to the United Nations

She died of abdomen wounds suffered five days earlier when her convoy was ambushed by six men in a pickup truck near her home in western Baghdad. The killing was blamed on supporters of the former president, Saddam Hussein.

The British politician George Galloway, who was strongly opposed to the war and who referred to attacks on coalition forces as a “bloody good hiding,” discussed her participation in the Governing Council in an interview shortly after her death, saying that although he derived no pleasure from her death, he denounced her role in the Iraqi Governing Council, calling her a &quot;puppet minister.&quot;

<doc id="327092" wikidata="Q318126" url="?curid=327092" title="Ernst Öpik">
<text>Ernst Julius Öpik ( – 10 September 1985) was an Estonian astronomer and astrophysicist who spent the second half of his career (1948–1981) at the Armagh Observatory in Northern Ireland. He is best known for his pioneering work on solar system dynamics, particularly of the Oort cloud and the Yarkovsky effect.

==Education==
Öpik was born in Kunda, Kreis Wierland, Governorate of Estonia then a part of the Russian Empire. He went to the University of Moscow to specialize in the study of minor bodies, such as asteroids, comets, and meteors. He completed his 1923 doctorate at the University of Tartu.

==Astronomical work==
He was the first and longest serving editor of the Irish Astronomical Journal (1950 to 1980) and frequently published his own research there. In 1916 he published an article there in which he estimated the densities of visual binary stars. Using the white dwarf star ο2 Eridani B, he
determined its density as 25,000 times the density of the Sun but concluded that the result is impossible.

In 1922 he published a paper in which he estimated the distance to the Andromeda Galaxy. He determined the distance using a novel astrophysical method based on the observed rotational velocities of the galaxy, which depends on the total mass around which stars are rotating, and on the assumption that the luminosity per unit mass was the same as that of our galaxy. He concluded that the distance was 450 kpc. His result was in good accordance with other estimates of these days (100 to 1000 kpc) and were closer to recent estimates (778 kpc) than Hubble&#x27;s result (275 kpc). His method is still widely used.

In 1922 he correctly predicted the frequency of craters on Mars long before they were detected by space probes. 

In 1932 he postulated a theory concerning the origins of comets in the Solar System. He believed that they originated in a cloud orbiting far beyond the orbit of Pluto. This cloud is now known as the Oort cloud or alternatively the Öpik-Oort Cloud in his honour. From October 1931 to the end of July 1933, Öpik, Harlow Shapley and Samuel L. Boothroyd headed the Arizona meteor expedition, which detected approximately 22,000 meteors. He also invented a rocking camera for the study of meteors. In 1951 he published a paper concerning the triple-alpha process, describing the burning of helium-4 into carbon-12 in the cores of red giant stars. However, this achievement is often overlooked because Edwin Salpeter&#x27;s paper on the same subject had already been published by the time Öpik&#x27;s paper reached Britain and the United States.

==Yarkovsky effect connection==
The Yarkovsky effect was discovered by the Russian civil engineer Ivan Osipovich Yarkovsky (1844–1902), who worked on scientific problems in his spare time. Writing in a pamphlet around the year 1900, Yarkovsky noted that the diurnal heating of a rotating object in space would cause it to experience a force that, while tiny, could lead to large long-term effects in the orbits of small bodies, especially meteoroids and small asteroids. Yarkovsky&#x27;s work might have been forgotten had it not been for Öpik, who read Yarkovsky&#x27;s pamphlet sometime around 1909. Decades later, Öpik discussed the possible importance of the Yarkovsky effect for moving meteoroids about the solar system.

==Exile==
Öpik fled his native country in 1944 because the approaching Red Army raised fear among Estonians. Living as a refugee in Germany, he became the Estonian rector of the Baltic University in Exile in the displaced persons camps. In 1948 he was offered a post in Armagh and remained there despite offers of lucrative jobs in America. From the early 1960s to the mid-1970s he also held a position at the University of Maryland, which he visited annually, typically for one semester. As air travel became more common, his refusal to fly made travel to the U.S. from Armagh systematically more difficult and he eventually ceased the annual ritual.

==Awards==
He won the J. Lawrence Smith Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1960, the Meteoritical Society Frederick C. Leonard Memorial Medal in 1968, the Kepler Gold Medal from the American Association for the Advancement of Science &amp; Meteoritical Society in 1972, the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1975 and the Bruce Medal in 1976.

==Legacy==
The Oort cloud is sometimes called &quot;Öpik-Oort cloud&quot;. The Comet Interceptor&#x27;s Optical Periscopic Imager for Comets (OPIC) instrument is named after Ernst Öpik to celebrate the first Estonia&#x27;s contribution to a science mission of the European Space Agency.

The asteroid 2099 Öpik is named in his honour. The crater Öpik on the Martian moon Phobos is also named for him.

He was the father of the atomic physicist Uuno Öpik. His grandson, Lembit Öpik, was the Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament for Montgomeryshire in Wales from 1997 to 2010.

<text>King Gong of Zhou (; died 900 BC), personal name Ji Yihu, was a king of China&#x27;s Zhou dynasty. Estimated dates of his reign are 922–900 BC or 917/15–900.

== Biography ==
King Gong of Zhou ascended to the throne in the year 922 BC after his father King Mu of Zhou departed. Unlike some of his ancestors, he dedicated to developing economy and increasing his exchequer, instead of expanding territory or conquering others through wars.

According to one account carried by the Records of the Grand Historian, King Gong of Zhou once did initiate a war and destroyed the State of Mi. When he was touring in State of Mi, he saw three extremely beautiful women and commanded Mi&#x27;s lord to find them out and send them to his own palace. But the lord of the state took the three extremely beautiful women as his own concubines, which irritated King Gong. So he invaded this state and sentenced that lord to death.

After 15 years reign, he passed the throne to his son King Yì of Zhou and departed peacefully in his own palace.

<doc id="327097" wikidata="Q459763" url="?curid=327097" title="Rotuma">
<text>Rotuma () is a self-governing heptarchy, generally designated a dependency of Fiji. Rotuma commonly refers to the Rotuma Island, the only permanently inhabited and by far the largest of all the islands in the Rotuma Group. Officially, the Rotuma Act declares that Rotuma consists of Rotuma Island as well as its neighbouring islands, rocks, and reefs across the entire Rotuma Group. The dependency is situated around 500 km west of the French islands of Wallis and Futuna and a similar distance north of the Fijian mainland. Its capital is Ahau, a hamlet consisting of a number of colonial-era buildings. Rotuma exists as a dependency of Fiji but itself contains its own socioreligious pene-enclave known traditionally as &quot;Faguta&quot; where the chiefs (of Juju and Pepjei) and their villages adhere to the practices of worship, festival dates, and French-based writing system of the Marists, based at Sumi.

The island group is home to a large and unique Polynesian indigenous ethnic group which constitutes a recognisable minority within the population of Fiji, known as &quot;Rotumans&quot;. Its population at the 2017 census was 1,594, although many more Rotumans live on mainland Fijian islands, totaling 10,000.

== History ==

=== Origins according to oral history ===

Rotuma was first inhabited according to record by people of Tahiti Nui, Marquesas, and Rapa Nui. At that time, it was known as Siria. Little was known about the exact years of migration from these far Eastern Kingdoms of those times. The only information known was that Rotuma was used by these three Kingdoms as the royal burial ground for the Kings and Queens of Tahiti Nui and Rapa Nui. Rotuma was known as Siria by the indigenous peoples of Tahiti Nui and Rapa Nui as it was named after the star which lies exactly above the location of the island. Thus, the people of those days prayed to a mythical figure known as Tagaroa Siria. In remembrance of this old royal burial ground, a certain species of seaweed was given as a token of blood ties to remember the old and special bonds between Tahiti Nui and Rotuma. This particular species of seaweed is a delicacy amongst the islands, but it only grows on Tahiti and Rotuma. This seaweed species was said to be given by a Princess of Bora Bora. The Princess name was Teura (Redness) of Bora Bora who married the Legendary Prince Te-Fatu of Rotuma.

The first foreigner to arrive in Rotuma is sometimes named in oral tradition as Bulou ni Wasa who arrived with her seven brothers. The name of the canoe that brought her and her family was known as &quot;Rogovoka&quot;. Her brothers left her on the island and made their way to Fiji. When she disembarked on Rotuma onto a rock which her priests called Vatu Vonu (Haf kafaghoi ta), the rulers of Rotuma are said to have immediately given her the name Tafatemasian, coincidently the same meaning as Adi Rarama ni Wasa (a spirit encircled with light). Without meeting her, some say Prince Sarefua and Princess Tefuimena decided that she be installed immediately as the ruler of the island as a gesture of welcome and therefore persuaded her to stay and rule the island.

Later settlers of the islands it was widely said, in myths which came from Samoa, were led by a man named Raho. In 1896, the scholar Friedrich Ratzel recorded a Samoan legend about Samoans&#x27; relationship to Rotuma:

&quot;Thus the Samoans relate that one of their chiefs fished in the vicinity of Rotuma and then planted coco-palms on the main island. In a later migration the chief Tokaniua came that way with a canoe full of men and quarrelled with the Samoan chief Raho about who had the right of possession.&quot;

=== Rotuman Revolution ===

While Tongan forces invaded and occupied the island at one point in the 17th century, managing to consolidate their hold over the island and its people, eventually the Rotumans rebelled. According to the Acting-Resident Commissioner of Rotuma W.E. Russell, Rotumans ultimately overthrew their Tongan occupiers in a bloody uprising that took place over a single night.

===European contact===

Tupaia&#x27;s Map is among the most important artifacts to have come from late 18th-century European–Indigenous encounters in the South Pacific region and features, in Epeli Hau‘ofa&#x27;s terms, a &quot;sea of islands&quot; extending for more than 7,000 km from Rotuma in the west to Rapa Nui in the east and more than 5,000 km from Hawai‘i in the north to New Zealand in the south. The earliest known confirmed European sighting of Rotuma was in 1791, when Captain Edward Edwards and the crew of HMS &quot;Pandora&quot; landed in search of sailors who had disappeared following the Mutiny on the Bounty. Some scholars have suggested that the first European to sight the island was, instead, Pedro Fernandes de Queirós; his description of an island he sighted is consistent with the characteristics and location of Rotuma. However, this possibility has not been conclusively substantiated.

===France, Catholicism, and Coquille===

In 1824, French surgeon and naturalist René Lesson arrived in Rotuma onboard the vessel &quot;Coquille&quot;. Lesson observed that the Rotumans had no awareness of an afterlife; his revelation of such an idea therefore made French Catholicism, the official religion of the state of his employ, the Kingdom of France, the first faith shared with the Rotumans. His catechising would subsequently be formalised and reinforced by French Marists two decades later, most especially in the formerly conjoined chiefdoms of Faguta, Pepjei and Juju, as well as extending into neighbouring districts, especially Itutiu.

===Whaling===

A favorite of whaling ships in need of reprovisioning, in the mid-nineteenth century Rotuma also became a haven for runaway sailors, some of whom were escaped convicts. Some of these deserters married local women and contributed their genes to an already heterogeneous pool; others met violent ends, reportedly at one another&#x27;s hands. The first recorded whaleship to visit was the &quot;Loper&quot; in 1825, and the last known visit was by the &quot;Charles W. Morgan&quot; in 1894. Rotuma was visited as part of the United States Exploring Expedition in 1840.

===Tongan invasion and the Wesleyan agenda===

In the 1850s and 1860s, the Tongan prince Ma&#x27;afu claimed possession of Rotuma and sent his subordinates to administer the main island and its neighboring islets. Ma&#x27;afu had earlier made a serious effort to spread his Wesleyan beliefs to eastern Fiji and the Tongan invasion of Rotuma allowed him to consolidate its hold over a new group, the Rotumans in the north of the island.

===Cession to Britain===

Wesleyan missionaries from Tonga arrived on Rotuma in June 1841, followed by Catholic Marists in 1847. The Roman Catholic missionaries withdrew in 1853 but returned in 1868. Conflicts between the two groups, fuelled by previous political rivalries among the chiefs of Rotuma&#x27;s seven districts, resulted in hostilities that led the local chiefs in 1879 to ask Britain to annex the island group. On 13 May 1881, Rotuma was officially ceded to the United Kingdom, when the British flag was hoisted by Hugh Romilly. The event is annually celebrated as Rotuma Day.

In 1881, a group of Rotuman chiefs travelled to Levuka, Ovalau, Fiji, to meet Queen Victoria&#x27;s official representative to complete the process of cession. A memorial to the seven chiefs and their mission is located in the District of Itutiu. In response to the cession, Queen Victoria bestowed the name of Albert on the paramount chief at the time - Gagaj Vaniak - in honour of her beloved husband, Prince Albert, who had died twenty years before. In June 2017, Pene Saggers (née Enasio) met with Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and together they spoke about the links between their ancestral lines and the cession of Rotuma.

After Rotuma was ceded to the United Kingdom, it was governed as part of the Colony of Fiji. Rotuma remained with Fiji after Fiji&#x27;s independence in 1970 and the military coups of 1987.

== Geography and geology ==

The Rotuma group of volcanic islands are located (Suva to Ahau) north of Fiji. Rotuma Island itself is long and wide, with a land area of approximately , making it the 12th-largest of the Fiji islands.

The island is bisected by an isthmus into a larger eastern part and a western peninsula. The isthmus is low and narrow, only wide, and is the site of Motusa village (Itutiu district). North of the isthmus is Maka Bay, and in the south is Hapmafau Bay. There is a large population of coral reefs in these bays, and there are boat passages through them.

Rotuma is a shield volcano made of alkali-olivine basalt and hawaiite, with many small cones. It reaches above sea level at Mount Suelhof, near the center of the island. Satarua Peak, high, lies near the eastern end of the island. While they are very secluded from much of Fiji proper, the large reef and untouched beaches are renowned as some of the most beautiful in the Republic of Fiji.

There are several islands that lie between and distant from the main island, but are still within the fringing reef. They are: 
*Solnohu (south)
*Solkope and Sarii (southeast)
*Afgaha and Husia Rua (far southeast)
*Husia (Husiatiu) and Husiameamea (close southeast)
*Hạuameamea and Hạua (Hạuatiu) (close together northeast).

There is also a separate chain of islands that lie between and to the northwest and west of Rotuma Island. In order, from northeast to southwest, these are:

*Uea
*Hạfhai
*Hạfhahoi
*Hạfhaveiaglolo
*Hatana
*Hạfliua.

The geological features of this island contribute to its national significance, as outlined in Fiji&#x27;s Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan.

Pigs are so widespread in Rotuma their stone enclosures are a prominent feature of the island. Scientists conducting a botanical survey of the island in 2000 even remarked on this:

&quot;Pig rearing, often within elaborate stonewalled pens, is also an integral component of the agricultural system and has been recognized by Rotumans as having a considerable impact.&quot;

The Acting-Resident Commissioner of Rotuma, W.E. Russell, dubbed this network of stone pig sty fences the &quot;Great Wall of Rotuma&quot;.

==Climate==

==Flora and fauna==
A area covering the main island and its small satellite islets is the Rotuma Important Bird Area. The Important Bird Area covers the entire range of the vulnerable Rotuma myzomela, and the Rotuman subspecies of Polynesian starling and Fiji shrikebill. Rotuma also supports isolated outlying populations of Crimson-crowned fruit dove and Polynesian triller. The offshore islets of Haatana, Hofliua and Hatawa have nationally significant seabird colonies.

== Demographics ==

Although the island has been politically part of Fiji since 1881, Rotumans are Polynesians and their culture more closely resembles that of the Polynesian islands to the east, most noticeably Tahiti, Tonga, Samoa, Futuna, and Uvea. Because of their Polynesian appearance and distinctive language, Rotumans now constitute a recognizable minority group within the Republic of Fiji. The great majority of Rotumans (9,984 according to the 2007 Fiji census) now live elsewhere in Fiji, with 1,953 Rotumans remaining on Rotuma.

Rotumans are staunchly conservative culturally and maintain their customs in the face of changes brought about by increased contact with the outside world; social trends which have emerged elsewhere have remained entirely unwelcome in Rotuma. As recently as 1985, some 85 percent of Rotumans voted against opening the island up to tourism, concerned about the impact of an influx of secular tourist outsiders. P&amp;O Cruises landed on the island only twice in the 1980s. Rotumans&#x27; inherent conservatism has led to a strict form of sociodemographic preservation. Indians and Chinese have no presence in Rotuma, unlike other Fijian islands, where these groups have managed to acquire property and establish themselves; this is because in Rotuma landholdings are held exclusively for the use and benefit of the island&#x27;s own Rotuman people.

== Politics and society ==

===Political offices===

Rotuma is divided into seven districts, each with its own chief (Gagaj es Ituu). The district chiefs and elected district representatives make up the Rotuma Island Council. The districts are divided into subgroupings of households (hoaga) that function as work groups under the leadership of a subchief (gagaj es hoaga). All district headmen and the majority of hoaga headmen are titled. In addition, some men hold titles without headship (as tög), although they are expected to exercise leadership roles in support of the district headman. Titles, which are held for life, belong to specified house sites (fuạg ri). All the descendants of previous occupants of a fuạg ri have a right to participate in the selection of successors to titles.

On formal occasions, titled men and dignitaries such as priests, ministers, government representatives, and distinguished visitors occupy a place of honor. They are ceremonially served food from special baskets and kava. In the daily routine of village life, however, they are not especially privileged. As yet no significant class distinctions based on wealth or control of resources have emerged, but investments in elaborate housing and motor vehicles by a few families have led to visible differences in standard of living.

At the time of arrival by Europeans, there were three pan-Rotuman political positions created by the Samoan invaders: the fakpure, the sạu, and the mua. The fakpure acted as convener and presiding officer over the council of district headmen and was responsible for appointing the sạu and ensuring that he was cared for properly. The fakpure was headman of the district that headed the alliance that had won the last war. The sạu&#x27;s role was to take part in the ritual cycle, oriented toward ensuring prosperity, as an object of veneration. Early European visitors referred to the sạu as &quot;king&quot;, but he actually had no secular power. The position of sạu was supposed to rotate between districts, and a breach of this custom was considered to be incitement to war. The role of mua is more obscure, but like the sạu, he was an active participant in the ritual cycle. According to some accounts the mua acted as a kind of high priest.

Following Christianisation in the 1860s, the offices of sạu and mua were terminated. Colonial administration involved the appointment by the governor of Fiji of a Resident Commissioner (after 1935, a District Officer) to Rotuma. He was advised by a council composed of the district chiefs. In 1940 the council was expanded to include an elected representative from each district and the Assistant Medical Practitioner. Following Fiji&#x27;s independence in 1970, the council assumed responsibility for the internal governance of Rotuma, with the District Officer assigned to an advisory role. Up until the first coup, Rotuma was represented in the Fiji legislature by a single senator.

===Elections===

Administratively, Rotuma is fully incorporated into Fiji, but with local government so tailored as to give the island a measure of autonomy greater than that enjoyed by other political subdivisions of Fiji. At the national level, in the past Fijian citizens of Rotuman descent elected one representative to the Fijian House of Representatives, and the Council of Rotuma nominated one representative to the Fijian Senate. Rotuma was also represented in the influential Great Council of Chiefs by three representatives chosen by the Council of Rotuma. For electoral purposes, Rotumans were formerly classified as Fijians, but when the Constitution was revised in 1997–1998, they were granted separate representation at their own request. (The majority of seats in Fiji&#x27;s House of Representatives are allocated on a communal basis to Fiji&#x27;s various ethnic groups.) In addition, Rotuma forms part (along with Taveuni and the Lau Islands) of the Lau Taveuni Rotuma Open Constituency, one of 25 constituencies whose representatives are chosen by universal suffrage.

===Social control===

The &quot;hoaga&quot;, a kinship community, was the basic residential unit in pre-contact Rotuma. The basis for social control is a strong socialisation emphasis on social responsibility and a sensitivity to shaming. Gossip serves as a mechanism for sanctioning deviation, but the most powerful deterrent to antisocial behavior is an abiding belief in imminent justice, that supernatural forces (the atua or spirits of ancestors) will punish wrongdoing. Rotumans are a rather gentle people; violence is extremely rare and serious crimes nearly nonexistent.

===Conflict===

Prior to cession, warfare, though conducted on a modest scale, was endemic in Rotuma. During the colonial era political rivalries were muted, since power was concentrated in the offices of Resident Commissioner and District Officer. Following Fiji&#x27;s independence, however, interdistrict rivalries were again given expression, now in the form of political contention. Following the second coup, when Fiji left the Commonwealth of Nations, a segment of the Rotuman population, known as the &quot;Mölmahao Clan&quot; of Noatau rejected the council&#x27;s decision to remain with the newly declared republic. Arguing that Rotuma had been ceded to the United Kingdom and not to Fiji, in 1987 these rebels attempted to form an independent aristocratic maritime republic which they called the Republic of Rotuma but they were promptly charged with sedition and the entity disintegrated almost immediately. It did not have any substantive support and while majority opinion appears to favor remaining with Fiji some rumblings of discontent remain.

== Territorial divisions ==

Rotuma&#x27;s seven districts can be grouped into three agglomerations: the medial and northern districts, the capital district, and the traditional territory of Faguta (whose special character was effectively agreed to by all Rotuma&#x27;s chiefs in 1871 in the Treaty of Hamelin).

===Medial and northern districts===

====Noatau====

Noatau (extreme southeast) contains the villages Fekeioko, Maragteu, Fafiasina, Matuea, Ututu, and Kalvaka.

====Oinafa====

Oinafa (east) contains the villages Oinafa, Lopta, and Paptea.

====Malhaha====

Malhaha (north) contains the villages Pepheua, Elsee, and Elsio.

====Itumuta====

Itumuta (western peninsula) contains the villages Maftoa and Lopo.

===Capital district===

====Itutiu====

Itutiu (west, but east of western peninsula) contains the villages Savlei, Lạu, Feavại, Tuạkoi, Motusa, Hapmak, Losa, and Fapufa.

Ahạu, also located in the District of Itutiu, is the capital and where the &quot;tariạgsạu&quot; (traditionally the name of the sạu&#x27;s palace) meeting house for the Council of Rotuma is based which functions as Rotuma&#x27;s seat of government.

===Faguta===

The southern part of Rotuma is known traditionally as &quot;Faguta&quot;, a territory encompassing Juju and Pepjei, whose chiefs lead socioreligious communities which follow the ecclesiastical, cultural, and linguistic teachings of the Marists of France.

Ituu is a Rotuman geographic term typically considered equivalent to a chiefdom or district.

====Timeline of Faguta====

The main island in the Rotuma Group was formerly partitioned into five parts. One of these parts, Faguta, was located to the south of Rotuma Island, across the strait from Solnohu island. Faguta&#x27;s chief, alongside the chief of Noatau, were generally considered the most influential of all those across the island and effectively governed the island&#x27;s south and north, respectively. The significance of these two chiefs was reflected in the fact that the position of the head of the island&#x27;s governing council alternated between the chief of Faguta and the chief of Noatau, depending on which of the two had been victorious in the last conflict between them. However, following victory and invasion by opposing forces (internecine conflict was endemic for centuries on Rotuma), Faguta was forcibly divided into two by the other districts&#x27; chiefs in an effort to weaken its influence, thereby forming Juju and Pepjei (although the territory is still commonly referred to by the two districts&#x27; inhabitants and descendants as &quot;Faguta&quot;).

====Mythology centred around Faguta====

Solnohu, a islet off the southern coast of Faguta roughly equidistant between its constituent districts, is the location of a significant local myth, &quot;The turtle of Sol Onau&quot;. The myth tells of two local girls who fall from atop the island into the sea below. There, the two were transformed into sea turtles, one red and one white. Local beliefs hold that these two turtles, called &#x27;Eao&#x27;, continue to live around the coral of the rock and will resurface if a particular chant is performed.

J. Stanley Gardiner, who visited the island and wrote extensively on the locals&#x27; customs and myths wrote that he took Gagaj Mou, the chief of Pepjei, and five girls to recite the traditional chant. Gardiner recorded that from his vantage point out front he actually noticed the appearance of a green turtle. Green sea turtles are often located in the waters of Fiji and Rotuma.

He also recorded that Mou, the chief, as well as the others stated that they had regularly seen the turtle and that beach between Faguta and Solnohu was a frequently used feeding spot for the reptile.

====Fagutan culture====

Fagutan people, like all Rotumans, celebrate the traditional festival of Fara. This involves the residents of Faguta&#x27;s villages (Juju, Tuại, Haga, Ujia, Uạnheta, and Avave) visiting other village communities, singing and dancing, where they are often invited inside by the local hosts. In exchange, the guests are served watermelon as a sort of reward for providing entertainment and are often doused in perfume, talcum powder, or turmeric. Across the island, these sorts of celebrations continue until mid-January. Fagutan Fara however begins much later in December (on December 24) than celebrations held elsewhere on the island.

====Notable Fagutans====

The term &quot;Fagutan&quot; commonly refers to those who live in the two Fagutan districts (Juju and Pepjei) or those with cultural or family ties to the area. Notable examples include:

*Charles Chowe Howard: beachcomber and longtime resident of Faguta. The village of Haga (written as &quot;Hanga&quot;) in Juju was said to be primarily populated by Howard&#x27;s own descendants, and it was theorised by the Acting-Resident Commissioner of Rotuma W.E. Russell that this bloodline contributed to these Fagutans&#x27; paler complexions when compared with other Pacific islanders and their referring to themselves as &quot;white&quot; and other islanders as &quot;black men&quot;.
*Christine Rovoi: journalist, essayist, and writer in Fiji and New Zealand. Rovoi was born in Suva but with Fagutan ties was taught Rotuman using the French-based orthography used in Faguta.

<doc id="327121" wikidata="Q4398917" url="?curid=327121" title="Quicksilver (novel)">
<text>Quicksilver is a historical novel by Neal Stephenson, published in 2003. It is the first volume of &quot;The Baroque Cycle&quot;, his late Baroque historical fiction series, succeeded by &quot;The Confusion&quot; and &quot;The System of the World&quot; (both published in 2004). &quot;Quicksilver&quot; won the Arthur C. Clarke Award and was nominated for the Locus Award in 2004. Stephenson organized the structure of &quot;Quicksilver&quot; such that chapters have been incorporated into three internal books titled &quot;Quicksilver&quot;, &quot;The King of the Vagabonds&quot;, and &quot;Odalisque&quot;. In 2006, each internal book was released in separate paperback editions, to make the 900 pages more approachable for readers. These internal books were originally independent novels within the greater cycle during composition.

The novel &quot;Quicksilver&quot; is written in various narrative styles, such as theatrical staging and epistolary, and follows a large group of characters. Though mostly set in England, France, and the United Provinces in the period 1655 through 1673, the first book includes a frame story set in late 1713 Massachusetts. In order to write the novel, Stephenson researched the period extensively and integrates events and historical themes important to historical scholarship throughout the novel. However, Stephenson alters details such as the members of the Cabal ministry, the historical cabinet of Charles II of England, to facilitate the incorporation of his fictional characters. Within the historical context, Stephenson also deals with many themes which pervade his other works, including the exploration of knowledge, communication and cryptography.

The plot of the first and third books focus on Daniel Waterhouse&#x27;s exploits as a natural philosopher and friend to the young Isaac Newton and his later observations of English politics and religion, respectively. The second book introduces the vagabond Jack Shaftoe (&quot;King of the Vagabonds&quot;) and Eliza (a former member of a Turkish harem) as they cross Europe, eventually landing in the Netherlands, where Eliza becomes entangled in commerce and politics. &quot;Quicksilver&quot; operates in the same fictional universe as Stephenson&#x27;s earlier novel &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;, in which descendants of &quot;Quicksilver&quot; characters Shaftoe and Waterhouse appear prominently.

==Background and development==
During the period in which he wrote &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;, Stephenson read George Dyson&#x27;s &quot;Darwin Amongst the Machines&quot;, which led him to Gottfried Leibniz&#x27;s interest in a computing machine, the Leibniz–Newton feud, and Newton&#x27;s work at the Royal Treasury. He considered this &quot;striking when [he] was already working on a book about money and a book about computers,&quot; and became inspired to write about the period. Originally intended to be included in &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;, Stephenson instead used the material as the foundation for &quot;Quicksilver&quot;, the first volume of the &quot;Baroque Cycle&quot;. The research for the sprawling historical novel created what Stephenson called &quot;data management problems&quot;, and he resorted to a system of notebooks to record research, track characters, and find material during the writing process.

===Historicity===
In &quot;Quicksilver&quot;, Stephenson places the ancestors of the &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;″s characters in Enlightenment Europe alongside a cast of historical individuals from Restoration England and the Enlightenment. Amongst the cast are some of the most prominent natural philosophers, mathematicians and scientists (Newton and Leibniz), and politicians (William of Orange and Nassau) of the age. In an interview, Stephenson explained he deliberately depicted both the historical and fictional characters as authentic representatives of historical classes of people, such as the Vagabonds as personified by Jack, and the Barbary slaves as personified by Eliza. In his research for the characters, he explored the major scholarship about the period.

Stephenson did extensive research on the Age of Enlightenment, noting that it is accessible for English speaking researchers because of the many well documented figures such as Leibniz, Newton and Samuel Pepys. In the course of his research he noted historiographic inconsistencies regarding characters of the period which he had to reconcile. Especially prominent was the deification of Newton, Locke and Boyle and their scientific method by Enlightenment and Victorian scholars. He considers the scientific work done during the Baroque period as crucial to the Enlightenment. From his research he concluded that the Enlightenment in general &quot;is and should be a controversial event because although it led to the flourishing of the sciences and political liberties and a lot of good stuff like that, one can also argue that it played a role in the French Revolution and some of the negative events of the time as well.&quot; The portrayal of a confusing and uncertain era develops throughout the book.

Some reviewers commented that Stephenson seems to carry his understanding of the period a little too far at times, delving into too much detail. Nick Hasted of &quot;The Independent&quot; wrote that this research made &quot;descriptions of Restoration London feel leaden, and intellectual discourses between Newton and his contemporaries textbook-dry.&quot; Despite the thorough examination of the period, however, Stephenson does take liberty in depicting the Enlightenment. Both main and secondary fictional characters become prominent members of society who advise the most important figures of the period and affect everything from politics to economics and science. For example, he repopulates the real Cabal Ministry with fictional characters.

==Style==
&quot;Quicksilver&quot; is a historical fiction novel that occasionally uses fantasy and science fiction techniques. The book is written in &quot;an omniscient modern presence occasionally given to wisecracks, with extensive use of the continuous present&quot;. Mark Sanderson of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and Steven Poole of &quot;The Guardian&quot; both describe the novel as in the picaresque genre, a genre common to 17th- and 18th-century Europe. Humor permeates the text, both situational and in the language itself, which emulates the picaresque style.

The narrative often presents protracted digressions. These digressions follow a multitude of events and subjects related to history, philosophy and scientific subjects. For example, USA Today commented on the length of discussion of Newton&#x27;s interest in the nature of gravity. With these digressions, the narrative also rapidly changes between multiple perspectives, first and third person, as well as using multiple writing techniques, both those familiar to the modern reader and those popular during the Early Modern period. These techniques include letters, drama, cryptographic messaging, genealogies and &quot;more interesting footnotes than found in many academic papers.&quot;

Stephenson incorporates 17th-century sentence structure and orthography throughout &quot;Quicksilver&quot;, most apparent in his use of italicization and capitalization. He adapts a combination of period and anachronistic language throughout the books, mostly to good effect, while allowing diction from modern usage, such as &quot;canal rage&quot; an allusion to road rage. Stephenson chose not to adapt period language for the entire text; instead he allowed such language to enter his writing when it was appropriate, often turning to modern English and modern labels for ideas familiar to modern readers. Stephenson said &quot;I never tried to entertain the illusion that I was going to write something that had no trace of the 20th or the 21st century in it.&quot;

==Plot==
===&quot;Quicksilver&quot;===
The first book is a series of flashbacks from 1713 to the earlier life of Daniel Waterhouse. It begins as Enoch Root arrives in Boston in October 1713 to deliver a letter to Daniel containing a summons from Princess Caroline. She wants Daniel to return to England and attempt to repair the feud between Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz. While following Daniel&#x27;s decision to return to England and board a Dutch ship (the &quot;Minerva&quot;) to cross the Atlantic, the book flashes back to when Enoch and Daniel each first met Newton. During the flashbacks, the book refocuses on Daniel&#x27;s life between 1661 and 1673.

While attending school at Trinity College, Cambridge, Daniel becomes Newton&#x27;s companion, ensuring that Newton does not harm his health and assisting in his experiments (including rebuffing a clumsy sexual advance from Newton, exactly as Daniel&#x27;s descendent Lawrence will rebuff Alan Turing in &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;). However, the plague of 1665 forces them apart: Newton returns to his family manor and Daniel to the outskirts of London. Daniel quickly tires of the radical Puritan rhetoric of his father, Drake Waterhouse, and decides to join Reverend John Wilkins and Robert Hooke at John Comstock&#x27;s Epsom estate.

There Daniel takes part in a number of experiments, including the exploration of the diminishing effects of gravity with changes in elevation, the transfusion of blood between dogs and Wilkins&#x27; attempts to create a philosophical language. Daniel soon becomes disgusted with some of the practices of the older natural philosophers (which include vivisection of animals) and visits Newton during his experiments with color and white light. They attempt to return to Cambridge, but again plague expels the students. Daniel returns to his father; however, his arrival on the outskirts of London coincides with the second day of the Fire of London. Drake, taken by religious fervour, dies atop his house as the King blows it up to create a fire break to prevent further spread of the fire. Soon after Drake&#x27;s death, Newton and Daniel return to Cambridge and begin lecturing.

A flashforward finds Daniel&#x27;s ship under attack by the fleet of Edward Teach (Blackbeard) in 1713. Then the story returns to the past as Daniel and Newton return to London: Newton is under the patronage of Louis Anglesey, the Earl of Upnor, and Daniel becomes secretary of the Royal Society when Henry Oldenburg is detained by the King for his active foreign correspondence. During his stint in London, Daniel encounters a number of important people from the period. Daniel remains one of the more prominent people in the Royal Society, close to Royal Society members involved in court life and politics. By 1672 both Daniel and Newton become fellows at Trinity College where they build an extensive alchemical laboratory which attracts other significant alchemists including John Locke and Robert Boyle. Daniel convinces Newton to present his work on calculus to the Royal Society.

In 1673, Daniel meets Leibniz in England and acts as his escort, leading him to meetings with important members of British society. Soon, Daniel gains the patronage of Roger Comstock as his architect. While under Roger&#x27;s patronage, the actress Tess becomes Daniel&#x27;s mistress both at court and in bed. Finally the book returns to 1713, where Daniel&#x27;s ship fends off several of Teach&#x27;s pirate ships. Soon they find out that Teach is after Daniel alone; however, with the application of trigonometry, the ship is able to escape the bay and the pirate band.

===The King of the Vagabonds===
&quot;The King of Vagabonds&quot; focuses on the travels of &quot;Half-Cocked&quot; Jack Shaftoe. It begins by recounting Jack&#x27;s childhood in the slums outside London where he pursued many disreputable jobs, including hanging from the legs of hanged men to speed their demise. The book then jumps to 1683, when Jack travels to the Battle of Vienna to participate in the European expulsion of the Turks. While attacking the camp, Jack encounters Eliza, a European slave in the sultan&#x27;s harem, about to be killed by janissaries. He kills the janissaries and loots the area, taking ostrich feathers and acquiring a Turkish warhorse which he calls Turk. The two depart from the camp of the victorious European army and travel through Bohemia into the Palatinate. To sell the ostrich feathers at a high price, they decide to wait until the spring fair in Leipzig. Jack and Eliza spend the winter near a cave warmed by a hot water spring. In the springtime, they travel to the fair dressed as a noblewoman and her bodyguard where they meet Doctor Leibniz. They quickly sell their goods with the help of Leibniz, and agree to accompany him to his silver mine in the Harz Mountains.

Once they arrive at the mine, Jack wanders into the local town where he has a brief encounter with Enoch Root in an apothecary&#x27;s shop. Jack leaves town but gets lost in the woods, encountering pagan worshippers and witch hunters. He successfully escapes them by finding safe passage through a mine connecting to Leibniz&#x27;s. Eliza and Jack move on to Amsterdam, where Eliza quickly becomes embroiled in the trade of commodities. Jack goes to Paris to sell the ostrich feathers and Turk, leaving Eliza behind. When he arrives in Paris, he meets and befriends St. George, a professional rat-killer and tamer, who helps him find lodging. While there, he becomes a messenger for bankers between Paris and Marseilles. However, during an attempt to sell Turk Jack is captured by nobles. Luckily, the presence of Jack&#x27;s former employer, John Churchill, ensures that he is not immediately killed. With Churchill&#x27;s help, Jack escapes from the barn where he has been held prisoner. During the escape, he rides Turk into a masquerade at the &quot;Hotel d&#x27;Arcachon&quot; in a costume similar to that of King Louis. With the aid of St. George&#x27;s rats he escapes without injury but destroys the ballroom and removes the hand of Etienne d&#x27;Arcachon.

Meanwhile, Eliza becomes heavily involved in the politics of Amsterdam, helping Knott Bolstrood and the Duke of Monmouth manipulate the trade of VOC stock. This causes a panic from which they profit. Afterwards, the French Ambassador in Amsterdam persuades Eliza to go to Versailles and supply him information about the French court. Eliza agrees after a brief encounter and falling-out with Jack. William of Orange learns of Eliza&#x27;s mission and intercepts her, forcing her to become a double agent for his benefit and to give him oral sex. Meanwhile, Jack, with an injury caused by Eliza, departs on the slaving trip. The ship is captured by Barbary pirates, and the end of the book has Jack as a captured galley-slave.

===Odalisque===
This book returns to Daniel Waterhouse, who in 1685, has become a courtier to Charles II because of his role as Secretary of the Royal Society. He warns James II, still Duke of York, of his brother Charles&#x27; impending death, following which, Daniel quickly becomes an advisor to James II. He continues to be deeply involved with the English court, ensuring the passage of several bills which reduce restrictions on non-conformists despite his detraction from the Francophile court. Meanwhile, Eliza becomes the governess of a widowers&#x27; two children in Versailles. She catches the eye of the king and becomes the broker of the French nobility. With her help, the French court, supported by King Louis, creates several market trends from which they profit extensively. Her active involvement in the French court gains her a title of nobility: Countess of Zeur.

Daniel and Eliza finally meet during a visit to the Netherlands where Daniel acts as an intermediary between William of Orange and the detracting English nobility. Daniel realizes Eliza&#x27;s importance during a meeting at the house of Christiaan Huygens. Eliza woos Daniel and uses this connection to gain entrance into the English court and the Royal Society. Daniel also meets Nicholas Fatio while in Amsterdam. Soon after this meeting, Fatio and Eliza prevent the attempted kidnapping of William of Orange by an ambitious French courtier. Upon his return, Daniel is arrested by the notorious judge George Jeffreys, and later imprisoned in the Tower of London. Daniel escapes with the help of Jack Shaftoe&#x27;s brother Bob, whose infantry unit is stationed there.

After a brief return to Versailles, Eliza joins Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate at her estate before the invasion of the Palatinate in her name. Eliza informs William of Orange of the troop movements caused by the French invasion which frees his forces along the border of the Spanish Netherlands, a region of stalemate between France and the Dutch Republic. During her flight from the Electorate of the Palatinate, Eliza becomes pregnant by Louis&#x27;s cryptographer, though popular knowledge suggested it was the French nobleman Etienne D&#x27;Arcachon&#x27;s child. Meanwhile, William takes the free troops from the border on the Spanish Netherlands to England, precipitating the Glorious Revolution, including the expulsion of James II. James flees London and Daniel Waterhouse soon encounters him in a bar. Convinced that the Stuart monarchy has collapsed, Daniel returns to London and takes revenge on Jeffreys by inciting a crowd to capture him for trial and later execution. Though he plans to depart for Massachusetts, Daniel&#x27;s case of bladder stones increasingly worsens during this period. The Royal Society and other family friends are very aware of this and force Daniel to get the stone removed by Robert Hooke at Bedlam.

==Major themes==
A 2003 interview in &quot;Newsweek&quot; quotes Stephenson&#x27;s belief that &quot;science fiction... is fiction in which ideas play an important part.&quot; Central to &quot;Quicksilver&quot; is the importance of the Enlightenment. By placing the reader among a world of ideas that change the course of science, Stephenson explores the development of the scientific method. One theme Stephenson explores in &quot;Quicksilver&quot; is the advancement of mathematical sciences which in turn led to important applications: Leibniz&#x27;s theory of binary mathematics became the foundation upon which to develop computers. As he did in &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;, Stephenson highlights the importance of networks and codes, which in &quot;Quicksilver&quot; occur against a &quot;backdrop of staggering diversity and detail&quot;, writes Mark Sanderson in his review of the book for the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;. Also, returning to his cyberpunk roots, Stephenson emphasizes the manner in which information and ideas are dispersed in complex societies. &quot;Quicksilver&quot; uses the &quot;interactions of philosophy, court intrigue, economics, wars, plagues and natural disasters&quot; of the late 17th and early 18th century to create a historical backdrop. From one perspective, the characters are most useful in their roles as &quot;carriers of information&quot;. Although the characters use various techniques to disseminate information, the most prominent is cryptography. Elizabeth Weisse writes in &quot;USA Today&quot; that the use of cryptography is &quot;Stephenson&#x27;s literary calling card&quot;, as she compares &quot;Quicksilver&quot; to &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;.

In &quot;Quicksilver&quot; Stephenson presents the importance of freedom of thought, the diversity required for new ideas to develop, and the manner in which new ideas are expressed. To explore or accept an idea such as the theory of gravity often resulted in dire consequences or even &quot;grotesque punishment&quot; in the early 17th century. Stephenson also points out that research, particularly as conducted at the Royal Society, resulted in a changing of views in some cases:
If you read the records of the Royal Society and what they were doing in the 1660s, it&#x27;s clear that at a certain point, some of these people – and I think Hooke was one of them – became a little bit disgusted with themselves and began excusing themselves when one of these vivisections was going to happen. I certainly don&#x27;t think they turned into hardcore animal rights campaigners, or anything close to that, but I think after a while, they got a little bit sick of it and started to feel conflicted about what they were doing. So I&#x27;ve tried to show that ambivalence and complication in the book.

How to exist during a &quot;time of dualities&quot; is another important theme in &quot;Quicksilver&quot;, especially in their effects on Daniel Waterhouse, who is torn between &quot;reason versus faith, freedom versus destiny, matter versus math.&quot;

Frequent mention of alchemy indicates the shift from an earlier age to a newer transformative age. Newton was an alchemist, and one character compares finance to alchemy: &quot;all goods—silk, coins, shares in mines—lose their hard dull gross forms and liquefy, and give up their true nature, as ores in an alchemist&#x27;s furnace sweat mercury&quot;. The book focuses on a period of social and scientific transmutations, expanding upon the symbolism of the book&#x27;s title, &quot;Quicksilver&quot;, because it is a period in which the &quot;principles governing transformation&quot; are investigated and established. A commerce of different goods rapidly changing from one into another is a recurrent theme throughout the book. Also, the title &quot;Quicksilver&quot; connects the book to the method alchemists used to distill quicksilver, &quot;the pure living essence of God&#x27;s power and presence in the world&quot;, from, as one character put it, &quot;the base, dark, cold, essentially fecal matter of which the world was made.&quot;

==Characters==
===Main characters===
In order of appearance:
*Enoch Root – an elusive and mysterious alchemist who first appears at the beginning of the book and recurs throughout often in the company of Alchemists such as Newton and Locke.
*Daniel Waterhouse – son of prominent Puritan Drake Waterhouse, roommate of Isaac Newton, friend of Gottfried Leibniz, and prominent member of the Royal Society. Waterhouse is both a savant and a strict Puritan. As &quot;Quicksilver&quot; progresses he becomes more and more involved in the inner workings of British politics.
*&quot;Half-Cocked&quot; Jack Shaftoe – an English vagabond, known as &quot;The King of the Vagabonds&quot;, who rescues Eliza and becomes the enemy of the Duke d&#x27;Arcachon.

==Critical reception==
The reception to &quot;Quicksilver&quot; was generally positive. Some reviewers found the length cumbersome; however, others found the length impressive in its quality and entertainment value. Paul Boutin at &quot;Slate Magazine&quot; comments that &quot;Quicksilver&quot; offers an insight into how advanced and complicated science was during the age of &quot;alchemists and microscope-makers&quot;; and that the scientists of the period were &quot;the forerunners of the biotech and nanotech researchers who are today&#x27;s IT Geeks&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; rates &quot;Quicksilver&quot; an A−, stating that the book &quot;makes you ponder concepts and theories you initially thought you&#x27;ll never understand&quot;. The critic finds a parallel between Stephenson&#x27;s approach and a passage from the book describing an effort to put &quot;all human knowledge ... in a vast Encyclopedia that will be a sort of machine, not only for finding old knowledge but for making new&quot;.

&quot;The Independent&quot; places emphasis on the comparisons between the story that evolves in &quot;Quicksilver&quot; and Stephenson&#x27;s earlier novel &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;, with the former &quot;shaping up to be a far more impressive literary endeavour than most so-called &#x27;serious&#x27; fiction. And it ends on a hell of a cliffhanger. No scholarly, and intellectually provocative, historical novel has been this much fun since &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot;&quot;. Patrick Ness considers &quot;Quicksilver&quot; to be &quot;entertaining over an impossible distance. This isn&#x27;t a book; it&#x27;s a place to move into and raise a family.&quot; His review focuses on the scope of the material and humour inherent in &quot;Quicksilver&quot;. Mark Sanderson calls the novel an &quot;astonishing achievement&quot;, and compares &quot;Quicksilver&quot; to &quot;Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s &quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot; and Lawrence Norfolk&#x27;s &quot;Lempriere&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;.&quot; Although full of historical description and incredibly lengthy, &quot;Quicksilver&quot; is noticeably full of what Sanderson called &quot;more sex and violence ... than any Tarantino movie&quot;. Stephenson balances his desire to respect the period with a need to develop a novel which entertains modern readers.
In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Steven Poole commented that &quot;&#x27;Quicksilver&quot; was: &quot;&quot;

Polly Shulman of &quot;The New York Times&quot; finds &quot;Quicksilver&quot; hard to follow and amazingly complex but a good read. However she notes that the complicated and clunky dialogue between the characters is a distraction. She thinks a full appreciation of the work is only possible within the context of the remaining novels of &quot;The Baroque Cycle&quot;, and compares the novel to works by Dorothy Dunnett, William Gibson and Bruce Sterling, calling it &quot;history-of-science fiction&quot;. In the post-publication review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Edward Rothstein remarks that the scope of the novel is at times detrimental: &quot;Unfortunately, in this novelistic cauldron it can sometimes seem as if mercury&#x27;s vapors had overtaken the author himself, as if every detail he had learned had to be anxiously crammed into his text, while still leaving the boundaries between fact and invention ambiguous&quot;. He considers the novel to be an &quot;experiment in progress&quot;, although the historical background is compelling.

Deborah Friedell disliked &quot;Quicksilver&quot;. She mentions Stephenson&#x27;s poor writing and his lack of knowledge of the literary tradition, which she considers to be because &quot;the greatest influences upon Stephenson&#x27;s work have been comic books and cartoons&quot;. She dislikes his use of anachronism, his failure to be literary and his general approach to historical fiction. She writes of Stephenson and the reviewers who reviewed the work in a positive manner:
Stephenson is decidedly not a prodigy; but his babe-in-the-woods routine has proved irresistible for some, who are hailing his seemingly innate ability to meld the products of exhaustive historical research with what they see as a brilliant, idiosyncratic sense of humor and adventure. &quot;Time&quot;″s critic has declared that Stephenson has a &quot;once-in-a-generation gift&quot;, and that &quot;Quicksilver&quot; &quot;will defy any category, genre, precedent or label—except for genius&quot;. This is promotional copy disguised as literary criticism. There is nothing category-defying about this ridiculous book.

From the foreign press, the review in the &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine&quot; points out the historical period of &quot;Quicksilver&quot; is one of the birth of science which corresponds with a period of language shift as English became the language of science. Moreover, the review focuses on Leibniz&#x27;s principles of mathematics which Stephenson claims established the framework for modern computing.

==Publication history==
Based on the success of &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;, a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller with sales of about 300,000 copies, the initial print-run for &quot;Quicksilver&quot; was 250,000 copies. Five months before the release date, a web campaign was initiated to advertise the work. The novel was originally published in a single volume; in 2006 HarperCollins republished the books in three separate paperback volumes.

<text>Harmonic and Individual Lines and Noise (HILN) is a parametric codec for audio. The basic premise of the encoder is that most audio, and particularly speech, can be synthesized from only sinusoids and noise. The encoder describes individual sinusoids with amplitude and frequency, harmonic tones by fundamental frequency, amplitude and the spectral envelope of the partials, and the noise by amplitude and spectral envelope. This type of encoder is capable of encoding audio to between 6 and 16 kilobits per second for a typical audio bandwidth of 8 kHz. The framelength of this encoder is 32 ms.

A typical codec extracts sinusoid information from the samples by applying a short-time Fourier transform to the samples and using that to find the important harmonic content of a single frame. By matching sinusoids across frames, the encoder is capable of grouping them into harmonic lines and individual sinusoids. The matching can take amplitude, frequency and phase into account when trying to match sinusoids across frames. Differences between amplitude and frequency within a track can be coded with fewer bits than each individual single sinusoid would require, thus the longer a track the encoder can find, the better it will be able to reduce the final bitrate.

The decoder uses an add-and-overlap strategy: each frame in the bitstream contains parameters for 32 ms, however, the next frame starts halfway through the current frame. By filtering the synthesized segments with a Hanning filter, adding two overlapping frames together will produce a smooth transition between the two. This also applies to the encoder because the short Fourier transform gives better results when the data is pre-processed with a Hanning filter.

Synthesizing only the sinusoids sounds artificial and metallic. To mask this, the encoder subtracts the synthesized sinusoids from the original audio signal. The residual is then matched to a linear filter that is excited with white noise. The extracted parameters can then be quantized, coded and multiplexed into a bitstream.</text><links>

<doc id="327127" wikidata="Q202631" url="?curid=327127" title="John Archibald Wheeler">
<text>John Archibald Wheeler (July 9, 1911April 13, 2008) was an American theoretical physicist. He was largely responsible for reviving interest in general relativity in the United States after World War II. Wheeler also worked with Niels Bohr to explain the basic principles of nuclear fission. Together with Gregory Breit, Wheeler developed the concept of the Breit–Wheeler process. He is best known for popularizing the term &quot;black hole&quot; for objects with gravitational collapse already predicted during the early 20th century, for inventing the terms &quot;quantum foam&quot;, &quot;neutron moderator&quot;, &quot;wormhole&quot; and &quot;it from bit&quot;, and for hypothesizing the &quot;one-electron universe&quot;. Stephen Hawking called Wheeler the &quot;hero of the black hole story&quot;.

At 21, Wheeler earned his doctorate at Johns Hopkins University under the supervision of Karl Herzfeld. He studied under Breit and Bohr on a National Research Council fellowship. In 1939 he collaborated with Bohr on a series of papers using the liquid drop model to explain the mechanism of fission. During World War II, he worked with the Manhattan Project&#x27;s Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago, where he helped design nuclear reactors, and then at the Hanford Site in Richland, Washington, where he helped DuPont build them. He returned to Princeton after the war but returned to government service to help design and build the hydrogen bomb in the early 1950s. He and Edward Teller were the main civilian proponents of thermonuclear weapons.

For most of his career, Wheeler was a professor of physics at Princeton University, which he joined in 1938, remaining until 1976. At Princeton he supervised 46 PhD students, more than any other physics professor.

Wheeler left Princeton at the age of 65. He was appointed director of the Center for Theoretical Physics at the University of Texas at Austin in 1976 and remained in the position until 1986, when he retired and became a professor emeritus.

== Early life and education ==
Wheeler was born in Jacksonville, Florida, on July 9, 1911, to librarians Joseph L. Wheeler and Mabel Archibald (Archie) Wheeler. He was the oldest of four children. His brother Joseph earned a PhD from Brown University and a Master of Library Science from Columbia University. His brother Robert earned a PhD in geology from Harvard University and worked as a geologist for oil companies and several colleges. His sister Mary studied library science at the University of Denver and became a librarian. They grew up in Youngstown, Ohio, but spent a year in 1921 to 1922 on a farm in Benson, Vermont, where Wheeler attended a one-room school. When they returned to Youngstown he attended Rayen High School.

After graduating from Baltimore City College high school in 1926, Wheeler entered Johns Hopkins University with a scholarship from the state of Maryland. He published his first scientific paper in 1930, as part of a summer job at the National Bureau of Standards. He earned his doctorate in 1933. His dissertation research work, carried out under the supervision of Karl Herzfeld, was on the &quot;Theory of the Dispersion and Absorption of Helium&quot;. He received a National Research Council fellowship, which he used to study under Gregory Breit at New York University in 1933 and 1934, and then in Copenhagen under Niels Bohr in 1934 and 1935. In a 1934 paper, Breit and Wheeler introduced the Breit–Wheeler process, a mechanism by which photons can be potentially transformed into matter in the form of electron–positron pairs.

== Early career ==
The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill made Wheeler an associate professor in 1937, but he wanted to be able to work more closely with experts in particle physics. He turned down an offer in 1938 of an associate professorship at Johns Hopkins University in favor of an assistant professorship at Princeton University. Although it was a lesser position, he felt that Princeton, which was building up its physics department, was a better career choice. He remained a member of its faculty until 1976.

In his 1937 paper &quot;On the Mathematical Description of Light Nuclei by the Method of Resonating Group Structure&quot;, Wheeler introduced the S-matrix—short for scattering matrix—&quot;a unitary matrix of coefficients connecting the asymptotic behavior of an arbitrary particular solution [of the integral equations] with that of solutions of a standard form&quot;. Wheeler did not pursue this idea, but in the 1940s Werner Heisenberg developed the idea of the S-matrix into an important tool in elementary particle physics.

In 1938 Wheeler joined Edward Teller in examining Bohr&#x27;s liquid drop model of the atomic nucleus; they presented their results at a meeting of the American Physical Society in New York. Wheeler&#x27;s Chapel Hill graduate student Katharine Way also presented a paper, which she followed up in a subsequent article, detailing how the liquid drop model was unstable under certain conditions. Due to a limitation of the liquid drop model, they all missed the opportunity to predict nuclear fission. In 1939, Bohr brought the news of Lise Meitner&#x27;s and Otto Frisch&#x27;s discovery of fission to America. Bohr told Leon Rosenfeld, who informed Wheeler.

Bohr and Wheeler set to work applying the liquid drop model to explain the mechanism of nuclear fission. As the experimental physicists studied fission, they uncovered puzzling results. George Placzek asked Bohr why uranium seemed to fission with both very fast and very slow neutrons. Walking to a meeting with Wheeler, Bohr had an insight that fission at low energies was due to the uranium-235 isotope, while at high energies it was mainly due to the far more abundant uranium-238 isotope. They co-wrote two more papers on fission. Their first paper appeared in &quot;Physical Review&quot; on September 1, 1939, the day Germany invaded Poland, starting World War II.

Considering the notion that positrons were electrons traveling backward in time, in 1940 Wheeler conceived his one-electron universe postulate: that there was in fact only one electron, bouncing back and forth in time. His graduate student Richard Feynman found this hard to believe, but the idea that positrons were electrons traveling backward in time intrigued him, and Feynman incorporated the notion of the reversibility of time in his Feynman diagrams.

== Nuclear weapons ==
=== Manhattan Project ===
Soon after the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor brought the U.S. into World War II, Wheeler accepted a request from Arthur Compton to join the Manhattan Project&#x27;s Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago. He moved there in January 1942, joining Eugene Wigner&#x27;s group, which was studying nuclear reactor design. He co-wrote a paper with Robert F. Christy on &quot;Chain Reaction of Pure Fissionable Materials in Solution&quot;, which was important in the plutonium purification process. It was declassified in December 1955. He gave the neutron moderator its name, replacing Enrico Fermi&#x27;s term, &quot;slower downer&quot;.
After the United States Army Corps of Engineers took over the Manhattan Project, it gave DuPont responsibility for the detailed design and construction of the reactors. Wheeler became part of DuPont&#x27;s design staff. He worked closely with its engineers, commuting between Chicago and Wilmington, Delaware, where DuPont had its headquarters. He moved his family to Wilmington in March 1943. DuPont&#x27;s task was to build not just nuclear reactors, but an entire plutonium production complex at the Hanford Site in Washington. As work progressed, Wheeler relocated his family again in July 1944, to Richland, Washington, where he worked in the scientific buildings known as the 300 area.

Even before the Hanford Site started up the B Reactor, the first of its three reactors, on September 15, 1944, Wheeler had been concerned that some nuclear fission products might be nuclear poisons, the accumulation of which would impede the ongoing nuclear chain reaction by absorbing many of the thermal neutrons needed to continue a chain reaction. In an April 1942 report, he predicted that this would reduce the reactivity by less than one percent so long as no fission product had a neutron capture cross section of more than 100,000 barns. After the reactor unexpectedly shut down, and then just as unexpectedly restarted about 15 hours later, he suspected iodine-135, with a half life of 6.6 hours, and its daughter product, xenon-135, which has a half life of 9.2 hours. Xenon-135 turned out to have a neutron capture cross-section of well over two million barns. The problem was corrected by adding additional fuel slugs to burn out the poison.

Wheeler had a personal reason for working on the Manhattan Project. His brother Joe, fighting in Italy, sent him a postcard with a simple message: &quot;Hurry up&quot;. It was already too late: Joe was killed in October 1944. &quot;Here we were&quot;, Wheeler later wrote, &quot;so close to creating a nuclear weapon to end the war. I couldn&#x27;t stop thinking then, and haven&#x27;t stopped thinking since, that the war could have been over in October 1944.&quot; Joe left a widow and baby daughter, Mary Jo, who later married physicist James Hartle.

=== Hydrogen bomb ===
In August 1945 Wheeler and his family returned to Princeton, where he resumed his academic career. Working with Feynman, he explored the possibility of physics with particles, but not fields, and carried out theoretical studies of the muon with Jayme Tiomno, resulting in a series of papers on the topic, including a 1949 paper in which Tiomno and Wheeler introduced the &quot;Tiomno Triangle&quot;, which related different forms of radioactive decay. He also suggested the use of muons as a nuclear probe. This paper, written and privately circulated in 1949 but not published until 1953, resulted in a series of measurements of the Chang radiation emitted by muons. Muons are a component of cosmic rays, and Wheeler became the founder and first director of Princeton&#x27;s Cosmic Rays Laboratory, which received a grant of $375,000 from the Office of Naval Research in 1948. Wheeler received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1946, which allowed him to spend the 1949–50 academic year in Paris.
The 1949 detonation of Joe-1 by the Soviet Union prompted an all-out effort by the United States, led by Teller, to develop the more powerful hydrogen bomb in response. Henry D. Smyth, Wheeler&#x27;s department head at Princeton, asked him to join the effort. Most physicists were, like Wheeler, trying to reestablish careers interrupted by the war and reluctant to face more disruption. Others had moral objections. Those who agreed to participate included Emil Konopinski, Marshall Rosenbluth, Lothar Nordheim, and Charles Critchfield, but there was also now a body of experienced weapons physicists at the Los Alamos Laboratory, led by Norris Bradbury. Wheeler agreed to go to Los Alamos after a conversation with Bohr. Two of his graduate students from Princeton, Ken Ford and John Toll, joined him there.

At Los Alamos, Wheeler and his family moved into the house on &quot;Bathtub Row&quot; that Robert Oppenheimer and his family had occupied during the war. In 1950 there was no practical design for a hydrogen bomb. Calculations by Stanisław Ulam and others showed that Teller&#x27;s &quot;Classical Super&quot; would not work. Teller and Wheeler created a new design known as &quot;Alarm Clock&quot;, but it was not a true thermonuclear weapon. Not until January 1951 did Ulam come up with a workable design.

In 1951 Wheeler obtained Bradbury&#x27;s permission to set up a branch office of the Los Alamos laboratory at Princeton, known as Project Matterhorn, which had two parts. Matterhorn S (for stellarator, another name coined by Wheeler), under Lyman Spitzer, investigated nuclear fusion as a power source. Matterhorn B (for bomb), under Wheeler, did nuclear weapons research. Senior scientists remained uninterested and aloof from the project, so he staffed it with young graduate and postdoctoral students. Matterhorn B&#x27;s efforts were crowned by the success of the Ivy Mike nuclear test at Enewetak Atoll in the Pacific, on November 1, 1952, which Wheeler witnessed. The yield of the Ivy Mike &quot;Sausage&quot; device was reckoned at , about 30 percent higher than Matterhorn B had estimated. 

In January 1953 Wheeler was involved in a security breach when he lost a highly classified paper on lithium-6 and the hydrogen bomb design during an overnight train trip. This resulted in an official reprimand.

Matterhorn B was discontinued, but Matterhorn S endures as the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory.

== Later academic career ==
After concluding his Matterhorn Project work, Wheeler resumed his academic career. In a 1955 paper, he theoretically investigated the geon, an electromagnetic or gravitational wave held together in a confined region by the attraction of its own field. He coined the name as a contraction of &quot;gravitational electromagnetic entity&quot;. He found that the smallest geon was a toroid the size of the Sun, but millions of times heavier. He later showed that geons are unstable, and would quickly self destruct if they were ever to form.

===Geometrodynamics===
During the 1950s, Wheeler formulated geometrodynamics, a program of physical and ontological reduction of every physical phenomenon, such as gravitation and electromagnetism, to the geometrical properties of a curved space-time. His research on the subject was published in 1957 and 1961. Wheeler envisaged the fabric of the universe as a chaotic subatomic realm of quantum fluctuations, which he called &quot;quantum foam&quot;.

===General relativity===
General relativity had been considered a less respectable field of physics, being detached from experiment. Wheeler was a key figure in its revival, leading the school at Princeton, while Dennis William Sciama and Yakov Borisovich Zel&#x27;dovich developed the subject at Cambridge University and the University of Moscow, respectively. Wheeler and his students made substantial contributions to the field during the Golden Age of General Relativity.

While working on mathematical extensions to Einstein&#x27;s general relativity in 1957, Wheeler introduced the concept and word &quot;wormhole&quot; to describe hypothetical &quot;tunnels&quot; in space-time. Bohr asked whether they were stable and further research by Wheeler determined that they are not. His work in general relativity included the theory of gravitational collapse. He used the term &quot;black hole&quot; in 1967 during a talk he gave at the NASA Goddard Institute of Space Studies (GISS), although the term had been used earlier in the decade. Wheeler said the term was suggested to him during a lecture when a member of the audience was tired of hearing Wheeler say &quot;gravitationally completely collapsed object&quot;. Wheeler was also a pioneer in the field of quantum gravity due to his development, with Bryce DeWitt, of the Wheeler–DeWitt equation in 1967. Stephen Hawking later described Wheeler and DeWitt&#x27;s work as the equation governing the &quot;wave function of the Universe&quot;.

=== Quantum information ===
Wheeler left Princeton in 1976 at age 65. He was appointed director of the Center for Theoretical Physics at the University of Texas at Austin in 1976 and remained in the position until 1986, when he retired and became a professor emeritus. Misner, Thorne and Wojciech Zurek, all former students of Wheeler, wrote:
Wheeler&#x27;s delayed-choice experiment describes a family of thought experiments in quantum physics that he proposed, with the most prominent of them appearing in 1978 and 1984. These experiments seek to discover whether light somehow &quot;senses&quot; the experimental apparatus that it travels through in the double-slit experiment, adjusting its behavior to fit by assuming an appropriate determinate state, or whether it remains in an indeterminate state, neither wave nor particle, and responds to the &quot;questions&quot; the experimental arrangements ask of it in either a wave-consistent manner or a particle-consistent manner.

===Teaching===
Wheeler&#x27;s graduate students included Jacob Bekenstein, Hugh Everett, Richard Feynman, David Hill, Bei-Lok Hu, John R. Klauder, Charles Misner, Kip Thorne, William Unruh, Robert M. Wald, Katharine Way, and Arthur Wightman. Wheeler gave teaching high priority, and continued to teach freshman and sophomore physics, saying that young minds were the most important. At Princeton he supervised 46 PhDs, more than any other physics professor. Wheeler wrote a supportive review article to help Hugh Everett&#x27;s work, wrote to and met with Niels Bohr in Copenhagen seeking his approval of Everett&#x27;s approach, and continued to advocate for Everett even after Bohr&#x27;s rejection. 
With Kent Harrison, Kip Thorne, and Masami Wakano, Wheeler wrote &quot;Gravitation Theory and Gravitational Collapse&quot; (1965). This led to the voluminous general relativity textbook &quot;Gravitation&quot; (1973), co-written with Misner and Thorne. Its timely appearance during the golden age of general relativity and its comprehensiveness made it an influential relativity textbook for a generation. Wheeler and Edwin F. Taylor wrote &quot;Spacetime Physics&quot; (1966) and &quot;Scouting Black Holes&quot; (1996).

Alluding to Wheeler&#x27;s &quot;mass without mass&quot;, the festschrift honoring his 60th birthday was titled &quot;Magic Without Magic: John Archibald Wheeler: A Collection of Essays in Honor of his Sixtieth Birthday&quot; (1972). His writing style could also attract parodies, including one by &quot;John Archibald Wyler&quot; that was affectionately published by a relativity journal.

=== Participatory Anthropic Principle ===
Wheeler speculated that reality is created by observers in the universe. &quot;How does something arise from nothing?&quot;, he asked about the existence of space and time. He also coined the term &quot;Participatory Anthropic Principle&quot; (PAP), a version of a Strong Anthropic Principle.

In 1990, Wheeler suggested that information is fundamental to the physics of the universe. According to this &quot;it from bit&quot; doctrine, all things physical are information-theoretic in origin:
In developing the Participatory Anthropic Principle, an interpretation of quantum mechanics, Wheeler used a variant on Twenty Questions, called Negative Twenty Questions, to show how the questions we choose to ask about the universe may dictate the answers we get. In this variant, the respondent does not choose or decide upon any particular or definite object beforehand, but only on a pattern of &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; answers. This variant requires the respondent to provide a consistent set of answers to successive questions, so that each answer can be viewed as logically compatible with all the previous ones. In this way, successive questions narrow the options until the questioner settles upon a definite object. Wheeler&#x27;s theory was that, in an analogous manner, consciousness may play some role in bringing the universe into existence.

From a transcript of a radio interview on &quot;The Anthropic Universe&quot;:

===Opposition to parapsychology===
In 1979, Wheeler spoke to the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), asking it to expel parapsychology, which had been admitted ten years earlier at Margaret Mead&#x27;s request. He called it a pseudoscience, saying he did not oppose earnest research into the questions, but thought the &quot;air of legitimacy&quot; of being an AAAS affiliate should be reserved until convincing tests of at least a few so-called psi effects could be demonstrated. In the question-and-answer period following his presentation &quot;Not consciousness, but the distinction between the probe and the probed, as central to the elemental quantum act of observation&quot;, Wheeler incorrectly said that J. B. Rhine had committed fraud as a student, for which he apologized in a subsequent letter to the journal &quot;Science&quot;. His request was turned down and the Parapsychological Association remained a member of the AAAS.

== Personal life ==
For 72 years, Wheeler was married to Janette Hegner, a teacher and social worker. They became engaged on their third date, but agreed to defer marriage until he returned from Europe. They were married on June 10, 1935, five days after his return. Employment was difficult to find during the Great Depression. Arthur Ruark offered Wheeler a position as an assistant professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, at an annual salary of $2,300, which was less than the $2,400 Janette was offered to teach at the Rye Country Day School. They had three children.

Wheeler and Hegner were founding members of the Unitarian Church of Princeton, and she initiated the Friends of the Princeton Public Library. In their later years, Hegner accompanied him on sabbaticals in France, Los Alamos, New Mexico, the Netherlands, and Japan. Hegner died in October 2007 at the age of 96.

== Death and legacy ==
Wheeler won numerous prizes and awards, including the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1966, the Enrico Fermi Award in 1968, the Franklin Medal in 1969, the Einstein Prize in 1969, the National Medal of Science in 1971, the Niels Bohr International Gold Medal in 1982, the Oersted Medal in 1983, the J. Robert Oppenheimer Memorial Prize in 1984, and the Wolf Foundation Prize in 1997. He was a member of the American Philosophical Society, the Royal Academy, the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, and the Century Association. He received honorary degrees from 18 different institutions. In 2001, Princeton used a $3 million gift to establish the John Archibald Wheeler/Battelle Professorship in Physics. After his death, the University of Texas named the John A. Wheeler Lecture Hall in his honor.

On April 13, 2008, Wheeler died of pneumonia at the age of 96 in Hightstown, New Jersey.

<text>The National Speleological Society (NSS) is an organization formed in 1941 to advance the exploration, conservation, study, and understanding of caves in the United States. Originally headquartered in Washington D.C., its current offices are in Huntsville, Alabama. The organization engages in the research and scientific study, restoration, exploration, and protection of caves. It has more than 10,000 members in more than 250 grottos.

Since 1974 there has been a cave diving section of the society.

==History==
The Speleological Society of the District of Columbia (SSDC) was formed on May 6, 1939 by Bill Stephenson. In the fall of 1940, the officers of the SSDC drafted a proposed constitution that would transform the SSDC into the National Speleological Society. On January 24, 1941, Stephenson sent a letter to all members of the SSDC announcing that &quot;on January 1 the Society was reorganized as a national organization.&quot; The New England Grotto was the first NSS Grotto. It was chartered in 1941 with Clay Perry as president and Ned Anderson as vice president.

On February 6, 1974, a pioneering cave diver named Sheck Exley became the first chairman of the Cave Diving Section of the National Speleological Society. The new section began with 21 members in 10 different states.

==Publications==
The NSS produces a number of publications, including:
*NSS News, monthly
* Journal of Cave and Karst Studies (quarterly), formerly NSS Bulletin (from 1940 to 1995).
*Membership Manual, yearly
*American Caving Accidents, every few years
The NSS&#x27;s list of long and deep caves was kept until 2022 by surveyor and cartographer Robert Gulden.

== Organization ==

The organization is currently divided into 11 regions:

*Arizona Regional Association (ARA)
*Mid-Appalachian Region (MAR)
*Mississippi Valley-Ozark Region (MVOR)
*Northeastern Regional Organization (NRO)
*Northwest Caving Association (NCA)
*Rocky Mountain Region
*Southeastern Regional Association (SERA)
*Southwestern Region (SWR)
*Texas Speleological Association (TSA)
*Virginia Region (VAR)
*Western Region

Within these regions are local chapters known as grottos. The grottos carry out the local-level recreational and conservation-related business of the NSS. They generally function as the local NSS chapter/club. Many Grottos however operate in areas outside of their local area, with many operating in several states. Most Grottos also participate in Regions that are loose associations of Grottos. Regions are also an internal organization of the National Speleological Society.

Grottos are required to meet certain organizational requirements as outlined by the National Speleological Society. These include:
* A constitution and bylaws that are submitted to, and approved by, the NSS.
* A minimum of at least five members of the Society.
* It is NSS policy that full membership in a Grotto requires NSS membership. However, in practice, this is often not the case.

==Convention==
The NSS hosts a yearly convention, which is generally held in June. Grottos take turns hosting the convention.
==Awards==
The Society makes a series of awards, presented during its annual convention:

* William J. Stephenson Award for outstanding service
* Honorary member award
* Lew Bicking award
* Victor A. Schmidt conservation award
* Science award
* Spelean arts and letters award
* Certificate of merit
* Fellow of the society
* Peter M. Hauer spelean history award
* James G. Mitchell award
* NCA best paper on a show cave award
* Certificate of appreciation

<text>The Gyeongbu line (&quot;Gyeongbuseon&quot;) is a railway line in South Korea and is considered to be the most important and one of the oldest in the country. It was constructed in 1905, connecting Seoul with Busan via Suwon, Daejeon, and Daegu. It is by far the most heavily travelled rail line in South Korea.

All types of high-speed, express, local, and freight trains provide frequent service along its entire length.

==History==

In 1894–1895, the Empire of Japan and Qing China fought the First Sino-Japanese War for influence over Korea. Following the war, Japan competed with the Russian Empire&#x27;s railway expansion in Northeast Asia, which led it to seek the right from the Korean Empire to build a railway from Busan to Keijō. This railway line was intended by Japan to solidify its strategic positions against Russia, which it would later go to war. Surveying began in 1896, and in spite of local protests, the Korean Empire gave Japan the right to build the line in 1898. Construction of the railway started on August 20, 1901, with a ceremony at Eitōho-ku, Keijō. Construction was supervised by Japanese, with local Koreans commandeered into forced labor and paid with coupons.

Japan also sought to gain control of the Keigi Railway project that was to continue tracks further north, recognizing the trunk route as a means to keep Korea under its influence. After the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War, Japan ignored Korea&#x27;s declaration of neutrality and transported troops to Incheon. Japan also forced the Korean government to sign an agreement that ceded its control of the railway. Japanese military bases were established in connection with the railway, the biggest of them next to Ryūzan Station in Keijō.

The Gyeongbu line was publicly inaugurated on January 1, 1905 as the . The first trains travelled the line in 17 hours 4 minutes. By April 1906, travel time was reduced to 11 hours, while top speed was . The line developed into the backbone of transport in Korea under Japanese rule. Following the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, from April 1, 1933, the line was traversed by direct trains from Busan to Andong (today Dandong) across the border. From December 1, 1936, the &quot;Akatsuki&quot; luxury express trains ran on the line with a maximum speed of , and achieved the shortest pre-war travel time of 6 hours 30 minutes in the timetable valid from November 1, 1940.

Travel times increased greatly while the line was used for transport in World War II. Following World War II, the Seoul–Busan express train re-established on May 20, 1946, was named &quot;Chosun Liberator&quot;. During the Korean War, the line transported troops and refugees. The line remained the backbone of transport in South Korea after the war, when diesel locomotives and the cross-country Mugunghwa-ho train class was introduced. Following the 1961 coup, the Supreme Council for National Reconstruction started South Korea&#x27;s first five-year plan, which included a construction program to complete the railway network, to foster economic growth. On the Gyeongbu Line, the effort was advertised with a new class of express trains named &quot;Jaegeon-ho&quot;, (Reconstruction train) introduced on May 15, 1962. These trains reduced travel times below the best pre-WWII travel times for the first time, connecting Seoul and Busan in 6 hours 10 minutes at a top speed of .

From the 1960s, road construction began to make road transport more attractive and faster. Although top speed rose to and the Seoul–Busan travel time along the Gyeongbu Line was reduced to 4 hours 50 minutes by June 10, 1969, on the parallel Gyeongbu Expressway, completed in 1970, travel time was only 4 hours to 4 hours 30 minutes. Korean National Railroad responded by introducing the Saemaul-ho class of elevated-comfort express trains on August 15, 1974. with the introduction of new streamlined diesel locomotives and then diesel multiple units in Saemaul-ho service, top speed was raised to and travel time was reduced to 4 hours 10 minutes with the timetable valid from November 16, 1985.

==Upgrade==

The Gyeongbu Line was extensively upgraded in parallel with the development of the Seoul Metropolitan Subway urban rapid transit system and the Korea Train Express (KTX) high-speed rail system from the 1970s.

The Gyeongbu Line is six-tracked from Seoul to Guro, four-tracked from Guro to Cheonan, and double-tracked from Cheonan all the way to Busan. The entire line is electrified.

===Relationship with the KTX project===

The Seoul–Busan axis is Korea&#x27;s main traffic corridor. In 1995, it housed 73.3% of Korea&#x27;s population, and conducted 70% of the freight traffic and 66% of the passenger traffic. With both the Gyeongbu Expressway and Korail&#x27;s Gyeongbu Line congested, the government saw the need to develop railways. The first proposals for a second Seoul-Busan railway line originated from a study prepared between 1972 and 1974 by experts of France&#x27;s SNCF and Japan Railway Technical Service (JARTS) on a request from the IBRD. A more detailed 1978-1981 study by KAIST, focusing on the needs of freight transport, also came to the conclusion that the necessary capacity for freight transport on the existing Gyeongbu Line could best be released by separating off long-distance passenger traffic on a parallel high speed passenger railway, which was then taken up in Korea&#x27;s next Five Year Plan.

Following the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, the government decided to finish the Gyeongbu High Speed Railway (Gyeongbu HSR) in two phases, and upgrade and electrify the conventional Gyeongbu Line for KTX services on the sections paralleling the parts of the high-speed line not completed in the first phase.

Plans foresaw the development of the Gyeongbu Line into a high-capacity freight corridor after the completion of the second phase of the Gyeongbu HSR. At the time of the opening of the Daegu–Busan section of the high-speed line on November 1, 2010, capacity available for freight trains on the conventional line was expected to increase by a factor of 7.7, while the capacity for passenger transport in the entire corridor increased by a factor of 3.4.

===Electrification===

The line was electrified in stages from 1974 to 2006:

For KTX trains and new electric locomotives, top speed was also raised to up to 150 km/h.

==Services==

The Gyeongbu Line is the major route out of Seoul and Yongsan stations and, in addition to regular departures for Busan, trains travel along the Gyeongbu Line en route to Janghang, Gwangju, Mokpo, Suncheon, Yeosu, Pohang, Ulsan, Haeundae, Masan, and Jinju. Trains for Jecheon, Andong, and Yeongju also operate along sections of the Gyeongbu Line.

On the section between Seoul Station, Guro (where roughly half of the trains leave the Gyeongbu Line to head out to Incheon via the Gyeongin Line), Suwon, and Byeongjeom, Seoul Subway Line 1 provides frequent commuter services.

The Gyeongbu Line is served along its entire length by frequent intercity Saemaul-ho and cross-country Mugunghwa-ho trains. Some trains run along the entire length of the line, others only on some sections, including trains diverging to the connected lines. As of October 2010, direct Saemaul day trains connect Seoul to Busan in a minimum 4 hours 50 minutes, and Mughungwa trains in a minimum 5 hours 28 minutes.

===KTX===

Korail launched KTX high-speed services with the opening of the first phase of the Gyeongbu HSR on April 1, 2004. The Seoul–Busan travel distance was shortened to 408.5 km, the shortest travel time was 2 hours 40 minutes.

All KTX services use the conventional Gyeongbu Line between Seoul and the start of the Siheung Interconnection at a junction after Geumcheon-gu Office station, until the Siheung Interconnection diverges in a tunnel towards the present start of the Gyeongbu HSR. The terminal for most Gyeongbu KTX services is Seoul Station, for most Honam KTX services, Yongsan station. In addition, some trains continue beyond Seoul Station for 14.9 km along the Gyeongui Line to terminate at Haengsin station, next to which KTX trains have a depot. An additional stop at Yeongdeungpo station was proposed in 2004, however, the plans were dropped in face of opposition from locals living around Gwangmyeong station along the Gyeongbu HSR, who feared that Yeongdeungpo would draw away passengers from the new station and force its closing. However, the November 1, 2010, timetable change made Yeongdeungpo a KTX stop, for newly introduced trains that also use the Gyeongbu Line on the entire Seoul–Daejeon section, to serve Suwon.

From its opening, the Gyeongbu KTX service also returned to the Gyeongbu Line for two short sections crossing Daejeon and Daegu, where local disputes about the high-speed line alignment across urban areas held up construction; and all the way from Daegu to Busan. Consequently, all but two of the stations of the Gyeongbu KTX service were on the conventional Gyeongbu Line: after the two stations on the high-speed line, Gwangmyeong and Cheonan-Asan, stops were at Daejeon, Dongdaegu (East Daegu), Miryang, Gupo and Busan. Some Gyeongbu KTX services maintained service on this relation after the November 1, 2010, opening of the second phase of the Gyeongbu HSR, with the daily number of halts in Miryang and Gupo increased. Korail met local demands by introducing additional KTX services between Seoul and Dongdaegu in June 2007, which used the conventional Gyeongbu Line between Daejeon and Dongdaegu to serve Gimcheon and Gumi. However, these services were discontinued with the opening of the Gimcheon–Gumi station on the high-speed line.

The section between Daegu and Samnangjin, the junction with the Gyeongjeon Line, is also used by the Gyeongjeon KTX services, which connect Seoul to Masan on the Gyeongjeon Line since December 15, 2010, and will be extended to Jinju by 2012. Stops along the Gyeongbu Line will be at Dongdaegu and Miryang.

===Evolution of long-distance passenger traffic===

Between Seoul and Cheonan, the Mugunghwa and Saemaul express trains on the Gyeongbu Line gave rail around a fifth of the modal share before the launch of KTX services. Due to the short distance and the location of the KTX station outside the city, the conventional line could retain most of its passengers, and the increase in the total modal share of rail was modest. On the medium-distance relation from Seoul to Daejeon, KTX gained market share mostly at the expense of normal express services on the Gyeongbu Line, which decreased by half in the first year, while the total share of rail increased to a third. On the long-distance relations from Seoul to Daegu and Busan, the total share of rail increased from around two-fifths to a market dominating three-fifths, with the bulk of that traffic taken by the KTX. For intercity passenger traffic on the conventional Gyeongbu Line, that translates to a sharp drop on the Daejeon-Daegu section (bypassed by KTX trains) and a sharp increase on the Daegu-Busan section.

<text>The [[Gyeongbu]] Expressway (; Asian Highway Network ) is the second oldest and most heavily travelled expressway in South Korea, connecting Seoul to Suwon, Daejeon, Gumi, Daegu, Gyeongju, Ulsan and Busan. It has the route number 1, signifying its role as South Korea&#x27;s most important expressway. The entire length from Seoul to Busan is and the posted speed limit is , enforced primarily by speed cameras.

== History ==
Inspired by the Autobahn during a trip to Germany, South Korean President Park Chung Hee proposed the construction of the Gyeongbu Expressway as an election pledge in 1967.
* February 1968 - Construction begins at the behest of South Korean President Park Chung Hee, who named Park Myung-keun in charge of construction.
* 21 December 1968 - Seoul-Suwon segment opens to traffic.
* 30 December 1968 - Suwon-Osan segment opens to traffic.
* 29 September 1969 - Anseong-Cheonan segment opens to traffic.
* 10 December 1969 - Cheonan-Daejeon segment opens to traffic.
* 19 December 1969 - Busan-Daegu (via Gyeongju) segment opens to traffic.
* 7 July 1970 - The last segment, the mountainous Daejeon-Daegu segment, opens to traffic, completing South Korea&#x27;s first long-distance limited access expressway.
* December 1987 - Work begins to widen to six lanes in selected areas. Some areas are widened to 8 or 10 lanes by 1996.
* February 1995 - Bus-only lane (essentially an HOV-9) established between the northern terminus and Sintanjin for important holidays.
* 14 July 2000 - Eight vehicles, including three buses and a five-ton truck, collide near Gimcheon, killing 18 and injuring over 100.
* 25 August 2001 - All expressways in South Korea reorganize under a pattern modeled after the United States&#x27; Interstate Highway System. The Gyeongbu Expressway&#x27;s route number of 1 is the only one not to change; however, its kilometer markers change from a north–south progression to south–north.
* December 2002 - Korea National Expressway Corporation passes control of the northernmost 9 km stretch of expressway (between Yangjae and Hannam Bridge) to the City of Seoul.
* 1 July 2008 - Bus lane enforcement between Seoul and Osan (Sintanjin on weekends) becomes daily between 6 AM and 10 PM. On 1 October this is adjusted to 7 AM to 9 PM weekdays, 9 AM to 9 PM weekends.

<text>Archie Shepp (born May 24, 1937) is an American jazz saxophonist, educator and playwright who since the 1960s has played a central part in the development of avant-garde jazz.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Shepp was born in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, but raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He began playing banjo with his father, then studied piano and saxophone while attending high school in Germantown. He studied drama at Goddard College from 1955 to 1959.

He played in a Latin jazz band for a short time before joining the band of avant-garde pianist Cecil Taylor. Shepp&#x27;s first recording under his own name, &quot;Archie Shepp - Bill Dixon Quartet&quot;, was released on Savoy Records in 1962 and featured a composition by Ornette Coleman. In 1962, he performed with Dixon at the 8th World Festival of Youth and Students in Helsinki, Finland. Along with alto saxophonist John Tchicai and trumpeter Don Cherry, he formed the New York Contemporary Five. John Coltrane&#x27;s admiration for Shepp led to recordings for Impulse! Records, the first of which was &quot;Four for Trane&quot; in 1964, an album of mainly Coltrane compositions on which he was joined by Tchicai, trombonist Roswell Rudd, trumpeter Alan Shorter, bassist Reggie Workman and drummer Charles Moffett.

===Early career===
Shepp participated in the sessions for Coltrane&#x27;s &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; in late 1964, but none of the takes he participated in were included on the final LP release (they were made available for the first time on a 2002 reissue). However, Shepp, along with Tchicai and others from the &quot;Four for Trane&quot; sessions, then recorded &quot;Ascension&quot; with Coltrane in 1965, and his place alongside Coltrane at the forefront of the avant-garde jazz scene was epitomized when the pair split a record (the first side a Coltrane set, the second a Shepp set) entitled &quot;New Thing at Newport&quot; released in late 1965.
In 1965, Shepp released &quot;Fire Music&quot;, which included the first signs of his developing political consciousness and his increasingly Afrocentric orientation. The album took its title from a ceremonial African music tradition and included a reading of an elegy for Malcolm X. Shepp&#x27;s 1967 &quot;The Magic of Ju-Ju&quot; also took its name from African musical traditions, and the music was strongly rooted in African music, featuring an African percussion ensemble. At this time, many African-American jazzmen were increasingly influenced by various continental African cultural and musical traditions; along with Pharoah Sanders, Shepp was at the forefront of this movement. &quot;The Magic of Ju-Ju&quot; defined Shepp&#x27;s sound for the next few years: freeform avant-garde saxophone lines coupled with rhythms and cultural concepts from Africa.

Shepp was invited to perform in Algiers for the 1969 Pan-African Cultural Festival of the Organization for African Unity, along with Dave Burrell, Sunny Murray, and Clifford Thornton. This ensemble then recorded several sessions in Paris at the BYG Actuel studios.

Shepp continued to experiment into the new decade, at various times including harmonica players and spoken word poets in his ensembles. With 1972&#x27;s &quot;Attica Blues&quot; and &quot;The Cry of My People&quot;, he spoke out for civil rights; the former album was a response to the Attica Prison riots. Shepp also writes for theater; his works include &quot;The Communist&quot; (1965) and &quot;Lady Day: A Musical Tragedy&quot; (1972). Both were produced by Robert Kalfin at the Chelsea Theater Center.

In the late 1960s, Shepp began his teaching career as a professor of African-American Studies at SUNY in Buffalo, New York. In 1971, Shepp was recruited to the University of Massachusetts Amherst by Randolph Bromery, beginning a 30-year career as a professor of music. Shepp&#x27;s first two courses were entitled &quot;Revolutionary Concepts in African-American Music&quot; and &quot;Black Musician in the Theater&quot;.
In the late 1970s and beyond, Shepp&#x27;s career went between various old territories and various new ones. He continued to explore African music, while also recording blues, ballads, spirituals (on the 1977 album &quot;Goin&#x27; Home&quot; with Horace Parlan) and tributes to more traditional jazz figures such as Charlie Parker and Sidney Bechet, while at other times dabbling in R&amp;B, and recording with various European artists including Jasper van&#x27;t Hof, Tchangodei and Dresch Mihály.

===Later career===

Shepp is featured in the 1981 documentary film &quot;Imagine the Sound&quot;, in which he discusses and performs his music and poetry. Shepp also appears in &quot;Mystery, Mr. Ra&quot;, a 1984 French documentary about Sun Ra. The film also includes footage of Shepp playing with Sun Ra&#x27;s Arkestra.

Since the early 1990s, he has often played with the French trumpeter Eric Le Lann. In 1993, he worked with Michel Herr to create the original score for the film &quot;Just Friends&quot;.

In 2002, Shepp appeared on the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s tribute album to Fela Kuti, &quot;Red Hot and Riot&quot;. Shepp appeared on a track entitled &quot;No Agreement&quot; alongside Res, Tony Allen, Ray Lema, Baaba Maal, and Positive Black Soul. In 2004 Archie Shepp founded his own record label, Archieball, together with Monette Berthomier. The label is located in Paris, France, and includes collaborations with Jacques Coursil, Monica Passos, Bernard Lubat, and Frank Cassenti.

<doc id="327146" wikidata="Q1209245" url="?curid=327146" title="King Xiao of Zhou">
<text>King Xiao of Zhou (), personal name Ji Bifang, was a king of the Chinese Zhou dynasty. Estimated dates of his reign are 891–886 BC or 872–866 BC. 
He was a son of King Mu and brother of King Gong.

His reign is poorly documented. He was preceded on the throne by his nephew King Yì of Zhou and followed by his nephew&#x27;s son, King Yí of Zhou. Sima Qian wrote that the King Yí was &quot;restored by the many lords&quot;. This hints at a usurpation, but the matter is not clear.

Feizi was granted a small fief at Qin by King Xiao. King Xiao learned of his reputation and put him in charge of breeding and training horses for the Zhou army. To reward his contributions, King Xiao wanted to make Feizi his father&#x27;s legal heir instead of his half-brother Cheng.

<text>The Gyeongin Line (Gyeonginseon) is a railway mainline in South Korea, currently connecting Guro station in Seoul and Incheon. Commuter services along the line through operates into Seoul Subway Line 1.

==History==

The Gyeongin Line was the first railway line built on the Korean peninsula. It was opened by the Keijin Railway Company between Noryangjin, on the shore of the Han River across from Seoul, Geumchon, in Incheon, on September 18, 1899. Soon after, the line was extended across the Han River into Seoul Station, and beyond Geumchon to the port of Incheon. When the construction of the Gyeongbu Line was completed from Busan to Guro on January 1, 1905, the Seoul-Guro section of the Gyeongin Line became part of the Gyeongbu Line. The remaining Gyeongin Line from Guro to Incheon is long.

Following the 1961 coup, the Supreme Council for National Reconstruction started South Korea&#x27;s first five-year plan, which included a construction program to complete the railway network, to foster economic growth. As part of the program, from November 1963, two additional tracks were laid to the north of the existing tracks from Yeongdeungpo station on the Gyeongbu Line to Dongincheon station. The of new tracks, also called Gyeonginbuk Line, entered service on September 18, 1965.

The line was among the first in South Korea to be electrified with the 25 kV/60 Hz AC catenary system, when two tracks over the between Seoul and Incheon entered service on August 15, 1974, for the Seoul Subway Line 1. Electrification of the second two tracks started with the from Guro to Bupyeong, which went into service on January 29, 1999. The until Juan followed on March 15, 2002, and the final on December 21, 2005.

==Operation==
Korail operated regular passenger service along the Gyeongin Line until the electrification of the line in the early 1970s, when passenger service was integrated into Seoul Subway Line 1. Line 1 trains using the Gyeongin Line provide up to ten trains an hour per direction, with services towards Guro, Cheongnyangni, Dongmyo, Seongbuk, Chang-dong, Uijeongbu, Yangju, Dongducheon and Soyosan.

<text>:&quot;George Macartney should not be confused with Sir George Macartney, a later British statesman.&quot;
George Macartney, 1st Earl Macartney, (14 May 1737 – 31 May 1806) was a British diplomat, politician and colonial administrator who served as the governor of Grenada, Madras and the Cape Colony. He is often remembered for his observation following Britain&#x27;s victory in the Seven Years&#x27; War and subsequent territorial expansion at the Treaty of Paris that Britain now controlled &quot;a vast Empire, on which the sun never sets&quot;.

==Early years==
He was born in 1737 as the only son of George Macartney, High Sheriff of Antrim and Elizabeth Winder. Macartney descended from a Scottish family with origins in Ireland, who were granted land in Scotland for serving under Edward Bruce, brother of Robert the Bruce. The Macartneys of Auchenleck, Kirkcudbrightshire settled in Lissanoure County Antrim, Ireland, where he was born.

After graduating from Trinity College Dublin, in 1759, he became a student of the Temple, London. Through Stephen Fox, elder brother of Charles James Fox, he was taken up by Lord Holland.

Appointed envoy extraordinary to Russia in 1764, he succeeded in negotiating an alliance between Great Britain and Russia with Catherine II. In 1768, he returned to the Irish House of Commons as a Member of Parliament for Armagh Borough, in order to discharge the duties of Chief Secretary for Ireland. On resigning this office, he was knighted.

In 1775, he became governor of the British West Indies and was created Baron Macartney in the Peerage of Ireland in 1776. He was elected to a seat in the British parliament (Bere Alston) from 1780 to 1781.

== Grenada ==

Macartney was the governor of Grenada from 1776 to 1779. During his governance, the island was attacked in July 1779, by the French royal fleet of the Comte d&#x27;Estaing.

After losing control of the fortifications on Hospital Hill 
— an essential defence position located on a prominence overlooking the island capital St. George&#x27;s—Macartney chose to surrender unconditionally and was taken prisoner to France.

== Madras ==

Macartney was the governor of Madras (now known as Chennai) from 1781 to 1785. During his tenure as governor, renovation and strengthening of the walls of Fort St. George was commenced after the siege by Thomas Lally, and completed in 1783. It was also during this time that most of the buildings and barracks in the western portion of the Fort were erected. The Palace Street, the Arsenal, the Hanover square and the Western Barracks were constructed during this time. The streets on the eastern side of the Fort were also altered.

It was also during this time that idea of a police force for Madras was thought of. Stephen Popham, another British resident and the developer of Pophams Broadway, submitted a plan to Macartney for the establishment of a regular police force for Madras and for the building of direct and cross drains in every street. Popham also advocated measures for the naming and lighting of streets, for the regular registration of births and deaths and for the licensing of liquor, arrack and toddy shops. A Board of Police assisted by a Kotwal was subsequently formed. The Kotwal was to be the officer of the markets under the Superintendent of Police.

He negotiated the Treaty of Mangalore which brought an end to the Second Anglo-Mysore War in 1784. Macartney declined the governor-generalship of India—then the British territories administered by the British East India Company—and returned to Britain in 1786.

== Ambassador to China ==

After being created Earl Macartney in the Irish peerage in 1792, he was appointed the first envoy of Britain to Qing China, after the failure of a number of previous embassies, including Cathcart&#x27;s. He led the Macartney Embassy to Beijing in 1792, with a large British delegation on board a 64-gun man-of-war, under the command of Captain Sir Erasmus Gower. The embassy was ultimately not successful in its primary aim to open trade with China, although numerous secondary purposes were attained, including a first-hand assessment of the strength of the Chinese empire.

The failure to obtain trade concessions was not due to Macartney&#x27;s refusal to kowtow in the presence of the Qianlong Emperor, as is commonly believed. It is more likely that the Chinese hegemony of east Asian states meant that China was used to having other states come and offer vassalage. In comparison, the European states were used to the order that came out of the Peace of Westphalia. Under that order, all states were formally treated as equals. For this reason, Macartney was negotiating as an equal in the European style, while the Qianlong Emperor was used to conducting diplomacy under Chinese hegemony.

After the conclusion of the embassy, the Qianlong Emperor sent a letter to King George III, explaining in greater depth the reasons for his refusal to grant the requests of the embassy. The Macartney Embassy is historically significant because it marked a missed opportunity by the Chinese to move toward some kind of accommodation with the West. This failure would continue to plague China as it encountered increasing foreign pressures and internal unrest during the 19th century.

The policies of the Thirteen Factories remained. The embassy returned to Britain in 1794 without obtaining any concession from China. However, the mission could be construed as a success because it brought back detailed observations. Sir George Staunton was charged with producing the official account of the expedition after their return. This multi-volume work was taken chiefly from the papers of Lord Macartney and from the papers of Sir Erasmus Gower, who was Commander of the expedition. Gower also left a more personal record through his private letters to Admiral John Elliot and Captain Sir Henry Martin, 1st Baronet (Comptroller of the Navy). Joseph Banks, the President of the Royal Society, was responsible for selecting and arranging engraving of the illustrations in this official record.

Macartney was expected to lead an embassy to Japan after he completed his mission to China, but his hopes of being able to proceed to Japan were ended by the confirmation when he returned to Canton of news of the outbreak of war with France and consequently of the vulnerability of his ships to attack by French cruisers operating from Batavia. On 23 December, Macartney recorded in his journal: &quot;I have given up my projected visit to Japan, which (though now less alluring in prospect) has always been with me a favourite adventure as a possible opening of a new mine for the exercise of our industry and the purchase of our manufactures&quot;.

==Later life==
On his return from a confidential mission to Italy in 1795, he was raised to the British peerage as Baron Macartney, of Parkhurst in the County of Surrey and Auchinleck in the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright, and at the end of 1796 was appointed governor of the newly acquired territory of the Cape Colony, where he remained until ill health compelled him to resign in November 1798.

In early 1797, he was requested to assist with the proposed plan to send an attacking force from the Cape under Major-General J. H. Craig to the South West coast of Spanish America by way of the British colony in New South Wales.

He died at Chiswick, Middlesex, on 31 May 1806, the title becoming extinct. After the death of his widow (Lady Jane Stuart, daughter of the 3rd Earl of Bute; they were married in 1768), his property passed to his niece, whose son took the name.

<text>Jonas Hellborg (born 7 June 1958) is a Swedish bass guitarist. He has collaborated with John McLaughlin, Ustad Sultan Khan, Fazal Qureshi, Bill Laswell, Shawn Lane, Jens Johansson, Anders Johansson, Ginger Baker, Michael Shrieve, V. Selvaganesh, Jeff Sipe, Mattias IA Eklundh, Public Image Ltd, and Buckethead.

==Recording career==
Hellborg began his music career in 1976 in Sweden touring with local rock acts. He was spotted by percussionist Reebop Kwaku Baah in a small club in Stockholm 1979 and he moved to London for a year to work with Reebop on different projects. He played the Montreux Jazz festival in Switzerland in 1981 and met Michael Brecker, who introduced him to John McLaughlin, Billy Cobham and other fusion stars. He was asked to join McLaughlin&#x27;s reformed Mahavishnu Orchestra in 1983. He stayed with McLaughlin until 1988, touring and recording with Mahavishnu Orchestra. He also did several duet tours with McLaughlin during this time.

In 1986 and 1987 he toured with a project featuring Ginger Baker on drums and Bernie Worrell on keyboards, which appears on Hellborg&#x27;s 1988 album &quot;Bass&quot;. They continued to perform together in 1989.

In 1988 Hellborg moved to New York and started his own band which first included keyboardist Aydin Esen and drummer Kenwood Dennard, and later the Johansson Brothers, Jens on keyboards and Anders on drums. He started a recording studio together with producer/bassist Bill Laswell called Greenpoint Studios. They recorded a multitude of records there until early 1993, including &quot;The Word&quot; together with Tony Williams, &quot;Octave of the Holy Innocents&quot; with Mike Shrieve and Buckethead, &quot;Material&#x27;s Hallucination Engine&quot;, and &quot;E&quot; with the Johansson Brothers.

In 1993 he sold his part in the studio to Laswell and resettled in Paris, France. The following year he teamed up with guitarist Shawn Lane, a cooperation that would last nine years. The first record was &quot;Abstract Logic&quot; with Ginger Baker&#x27;s son Kofi on drums; this was followed by Michael Shrieve&#x27;s &quot;Two Doors&quot;. By the third record they were joined by drummer Jeff Sipe and embarked on a long stretch that produced four records and a lot of touring between 1995 and 1997.

In 1998 Hellborg met percussionist V. Selvaganesh at a Zakir Hussain concert in Paris. The two formed a musical partnership that has been ongoing since then. To start with, Selvaganesh joined Hellborg in duets and in different &quot;classical&quot; settings Hellborg was working on at the time. Later a group was formed, first in trio with Lane, then a quintet including Selvaganesh&#x27;s two brothers V. Umashankar and V. Umamahesh. Two CDs and a DVD were produced with this group. After Shawn Lane&#x27;s death in 2003, Hellborg has continued to explore amalgamations of Indian and Western music, working with Indian masters as Debashish Bhattacharya, Niladri Kumar, Vikku Vinayakram, Tanmoy Bose and U. Shrinivas. He has also started a new metal-fusion project with guitarist Mattias IA Eklundh called Art Metal.

Hellborg founded his own record label, Day Eight Music (D.E.M.), in 1979, releasing his first solo bass record, &quot;The Bassic Thing&quot; – an early showcase of his pioneering chordal, and for the time very advanced, slapping approaches. It was the first LP ever to feature solely bass guitar. With the move to the US, a new entity was formed, called Bardo Music, that took over the responsibilities of Hellborg&#x27;s output, now counting around 40 releases.

==Musical equipment==

Hellborg has been involved in instrument design from early in his career. His work includes a signature model for Aria, the first ever biamped bass amplifier (in cooperation with Italian company FBT), a double neck bass, fretted and fretless, for British company Wal in 1983, and, in 1984, an acoustic bass in collaboration with master luthier Abraham Wechter.

After working with a half dozen other companies with signature models and inventions he, together with the German manufacturer Warwick, created a new bass and a high end line of bass amplification.

Hellborg published two books in the early &#x27;80s with Music Sales of London, one on slap bass called &quot;Thumb Bassics&quot;, and a chord book called &quot;Chord Bassics&quot;.

==Acting==
As a teenager Hellborg appeared as an actor in the TV series &quot;Hem till byn&quot; (&quot;Home to the Village&quot;), a widely popular dramatic series inspired by everyday life in Sweden, in which Jonas&#x27;s mother, actress Tove Waltenburg, played one of the main characters. He appeared in the first three seasons, in 1971, 1973 and 1976, as well as in one episode in season four (in 1990), where his character has become a famous bass player. According to IMDb, playing Anders Persson in &quot;Hem till Byn&quot; is his only acting credit.

<text>Discos Taxco was a mid 20th century record label specializing in Mexican music. The label was mostly marketed in Mexico, but was manufactured in Los Angeles, California, in the United States of America. It was owned by William Castillo. It was one of the few record labels in the United States catering to Chicanos following the Second World War which achieved more than local distribution.

<doc id="327155" wikidata="Q282657" url="?curid=327155" title="Samuel Gompers">
<text>Samuel Gompers (; January 27, 1850December 11, 1924) was a British-born American cigar maker, labor union leader and a key figure in American labor history. Gompers founded the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and served as the organization&#x27;s president from 1886 to 1894, and from 1895 until his death in 1924. He promoted harmony among the different craft unions that comprised the AFL, trying to minimize jurisdictional battles. He promoted thorough organization and collective bargaining in order to secure shorter hours and higher wages, which he considered the essential first steps to emancipating labor.

He was against the AFL member unions to take political action to &quot;elect their friends&quot; and &quot;defeat their enemies&quot;. In politics he mostly supported Democrats, and occasionally local Republicans. He led the opposition to immigration from China. During World War I, Gompers and the AFL energetically supported the war effort, attempting to avert strikes and boost morale while raising wage rates and expanding membership. He strongly opposed the antiwar labor groups, especially the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW).

==Early life==
Gompers was born Samuel Gumpertz on January 27, 1850, in Spitalfields, a working-class area in the East End of London into a Jewish family that originally hailed from Amsterdam. He was the son of Sarah (Root) and Solomon Gumpertz, a cigar maker. At age six, Samuel was sent to the Jewish Free School to receive a basic education. His education there was brief, however, and a mere three months after his tenth birthday Gompers was sent to work as an apprentice cigar maker and earn money for his impoverished family.

Gompers continued his studies in night school, learning Hebrew and studying the Talmud—a process that he later likened to studying law. While he appreciated Hebrew in his youth, he held Yiddish in low regard.

==Young worker at the bench==
Owing to dire financial straits, the Gompers family immigrated to the United States in 1863, settling in the Lower East Side of Manhattan in New York City. Gompers&#x27;s father manufactured cigars at home, assisted for the first year and half by Samuel. In his free time, the young teenager formed a debate club with his friends, gaining practical experience in public speaking and parliamentary procedure. The club drew Gompers into contact with other upwardly mobile young men of the city, including young Irish-American Peter J. McGuire, who would later play a large role in the AFL.

In 1864, at age 14, Gompers joined the Cigar Makers Local Union No. 15, the English-speaking union of cigar makers in New York City. Gompers later recounted his days as a cigar maker at the bench in detail, emphasizing the place of craftsmanship in the production process:

The day after his seventeenth birthday he married his co-worker, sixteen-year-old Sophia Julian. Together they had many children, but only six survived infancy.

In 1873, Gompers moved to the cigar maker David Hirsch &amp; Company, a &quot;high-class shop where only the most skilled workmen were employed&quot;. Gompers later called this change of employers &quot;one of the most important changes in my life&quot;, for at Hirsch&#x27;s—a union shop operated by an émigré German socialist—Gompers came into contact with an array of German-speaking cigar makers—&quot;men of keener mentality and wider thought than any I had met before&quot;, he recalled. Gompers learned German and absorbed many of the ideas of his shop mates, developing a particular admiration for the ideas of the former secretary of the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association, Karl Laurrell. Laurrell took Gompers under his wing, challenging his more simplistic ideas and urging Gompers to put his faith in the organized economic movement of trade unionism rather than the socialist political movement.

Gompers later recalled:

Gompers complained that the socialist movement had been captured by Lassallean advocates of &quot;political party action&quot; rather than the &quot;militant economic program of Marx&quot;. He warned delegates to the 1900 annual convention that when men became enthusiastic about socialism, &quot;they usually lost interest in their union&quot;.

==Cigar Makers&#x27; International Union career==

Gompers was elected president of Cigar Makers&#x27; International Union Local 144 in 1875.

As was the case with other unions of the day, the Cigar Maker&#x27;s Union nearly collapsed in the financial crisis of 1873–77, in which unemployment skyrocketed and ready availability of desperate workers willing to labor for subsistence wages put pressure upon the gains in wages and the shortening of hours achieved in union shops. Gompers and his friend Adolph Strasser used Local 144 as a base to rebuild the Cigar Makers&#x27; Union, introducing a high dues structure and implementing programs to pay out-of-work benefits, sick benefits, and death benefits for union members in good standing.

Gompers told the workers they needed to organize because wage reductions were almost a daily occurrence. He believed that the capitalists were only interested in profits, &quot;and the time has come when we must assert our rights as workingmen. Every one present has the sad experience, that we are powerless in an isolated condition, while the capitalists are united; therefore, it is the duty of every Cigar Maker to join the organization&quot;. &quot;One of the main objects of the organization&quot;, he concluded, &quot;is the elevation of the lowest paid worker to the standard of the highest, and in time we may secure for every person in the trade an existence worthy of human beings.&quot;

He was elected second vice president of the Cigar Makers&#x27; International Union in 1886 when he was 36 and first vice president in 1896. Despite the commitment of time and energy entailed by his place as head of the American Federation of Labor, Gompers remained first vice president of the Cigar Makers until his death in December 1924.

==Leading the AFL==

Gompers helped found the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions in 1881 as a coalition of like-minded unions. In 1886 it reorganized into the American Federation of Labor, with Gompers as president. With the exception of the year 1895, he would remain president of the organization until his death. In 1894 he became editor of the Federation&#x27;s publication, &quot;The American Federationist&quot;.

Under Gompers&#x27;s tutelage, the AFL coalition gradually gained strength, undermining the position previously held by the Knights of Labor, which as a result, had almost vanished by 1900. He was nearly jailed in 1911 for publishing, with John Mitchell, a boycott list, but in 1914 the Supreme Court overturned the sentence in &quot;Gompers v. Buck&#x27;s Stove and Range Co.&quot;.

===Immigration and foreign affairs===
Gompers, who had ties with the Cuban cigar workers in the U.S., called for American intervention in Cuba; he supported the resulting war with Spain in 1898. After the war, however, he joined the Anti-Imperialist League to oppose President William McKinley&#x27;s plan to annex the Philippines. Mandel (1963) argues that his anti-imperialism was based on opportunistic fears of threats to labor&#x27;s status from low-paid offshore workers and was founded on a sense of racial superiority to the peoples of the Philippines.

By the 1890s, Gompers was planning an international federation of labor, starting with the expansion of AFL affiliates in Canada, especially Ontario. He helped the Canadian Trades and Labour Congress with money and organizers, and by 1902, the AFL dominated the Canadian union movement.

Gompers, like most labor leaders, opposed unrestricted immigration from Europe because of the fear that it might lower wages of domestic union workers. He strongly opposed all immigration from Asia because it lowered wages and, in his judgement, represented an alien culture that could not be assimilated easily into that of the U.S. Gompers bragged that the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions (FOTLU), later renamed the American Federation of Labor (AFL), &quot;was the first national organization which demanded the exclusion of coolies from the United States&quot;. He and the AFL strongly supported the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 that banned the immigration of Chinese, and published a pamphlet entitled &quot;Some reasons for Chinese exclusion. Meat vs. Rice. American Manhood against Asiatic Coolieism. Which shall survive?&quot; in 1901. The AFL was instrumental in passing immigration restriction laws from the 1890s to the 1920s, such as the 1921 Emergency Quota Act and the Immigration Act of 1924 signed into law by President Calvin Coolidge. At least one study concludes that the link between the AFL and the Democratic Party rested in large part on immigration issues, as the owners of large corporations wanted more immigration for cheaper labor and thus supported the Republican Party. Other scholars have seriously questioned this conclusion, arguing it oversimplifies the politics and unity of labor leaders and the major parties. As one reviewer argued in &quot;The Journal of American History&quot;, major Republican leaders, such as President William McKinley and Senator Mark Hanna, made pro-labor statements, many unions supported their own independent labor parties (or the Socialist Party), and unity within the AFL was never so extensive as claimed.

During World War I Gompers was a strong supporter of the war effort. He was appointed by President Wilson to the Council of National Defense, where he chaired the Labor Advisory Board. He was also elected president of the American Alliance for Labor and Democracy, which was organized to suppress anti-war propaganda among workers. He attended the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 as an official advisor on labor issues. He was appointed chairman of the Commission on International Labour Legislation, whose recommendations for a workers&#x27; rights charter were incorporated into the Treaty of Versailles.

===Post-war leadership===
In addition to his work with the Commission on International Labour Legislation, Gompers was chairman of the US labor delegates at the International Federation of Trade Unions initial conference in Amsterdam, in July, 1919.

Despite his support for the war, he later supported amnesty for political prisoners who were convicted under Wartime Emergency Acts. He worked with Lucy Robins Lang, who became the executive secretary of the amnesty committee. Lang and Gompers also became friends.

===Philosophy===

During a severe period of national economic recession in the early 1890s, labor unrest was at its height. A volatile situation in Chicago in August 1893 caused the city&#x27;s then mayor, Carter Harrison III, to warn that the preponderance of the unemployed would lead to riots that would &quot;shake the country&quot;, unless Congress interceded. In late August 1893, Gompers addressed 25,000 unemployed workers who had massed on the shore of Lake Michigan. As reported in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; on August 31, Gompers inveighed against the controllers of capital and the titans of industry and finance. &quot;Why should the wealth of the country be stored in banks and elevators while the idle workman wanders homeless about the streets and the idle loafers who hoard the gold only to spend it on riotous living are rolling about in fine carriages from which they look out on peaceful meetings and call them riots?&quot; Workers were also consumers, he asserted, and cuts to their wages would hurt not only their personal well-being but the economy as a whole. &quot;When workers&#x27; wages are reduced, they necessarily use less, consume less, because of their reduced purchasing power&quot;, he wrote. &quot;Only those who ignorantly or grabbingly believe in their avarice that business can prosper with wage reductions have yet to learn the lesson of industrial life and progress.&quot;

Gompers began his labor career familiar with, and sympathetic to, Georgism and the precepts of socialism, but gradually adopted a more conservative approach to labor relations. Labor Historian Melvyn Dubofsky has written, &quot;By 1896 Gompers and the AFL were moving to make their peace with Capitalism and the American system ... Although the AFL had once preached the inevitability of class conflict and the need to abolish &#x27;wage slavery&#x27;, it slowly and almost imperceptibly began to proclaim the virtues of class harmony and the possibilities of a more benevolent Capitalism.&quot; For example, Alex Heron attributes the following quote to Gompers: &quot;The greatest crime an employer can perpetrate on his employees is to fail to operate at a profit&quot;. Gompers began to take a neutral stance in politics after the failure of the efforts to elect Henry George as mayor of New York, but Gompers remained a Single Tax Georgist later in life.

Gompers’ philosophy of labor unions centered on economic ends for workers, such as higher wages, shorter hours, and safe working conditions so that they could enjoy an &quot;American&quot; standard of living—a decent home, decent food and clothing, and money enough to educate their children. He thought economic organization was the most direct way to achieve these improvements, but he did encourage union members to participate in politics and to vote with their economic interests in mind.

Gompers’ trade union philosophy and his devotion to collective bargaining with business proved to be too conservative for more radical leaders, such as Ed Boyce, president of the Western Federation of Miners (WFM), and, later, WFM secretary-treasurer Bill Haywood. In 1905, Haywood and the WFM helped to establish the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), whose members were known as Wobblies, with the goal of organizing the entire working class. The IWW&#x27;s long-term goal was to supplant capitalism with a workers&#x27; commonwealth. Nonetheless, when government abuses against the leaders of the WFM seemed too egregious, Gompers relented and offered assistance.

Gompers and his AFL unions vigorously fought the IWW in the U.S. and in Latin America, viewing them as a disruptive dual union that tried harder to destroy capitalism than to help workers. He cooperated with widespread government arrests of union leaders for the IWW&#x27;s militant opposition to the World War. He said, &quot;the IWW&#x27;s ... are exactly what the Bolsheviki are in Russia, and we have seen what the IWW Bolsheviki in Russia have done for the working people.&quot;

Gompers led the anti-Socialist faction inside the AFL, losing to Socialists only once, in 1894. He argued that socialists believed workers and unions could never co-exist with business interests and wanted to use the labor unions to advance their more radical political causes. By 1920 Gompers had largely marginalized Socialist influence to a few unions, notably coal miners and the needle trades.

===Freemason===

Gompers was a leading Freemason, reaching the 32º in the Scottish Rite Valley of Washington D.C. in 1906. In 1920 he wrote, &quot;In my Masonic life, I have visited lodges in many lands, and I have learned that Freemasonry in many countries, particularly in Latin countries, is the principal means whereby freedom of conscience, of thought, and expression is preserved.&quot;

==Death and legacy==

Gompers&#x27;s health went into serious decline starting in February 1923, when a serious bout of influenza sent him to the hospital, sidelining him from work for six weeks. No sooner had he recovered from the influenza, than he was stricken by a case of bronchitis that laid him low again. By June 1924 Gompers, who suffered from diabetes, could no longer walk without assistance, and he was hospitalized again, this time suffering from congestive heart failure and uremia.

He collapsed in Mexico City on Saturday, December 6, 1924, while attending a meeting of the Pan-American Federation of Labor. It was recognized that his condition was critical and that he might not survive for long. Gompers expressed the desire to die on American soil and he was placed aboard a special train that sped toward the border. He died in San Antonio, Texas. Gompers was buried at the Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, New York. Gompers is buried only a few yards away from industrialist Andrew Carnegie, another important figure of industry in the Gilded Age.

Gompers inspired later generations of labor leaders, such as George Meany, who paid tribute to Gompers as a European immigrant who pioneered a distinctly American brand of unionism. Reuben Soderstrom, president of the Illinois State Federation of Labor and the Illinois AFL-CIO from 1930 to 1970, cited his 1923 encounter with Gompers as particularly formative. Gompers chided Soderstrom after the latter expressed frustration with the slow pace of progress being made in a local strike, telling him &quot;Young man, you know you can climb the highest mountain if you&#x27;ve got the patience to do it one step at a time.&quot; Reuben never forgot those words, stating decades later &quot;that philosophy had a lot to do with guiding the activities I&#x27;ve been engaged in.&quot; 
His belief led to the development of procedures for collective bargaining and contracts between labor and management that remain in use today. In practice, AFL unions were important in industrial cities, where they formed a central labor office to coordinate the actions of different AFL unions. Issues of wages and hours were the usual causes of strikes, but many strikes were assertions of jurisdiction, so that the plumbers, for example, used strikes to ensure that all major construction projects in the city used union plumbers. In this goal they were ideally supported by all the other construction unions in the AFL fold.

Gompers is the subject of statuary in several major American cities. A bronze monument honoring Gompers by the sculptor Robert Aitken is in Gompers Square on Massachusetts Avenue in Washington, D.C. On September 3, 2007, a life-size statue of Gompers was unveiled at Gompers Park, named after the labor leader in 1929, on the northwest side of Chicago. This is the first statue of a labor leader in Chicago. Local unions throughout Chicago donated their time and money to build the monument. A U.S. Navy destroyer tender was named for Gompers. The Samuel Gompers Houses, a public housing development on the Lower East Side of New York, is named in his honor. There are schools named for Gompers in Philadelphia, Madison, Wisconsin, San Diego, Phoenix, Arizona and The Bronx, New York, a school in Chicago renamed to Jesse Owens Community Elementary, and a school in Detroit.

On 27 January 1950, the centennial of Gompers’s birth, the U. S. Post Office Department issued a 3¢ commemorative postage stamp in the Famous Americans series with his picture. Gompers enjoyed listening to the services of the Episcopal National Cathedral which memorialized him on a stained glass window.

<doc id="327157" wikidata="Q470617" url="?curid=327157" title="Pharoah Sanders">
<text>Pharoah Sanders (born Ferrell Lee Sanders; October 13, 1940 – September 24, 2022) was an American jazz saxophonist. Known for his overblowing, harmonic, and multiphonic techniques on the saxophone, as well as his use of &quot;sheets of sound&quot;, Sanders played a prominent role in the development of free jazz and spiritual jazz through his work as a member of John Coltrane&#x27;s groups in the mid-1960s, and later through his solo work. He released more than thirty albums as a leader and collaborated extensively with vocalist Leon Thomas and pianist Alice Coltrane, among many others. Fellow saxophonist Ornette Coleman once described him as &quot;probably the best tenor player in the world&quot;.

Sanders&#x27; take on spiritual jazz was rooted in his inspiration from religious concepts such as &quot;karma&quot; and &quot;tawhid&quot;, and his rich, meditative performance aesthetic. This style was seen as a continuation of Coltrane&#x27;s work on albums such as &quot;A Love Supreme&quot;. As a result, Sanders was considered to have been a disciple of Coltrane or, as Albert Ayler said, &quot;Trane was the Father, Pharoah was the Son, I am the Holy Ghost&quot;.

==Early life==

Pharoah Sanders was born on October 13, 1940, in Little Rock, Arkansas. His mother worked as a cook in a school cafeteria, and his father worked for the City of Little Rock. An only child, Sanders began his musical career accompanying church hymns on clarinet. His initial artistic accomplishments were in the visual arts, but when he was at Scipio Jones High School in North Little Rock, Sanders began playing the tenor saxophone.

After graduating from high school in 1959, Sanders moved to Oakland, California, where he lived with relatives. He briefly studied art and music at Oakland City College. He has earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts from an unknown art institution.

==Career==


===1960s===
Pharoah Sanders began his professional career playing tenor saxophone in Oakland, then moved to New York City in 1962. Sun Ra&#x27;s biographer wrote that Sanders was often homeless and Ra gave him a place to live, clothes, and encouraged him to use the name &quot;Pharoah&quot;. According to Sanders himself his grandmother had wanted to call him after pharaohs in the Bible but chose Ferrell instead. Upon joining the New York musicians&#x27; union, Sanders chose &quot;Pharoah&quot; as an artist name. Initially it was sometimes misspelled as &quot;pharaoh&quot;.

By 1963, he was playing with musicians like Billy Higgins and Don Cherry and had caught the attention of Eric Dolphy and John Coltrane. In 1965, he became a member of Coltrane&#x27;s band, as the latter gravitated towards the avant-garde jazz of Albert Ayler, Sun Ra, and Cecil Taylor. Sanders first recorded with Coltrane on &quot;Ascension&quot; (recorded in June 1965), then on their dual-tenor album &quot;Meditations&quot; (recorded in November 1965). After this, Sanders joined Coltrane&#x27;s final quintet, usually playing long, dissonant solos. Coltrane&#x27;s later style was influenced by Sanders.

Although Sanders&#x27; voice developed differently from John Coltrane&#x27;s, Sanders was influenced by their collaboration. Spiritual elements such as the chanting in &quot;Om&quot; would later show up in many of Sanders&#x27; own works. Sanders would also go on to produce much free jazz, modified from Coltrane&#x27;s solo-centric conception. In 1968, he participated in Michael Mantler and Carla Bley&#x27;s Jazz Composer&#x27;s Orchestra Association album &quot;The Jazz Composer&#x27;s Orchestra&quot;, featuring Cecil Taylor, Don Cherry, Larry Coryell, and Gato Barbieri.

Pharoah&#x27;s first album, &quot;Pharoah&#x27;s First&quot;, was not what he expected. The musicians playing with him were much more straightforward than Sanders, which made the solos played by the other musicians a bit out of place. Starting in 1966 Sanders signed with Impulse! and recorded &quot;Tauhid,&quot; released the following year. The years Sanders spent with the label were both a commercial and critical success.

===1970s and 1980s===
In the 1970s, Sanders continued to produce his own recordings and also continued to work with Alice Coltrane on her &quot;Journey in Satchidananda&quot; album. Most of Sanders&#x27; best-selling work was made in the late 1960s and early 1970s for Impulse Records, including the 30-minute wave-on-wave of free jazz &quot;The Creator Has a Master Plan&quot; from the album &quot;Karma&quot;. This composition featured vocalist Leon Thomas&#x27;s unique, &quot;umbo weti&quot; yodeling, and Sanders&#x27; key musical partner, pianist Lonnie Liston Smith, who worked with Sanders from 1969 to 1971. Other members of his groups in this period include bassist Cecil McBee, on albums such as &quot;Jewels of Thought&quot;, &quot;Izipho Zam&quot;, &quot;Deaf Dumb Blind&quot;, and &quot;Thembi&quot;.

Although supported by African-American radio, Sanders&#x27; brand of brave free jazz became less popular. From the experiments with African rhythms on the 1971 album &quot;Black Unity&quot; (with bassist Stanley Clarke) onwards he began to diversify his sound. In the late 1970s and 1980s, Sanders explored different musical modes including R&amp;B (&quot;Love Will Find a Way&quot;), modal jazz, and hard bop. Sanders left Impulse! in 1973 and explored various other labels, such as Theresa in 1980, which was sold to Evidence in 1991.

===1990s===
In 1992, Sanders appeared on a reissue (&quot;Ed Kelly and Pharoah Sanders&quot;) for the Evidence label of a recording that he completed for Theresa Records in 1979 entitled &quot;Ed Kelly and Friend.&quot; The 1992 version contains extra tracks which feature Pharoah&#x27;s pupil Robert Stewart. In 1994, Sanders traveled to Morocco to record the Bill Laswell-produced album &quot;The Trance Of Seven Colors&quot; with Gnawa musician Mahmoud Guinia. The same year, he appeared on the Red Hot Organization album &quot;Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool&quot; on the track &quot;This is Madness&quot; with Umar Bin Hassan and Abiodun Oyewole and on the bonus track &quot;The Creator Has A Master Plan (Trip Hop Remix).&quot; The album was named &quot;Album of the Year&quot; by &quot;Time&quot;. He also collaborated with drummer–composer Franklin Kiermyer on Kiermyer&#x27;s album &quot;Solomon&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, also released on the Evidence label (re-released with 3 previously unreleased tracks on the Dot Time label in 2019).

Sanders&#x27;s major-label return came in 1995 when Verve Records released &quot;Message from Home&quot;, followed by &quot;Save Our Children&quot; (1998). But again, Sanders&#x27;s disgust with the recording business prompted him to leave the label. Sanders worked with Laswell, Jah Wobble, and others on the albums &quot;Message From Home&quot; (1996) and &quot;Save Our Children&quot; (1999). In 1999, he complained in an interview that despite his pedigree, he had trouble finding work. In 1997 he was featured on several Tisziji Muñoz albums which include Rashied Ali.

===2000s and 2020s===
In the 2000s, a resurgence of interest in jazz kept Sanders playing festivals including the 2004 Bluesfest Byron Bay, the 2007 Melbourne Jazz Festival, and the 2008 Big Chill Festival, concerts, and releasing albums. He has a strong following in Japan, and in 2003 recorded with the band Sleep Walker. In 2000, Sanders released &quot;Spirits&quot; and, in 2003, a live album titled &quot;The Creator Has a Master Plan&quot;. He was awarded an NEA Jazz Masters Fellowship for 2016 and was honored at a tribute concert in Washington DC on April 4, 2016.

In 2020, Sanders recorded an album titled &quot;Promises&quot;, with the English electronic music producer Floating Points and the London Symphony Orchestra. It was released in March 2021, the first major new album by Sanders in nearly two decades. It was widely acclaimed, with &quot;Pitchfork&quot; declaring it &quot;a clear late-career masterpiece&quot;.

===Death===
Sanders died on September 24, 2022, at his home in Los Angeles at the age of 81.

<text>Jeremy Webster &quot;Fred&quot; Frith (born 17 February 1949) is an English multi-instrumentalist, composer, and improviser. Probably best known for his guitar work, Frith first came to attention as a founding member of the English avant-rock group Henry Cow. He was also a member of the groups Art Bears, Massacre, and Skeleton Crew. He has collaborated with numerous musicians, including Robert Wyatt, Derek Bailey, the Residents, Lol Coxhill, John Zorn, Brian Eno, Mike Patton, Lars Hollmer, Bill Laswell, Iva Bittová, Jad Fair, Kramer, the ARTE Quartett, and Bob Ostertag. He has also composed several long works, including &quot;Traffic Continues&quot; (1996, performed 1998 by Frith and Ensemble Modern) and &quot;Freedom in Fragments&quot; (1993, performed 1999 by Rova Saxophone Quartet). Frith produces most of his own music, and has also produced many albums by other musicians, including Curlew, the Muffins, Etron Fou Leloublan, and Orthotonics.

He is the subject of Nicolas Humbert and Werner Penzel&#x27;s 1990 documentary &quot;Step Across the Border&quot;. Frith also appears in the Canadian documentary &quot;Act of God&quot;, which is about the metaphysical effects of being struck by lightning. He has contributed to a number of music publications, including &quot;New Musical Express&quot; and &quot;Trouser Press&quot;, and has conducted improvising workshops across the world. His career spans over four decades and he appears on over 400 albums, and he still performs actively throughout the world.

Frith was awarded the 2008 Demetrio Stratos Prize for his career achievements in experimental music. The prize was established in 2005 in honour of experimental vocalist Demetrio Stratos, of the Italian group Area, who died in 1979. In 2010 Frith received an honorary doctorate from the University of Huddersfield in West Yorkshire, England, in recognition of his contribution to music. Frith was Professor of Composition in the Music Department at Mills College in Oakland, California, until his retirement in 2018. He is the brother of Simon Frith, a music critic and sociologist, and Chris Frith, a psychologist at University College London.

==Musical career==
Frith was born in Heathfield in East Sussex, England into a family where music was considered an essential part of life. He was given the nickname &quot;Fred&quot; at school after the motorcycle road racer Freddie Frith. Frith started violin lessons at the age of five and became a member of his school orchestra, but at 13 switched to guitar after watching a group imitating a popular instrumental band at the time, the Shadows. He decided to learn how to play guitar and get into a band. Frith taught himself guitar from a book of guitar chords and soon found himself in a school group called the Chaperones, playing Shadows and Beatles covers. However, when he started hearing blues music from the likes of Snooks Eaglin and Alexis Korner it changed his whole approach to the guitar, and by the time he was 15, the Chaperones had become a blues band. Frith&#x27;s first public performances were in 1967 in folk clubs in northern England, where he sang and played traditional and blues songs.

Besides the blues, Frith started listening to any music that had guitar in it, including folk, classical, ragtime, and flamenco. He also listened to Indian, Japanese, and Balinese music and was particularly drawn to East European music after a Yugoslav schoolfriend taught him folk tunes from his home. Frith went to Cambridge University in 1967, where his musical horizons were expanded further by the philosophies of John Cage and Frank Zappa&#x27;s manipulation of rock music. Frith graduated from Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, with a BA (English literature) in 1970 (and by Cambridge custom received a pro forma MA in 1974), but the real significance of Cambridge for him was that the seminal avant-rock group Henry Cow formed there.

===Henry Cow===

Frith met Tim Hodgkinson, a fellow student, in a blues club at Cambridge University in 1968. &quot;We&#x27;d never met before, and he had an alto sax, and I had my violin, and we just improvised this ghastly screaming noise for about half an hour.&quot; Something clicked and, recognizing their mutual open-minded approach to music, Frith and Hodgkinson formed a band there and then. They called it Henry Cow and they remained with the band until its demise in 1978. In the early 1970s Fred&#x27;s grey Morris Minor sported the band&#x27;s heraldic logo, much to the amusement of boys at the grammar school in York where his father was headmaster.

Frith composed a number of the band&#x27;s notable pieces, including &quot;Nirvana for Mice&quot; and &quot;Ruins&quot;. While guitar was his principal instrument, he also played violin (drawing on his classical training), bass guitar, piano, and xylophone.

In November 1973, Frith (and other members of Henry Cow) participated in a live-in-the-studio performance of Mike Oldfield&#x27;s &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; for the BBC. It is available on Oldfield&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; DVD.

===&quot;Guitar Solos&quot;===

After Henry Cow&#x27;s first album, Frith released &quot;Guitar Solos&quot; in 1974, his first solo album and a glimpse at what he had been doing with his guitar. The album comprised eight tracks of unaccompanied and improvised music played on prepared guitars. It was recorded in four days, at the Kaleidophon Studios in London&#x27;s Camden Town, without any overdubbing.

When it was released, &quot;Guitar Solos&quot; was considered a landmark album because of its innovative and experimental approach to guitar playing. The January 1983 edition of &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine remarked that &quot;Guitar Solos&quot; &quot;... must have stunned listeners of the day. Even today that album stands up as uniquely innovative and undeniably daring.&quot; It also attracted the attention of some musicians, including Brian Eno, resulting in Frith playing guitar on two of Eno&#x27;s albums, &quot;Before and After Science&quot; (1977) and &quot;Music for Films&quot; (1978).

Between October and December 1974, Frith contributed a series of ten articles to the British weekly music newspaper &quot;New Musical Express&quot; entitled &quot;Great Rock Solos of Our Time&quot;. In them he analysed prominent rock guitarists of the day and their contribution to the development of the rock guitar, including Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton and Frank Zappa.

===Post-Henry Cow===
While recording Henry Cow&#x27;s last album, differences emerged between the group members over the album&#x27;s content. Frith and Chris Cutler favoured song-oriented material, while Hodgkinson and Lindsay Cooper wanted purely instrumental compositions. As a compromise, Frith and Cutler agreed, early in 1978, to release the songs already created on their own album, &quot;Hopes and Fears&quot;, under the name Art Bears (with Dagmar Krause). The instrumental material was recorded by Henry Cow on &quot;Western Culture&quot; later that year, after which the band split. The Art Bears trio continued purely as a studio group until 1981, releasing two more albums, &quot;Winter Songs&quot; in 1979 and &quot;The World as It Is Today&quot; in 1981.

During this time Frith also released &quot;Gravity&quot; (1980), his second solo album, recorded at Norrgården Nyvla in Uppsala, Sweden with Swedish group Samla Mammas Manna, and at the Catch-a-Buzz studio in Rockville, Maryland with United States band The Muffins. It showed Frith breaking free from the highly structured and orchestrated music of Henry Cow and experimenting with folk and dance music. &quot;Norrgården Nyvla&quot; was also the title of one of the tracks on the album and is considered one of Frith&#x27;s most recognisable tunes.

===New York===
Towards the end of 1979, Frith relocated to New York City, where he immediately hooked up with the local avant-garde/downtown music scene. The impact on him was uplifting: &quot;... New York was a profoundly liberating experience for me; for the first time I felt that I could be myself and not try to live up to what I imagined people were thinking about me.&quot; Frith met and began recording with a number of musicians and groups, including Henry Kaiser (&quot;With Friends Like These&quot;, &quot;Who Needs Enemies?&quot;), Bob Ostertag (&quot;Getting a Head&quot;, &quot;Voice of America&quot;), Tom Cora, Eugene Chadbourne, Zeena Parkins, Ikue Mori, the Residents, Material, the Golden Palominos, and Curlew. He spent some 14 years in New York, during which time he joined a few bands, including John Zorn&#x27;s Naked City (in which Frith played bass) and French Frith Kaiser Thompson (consisting of John French, Frith, Henry Kaiser and Richard Thompson). Frith also started three bands himself, namely Massacre, Skeleton Crew, and Keep the Dog.

Massacre was formed in 1980 with bassist Bill Laswell and drummer Fred Maher. A high energy experimental rock band, they toured the United States and Europe in 1980 and 1981, and released one album, &quot;Killing Time&quot; (1981), recorded at Martin Bisi&#x27;s later-to-be historic studio in Brooklyn. Massacre split in 1981 when Maher left, but later reformed again in 1998 when drummer Charles Hayward joined. The new Massacre released three more albums.

Skeleton Crew, a collaboration with Tom Cora from 1982 to 1986, was an experimental group noted for its live improvisations where Frith (guitar, violin, keyboards, drums) and Cora (cello, bass guitar, homemade drums and contraptions) played a number of instruments simultaneously. They performed extensively across Europe, North America and Japan and released &quot;Learn to Talk&quot; in 1984. Zeena Parkins (electric harp and keyboards) joined in 1984 and the trio released &quot;The Country of Blinds&quot; in 1986. In October 1983 Skeleton Crew joined Duck and Cover, a commission from the Berlin Jazz Festival, for a performance in West Berlin, followed by another in February 1984 in East Berlin.

Frith formed Keep the Dog in 1989, a sextet and review band for performing selections of his extensive repertoire of compositions from the previous 15 years. The lineup was Frith (guitar, violin, bass guitar), René Lussier (guitar, bass guitar), Jean Derome (winds), Zeena Parkins (piano, synthesizer, harp, accordion), Bob Ostertag (sampling keyboard), and Kevin Norton (drums, percussion). Later Charles Hayward replaced Norton on drums. The group existed until mid-1991, performing live in Europe, North America and the former Soviet Union. A double CD, &quot;That House We Lived In&quot;, from their final performances in Austria, Germany and Italy in May and June 1991, was released in 2003.

===Other projects===
During the 1980s, Frith began writing music for dance, film, and theatre, and a number of his solo albums from this time reflect this genre, including &quot;The Technology of Tears (And Other Music for Dance and Theatre)&quot; (1988), &quot;Middle of the Moment&quot; (1995), &quot;Allies (Music for Dance, Volume 2)&quot; (1996), and &quot;Rivers and Tides&quot; (2003). Exploring new forms of composition, Frith also experimented with chance or accidental compositions, often created by building music around &quot;found sounds&quot; and field recordings, examples of which can be found on &quot;Accidental (Music for Dance, Volume 3)&quot; (2002) and &quot;Prints: Snapshots, Postcards, Messages and Miniatures, 1987–2001&quot; (2002). He was featured in &#x27;Crossing Bridges&#x27;, a 1983 music programme based around jazz guitar improvisation, and broadcast by Channel 4

As a composer, Frith began composing works for other musicians and groups in the late 1980s, including the Rova Saxophone Quartet, Ensemble Modern, and Arditti Quartet. He composed and performed the song &quot;Choral Ode 2&quot; for the 1993 opera &quot;Agamemnon&quot;. In the late 1990s, Frith established his own Fred Frith Guitar Quartet consisting of Frith, René Lussier, Nick Didkovsky, and Mark Stewart. Their guitar music, varying from &quot;tuneful and pretty, to noisy, aggressive and quite challenging&quot;, appears on two albums, &quot;Ayaya Moses&quot; (1997) and &quot;Upbeat&quot; (1999), both on Lussier&#x27;s own Ambiances Magnétiques label.

The ex-Henry Cow members have always maintained close contact with each other and Frith still collaborates with many of them, including Chris Cutler and Tim Hodgkinson. Cutler and Frith have been touring Europe, Asia, and the Americas since 1978, and have given dozens of duo performances. Three albums from some of these concerts have been released by Recommended Records. In December 2006, Cutler, Frith, and Hodgkinson performed together at the Stone in New York City, their first concert performance since Henry Cow&#x27;s demise in 1978.

In 1995, Frith moved to Stuttgart in Germany to live with his wife, German photographer Heike Liss, and their children Finn and Lucia. Between 1994 and 1996, Frith was composer-in-residence at L&#x27;Ecole Nationale de Musique in Villeurbanne, France.

Frith relocated to the United States in 1997 to become Composer-in-Residence at Mills College in Oakland, California. In 1999 he was appointed the Luther B. Marchant Professor of Composition in the Music Department at Mills, where he taught composition, contemporary performance and improvisation. He is currently Professor Emeritus of Music at Mills, after having retired in 2018. While Frith had never studied music in college, Frith&#x27;s credentials of over forty years of continuous practice and self-discovery got him the position. He has, however, maintained that &quot;most of my students are better qualified to teach composition than I am,&quot; and that he learns as much from them as they learn from him.

In March 1997 Frith formed the electro-acoustic improvisation and experimental trio Maybe Monday with saxophonist Larry Ochs from Rova Saxophone Quartet and koto player Miya Masaoka. Between 1997 and 2008, they toured the United States, Canada, and Europe, and released three albums. In March 2008, Frith formed Cosa Brava, an experimental rock and improvisation quintet with Zeena Parkins from Skeleton Crew and Keep the Dog, Carla Kihlstedt and Matthias Bossi from Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, and the Norman Conquest. They toured Europe in April 2008, and performed at the 25th Festival International de Musique Actuelle de Victoriaville in Victoriaville, Quebec, Canada, the following month.

In 2013, Frith formed the Fred Frith Trio in Oakland, California, an improvising group with bassist Jason Hoopes and drummer/percussionist Jordan Glenn, both from the Oakland experimental song group Jack O&#x27; The Clock. The Trio toured Europe in February 2015, recorded a studio album, &quot;Another Day in Fucking Paradise&quot;, in January 2016, and toured Europe again in February 2017. The album was well received by music critics. In January 2018 the trio recorded their second album, &quot;Closer to the Ground&quot;, which was released in September 2018.

Frith supplied guitar to the albums &quot;The Fates&quot; (2013) and &quot;Folklore&quot; (2017) by Matthew Edwards and the Unfortunates.

Frith has also collaborated with a number of prominent musicians, including Robert Wyatt, Derek Bailey, Lol Coxhill, Lars Hollmer, and the Scottish deaf percussionist Dame Evelyn Glennie.

===Step Across the Border===

&quot;Step Across the Border&quot; is a 1990 documentary film on Fred Frith, written and directed by and , and released in Germany and Switzerland. It was filmed in Japan, Europe, and the United States, and also features musicians René Lussier, Iva Bittová, Tom Cora, Tim Hodgkinson, Bob Ostertag, and John Zorn.

===Fred Records===

In 2002, Fred Frith created his own record label, Fred Records, an imprint of Recommended Records, to re-release his back catalogue of recordings and previously unreleased material.

==Personal life==
During the early years of Henry Cow, Frith was married to Liza White, a teacher in Cambridge. They wed in 1970, but divorced in 1974 after Frith&#x27;s commitment to the band left little private life for the couple. In the early- to mid-1980s, after Henry Cow had split up and Frith had moved to New York City, he was married to Tina Curran, a musician and artist. She played bass guitar on several tracks on Frith&#x27;s albums at the time, and did the photography and artwork for a number of his albums during that period. In the early 1990s Frith married German photographer and performance artist, Heike Liss. She has done the artwork for many of Frith&#x27;s albums, and has performed with him on several occasions. They lived in Germany in the mid-1990s, then moved to California where Frith taught at Mills College until his retirement in 2018.

==Musical style and instruments== 
===Guitars and playing technique===
Fred Frith has used a number of different guitars, including homemade instruments, over the years, depending on the type of music he is playing. For the more structured and refined music he has often used a Gibson ES-345, for example on his solo album, &quot;Gravity&quot;. For the heavier &quot;rock&quot; sound, as in Massacre, he has used an old 1961 solid body Burns guitar, created by the British craftsman Jim Burns. On his landmark &quot;Guitar Solos&quot; album, Frith used a modified 1936 Gibson K-11 guitar (q.v. for details).

For Frith&#x27;s early unstructured music, as with Henry Kaiser on &quot;With Friends Like These&quot;, and his early table-top guitar solo performances, he used a homemade six- and eight-string double-neck guitar created by a friend, Charles Fletcher. Frith told &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine in 1983: &quot;It was the one and only guitar that he ever built ... he constructed it mainly out of old pieces from other guitars that I had, and for the body I think he used an old door.&quot; The possibilities offered by homemade instruments prompted Frith to start creating his own guitars, basically slabs of wood on which he mounted a pickup, a bridge, and strings stretched over metal screws. &quot;The basic design of the instrument is supposed to be as rudimentary and flexible as possible,&quot; Frith said, &quot;so I can use an electric drill to bore holes into the body of it to achieve certain sounds ... .&quot;

Frith uses a variety of implements to play guitar, from traditional guitar picks to violin bows, drum sticks, egg beaters, paint brushes, lengths of metal chain, and other found objects. Frith remarked: &quot;It&#x27;s more to do with my interest in found objects and the use of certain kinds of textures which have an effect on the string ... the difference between the touch of stone, the touch of glass, the touch of wood, the touch of paper – those kinds of basic elements that you&#x27;re using against the surface of the strings which produce different sounds.&quot;

In a typical solo improvising concert, Frith would lay a couple of his homemade guitars flat on a table and play them with a collection of found objects (varying from concert to concert). He would drop objects, like ball bearings, dried beans, and rice on the strings while stroking, scraping, and hitting them with whatever was on hand. Later he added a live sampler to his on-stage equipment, which he controlled with pedals. The sampler enabled him to dynamically capture and loop guitar sounds, over which he would capture and loop new sounds, and so on, until he had a bed of repeated patterns on top of which he would then begin his solo performance.

<text>Peter Brötzmann (6 March 1941 – 22 June 2023) was a German jazz saxophonist and clarinetist regarded as a central and pioneering figure in European free jazz. Throughout his career, he released over fifty albums as a bandleader. Amongst his many collaborators were key figures in free jazz, including Derek Bailey, Anthony Braxton and Cecil Taylor, as well as experimental musicians such as Keiji Haino and Charles Hayward. His 1968 &quot;Machine Gun&quot; became &quot;one of the landmark albums of 20th-century free jazz&quot;.

==Biography==
===Life===

Brötzmann was born in Remscheid on 6 March 1941. He studied painting in Wuppertal and was involved with the Fluxus movement but grew dissatisfied with art galleries and exhibitions. He experienced his first jazz concert when he saw American jazz musician Sidney Bechet while still in school at Wuppertal, and it made a lasting impression. He was also inspired by Miles Davis and John Coltrane.

Brötzmann had not abandoned his art training, designing most of his album covers. He taught himself to play clarinet and saxophone, and is also known for playing the tárogató. Among his first musical partnerships was with double bassist Peter Kowald. &quot;For Adolphe Sax&quot;, Brötzmann&#x27;s first recording, was released in 1967 and featured Kowald and drummer Sven-Åke Johansson. In 1968, &quot;Machine Gun&quot;, an octet recording, was released. The album was self-produced under his BRO record label imprint and sold at concerts, and later marketed by FMP. In 2007, Atavistic reissued &quot;Machine Gun&quot;. &quot;Machine Gun&quot; was a nickname Don Cherry gave him &quot;to describe his violent style&quot;.

Brötzmann died on 22 June 2023, at the age of 82, at home in Wuppertal, Germany.

===Career===
The album &quot;Nipples&quot; was recorded in 1969 with many of the &quot;Machine Gun&quot; musicians, including drummer Han Bennink, pianist Fred Van Hove, tenor saxophonist Evan Parker, and British guitarist Derek Bailey. The second set of takes from these sessions, called &quot;More Nipples&quot;, is more raucous. &quot;Fuck de Boere&quot; (dedicated to Johnny Dyani) is a live album of free sessions from these early years, containing two long improvisations, a 1968 recording of &quot;Machine Gun&quot; live (earlier than the studio version) and a longer jam from 1970. Brötzmann was a member of Bennink&#x27;s Instant Composers Pool, a collective of musicians who released their own records and that grew into a 10-piece orchestra.

The logistics of touring with the ICP tentet or his octet resulted in Brötzmann reducing the group to a trio with Han Bennink and Fred Van Hove. Bennink was a partner in &quot;Schwarzwaldfahrt&quot;, an album of duets recorded outside in the Black Forest in 1977, with Bennink drumming on trees and other objects in the woods.

In 1981, Brötzmann made a radio broadcast with Frank Wright and Willem Breuker (saxophones), Toshinori Kondo (trumpet), Hannes Bauer and Alan Tomlinson (trombones), Alexander von Schlippenbach (piano), Louis Moholo (drums), and Harry Miller (bass). This was released as the album &quot;Alarm&quot;.

In the 1980s, Brötzmann&#x27;s music was influenced by heavy metal and noise rock. He was a member of Last Exit and recorded music with the band&#x27;s bass guitarist and producer Bill Laswell.

Brötzmann released over fifty albums as a bandleader and appeared on dozens more. His &quot;Die Like a Dog Quartet&quot; (with Toshinori Kondo, William Parker, and drummer Hamid Drake) was loosely inspired by saxophonist Albert Ayler, a prime influence on Brötzmann&#x27;s music. Beginning in 1997, he toured and recorded regularly with the Peter Brötzmann Chicago Tentet (initially an octet), which he disbanded after an ensemble performance in November 2012 in Strasbourg, France.

Brötzmann also recorded or performed with Cecil Taylor, Keiji Haino, Willem van Manen, Mats Gustafsson, Ken Vandermark, Conny Bauer, Joe McPhee, Paal Nilssen-Love, with Oxbow, and with Caspar Brötzmann, his son.

<text>In topology, a discipline within mathematics, an Urysohn space, or T2½ space, is a topological space in which any two distinct points can be separated by closed neighborhoods. A completely Hausdorff space, or functionally Hausdorff space, is a topological space in which any two distinct points can be separated by a continuous function. These conditions are separation axioms that are somewhat stronger than the more familiar Hausdorff axiom T2.

==Definitions==

Suppose that &quot;X&quot; is a topological space. Let &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; be points in &quot;X&quot;.
*We say that &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; can be &quot;separated by closed neighborhoods&quot; if there exists a closed neighborhood &quot;U&quot; of &quot;x&quot; and a closed neighborhood &quot;V&quot; of &quot;y&quot; such that &quot;U&quot; and &quot;V&quot; are disjoint (&quot;U&quot; ∩ &quot;V&quot; = ∅). (Note that a &quot;closed neighborhood of &quot;x&quot;&quot; is a closed set that contains an open set containing &quot;x&quot;.)
*We say that &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; can be &quot;separated by a function&quot; if there exists a continuous function &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → [0,1] (the unit interval) with &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = 0 and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) = 1.

A Urysohn space, also called a T2½ space, is a space in which any two distinct points can be separated by closed neighborhoods.

A completely Hausdorff space, or functionally Hausdorff space, is a space in which any two distinct points can be separated by a continuous function.

==Naming conventions==

The study of separation axioms is notorious for conflicts with naming conventions used. The definitions used in this article are those given by Willard (1970) and are the more modern definitions. Steen and Seebach (1970) and various other authors reverse the definition of completely Hausdorff spaces and Urysohn spaces. Readers of textbooks in topology must be sure to check the definitions used by the author. See History of the separation axioms for more on this issue.

==Relation to other separation axioms==

Any two points which can be separated by a function can be separated by closed neighborhoods. If they can be separated by closed neighborhoods then clearly they can be separated by neighborhoods. It follows that every completely Hausdorff space is Urysohn and every Urysohn space is Hausdorff.

One can also show that every regular Hausdorff space is Urysohn and every Tychonoff space (=completely regular Hausdorff space) is completely Hausdorff. In summary we have the following implications:
One can find counterexamples showing that none of these implications reverse.

==Examples==

The cocountable extension topology is the topology on the real line generated by the union of the usual Euclidean topology and the cocountable topology. Sets are open in this topology if and only if they are of the form &quot;U&quot; \ &quot;A&quot; where &quot;U&quot; is open in the Euclidean topology and &quot;A&quot; is countable. This space is completely Hausdorff and Urysohn, but not regular (and thus not Tychonoff).

There exist spaces which are Hausdorff but not Urysohn, and spaces which are Urysohn but not completely Hausdorff or regular Hausdorff. Examples are non trivial; for details see Steen and Seebach.

<text>Warren Harding &quot;Sonny&quot; Sharrock (August 27, 1940 – May 25, 1994) was an American jazz guitarist. His first wife was singer Linda Sharrock, with whom he recorded and performed.

One of only a few prominent guitarists who participated in the first wave of free jazz during the 1960s, Sharrock was known for his heavily chorded attack, use of feedback, and distorted saxophone-like lines. His early work also features creative use of slide guitar.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Sonny Sharrock was born Warren Harding Sharrock on August 27, 1940, in Ossining, New York. He began his musical career singing doo-wop in his teen years. He collaborated with Pharoah Sanders and Alexander Solla in the late 1960s, first appearing on Sanders&#x27;s 1966 album &quot;Tauhid&quot;. He made several appearances with flautist Herbie Mann and an uncredited appearance on Miles Davis&#x27; &quot;A Tribute to Jack Johnson&quot;.

Sharrock first wanted to play tenor saxophone after hearing John Coltrane on Davis&#x27; &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; at age 19, but his asthma prevented this. However, he considered himself &quot;a horn player with a really fucked up axe.&quot;

Three albums under Sharrock&#x27;s name were released from the late 1960s to the mid-1970s: &quot;Black Woman&quot;, &quot;Monkey-Pockie-Boo&quot;, and &quot;Paradise&quot; (which he later disavowed).

===Career revival===
After the release of &quot;Paradise&quot;, Sharrock semi-retired for much of the 1970s and early 1980s. Undergoing a divorce from his wife and collaborator Linda in 1978, he worked as a chauffeur and a caretaker for mentally challenged children. At bassist and producer Bill Laswell’s urging, Sharrock came out of retirement to appear on Material&#x27;s 1981 album &quot;Memory Serves&quot;. Starting in 1986, Sharrock was a member of Last Exit with Laswell, saxophonist Peter Brötzmann, and drummer Ronald Shannon Jackson. During the late 1980s, he performed extensively with the New York-based band Machine Gun and led his own band. Sharrock flourished with Laswell&#x27;s help, noting in a 1991 interview that &quot;the last five years have been pretty strange for me, because I went twelve years without making a record at all, and then in the last five years, I&#x27;ve made seven records under my own name. That&#x27;s pretty strange.&quot;

Laswell produced most of Sharrock&#x27;s later recordings, including the entirely solo &quot;Guitar&quot;, the &quot;metal-influenced&quot; &quot;Seize the Rainbow&quot;, and &quot;Highlife&quot;. Sharrock&#x27;s band at the time featured Abe Speller on percussion, Lance Carter on drums, Charles Baldwin on bass, and David Snider on keyboards. These albums were followed by &quot;Ask the Ages&quot; in 1991, which featured Pharoah Sanders and drummer Elvin Jones. One writer described &quot;Ask the Ages&quot; as &quot;hands down, Sharrock&#x27;s finest hour, and the ideal album to play for those who claim to hate jazz guitar.&quot; Sharrock recorded music for the adult animated television series &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; with drummer Lance Carter; this was one of the last projects he completed in the studio before his death. The &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; episode &quot;Sharrock&quot; carried a dedication to him at the end, and previously unheard music that he had recorded for the show was featured throughout most of the episode.

===Death===
On May 25, 1994, as he was on the verge of signing his first major label contract, Sharrock died of a heart attack in Ossining. He was 53 years old. He is survived by his second wife, Dannette Hill, and their daughter Jasmyn.

==Tributes==
French guitarist Noël Akchoté&#x27;s 2004 album &quot;Sonny II&quot; features tracks written, performed, and inspired by Sharrock. 

In August 2010, S. Malcolm Street in Ossining was officially renamed &quot;Sonny Sharrock Way&quot;. A sign was erected on Saturday, October 2, 2010. Sharrock was also inducted into Ossining High School&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

<text>King Li of Zhou (died in 828 BC) (), also known as King Fen of Zhou (周汾王), personal name Ji Hu, was a king of the Zhou dynasty of China. Estimated dates of his reign are 877–841 BC or 857–842 BC (&quot;Cambridge History of Ancient China&quot;).
Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; depict King Li as a corrupt and decadent king. To pay for his pleasures and vices, King Li raised taxes and caused misery among his subjects. It is said that he barred the commoners from profiting from the communal forests and lakes. He enstated a new law which allowed him to punish anyone, by death, who dared to speak against him. King Li&#x27;s bad rule soon forced many peasants and soldiers into revolt, and Li was sent into exile at a place called Zhi near Linfen (842 BC). His son was taken by one of his ministers and hidden. 
When Li died in exile in 828 BC, power was passed to his son.

==Shen Dao fragments==
The Shen Dao fragments also depict King Li as a decadent and corrupt king. The fragments say:

==Family==
===Queens===
* Shen Jiang, of the Jiang clan of Shen (), a sister of the Count of Shen; the mother of Crown Prince Jing and You

===Sons===
* Crown Prince Jing (; d. 782 BC), ruled as King Xuan of Zhou from 827 to 782 BC
* Prince You (; d. 771 BC), ruled as Duke Huan of Zheng from 806 to 771 BC
** Served as the Minister of Education of Zhou from 773 to 771 BC

<text>Arthur Morgan &quot;Arto&quot; Lindsay (born May 28, 1953) is an American guitarist, singer, record producer and experimental composer. He was a member of the pioneering 1970s no wave group DNA, which featured on the 1978 compilation &quot;No New York&quot;. In the 1980s, he formed the group Ambitious Lovers. He also performed with the Golden Palominos and the Lounge Lizards.

He has a distinctive soft voice and an often noisy, self-taught guitar style consisting almost entirely of unconventional extended techniques, described by Brian Olewnick as &quot;studiedly naïve ... sounding like the bastard child of Derek Bailey&quot;.

== Music ==

Although Lindsay was born in the United States, he grew up in Brazil. In the late 1970s, he helped form the no wave band DNA with Ikue Mori and Robin Crutchfield, although Tim Wright of Pere Ubu soon replaced Crutchfield. In 1978, DNA was featured on the four-band sampler &quot;No New York&quot; (produced by Brian Eno). In the early 1980s, Lindsay performed on early albums by The Lounge Lizards and The Golden Palominos. &quot;He&#x27;s never lost his interest in weirdness,&quot; Robert Christgau wrote, &quot;even ran the Kitchen for a year, and in the eighties his unschooled guitar was in demand all over downtown as he radiated out from the overlapping John Lurie, Anton Fier, John Zorn, and Kip Hanrahan circles to enterprising jazz and funk guys as well as Cuban drummers...&quot;

After the Lounge Lizards, Lindsay and keyboardist Peter Scherer formed the Ambitious Lovers, influenced by pop, samba, and bossa nova. In an interview with &quot;Bomb&quot; magazine, Linsday said, &quot;the whole idea was Al Green and samba. That against this; this against that; not a blend, a juxtaposition, loud/soft. There&#x27;s no particular point in putting these things together. The point is what comes out in the end.&quot; The band&#x27;s albums included &quot;Envy&quot;, &quot;Greed&quot;, and &quot;Lust&quot;.

== Producer ==
Lindsay began his experience as producer in 1981 working with Italian No wave band Hi-Fi Bros. He has produced recordings by Brazilian musicians Caetano Veloso, Tom Zé, Vinicius Cantuária, Gal Costa, Carlinhos Brown, Marisa Monte, Adriana Calcanhotto, Orquestra Contemporânea de Olinda and Lucas Santtana. He also co-produced the first album of Anarchist Republic of Bzzz, and CHASM by Ryuichi Sakamoto.

== Collaborations ==
Lindsay lent his talents to the 1993 opera &quot;Agamemnon&quot; and to Jun Miyake&#x27;s &quot;Stolen From Strangers&quot; album (2008), providing vocals and guitar on the album&#x27;s opener &quot;Alviveride&quot; as well as on &quot;O Fim&quot;, &quot;Turn Back&quot; and &quot;Outros Escuros&quot;. For Performa 09, the third edition of the Performa Biennial, Lindsay created &quot;Somewhere I Read&quot; collaborating with the choreographer Lily Baldwin. In 2013, Lindsay sang on &quot;I Guess We&#x27;re Floating&quot; by Stephon Alexander and Rioux. The song was released on the album &quot;Here Comes Now&quot; in August 2014 by Connect Records.

== Exhibition ==
* netmage 2006 performs &quot;Ipanema Théories&quot; with Dominique Gonzalez Foerster and alone&quot; Garden of self regard&quot;

== Discography ==
More or less comprehensive, this discography integrates all recordings as a leader, band projects and contributions to albums by other musicians. Lindsay&#x27;s own work can simply be singled out by sorting &quot;Leading artist&quot;. Minor contributions may only be mentioned in the notes of an earlier album of the respective artist. The &quot;No New York&quot; compilation is added due to its significance. Later compilations of older material are listed with the recording year followed by the release date in brackets. Within a year the albums are sorted alphabetically by artist not by specified dates. (&quot;Leading artist&quot; sorts by first name.)

<text>Sir George Thomas Staunton, 2nd Baronet, , (26 May 1781 – 10 August 1859) was a British writer, orientalist and politician.

==Early life==

Born at Milford House near Salisbury, he was the son of Sir George Leonard Staunton (1737–1801), first baronet, diplomatist and Orientalist. In 1792, at the age of 12, he accompanied his father, who had been appointed secretary to Lord Macartney&#x27;s mission to China, to the Far East (1792–1794). Prior to the trip the young George Staunton had begun to learn Chinese alongside Sir John Barrow, 1st Baronet and for the duration was therefore given the role of Page to Lord Macartney. During the mission his Chinese proved good enough to engage in diplomatic banter and he received a personal gift from the Qianlong Emperor. In 1797 he spent two terms at Trinity College, Cambridge.

==In the employ of the East India Company==
In 1798 was appointed a writer in the British East India Company&#x27;s factory at Canton (Guangzhou), and subsequently its chief. During this time his knowledge of Chinese increased. In 1805 he translated a work of Dr George Pearson into Chinese. Five years later, he published an English translation of a significant part of the Chinese legal code.

In 1801 he succeeded his father to the baronetcy and in April 1803 was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

Many people came to ask for help in both learning the Chinese dialect there and staying, including Robert Morrison and Thomas Manning.

In 1816 Staunton proceeded as second commissioner on a special mission to Beijing with Lord Amherst and Sir Henry Ellis. During the mission he landed in Hong Kong in July 1816. He walked from the shore of Hong Kong to Hong Kong Village via Wong Chuk Hang. After the trip, Wong Chuk Hang was named Staunton Creek and the valley where Hong Kong Village was located was named Staunton Valley. Staunton Creek later became a large sampan slum - it and was eventually cleared and boat people moved into Wong Chuk Hang Estate. Said village was most likely Wong Chuk Hang Lo Wai; only Wong Chuk Hang San Wai still exists at the bottom of Shouson Hill. After the ceding of Hong Kong to Britain, Staunton Street in Central was named after him.

The embassy was unsuccessful - and suffered a serious ship-wreck on the return journey - and shortly afterwards Staunton decided to leave Canton permanently.

==Back in Britain==

George Staunton had been looking for a country home for some years before his permanent return from China and in 1818 put in a bid for Newstead Abbey but was outbid by Thomas Wildman. In 1820 he purchased the Leigh estate in Hampshire which included what was to become Staunton Country Park. He lived there for part of each year and made substantial alterations to the buildings and the landscape.

Three years later he was heavily involved with the founding of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland. Their Sir George Staunton Prize is awarded annually.

Between 1818 and 1852 he was MP for several English constituencies, finally for Portsmouth. He latterly described himself as being during his early years in parliament a liberal Tory who looked to George Canning for leadership. He was a member of the East India Committee, and in 1823, in conjunction with Henry Thomas Colebrooke founded the Royal Asiatic Society.

From 1829 until 1856 he was a member of the Society of Dilettanti

He had never married and the baronetcy became extinct on his death (in London). He left his Irish estate, Clydagh House, to his eldest cousin George Staunton Lynch (who took the additional surname of Staunton) and Leigh Park and his London house (17, Devonshire Street, Marylebone) to George Staunton Lynch&#x27;s younger brother, Captain Henry Cormick Lynch.

==Publications==
His publications include translations of &quot;Great Qing Legal Code&quot;, known as the &quot;Fundamental Laws of China&quot; (1810) and of the &quot;Narrative of the Chinese Embassy to the Khan of the Tourgouth Tartars&quot; (1821); &quot;Miscellaneous Notices Relating to China and our Commercial Intercourse with that Country&quot; (1822); &quot;Notes of Proceedings and Occurrences during the British Embassy to Peking&quot; (1824); &quot;Observations on our Chinese Commerce&quot; (1850). For the Hakluyt Society he edited Juan González de Mendoza&#x27;s &quot;History of the Great and Mighty Kingdom of China&quot;.

<text>Jeonju (, , ) is the capital and largest city of North Jeolla Province, South Korea. It is both urban and rural due to the closeness of Wanju County which almost entirely surrounds Jeonju (Wanju County has many residents who work in Jeonju). It is an important tourist center famous for Korean food, historic buildings, sports activities, and innovative festivals.

In May 2012, Jeonju was chosen as a Creative City for Gastronomy as part of UNESCO&#x27;s Creative Cities Network. This honour recognizes the city&#x27;s traditional home cooking handed down over thousands of years, its active public and private food research, a system of nurturing talented chefs, and its hosting of distinctive food festivals.

Jeonju is a city with over 1,300 years of history and culture. The city has produced many scholars and has a developed publishing industry.

== Cityscape ==
== Geography and administrative divisions ==
===Administrative divisions===
Jeonju is divided into two wards, Deokjin District and Wansan District that, in turn, are divided into approximately 40 neighborhoods.

===Climate===
Jeonju has a cooler version of a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cwa&quot;), with winter being warm enough to avoid being classified as an humid continental (&quot;Dwa&quot;) if the 0 °C isotherm is used.

Jeonju, like all of Korea, has four distinct seasons (spring, summer, fall, and winter). The winters can have a mix of days that are cool to days that are quite cold. The colder days are often influenced by a high pressure front that brings cold air from Siberia.

In the summer, the humidity of Southeast Asia comes over the Korean peninsula from June through September. Temperatures in spring (late April and through May) and fall (after September 25 and through October) are often in the mid-20s°C and with low humidity.

===Demographics===
== History ==
===Samguk (1C BC–7C AD)===
The Baekje kingdom was located in southwestern Korea which included the area Jeonju is now located. It is believed that Jeonju was founded as a market town within Baekje around 57 BC.

Jeonju (along with Baekje in general) was conquered by the kingdom of Silla in 660 AD. It soon became part of the Silla kingdom and in 685, Jeonju became one of the nine &quot;chu&quot; (a provincial capital of the kingdom). From 889 and onward, peasant revolts (caused from over taxation) became widespread throughout the kingdom and it also spread to Jeonju where it became the headquarters of one of the most powerful rebel leaders of the time, Gyeon Hwon. In 892 (or 900), Gyeon Hwon renamed the city Wansan and established it as the capital of the Later Baekje kingdom. From Wansan, Gyeon Hwon campaigned against Silla which climaxed with the destruction of Geumseong (the capital of the Silla kingdom) and the assassination of King Gyeongae in 927. With the decline of Silla, Gyeon Hwon and Wang Geon (of the Goryeo kingdom) waged battle for control of the peninsula. However, Wang Geon and his forces invaded Later Baekje in 934 and Jeonju surrendered to him in 935.

===Goryeo (918–1392)===
Under Goryeo rule, Jeonju reverted to being a provincial capital and enjoyed relative stability and economic growth. However, in 1182, the city was taken by peasant rebels with the aid of governmental troops stationed there who resented being forced to do heavy labor along slaves. The rebellion was soon suppressed forty days after it began.

===Joseon (1392–1897)===
The Joseon defeated Goryeo and founded a new dynasty in 1392 and took all their possessions including Jeonju. The Joseon considered Jeonju their ancestral home (an ancestor of Yi Seonggye of Joseon may have fled Jeonju after the 1182 peasant revolt). During the Joseon period, Jeonju became the capital of a reorganized Jeolla (one of the eight provinces of the Joseon). In 1413, Jeonju (along with three other cities) was given the honor of safekeeping copies of the &quot;Annals of the Joseon Dynasty&quot; which still survives extant in the former Confucian academy in Jeonju.

The town was occupied by the Donghak Peasant Revolution in 1894. Jeonju was occupied by the Japanese beginning from 1910 to 1945, and was renamed to Zenshū during the period. The ancient walls of the old city were destroyed by the Japanese authorities with the gate Pungnammun () being the only remnant left today. Jeonju&#x27;s population grew between 1925 and 1949 when it reached 100,000 inhabitants. Jeonju was given metropolitan status in 1935, and the city was founded in 1949. During the Division of Korea, Jeonju was not in the immediate frontline of the war but by the armistice signing in July 1953, Jeonju (along with many other cities) suffered bombardment and the loss of many male residents who fought during the war.

===Today===
Jeonju was given its modern boundaries and government system in 1963. It has since then industrialized rapidly. Since the Joseon dynasty period, it was a metropolis, but it did not experience industrialization in the 20th century compared to other parts of Korea. It does not have the industrial infrastructure, manufacturing, or heavy industries found in other major Korean cities. Today, traditional tourism and sightseeing is a major industry in the city.

<text>Ronald Shannon Jackson (January 12, 1940 – October 19, 2013) was an American jazz drummer from Fort Worth, Texas. A pioneer of avant-garde jazz, free funk, and jazz fusion, he appeared on over 50 albums as a bandleader, sideman, arranger, and producer. Jackson and bassist Sirone are the only musicians to have performed and recorded with the three prime shapers of free jazz: pianist Cecil Taylor, and saxophonists Ornette Coleman and Albert Ayler.

&quot;Musician, Player and Listener&quot; magazine writers David Breskin and Rafi Zabor called him &quot;the most stately free-jazz drummer in the history of the idiom, a regal and thundering presence.&quot; Gary Giddins wrote &quot;Jackson is an astounding drummer, as everyone agrees...he has emerged as a kind of all-purpose new-music connoisseur who brings a profound and unshakably individual approach to every playing situation.&quot;

In 1979, he founded his own group, the Decoding Society, playing what has been dubbed free funk: a blend of funk rhythm and free jazz improvisation.

== Early life and career ==
Jackson was born in Fort Worth, Texas. As a child, he was immersed in music. His father monopolized the local jukebox business and established the only African American-owned record store in the Fort Worth area. His mother played piano and organ at their local church. Between the ages of five and nine he took piano lessons. In the third grade, he studied music with John Carter.

Jackson graduated from I.M. Terrell High School, where he played with the marching band and learned about symphonic percussion. During lunch breaks, students would conduct jam sessions in the band room.

Around the same time, Jackson&#x27;s mother bought him his first drum set to encourage him to graduate from high school. By the age of 15, he was playing professionally. His first paid gig was with tenor saxophonist James Clay, who went on to join Ray Charles as a sideman.

Jackson recalled that &quot;we were playing four nights a week, with two gigs each on Saturday and Sunday, anything from Ray Charles to bebop. People were dancing, and when it was time to listen, they&#x27;d listen. But I was brainwashed into thinking you couldn&#x27;t make a living playing music.&quot;

After graduation, Jackson attended Lincoln University in Jefferson City, Missouri. He chose Lincoln because of its proximity to St. Louis and accessibility to great musicians touring the Midwest. His roommate was pianist John Hicks. As undergraduates, they &quot;spent as much time performing together as studying.&quot; The Lincoln University band included Jackson, Hicks, trumpeter Lester Bowie, and Julius Hemphill on saxophone.

Jackson then transferred to Texas Southern University, and from there went to Prairie View A &amp; M. He decided to study history and sociology at the University of Bridgeport in Connecticut. Jackson intended not to play music at all, but after exposure to various artists and styles, he concluded that &quot;the beat is in your body&quot; and &quot;the music you play comes from your life.&quot; By 1966, Jackson received a full music scholarship to New York University through trumpeter Kenny Dorham.

== New York and the Avant-Garde (1966–1978) ==
Once in New York, Jackson performed with many jazz musicians, including Charles Mingus, Betty Carter, Jackie McLean, Joe Henderson, Kenny Dorham, McCoy Tyner, Stanley Turrentine, and others. Whenever he would ask Charles Mingus to consider him for his group, Mingus used to push him &quot;rudely out of his way&quot;. After Jackson sat in with pianist Toshiko Akiyoshi, he heard loud clapping behind him. It was Mingus, who asked him to play with his band.

In 1966 Jackson recorded drums for saxophonist Charles Tyler&#x27;s release,&quot; Charles Tyler Ensemble&quot;. Between 1966 and 1967, he played with saxophonist Albert Ayler and is featured on &quot;At Slug&#x27;s Saloon, Vol. 1 &amp; 2&quot;. He is also on disks 3 and 4 of Ayler&#x27;s &quot;Holy Ghost: Rare &amp; Unissued Recordings (1962–70)&quot;. Jackson said Ayler was &quot;the first (leader) that really opened me up. He let me play the drums the way I did in Fort Worth when I wasn&#x27;t playing for other people.&quot; John Coltrane&#x27;s death in July 1967 devastated Jackson. He spent the next few years addicted to heroin. He said, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t play drums then, spiritually... I just didn&#x27;t feel right.&quot; From 1970–74, he did not perform, but continued to practice.

In 1974, pianist Onaje Allan Gumbs introduced Jackson to Nichiren Buddhism and chanting. Although initially reluctant, Jackson decided to try it for three weeks. &quot;Then three months had passed. It pulled me together and pulled me out and I was able to focus. I was a Buddhist and a vegetarian for 17 years.&quot;

By 1975 he joined saxophonist Ornette Coleman&#x27;s electric free funk band, Prime Time. During his stint in Prime Time, Coleman taught Jackson composition and harmolodics. Jackson says that Coleman told him he was hearing music &quot;in that piccolo range,&quot; and encouraged him to compose on the flute. Jackson went to Paris with Prime Time in 1976 to perform concerts and record &quot;Dancing in Your Head&quot; and &quot;Body Meta&quot;.

In 1978, Jackson played on four albums with pianist Cecil Taylor: &quot;Cecil Taylor Unit&quot;, &quot;3 Phasis&quot;, &quot;Live in the Black Forest&quot;, and &quot;One Too Many Salty Swift and Not Goodbye&quot;.

== The Decoding Society and Other Projects (1979–1999) ==
Jackson formed his band, The Decoding Society, in 1979, as a showcase for his blend of avant-garde jazz, rock, funk, and ethnic music. The instrumentation and arrangements, along with Jackson&#x27;s compositions and drum style, brought The Decoding Society critical acclaim. Although considered to be part of the &quot;new fusion&quot; movement that emerged from Ornette Coleman&#x27;s harmolodic concepts, Jackson was able to implement a voice of his own.

The Decoding Society&#x27;s music can be hot, savage, and danceable, or cool, gentle, and contemplative. American, Eastern, and African sounds are distilled under Jackson&#x27;s guidance. Meters, feels, tempos, and stylistic references are heard throughout different compositions; many times within a single piece of music.

Unlike many of Jackson&#x27;s contemporaries, The Decoding Society incorporates pop music elements into its avant-garde approach. Guitarist Vernon Reid has said of Shannon that he &quot;wasn&#x27;t an ideological avant-gardist. He made the music he made from an outsider&#x27;s view, but not to the exclusion of rock and pop – he wasn&#x27;t mad at pop music for being popular the way some of his generation are. He synthesized blues shuffles with African syncopations through the lens of someone who gave vent to all manner of emotions...the collision of values in his music really represents American culture.&quot;

Common characteristics among the incarnations of The Decoding Society include doubled instrumentation (basses, saxophones, or guitars). Polyphony often predominates harmony; compositions are not focused on one key. Polyphonic textures equalize harmony, rhythm, and melody, dispensing with traditional ideas of key and pitch. Each instrument can play a rhythmic, harmonic, or melodic role, or any combination of the three. The lines between solos, lead instruments, and accompaniment are blurred. Looseness in pitch and rhythm create heterophony within unison-based parts, which also adds to the tonal ambiguity.

Melodies can alternate from busy, frenetic, multiple themes to simple, lazy, lyrical phrases. They often function as both heads and melodic material to accompany one or more soloist. Sometimes the melodies are diatonic, other times they are bluesy; occasionally they sound &quot;Eastern&quot;. Although The Decoding Society is more of a composer&#x27;s band rather than a vehicle for soloing or drumming, free-blowing solos abound, and Jackson&#x27;s thunderous playing is heavily featured.

Throughout the years, the Decoding Society has featured the performances of Akbar Ali, Bern Nix, Billy Bang, Byrad Lancaster, Cary Denigris, Charles Brackeen, David Fiuczynski, David Gordon, Tomchess, Dominic Richards, Eric Person, Henry Scott, Jef Lee Johnson, John Moody, Khan Jamal, Lee Rozie, Masujaa, Melvin Gibbs, Onaje Allan Gumbs, Reggie Washington, Reverend Bruce Johnson, Robin Eubanks, Vernon Reid, and Zane Massey.

In addition to leading Decoding Society lineups, Jackson was involved in other projects. Guitarist and fellow Coleman alumnus James Blood Ulmer recruited Jackson for another group that intended to push harmolodics to a new level 

In 1986 Jackson, Sonny Sharrock, Peter Brötzmann, and Bill Laswell formed the free jazz supergroup, Last Exit, which performed and released five live albums and one studio album, before Sharrock&#x27;s death in 1994 saw the end of the band.

In the late 1980s, Jackson teamed up with Laswell on two other projects: SXL, with violinist L. Shankar, Senegalese drummer Aiyb Dieng, and Korean percussion group SamulNori, and the free jazz trio, Mooko, with Japanese saxophonist Akira Sakata.

With the help of some grants, Jackson took a three-month trip to West Africa and visited nine countries. The trip, both a personal and artistic milestone, inspired music for the Decoding Society&#x27;s &quot;When Colors Play&quot;, recorded live at the Caravan of Dreams in September 1986. Author Norman C. Weinstein detailed the excursion in a chapter of his book, &quot;A Night in Tunisia: Imaginings of Africa in Jazz&quot;, titled &quot;Ronald Shannon Jackson: Journey to Africa Without End.&quot;

In 1987, Jackson formed an avant-garde power trio with bassist Melvin Gibbs and guitarist Bill Frisell called Power Tools. They released and toured behind an album titled &quot;Strange Meeting&quot;. Writer Greg Tate referred to the project as &quot;that awesome and under-sung Power Tools album...in my humble opinion, the most paradigm-shifting power trio record since Band of Gypsys.&quot;

== Later career (2000–2013) ==
His output slowed in the early 2000s due to nerve damage in his left arm. After consulting with a neurologist, Jackson declined surgery and was able to regain his strength through years of physical therapy. Physical limitations did not diminish his output as a composer, and he unveiled new material on YouTube in 2012.

Jackson joined trumpeter Wadada Leo Smith&#x27;s Golden Quartet with pianist Vijay Iyer and double-bassist John Lindberg in 2005. Their collaboration is documented on the &quot;Tabligh&quot; CD and the &quot;Eclipse&quot; DVD.

He played with the Punk Funk All Stars in 2006, which included Melvin Gibbs, Joseph Bowie, Vernon Reid, and James Blood Ulmer. In 2008 Jackson and Jamaaladeen Tacuma toured Europe with The Last Poets; this collaboration was documented in the film &quot;The Last Poets / Made in Amerikkka&quot; directed by Claude Santiago.

In 2011 Jackson, Vernon Reid and Melvin Gibbs formed a power trio called Encryption. During their trip to the Moers Festival in Germany, Jackson suffered a heart attack and underwent an angioplasty. The next day, he checked himself out of the hospital to play with Reid and Gibbs at the festival. Afterwards, Jackson checked himself back in for medical observation.

On July 7, 2012, Jackson performed at the Kessler Theater in Dallas with the latest version of the Decoding Society, which includes violinist Leonard Hayward, trumpeter John Weir, guitarist Gregg Prickett, and bassist Melvin Gibbs. The new compositions were described as being as strong as the best of his recorded work. The performance was voted as one of the Ten Best Concerts of 2012 in the Dallas Observer.

== Death ==
Jackson died of leukemia on October 19, 2013, aged 73.

<doc id="327195" wikidata="Q138733" url="?curid=327195" title="Tripitaka Koreana">
<text>The &#x27; is a Korean collection of the (Buddhist scriptures), carved onto 81,258 wooden printing blocks in the 13th century. They are currently located at the Buddhist temple Haeinsa, in South Gyeongsang Province, South Korea. It is the oldest intact version of Buddhist canon in Hanja script. It contains 1,496 titles, divided into 6,568 books, spanning 81,258 pages, for a total 52,330,152 Hanja characters. It is often called the Palman Daejanggyeong (&quot;Eighty-thousand Tripitaka&quot;) due to the number of the printing plates that comprise it. It is also known as the Goryeo Daejanggyeong&quot;&quot;&#x27; (Goryeo dynasty Tripitaka).

Each wood block (page) measures 24 centimetres in height and 70 centimetres () in length. The thickness of the blocks ranges from and each weighs about three to four kilograms (6.61 - 8.81 lbs). The woodblocks would be almost as tall as Paektu Mountain at if stacked and would measure long if lined up, and weigh 280 tons in total. The woodblocks are in pristine condition without warping or deformation despite being created more than 750 years ago.

The &quot;Tripiṭaka&quot; was designated a National Treasure of South Korea in 1962, and inscribed in the UNESCO Memory of the World international register in 2007. Historically the &quot;Tripiṭaka&quot; was closed except for Buddhist events and scholars but 2021 it was opened to members of the public who preregister.

== Name ==
There is a movement by scholars to change the English name of the &quot;Tripiṭaka Koreana&quot;. Professor Robert Buswell Jr., a leading scholar of Korean Buddhism, called for the renaming of the Tripiṭaka Koreana to the Korean Buddhist Canon, indicating that the current nomenclature is misleading because the &quot;Tripiṭaka Koreana&quot; is much greater in scale than the actual Tripiṭaka, and includes much additional content such as travelogues, Sanskrit and Chinese dictionaries, and biographies of monks and nuns.

==History==
The name Goryeo &quot;Tripiṭaka&quot; comes from &quot;Goryeo&quot;, the name of Korea from the 10th to the 14th centuries.

Work on the first &quot;Tripiṭaka Koreana&quot; began in 1011 during the Goryeo–Khitan War and was completed in 1087. Choi&#x27;s Goryeo Military Regime, which moved the capital to Ganghwa Island due to Mongol invasions, set up a temporary organization called &quot;Daejang Dogam&quot;.

The act of carving the woodblocks was considered to be a way of bringing about a change in fortune by invoking the Buddha&#x27;s help. The first &quot;Tripiṭaka Koreana&quot; was based primarily on the Kaibao Canon completed in the 10th century, but other scriptures published until then, such as the Khitan Tripiṭaka, were also consulted in order to identify items in need of revision and adjustment. The first Tripiṭaka Koreana contained around 6,000 volumes.

The original set of woodblocks was destroyed by fire during the Mongol invasions of Korea in 1232, when Goryeo&#x27;s capital was moved to Ganghwa Island during nearly three decades of Mongol incursions, although scattered parts of its prints still remain. To once again implore divine assistance with combating the Mongol threat, King Gojong thereafter ordered the revision and re-creation of the &quot;Tripiṭaka&quot;; the carving began in 1237 and was completed in 12 years, with support from Ch&#x27;oe U and his son Ch&#x27;oe Hang, and involving monks from both the Seon and Gyo schools. This second version is usually what is meant by the &quot;Tripiṭaka Koreana&quot;. In 1398, it was moved to Haeinsa, where it has remained housed in four buildings.

The production of the &quot;Tripiṭaka Koreana&quot; was an enormous national commitment of money and manpower, according to Robert Buswell Jr., perhaps comparable to the US 1960s Apollo program Moon landings. Thousands of scholars and craftsmen were employed in this massive project.

==Evaluation and Significance==
The &quot;Tripiṭaka Koreana&quot; is the 32nd National Treasure of South Korea, and Haeinsa, the depository for the &quot;Tripiṭaka Koreana&quot;, has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The UNESCO committee describes the &quot;Tripiṭaka Koreana&quot; as &quot;one of the most important and most complete corpus of Buddhist doctrinal texts in the world&quot;. Not only is the work invaluable, it is also aesthetically valuable and shows a high quality of workmanship. Currently, the Palman Daejanggyeong is one of the three woodblocks in the world that are registered on UNESCO.

The Tripiṭaka Koreana is stored in Haeinsa temple. While most of the wood blocks have remained in pristine condition for more than 750 years, a few were damaged when a new depository was built in the early 1970s (by the Park Chung Hee regime) and few blocks were transplanted to the new building on a trial basis. Those blocks were damaged almost immediately. They were subsequently moved back to their initial spots and the new building was shut down. That building is now the &#x27;Zen Center&#x27;. Currently there are ongoing debates as to the quality of the current storage area.

The historical value of the Tripiṭaka Koreana comes from the fact that it is the most complete and accurate extant collection of Buddhist treatises, laws, and scriptures. It is a popular misconception that the &quot;Tripitaka Koreana&quot; does not contain a single error; a survey found that the text does indeed have missing characters and errors. The compilers of the Korean version incorporated older Northern Song Chinese, Khitan, and Goryeo versions, and added content written by respected Korean monks. Contemporary scholars are able to conduct research about the older Chinese and Khitan versions of the Tripiṭaka using the Korean version. The quality of the wood blocks is attributed to the National Preceptor Sugi, the Buddhist monk in charge of the project, who carefully checked the Korean version for errors. Upon completing the Tripiṭaka Koreana, Sugi published 30 volumes of &quot;Additional Records&quot; which recorded errors, redundancies, and omissions he found during his comparisons of the different versions of the Tripiṭaka. Because of the relative completion of the Korea edition of the Chinese Buddhist Tripitaka, the Japanese Taisho edition of the Tripiṭaka was said also to have been based on the Korean edition. Some of the Tripiṭaka Koreana&#x27;s texts were even used in the Chinese edition of Zhonghua dazangjing which was based on the Jin edition which in turn was a sister edition sent to Korea.

The Tripiṭaka Koreana was one of the most coveted items among Japanese Buddhists in the Edo period. Japan never managed to create a woodblock Tripiṭaka, and made constant requests and attempts to acquire the Tripiṭaka Koreana from Korea since 1388. 45 complete printings of the Tripiṭaka Koreana were gifted to Japan since the Muromachi period. The Tripiṭaka Koreana was used as the basis for the modern Japanese Taishō Tripiṭaka.
Each block was made of birch wood from the southern islands of Korea and treated to prevent the decay of the wood. The blocks were soaked in sea water for three years, then cut and boiled in salt water. Next, the blocks were placed in the shade and exposed to the wind for three years, at which point they were ready to be carved. After each block was carved, it was coated in a poisonous lacquer to keep insects away and then framed with metal to prevent warping.

Every block was inscribed with 23 lines of text with 14 characters per line. Therefore, each block, counting both sides, contained a total of 644 characters. The consistency of the style - and some external sources - led people to believe that a single man carved the entire collection, but it is now estimated that a team of 30 men carved the Tripiṭaka.

The modern edition has 1514 texts in 47 volumes.

<doc id="327198" wikidata="Q490975" url="?curid=327198" title="Gayasan National Park">
<text>Gayasan National Park, also known as Gaya Mountain National Park (), is a large national park in the eastern part of South Korea. The park is named in honor of Gaya Mountain and became a National Park in 1972.

The park includes Haeinsa, which is one of the main temples of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism.

==Geography==
Gayasan National Park covers an area of more than 160 square kilometers. The national park extends from the northern edge of South Gyeongsang Province, to the southern limit of North Gyeongsang Province. The Sobaek Mountain range runs through this area.

===Gaya Mountain===

The national park is named in honor of Gaya Mountain. This mountain has two major peaks: one of them is Sangwangbong Peak, for which the height is 1,430 meters, and the other slightly higher peak, Chulbulbong, is 1,433 above sea level.

==Special features==
One significant feature of the national park is Haeinsa. This Buddhist temple includes in its grounds a standing Buddha figure carved into a vertical rock.

Another feature of the park is Yongmun Falls and Hongnyudong Valley. 380 different species of plant have been identified as growing there, as well as 100 species of birds, and other wild animals.

==History==
The area was declared scenic site number 5 by the Korean government in 1966, and it became an official National Park in 1972.

The remoteness of the area has played a role in protecting it from destruction in the past, specifically during the Japanese invasions of 1592-98, when much of the country was razed.

Since that time, legend says that the area around Gaya Mountains is free from the Three Disasters: fire, floods and wind.

==Gallery==
==Recreation==
Gayasan National Park has multiple hiking trails that run through the mountainous park. The most trafficked trail begins in Heinsa Temple and contains a guard station that provides park information for visitors.

There are three designated campgrounds within the borders of the park for day use and overnight tent camping.

<doc id="327200" wikidata="Q15262296" url="?curid=327200" title="Nicholas van Hoogstraten">
<text>Nicholas Adolf von Hessen (born Nicholas Marcel Hoogstraten, formerly known as Adolph von Hessen better known as Nicholas van Hoogstraten; born 25 February 1945) is a British businessman involved in property and a convicted criminal.

In 1968, he was convicted and sent to prison for four years after paying a gang to attack a business associate. In 2002, he was sentenced to 10 years for the manslaughter of a business rival; the verdict was overturned on appeal and he was subsequently released, but in 2005 he was ordered to pay the victim&#x27;s family £6 million in a civil case.

A huge mansion, Hamilton Palace, near Uckfield in East Sussex, which Van Hoogstraten began building in the mid-1980s, remains unfinished and uninhabited.

==Early life and career==
Hoogstraten was born in Shoreham-by-Sea, Sussex, to Charles, a violent man who worked as a shipping agent importing meat from Argentina who was absent for long periods in South America, and Edna Brookes, a housewife. He disliked them both and has described his mother as being &quot;a whining cow&quot;. The family also included two younger daughters. He was educated at a Jesuit school in nearby Worthing. At 15, he was given a year&#x27;s probation for his involvement in a stamp-stealing ring following an earlier warning when a stolen typewriter was found in his room.

He left school aged 16, and joined the merchant navy for a year. He began his property business in the Bahamas with an initial investment of £1,000 realised from the sale of his stamp collection. On his return to the UK, he moved to Notting Hill Gate and bought houses very cheaply because of rent controls, but specialised in &quot;persuading&quot; tenants to move out, using threatening practices associated with Peter Rachman, someone he has defended. Hoogstraten built up his capital through a loan sharking business based in towns along the south coast of England, where he would take property deeds as collateral. Many borrowers were unable to maintain his unreasonable payment terms and defaulted on their loans, losing their properties to him and enabling him to build up a substantial property portfolio along the south coast and in London.

By the age of 22, adding the &quot;van&quot; to his name at this stage, he owned 350 properties in Sussex and was reputedly Britain&#x27;s youngest millionaire, although &quot;The Times&quot; in 1967 and 1972 referred to this status as being &quot;self-styled&quot;.

By 1980, aged 35, he owned more than 2,000 properties. He later sold the majority of his housing to invest outside Britain, chiefly in mining and farming interests in Nigeria and, later, Zimbabwe.

==Convictions, imprisonment and other incidents==
Aged 22, he was convicted for paying a gang to throw a grenade into the house of Rabbi Bernard Braunstein, a Brighton cantor on 12 November 1967. Braunstein&#x27;s son David owed a debt to Hoogstraten over a failed textile business they had jointly owned. Hoogstraten had become dissatisfied with a repayment arrangement the two men had made. According to evidence given in court by Sylvia Braunstein, the wife of Braunstein senior, Hoogstraten had announced during a threatening altercation at the Braunsteins&#x27; home, where he had regularly dined: &quot;I&#x27;m a Fascist, and a Nazi, didn&#x27;t you know that? If I wanted, I could pay £50 to men in London to get every Jew in Brighton bumped off&quot;.

He was sentenced to a four-year prison sentence in May 1968, and sentenced to a further four-year sentence the following August, to run concurrently, after an appeal. In the second case, he was found guilty on eight counts of handling stolen goods. At a further appeal in 1970, the Lord Justice Wynn described Hoogstraten as &quot;a sort of self-imagined devil who likes to think of himself as an emissary of Beelzebub&quot;. Thinking Hoogstraten had &quot;built up a picture of himself as a sinister international figure&quot;, he believed Hoogstraten was little more than &quot;a child, a Walter Mitty character who will grow out of all this nonsense&quot;. Van Hoogstraten said of the grenade attack in 2000: &quot;It seems a bit distasteful to me now, but back then when I was young ... these weren&#x27;t anarchists, they were businessmen, respectable people&quot;.

Hoogstraten was arrested immediately after his release. In October 1972, he was sentenced to a further 15 months for bribing prison officers to smuggle him luxuries. He was freed on appeal. &quot;I ran Wormwood Scrubs when I was in there&quot;, he told Jane Kelly of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in January 2006. Also in 1972, he was fined for forcible entry and conspiracy to cause damage. Around 1979, he was fined £200 for punching and kicking a bailiff. During the 1980s, he was cleared of harassing tenants, but fined £1,500 for contempt of court after saying of a judge, &quot;I&#x27;ll get him in ten years time.&quot; In the early 1980s his businesses were restructured after the Inland Revenue sequestered his assets over a record unpaid tax bill of £5.3 million.

Residents of 2-6 Palmeira Square in Hove took van Hoogstraten to court in September 1999 alleging he had used multiple aliases as a shadow director of Saga Properties (which owned the freehold in 1991) to indicate interests in the flats to block a property deal on the freehold. The residents had eventually gained the right to the deal, which enabled them to buy the property, after a three-year legal case. They took van Hoogstraten to court in 1999 to recoup their £200,000 legal costs, a case which they also eventually won. In May 2000, van Hoogstraten was fined £1,500 in Hove Crown Court for contempt of court for his reference the previous September to barrister Graham Campbell during the case: &quot;You dirty bastard. In due course you are going to have it.&quot;

==Hamilton Palace (1985–present)==

On the site of the former High Cross House, a former nursing home destroyed by a fire of unknown cause, van Hoogstraten began constructing a private mansion he called Hamilton Palace, at Palehouse Common near Uckfield in East Sussex in the mid-1980s. According to Emma Brockes of &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2000, Hamilton Palace was named after the capital of Bermuda, where van Hoogstraten owns property.

Construction of the mansion began in 1985 and had cost around £40 million by 2006. The neoclassical palace features a copper dome. The enormous edifice is intended to house his private collection of art, currently stored in Switzerland, and includes a marble mausoleum he intends for himself. Under English law, perpetual trusts are only allowed in the upkeep of monuments and graves. By using the palace as a mausoleum, van Hoogstraten&#x27;s trust would legally own the buildings and their fittings in perpetuity after his death. A large portion of his wealth has been transferred into a Bermudan trust for the upkeep of historic monuments. The structure of the mansion and ancillary buildings was largely in place, but van Hoogstraten fell out with architect Anthony Browne in 2000 and the site remained unfinished. Recent drone footage shows an abandoned building surrounded by scaffolding on which foliage is growing.

He was involved in a long-running dispute with the Ramblers&#x27; Association and a legal battle with the local authority over a right of way crossing the land around the mansion. In 1990, he had the public paths blocked with razor wire and a pile of discarded refrigerators. In 2000, he described his opponents in the case as being &quot;a bunch of disenfranchised perverts&quot;.

In 2002, a Ramblers&#x27; campaigner took legal action against a decision by the East Sussex county council to divert the 140-year old Framfield path which crosses Van Hoogstraten&#x27;s estate resulting in the Court of Appeal finding against the council. Rarebargain, a company registered as owners of the land and connected to Van Hoogstraten, had earlier been fined £86,350 for neglecting to restore the right of way. The fine was not paid and the company was then in the process of being wound up. After six court cases, the right of way was finally cleared in 2003 with the removal of a pair of industrial refrigeration units, half-a-dozen concrete piles, barbed wire and other impediments.

When neighbours called for the property to be used for the homeless in early 2016, van Hoogstraten said in a statement: &quot;The &#x27;homeless&#x27; – the majority of whom are so by their own volition or sheer laziness – are one of the filthiest burdens on the public purse today. The chance of my offering an opportunity for them to occupy Hamilton Palace is just ludicrous.&quot; He also denied that the project had stalled, saying &quot;Even the most moronic of peasants would be able to see from the pictures that we have been busy landscaping the grounds of the Palace.&quot;

==Mohammed Raja case==
Some time in the early 1980s, Hoogstraten began a business relationship with Mohammed Sabir Raja, an immigrant from Pakistan who worked in Brighton as an estate agent and landlord. Hoogstraten lent money to Raja at a lower rate than the banks, and the loans were not recorded on paper so as to avoid paying taxes. Raja used this money to buy properties.

Their relationship went well until the housing-price bubble burst in 1989. Raja failed to foresee the drop in prices and kept buying, which eventually put him in financial trouble. In desperation, Raja raised a building society mortgage on a property for which he already owed money to Hoogstraten. Hoogstraten discovered this, and demanded additional security for his loans to Raja.

Raja gave Hoogstraten the deeds to some of his properties. Raja also signed some blank property transfer forms and gave them to Hoogstraten. Hoogstraten could then fill in the name of any of Raja&#x27;s properties on these forms and thereby transfer ownership to himself, which he promised to do if Raja defaulted on his loans (this was not the first time Raja had done this with Hoogstraten). Raja did default, and Hoogstraten in turn seized some of Raja&#x27;s properties using those forms. Hoogstraten and Raja began arguing over how much money was still owed.

In October 1993, Raja went to the High Court alleging breach of trust, demanded the return of the property deeds he had lodged with Hoogstraten, and alleged that Hoogstraten had fraudulently seized his properties using blank transfer forms. In April 1998, Raja sued Hoogstraten for conspiracy and fraud.

On the morning of 2 July 1999, two of Hoogstraten&#x27;s hired thugs, disguised as handymen, arrived at Raja&#x27;s residence. When Raja answered the door to them, a fight broke out. Raja was stabbed five times in the heart and neck and was shot in the head twice at point blank range, dying as a consequence.

In July 2002, van Hoogstraten was sentenced to 10 years&#x27; imprisonment for the manslaughter of Raja, after being found not guilty of murder: a jury at the Old Bailey decided that &quot;although he clearly wanted Mr Raja harmed, there is no evidence that he had intended Mr Raja to be murdered&quot;. This conviction was subsequently quashed by the Court of Appeal in July 2003.

The preliminary hearing for the retrial was held at the Old Bailey on 17 November 2003, before the High Court Judge, Sir Stephen Mitchell. In his summary to the jury, Judge Newman neglected to mention that one of the thugs who killed Raja possessed a sawn-off shotgun (a lethal weapon). Because of this omission, Judge Mitchell decided that Hoogstraten could not have anticipated that Raja might have been killed and he acquitted Hoogstraten of manslaughter. He was released in December after a potential retrial for manslaughter was found to have no legal foundation.

In the early part of 2005, Hoogstraten&#x27;s strategy of dispensing with his own legal Counsel and inexplicably mounting his own defence by acting in person, ignoring the Judge&#x27;s advice to abandon such behaviour, led to the judgement on the 19 December 2005 in favour and for the family of Raja, in their civil action against van Hoogstraten and were awarded £6 million by Mr Justice Lightman, after the court found that on the balance of probabilities &quot;that the recruitment of the two thugs was for the purpose of murdering Mr Raja and not merely to frighten, threaten or hurt him&quot;.

Van Hoogstraten was not held guilty of Raja&#x27;s murder or manslaughter under English criminal law, which requires a jury to be &quot;certain so as to be sure of guilt&quot; rather than operating on balance of probabilities. He allegedly told the BBC that Raja&#x27;s family &quot;will never get a penny&quot;. He explained to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; that he had &quot;no assets at all now in the UK&quot;, having placed those assets in the names of five children he has reportedly fathered with a series of African girlfriends. Frequently interviewed in the Courtlands Hotel in Hove, it is a property with which he has &quot;close connections&quot;, but which is legally owned by his children.

In February 2018, a judge accepted van Hoogstraten&#x27;s claim that he did not have the money or assets to pay the family. Describing van Hoogstraten&#x27;s conduct as &quot;wholly deplorable and contemptuous&quot;, Mr Justice Morgan said: &quot;If there was any way I could make Mr van Hoogstraten pay for all this under the law, I would gladly do it.&quot;

==Later life==
Hoogstraten first bought an estate in Zimbabwe (then Rhodesia) in 1964, aged 19. At around the same time he became friends with Tiny Rowland, who was then in charge of the London and Rhodesian Mining Company.

He was a close associate of the country&#x27;s former leader Robert Mugabe, whom he described as &quot;100 per cent decent and incorruptible&quot;; van Hoogstraten has said he &quot;[does not] believe in democracy, I believe in rule by the fittest&quot;.

In 2005, he announced plans to take over NMB, a major Zimbabwe bank, though he sold his stake in the bank for over £1 million in late 2007. In 2009, it was reported he had been &quot;a generous contributor to Mugabe&#x27;s Zanu (PF) party and [had] bought into several large state-owned companies&quot;.

In January 2006, he stated in an interview with &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; that, as a result of loaning £10 million to Mugabe, &quot;In six months&#x27; time, when the interest is due, it would be cheaper for them to just kill me&quot;.

On 26 January 2008, he was arrested in Harare for allegedly demanding payment in US dollars for rents rather than in Zimbabwean dollars, which is forbidden under Zimbabwean law. He was charged with violating the Censorship Act by possessing pornographic photographs; women in &quot;indecent poses&quot;, a proportion of which also featured van Hoogstraten himself.

On 3 July 2009, after he had reputedly changed his name to Nicholas Adolf von Hessen by deed poll, it was reported that a Zimbabwe court had dismissed the charges of illegal currency dealing and possession of pornography: the police were unable to produce the officer who had allegedly caught him on the currency charge and they had seized the pornography without a warrant. Van Hoogstraten has said he uses many pseudonyms to conceal his involvement in property dealings in apparent contravention of UK company directorship laws, He told &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; in 2000: &quot;I&#x27;ve actually called myself, in the past, Yogi Bear. And I&#x27;ve had properties registered in that name.&quot;

Van Hoogstraten told Lynn Barber, writing for &quot;The Observer&quot; in 2006, that he pays for the education of three children in every school in Zimbabwe: &quot;Actually, it doesn&#x27;t cost a lot of money in real terms, but I&#x27;ve set up things like that that will continue&quot;.

==Van Hoogstraten in popular culture==
* On 13 August 1988, van Hoogstraten made an extended appearance on the British television discussion programme &quot;After Dark&quot;, alongside Marie Jahoda and Owen Oyston, among others.
* &quot;Sitting Targets&quot;, an episode in the BBC Two &quot;Screen Two&quot; anthology series (19 March 1989), was a fictionalised account of the legal victory won by the actress Leslee Udwin against van Hoogstraten after his harassment of her and her fellow tenants in their Rent Act-protected apartment block in west London, which he had bought. Udwin played a fictionalised version of herself, alongside Jonathan Hyde as evil landlord Vincent Stott.
* In the song &quot;Sheriff Fatman&quot;, the anti-hero of the song is an unscrupulous businessman, &quot;infamous for fifteen minutes&quot;, who is compared with &quot;Nicholas van Whats-his-face&quot;, considered by many critics to be a transparent reference to van Hoogstraten.

<text>Knoydart () is a peninsula in Lochaber, Highland, on the west coast of Scotland. Knoydart is sandwiched between Lochs Nevis and Hourn — often translated as &quot;Loch Heaven&quot; (from the Gaelic &quot;Loch Néimh&quot;) and &quot;Loch Hell&quot; (Gaelic: &quot;Loch Iutharn&quot;) respectively, although the somewhat poetic nature of these derivations is disputed. Forming the northern part of what is traditionally known as &quot;na Garbh-Chrìochan&quot; or &quot;the Rough Bounds&quot;, because of its harsh terrain and remoteness, Knoydart is also referred to as &quot;Britain&#x27;s last wilderness&quot;. It is only accessible by boat, or by a 16-mile (26 km) walk through rough country, and the seven miles (11 km) of tarred road are not connected to the UK road system.

Knoydart is designated as one of the forty national scenic areas in Scotland, which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure their protection from inappropriate development. The designated area covers in total, of which is on land, with a further being marine (i.e. below low tide level).

The area is popular with hill walkers, mountaineers, sailors and wildlife enthusiasts. It includes the Munros of Ladhar Bheinn (1020 m), Luinne Bheinn (939 m), Meall Buidhe (946 m) and Sgurr na Cìche (1040 m). The peninsula also contains six Corbetts, including Ben Aden (887 m) and Beinn na Caillich (785 m).

==History==

Knoydart formed part of the kingdom ruled over by Somerled (died 1164), before passing to the Clann Ruaidhrí branch of his descendants – the eventual heiress of whom married John of Islay (died circa 1386). Members of Clan Donald held Knoydart from the 15th century to the beginning of the 17th century is generally believed to have descended from Allan Macdonald, 2nd of Clanranald (died circa 1429). However, in the early 17th century, Macdonell of Glengarry succeeded in wresting control of Knoydart from Clanranald, receiving official confirmation of his ownership from the king in 1613. Prior to the 1745 Jacobite rising the population numbered nearly a thousand. There was much emigration, mainly to Canada (Knoydart, Nova Scotia is named after the community). 

In an April 1787 letter from Moidart to the Congregation for Propaganda in Rome, Fr. Austin MacDonald wrote, &quot;On account of the emigration of the people of Knoydart to Canada, along with their priest; it fell to me in the autumn to attend to those who were left behind, and during the winter to the people of Moydart (sic) as well. Although not less than 600 Catholics went to America, still I administered the Sacraments to over 500 souls who remained. The overpopulation of these districts, together with the oppression of the landlords, are the principal causes of the departure of so many, not only among the Catholics, but also among the Protestants.&quot;

Despite this emigration, the population remained at nearly a thousand in 1841.

In 1852 four hundred of the inhabitants were given notice of eviction for the following year and offered passages overseas, originally to Australia, but later their destination was changed to Canada. On 9 August 1853 three hundred and thirty inhabitants from the west coast of the peninsula went on board the &quot;Sillery&quot; and left for Canada. However, 11 families comprising over 60 people refused to go and the story of their eviction became notorious as part of the Highland Clearances. Knoydart was finally sold by the MacDonell family in 1856, passing into the hands of an Ayrshire ironmaster, James Baird of Cambusdoon.

In 1948, an unsuccessful land raid was undertaken by the &quot;Seven Men of Knoydart&quot;, who attempted to claim land in the ownership of the estate for their own use. Their claims were contested by the estate owner, the Second Baron Brocket, who took the case to the Court of Session which ruled against the land-raiders. An appeal to the Secretary of State for Scotland was rejected and the Seven Men gave up their fight to obtain crofts on Knoydart. A cairn commemorating their land raid was unveiled at Inverie in 1981.

==Modern ownership==
The Knoydart Foundation was established in 1997 to take ownership of the Knoydart Estate which makes up much of the peninsula, including the village of Inverie. The Foundation, which is a registered charity under Scottish law, bought the estate in 1999. It is a partnership of local residents, the Highland Council, the Chris Brasher Trust, and the John Muir Trust. The foundation aim is to &quot;manage the Knoydart Estate as an area of employment and settlement on the Knoydart Peninsula without detriment to its natural beauty and character and to seek and encourage the preservation of its landscape, wildlife, natural resources, culture and rural heritage.&quot;

The neighbouring privately owned Kilchoan Estate was part of the foundation when it was set up, but have since resigned their directorship. Kilchoan Estate covers of the peninsula, and lies to the east of the Knoydart Foundation land. Other landholdings on Knoydart include the Camusrory Estate (lying to the east of the Kilchoan Estate), and the Barisdale Estate on the northern side of the peninsula, which extends as far east as Kinloch Hourn. of land on the northern slopes of Ladhar Bheinn is owned by the John Muir Trust, one of the participants in the Knoydart Foundation.

==Infrastructure==
Inverie is the main settlement on the peninsula, which has a resident population of 98 adults. There is a post office, a primary school, a brewery and a variety of accommodation for visitors, including B&amp;Bs, bunkhouses and self-catering accommodation. The Old Forge Inn, Knoydart&#x27;s only pub, is the most remote public house in mainland Britain.

A vehicle track runs from Inverie to the smaller settlement of Airor, on the west side of the peninsula, a little over . On its way to Airor, the track passes the settlements of Scottas, Sandaig and Doune. The track is a designated public highway and is maintained by the Highland Council – however in common with the Small Isles, a resident or visitors permit is required to drive on the road.

The Highland Council-subsidised ferry is operated from Mallaig to Inverie by Western Isles Cruises, previously known as Bruce Watt Cruises. For a period of three years Knoydart Sea Bridge had the council contract; this reverted to Western Isles Cruises on 1 April 2016. Various passenger and equipment services are offered by private boat operators.
The Foundation operates a hydro-electric scheme which provides power to Inverie as the area is entirely off the national grid. The scheme is almost entirely dependent on unpaid volunteers and the current pipeline will need replacing in the near future. As a result, the Knoydart community&#x27;s current focus is coming up with a solution to ensure a continued power supply and ultimately that living on Knoydart remains viable.

In May 2005 the Highlands and Islands Community Energy Company hosted its first conference in Inverie, during which the company was officially launched. A new pier at Inverie was officially opened on 24 August 2006 by Tavish Scott MSP. In 2019 the Knoydart Foundation are celebrating 20 years of community ownership. They are fundraising for and undertaking extensive renovations to Knoydart Community Hall, which provides an essential meeting space and venue for visiting bands and musicians, sports and activities, community events, school, Foundation and Ranger events, activities and meetings, and parties and weddings.

As of March 2022, the Knoydart community owns the most remote mainland pub in the UK, The Old Forge, after buying the pub&#x27;s building and making the essential renovations. Old Forge and the village itself can only be accessed by walking for 18 miles (29 km) or crossing the sea for 7 miles (11 km). It is expected that the pub will attract thousands of visitors in the upcoming years.

Knoydart is not connected to the National Grid, it gets its electricity from a 280 kW hydroelectric scheme run by a community trust called Knoydart Renewables.

==Natural environment==
The underlying geology of Knoydart consists mainly of mica-schist and quartz-feldspar of the type associated with the Moine thrust, along with some areas of Lewisian gneiss around Loch Hourn. The landscape shows many signs of glaciation, with deep fjord-like sea lochs, hanging valleys, corries, arêtes and moraines. The rebound effect that followed the melting of the glaciers at the end of the ice age has led to the formation of raised beaches.

Birchwoods grow on the steep slopes of the glens and above the shoreline, and there are some areas of Caledonian pinewoods around Barrisdale. In common with much of the highlands, historic overgrazing, first by sheep and latterly by deer (predominantly red deer), has led to a reduction in the amount of forested land. The deer population is therefore managed by culling in order to allow existing native woodland to regenerate over the long term. The estates on the western part of the peninsula cooperate in this aim via the West Knoydart Deer Management Group, whilst the more easterly estates form the Knoydart Deer Management Group, whose area takes in much of The Rough Bounds of Knoydart. There was controversy in 2015 following culling on the John Muir Trust land in the north of Knoydart, which resulted in some deer carcasses being left on the open hillside rather than being extracted for use as venison.

Wildlife in the area includes badgers, pine marten, otters, red deer, buzzards, golden eagles and sea eagles; there are also two small herds of feral goats. There is a wildlife hide on the beach near Inverie. The seas to the west of Knoydart are designated as a Special Area of Conservation due their importance for harbour porpoises.

<doc id="327206" wikidata="Q3117683" url="?curid=327206" title="Fischer group">
<text>In the area of modern algebra known as group theory, the Fischer groups are the three sporadic simple groups Fi22, Fi23 and Fi24 introduced by .

== 3-transposition groups ==
The Fischer groups are named after Bernd Fischer who discovered them while investigating 3-transposition groups. 
These are groups &quot;G&quot; with the following properties:
* &quot;G&quot; is generated by a conjugacy class of elements of order 2, called &#x27;Fischer transpositions&#x27; or 3-transpositions.
* The product of any two distinct transpositions has order 2 or 3.

The typical example of a 3-transposition group is a symmetric group,
where the Fischer transpositions are genuinely transpositions. The symmetric group Sn can be generated by transpositions: (12), (23), ..., .

Fischer was able to classify 3-transposition groups that satisfy certain extra technical conditions. The groups he found fell mostly into several infinite classes (besides symmetric groups: certain classes of symplectic, unitary, and orthogonal groups), but he also found 3 very large new groups. These groups are usually referred to as Fi22, Fi23 and Fi24. The first two of these are simple groups, and the third contains the simple group Fi24′ of index 2.

A starting point for the Fischer groups is the unitary group PSU6(2), which could be thought of as a group Fi21 in the series of Fischer groups, of order . Actually it is the double cover 2.PSU6(2) that becomes a subgroup of the new group. This is the stabilizer of one vertex in a graph of 3510 (= 2⋅33⋅5⋅13). These vertices are identified as conjugate 3-transpositions in the symmetry group Fi22 of the graph.

The Fischer groups are named by analogy with the large Mathieu groups. In Fi22 a maximal set of 3-transpositions all commuting with one another has size 22 and is called a &quot;basic&quot; set. There are 1024 3-transpositions, called &quot;anabasic&quot; that do not commute with any in the particular basic set. Any one of other 2464, called &quot;hexadic&quot;, commutes with 6 basic ones. The sets of 6 form an S(3,6,22) Steiner system, whose symmetry group is M22. A basic set generates an abelian group of order 210, which extends in Fi22 to a subgroup 210:M22.

The next Fischer group comes by regarding 2.Fi22 as a one-point stabilizer for a graph of 31671 (= 34⋅17⋅23) vertices, and treating these vertices as the 3-transpositions in a group Fi23. The 3-transpositions come in basic sets of 23, 7 of which commute with a given outside 3-transposition.

Next one takes Fi23 and treats it as a one-point stabilizer for a graph of 306936 (= 23⋅33⋅72⋅29) vertices to make a group Fi24. The 3-transpositions come in basic sets of 24, eight of which commute with a given outside 3-transposition. The group Fi24 is not simple, but its derived subgroup has index 2 and is a sporadic simple group.

== Notation ==
There is no uniformly accepted notation for these groups. Some authors use F in place of Fi (F22, for example).
Fischer&#x27;s notation for them was M(22), M(23) and M(24)′, which emphasised their close relationship with the three largest
Mathieu groups, M22, M23 and M24.

One particular source of confusion is that Fi24 is sometimes used to refer to the simple group Fi24′, and is sometimes used to refer to the full 3-transposition group (which is twice the size).

==Generalized Monstrous Moonshine==
John H. Conway and Simon P. Norton suggested in their 1979 paper that monstrous moonshine is not limited to the monster, but that similar phenomena may be found for other groups. Larissa Queen and others subsequently found that one can construct the expansions of many Hauptmoduln (main or principal moduli) from simple combinations of dimensions of sporadic groups.

<text>The Siletz Reservation is a 5.852 sq mi (15.157 km2) Indian reservation in Lincoln County, Oregon, United States, owned by the Confederated Tribes of Siletz. The reservation is made up of numerous non-contiguous parcels of land in east-central Lincoln County, mostly east of the city of Siletz, between it and the Polk County line.

==History==

===Establishment===
In November 1855 President of the United States Franklin Pierce issued an executive order creating a reservation for the relocation of the indigenous peoples of the coastal region of the Oregon Territory. A 120-mile-long strip of land was designated for the Coast Indian Reservation. This reservation extended from Cape Lookout in Tillamook County on the north coast, extending to the Siltcoos River, near Florence in the South.

As Oregon&#x27;s population grew, the federal government opened up some reservation lands for settlement by white newcomers, who displaced the indigenous peoples. The reservation Area was reduced and fragmented by the executive order December 21, 1865 of President Andrew Johnson and by the Act of Congress March 3, 1875. Tribal groups reestablished a presence in isolated portions of their traditional homelands.

Under the Dawes Act of 1887, the government divided communal tribal lands for allocation of individual plots of 160 acres each to heads of households of tribal members; any remaining acreage was classified as &quot;surplus&quot; and sold to non-natives. This break-up of communal lands accelerated the process of atomization of the state&#x27;s indigenous peoples.

Since the late 20th century, the federally recognized Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians has established casino gambling on its lands and generated monies for its people&#x27;s welfare, as well as contributing to county needs.

== Culture and lifestyle ==

=== Tribal housing ===
The Siletz tribe has built several different areas for tribal members to live. The tribe has created a rent-to-buy style program so that tribal members are able to own their own houses. The tribe has also created elders housing units for the elderly tribal members, and they boast several different areas where members are able to rent tribal apartments, these apartments are spread all over the city on tribal properties.

=== Tribal events ===
The Siletz reservation is home to many tribal programs. The most prominent is the annual celebration held in Siletz on top of Government Hill, the Nesika Illahee Pow-wow. This event happens during the second weekend of August. The pow-wow opens up every year with a parade and leads into the celebration that lasts all weekend. Siletz is also home to many other cultural events such as a culture camp, youth activities, and activities for elders. The reservation also houses the Siletz dance house where solstice celebrations take place along with many other events like weddings and coming-of-age ceremonies.

== Education ==
There is one K-12th grade school in Siletz, the Siletz Valley Charter School also known as the Siletz Valley Early College Academy. The school had been closed for many years but reopened in 2006 due to funding provided by Chinook Winds Casino. It is a public school within the Lincoln County School District.
